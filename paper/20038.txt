Uncertainty, Financial Frictions, and Investment Dynamics

ABSTRACT
Micro- and macro-level evidence indicates that fluctuations in idiosyncratic uncertainty have a large
effect on investment; the impact of uncertainty on investment occurs primarily through changes in
credit spreads; and innovations in credit spreads have a strong effect on investment, irrespective of
the level of uncertainty. These findings raise a question regarding the economic significance of the
traditional “wait-and-see” effect of uncertainty shocks and point to financial distortions as the main
mechanism through which fluctuations in uncertainty affect macroeconomic outcomes. The relative
importance of these two mechanisms is analyzed within a quantitative general equilibrium model,
featuring heterogeneous firms that face time-varying idiosyncratic uncertainty, irreversibility, nonconvex
capital adjustment costs, and financial frictions. The model successfully replicates the stylized facts
concerning the macroeconomic implications of uncertainty and financial shocks. By influencing the
effective supply of credit, both types of shocks exert a powerful effect on investment and generate
countercyclical credit spreads and procyclical leverage, dynamics consistent with the data and counter
to those implied by the technology-driven real business cycle models.

Introduction

Macroeconomists have made a convincing argument that the well-documented countercyclical behavior of the cross-sectional dispersion of economic variables such as labor income, business profits, productivity, and stock returns reflects fluctuations in the volatility of the underlying economic shocks—that is, swings in economic uncertainty.1 How such uncertainty fluctuations influence business cycle dynamics has traditionally been analyzed within the framework of irreversible investment (see Bernanke, 1983; Bertola and Caballero, 1994; Abel and Eberly, 1994, 1996;
Caballero and Pindyck, 1996; Bloom, 2009; Bloom et al., 2011; Bachmann and Bayer, 2009, 2013).
This approach to corporate resource allocation treats the firm’s future investment opportunities as
“real options” and emphasizes the importance of waiting and staging flexibility when making investment decisions—in response to increased uncertainty, firms should wait and see until uncertainty
is resolved and the project is more clearly successful.2
Spurred by the surge in asset price volatility and the blowout in credit spreads during the
2007–09 financial crisis, an emergent literature has pointed to financial market frictions as an
additional channel through which volatility fluctuations can affect macroeconomic outcomes (see
Arellano et al., 2012; Christiano et al., 2014). According to the canonical framework used to price
risky debt, the return on levered equity resembles—under limited liability—the payoff of a call
option, whereas the bondholders face the payoff structure that mimics that of an investor writing
a put option. An increase in the riskiness of the firm’s assets thus benefits equity holders at the
expense of bondholders, implying a rise in credit spreads to compensate bondholders for heightened
uncertainty. To the extent that external finance—both through the debt and equity markets—is
subject to agency and/or moral hazard problems, an increase in uncertainty will raise the user cost
of capital, inducing a decline in investment spending.
Given these two complementary channels of how changes in uncertainty can affect the real
economy, this paper seeks to answer the following question: How much of the impact of fluctuations in uncertainty on aggregate investment reflects capital adjustment frictions associated
with irreversibility—the traditional wait-and-see effect—and how much of it can be attributed to
distortions in financial markets? We answer this question by developing a quantitative business
cycle model that allows us to analyze the effect of fluctuations in uncertainty on investment dynamics in a general equilibrium setting featuring partial irreversibility and frictions in both the
debt and equity markets. Specifically, we formulate a capital accumulation problem, in which het1

See Campbell and Taksler (2003), Storesletten et al. (2004), Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), Bloom (2009), and
Bloom et al. (2011) for arguments and evidence. It is worth emphasizing, however, that there is no objective measure
of time-varying economic uncertainty. In addition to the uncertainty proxies noted above, this burgeoning literature has employed indexes based on the frequency of “uncertainty-related” words or phrases that occur across a
large number of news sources (Baker et al., 2013), the cross-sectional dispersion of survey-based business forecasts
(Bachmann et al., 2013b), and the common variation in the unforecastable component of a large number of economic
indicators (Jurado et al., 2013) to infer fluctuations in uncertainty.
2
Despite its intuitive appeal, the effect of uncertainty on investment in the presence of irreversibilities can be
theoretically ambiguous. As shown, for example, by Abel (1983) and Veracierto (2002), the effect depends importantly
on the assumptions regarding the initial accumulation of capital, market structure, and the equilibrium setting.

erogeneous firms employ a decreasing returns-to-scale production technology that is subject to a
persistent idiosyncratic shock, the variance of which is allowed to vary over time according to a
stochastic law of motion. The capital accumulation problem is subject to partial irreversibility
and fixed adjustment costs, two forms of adjustment frictions emphasized in the influential work of
Abel and Eberly (1994, 1996), Caballero et al. (1995), Doms and Dunne (1998), Caballero (1999),
Cooper et al. (1999), Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006), and Bachmann et al. (2013a).
On the financial side, firms make investment decisions subject to a full range of choices regarding their capital structure—internal funds, debt, and equity financing—in an environment where
external funds are costly because of agency problems in financial markets. The partial investment
irreversibility plays two roles in our model. First, it creates the option value of waiting. In response to increased uncertainty, the investment inaction region expands, which causes some firms
to delay exercising their growth options—that is, they adopt a wait-and-see posture. Second, the
greater downside risk limits the firms’ debt capacity because heightened uncertainty—under limited liability—favors the firm’s shareholders over its bondholders, thereby inducing a decline in
the market value of debt claims. Thus, the model provides a unified quantitative framework for
analyzing the implications of the interaction between the capital and debt overhang problems for
business cycle dynamics.3
Our analysis of the interaction between uncertainty and financial conditions is informed importantly by new empirical evidence that highlights the strong relationship between uncertainty,
investment, and credit spreads on corporate bonds, a commonly used indicator of the degree of financial market frictions.4 Specifically, we construct a new proxy for idiosyncratic uncertainty using
high-frequency firm-level stock market data, a measure that arguably reflects exogenous changes
in uncertainty, rather than the endogenous effects of informational and contractual frictions that
have been theoretically linked to the countercyclical dispersion in economic returns. For a subset
of large corporations, we match this estimate of uncertainty to the firms’ income and balance sheet
statements and, most importantly, to prices of their individual corporate bonds trading in the
secondary market.
Using this novel micro-level data set, we find that conditional on the firm’s leverage, profitability, and other indicators of creditworthiness, idiosyncratic volatility is an important determinant of credit spreads on the firm’s outstanding bonds. We also show that conditional on investment fundamentals—that is, proxies for the marginal product of capital—increases in idiosyncratic
volatility are associated with a substantial decline in the rate of capital formation. However, once
the information content of credit spreads is taken into account, the impact of uncertainty on business
3
Earlier theoretical explorations of this interaction can be found in Shleifer and Vishny (1992), Eisfeldt (2004),
and Manso (2008).
4
The fact that the level of credit spreads provides a useful metric for gauging the tightness of financial conditions
in the economy and thus the implied degree of departure from the Modigliani–Miller paradigm of frictionless financial
markets is supported by considerable empirical evidence showing that corporate bond credit spreads form the most
informative and reliable class of financial indicators for future economic activity and that shocks to credit spreads
lead to adverse macroeconomic outcomes (see Gertler and Lown, 1999; Gilchrist et al., 2009; Gilchrist and Zakrajšek,
2012; Faust et al., 2013).

investment is significantly attenuated. Capital expenditures, by contrast, remain highly responsive
to movements in credit spreads.
To gauge the macroeconomic implications of these findings, we use a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework to examine the interaction between uncertainty, credit spreads, and
economic activity. The results from this macro-level analysis confirm our finding that credit spreads
are an important conduit through which fluctuations in volatility are propagated to the real economy. By inducing a significant widening of credit spreads, unanticipated increases in uncertainty
lead to a decline in real GDP that is driven primarily by the protracted drop in the investment
component of aggregate spending. In contrast, financial disturbances—identified vis-à-vis orthogonalized shocks to credit spreads—have a large effect on economic activity, irrespective of the level
of uncertainty. The combination of the micro- and macro-level results is thus consistent with the
notion that financial frictions are an important part of the mechanism through which uncertainty
shocks affect the economy.
Simulations of our general equilibrium model accord well with the empirical results. By altering
the effective supply of credit, financial distortions significantly amplify the response of business
investment to volatility shocks. Although the risk-free rate falls in response to increased uncertainty,
this easing of financial conditions is more than offset by the sharp and persistent increase in credit
spreads. The resulting increase in the user cost of capital leads firms to slash capital outlays
and delever, creating a quantitatively important channel through which fluctuations in uncertainty
shape business cycle dynamics. In an economy without financial distortions, by contrast, this user
cost of capital channel is significantly attenuated, and the response of investment to uncertainty
shocks is an amalgam of the wait-and-see decisions of individual firms.
These findings are consistent with those of Christiano et al. (2014), who analyze the macroeconomic implications of volatility shocks in the context of a financial accelerator model adapted from
Bernanke et al. (1999), a framework that abstracts from both investment irreversibility and persistent heterogeneity in firm-level outcomes. While Arellano et al. (2012) consider such firm-level
heterogeneity, their model does not include capital accumulation and focuses on how increases in
uncertainty affect the ability of firms to finance their labor input. In addition, both of these papers
consider debt as the sole source of external finance. In contrast, we consider a general equilibrium
model with heterogeneous firms facing time-varying idiosyncratic uncertainty, partial investment
irreversibility, fixed investment costs, and frictions in both the debt and equity markets. Within
the context of our calibrated model, these features allow us to quantify explicitly the extent to
which the response of aggregate investment to an uncertainty shock is due to the “real options”
effect or distortions in financial markets.
The combination of costly reversible investment and financial market frictions also allows us
to identify a potential new source of aggregate disturbances: shocks to the liquidation (or resale)
value of capital. With partial irreversibility, an adverse shock to the liquidation value of capital
impinges on the debt capacity of firms by reducing the collateral value of capital assets, creating an
interaction between the capacity and debt overhang problems. According to our simulations, such

3

“capital liquidity” shocks have the potential of being an important source of cyclical fluctuations
in an economy with financial frictions.5 A relatively small amount of variability in the liquidation
value of capital generates a plausible degree of volatility in the model’s key endogenous aggregates
and delivers realistic comovements between main macroeconomic quantities. Importantly, the simulations show that when the business cycle is driven by either uncertainty or capital liquidity
shocks, the level of credit spreads and their cross-sectional dispersion are strongly countercyclical,
comovements consistent with the data.
In an economy with financial distortions, uncertainty and capital liquidity shocks induce a
deterioration in the quality of borrowers’ balance sheets, which causes the effective supply of credit
to shift inward, thus making quantities and spreads move in the opposite direction. Although
our model does not include a formal financial intermediary sector, disturbances that affect the
collateral value of capital assets can be viewed as a tractable way to model disruptions in the creditintermediation process. Thus, our model generates macroeconomic dynamics that are consistent
with the empirical evidence of Stock and Watson (2012), who argue that the toxic combination of
adverse uncertainty and credit supply shocks were the two primary drivers of the drop in economic
activity during the “Great Recession.”

Empirical Evidence

To infer both the cross-sectional and time-series variation in uncertainty, we look to asset prices,
which, in principle, should encompass all aspects of the firm’s environment that the investors view
as important. Moreover, by using information from financial markets—specifically from the stock
market—we can rely on a standard asset pricing framework to purge our measure of uncertainty
of forecastable variation. Using this proxy, we show that financial conditions, as summarized by
the level of credit spreads, significantly influence the response of investment to fluctuations in
idiosyncratic uncertainty. In fact, our empirical evidence indicates that the impact of uncertainty
on investment occurs primarily through changes in credit spreads, a result consistent with the
presence of significant financial market frictions.

Uncertainty, Financial Conditions, and Investment

In this section, we use a novel micro-level data set to document the tight link between corporate bond credit spreads and uncertainty and to shed light on how the interaction of uncertainty
and credit spreads affects investment dynamics. First, however, we describe the construction of
our benchmark estimate of time-varying idiosyncratic uncertainty. Specifically, from the Center
5

This result echoes the recent work of Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), who show that a deterioration in asset
market liquidity—a decline of the worst case liquidation value of capital—can lead to a significant increase in the
endogenous risk in the economy. In their framework, the increase in endogenous risk is generated by an adverse
feedback loop between the net worth of financially constrained agents and the market value of capital assets. In
our model, by contrast, the increase in endogenous risk in response to a capital liquidity shock arises from the link
between the liquidation value of capital assets and the firms’ debt capacity and the impact of that interaction on
broader financial conditions.

for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data base, we extracted daily stock returns for all U.S.
nonfinancial corporations with at least 1,250 trading days (essentially five years) of data. This
selection criterion yielded a panel of 11,303 firms over the period from July 1, 1963 (1963:Q3) to
September 30, 2012 (2012:Q3).6
Our estimate of uncertainty is based on the following two-step procedure. First, we remove the
forecastable variation in daily excess returns using the standard (linear) factor model:
(Ritd − rtfd ) = αi + β ′i ftd + uitd ,

(1)

where i indexes firms and td , d = 1, . . . , Dt , indexes trading days in quarter t. In equation (1), Ritd
denotes the (total) daily return of firm i, rtfd is the risk-free rate, and ftd is a vector of observable risk
factors. In implementing the first step, we employ a 4-factor model—namely, the Fama and French
(1992) 3-factor model, augmented with the momentum risk factor proposed by Carhart (1997).
In the second step, we calculate the quarterly firm-specific standard deviation of daily idiosyncratic returns, according to

d=1 ûitd is the sample mean of daily idiosyncratic returns in quarter t. Thus, σit in equation (2) is an estimate of time-varying equity volatility for firm i, a measure that is purged of the

forecastable variation in expected returns and thus is less likely to reflect the countercyclical nature
of contractual and informational frictions.
To analyze how fluctuations in this measure of idiosyncratic uncertainty influence financial
conditions, we extracted from the master firm-level data set a subset of more than 1,100 large firms
that have a significant portion of outstanding liabilities in the form of long-term bonds actively
traded in the secondary market.7 Using this data set, we estimate the following credit-spread
regression:

where sit [k] denotes the credit spread of a bond issue k in period t, a security that is a liability
of firm i. In addition to our estimate of idiosyncratic uncertainty σit , credit spreads are allowed
to depend on the firm’s recent financial performance, as measured by the realized quarterly stock

constant, a vector of bond-specific control variables Xit [k] (not reported), and are estimated by OLS.

total debt to the market value of the firm’s equity—denoted by [D/E]it —captures the strength
of the firm’s balance sheet. By including both equity volatility and debt-to-equity ratio in the
specification, we are implicitly capturing the notion of the “distance-to-default,” which, according
to Merton (1974), should be a sufficient statistic for default. The vector Xit [k], by contrast, controls
for the (pre-determined) bond-specific characteristics that could influence credit spreads through
either liquidity or term premiums, including the bond’s duration, the par amount outstanding,
the bond’s age, the bond’s (fixed) coupon rate, and an indicator variable for whether the bond is
callable.
Table 1 summarizes the estimation results. As shown in column 1, an increase in idiosyncratic
uncertainty leads to a significant widening of credit spreads—the elasticity estimate of 0.730 implies
that an increase in volatility of 10 percentage points (a move of a bit less than one standard
deviation) is associated with an immediate jump in credit spreads of about 50 basis points. The
coefficients on the remaining key variables are also economically and statistically highly significant
and have their expected signs: Strong profitability performance, as evidenced by a high realized
return on equity or an increase in the ratio of operating income to assets, is associated with a
narrowing of credit spreads, whereas an increase in leverage leads to a rise in credit spreads.
The inclusion of bond-specific credit rating fixed effects (column 2) substantially improves the fit
of the regression—evidently ratings contain important additional information about the borrowers’

6

credit quality—though it noticeably lowers the coefficient on uncertainty. Nevertheless, the effect
remains economically and statistically highly significant, with a 10 percentage point increase in
idiosyncratic volatility implying a widening of credit spreads of about 30 basis points. This estimate
is robust to the inclusion of industry fixed effects (column 3), which control for any systematic
differences in recovery rates across industries.
The specification in column 4 also controls for common macroeconomic shocks by adding a full
set of time dummies to the regression. Although the magnitude of the coefficient on uncertainty
shrinks further, the impact of uncertainty on credit spreads remains economically and statistically
important—an increase of 10 percentage points in idiosyncratic volatility is associated with a rise in
credit spreads of 15 basis points. In sum, these results strongly support the notion that fluctuations
in uncertainty affect financial conditions by significantly altering the level of credit spreads in the
economy.
We now turn to the main question posed by the paper: How does the interaction of uncertainty
and financial conditions affect investment dynamics? Following Leahy and Whited (1996) and
the more recent work of Bloom et al. (2007) and Panousi and Papanikolaou (2012), our empirical
approach involves regressing business fixed investment on the firm-specific measure of idiosyncratic
volatility, while controlling for the fundamental determinants of investment spending. In contrast
to the earlier research, our regressions also include credit spreads at the level of an individual firm,
which allows us to parse out the effect of uncertainty on investment conditional on this important
financial indicator.
Specifically, we consider the following empirical investment equation:
log[I/K]it = β1 log σit + β2 log sit + θ log Zit + ηi + λt + ǫit ,

(4)

where [I/K]it denotes the investment rate of firm i in period t; σit is our measure of idiosyncratic
uncertainty; sit is the credit spread on the portfolio of bonds issued by firm i; and Zit is a proxy for
the marginal product of capital, a variable that measures firm i’s future investment opportunities.8
In addition to uncertainty, credit spreads, and investment fundamentals, equation (4) includes a firm
fixed effect ηi and a time fixed effect λt —the former controls for systematic differences in the average
investment rate across firms, while the latter captures a common investment component reflecting
macroeconomic factors, which can influence firm-level investment through movements in output
or interest rates. The investment fundamentals Zit are measured using either the current salesto-capital ratio [Y /K]it or the current operating-income-to-capital ratio [Π/K]it , two widely used
proxies for the marginal product of capital (see Gilchrist and Himmelberg, 1998).9 As an alternative
8

The log-log nature of specification (4) reflects the fact that the firm-level investment rates, uncertainty, and
credit spreads are highly positively skewed, a feature of the data that is significantly ameliorated through the use of a
logarithmic transformation. Section A.2 of the data appendix contains details regarding the construction of variables
used in this exercise.
9
Taking logs of [Y /K]it is straightforward; but because operating income may be negative, we use log(c+[Π/K]it )—
where c is chosen so that (c + [Π/K]it ) > 0 for all i and t—when relying on the operating income to measure the
firm’s investment opportunities. In principle, the estimated elasticities may depend on the constant c. In practice,
however, reasonable variation in c had no effect on the estimated elasticities.

Note: Sample period: 1973:M1–2012:M9 at an annual frequency; No. of firms = 772; Obs. = 8,557. The dependent
variable in all specifications is log[I/K]it , the logarithm of investment rate of firm i in year t. All specifications include
time fixed effects (not reported) and firm fixed effects, which are eliminated using the within transformation, with the
resulting specification estimated by OLS. Robust asymptotic standard errors reported in parentheses are clustered at
the firm level. Parameter estimates for log[Π/K]it and the associated standard errors are adjusted for the fact that
log[Π/K]it is computed as log(0.5 + [Π/K]it ).

forward-looking measure of investment fundamentals, we also consider Tobin’s Q, denoted by Qit .
The result in columns 1–3 of Table 2 indicate a significant role for uncertainty in the capital
accumulation process—the coefficient on uncertainty is statistically highly significant, regardless of
the measure of investment fundamentals. The estimated elasticities lie in the range between −0.17
and −0.08, indicating that an increase in idiosyncratic volatility of 10 percentage points is associated with a decline in the investment rate of 0.5 to 1.1 percentage points. However, once the
credit spreads are added to the regression (columns 4–6), the marginal effect of uncertainty on
investment is virtually eliminated. Credit spreads, in contrast, are statistically and economically
highly important determinants of investment spending, with a 100 basis point rise in credit spreads
implying a drop in the investment rate of 1.4 to 1.9 percentage points.
A well-documented result from the empirical investment literature is the fact that lagged
investment rate is economically an important determinant of current investment spending (see
Gilchrist and Himmelberg, 1995; Eberly et al., 2012). Accordingly, we also consider a dynamic
specification of the form:
log[I/K]it = β1 log σit + β2 log sit + θ1 log Zit + θ2 log[I/K]i,t−1 + ηi + λt + ǫit .

(5)

In this case, we eliminate firm fixed effects using the forward orthogonal deviations transformation of Arellano and Bover (1995) and estimate the resulting specification using GMM. Within
this dynamic framework, both uncertainty and credit spreads are treated as endogenous and are

Note: Sample period: 1973:M1–2012:M9 at an annual frequency; No. of firms = 758; Obs. = 6,615. The dependent
variable in all specifications is log[I/K]it , the logarithm of investment rate of firm i in year t. All specifications
include time fixed effects (not reported) and firm fixed effects, which are eliminated using the forward orthogonal
deviations transformation. The resulting specification is estimated by GMM using a one-step weighting matrix (see
Arellano and Bover, 1995). Robust asymptotic standard errors reported in parentheses are clustered at the firm level.
Parameter estimates for log[Π/K]it and the associated standard errors are adjusted for the fact that log[Π/K]it is
computed as log(0.5 + [Π/K]it ).

instrumented with their own lagged values.
As shown in columns 1–3 of Table 3, fluctuations in uncertainty have economically large and
statistically significant effects on capital spending. Taking into account the lagged investment
dynamics (i.e., the L-R effects), the estimated elasticities imply that an increase in volatility of
10 percentage points depresses the investment rate 2.7 to 4.0 percentage points in the long run.
However, the adverse effect of increased uncertainty on investment spending is more than halved
once the information content of credit spreads is taken into account—estimates of the long-run
elasticities in columns 4–6 imply that the same-sized increase in volatility lowers the investment
rate only 1.1 to 1.8 percentage points. In contrast, a jump of 100 basis points in credit spreads
is estimated to shave off 1.4 to 2.1 percentage points from the rate of capital formation in the
long run. The confluence of results reported in Tables 1–3 is thus consistent with the notion that
changes in credit spreads are an important part of the mechanism through which fluctuations in
idiosyncratic volatility influence investment dynamics.

Macroeconomic Implications

To examine the aggregate implications of the dynamic interaction between uncertainty and financial
conditions, we use a SVAR model to trace out the impact of volatility and financial shocks on the
macroeconomy. We construct an aggregate proxy for idiosyncratic uncertainty by assuming the
firm-specific measure of uncertainty σit follows an autoregressive process of the form:
log σit = γi + δi t + ρ log σi,t−1 + vt + ǫit ,

(6)

where γi denotes a firm fixed effect intended to control for the cross-sectional heterogeneity in σit ,
while the firm-specific term δi t captures secular trends in the idiosyncratic risk of publicly traded
U.S. nonfinancial firms documented by Campbell et al. (2001).
At the aggregate level, our uncertainty proxy corresponds to the sequence of estimated time
fixed effects v̂t , t = 1, . . . , T , which captures shocks to idiosyncratic volatility that are common
to all firms. The presence of this common variation is essential because if fluctuations in σit were
themselves entirely idiosyncratic, the macroeconomic impact of uncertainty shocks should wash out
in the aggregate.10 The solid line in Figure 1 shows our estimate of time-varying uncertainty derived
10

We estimate equation (6) by OLS, using the entire panel of 11,303 firms over the 1963:Q3–2012:Q3 period. Because
the average firm is in the panel for more than 60 quarters, the bias of the OLS estimator, owing to the presence of

10

from the estimated time fixed effects in equation (6). The dotted line is the spread between the 10year yield on BBB-rated nonfinancial corporate bonds and the 10-year Treasury yield, a barometer
of strains in financial markets. Both uncertainty and credit spreads are clearly countercyclical,
typically increasing significantly before and during recessions and spiking in periods of widespread
financial distress.
Nevertheless, there are also clear exceptions to this pattern, the most obvious one being the end
of 1987, a period marked by a surge in idiosyncratic volatility due to the stock market crash early
in the fourth quarter that, interestingly, did not elicit a concomitant increase in credit spreads.
The fact that this surge in volatility had essentially no effect on the real economy provides prima
facie evidence for our hypothesis that changes in financial conditions are an important part of the
mechanism through which fluctuations in uncertainty affect the economy.
To quantify the effect of uncertainty and financial shocks on economic activity, we estimate a
VAR consisting of the following eight endogenous variables: the log of real business fixed investment
(it ); the log of real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) on durable goods (cD
t ); the log
of real PCE on nondurable goods and services (cN
t ); the log of real GDP (yt ); the log of the
GDP price deflator (pt ); the nominal effective federal funds rate (mt )—an indicator of the stance
of monetary policy; the 10-year BBB-Treasury credit spread (st ); and a proxy for idiosyncratic
uncertainty at the aggregate level (v̂t ).11 To identify uncertainty shocks, we employ a standard
recursive ordering technique, in which innovations in uncertainty have an immediate impact on
credit spreads and short-term interest rates, but they affect economic activity and prices with a lag
(Identification Scheme I).12 As a point of comparison, we rely on the same recursive ordering to
examine the impact of shocks to credit spreads—that is, “financial shocks”—that are orthogonal
to the contemporaneous level uncertainty and other macroeconomic variables. We also consider
a specification that reverses this causal ordering, which allows us to examine the implications of
uncertainty shocks conditional on the information contained in the current level of credit spreads
(Identification Scheme II).
Panel (a) in Figure 2 shows the impulse responses of selected variables to an uncertainty shock,
while Panel (b) shows the responses of the same variables to a financial shock, where both shocks
are orthogonalized using the first identification scheme. Given these identifying assumptions, an
unanticipated increase in volatility is associated with an immediate widening of credit spreads—in
fact, the magnitude of the response of credit spreads upon impact is remarkably consistent with
the micro-level estimates shown in column 4 of Table 1. The uncertainty shock also has significant
a lagged dependent variable, firm fixed effects, and incidental trends is likely to be negligible (see Phillips and Sul,
2007). The estimation yields an estimate of ρ = 0.443, an indication that uncertainty tends to be fairly persistent.
The specification also fits the data quite well, explaining more than 75 percent of the variation in the dependent
variable.
11
The VAR is estimated over the 1963:Q3–2012:Q3 period using four lags of each endogenous variable. The very
end of the sample (2009:Q1–2012:Q3) includes a period during which the federal funds rate has been very close to
zero. However, omitting the zero-rate policy phase from the sample had no discernible effect on the VAR results
reported in the paper.
12
Variants of this approach can be found in Popescu and Smets (2010), Bekaert et al. (2013), Bachmann et al.
(2013b), Caldara et al. (2013), and Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2014)

adverse consequences for economic growth, as evidenced by the almost immediate decline in output,
which bottoms out about a year after the initial spike in volatility.
Consistent with the standard irreversibility argument, the impact of the uncertainty shock falls
primarily on the investment component of aggregate spending: Business expenditures on fixed
capital fall steadily, bottoming out 1.5 percent below the trend six quarters after the shock, while
consumer spending on durable goods also declines significantly. As shown in Panel (b), a financial
disturbance, which leads to an increase of almost 30 basis points in the BBB-Treasury spread,
is also associated with a significant contraction in economic activity. In addition to depressing
the investment component of aggregate output, this shock also induces a significant decline in
nondurable goods consumption. Innovations in credit spreads, however, have an economically
negligible and statistically insignificant effect on the level of uncertainty in the economy.
Figure 3 shows the implications of these two shocks orthogonalized using an alternative scheme,
in which credit spreads are ordered before the uncertainty proxy. As shown in Panel (a), a volatility
shock in that case has a noticeably less adverse effect on the macroeconomy. Although both
business fixed investment and consumer spending on durable goods fall in response to an increase
in uncertainty, the declines are much smaller and less persistent compared with those in Panel (a)
of Figure 2; in fact, the response of output to an uncertainty shock is statistically indistinguishable
from zero.
Unanticipated increases in credit spreads, in contrast, have significant and long-lasting effects
on economic activity, according to Panel (b). A one standard deviation shock to the BBB-Treasury
spread is associated with an immediate jump in uncertainty, a substantial fall in real GDP, and a
protracted decline in business fixed investment as well as in major categories of consumer spending.
Indeed, the magnitude and shape of the responses of output and its major components to credit
spread shocks are very similar to those shown in the corresponding panel of Figure 2, indicating
that the level of uncertainty in the economy is not very informative for gauging the macroeconomic
impact of financial disturbances. The fact that uncertainty responds immediately to the innovation
in credit spreads suggests that fluctuations in uncertainty may arise endogenously in response to
changes in broader financial conditions (see Caldara et al., 2013).
All told, the evidence presented above shows that an unanticipated increase in uncertainty leads
to an economically and statistically significant widening of credit spreads and a drop in real GDP,
where the latter is driven by a protracted decline in the major investment categories of aggregate
spending. The VAR analysis is also consistent with our micro-level results, corroborating the fact
that changes in financial conditions—as summarized by the movements in credit spreads—appear
to be a crucial part of the transmission mechanism propagating uncertainty shocks to the real
economy. Indeed, our results indicate that once such disturbances are orthogonalized with respect
to the contemporaneous level of credit spreads, the impact of uncertainty shocks on economic
activity is significantly attenuated.

14

3

Model

The key agents in our model are heterogeneous firms facing time-varying idiosyncratic uncertainty,
nonconvex capital adjustment frictions—including partial irreversibility and fixed costs—and distortions in both the debt and equity markets. Within this framework, we focus on two nontraditional
sources of business cycle fluctuations: Disturbances from the first source affect the volatility of the
idiosyncratic technology process, whereas those from the second directly reduce the collateral value
of the firms’ capital assets and thus impinge on their borrowing capacity.
In the model, disturbances that alter the dispersion of the idiosyncratic technology shock affect
all firms and hence capture “uncertainty” shocks in the aggregate sense. And unlike the “capital
efficiency” shocks of Gertler and Karadi (2011), which, in effect, destroy the physical quantity of
capital in the economy, “capital liquidity” shocks in our model only affect the resale value of capital
assets that can be pledged as collateral. In the presence of irreversibilities and nonconvex capital
adjustment costs, uncertainty and capital liquidity shocks have real consequences for macroeconomic outcomes regardless of the structure of financial markets. Distortions in financial markets,
however, induce a change in the effective supply of credit in response to both types of disturbances,
an effect that significantly amplifies the initial impact of each shock on aggregate investment.

3.1

Production

The production side of the economy contains a continuum of heterogeneous firms that produce
goods used for consumption and investment. Firms producing the final good (y) combine labor (h)
and capital (k) using a decreasing returns-to-scale (DRS) production technology. The production
is subject to aggregate and idiosyncratic technology shocks, denoted by a and z, respectively. It
also requires a payment of fixed operating costs that are proportional to firm size as measured by
its existing capital stock, with the proportionality factor denoted by Fo > 0.
Formally, these assumptions are summarized by a production function
y = (az)(1−α)χ (k α h1−α )χ − Fo k;

0 < α < 1 and χ < 1,

(7)

where α is the value-added share of capital, and χ governs the degree of decreasing returns in
production. The normalization factor (1 − α)χ associated with the exogenous technology shocks
ensures that the firm’s profit function is linear in a and z:
π(a, z, w, k) = max
h≥0



(az)(1−α)χ (k α h1−α )χ − Fo k − wh = azψ(w)k γ − Fo k,

where w denotes the (real) wage and



The combination of decreasing returns-to-scale and fixed operating costs implies that the firm
15

can earn strictly positive (or negative) profits in equilibrium. In principle, this can generate nontrivial firm dynamics through entry and exit. To keep the model tractable, however, we do not
explicitly model the firm’s endogenous entry/exit decision. As in Cooley and Quadrini (2001) and
Veracierto (2002), we assume that a constant fraction 1 − η of firms exogenously exits the industry
in each period and that the exiting firms are replaced by identical new firms within the same period.
This stochastic overlapping generation structure provides a convenient way to motivate the use of
leverage by firms in the steady state without introducing a corporate income tax shield.
The process governing the evolution of the aggregate technology shock a is standard, as we
assume that it follows a continuous Markov process:
log a′ = ρa log a + log ǫ′a ;

log ǫ′a ∼ N (−0.5ωa2 , ωa2 ).

(9)

The idiosyncratic technology shock z, by contrast, evolves according to an N -state Markov chain
with time-varying volatility. We let i, j = 1, . . . , N index the technology states and let pi,j denote
the transition probability of moving from state i in the current period to state j in the subsequent
period. Importantly, the Markov chain of the idiosyncratic technology shock is constructed in
such a way that its conditional mean is not affected by fluctuations in volatility.13 Its conditional
variance, however, is a linear function of the realization of the time-varying volatility process, which
is given by a continuous Markov process of the form
log σ ′ = (1 − ρσ ) log σ̄ + ρσ σ + log ǫ′σ ;

3.2

log ǫ′σ ∼ N (−0.5ωσ2 , ωσ2 ).

(10)

Capital Accumulation

Firms accumulate capital subject to two types of adjustment frictions: fixed costs and partial
irreversibility. Formally, the total cost of capital adjustment is given by


g(k ′ , k) = Fk k + p+ × 1[k ′ ≥ (1 − δ)k] + p− × 1[k ′ < (1 − δ)k] k ′ − (1 − δ)k ,

(11)

where 1[·] is an indicator function and 0 < δ < 1 denotes the depreciation rate. The term Fk k represents the fixed costs associated with capital expenditures, which are assumed to be proportional
to the size of a firm.14
As emphasized by Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006), the fixed costs capture the inherent indivis13

See Section B.1 of the model appendix for technical details. It is worth noting that in our framework, the number
of the states of the Markov chain is constant over time. However, because the volatility of the chain is time varying,
the nodes in the support of the distribution of the idiosyncratic technology shock change in such a way that firms face
a greater dispersion of idiosyncratic technology levels when volatility increases. Hence, the index j in the expression
zj (σz ) signifies only the relative position—and not the absolute value—in the support of the realized distribution of z
that is associated with the volatility level σz .
14
Note that g((1 − δ)k, k) = Fk k, even when gross investment is equal to zero. This specification of capital
adjustment costs, however, does not imply that the firm pays the fixed costs Fk k in every period—that is, irrespective
of its investment action/inaction status. As discussed below, the capital adjustment costs g(k′ , k) enter the firm’s
problem multiplied by a decision variable ν ∈ {0, 1}, and when the firm finds it optimal to set ν = 0, it avoids paying
the fixed costs of adjustment (see Abel and Eberly, 1994).

16

ibility of physical capital and potential increasing returns to both the installation of new capital
and restructuring of productive capacity during periods of intensive investment. The second term
in equation (11) corresponds to the costly reversible investment framework of Abel and Eberly
(1996), whereby the liquidation value of installed capital p− is a fraction of its purchase price p+ .
The assumption that p− /p+ < 1 captures the notion of asset specificity and implies that capital in
place is less liquid than new capital. To explore the implications of time-varying liquidity of capital
assets, we let p− follow a continuous Markov process:
log p−′ = (1 − ρp− ) log p̃− + ρp− log p− + ǫ′p− ;

log ǫ′p− ∼ N (−0.5ωp2− , ωp2− ),

(12)

where ǫ′p− denotes a capital liquidity shock that through its effect on the resale value of capital
assets affects the amount of pledgeable collateral in the economy.

3.3

The Firm’s Problem

At the beginning of each period, all economic agents observe the realization of the idiosyncratic and
aggregate productivity shocks (z and a, respectively). The agents’ information set also includes
the level of idiosyncratic uncertainty (σ) and the liquidation value of capital (p− ). The timing
assumptions are such that this period’s volatility level σ determines the distribution of z ′ (σ) in
the subsequent period, where our notation makes explicit the dependence of the distribution of z ′
on the realized level of uncertainty. Thus, from a perspective of agents in the model, an increase
in σ today represents “news” regarding the distribution of profits tomorrow. To streamline the
notation, we define the aggregate state of the economy as a vector s = [a, σ, p− , µ], where µ denotes
the joint distribution of the idiosyncratic technology, capital, and net liquid asset positions (to be
defined below) across heterogeneous firms.
3.3.1

Financing Investment

To finance investment projects, firms use a combination of internal and external funds, where the
sources of external funds are debt and equity. Relative to internal funds, external funds command
a premium, either because of the direct cost of issuing equity, or in the case of debt, because of the
agency costs associated with default.
Bond finance:

Debt finance available to the firm consists of one-period, zero-coupon bonds.15

The debt contract specifies the par value of the issue b′ and the price q B , yielding the total amount
of debt financing equal to q B b′ in each period. By combining the proceeds from bond issuance
with other sources of funds, the firm purchases capital to be used in production. In the subsequent
period—after observing the realization of shocks—the firm decides whether to fulfill its debt obligation. If the firm decides not to default, it pays the face value of the debt b′ to the lender and
15

Given the preponderance of callable corporate debt in the United States (see Faust et al., 2013), this assumption
is not as restrictive as it may seem at first glance.

17

makes its production and financial decisions for the next period. If the firm chooses to default,
however, it enters a debt-renegotiation process with bond investors.
The renegotiation process is conducted under limited liability by assuming that there exists a
lower bound to the net worth of the firm—denoted by n̄—below which the firm cannot promise to
pay back any outstanding liability.16 The realized net worth next period is defined as the sum of
net profits and the market value of undepreciated capital, less the face value of debt:
n′ = a′ zj′ (σ)ψ(w(s′ ))k ′γ − Fo k ′ + p−′ (1 − δ)k ′ − b′ .

(13)

Note that the value of capital in place is evaluated at the resale value p−′ , rather than its book
value p+ . By combining the expression for net worth with the default condition n′ ≤ n̄, we can
define a level of idiosyncratic technology that triggers default—denoted by z D —conditional on the

z D (k ′ , b′ ; s′ ) ≡

n̄ + b′ + Fo k ′ − p−′ (1 − δ)k ′
.
a′ ψ(w(s′ ))k ′γ

(14)

Under limited liability, the new level of debt renegotiated by the firm and bond investors—
denoted by bR —cannot exceed the amount of debt b̄(k ′ , zj′ (σ); s′ ) that is consistent with the assumed
lower bound on net worth:
bR ≤ b̄(k ′ , zj′ (σ); s′ ) ≡ a′ zj′ (σ)ψ(w(s′ ))k ′γ − Fo k ′ + p−′ (1 − δ)k ′ .

(15)

We assume that the firm does not have any bargaining power during the renegotiation process. This
assumption implies that the renegotiated debt is determined by the upper bound on the amount
of debt that bond investors can recover in the case of default—that is, bR = b̄(k ′ , zj′ (σ); s′ ).
The default entails a dead-weight loss, captured by bankruptcy costs that are assumed to be
proportional to the amount of liquidated capital. As in Townsend (1979), the bankruptcy costs
reflect a loss of resources expanded by creditors to prevent managers of a defaulting firm from
behaving opportunistically. Thus the actual recovery in the case of default is given by bR −ξ(1−δ)k ′ ,
where the parameter 0 < ξ < 1 governs the magnitude of the bankruptcy costs and hence the degree
of frictions in the corporate bond market. Therefore, the recovery rate 0 ≤ R < 1 in the case of
default is given by

This type of contract is similar to that used by Cooley and Quadrini (2001) and Hennessy and Whited (2007).
In our setup, however, default occurs when the net worth of the firm n hits the lower bound n̄, whereas in the
aforementioned papers, a firm defaults when the value of its equity v hits the lower bound v̄. If the technology shock
follows an i.i.d. process and the analysis is conducted in partial equilibrium, the two assumptions are equivalent.
However, if the technology shock is persistent or the firm’s value function has other arguments (e.g., aggregate state
variables), the two assumptions are no longer equivalent. The decision to use a lower bound for the net worth to
determine the default threshold is a simplifying assumption that allows us to avoid the computationally intensive
task of inverting the value function to compute the default boundary in each iteration of the dynamic programming
routine, which is very costly in our general equilibrium framework. Moreover, it is not clear empirically whether firms
declare bankruptcy when the market value of their equity or net asset values becomes negative.

is the set of states of the idiosyncratic technology shock z, in which the firm will default on its debt
obligations.
Note that the exogenous exit rate 1 − η does not appear in the bond pricing formula (17). This
reflects the assumption that the exit shock is realized after the firms make their repayment/default
decisions. Consequently, the exit shock does not directly affect the returns of bond investors,
and credit spreads that arise in our framework are not a direct result of the exogenous exit risk.
However, the exit process does affect credit spreads indirectly by influencing the firms’ choice of
leverage.
Equity finance:

To introduce equity financing in the model, we start with the definition of

dividends:
d ≡ azi (σ−1 )ψ(w(s))k γ − Fo k − νg(k ′ , k) − b + qiB b′ + e,

(19)

where ν ∈ {0, 1} is the choice variable indicating whether the firm is in the investment inaction
(ν = 0) or action (ν = 1) regime, and e denotes the value of newly issued shares when positive
and the value of share repurchases when negative. Consistent with the prevalence of corporate
dividend-smoothing policies, we posit that the firms face a minimum dividend constraint,
d ≥ d¯ ≥ 0.

(20)

Thus, when the firm’s internal funds and the proceeds raised with the bond issue fall short of its
financing needs, the firm must raise outside equity (e > 0) to satisfy the dividend constraint.17
In the absence of financial distortions, the notional amount e of equity issuance reduces the
value of existing shares by the same amount. To introduce frictions in the stock market, we assume
that equity issuance is costly, in the sense that the value of existing shares is reduced by more than
the amount of newly issued shares. We capture this distortion by assuming a constant marginal cost
of equity issuance, commonly referred to as equity dilution costs in the corporate finance literature
17
As documented by Fama and French (2005), in an average year between 1973 and 2002, almost 60 percent of
dividend paying firms also issued new shares in the same year, on net, evidence that seems difficult to reconcile with
the assumption of frictionless financial markets. However, another possibility is that the lower bound on dividends
d in equation (20) is strictly positive for a fraction of firms that engage in dividend smoothing behavior for reasons
unrelated to financial market frictions (see Leary and Michaely, 2011). Indeed, this is the interpretation we adopt in
this paper.

19

(see Gomes, 2001; Cooley and Quadrini, 2001; Hennessy and Whited, 2007; Bolton et al., 2011).
Formally, the loss in the value of existing shares associated with the amount e of newly issued
equity is given by
ϕ̄(e) = e + ϕ max{e, 0},

(21)

where ϕ > 0 measures the degree of frictions in the stock market. Share repurchases (e < 0), in
contrast, are assumed equivalent to dividend payments and thus do not involve any dilution costs.
3.3.2

Financial Policy

To derive the optimal financial and investment policies, we formulate the firm’s profit maximization
problem recursively. By defining a composite state variable—the net liquid asset position (x)—as
x ≡ azi (σ−1 )ψ(w(s))k γ − Fo k − b = n − p− (1 − δ)k,

(22)

the firm’s dividend can be rewritten as d = x − νg(k ′ , k) + qiB b′ + e. This allows us to express the
value of equity as vi (k, x; s), where the subscript i denotes the firm’s relative position in the discrete
distribution of the idiosyncratic technology level z in the current period. In combination with the
realized level of volatility σ−1 , this relative position is the only information needed to predict the
subsequent values of the idiosyncratic technology shock.18
The firm’s problem can then be formulated recursively as
vi (k, x; s) = min

the law of motion governing the evolution of the aggregate state vector, which we describe below.
Note that the continuation value of the firm is bounded below by the default/renegotiation value
18

An equivalent way of formulating the problem would involve specifying the value of equity as vi,j (k, b; s), where i
denotes the firm’s relative position in the distribution of z in the previous period and j denotes the relative position
in the current period. In that case, we would need to keep track of both i and j because at any point in time, the
realization of the idiosyncratic technology shock depends on i, j, and σ−1 . Specifically, as shown in Section B.1 of
the model appendix, the realization of the Markov chain process with the time-varying volatility is given by

where µi is the conditional mean of z for a firm with the productivity level in the i-th bin in period t − 1. Hence i, j,
and σt−1 are needed to infer the exact value of the idiosyncratic technology shock in period t. However, as long as
the firm knows its net liquid asset position x, the exact value of the realization of the idiosyncratic shock is irrelevant
because only the current position in the distribution and the uncertainty level are needed to construct the conditional
expectation of the idiosyncratic technology shock next period.

The left side of equation (25) represents the marginal benefit of debt finance today, while the
expression on the right equals the expected marginal cost of such financing tomorrow, with the
ratio of the shadow value of internal funds tomorrow to that of today serving as the effective
discounting factor. By increasing its leverage, the firm improves its current cashflow but increases
the chance of a future liquidity shortfall, thereby raising the likelihood that it will have to issue
costly new shares in the future. Under limited liability, the firm cares about future cashflows only to
the extent that it avoids default, an aspect of the firm’s financial policy captured by the summation
over the states in the non-default set Dc .
3.3.3

Investment Policy

The presence of irreversibilities and nonconvex capital adjustment costs in the firm’s optimization
problem complicates the derivation of the conditions characterizing the firm’s optimal choice of capital. In this key dimension, however, our problem is similar to that analyzed by Abel and Eberly
(1994), who provide a unifying framework for deriving an optimal investment policy under a generalized capital adjustment cost function, encompassing both nonconvex and convex adjustment
costs as well as partial irreversibility.
To derive the conditions characterizing the firm’s optimal capital choice, we modify their approach to take into account the interaction between the firm’s financial and investment policies.
19
The summation over the states in Dc only reflects the fact that the effect of changes in b′ on the de′

denote the marginal value of an additional unit of capital—that is, the Tobin’s marginal q.20 For
the sake of argument, assume that the investment efficiency conditions can be obtained directly by
differentiating the Bellman equation (23) with respect to k ′ , thus ignoring any nondifferentiabilities.
In addition, assume that action is always optimal—that is, ν = 1. In that case, the first-order

In practice, however, the above condition may not lead to optimal investment because the firm
may find it in its interest to delay (dis)investment. To take into account this possibility, we define
the left- and right-hand side derivatives of the marginal q, evaluated at k ′ = (1 − δ)k, as
qiK− =

(30)

Equation (29) characterizes the firm’s optimal choice of capital assuming ν = 1, that is, investment action is always optimal. Intuitively, this first-order condition equates the marginal benefit
and cost of an additional unit of capital. In the presence of fixed costs, however, the investment
level that equalizes these two margins may not be unique. In that case, the optimal level of investment should not only be consistent with the marginal efficiency condition, but should also justify
the fixed costs associated with capital adjustment, an effect that expands the inaction interval

[qiK− , qiK+ .

20
Note that the marginal q is well defined despite the kinks in the firm’s value function due to default and nonconvexities in the capital adjustment process. This is because q is defined for the expected value of the firm, rather
than its realized value, and the kinks correspond to measure-zero events.

22

To provide sufficient conditions for the action/inaction decision (ν ∈ {0, 1}), we can reformulate
the firm’s problem (23) as a discrete choice problem:

vi (k, x; s) = max vi (k, x; s|ν = 1), vi (k, x; s|ν = 0) .

(31)

With this formulation, the sufficient condition for a strictly positive or negative gross investment is
then given by vi (k, x; s|ν = 1) − vi (k, x; s|ν = 0) > 0. Once this condition is met, the firm’s optimal
investment policy is fully characterized by equations (29) and (30).21
To highlight the role of financial distortion in the model, it is helpful to consider the case
of frictionless financial markets. Hence, the firm’s capital structure is indeterminate, and b′ =
0 without loss of generality; furthermore, the shadow value of internal funds—as measured by
the Lagrange multiplier on the dividend constraint—is always equal to one. Because the capital
adjustment costs do not include a convex cost component (hence, qiK− = p− and qiK+ = p+ ), the
firm’s target stock of capital k ′ satisfies the following conditions:22
p+ = qiK (k ′ ; s)

if qiK ((1 − δ)k; s) > p+ ;

k ′ = (1 − δ)k

if p− ≤ qiK ((1 − δ)k; s) ≤ p+ ;

p− = qiK (k ′ ; s)

if qiK ((1 − δ)k; s) < p− .

The intuition behind these conditions is straightforward. If the Tobin’s marginal q evaluated at
k ′ = (1 − δ)k is strictly greater than the purchase price of capital p+ , the firm should increase its
productive capacity until the marginal value of an additional unit capital is equal to its purchase
price. If, on the other hand, the marginal q evaluated at k ′ = (1 − δ)k is strictly less than the resale
price of capital p− , the firm should disinvest up to the point where the marginal value of capital
rises to the level of the resale price. If neither of these two conditions are met, the firm should do
nothing.
Financial frictions modify the above efficiency conditions in two ways. First, investment that
expands the firm’s productive capacity also increases its debt capacity, which lowers the firm’s
B
′ ′
′
marginal borrowing costs, an effect captured by the term qi,k
′ (k , b ; s)b > 0 in equation (29). In

turn, this reduces the effective marginal cost of investment today. Second, the combination of
a potential liquidity shortfall and the associated costly external equity issuance causes the firm
to discount the future (marginal) benefit of investment to a greater extent than in the case of a
frictionless stock market. The additional discounting factor is given by the inverse of the firm’s
liquidity condition—the term (1 + φ)−1 in equation (29)—which reflects the fact that from an
internal valuation perspective, a dollar within the firm is worth 1 + φ dollars. The firm’s liquidity
21

According to equations (29) and (30), the problem vi (k, x; s|ν = 1) does not preclude the optimality of k′ =
(1 − δ)k. However, the condition vi (k, x; s|ν = 1) − vi (k, x; s|ν = 0) > 0, by construction, ensures that positive or
negative gross investment is optimal. To see this, suppose that k′ = (1 − δ)k is optimal in the case of vi (k, x; s|ν = 1).
Then vi (k, x; s|ν = 1)−vi (k, x; s|ν = 0) > 0 cannot be satisfied because vi (k, x; s|ν = 1)−vi (k, x; s|ν = 0) = −Fk k < 0,
under the assumption that k′ = (1 − δ)k.
22
Note that in this case, the investment inaction interval is given by [p− , p+ ].

23

condition, therefore, necessitates a higher marginal return on investment, which boosts the required
return on equity and induces the firm to scale down its capital outlays.
Within our model, uncertainty and capital liquidity shocks cause fluctuations in aggregate
investment by perturbing the tradeoff between the beneficial effects of capital accumulation on the
firm’s ability to borrow and the increased risk of having to tap costly equity finance to maintain
its operations. The essential mechanism is that an increase in uncertainty or a decline in the resale
value of capital both damp down the positive effect of investment on the borrowing costs by making
corporate bond yields rise more sharply as firms scale up capital expenditures. In the standard
framework used to price risky debt, the payoff structure of levered equity resembles the payoff of a
call option, while the bondholders face a payoff structure that is equivalent to that of an investor
writing a put option. By Jensen’s inequality, therefore, an increase in payoff uncertainty benefits
equity holders at the expense of bondholders, prompting an adjustment in borrowing terms. If the
increase in borrowing costs required to leave the bond investors no worse off is greater than the
potential gain to the equity holders, an increase in uncertainty will lead to a decline in aggregate
investment. Similarly, a negative shock to the liquidation value of capital depresses aggregate
investment because a lower liquidation value directly reduces the debt capacity of firms and thus
increases the cost of capital for any given level of borrowing.

Market Clearing and Aggregation

(33)

The period-specific utility function u(c, h) is assumed to be strictly increasing and strictly concave
in consumption (c) and strictly decreasing and concave in hours worked (h). In fact, to maintain
tractability, we assume a very simple functional form, namely, u(c, h) = log c − ζh.
In the budget constraint (33), µ(z, k, x) denotes the joint distribution of the idiosyncratic technology, capital, and net liquid asset positions across heterogeneous firms. The realized gross re
turn on corporate bonds issued in the previous period is given by R̃B = 1 + 1[z ∈ D(k, b, z)] ×

[R(k, b, z(σ−1 )) − 1] b, while pS is the ex-dividend value of equity, p̃S is the current market value
of equity, and 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 is the fraction of outstanding shares owned by the household. The equity

valuation terms are linked by the accounting identity p̃S = pS − ϕ̄(e), where ϕ̄(e) ≥ e represents
the cost of issuing new shares. Note that the fixed costs of operation are rebated to the household
in a lump-sum fashion—hence these costs do not affect the economy-wide resource constraint.

where m(s, s′ ) = βuc (c′ , h′ )/uc (c, h) is the stochastic discount factor that also determines equilibrium bond prices, according to equation (17). The static optimization condition characterizing the
labor supply decision implies that w = −uh (c, h)/uc (c, h).

(36)

Note that implicit in the goods market clearing condition (36) is the assumption that the dilution
costs associated with seasoned equity issuance take the form of discount sales, implying that the
gains and losses of new and existing shareholders offset each other—as a result, the dilution costs
do not affect the aggregate resource constraint. The stock market clearing condition is simply
s′ = s = 1. The bond market then clears by Walras’ law.23
A key state variable of the model is µ(z, k, x), z ∈ Z ⊂ R, k ∈ K ⊂ R, and x ∈ X ⊂ R, the joint
distribution of the idiosyncratic technology shocks, capital, and net liquid asset positions across
heterogeneous firms. For any given aggregate state vector s′ , the law of motion for µ should satisfy

(37)

where Z ∈ Z , K ∈ K , X ∈ X , and Z , K , and X are the smallest σ-algebras generated by
the subsets of Z, K, and X, respectively. In equation (37), x̃i (k, x, zj′ (σ); s, s′ ) denotes the postrenegotiation value of net liquid asset holdings, which is given by
x̃i (k, x, zj′ (σ); s, s′ ) = a′ zj′ (σ)ψ(w(s′ ))ki′ (k, x; s′ )γ − Fo ki′ (k, x; s′ )

The dependence of µ′ on the next period’s state s′ , which itself contains µ′ as one of its elements,
reflects both the use of a composite state variable x in the firm’s planning problem and the debt
renegotiation process. Unlike the predetermined state variables such as capital stock, the firm’s
net liquid asset holdings and the post-renegotiation value of debt depend on the realization of all
exogenous and endogenous state variables at the aggregate level. As a result, the law of motion for
µ cannot be written in closed form, but rather corresponds to a fixed point problem that must be
23

Implicit in these aggregation conditions is also an assumption that firms that exit the market because of an
exogenous shock are replaced by entrants that inherit all the technical and financial characteristics of the exiting
firms.

solved by the agents in the economy.
Following the literature on computable general equilibrium with heterogeneous agents (see
Krusell and Smith, 1998; Khan and Thomas, 2008), we adopt the assumption of bounded
rationality—that is, the agents use only a finite number of moments of the joint distribution to
forecast equilibrium prices. Specifically, we assume that the agents use only the first moments
of log-linearized laws of motions to predict two prices: the marginal utility of the representative
household (uc (s)) and the real wage (w(s)). Because our specification for preferences of the representative household specifies an infinitely elastic labor supply, the equilibrium wage can be backed
out from the marginal utility of consumption. We also assume that the agents use only the first
moment of the distribution of capital (k̃) to gauge the productive capacity of the economy and
only the first moment of the distribution of the post-renegotiation value of debt (b̃) to infer the
indebtedness of the corporate sector.
Formally, the agents in the model use the following system of log-linear equations to forecast
equilibrium prices:

(38)

Consistency with the general equilibrium conditions requires that these perceived laws of motion
are accurate, in the sense that the forecast errors implied by the system (38) are arbitrarily small.
To achieve this consistency, we initialize Γ0 , Γ1 , and Γ2 with arbitrary values and then simulate
the model using Monte Carlo methods with randomly drawn aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks;
in the simulation, we let the agents learn from their errors and update the forecasting rules until
full convergence. An important aspect of this algorithm involves letting all markets clear, even
when the agents’ perceived laws of motion are “inaccurate,” that is, before full convergence (see
Section B.3 of the model appendix for details).

Calibration

For the most part, our calibration of the model relies on parameter values that are standard in the
literature. The time period in the model equals one quarter; accordingly, we set the household’s
rate of time preference β = 0.99, implying an annualized risk-free rate of 4 percent. We set α,
the value-added share of capital in the Cobb-Douglas production function, to 0.3. Together with
the estimation procedure described in Section A.4 of the data appendix, this implies an estimate
of decreasing returns to scale—the parameter χ—of about 0.85, a value within the range of values
used in the literature. The quarterly depreciation rate δ is set equal to 0.025. The quasi-fixed costs
of production Fo = 0.05, which implies that fixed costs equal about 10 percent of sales.24 With
24
According to Compustat data, the median ratio of sales, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses to sales
is about 20 percent. A portion of SG&A expenses is accounted for by investment in intangible capital such as R&D
and software expenditures, which is counted as investment by the BEA but is recorded as “expenses” in Compustat.
We assume that one-half of this ratio reflects fixed costs of production.

annualized percent) based on shocks to the profit function (see Section A.4 of the data appendix for details).
The dotted line depicts the spread between the 10-year yield on BBB-rated nonfinancial corporate bonds and
the 10-year Treasury yield. The shaded vertical bars denote the NBER-dated recessions.

these parameter choices, the model generates the ratio of dividends to net income of 50 percent,
roughly the same as the average of the (asset-weighted) median for corresponding ratio in the U.S.
nonfinancial corporate sector over the 1984–2012 period.
In the model, fluctuations in uncertainty, by changing the underlying distribution of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, have a direct effect on future profits. Accordingly, we use an uncertainty
proxy computed directly from the estimated shocks to the firms’ profit function to calibrate the
Markov chain for the idiosyncratic technology shock z and the process governing its stochastic
volatility (see Section A.4 of the data appendix for details). The solid line in Figure 4 depicts a
measure of idiosyncratic uncertainty based on profits, an empirical analogue of the time-varying
volatility of the idiosyncratic technology shock in our model. Note that like its counterpart derived
from equity prices, this uncertainty measure is highly countercyclical and comoves closely with
credit spreads (the dotted line).
In all model simulations, we assume four states for the idiosyncratic technology shock. The
resulting four nodes of z are functions of time-varying volatility, such that an increase in volatility
generates a greater dispersion in the nodes without changing the conditional expectation of the
idiosyncratic technology shock. We use the Markov-chain approximation method of Tauchen (1986)
and calibrate ρz , the persistence of the idiosyncratic technology process, to be 0.80, somewhat less
than that implied by the data (see Table A-4 in the data appendix).
27

The steady-state level of uncertainty σ̃z is set to 15 percent (30 percent annualized), which is
equal to the sample mean of the uncertainty measure shown in Figure 4. Using this proxy, we also
estimate an empirical counterpart to equation (10), which yields ρ̂σ = 0.75, with the 95-percent
confidence interval of [0.63, 0.87]; we set ρ̂σ = 0.90, a value at the high end of the estimated
range, but in line with the value used by Bloom (2009). To generate fluctuations in uncertainty in
the range between 20 and 40 percent (annualized)—a range consistent with the variability of our
uncertainty proxy over the 1976–2012 period—we set the standard deviation of uncertainty shocks
to 4 percent of the steady-state level of uncertainty (1.2 percent annualized).
Because we are not aware of any data source that tracks the resale value of fixed capital at the
macro level, we estimate an AR(1) specification for p− , using as a proxy the ratio of the price index
of used car sales relative to that of new car sales, two components of the monthly CPI published
by the BLS. This yields ρ̂p− = 0.97 and ω̂p− = 0.015, which are the values used in our calibration.
The liquidation value of capital in steady state p̃− is set equal to 0.5, which implies a steady-state
level for the book-value of leverage of one-half, the same as the average leverage calculated from
the Compustat data.25 With this calibration, an adverse liquidity shock of one standard deviation
reduces the resale value of capital about 3.5 percent. The purchase price of capital p+ is normalized
to one.
The fixed investment adjustment costs Fk = 0.01, a value estimated by Cooper and Haltiwanger
(2006). Following Prescott (1986), we set the persistence of the aggregate technology shock—the
parameter ρa in equation (9)—to 0.95; as is usual in the literature, the volatility of innovations of
the TFP process—the parameter ωa —is set to 0.0075 at the quarterly rate. The integration of all
exogenous AR(1) processes in the model is approximated by Gaussian quadratures.
Given the calibration of the processes for the idiosyncratic uncertainty and the liquidation value
of capital assets, we set the degree of frictions in the corporate bond market—the bankruptcy cost
parameter ξ—to generate an average credit spread of 160 basis points, which corresponds to the
median of the BBB-Treasury spread shown in Figure 1. Accordingly, we let ξ = 0.10, a value consistent with that used by Bernanke et al. (1999) and the micro-level evidence of Levin et al. (2004)
and one that implies a relatively modest degree of additional loss for the lender from bankruptcy.
Concerning the survival probability, we set η = 0.95, a value consistent with the survey of the
Business Employment Dynamics.
The estimates of the cost of seasoned equity issuance vary substantially in the literature, from
a low of 0.08 in Gomes (2001) to a high of 0.30 in Cooley and Quadrini (2001). We make a
conservative choice by letting ϕ = 0.12. Given this value, we choose the lower bound of dividends
d¯ such that 15 percent of firms, on average, issue new shares in each quarter, a proportion that is
roughly in line with that implied by the Compustat data. Finally, we set the lower bond on net
worth n̄ = 0. (Table B-1 of the model appendix summarizes the calibration of the model.)
25

The book value of leverage in the model corresponds to b/(π + p+ k). To calculate an empirical analogue using
quarterly Compustat data, we let b equal the book-value of total debt; π gross profits; and p+ k the book-value
of (gross) property, plant, and equipment. Over the 1976:Q1–2012:Q3 period, the average leverage in the U.S.
nonfinancial corporate sector was 0.49, according to this metric.

Capital Adjustment Dynamics

To illustrate the key aspects of the capital adjustment process, the top panel of Figure 5 displays
the contours of the firm’s investment policy function assuming partial irreversibility only, while the
policy function in the bottom panel also takes into account the fixed capital adjustment costs.26
Both policy functions feature (S, s)-type adjustment dynamics, where the “S”-shape includes two
distinct target capital levels: a lower level associated with the capital expansion problem and an
upper level associated with the capital contraction problem, which are separated by an investment
inaction region. The presence of financial market frictions implies that the (S, s) rule governing
investment spending also depends on the firm’s (net) liquid asset position.
Focusing first on Panel (a), a somewhat simpler case, consider a firm in a strong financial
position as reflected by a large value of x. In that case, the firm’s choice of capital tomorrow, as a
function of its current production capacity, is well described by the standard (S, s) rule with two
target stocks separated by the inaction region. The presence of financial distortion, however, induces
two distinct plateaus in both the capital expansion and contraction problems. The upward sloping
region between the two plateaus corresponds to the state space where the capital targets respond
positively to an improvement in the firms’ financial position. Holding the level of idiosyncratic
technology fixed, these regions are in fact characterized by a continuum of targets as summarized
by the firm’s overall position (x, k).
As shown in Panel (b), the introduction of fixed adjustment costs substantially expands the
investment inaction region. To economize on these costs, the firm allows its capital stock to
depreciate below the level that would, in the absence of fixed costs, trigger a positive investment
response; similarly, the firm is willing to tolerate a capital overhang before adjusting its productive
capacity. As a result, the adjustment of capital occurs in discrete jumps, which generates lumpy
investment dynamics.
The uneven topography of the policy function in the region associated with the capital expansion
problem provides a sense of how costly external finance complicates investment dynamics in that
case. Note also that financial conditions have less of an effect on the capital contraction problem.
In those states, the firm allows the capital overhang to persist longer, which implies that the
resulting reduction in production capacity leaves the firm with sufficient holdings of liquid assets,
so that its capital contraction target—and therefore disinvestment—is less sensitive to current
financial conditions. It is important to note that for illustrative purposes, we constructed the
policy functions in the above two examples over a wide range of capacity levels. In the actual
simulations of the model, however, the firms almost never reduce their productive capacity—other
than when defaulting—because even a small degree of irreversibility (20 percent in the above two
examples) makes the sale of installed capital almost always an unprofitable activity.
26
For illustrative purposes, we assume that the liquidation value of capital is 80 percent of the initial purchase price
in both examples, which is appreciably above the steady-state value of 50 percent used in our calibration. The fixed
investment costs Fk = 0.01, the value used in the calibration.

Macroeconomic Implications of Aggregate Shocks

In this section, we analyze the dynamics of the model’s key endogenous variables in response to three
aggregate shocks: an aggregate technology shock (a); a shock to the volatility of the idiosyncratic
technology shock (σz ); and a shock affecting the liquidation value of capital assets (p− ). The
benchmark model economy features a full set of financial distortions. To assess the quantitative

Note: The solid lines depict the impulse response functions of the model with financial frictions (w/ FF),
while the dashed lines are those of the model without financial frictions (w/o FF). In the experiment, a shock
increases aggregate TFP one standard deviation upon impact (period 5); aggregate TFP is then allowed to
revert back to its steady-state value following the process in equation (9). The impulse response functions
are averages of 50,000 simulations, where each simulation is an aggregation of the impulse responses of 10,000
firms (see Section B.3 of the model appendix).

role of these frictions, we also solve a version of the model without financial distortions. In that
case, the firms face the same irreversibility and nonconvex capital adjustment frictions as in the
benchmark case, except that investment is financed using only internal funds and equity, where the
issuance of the latter is not subject to any dilution costs.27
In computing the model-implied impulse response functions, we take into account the nonlinearities in the firms’ investment and financial policies that arise naturally in an economy with
irreversible investment, fixed capital adjustment costs, and financial distortions.28 As described
27
In that case, the stock of outstanding corporate debt is no longer an aggregate state variable, and the forecasting
rules in equation (38) are modified accordingly (see Section B.3 of the model appendix).
28
As shown in Table B-2 in Section B.3 of the model appendix, the linear laws of motion used by the agents to
forecast equilibrium prices are very accurate in a statistical sense. In other words, although the agents’ policy functions
are highly nonlinear at the micro level, the model’s key endogenous quantities exhibit fairly linear aggregate dynamics.
In fact, the existence of such “aggregation smoothing” is typically used to justify the use of an algorithm that uses
only a small number of moments to characterize the dynamics of the joint distribution µ (see Khan and Thomas,
2008). In principle, therefore, the response of key endogenous aggregate quantities to aggregate shocks could be
constructed using the estimated perceived laws of motion. While computationally straightforward, this approach is
limited in scope, however. For example, the response of the average credit spread—an object of great interest in our
analysis—cannot be constructed in such a linear fashion.

31

more fully in Section B.3 of the model appendix, the impulse response functions are based on the
following sequence of steps: (1) simulate the model twice—first with the idiosyncratic shocks only
and then with an aggregate shock layered on top of the same set of idiosyncratic shocks; (2) for
each simulation, aggregate the micro-level impulse responses of endogenous variables of interest;
and (3) take the difference between the two sets of aggregated endogenous quantities. To eliminate
any sampling bias that may have arisen when drawing idiosyncratic shocks, we repeat these three
steps a large number of times and then average the aggregate impulse response functions across
replications.
Figure 6 depicts the behavior of the model’s main endogenous variables in response to a positive
aggregate technology shock of one standard deviation. The comparison of the two sets of responses
reveals that financial distortions have a minimal effect on the magnitude and shape of the responses
of economic activity to the aggregate technology shock. In both model economies, the unanticipated
increase in aggregate TFP leads to a strong and persistent increase in consumption, investment,
and hours worked, dynamics similar to those implied by the canonical real business cycle (RBC)
model.
In both cases, the responses of key economic aggregates to the aggregate TFP shock are also
consistent with the work of Sim (2006) and Khan and Thomas (2008), who find that the presence
of irreversibilities and nonconvex adjustment frictions does not imply significant departures from
the dynamics of a standard RBC economy. A novel feature of our analysis is the fact that introducing financial distortions in the model also does not change this conclusion. As evidenced by the
responses of debt and capital, the technology-induced boom allows the firms to lever up, though
the resulting increase in the demand for credit significantly boosts the risk-free rate and credit
spreads. In turn, these changes in financial conditions restrain the expansion of corporate balance
sheets and damp the financial accelerator mechanism engendered by financial market frictions.
The top panel of Table 4 compares the business cycle moments of the two economies, conditional
on the aggregate technology shocks only. Consistent with the impulse response results, conditional
moments of the key endogenous quantities are very similar across the two model specifications.
Moreover, in spite of the presence of irreversibilities, nonconvex adjustment frictions, and financial distortions, the benchmark economy exhibits the hallmark features of an RBC model, with
the investment about three times more volatile than output and highly correlated with output,
consumption, and hours worked.
The macroeconomic impact of an uncertainty shock is shown in Figure 7. The comparison of
the investment response across the two models reveals a striking result: More than three-quarters
of the impact of the uncertainty shock on investment is due to financial distortions. This result is
also mirrored in the dynamics of output and hours worked, both of which exhibit a significantly
more muted response to an unanticipated surge in volatility in an economy with perfect financial
markets.
To understand how an increase in volatility interacts with the different frictions of the model, we
decompose the correlation between the firm-level capital adjustments and idiosyncratic uncertainty

Note: The solid lines depict the impulse response functions of the model with financial frictions (w/ FF),
while the dashed lines are those of the model without financial frictions (w/o FF). In the experiment, a shock
increases the volatility of the idiosyncratic technology shock (σ) 3 percentage points (annualized) upon impact
(period 5), a shock of 2.5 standard deviations; volatility is then allowed to revert back to its steady-state value
following the process in equation (10). The impulse response functions are averages of 50,000 simulations,
where each simulation is an aggregation of the impulse responses of 10,000 firms (see Section B.3 of the model
appendix).

into the adjustment at intensive and extensive margins. We measure the adjustment at the extensive
margin by calculating—for each period—the fraction of firms with positive investment expenditures
(Freq[I + ]). As another metric, we also consider “lumpy” investment, defined as a proportion
of firms with capital expenditures in excess of 10 percent of the book value of installed capital
(Freq[lumpy-I + ]). The intensive margin, by contrast, is defined as the average positive capital
expenditures (Avg[I + ]) in each period.29
According to the standard irreversibility theory, aggregate investment dynamics, especially in
response to fluctuations in uncertainty, will primarily reflect the firms’ adjustment at the extensive
margin—a jump in uncertainty raises the option value of waiting, which increases the proportion
of firms in the inactive region. As shown in the top panel of Table 5, this is indeed the case in the
model without financial frictions: The frequency of positive investment adjustments is negatively
29
In this experiment, the liquidation value of capital is fixed at its steady-state value of 0.5. With this calibration,
liquidating capital is almost never optimal, unless the realization of the idiosyncratic technology shock is unusually
bad and the firm has a significant capital overhang problem, a combination that generates large losses due to fixed
operating costs. As a result, disinvestment at the firm level plays a minor role in the determination of the dynamics
of aggregate investment, which allows us to focus on positive investment expenditures only.

correlated with the movements in uncertainty, implying that an increase in volatility pushes more
firms in the inaction region. The frequency of lumpy investment episodes is also negatively correlated with fluctuations in volatility. In contrast, the correlation between the average level of capital
expenditures and uncertainty is essentially zero, a result consistent with the conventional wisdom
that the response of aggregate investment to uncertainty shocks in a model with irreversibilities
and nonconvex adjustment frictions reflects primarily adjustment at the extensive margin.
These results change dramatically when the model includes financial distortions. In that case,
most of the adjustment in aggregate investment occurs at the intensive margin. The correlation of
almost −0.7 between the average size of capital expenditures and uncertainty implies that volatility
shocks lead to a large reduction in the target level of capital for active firms, rather than to a
reduction in the number of active firms. In fact, both the frequency of positive capital expenditures
and lumpy investments are positively correlated with fluctuations in uncertainty, a dynamic that
works against generating a large decline in aggregate investment.
As shown in Figure 7, these differences in aggregate investment dynamics are due entirely to
financial frictions. While the increase in uncertainty induces an appreciable decline in the risk-free
rate, this easing of financial conditions is more than offset by the sharp increase in credit spreads,
which jump about 90 basis points upon impact and remain elevated for a considerable period of
time. The resulting deterioration in borrowing terms implies a significant increase in the user cost
of capital, which leads firms to slash capital expenditures and delever, as evidenced by the response
of debt relative to that of capital stock. This interaction between the debt and capital overhang is
the key reason why most of the firm-level adjustment occurs at the intensive margin.
The impulse responses from the model with financial frictions are thus consistent with our em-

35

pirical evidence, which showed that fluctuations in uncertainty are associated with large swings in
credit spreads, which, in turn, are an important determinant of investment spending. We interpret the combination of our empirical evidence and model simulations as indicating that general
equilibrium models steeped in the Modigliani–Miller paradigm of frictionless financial markets are
likely missing a crucial part of the mechanism through which uncertainty shocks are propagated to
the real economy.
The middle panel of Table 4 summarizes the conditional business cycle moments of this experiment. The high relative volatility of investment suggests that fluctuations in uncertainty can
be an important driver of this cyclically-sensitive component of aggregate output. However, this
source of fluctuations generates a relatively modest degree of variability in aggregate output. In
both models, a substantial portion of the drop in investment in response to increased uncertainty is
offset by an increase in consumption, which attenuates output fluctuations. This negative comovement occurs because the uncertainty shock—unlike the aggregate TFP shock—does not directly
affect the resource constraint of the economy.30 As in Christiano et al. (2014), this counterfactual
conditional negative correlation between investment and consumption can easily be reversed by
introducing nominal price or wage rigidities in the model.
The dynamic behavior of the two economies when hit by an adverse capital liquidity shock is
shown in Figure 8. The differences in macroeconomic outcomes between the two models are again
striking. In the model without financial frictions, a drop in the liquidation value of capital has
essentially no effect on economic activity. The same shock, by contrast, induces a severe recession
in the economy with financial distortions. Business investment plunges more than 15 percent upon
the impact of the shock, and the hours worked decline sharply and remain below steady state for
a prolonged period of time. Even consumption—after the initial increase—declines noticeably and
stays subdued over the remainder of the response horizon. These dynamics translate into a decline
in aggregate output of more than 0.5 percent upon impact and ensure that the resulting recovery
is slow and protracted.
Financial frictions are again the key propagation mechanism of this shock, as the drop in
the liquidation value of capital assets immediately curtails the firms’ debt capacity and induces a
massive deleveraging of the corporate sector as well as a significant and persistent widening of credit
spreads. The acute debt overhang triggered by the capital liquidity shock implies a deterioration
in the overall business creditworthiness and leads to a drop in the risk-free rate. The decline in
the risk-free rate is of the same magnitude as the increase in credit spreads, which indicates that
fluctuations in the credit-risk component of corporate bond prices—as opposed to swings in riskfree base rates—are the source of the information content of the “bond market’s q” for business
fixed investment (see Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, 2007; Philippon, 2009).
The bottom panel of Table 5 shows the correlations of the different capital adjustment margins
30

As shown in an earlier version of this paper (available from the authors upon request), financial distortions—
in the absence of firm-level capital adjustment costs—cause procyclical capital reallocation. In turn, this generates
endogenous procyclical fluctuations in aggregate TFP. However, once we allow for firm-level investment irreversibility,
these reallocation-based TFP fluctuations become quantitatively negligible.

Note: The solid lines depict the impulse response functions of the model with financial frictions (w/ FF),
while the dashed lines are those of the model without financial frictions (w/o FF). In the experiment, a shock
reduces the liquidation value of the firms’ capital assets (p− ) 5 percent upon impact (period 5), a shock of
about 1.5 standard deviations; the liquidation value of capital is then allowed to revert back to its steadystate value following the process in equation (12). The impulse response functions are averages of 50,000
simulations, where each simulation is an aggregation of the impulse responses of 10,000 firms (see Section B.3
of the model appendix).

with the liquidation value of capital. Not surprisingly, these correlations are essentially zero in
the model with frictionless financial markets. However, when financial distortions are present, the
average (positive) capital outlay is strongly positively correlated with fluctuations in the resale value
of capital, reflecting the tight link between capital liquidity shocks and the firms’ debt capacity.
On the extensive margin, the correlation between the liquidation value of capital and the frequency
of positive investment expenditures is negative, whereas the correlation with lumpy investment
is positive. Evidently, an improvement in the liquidity of the secondary market for capital—an
improvement in the sense of higher resale value—makes the nonconvex capital adjustment costs
relatively more important for firms that are considering adjusting their production capacity; this
induces firms to economize on transaction costs arising from the fixed capital adjustment costs by
increasing the average size of investment expenditures and by more frequently making large capital
outlays.
As shown in the bottom panel of Table 4, such liquidity shocks have the potential of being
an important source of cyclical fluctuations in an economy with imperfect financial markets and
capital specificity. Recall that the (quarterly) standard deviation of capital liquidity shocks is only

Sample period: 1962:Q1–2012:Q3, unless noted otherwise. Variable definitions: S = 10-year BBBTreasury corporate bond spread; Y = nonfarm business sector output (c-w $2005); I = business investment
in equipment & software (c-w $2005); and STD(S) = cross-sectional standard deviation of credit spreads
(Sample period: 1973:Q1–2012:Q3; see Section A.1 of the data appendix for details). With the exception
of the credit spread (S) and the cross-sectional dispersion of credit spreads (STD(S)), actual data are
transformed into stationary series by log-differencing.

1.5 percent, a relatively modest amount of variability in light of, say, historical swings in the value
of commercial real estate. Nevertheless, this fairly small amount of volatility in the resale value of
capital generates economically realistic amounts of variability in the key endogenous aggregates:
The conditional standard deviation of aggregate output implied by the benchmark model closely
matches the volatility of U.S. real GDP, and the relative conditional volatilities of consumption and
hours worked are also close to their respective empirical counterparts; that said, the model does
generate business fixed investment that is too volatile relative to what is observed in the data.
The benchmark model also delivers more realistic comovements between main macroeconomic
quantities. The degree of comovement between investment and output is very close to that observed
in the data, while the correlation between consumption and output, though still a bit on the high
side, is much more reasonable. Importantly, shocks to the liquidation value of capital generate a
positive correlation between investment and consumption, though for the same reasons as discussed
above, the degree of comovement is still notably below that implied by the actual data.

5.3

Cyclical Properties of Credit Spreads

One of the defining feature of the U.S. business cycle is the strong negative correlation between economic activity and corporate bond credit spreads. Another notable, though less emphasized, feature
is the countercyclical behavior of the cross-sectional dispersion in credit spreads (see Gilchrist et al.,
2013). Table 6 compares the cyclical behavior of credit spreads—both their level and dispersion—
implied by our benchmark model with the U.S. data. Assuming that aggregate technology shocks
are the sole source of economic fluctuations (column 1) implies that both the average level of credit
spreads and their cross-sectional dispersion are strongly procyclical, results that run counter to the

38

data. The procyclical behavior of credit spreads in the model arises because a positive aggregate
TFP shock induces firms to lever up to take advantage of new profitable investment opportunities.
The increase in leverage, however, leads to deterioration in the firms’ creditworthiness and causes a
widening of credit spreads. An adverse technology shock induces a downward shift in the demand
for credit, which makes quantities and prices move in the same direction, thereby generating procyclical credit spreads. This counterfactual procyclicality of credit spreads in a technology-driven
business cycle is a general feature of general equilibrium models with costly external finance, a fact
pointed out by Gomes et al. (2003) in their critique of the financial accelerator mechanism.
When the business cycle is driven by either uncertainty or liquidity shocks (columns 2–3),
the level of credit spreads and their dispersion are strongly countercyclical, comovements strongly
supported by the data. These two types of economic disturbances share a common feature in that
they both impair the borrowers’ creditworthiness. In response, the supply curve of loanable funds
shifts inward, causing the quantity of credit and its price to move in the opposite direction, which
generates the countercyclical behavior in credit spreads.

Conclusion

This paper argues that financial distortions due to agency problems between financial market
participants are an important part of the transmission mechanism by which fluctuations in volatility
affect the economy. We explored the quantitative significance of this mechanism in the context of a
general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms facing time-varying idiosyncratic uncertainty,
partial investment irreversibility, fixed investment costs, and frictions in both the debt and equity
markets. As in the standard framework, investment irreversibilities cause firms to adopt a wait-andsee attitude in response to an increase in uncertainty. At the same time, the implied illiquidity of
capital assets reduces the firms’ debt capacity because in the case of costly default, the liquidation
of capital lowers the recovery value of corporate debt claims.
Model simulations indicate that financial frictions are a powerful conduit through which uncertainty shocks affect aggregate investment. A jump in uncertainty leads to a sharp and persistent
widening of credit spreads, which induces firms to simultaneously slash capital expenditures and
delever. This quantitatively important channel is absent in an economy without financial distortions, where the significantly more-attenuated response of investment to uncertainty shocks reflects
solely the aggregation of the standard wait-and-see decisions of individual firms. With partial irreversibility, an adverse shock to the resale value of capital—by reducing the collateral value of
assets— curtails the debt capacity of firms and creates a powerful interaction between the capital
and debt overhang problems. Model simulations indicate that such capital liquidity shocks can
be an important source of macroeconomic fluctuations. Importantly, the model-implied dynamics
are consistent with our empirical evidence, which shows that movements in corporate bond credit
spreads are economically and statistically an important part of the investment-uncertainty nexus.

Data Appendix

In this appendix, we describe the construction of firm-level credit spreads and other firm-specific
variables used in the empirical analysis. Subsection A.1 describes the bond-level data set used to
compute firm-specific credit spreads. Subsection A.2 provides the details surrounding the construction of variables used in the estimation of credit spread regressions, while subsection A.3 describes
the construction of the panel data set used to estimate the relationship between investment, uncertainty, and credit spreads. And lastly, subsection A.4 describes the estimation procedure—and the
associated results—used to estimate the degree of decreasing return-to-scale in U.S. nonfinancial
corporate sector, as well as to construct our proxy for idiosyncratic uncertainty based on firm-level
profitability shocks.

A.1

Bond-Level Data

For a sample of U.S. nonfinancial firms covered by the S&P’s Compustat and the Center for
Research in Security Prices (CRSP), we obtained month-end secondary market prices of their
outstanding securities from the Lehman/Warga and Merrill Lynch databases. As discussed by
Gilchrist et al. (2009), these two data sources include secondary market prices for a vast majority
of dollar-denominated bonds publicly issued in the U.S. corporate cash market. To ensure that we
are measuring borrowing costs of different firms at the same point in their capital structure, we
limited our sample to only senior unsecured issues with a fixed coupon schedule.
As emphasized by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012), using security-level data allows the construction of credit spreads that are not biased by the maturity/duration mismatch, a problem
that plagues credit spread indexes constructed with aggregated data. Specifically, we construct—
for each individual bond issue in our sample—a theoretical risk-free security that replicates exactly the promised cash-flows of the corresponding corporate debt instrument. For example, consider a corporate bond k issued by firm i that at time t is promising a sequence of cashflows
{C(s) : s = 1, 2, . . . , S}, which consists of the regular coupon payments and the repayment of the
principle at maturity. The price of this bond in period t is given by
Pit [k] =

S
X

C(s)D(ts ),

s=1

where D(t) = exp(−rt t) is the discount function in period t.
To calculate the price of a corresponding risk-free security—denoted by Ptf [k]—we discount the
promised cashflows {C(s) : s = 1, 2, . . . , S} using continuously-compounded zero-coupon Treasury
yields in period t, derived from the daily estimates of the U.S. Treasury yield curve estimated by
Gürkaynak et al. (2007). The resulting price Ptf [k] can then be used to calculate the yield—denoted
by ytf [k]—of a hypothetical Treasury security with identical cashflows as the underlying corporate
bond. Consequently, the credit spread Sit [k] = yit [k] − ytf [k], where yit [k] denotes the yield of
the corporate bond k, is thus free of the “duration mismatch” that occurs when the spreads are
computed simply by matching the corporate yield to the estimated yield of a zero-coupon Treasury
security of the same maturity.
To ensure that our results are not driven by a small number of extreme observations, we eliminated from our data set all observations with credit spreads below 5 basis points and greater
than 2,000 basis points. We also eliminated very small corporate issues (par value of less than
45

$1 million) and all observations with a remaining term-to-maturity of less than one year or more
than 30 years.31 These selection criteria yielded a sample of 6,725 individual securities over the
1973:M1–2012:M9 period. These corporate securities were then matched with their issuer’s quarterly income and balance sheet data from Compustat and daily data on equity valuations from
CRSP, a procedure that yielded a sample of 1,164 U.S. nonfinancial firms.

a
Market value of the outstanding issue deflated by the CPI (2005 = 100).

Table A-1 contains summary statistics for the key characteristics of bonds in our sample. Note
that a typical firm in our sample has a few senior unsecured issues outstanding at any point in
time—the median firm, for example, has three such issues trading in the secondary market in any
given month. This distribution, however, is skewed to the right and has a heavy right tail, as some
firms can have many more issues trading in the secondary market at a point in time. The size
distribution of these issues—as measured by their (real) market value—runs from $1.2 million to
more than $5.6 billion and has a very similar shape.
Given our focus on the corporate bond market, the maturity of these debt instruments is fairly
long—the average maturity at issue of almost 13 years. The average remaining term-to-maturity,
by contrast, is about 11 years. In terms of default risk—at least as measured by the S&P credit
ratings—our sample spans the entire spectrum of credit quality, from “single D” to “triple A.” At
“BBB1,” however, the median observation is still in the investment-grade category. Note that the
central tendencies of our sample—in both the maturity and credit-risk dimensions—closely match
those of the 10-year BBB-Treasury spread used in the VAR analysis. Lastly, an average bond has
an expected return of 202 basis points above the comparable risk-free rate, while the standard
deviation of 223 basis points is again indicative of the wide range of credit quality in the sample.
Figure A-1 depicts the time-series evolution of the selected moments of the cross-sectional distribution of credit spreads in our sample. As shown by the solid line, the median credit spread is
countercyclical and typically starts to increase before the official onset of recessions. Importantly,
the dispersion of credit spreads—as measured by the interquartile range—also tends to lead the
business cycle and increases markedly during periods of financial market distress, a pattern consistent with the well-documented countercyclical heterogeneity in firm stock returns, profits, and
productivity.
31

Calculating credit spreads for maturities of less than one year and more than 30 years would involve extrapolating
the Treasury yield curve beyond its support.

Credit Spread Regressions

While our micro-level data on credit spreads reflect month-end values, the requisite firm-level
income and balance sheet items from Compustat are available only quarterly; in addition, our
measure of firm-level uncertainty is estimated at a quarterly frequency. The time-series frequency
of the panel data set used in the estimation of our credit spread regressions is, therefore, quarterly.
In constructing the data set used to estimate the credit spread regressions reported in Table 1 in
Section 2.1, we also took into account the fact that the firms’ fiscal years end at different months
of the year. As a result, observations in the data set occur at different months of the year but are
spaced at regular quarterly (i.e., three-month) intervals.
Letting v# denote the quarterly Compustat data item number, the key explanatory variables
used in the credit spread regressions are defined as follows:
• σit : quarterly uncertainty proxy, constructed using daily idiosyncratic returns over the three
months of the firm’s fiscal quarter;
E
• Rit
: quarterly stock return, constructed from daily (total) log returns from the CRSP database
over the three months of the firm’s fiscal quarter;

• [Π/A]it : ratio of operating income to assets, defined as operating income before depreciation
and amortization (v21) in quarter t and scaled by total assets (v44) in quarter t − 1;
• [D/E]it : ratio of debt to equity, defined as the book value of debt in current liabilities (v45)
plus the book value of long-term debt (v51)—both in quarter t—and scaled by the market

Summary statistics of these key firm characteristics are summarized in Table A-2.

A.3

Investment Regressions

In constructing the data set used in the estimation of the investment regressions reported in Tables 2–3 in Section 2.1 of the paper, the Compustat data on capital expenditures are available only
at an annual frequency. In constructing this data set, we also take into account the fact that the
firms’ fiscal years end at different months of the year. As a result, observations in the data set
occur at different months of the year but are spaced at regular yearly (i.e., twelve-month) intervals.
Letting v# denote the annual Compustat data item number, the key variables used in the
investment regressions are defined as follows:
• [I/K]it : ratio of investment to capital, defined as capital expenditures (v128) in year t and
scaled by (net) property, plant, and equipment (v8) in year t − 1;
• σit : yearly uncertainty proxy, constructed using daily idiosyncratic returns over the twelve
months of the firm’s fiscal year;
• sit : yearly average portfolio credit spread, constructed using month-end credit spreads over
the twelve months of the firm’s fiscal year;32
• [Y /K]it : ratio of sales to capital, defined as (net) sales (v12) in year t and scaled by (net)
property, plant, and equipment (v8) in year t − 1;
• [Π/K]it : ratio of operating income to capital, defined as operating income before depreciation
and amortization (v178) in year t and scaled by (net) property, plant, and equipment (v8) in
year t − 1;
• Qit : Tobin’s Q, constructed as the book value of total liabilities (v181) plus the market value
of common equity from the CRSP database—both in year t—and scaled by the book value
of total assets (v6) in year t.

32
For the firms that have more than one bond issue trading in the secondary market in a given period, we calculate
the portfolio spread in that period by computing an average of credit spreads on all of the firm’s outstanding bonds.

key firm characteristics are summarized in Table A-3.

A.4

Uncertainty Proxy Based on Profit Shocks

In this section, we describe the procedure used to calibrate the curvature of the profit function and
the parameters governing the stochastic volatility process of the idiosyncratic technology shock.
Under the assumption of a Cobb-Douglas production function, gross profits (profits before fixed
operation costs) differ from sales only up to a constant. Hence, one can estimate the returns to
scale using data on either sales or gross profits. We chose sales in order to avoid the occasionally
negative gross profit observations.
Letting v# denote the quarterly data item number, we selected from the Compustat database
all U.S. nonfinancial firms with at least 20 quarters of non-missing data on net sales (v2) and net
property, plant, and equipment (v42) over the 1976:Q1–2012:Q3 period, a procedure yielding an
unbalanced panel of 9,411 firms for a total of 549,946 observations.33 To ensure that our results were
not driven by a small number of extreme observations, we dropped from the sample all observations
with the sales-to-capital ratio below 0.01 and above 20.0 and observations with quarterly growth
rates of sales and capital above and below 100 percent.
Our empirical counterpart of the profit function in equation (8) in Section 3.1 of the main text
is given by
log Yit = cit + γs log Ki,t−1 + λst + uit ,
(A-1)
where Yit denotes the sales of firm i in quarter t and Ki,t−1 is the capital stock at the end of
quarter t − 1. The regression disturbance term uit corresponds to the idiosyncratic technology
shock log zit in our model, while the coefficient γs determines—in conjunction with the relative
share of capital—the degree of decreasing returns to scale in production, according to
χs =

γs
.
α + (1 − α)γs

As indicated by the subscript s, we allow the curvature of the profit function to differ across
production sectors as defined by the 2/3-digit NAICS codes.
33

Prior to 1976, most firms in Compustat did not report their capital stock data on the quarterly basis.

49

Because quarterly firm-level sales are characterized by a strong seasonal pattern, we specify
that the firm-specific term cit in regression (A-1) satisfies:
cit =

4
X

φn × 1[QTRit = n],

n=1

where 1[QTRit = n] is an indicator function that equals one if firm i’s observation in period t falls
in quarter n and zero otherwise—that is, the regression includes a full set of firm-specific quarterly
dummies. And lastly, industry-specific (3-digit NAICS) time fixed effects—denoted by λst —are
included in the regression to control for the persistent nature of cyclical profitability shocks within
an industry (see McGahan and Porter, 1999).
We use the residuals from the estimation of equation (A-1) to calibrate the process for the
idiosyncratic technology shock. First, the persistence of the process is obtained by estimating the
following pooled OLS regression:
ûit = ρz ûi,t−1 + ǫit ,
(A-2)
Second, if the error term ǫit in regression (A-2) is distributed normally, then an unbiased estimator
of the true standard deviation of ǫit is given by
r
π
σ̂ǫ,it =
|ǫ̂it |,
2
which yields an estimate of the volatility of the idiosyncratic technology shock for each firm i in
every quarter t.34 To obtain a proxy for the time-varying uncertainty of productivity shocks, the
last step involves estimating a panel regression of the form:
log σ̂ǫ,it =

4
X

βk log σ̂ǫ,i,t−1 + ηi + vt + ζit ,

k=1

where ηi denotes a fixed firm effect. In keeping with our earlier approach, a measure of uncertainty
based on profit shocks shown in Figure 4 corresponds to the sequence of estimated time fixed effects
v̂t , t = 1, ..., T , which captures common fluctuations in the idiosyncratic uncertainty regarding the
profitability prospects in the nonfinancial corporate sector.35
The results of the first two steps of our estimation procedure are summarized in Table A-4.
According to the entries in the table, the sector-specific estimates of the curvature of the profit
function yield economically sensible degree of decreasing returns to scale in each broad production
sector of the U.S. nonfinancial corporate sector. The estimates of χ lie in a relatively narrow interval,
ranging from a low of about 0.81 in agriculture and arts, entertainment, and related services to a
high of 0.90 in the mining sector. The average estimate of the decreasing return to scale is about
0.85, which is the value used in our calibration. As indicated by the second memo item in the
table, our approach implies the persistence of the idiosyncratic technology shock, the coefficient ρz
in equation (A-2), to be about 0.90.

34

This approach is similar to that of Kim and Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez Quiros (2000), who estimate
the volatility of aggregate output growth in each quarter from a single observation.
35
To ease the interpretation, the sequence v̂t , t = 1, . . . , T , has been re-scaled and expressed in annualized percent.
In addition, the residual seasonality has been removed by using the X11 filter.

Model Appendix

In this appendix, we provide details regarding the key elements of our model and its solution
method. Section B.1 describes the construction of the Markov chain with time-varying volatility,
which governs the evolution of the idiosyncratic technology shock. Section B.2 summarizes the
calibration of the model, while Section B.3 elaborates on the computational details.

B.1

and let pi , i = 1, . . . , N , denote its ergodic distribution. We assume, without loss of generality, that
N is an even number. We also assume that the ergodic distribution is symmetric, in the sense that
pi = pN −(i−1) for all i = 1, . . . , N .
The N states of the chain are given by

Now consider the same discrete-time Markov chain, except suppose that its volatility follows a

Thus, the conditional mean of the modified Markov chain with stochastic volatility is identical to
that of the conventional Markov chain with time-invariant volatility (see equation B-3). Hence,
an increase in volatility represents a mean-preserving-spread (MPS) of z, a property reflecting the
presence of the mean-correction term −0.5µi (σt − σ̄) in equation (B-5).
In contrast, the conditional variance of the process is given by
E(zt+1 | zt = z) = z̄ +

Var(zt+1 | zt = zi, ) = σt2

Thus the conditional volatility of this process depends linearly on the realization of the stochastic
process {σt }. In this formulation, the support of the distribution of the idiosyncratic technology
shock z is evolving stochastically over time, with an increase in σ today inducing a greater dispersion
in z tomorrow and vice versa. Under the assumption of a symmetric ergodic distribution (pi =
pN −(i−1) , i = 1, . . . , N ), it is straightforward to show that the realization of the volatility process
{σt } does not alter the unconditional mean and variance of z.

Computational Details

The model is solved using the inner-and-outer-loop algorithm developed by Krusell and Smith
(1998). In the inner loop, the agents predict market-clearing prices using log-linear laws of motion
for the aggregate moments. Under this bounded rationality assumption, we solve the inner-loop
problem using a value function iteration routine, which allows for a fully nonlinear global solution
under several occasionally binding constraints; in our case, these constraints are associated with
54

the dividend constraint, partial irreversibility, and nonconvex capital adjustment costs. Once the
inner-loop problem is solved, we use Monte Carlo methods to simulate the model economy for
T = 2, 000 (quarters) and N = 10, 000 (firms).
The dimension of the inner-loop problem is quite large, compared with most models of this type.
As described in the main text, the set of states in our model is given by {z, k, x, a, p− , σ−1 , k̃, b̃}.
In the numerical implementation, we allow for 40 equispaced grid points for the endogenous state
variables k and x; for the decision variables k ′ and b′ , however, we use 200 equispaced grid points.
For the state variables that are exogenous from the perspective of the firms in the economy—that
is, {a, p− , σ−1 , k̃, b̃}—we use 3 grid points. For the exogenous aggregate state variables a, p− , and σ,
we use a Gauss-Hermite quadrature method, so that the value function and policy variables can be
computed for continuous variation in these state variables. We use two points for the Gauss-Hermite
quadrature integration for each shock associated with the exogenous aggregate state variables.
The continuation values off the grid points for {z, k, x, a, p− , σ−1 , k̃, b̃} then need to be evaluated
using a tensor product spline approximation. Because we specified a 4-state Markov Chain for the
idiosyncratic technology shock z, the dimension of the problem {z, k, x, a, p− , σ−1 , k̃, b̃, k ′ , b′ , z ′ , a′ , σ}
is given by 4 × 40 × 40 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 200 × 200 × 4 × 2 × 2 × 2 ≈ 1.99e + 12.
In the outer loop, we update the aggregate laws of motion using a Monte Carlo simulation.
At this stage, it is important to ensure that all markets clear, even when the perceived aggregate
laws of motion are “inaccurate.” To this end, we solve for the marginal utility of consumption
uc (st ) that is consistent with the market clearing conditions, using a nonlinear root finder for each
t = 1, . . . , T of the Monte Carlo simulation. This step substantially slows down computations in
the outer loop but allows for a maximum amount of learning by the agents in the economy. Once
the economy is simulated, we use OLS to update the aggregate laws of motion.
Within this framework, it is important to check how well does the aggregation methodology
used to compute the solution of the model approximate the model’s true rational expectations
equilibrium. The top panel of Table B-2 shows the estimates of the parameters governing the
aggregate laws of motion implied by the system of equations (38) that are used by the agents to
predict future prices in the model with financial frictions. As evidenced by the high R2 values, the
agents’ perceived aggregate laws of motion are highly accurate. According to this commonly used
metric, our solution of the model is thus likely a good approximation of the model’s true rational
expectations equilibrium.
The coefficients of the forecasting rules used by the agents to forecast equilibrium prices also have
a number of intuitive properties. For example, the negative coefficient on the stock of debt (b̃) in the
law of motion for the aggregate capital stock reflects the effect of debt overhang on macroeconomic
outcomes: All else equal, a high level of corporate debt implies less capital accumulation going
forward. In contrast, the aggregate debt stock has a positive effect on consumption, a result
reflecting the fact that outstanding corporate debt is a part of the representative household’s
wealth. However, the coefficient on the stock of debt (b̃) in the law of motion for consumption
is very small compared with that of the aggregate capital stock (k̃), which suggests that at the
general equilibrium level, the drag from the debt overhang in the corporate sector reduces the
marginal propensity to consume out of claims on corporate debt. As evidenced by the relatively
large positive coefficients on the liquidation value of capital (p− ) in the law of motion for both the
aggregate capital and debt stocks, capital liquidity shocks importantly influence the dynamics of
capital and debt accumulation in the model.
We also solved a version of the model without financial distortions–in that case, the firms
face the same capital adjustment frictions as before, except that they finance their investment
expenditures using only internal funds and equity, where the issuance of the latter is not subject
to any dilution costs. The bottom panel of Table B-2 shows the aggregate laws of motion for the

Note: Both simulations assume that there are 10,000 heterogeneous firms at any point in time and are simulated for
2,100 quarters by feeding into the specified model randomly drawn aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. In updating
the agents’ perceived aggregate laws of motion, the initial 100 quarters are dropped and the remaining observations
are used to estimate the aggregate laws of motion (all specifications include a constant, not reported). The updated
laws of motion are then used to update the individual policy rules in a numerical dynamic programming problem.
The algorithm stops when the changes in the aggregate laws of motion in the subsequent iteration are smaller that
the pre-specified tolerance criterion.
a
In this version of the model, the firm finances investment expenditure with internal funds, equity, and bonds.
Financial frictions imply that equity issuance is subject to dilution costs, while bankruptcy costs imply an additional
loss for bond investors in the case of default.
b
In this version of the model, the firm finances investment expenditures with internal funds and equity only, with
the issuance of the latter not being subject to any dilution costs. As a result, the aggregate debt b̃ is not a state
variable and does not appear in the agents’ perceived laws of motion.

model without financial frictions. According to the goodness-of-fit criteria, the agents’ perceived
aggregate laws of motion are again highly accurate. Note that in this case, the coefficient on the
liquidation value of capital (p− ) in the law of motion for the aggregate capital stock is tiny, which
implies that capital liquidity shocks have a negligible effect on the evolution of the aggregate capital
stock in the absence of financial distortions.
To compute impulse responses for a wider set of endogenous aggregate variables than those
implied by the system of equations (38) and to fully take into account the nonlinearities at play at
the micro level—all while maintaining the assumption of bounded rationality—we use the following
algorithm: Let i = 1, . . . , N index the N heterogeneous firms in the economy, t = 1, . . . , T index the
T periods of the impulse response horizon, and let Z = {zit |i = 1, . . . , N and t = 1, . . . , T } denote
the associated set of idiosyncratic technology states implied by the Markov chain with time-varying
volatility. Using the set Z, we construct two model simulations over the T periods: a simulation
perturbed by an aggregate shock and a simulation without an aggregate shock. Specifically, let
xit denote a generic model variable (e.g., capital stock kit ) and index these two simulations by x1it
and x0it , respectively. Note that the same set of idiosyncratic technology states Z underlies the
construction of x1it and x0it , for all i = 1, . . . , N and t = 1, . . . , T .36 The only difference between

Note: The solid lines depict the impulse response functions of aggregate investment to the specified shock
implied by the benchmark model with financial frictions, which are computed taking into account the nonlinearities of the firms’ investment and financial policies; the red dash-dotted lines are the corresponding impulse
response functions based solely on the agents’ perceived (log-linear) aggregate laws of motion (see the notes
to Figures 6–8 and the main text for details).

these two simulations is that we introduce an aggregate shock at t∗ in the first simulation, which is
then allowed to die out according to its specified law of motion over the remainder of the impulse
response horizon.
To remove the effects of sampling variation associated with the simulation of the idiosyncratic
technology shock, we repeat the above procedure M times. The model-implied impulse response
function of the aggregate variable x in response to an aggregate shock—denoted by x̂h —is then
calculated according to

In implementing this procedure, we set N = 10, 000, T = 45, M = 50, 000, and introduce aggregate
shocks at t∗ = 5.
This computationally intensive approach was chosen, in part, because the response of the model
to various aggregate shocks may not be reflected fully by the log-linear specification of the agents’
perceived aggregate laws of motion. The quantitative significance of failing to account for the
model’s inherent nonlinearities is illustrated in Figure B-1. The solid lines show the response of
aggregate investment to the specified shock constructed according to equation (B-8), while the
dotted lines depict the corresponding responses based solely on the agents’ perceived aggregate
laws of motion. The latter method clearly overstates the sensitivity of aggregate investment to the
aggregate TFP and uncertainty shocks. These differences in impulse responses suggest that the
agents’ perceived laws of motion may be misspecified in spite of the very high R2 values reported in

idiosyncratic technology states. By design, however, the impact of the uncertainty shock today will have an effect

this issue for future research.
