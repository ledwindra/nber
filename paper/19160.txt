ABSTRACT
We argue that the demographic changes caused by the one child policy (OCP) may not harm China’s
long-term growth. This attributes to the higher human capital induced by the intergenerational transfer
arrangement under China’s poor-functioning formal social security system. Parents raise their children
and depend on them for support when they reach an advanced age. The decrease in the number of
children prompted by the OCP resulted in parents investing more in their children’s educations to ensure
retirement consumption. In addition, decreased childcare costs strengthen educational investment through
an income effect. Using a calibrated model, a benchmark with the OCP is compared to three counterfactual
experiments without the OCP. The output under the OCP is expected to be about 4 percent higher
than it would be without the OCP in 2025 under moderate estimates. The output gain comes from
a greatly increased educational investment driven by fewer children (11.4 years of schooling rather
than 8.1). Our model sheds new light on the prospects of China’s long-term growth by emphasizing
the OCP’s growth enhancing role through human capital formation under the intergenerational transfer
arrangement.

Intergenerational Transfer, Human Capital and Long-term Growth in
China under the One Child Policy
Abstract
We argue that the demographic changes caused by the one child policy (OCP) may not harm
China’s long-term growth. This attributes to the higher human capital induced by the
intergenerational transfer arrangement under China’s poor-functioning formal social security
system. Parents raise their children and depend on them for support when they reach an
advanced age. The decrease in the number of children prompted by the OCP resulted in
parents investing more in their children’s educations to ensure retirement consumption. In
addition, decreased childcare costs strengthen educational investment through an income
effect. Using a calibrated model, a benchmark with the OCP is compared to three
counterfactual experiments without the OCP. The output under the OCP is expected to be
about 4 percent higher than it would be without the OCP in 2025 under moderate estimates.
The output gain comes from a greatly increased educational investment driven by fewer
children (11.4 years of schooling rather than 8.1). Our model sheds new light on the prospects
of China’s long-term growth by emphasizing the OCP’s growth enhancing role through human
capital formation under the intergenerational transfer arrangement.

1. Introduction
China’s government introduced the one child policy (OCP) in 1979 with the aim of
controlling rapid population growth. As a result, China experienced a great
demographic transition from high to low rates of fertility and mortality in the
twentieth century (McElroy and Yang, 2000). According to UN world population

2

prospects, there will be an increase in the population of young adults (and its share of
the total population) before the 2020s, a decrease in the childhood population after the
1990s and a continuous increase in the elderly population after 1979. In the
demographic transition, the elderly population is expected to exceed the working-age
population by 2025.1 (See figure 1)
Insert figure 1 here
How the OCP would affect China’s future growth has become one of most widely
considered questions regarding China’s future growth. We first analyze the
relationship between population and economic growth. There have been debates on
this topic for hundreds of years. In his most influential book, Malthus (1798) asserts
that given limited resources, population growth hampers economic growth. Boserup
(1981) is more optimistic. He argues that population may have a scale effect that is
beneficial to economic growth. The Malthusian model treats technological progress as
exogenous, which has also been challenged in more recent studies. Romer (1986,
1990) and Jones (1999) emphasize that the role of population in economic growth
becomes neutral or even positive when allowing technological progress to be
endogenous. Thus, these theories offer no consensus about the OCP’s impact.
Other economists have tried to conduct empirical investigations on this topic. Li
and Zhang (2007) show that the birth rate has had a negative influence on economic
growth, also suggesting that the OCP is growth enhancing. Bloom and Williamson
(1998) highlight the role of the working-age population. According to their studies on
East Asia, the OCP would first enhance economic growth through a fast increase in

In our calibrated model, we define the generational groups as childhood (0-24 years),
young adulthood (25-49 years) and elderly (50 or more years). Typical definitions
place childhood from 0 to 14 years, youth at 15 to 64 years and old age at 65 or more
years, but the trend of China’s demographic transition is robust to different
definitions.

the working-age population, which is called a demographic gift. However, this
demographic gift would dissipate with the rising volume of elderly individuals in the
near future, as depicted in Figure 1. The idea of a disappearing demographic gift in
China has become increasingly popular in the past several years, particularly in light
of the labor shortages experienced in some coastal provinces. Cai (2010) and Zhang et
al. (2011) view it as a sign that the Lewis Turning Point has been reached and express
concern over the challenges to China’s future growth.
We argue that the demographic changes caused by the OCP may not harm China’s
long-term growth as conventionally believed, given parents’ behavior response as
reflected in their children’s educational investment in the OCP under China’s
intergenerational transfer arrangement. Within a poorly functioning formal social
security system, Chinese parents raise their children and depend on them for support
once they have reached an advanced age. Thus, the decrease in the number of children
prompted by the OCP results in parents investing more in their children’s education to
ensure retirement consumption. In addition, the decreased childcare costs strengthen
the educational investment through an income effect. Using a calibrated model, we
compare a benchmark with the OCP to a counterfactual experiment without the OCP.
The model sheds new light on the prospects for China’s long-term growth.
The framework is a three-period overlapping generation economy under the OCP.
In the model, only the parents work for wage income and they take care of the
children and the elderly. The children depend on their parents for support. As a
reward, the parents then depend on their children upon reaching an elderly state. We
assume that the parents ask for a share of their children’s future wage income in the
internal agreement. The parents make decisions and supply labor to the production
sector. Childcare costs are fixed, so they choose their own consumption and the level

4

of the children’s education. The parents have an incentive to invest in their children’s
education because it can increase their children’s future wage income, which will be
shared by parents who have retired in that period.
By plugging China’s demographic structure as shaped by the OCP into the model,
we calibrate the main parameters of the model using data from 1975 to 2000.2 We
then conduct three counterfactual experiments without the OCP. Under moderate
estimates, we find that the output in 2025 would decrease by 4.1 percent without the
OCP despite an increase in the working population of 28.2 percent without the policy.
Our model contributes to the literature in several respects. First and most importantly,
it shows that the OCP is growth enhancing in the long term under the
intergenerational transfer arrangement. It is a well-known fact that Chinese parents
depend on their children for retirement consumption under a poorly functioning social
security system (Banejee et al., 2010). However, there has been little attention paid to
the implication for China’s human capital and growth. Unlike other studies, our model
treats children’s education as an investment rather than a consumption good. This
implies that the intergenerational transfer arrangement would urge parents to invest
more in their children’s education with the OCP in effect, which could by and large
offset the adverse effects of the disappearing demographic gift. Our results are
consistent with those of Li and Zhang (2007), which support the neo-Malthusian
school of thought.
Second, we provide an explanation of Chinese parents’ stronger preference for
more educated children compared to other countries. Li et al. (2008) and Rosenzweig
and Zhang (2009) find that family size has a negative effect for average child
quality(education). This is usually interpreted as a quantity-quality tradeoff originated

2

The time period in the model is 25 years.
5

by Becker and Lewis (1973), which assumes that both the number and education of
children can increase parents’ utility. Yet it does not explain why Chinese parents
prefer education to a greater degree than parents from many other countries. We state
that under the intergenerational transfer arrangement, parents share the return of
education investment in children, thus they have a stronger investment incentive to
ensure their retirement consumption when fertility is constrained by the OCP. It also
partly explains the great increase in the education of the Chinese working-age
population since the 1990s.
Three recent papers are most related to our study, and our study supplements the
literature. Liao (2012) uses a calibrated general equilibrium model and finds that the
OCP promotes human capital and increase per capita output. In her model, the
incentives for investing in children’s education come from the price effect (general
equilibrium) and parents’ preference (quantity-quality tradeoff). Wei and Zhang (2011)
study the competitive saving motive (for a son’s relative attractiveness in the marriage
market) created by the rising sex ratio caused by the OCP. They show that the
competitive saving motive explains much of China’s high savings rate. Neither of
these studies takes the intergenerational transfer into account. Banejee et al. (2010)
notes the popularity of parents’ dependence on their children and introduces it into a
life cycle model to explain Chinese households’ savings behavior. Their focus is on
the OCP’s impact on savings, however, and they do not consider its influence on
education or the long-term growth effects.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide some
background. We summarize the OCP and its impact on demographic structure and
provide evidence of parents’ dependence on their children. In Section 3 we describe
the model. In Section 4 we discuss the calibration. The experiments and results are

2. Background
1. The One Child Policy and China’s Demographic Structure
China’s OCP was formally introduced as a family planning policy that was introduced
in 1978 and initially applied to first-born children beginning in 1979. It officially
restricted married urban couples to having only one child, while allowing exemptions
in several cases including twins, ethnic minorities, rural couples and parents without
any siblings themselves. It was created by the government to alleviate economic,
social and environmental problems in China.
The policy has been strongly enforced mainly through fines that are imposed based
on family income and other factors3, but the implementation varies from location to
location. As mentioned above, the majority of provinces now permit two parents who
were only children themselves to have two children. All non-Han ethnic groups are
usually allowed to have two or more children. Han Chinese living in rural areas are
also permitted to have two children if their first child is female.
After the introduction of the OCP, the fertility rate in China fell from 2.63 births per
woman in 1980 to 1.61 in 2009. According to authorities’ claims, the policy has
prevented about 400 million births in 30 years4, which proved the policy to be
remarkably effective. There has been some debate regarding whether there had
already been a sharp reduction in the fertility rate in the early 1970s (five births per
woman) in China. Thus, the policy is probably only partially responsible for the

There are also some benefits and financial rewards for single-child families including
a small amount of child allowance that continues until the child reaches age 14 and
priority access to schools and health care.

reduction. However, it has played an important role in shaping China’s demographic
structure since the end of the 1970s.
Insert figure 2 here
As figure 2 shows, the proportion of the group aged 24 years and below in the total
population has declined since 1975, from 58.42% in 1975 to 40.53% in 2000.
According to the medium estimates of the world population prospects5, this trend will
continue, declining to 26.80% in 2025, and 21.42% in 2050. Meanwhile, the
proportion of the group aged 49 years and above has continued to increase since 1975,
from 27.48% in 1975 to 38.02% in 2010. It is expected to reach 52.01% in 2050. This
demographic structure has strong implications for China’s future growth.

2. Intergenerational Transfer Arrangement
There is a widely held belief that Chinese parents view their children as a form of
pension for when they are elderly. Although China has made a great deal of effort in
pension reform, Herd, Hu and Koen (2010) point out that under current rules,
effective replacement rates are fairly low and projected to decline further, both for
rural and urban residents, which may be difficult to sustain with the elderly living
increasingly less frequently with their descendants. Furthermore, as the countryside
ages, the problems can become even worse.
A recent survey in China confirms the inefficiency of the pension system. Until
2010, only 24.1% of the elderly relied mainly on a pension while 40.7% depended on

The future population of each country is projected starting with an estimated
population for July 1, 2010. To project future population, the UN Population Division
uses assumptions regarding future trends in fertility, mortality and international
migration. Because future trends cannot be known with certainty, a number of
projection variants are produced. We use the medium fertility projection variant. For
further details, refer to "Assumptions Underlying the 2010 Revision."

their family members for support.6 Using data from the China Household Retirement
Longitudinal Survey (CHRLS), Benerjee et al. (2010) find that as expected, more than
half of the surveyed elderly live with their children and parents are more likely to live
with their children if one of the parents is in poor health, which is consistent with the
belief that children take care of their parents when the latter are elderly. The
advantage of having many children is consistent with the observation that the fraction
of parents living with at least one adult child increases from 56% for parents with
only one child to over 70% for those with seven or eight children.7

3. Educational Transformation
While the educational status of the working-age population has continued to rise in
the past six decades, its structure has undergone major change since the 1990s. Figure
3 shows the average years of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling for the
working-age population based on Barro and Lee (2010). It is clear that tertiary
education gains much higher growth and contributes most to the rise in educational
attainment in the past two decades. This is also documented in Li et al. (2011).
Furthermore, China still exhibits great potential in increasing their human capital
compared to the US, especially in tertiary education (see figure 4).
Insert figure 3 and 4 here
As the World Bank (2012) reports, hundreds of millions of unskilled Chinese
workers joined the global labor force as part of China’s “opening up” strategy in the
1980s and 1990s. Now, tens of millions of tertiary-educated Chinese workers will join

products. The number of college graduates could swell by 200 million over the next
two decades—more than the entire labor force of the United States.

3. The Model
We imagine a simple life cycle divided into three periods: childhood, young
adulthood (parents), and old adulthood (retired). It is assumed that children will not
work, but rather that they will depend on their parents for support, including
subsistence consumption (childcare costs) and educational investment. As a reward,
they agree to provide part of their future wage income to their parents’ retirement
consumption when they enter the workforce in the next period.
The parents supply labor to gain wage income and make decisions. They are
responsible for their children’s subsistence consumption and for their parents’
retirement consumption. They independently choose their own consumption and their
children’s educational investment. Educational investment costs money, but will
increase children’s wage in the next period. We assume that fertility is exogenously
determined under the OCP. That is, parents take the number of children as given.

1. The Basic Model
Define Ltz  etz as the population and educational attainment of generation z , when

z  c y o represents children, young adults and old adults. The survival rate of
children and the life expectancy of old adults might change over time, so we allow
Lct  Lty1  Lot  2  This is easy to check using Table 1.8 We assume that the education

Because our period is 25 years, the quantity of survival rate and life expectancy is a

10

level remains constant as children grow up into young adults, i.e. etc  ety1 
The lifetime utility function of young adults at t is U  cty  cto1  , where ctz is
generation z ’s consumption in period t . We do not add childhood’s subsistence
consumption here, because it is assumed to be the same for everyone and provided by
parents. We also assume that neither children’s nor their own education level enters
an agent’s utility function. It is not uncommon for children’s education to enter the
parents’ preference, given Becker and Lewis (1973), but here we ignore it to focus on
the effect of intergenerational transfers.
We assume a constant return to scale (CRS) Cobb-Douglas production function:

where output is determined by technology At  capital stock K t and human capital
H ty . For human capital, we follow the growth literature (e.g. Hall and Jones, 1999;

Bils and Klenow, 2000) by setting H ty  Lty exp( ety ) . This specification is consistent
with the common Mincer (1974) equation, which implies that the log of the
individual’s wage is linearly related to that individual’s years of schooling. It could
also be interpreted that an additional year of schooling raises a worker’s efficiency
proportionally by  . Choosing the exponential form could allow us to draw on the
large volume of micro evidence on  to quantify the impact of schooling on human
capital and growth.
Assume that capital accumulation and technology progress are exogenous, and the
only income that a young adult earns is his wage income wt Lty  1    Yt  As
discussed above, a young adult would support their retired parents and children. To
simplify the model, we assume that they would share a fixed proportion of their wage

income (  ) with their parents and pay a constant childcare cost ( c sub ) for each of
their children. The remaining part is allocated between their own consumption and the
children’s educational investment. We assume that the educational cost for each
child’s additional years of schooling is pt , and parents make an equal investment for
each child.
Thus, the young adults maximize utility subject to the budget constraint.

increase with the opportunity cost (wage) of schooling because in reality, tuition rises

children’s education to enjoy more retirement consumption from the higher future

Parents’ dependence on children for retirement consumption does influence
children’s education. When  (proportion of shared wage income) increases,
children’s educational level increases.

2. The OCP’s Impact on Education and Growth
Now consider the impact of the OCP. From the budget constraint (1) and first-order
condition (2), it is clear that under stationary population growth ( Lct  Lty  Lot ), the
educational investment would also be stationary. The enforcement of the OCP
decreases the number of Lct , which have two channels through which to affect
children’s education: (1) income effect. That is, there would be fewer mouths to feed
(the childcare cost, Lct c sub , decreases) and the parents’ real income increases; (2)
substitution effect. That is, with fewer children, the parents would increase their
children’s educational investment to ensure shared wage income during retirement.
This is a materialistic motive for the well-known quantity-quality tradeoff.
For simplicity, the changes of technology, capital, cost of education and childcare,

13

survival rate are assumed to be constant. Then it is easy to show that9
Proposition 1. When   At  K t  pt  c sub   t 1 remain constant, the enforcement of the

OCP (1) increases each child’s educational level, and (2) even increases output.
It is a little surprising that the output would increase under the OCP. Why the
response in the human capital can over compensate? Intuitively, this is caused by the
income effect (higher real income and less childcare cost) besides the substitution
effect (quantity-quality trade-off). Thus, the dependence on children will make
parents make strong response to the demographic change caused by the OCP, which
will offset the negative effect on economic output caused by a decreasing labor force.
The proposition has strong implications for China’s long-term growth. It predicts an
relatively optimistic future.
Proposition 1 depends on the assumption that parameter in tuition cost, pt , is
constant. In reality, pt might increase very fast when the educational attainment
reaches a certain level. In that case, OCP’s impact on growth could turn to be
moderate or even negative. However, since China’s current educational attainment is
relatively low compared to the developed countries, the positive impact could still
dominate in the near future.

3. Discussion of the Model
Sharing Rule

We assume a linear sharing rule on wage income to describe the intergenerational
transfer arrangement between young adults and their retired parents. Although we
think it reasonable based on what happens in China, there could be alternative
choices.
9

Proof is provided in Appendix.
14

One alternative is a linear sharing rule on wage. That is, young adults promise the
elderly an average retirement consumption of  wt .(replacement ratio) The model
becomes

This model is similar to our basic model when population growth is stationary




Lty1  Lot 1  . However, the enforcement of the OCP will make Lct  Lty . Thus, it has

the advantage of underlining the burden of the increasing elderly population caused
by the OCP. When the elderly population increases, education will increase reflecting
its high return.
Another alternative is that young adults promise a fixed amount of retirement
consumption  c old  for each parent. The model becomes

 Lct c sub 

cto1  c old Lot 
In this case, the young adults would have no incentive to invest in children’s
education because their retirement consumption is ensured. This model makes sense if
we apply some revisions and let children make decisions on their consumption and
education and pay back their education costs as a loan to parents. The elderly’s
retirement consumption seems like a lump sum tax to them, which would give them
more incentive to gain a higher education. We assume that the parents determine
children’s investment.
Educational Credit Constraints

We assume that households face a credit constraint on educational investment, such
15

that parents must cover all of the costs in the current period. While credit for
education in China has grown in recent years, it still amounts to a small fraction. Most
children’s tuitions and other educational costs are paid by their parents.
Incentive for Educational Investment

The standard model of human capital investments, such as that provided by
Ben-Porath (1967), assumes that the individual chooses the investment (in terms of
time) under perfect capital market conditions, and that the only margin of choice is
between market work and schooling. Bils and Klenow (2000) use it to examine the
relationship between schooling and growth.
Things are different in China. Parents typically make decisions about children’s
educational investment under binding credit constraints. Parents invest in their
children, partially from altruistic parental love and partially in the interest of an
ensured retirement consumption. It is difficult to differentiate one from the other but
due to China’s poor social security system, the latter could be more important, so we
emphasize it.
Measurement of Human Capital

There are various approaches to measuring human capital in the literature. Mankiw et
al. (1992) assume a human capital production technology identical to that of physical
capital and use the proportion of the adult population enrolled in secondary school as
a proxy for human capital investment. However, the school enrollment does not
adequately

We take the more recent approach to measure human capital because it ensures that
our estimates of human capital are consistent with the private return to schooling seen
in the micro data. Our definition is similar to that of Young (2003) and Wang and Yao
(2003) in that it takes both the quantity and the quality of the labor force into
consideration.

4. Calibration
1. Data and Measurement Issues
In our model, a period is 25 years. To account for the effect of the OCP, we must
cover the periods both before and after its enforcement. The model is calibrated to
Chinese data from 1975 to 2000. In 1975, the OCP had not yet been introduced. In
2000, the OCP’s impact on demographic structure emerges. The main parameters can
be calibrated based on the two periods. To explore the effect of the OCP, we compare
it to a counterfactual experiment without the OCP. We also discuss the model’s
implication for China’s long-term growth in 2025 and 2050.

Demographic Structure
Our data cover three periods (1975, 2000, 2025) of China’s demographic structure
gathered from World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision (United Nations,
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2011), which
provides detailed population distribution by 5-year age groups in 5-year intervals
(1950-2010). It also gives the population prospects from 2010 to 2100. We define

17

children as aged 24 years and below, young adults as aged 25 to 49 years and the
elderly as aged 50 years and above. The results are in Table 1. For 2025, we use the
estimated population under medium-fertility variant.

Physical Capital Stock
Many papers have reported estimates of the capital stock in the course of estimating
productivity growth in China (e.g. Chow and Li, 2002; Huang et al., 2002; Young,
2003). The estimates of Bai et al. (2006) regarding the capital stock in China differ
from these earlier estimates in two principal ways. First, they make use of the updated
data reported by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) after the 2004 census.
Second, they calculate the capital stock in market prices rather than in constant
prices.10 We follow the method of Bai et al. (2006) and use their updated estimates of
the capital stock. We take 1978 as the base year to generate real capital stock.

Human Capital Stock
In our model, human capital is measured as a function of years of schooling and
current labor force. The current labor force is the population aged 25 to 49 years in
the current period. The data on years of schooling are calculated from Barro and Lee
(2000, 2010). Their estimation procedure is a perpetual inventory method that uses the
census/survey observations on attainment as benchmark stocks and new school
entrants as flows that are added to the stocks with an appropriate time lag. They
provide a detailed data set on educational attainment by 5-year age groups over 5-year
intervals (1950-2010). Using their data, we construct the number of years of schooling
for aged 25 to 49, ety , as
5

ety   lta eta
a 1

We thank the authors and Zhenjie Qian, their RA, for providing the updated data.

where lta is the population share of group a in the population aged 25 to 49 and
eta is the number of years of schooling for the age group a ( a  1  25  29 age

group, a  2  30  34 age group,..., a  5  45  49 ). The number of years of
schooling for the age group a in time t is
eta   h aj t Durjat
j 1

where h aj is the fraction of group  who have attained the educational level

j  pri sec ter  (coresponding to primary, secondary and tertiary education,
respectively) and Dur indicates the corresponding duration in years. The great
increase in educational attainment of China’s labor force can be seen in Figure 3.

Output
The output data come from the China Statistics Yearbook (CSY). We take 1978 as the
base year to generate real GDP.

2. Calibration Strategy

hold.

Specifically, the steps of calibration are conducted as follows:

(Benchmark) Assume that e2025
 114 ,12 and TFP and capital stock’s

growth in 2000-2025 keep the same as 1975-2000, we calibrate p2000 to fit
the model.
3.

(Cases I, II and III) We then conduct three counterfactual experiments

based on three different estimates (from high to low) of the OCP’s impact on
China’s demographic structure. We use the calibrated model to simulate the
possible impact of the OCP on education and output under these
counterfactual scenarios.
Step I corresponds to the period before the OCP, which is calibrated to show how
the model fits the data. It captures a prior belief. Step II provides the basic benchmark
under the OCP. Step III conducts three counterfactual experiments to evaluate the
impact of the OCP on educational output, based on the three estimates of
counterfactual demographic structure.
Note that this study focuses on how OCP’s impact under different scenarios
y
designed in Step III. Although the number of e2025
in step II is set by a linear

prediction here, it won’t change our main results.

3. The Three Estimates of Demographic Structure
There is no consensus on the OCP’s influence over China’s demographic structure.
The official claim is that the OCP prevented 400 million births in China from 1978 to
2008. Although this is often cited by the government, it is hotly debated. A common
critique is that the fertility rate usually decreases when an economy grows, according

12

We get the number by assuming the young adults’ years of schooling grows from
2000 to 2025 at the same speed as from 1975 to 2000.
20

to the experiences of other industrialized countries. Thus, the effect could be
exaggerated. Thus, we take the officially reported number as a high estimate and also
consider moderate and low estimates (200 and 100 million). The estimates are
adjusted according to the time period for our model. 13 The three estimates are
presented in Table 3.

4. Parameters
Table 2 summarizes the parameters in the calibration. Following Liao (2012), we
choose a CRRA preference with a risk-aversion parameter of   05 and the
subjective discount factor   09557 . It is also assumed that these preference
parameters are constant over time.
For the technology parameter, we first take K from Bai et al. (2010). Because the
labor share has been approximated at 50 percent in China (Wang and Yao , 2003;
Brandt and Zhu, 2010), we set   05 . According to Heckman and Li (2004) and
Zhang et al. (2005), the return to years of schooling is about 10-11 percent for the late
twentieth century in China. We then set   010 .
The other parameters of exogenous driving force include c sub    p The average
cost of rasing a child (excluding education costs) is 22.7 percent of a family’s income,
which follows Liao’s (2012) calculations based on Ye and Ding’s (1998) survey.14 So

c sub is calculated from our data on family income and the childhood population. We

13

Take the high estimate for example. Because our period is 1975-2000, we compute
the population aged 24 and below as Lc2000n  Lc2000  400000  22  30 We also

project it into 2025 as population aged 25-49, using a same survival rate as the rate
under the OCP.
14
Ye and Ding (1998) compare the cost of child care in Xiamen to that in Beijing. In
Xiamen, a child’s care cost about 29 percent of a family’s annual income in 1995. The
percentage was 16.4 percent in Beijing. Thus, the average cost of child care is 22.7
percent.
21

set the share of young adults’ wage income transferred to their elderly parents as

  015 .
The parameter for educational cost p is calibrated as discussed in the calibration
strategy.

5. The Effects of the OCP
1. Results for 1975
Table 4 shows the calibration results for each generation’s expenditure (consumption
and education) in 1975. The data in the first row give the share of expenditure by each
group while those in the second row give the total expenditure and those in the third
row give per capita expenditure. We set the parameters of the share of expenditure on
child care and retired adults as 23 and 15 percent, respectively.
The young adults would spend 30 percent on their own consumption and 32 percent
on their children’s educational investment. The average consumption of young adults
and retired adults is close. These results provide confidence for our further analysis.

2. The OCP’s Influence: Three Counterfactual Experiments
Panel (a) of Table 5 shows the calibration results of each generation’s expenditures
(consumption and education) in 2000. If we believe that the young adults’ years of
schooling reach 11.4 in 2025, then the output becomes 207,788.15. Thus, the growth
rate could reach 8.4 percent from 2000 to 2025, whereas it remains at 7.0 percent
from 2010 to 2025. The young adults would spend 33 percent on their own
consumption and 29 percent on their children’s education.
We then turn to our main results on the OCP’s influence by conducting three
counterfactual experiments assuming that there was no OCP in 1978.
22

Under high estimates (Case I shown in Panel (b)), which assume that the number of
children increases by 56.4 percent without the OCP, the young adults’ years of
schooling would decrease to 5.12 in 2025. The young adults would spend 25 percent
of their income on their own consumption and 24 percent on their children’s
education. As a contrast, they must spend 35 percent of their income on child care
because there are many more children to feed.
Under moderate estimates (Case II shown in Panel (c)), which assume that the
number of children increases by 28.2 percent without the OCP, the young adults’
years of schooling would decrease less, reaching 8.07. The young adults would spend
29 percent of their income on their own consumption and 27 percent on their
children’s education. The child care costs would decrease to 29 percent because the
number of children would not be as big as in Case I.
Under low estimates (Case III shown in Panel (d)), which assume that the number
of children increases by 28.2 percent without the OCP, the young adults’ years of
schooling would decrease to 9.67, which would be higher than in Case II. The young
adults would spend 31 percent of their income on their own consumption and 28
percent on their children’s education. The child care costs would decrease to 26
percent.
Taken together, the results indicate that young adults will increase the investment
in their children’s education when the OCP comes into effect. To ensure their
retirement consumption, the more strictly the policy is implemented, the fewer
children young adults will have and the more they will invest in their children’s
education. The behavioral response of substituting quantity with quality (education)
will offset the OCP’s negative influence on output. Because the presence of fewer
children substantially reduces the child care costs, the output under the OCP will be

23

higher than that without the OCP due to the income effect. Taking moderate estimates
as an example, the output would be 199153.50 without the OCP, which is 4.2 percent
lower than the output under the OCP.

6. Conclusion
We claim that the demographic changes caused by the one child policy (OCP) may
not harm China’s long-term growth. This attributes to the higher human capital
induced by the intergenerational transfer arrangement under China’s poor social
security system. Parents raise their children and depend on them for support once they
have reached an advanced age. Thus, the decrease in the number of children prompted
by the OCP results in the parents investing more in their children’s education to
ensure their retirement consumption. In addition, the decreased child care costs
strengthen the educational investment through the income effect. Our numerical
simulation proves these insights. Using a calibrated model, we compare a benchmark
with the OCP to three counterfactual scenarios without the OCP. The output under the
OCP is about 4 percent higher than without the OCP in 2025 under moderate
estimates. The output gain comes from the greatly increased educational investment in
fewer children (years of schooling 11.4 rather than 8.1). Our model sheds new light
on the prospects of China’s long-term growth by emphasizing the OCP’s growth
enhancing role through human capital under the intergenerational transfer
arrangement, which also provides a motive for the popular quantity-quality tradeoff
theory.
Human capital could still play an important role in China. We assume that the
average years of schooling will reach 11.4 in 2025. Compared to 13.4 years of
schooling in the US in 2010, there is still some potential for China to maintain its high

24

growth in the future. Thus, we think that the disappearing demographic gift will not
hurt China’s growth in the next several decades.
