    "abstract": "\n\nWe estimate productivity growth in England from 1250 to 1870. Real wages over this period were heavily influenced by plague-induced swings in the population. Our estimates account for these Malthusian dynamics. We find that productivity growth was zero prior to 1600. Productivity growth began in 1600\u2014almost a century before the Glorious Revolution. Thus, the onset of productivity growth preceded the bourgeois institutional reforms of 17th century England. We estimate productivity growth of 2% per decade between 1600 and 1800, increasing to 5% per decade between 1810 and 1860. Much of the increase in output growth during the Industrial Revolution is explained by structural change\u2014the falling importance of land in production\u2014rather than faster productivity growth. Stagnant real wages in the 18th and early 19th centuries\u2014\u201cEngel\u2019s Pause\u201d\u2014is explained by rapid population growth putting downward pressure on real wages. Yet, feedback from population growth to real wages is sufficiently weak to permit sustained deviations from the \u201ciron law of wages\u201d prior to the Industrial Revolution.\n\n",
