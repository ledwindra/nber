ABSTRACT
We estimate the effects of electricity shortages on Indian manufacturers, instrumenting with supply
shifts from hydroelectric power availability. We estimate that India’s average reported level of shortages
reduces the average plant’s revenues and producer surplus by five to ten percent, but average productivity
losses are significantly smaller because most inputs can be stored during outages. Shortages distort
the plant size distribution, as there are significant economies of scale in generator costs and shortages
more severely affect plants without generators. Simulations show that offering interruptible retail electricity
contracts could substantially reduce the impact of shortages.

Abstract
We estimate the effects of electricity shortages on Indian manufacturers, instrumenting with
supply shifts from hydroelectric power availability. We estimate that India’s average reported
level of shortages reduces the average plant’s revenues and producer surplus by five to ten percent, but average productivity losses are significantly smaller because most inputs can be stored
during outages. Shortages distort the plant size distribution, as there are significant economies
of scale in generator costs and shortages more severely affect plants without generators. Simulations show that offering interruptible retail electricity contracts could substantially reduce the
impact of shortages.

One of the potential contributors to the large productivity gap between developed and developing
countries is low-quality infrastructure, and one of the most stark examples of infrastructure failures
is electricity supply in India. In the summer of 2012, India suffered the largest power failure in
history, a cascading blackout that plunged 600 million people into darkness at its peak (Yardley and
Harris 2012). Even under normal circumstances, however, the Indian government estimates that
shortages currently amount to about ten percent of demand at current prices. In the 2005 World

Bank Enterprise Survey, one-third of Indian business managers named poor electricity supply as
their biggest barrier to growth. According to these managers, blackouts are far more important
than other barriers that economists frequently study, including taxes, corruption, credit, regulation,
and low human capital.1
In this paper, we ask: how do electricity shortages affect input choices, revenue, and productivity
in the Indian manufacturing sector? One potential prior is that because electricity is an essential
input - most factories cannot produce anything without electricity for lights, motors, and machines
- shortages could significantly reduce output. On the other hand, many firms might insure themselves against outages by purchasing generators or otherwise substituting away from grid electricity
precisely because the potential losses are so large. The limited existing evidence could support either argument. Foster and Steinbuks (2009) and others argue that the cost of self-generation is
relatively small, and Alam (2013) and Fisher-Vanden, Mansur, and Wang (2015) highlight ways
in which plants substitute away from electricity when shortages worsen. In contrast, Hulten, Bennathan, and Srinivasan (2006) argue that growth of roads and electric generation capacity accounts
for a remarkable 50 percent of productivity growth in Indian manufacturing between 1972 and
1992.
There are at least two reasons why this question is difficult to answer empirically. First, the
necessary data on electricity shortages are typically not available: countries that have shortages
are often the same types of countries that do not gather and disclose high-quality data on their
infrastructure. Second, shortages are not exogenous to productivity or production. For example,
rapid economic growth could cause an increase in electricity demand that leads to shortages, or
poor institutions could lead to insufficient power supply and also reduce productivity. Either of
these two mechanisms would bias estimates of the effects of shortages, albeit in opposite directions.
We begin by detailing an extensive array of data that we have gathered on the Indian electric
power sector, including official state-specific electricity shortage estimates dating to 1992. We have
made these data publicly available as the India Energy Data Repository (Allcott, Collard-Wexler,
and O’Connell 2015). To our knowledge, these are the only systematic accounts of electricity
shortages available historically in any country suffering endemic blackouts. We document how
electricity supply in India has continually lagged demand over the past 20 years, but shortage
levels vary substantially within states over time.
We present a modified Cobb-Douglas production function model to predict how variation in
electricity shortages affects existing plants. For plants with generators, shortages act like a timevarying electricity input tax: during a grid power outage, the plants self-generate electricity at
higher cost. Plants without generators shut down during outages, as if hit by an infinite input
tax. This “input tax effect” causes all plants to contract, especially those without generators. The
primary productivity loss is that plants without generators waste non-flexible inputs. For example,
when textile plants shut down, their buildings and machines continue depreciating, but they leave

thread on the looms without waste. Percent revenue losses must exceed percent productivity losses,
because productivity feeds directly into revenue and plants’ contraction due to the input tax effect
further reduces revenue.
Drawing on the model, we then estimate how variation in shortages affects plants in India’s
official manufacturing survey, the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI). We instrument for shortages
with shifts in electricity supply from hydroelectric power availability, conditional on state-level
rainfall and other controls. In support of the exclusion restriction, we show that these supply shifts
are not conditionally associated with agricultural output, electricity prices, or official estimates of
what demand would be in the absence of shortages.
Our instrumental variables estimates show that shortages have positive but economically small
effect on variable energy input costs for plants with generators: a one percentage point increase in
shortages increases their average fuel expenditures by 0.18 percent of revenues, and this is largely
offset by the decrease in grid electricity purchases. Average revenues drop by 1.1 percent, but
materials input drops by almost exactly that same amount. Since materials represent 70 percent of
revenues on average, revenue productivity (TFPR) does not decrease nearly as much as revenues.
The results are economically similar and statistically indistinguishable under a battery of alternative
specifications.
As the instrumental variables estimates are identified by annual variation in hydro availability,
they capture primarily “short-run” effects of shortages, i.e. holding constant decisions such as
generator capital stock and plant entry and exit. To shed light on long-run effects, we briefly study
the association between plant characteristics and the average shortages in the two years preceding
plant entry. We find suggestive evidence that plants in electricity-intensive industries are less likely
to enter when shortages worsen, implying that shortages may have deeper effects on the composition
of Indian industry.
Finally, we apply our production function model to ASI plants to simulate the effects of shortages. Analogous to Todd and Wolpin (2006), we validate the structural model using the agreement
of the model’s prediction with the reduced form results. The simulated effects and IV estimates
are statistically indistinguishable, which builds confidence that the estimates are reasonable and
the model captures the first-order effects of shortages. The officially-assessed level of shortages is
controversial because it is difficult to accurately assess demand in the absence of shortages. Subject
to that caveat, we simulate that the assessed level of shortages reduced producer surplus by 9.5
percent, revenues by 5.6 percent, and productivity by 1.5 percent for the average plant in 2005.
Aside from these headline numbers, the simulations deliver two additional insights. First, shortages more severely affect plants that do not have generators, and generator costs have significant
economies of scale. We simulate that as a result, variable profit losses average 2-3 times larger
for small plants compared to large plants, which could distort India’s plant size distribution in
favor of large plants. Second, we simulate the effect of interruptible electricity contracts, which
offer plants reduced retail prices in exchange for accepting more frequent power outages. These

3

contracts efficiently allocate shortages to plants that can best deal with them, and our simulations
show that if implemented nationwide, they could reduce producer surplus losses by more than an
order of magnitude. While interruptible contracts do require additional physical infrastructure to
implement, they may be a useful partial solution because political barriers have prevented reforms
to India’s significantly distorted retail electricity prices.
The remainder of this section discusses related literature. Section I details the data. Section
II provides background on the Indian electricity sector, the causes of electricity shortages, and
manufacturers’ responses to shortages. Section III presents the production function model and
TFPR estimates. Sections IV and V present the empirical strategy and results. Section VI details
the counterfactual simulations, and Section VII concludes.
Related Literature – Our paper builds on an extensive literature that estimates the economic
effects of investment in electricity, transportation, and other infrastructure. One early group of
studies examines the effects of infrastructure investment on growth in panel data from U.S. states,
including Aschauer (1989), Holtz-Eakin (1994), Fernald (1999), Garcia-Mila, McGuire, and Porter
(1996); see Gramlich (1994) for a review. Easterly and Rebelo (1993), Esfahani and Ramirez (2002),
and Roller and Waverman (2001) carry out analogous studies using cross-country panels.
The cross-state and cross-country literatures faced two basic problems. First, infrastructure
spending is often endogenous to economic growth. Second, using aggregate infrastructure spending
or quantity as the independent variable often hides important variation in effects between infrastructure of different types or quality levels. In the Indian context, for example, spending on power
plants does not necessarily translate into electricity provision, because plants are frequently offline
due to mechanical failure or fuel shortages.
Our paper is part of a recently-growing literature that evaluates the effects of infrastructure
by combining microdata with within-country variation generated by natural experiments. This
includes Banerjee, Duflo, and Qian (2012), Donaldson (2012), and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2013)
on the effects of railroads in China, India, and the United States, Duflo and Pande (2007) on
irrigation dams in India, Jensen (2007) on information technology, Baisa, Davis, Salant, and Wilcox
(2008) on the benefits of reliable water provision in Mexico, and Baum-Snow (2007, 2013), BaumSnow, Brandt, Henderson, Turner, and Zhang (2013), and Baum-Snow and Turner (2012) on urban
transport expansions in China and the United States.
A subset of this literature focuses on electricity supply: Chakravorty, Pelli, and Marchand
(2013), Dinkelman (2011), Lipscomb, Mobarak, and Barham (2013), and Rud (2012a) study the
effects of electricity grid expansions, while Alby, Dethier, and Straub (2011), Foster and Steinbuks
(2009), Steinbuks (2011), Steinbuks and Foster (2010), Reinikka and Svensson (2002), and Rud
(2012b) study firms’ generator investment decisions. Several recent papers focus specifically on
Indian electricity supply: Ryan (2013) estimates the potential welfare gains from expanding transmission infrastructure, Cropper, Limonov, Malik, and Singh (2011) and Chan, Cropper, and Malik
(2014) study the efficiency of Indian coal power plants, Abeberese (2012) tests how changes in

4

electricity prices affect manufacturing productivity, and Alam (2013) studies how India’s steel and
rice milling industries respond differently to variable electricity supply. Fisher-Vanden, Mansur,
and Wang (2015) is perhaps the most closely related paper to ours. They quantify the impacts
of electricity shortages in the early 2000s on a sample of the largest Chinese manufacturing firms,
finding that as shortages worsened, firms purchased more electricity-intensive inputs.
Our main contribution to the literature is to estimate the effects of electricity shortages across
an entire country’s manufacturing sector. Such an aggregate estimate is important because while
Indian policymakers are well aware that shortages are a problem, India also has many other problems. Quantifying the losses from this and other distortions helps policymakers to allocate scarce
time and political capital to the most “binding” constraints to growth, as suggested by the framework of Hausmann, Rodrik, and Velasco (2008). Aside from quantifying the magnitude of the
problem, we also quantify a potential partial solution: interruptible contracts, which due to their
technocratic nature could be more politically feasible than market liberalization. In addition to
policy insights, we provide additional economic insights about industry in developing countries:
we show how shortages might affect the plant size distribution and point out that while shortages
might substantially affect manufacturing output, the short-run effects we estimate explain little of
the manufacturing productivity gap between India and more developed countries.2

Data

We have collected comprehensive data from 1992 to 2010 on weather, the power sector, and manufacturing production.3 All financial amounts are deflated to real 2004 Rupees (Rs).4 Throughout
the paper, we use the word “state” to refer to states, Union Territories, and the National Capital
Region (New Delhi).

I.A

Weather Data

Rainfall data are from the University of Delaware, which provides monthly rainfall for geographic
gridpoints spaced at 1/2 degree intervals (Willmott and Matsuura 2012). We sum to total annual
rainfall by gridpoint, then calculate state-by-year average rainfall by averaging across all gridpoints within each state. Temperature data are from the National Climate Centre, which provides
daily temperatures for geographic gridpoints at one degree intervals (Srivastava, Rajeevan, and
Kshirsagar 2009). For each day at each gridpoint, we construct cooling degrees in Fahrenheit:
max{0,Day’s Average Temperature - 65}. We then calculate state-by-year average cooling degrees

All data are originally reported in, or calculated to correspond to, the Indian fiscal year, which is April 1 through
March 31. In this paper, “year” thus refers to the fiscal year, and for simplicity we refer to only the fiscal year’s
initial calendar year. (For example, “1998” always means “April 1998 through March 1999.”)

observations of weather data, as well as the power sector data described below.

I.B

Power Sector Data

Power sector data are from India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA). The CEA collects many
of the same data that the U.S. Energy Information Administration makes available online. Unfortunately, the CEA’s website includes only a scattered set of recent information, and their on-site
archive of hard copies is incomplete, so individual data series must be hand-collected from CEA
staff. With the cooperation of CEA management and the help of several research assistants in
New Delhi, we gathered, digitized, and cleaned extensive data on the Indian power sector dating
back to 1992 or before. The cleaned and digitized data are now available as the India Energy Data
Repository, at www.indiaenergydata.info.
The primary measure of electricity shortages is the percent energy deficit reported in the Load
Generation Balance Reports (CEA 1993-2011b). At the end of each year, analysts from the CEA
and Regional Power Committees estimate the counterfactual quantity that would have been demanded in each state and month at current prices in the absence of shortages. We refer to this
state-level annual figure as “Assessed Demand.” “Energy Available” is the sum of electricity available at power plants and from net imports. The CEA measure of shortages (hereafter, “Shortage”)
is the percent of demand in state s in year t that is unmet:
Sst =

Assessed Demandst − Energy Availablest
Assessed Demandst

(1)

Both Assessed Demand and Energy Available are growing rapidly due to economic growth:
nationwide totals of both variables increased by a factor of 2.9 between 1992 and 2010. Thus,
shortages can be thought of as the extent to which supply growth lags demand growth.
The CEA also estimates “Peak Shortage,” an analogous measure of power shortage in peak
demand periods. Peak Shortage and Shortage are highly correlated (R2 = 0.56), and robustness
checks will show that results are similar when we use Peak Shortage instead of Shortage.
The Shortage variable depends on an administrative assessment of counterfactual demand, so it
is almost certainly measured with error. Potential attenuation bias is one reason why it is important
to instrument for Shortage in our empirical analysis. However, correlations with independent data
suggest that the CEA’s estimates do contain meaningful information. Columns 1-3 of Table 2 show
that in the World Bank Enterprise Survey, plants in higher-Shortage states self-generate a larger
share of electricity, report worse power quality, and are more likely to report that electricity is their
primary obstacle to growth. Column 4 shows that coal power plant capacity factors are positively
5
“Rainfall” is more precisely “precipitation,” as it includes winter snowfall in the Himalayan states. University
of Delaware and NCC both provide precipitation and temperatures. We use the University of Delaware rainfall
because of the finer geographic scale, although the two data sources are extremely highly correlated. We need daily
temperatures to construct cooling degrees, and the University Delaware only provides monthly average temperatures.

associated with Shortage, suggesting that coal plants are being run more to respond to a tighter
supply-demand balance.6 Furthermore, Alam (2013) shows that Peak Shortage is correlated with
her measure of blackouts, which is based on nighttime lights measured by satellites, and our main
empirical results will show that Shortage is strongly correlated with hydroelectricity supply and
with manufacturing outcomes such as self-generation.

From a publication called the General Review (CEA 1994-2012a), we observe total electricity
sold to consumers, hydroelectric generation, total hydroelectric generation capacity, total generation
capacity, and previous year capacity added, all at the state-by-year level. The General Review also
includes state-specific allocations for power plants that are jointly owned by multiple states; see
Online Appendix Table A2.
From the annual Review of Performance of Hydro Power Stations, we observe annual inflows
into major reservoirs and electricity generation at plants behind each reservoir. Coverage grows
over the sample, due to both new construction and entry of existing reservoirs into the sample
(CEA 1993-2011c). The 1992 data include 16 reservoirs, while the 2010 data include 31 reservoirs
with plants comprising 50 percent of national hydroelectric generation capacity. To get inflowpredicted capacity factors separately for each reservoir-year, we regress generation on inflows and
divide predicted generation by annual generation capacity.7 We will use fdt , the demeaned inflow6

This test is inspired by Fisher-Vanden, Mansur, and Wang (2015), whose empirical analysis directly uses thermal
plant capacity factors as a proxy for shortages.

By “annual generation capacity,” we refer to potential generation at full capacity. Annual generation capacity in
megawatt-hours is power production capacity in megawatts multiplied by 8760 hours per year.

The Review of Performance of Hydro Power Stations also includes capacity and annual generation for all hydro plants in India. We divide generation by annual generation capacity and de-mean
within plant to construct demeaned capacity factors fdt . We also have collected information on
each plant’s design, primarily from the Global Energy Observatory database (Gupta and Shankar
2014). About 18 percent of plants have run-of-river designs without reservoirs, meaning that they
cannot adjust generation in response to electricity demand.
The CEA has lost its reservoir data for 2000 and its hydro plant generation data for 1992, so
we impute data in those years using rainfall within the watershed.8 Online Appendix B provides
more information on the power sector data.

Annual Survey of Industries Data

We use India’s Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for establishment-level microdata. Registered
factories with over 100 workers (the “census scheme”) are surveyed every year, while smaller establishments (the “sample scheme”) are typically surveyed every three to five years. We use the ASI
sample weights to produce estimates valid for the population of registered factories in India.9 The
publicly available ASI includes establishment identifiers that are consistent across years beginning
in 1998. While working in India, we also gained access to a version of the ASI with establishment
identifiers before 1998, allowing us to construct a plant-level panel for the entire 1992-2010 sample.
The ASI is comparable to manufacturing surveys in the United States and other countries.
Variables include revenues, value of fixed capital stock, total workers employed, total costs of
labor, materials, fuel, and grid electricity purchased, and the physical quantity of grid electricity
purchased, self-generated electricity, and electricity consumed. Industries are grouped using India’s
NIC (National Industrial Classification) codes, which are closely related to SIC (Standard Industrial
Classification) codes. Online Appendix C gives more detail on the ASI data preparation and
cleaning.
Panel B of Table 1 presents sample-weighted summary statistics for the ASI. There are 615,721

Specifically, we use GIS elevation maps and the latitude-longitude coordinate of each dam to determine each hydro
plant’s “watershed,” i.e. all higher elevations that drain through the plant. We aggregate rainfall across gridpoints
within the watershed to get annual within-watershed rainfall. For each plant (or reservoir), we run a regression of
rainfall on generation (or reservoir inflows) using all years of data, then predict generation in 1992 (or reservoir inflows
in 2000). Because there are not weather stations in every watershed, these within-watershed rainfall data are largely
interpolated and/or simulated, so they are highly correlated with state-level rainfall and are not perfect predictors of
reservoir inflows or generation by run-of-river plants.

While the weighted ASI sample is representative of factories registered under the Factories Act, not all manufacturing establishments are registered. Small factories with fewer than ten workers (or those with fewer than 20 workers
without electricity) are not required to register under the Factories Act and are thus excluded from the sampling
frame. Nagaraj (2002) points out that there may also be some registration avoidance, especially for smaller plants
near the registration threshold. While unregistered plants comprise around 80 percent of employment in the manufacturing sector (Hsieh and Klenow 2014), they contribute a smaller share (around one-third) to total manufacturing
output (Sincavage, Haub, and Sharma 2010). If these smaller unregistered plants are less likely to have generators
or high-quality grid power, the effects of shortages on the full manufacturing sector could be larger than for our ASI
sample.

plant-by-year observations at 224,684 unique plants, although observation counts differ across variables due to non-response and cleaning procedures described in Online Appendix C. 107,032 plants
will be immediately dropped from our fixed effects and difference estimators because they are observed only once. For plants observed multiple times, 60 percent of intervals between observations
are one year, while 91 percent are five years or less.
The mean (median) plant employs 79 (34) people and has gross revenues of 139 million (20
million) Rupees, or in U.S. dollars approximately $3 million ($400,000). 1(Self-Generator) is an
indicator variable for whether a plant self-generates electricity.10 Self-Generation Share is the
ratio of electricity purchased to electricity consumed, and Fuel Revenue Share is the value of fuels
purchased divided by revenues. Forty-one percent of unweighted observations are in the census
scheme, although the table shows that 14 percent of registered factories are in the census scheme
after applying sample weights.

Background

II.A

Reasons for Systemic Shortages

At the end of our study period in 2010, India had 174 gigawatts of utility-scale power generation
capacity, or about one-sixth the U.S. total.11 Of this, 53 percent was coal, ten percent was natural
gas, and 22 percent was hydroelectric. While power generation has been open to private investment
since India’s 1991 liberalization, 80 percent of electricity supply in 2010 remained government
owned: 51 percent by states and 29 percent by the central government. Most retail distribution
companies are also state-run, although some have been privatized.
The immediate reason for shortages is that the retail distribution companies cannot raise retail
prices to clear the market. In fact, conditional on state and year effects, there is no correlation
between the Shortage variable and the median electricity price paid by plants in the ASI. However,
such a disconnect between retail price and market conditions is common to nearly all power systems
around the world, including many that do not experience endemic shortages. There are several
underlying reasons why shortages arise in India and many other developing countries.
The first reason is the “infrastructure quality and subsidy trap” (McRae 2015): distribution
companies provide low-quality electricity, consumers tolerate this low quality because they pay low
prices, government subsidies cover distribution companies’ losses from the low prices, and politicians
support the subsidies to avoid voter backlash. At least since the 1970s, state-run distribution
companies have offered un-metered electricity at a monthly fixed fee and zero marginal cost to
10
While the ASI does not explicitly ask plants whether they own a generator, 1(Self-Generator) is a very good
proxy, as it would be unusual in India for a plant to own a generator but never use it. Comparison with the 2005
World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) provides supporting evidence: 81 percent of plants with 100 or more workers
and 38 percent with fewer than 100 workers in the 2005 ASI ever self-generate electricity, while 83 percent of plants
with 100 or more workers and 46 percent with fewer than 100 workers in the 2005 WBES report owning generators.

agricultural consumers (Bhargava and Subramaniam 2009). These low agricultural prices are crosssubsidized by industrial electricity prices that are nearly four times higher.

Furthermore, 26

percent of electricity generated in India in 2010 was lost due to “technical and commercial losses,”
meaning poor transmission infrastructure and uncollected bills.12

As a result of low prices and

losses, distribution companies’ revenues from power sales were 24 percent less than costs in 2010.
To cover the low agricultural prices, state governments promise large subsidies, which amounted
to 20 percent of distribution companies’ revenues in 2009 and 11 percent in 2010.

Even after

receiving subsidies, however, distribution companies lost a total of $61 billion (in real 2004 dollars)
between 1992 and 2010.

Resulting financial constraints constrain infrastructure investment and

maintenance, and degraded infrastructure further increases the probability of power outages. The
government bails out the state power utilities at irregular intervals.
A second underlying reason for shortages is underinvestment in new generation capacity: supply
is not keeping up with rapid demand growth.

After the 1991 liberalization, investors signed 200

memoranda of understanding with the government to build 50 gigawatts of generation capacity,
but less than four gigawatts of this was actually built (Bhargava and Subramaniam 2009). Of
the 71 gigawatts of capacity targeted to be built between 1997 and 2007, only half was actually
achieved (CEA 2013). Potential power plant investors face concerns over both output demand and
input supply. Their main customers, the distribution companies, face serious financial problems.
Meanwhile, the main coal supplier is Coal India, a government-run monopoly that is struggling to
keep pace with demand growth (Chilkoti and Crabtree 2014).
Furthermore, existing capacity is systematically underutilized. Between 1994 and 2009, Indian
coal power plants were offline about 28 percent of the time due to forced outages, planned maintenance, coal shortages, and other factors. When capacity is utilized, India’s coal plants are also
substantially less efficient than comparable plants in the United States (Chan, Cropper, and Malik
2014).

II.B

Variation in Shortages

Figure 1 plots the average shortage for each state over our 1992-2010 study period against its
annualized per-capita GDP growth over the same period. The figure illustrates that shortages vary
substantially across states. The cross-sectional correlation between shortages and growth is noisy
but potentially negative, suggesting that poor institutions and other factors both cause slow growth
and worsen shortages.13 On the other hand, states such as Rajasthan and Punjab have both slow
growth and low shortages, partially because slow growth makes it easier for supply to keep up with
demand. This discussion highlights the importance of instrumenting for shortages in the empirical
analysis.

Notes: This figure plots each state’s average shortage over the 1992-2010 study period vs. its per capita
GDP growth rate over that period. Shortage data are estimated by the Central Electricity Authority.

Shortages also vary substantially within states over time. Figure 2 illustrates this for five large
states. Uttar Pradesh experiences relatively high and variable shortages, while West Bengal has
had consistently low shortages for the past 20 years. Karnataka faced almost zero shortage in the
mid-2000s but had significant shortages in the early to mid-1990s. Gujarat had relatively reliable
power supply by the end of the study period, but shortages were more severe in the mid-2000s.
Several factors drive this year-to-year variation in shortages. On the demand side, fast economic
growth over a few years can increase shortages, and air conditioner use during an unusually hot
summer can substantially increase electricity demand. On the supply side, power plant outages
due to maintenance or coal shortages can worsen electricity shortages. For our instrument, we will
focus on two supply shifters: new plants coming online, which can temporarily alleviate shortages,
and variation in water availability for hydroelectricity production.
In 2009 and 2010, respectively, five and seven percent of electricity generated nationwide was
exchanged across states.14

Because distribution companies are able to procure power from other

states, supply-demand imbalances do not vary as much as they would under autarky.

These are our calculations based on data in the Load Generation Balance Reports.

Industrial Electricity Use in India

A natural response to shortages is to self-generate electricity. We calculate that total electricity
generation by ASI manufacturing plants equals 35 percent of their total consumption, more than
twice the 15.8 percent for US manufacturers reported in the Manufacturing Energy Consumption
Survey (MECS) (U.S. DOE 2013). Figure 3 compares the ratio of electricity generated to electricity
consumed at Indian plants (from the ASI) to US plants (from the MECS), with each dot reflecting
a three-digit NIC industry code.15
The figure highlights two important facts. First, there is a strong correlation between the US
and Indian data, suggesting that the ASI self-generation data are meaningful. In the United States,
where power outages are relatively unimportant, many industries still produce a substantial fraction
of electricity consumed. For example, in the sugar refining industry, byproducts from sugarcane
processing can be burned to generate electricity, so there is a natural complementarity between
manufacturing operations and electricity generation. Second, the mass of points along the vertical
15

This ratio of generation to consumption differs slightly from Self-Generation Share because electricity generated
also includes electricity sales by manufacturing plants to others. Several industries don’t match well between the two
datasets: chemicals and refining are not broken out into many different sub-industries in the public US data, so Indian
sub-industries such as Explosives, Chemicals Not Elsewhere Classified (NEC), Matches, and Perfumes and Cosmetics
are matched to “Chemicals,” a broader industry where other establishments are more likely to have feedstock for
self-generation, and thus a higher self-generation share. Similarly, Natural Gas and LPG Bottling, Coal NEC, and
Coke Oven Products are matched to “Petroleum and Coal Products,” another very broad category.

For instance, plastics manufacturers in the U.S. produce none of their power, while production by
Indian plastics manufacturers equals 70 percent of their electricity consumption.

Model and Production Function Estimation
Setup

This section presents a model of how electricity shortages affect manufacturing plants. τ indexes
points in time, which we refer to as “days.” Every day, a plant uses capital K, labor L, electricity
E, and materials M to produce output Q. Qitτ denotes the output for plant i in year t on day τ ,
´
and Qit ≡ τ Qitτ dτ is the annual aggregate. The measure of “days” in a year is normalized to one.
We do not model the possibility for inter-day substitution.16
The daily production function is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of capital, labor, electricity, and
materials, with physical productivity Ait 17 :
16

In Online Appendix F, we present a model that does allow inter-day substitution.
Our earlier working paper used a production function that is Leontief in electricity, thus ruling out substitution

away from electricity during power outages: Qitτ = min{AKitτ

electricity intensity. We show in Online Appendix F that for our particular outcomes of interest, the Leontief model’s
main predictions are similar to those from the full Cobb-Douglas model.

Since we observe revenues rather than physical quantities produced, we need to relate revenues
to our production function in Equation (2). We assume that plants sell into a perfectly competitive
output market with price p, and we define revenue productivity (TFPR) as Ωit = Ait p.18 This
yields the following daily revenue-generating production function:
αK αL
αM αE
Ritτ = Ωit Kitτ

Power Outages, Inputs, and Timing

On each day, there are two states of the world - a power outage state and a no-outage state. The
outage occurs with probability δ, and δ is known at the beginning of the year. If there is no
outage, plants can purchase electricity from the grid at price pE,G . If there is an outage, plants
with generators can self-generate electricity at price pE,S > pE,G . Plants without generators have
zero electricity input during an outage, so they produce zero output. Notice that setting electricity
input to zero for δ percent of the year is different from a δ percent reduction in electricity use, and
the effect of power outages can be much larger than the electricity coefficient αE .
There are three types of inputs:
1. Fixed inputs are chosen before δ and Ωit are known. For the model and simulations, we
assume that capital stock Kit is fixed.
2. Yearly-flexible inputs can be modified at the beginning of a year t after observing δ and Ωit ,
but they cannot be modified from day to day. For the model and simulations, we treat labor
as yearly-flexible, as plants cannot hire and fire workers from one moment to the next as
blackouts occur. This gives Litτ = Lit .19
3. Fully-flexible inputs can be modified for each day τ after observing whether or not there is
an outage. We treat materials and electricity as fully flexible.
18

We could alternatively assume that plants sell into an imperfectly competitive output market with daily demand

curve QD = BP  . This yields identical results, except with revenue productivity redefined as Ω ≡ A1+  B −  and
1
production function coefficients βX = αX (1+  ) for X = {K, L, M, E}. Using a demand curve that depends on annual
output would introduce dynamics into this problem, as production on day τ would affect prices, and consequently
input choices, on other days of the year.
19
In some industries such as plastics, material inputs can be spoiled during a power outage. In these cases, it might
be more plausible to assume that materials are also semi-flexible, and it is straightforward to change the model in
this way.

Define MitG and MitS as materials input during grid power and outage periods, respectively,
and define EitG and EitS as well as RitG and RitS analogously. For non-generators, the same first
order conditions hold except that there is no production during outages, so MitS = EitS = RitS = 0.
When setting labor, the plant begins with its yearly profit function, which is simply the weighted
average of Equation (4) over grid power and outage periods. The first-order condition yields

These first-order conditions show that for plants with generators, power outages act exactly
like a time-varying input tax on electricity. The electricity price increase causes plants to reduce
electricity input, which reduces the marginal revenue products of materials and labor, so plants
reduce those inputs as well. We call this input reduction the input tax effect. The effect is larger
for non-generators, because power outages require them to shut down, as if facing an infinite input
tax.

Using lower-case variables to denote natural logs, revenues are:
rit = αK kit + αL lit + αM mit + αE eit + ωit + vit .

(10)

Define “measured TFPR” ω̂it as the difference between logged revenues and input contributions:
ω̂it = rit − αK kit − αL lit − αM mit − αE eit = ωit + vit .

(11)

Equation (10) shows that outages reduce revenue through two mechanisms. First, plants reduce
inputs lit , mit , and eit through the input tax effect. Second, measured TFPR ω̂it changes by vit .
The revenue loss must be larger than the measured TFPR loss because the input tax effect also
causes plants to contract.
For plants with generators, Equation (9) shows that Vit is the effect of using different bundles of
fully-flexible inputs in outage and grid power periods, relative to using the same weighted average
bundle in all periods. In the standard case where αM + αE < 1, the daily production function is
concave in Mitτ and Eitτ , so Vit < 1. For small δ, Vit is decreasing in δ: more outages lead to more
productivity loss. We call this the input variation effect.
For plants without generators, MitS = EitS = 0, so vit simplifies to vit = (1−αM −αE ) ln(1−δ).
Given that ln(1 − δ) ≈ −δ, we have vit ≈ −δ(1 − αM − αE ). This illustrates that the measured
TFPR loss is the waste of all inputs when outages force the plant to shut down, net of αM + αE ,
the share of inputs that can be “turned off” during the outage.

Production Function Estimation
Static Inputs

Under the assumption of profit maximization, we use the first-order conditions to recover production
function coefficients αL , αM , and αE from yearly ASI data.20 Although the first-order conditions
derived above depend on variables that change between outage and non-outage periods and are
thus unobserved in the ASI’s annual aggregates, each can be re-arranged to obtain the usual result
that the production function coefficient equals the annual aggregate input revenue share.
The first-order condition for labor gives:

(13)

To derive αE , we re-arrange the first-order condition and take a weighted average across outage
and non-outage periods:
αE ((1 − δ)RitG + δRitS ) = (1 − δ)pE,G EitG + δpE,S EitS .

(14)

This gives
αE =

(1 − δ)pE,G EitG + δpE,S EitS

(15)

where the numerator is total expenditures on grid electricity plus fuel for self-generated electricity.21
We use median regressions to separately estimate each α parameter for each of 143 threedigit NIC industries, allowing separate linear time trends by two-digit industry. We prefer median
regressions because they are highly robust to outliers. See Online Appendix C for additional details.
III.E.2

Estimating the Capital Coefficient

It is not realistic to assume a static first-order condition for capital analogous to those for other
inputs, because capital has substantial adjustment costs and irreversibilities (Asker, Collard-Wexler,
and De Loecker 2014). Instead, we estimate αK using GMM.
We define r̃it ≡ rit − α̂L lit − α̂M mit − α̂E eit as “transformed revenue,” after netting out the
fitted contribution from labor, materials, and electricity. We then regress transformed revenue on
capital:
r̃it = αK kit + ωit .

(16)

If more productive plants invest in more capital and if productivity ωit is serially correlated,
E[ωit kit ] 6= 0 and estimation in OLS would yield an upward-biased α̂K . We thus use a standard
approach from control function estimators, exploiting the fact that capital investments take time
to plan and implement. Specifically, we assume that capital requires a one year time-to-build, so
Kit = (1 − κ)Kit−1 + I(Kit−1 , ωit−1 ), where κ represents depreciation and I(Kit−1 , ωit−1 ) represents
the investment policy function, which depends on past productivity. We allow productivity to
evolve according to a general first-order Markov process ωit = g(ωit−1 ) + ξit . Under the one-year
time-to-build assumption, the productivity innovation ξit is uncorrelated with contemporaneous
21 E,S

p
is unobserved, so we assume that pE,S is 7 Rs/kWh, reflecting the median price reported in the 2005 World
Bank Enterprise Survey.

Production Function Estimates

Table 3 presents summary statistics on the estimated production function parameters. There are 19
years of coefficients for 143 different industries, so we present the mean and 25th and 75th percentiles
of the distribution of each α. The mean labor, materials, electricity, and capital coefficients are
0.078, 0.71, 0.019, and 0.16, respectively.
The mean returns to scale coefficient is 0.96. Slightly decreasing returns to scale are common
in the production function literature; see, for instance, Collard-Wexler and De Loecker (2015). For
comparison, we also include the αK from OLS estimation of Equation (16). As predicted above,
the OLS estimates are biased slightly upward.

IV
IV.A

Estimation Strategy
Translating the Model to an Estimating Equation

The model suggests a set of outcomes that might be affected by electricity shortages. Plants
with generators will use them during outages, so shortages should be positively associated with
Self-Generation Share and Fuel Revenue Share for self-generators. Both self-generators and nongenerators will reduce electricity, materials, and labor inputs, and measured TFPR will also decrease. Revenues should decrease due to decreases in both inputs and measured TFPR.
22

We could also estimate equation (16) in OLS with first differences if we made the stronger assumption that
productivity is a random walk, i.e. ωit = ωit−1 + ξit . Thus, the purpose of the GMM procedure is to allow a more
flexible time-series process for productivity.

19

We use i, j, s, and t, respectively, to index plants, two-digit NIC industries, states, and years.
A simplified version of our estimation strategy is to regress outcomes Yijst on the CEA Shortage
variable Sst , controlling for year indicators θt , industry-by-year indicators µjt , and plant indicators
φi :
Yijst = ρSst + θt + µjt + φi + εijst .

(17)

This equation uses Shortage Sst as a proxy for the model’s outage probability δ. In reality, the
supply-demand imbalances captured by Sst are translated to plant-specific outage probabilities δ
through potentially-endogenous decisions by electricity distribution companies. For example, larger
or more productive plants may be able to secure preferential electricity access as shortages worsen.
Using Shortage instead of δ captures the “reduced form” of this process. Of course, estimates of
ρ from this equation are also “reduced form” in the sense that they are not constrained by the
assumptions of the model.23

IV.B

Instrumenting for Shortages

There are several reasons why shortages might be endogenous in Equation (17). For example,
improvements in state-level economic conditions or institutions could increase productivity and
revenue, and the resulting increase in electricity demand could cause shortages. Alternatively,
shortages could be measured with error, causing attenuation bias.
A valid instrument for shortages must shift electricity supply but affect manufacturers only
through shortages. Our instrument exploits supply shifts from hydroelectricity generation: because
hydro plants have very low physical marginal cost, their annual output depends primarily on a water
availability constraint determined by rainfall at higher elevations (or snowfall in the Himalayan
states). The instrument Zst is predicted hydro generation Hst as a share of predicted electricity
demand Q̃st :
Zst =

Hst
.
Q̃st

(18)

Because shortages directly affect actual consumption, we predict state s electricity demand
using the product of total electricity sold in all other states in year t and the sample average ratio
23

Several unmodeled effects of shortages might be relevant. First, if plants substitute production across days in
response to outages, our estimates capture this by estimating net effects of shortages over a year. Second, if shortages
reduce output quality, this will appear in revenues and/or TFPR. Third, effects on input demand are not constrained
by our yearly-flexible vs. fully-flexible categorizations or by Cobb-Douglas substitution patterns. Fourth, if inputs
or outputs are traded on local markets instead of national or international markets with exogenous prices, shortages
could affect plants through changes in other input or output prices, not just through the price and availability of
electricity.

For Hst , one option is to use actual hydroelectricity generation. In theory, however, reservoirs
can store water for future years if demand is low in the present year, which means that hydro
generation might be simultaneously determined with manufacturing production. For our primary
specification, we thus predict state-level hydro generation using reservoir inflows and generation
from “run-of-river” hydro plants that have no reservoirs to store water.
More precisely, recall that Section I introduced fdt , reservoir or plant d’s demeaned capacity
factor in year t. We get the state average capacity factor, weighting by annual generation capacity
cd and by ads ∈ [0, 1], the share of d’s output that is contractually allocated to state s. Multiplying
by C̃st , the state’s predicted annual hydro generation capacity, translates the capacity factor to
predicted hydro generation Hst . Denoting Ds as the set of reservoirs and run-of-river plants ever
observed in state s, we have:
P

cd ads fdt
.
d∈Ds cd ads

d∈Ds
Hst = C̃st · P

(20)

We predict hydro capacity C̃st using Equation (19), except with C substituted for Q. We
use predicted instead of actual hydro capacity because the latter is determined endogenously by
economic growth over the study period.
IV.B.1

Rainfall Controls

Of course, precipitation affects India’s economy in ways other than just relaxing water availability
constraints for hydroelectricity plants. To address this, we include rainfall controls in our primary
specification. We get each state’s sample average annual rainfall R̄s and include indicator variables
for five bins above and five bins below R̄s at 60 millimeter intervals. (We also present alternative
specifications with 50 millimeter bins, 100 millimeter bins, and a simple linear control.) Because
rainfall is also correlated with temperature, which also can affect manufacturers, we control for
average cooling degrees Wst .
There are three sources of variation in the hydro instrument conditional on rainfall. First, the
cross-state contracts measured by allocations ads mean that in some cases, shortages in a given state
will depend on water availability in another state. Second, rainfall in hydro plant watersheds differs
from rainfall in the same state outside of the watersheds. Half of the geographic gridpoints in our
rainfall data are not in or near a hydro plant watershed, and rainfall can vary substantially across
even small geographic regions (Dell, Jones, and Olken 2014, Auffhammer, Hsiang, Schlenker, and
Sobel 2013). Furthermore, dams are more likely to be placed in more steeply-sloped terrain (Duflo
and Pande 2007), where local rainfall variation can be especially significant (Lipscomb, Mobarak,
21

and Barham 2013).
Third, even if there were no cross-state contracts and every point in a state received the same
rainfall, the slope of the relationship between rainfall and Zst differs across states because states
capture different shares of rainfall for hydroelectricity generation. Some states, such as West
Bengal, receive relatively high rainfall but convert little into hydroelectricity. Other states, such
as Karnataka, have lower-than-average rainfall but derive a relatively large share of electricity
from hydro. The same variation in rainfall thus has a much larger effect on electricity supply in
Karnataka than in West Bengal.24

IV.C

Estimating Equation

Our empirical specification takes the intuition from Equation (17) and instruments for Sst , adding
the vector of rainfall bins Rst , cooling degree controls Wst , state-specific time trends ψs t, and also
state split indicators Λst that control for three changes in state geographic definitions:25
Yijst = ρSst + βRst + νWst + Λst + ψs t + θt + µjt + φi + εijst .

(21)

Observations are weighted by ASI sample weights. Our primary specifications use the fixed
effects estimator, although we also present estimates using the difference estimator. Because Sst
and Zst vary by state and year, errors are clustered by state-year. Our primary specifications use
two-way clustering by plant and state-year (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller 2011).26

IV.D

Discussion

Several features of the empirical strategy merit discussion. First, we include state-specific trends
ψs t because they substantially improve first stage power. They are especially important in two
robustness checks, one which uses ln(Energy Available) instead of Shortage Sst as the endogenous
variable, and another that uses actual hydro generation for Hst . Both ln(Energy Available) and
actual hydro generation have highly heterogeneous state-specific trends, the former because of
differing economic growth rates and the latter because of differing trends in the importance of
24

In fact, the first stage relationship between hydro production and shortages is clearly visible in the raw data
in Karnataka. We illustrate this in Online Appendix Figure A4. Online Appendix Figure A5 plots each state’s
sample average rainfall against the average ratio of hydro generation to total consumption; the two quantities are
uncorrelated.
25
In November 2000, three new states (Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand) were split from three existing
states (Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh). Weather, hydro plants and reservoirs, and ASI plants can be
assigned to post-2000 state definitions in all years of the sample. However, the CEA reports Shortages and other
state-level variables only for the combined state areas before 2001 or 2002 (depending on the variable). Before those
years, we assign data for the combined states to plants in either of the eventually-separate states. State split indicators
Λst take different values when a state’s geographic definition changes.
26
We do not have the downward-biased standard errors described by Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004).
They study traditional differences-in-differences estimators, in which the dependent variable of interest is serially
correlated. By contrast, Online Appendix Table A6 shows that the instrument Zst is not serially correlated. Notwithstanding, we also present robustness checks with standard errors clustered by state.

22

hydro relative to other generation sources.27 Unless they are absorbed by the ψs t controls, these
heterogeneous trends substantially reduce precision.
Second, because the estimates include year indicators, ρ measures effects of shortages Sst on
plants in state s relative to plants in other states in the same year. If there are cross-state spillover
effects, for example if customers substitute to plants in other states as production in state s is
slowed by outages, our estimates reflect some reallocation of output across states, not just a loss
of aggregate output. Thus, the estimates are relevant for state-level policymakers who want to
know how improvements in electricity supply in their state affect outcomes for their manufacturers
relative to manufacturers in other states. The estimates are informative about a national-level
supply improvement only if cross-state spillovers are relatively small.
Third, the coefficients will largely be identified by states with more variation in hydro generation,
which tend to also be the states where hydro represents a large share of total supply. While
some hydro-heavy states are small mountainous areas such as Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and
Uttarakhand, other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa, and Punjab are
both large and rely heavily on hydroelectricity.28
Fourth, the empirical estimates will primarily reflect short-run effects. Because of the plant
fixed effects φi , the ρ parameter reflects impacts of shortages only on continuing plants. Entry,
exit, and even generator adoption or resale are unlikely responses to variation in shortages Sst
driven by year-to-year variation in hydro availability Zst .

IV.E

Evaluating the Instrument with State-Level Data

Table 4 evaluates the instrument. All regressions are analogues to the first stage, regressing a
dependent variable on the hydro instrument Zst , controlling for weather Rst and Wst , state trends
ψs t, year indicators θt , and state split controls Λst . These regressions are estimated at the stateby-year level, with observations weighted by the number of ASI establishments. Column 1 presents
the direct analogue to the first stage, showing that a one percentage point increase in instrumented
supply decreases shortages by 0.177 percentage points. The fact that the coefficient is smaller
than one (in absolute value) implies that states partially offset an increase in supply by decreasing
generation from other sources and by importing less from or exporting more to other states.
For an instrument to be valid, it must shift supply without affecting manufacturing other than
through shortages. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 4 present evidence that this is the case. Recall that the
CEA separately reports the two components of shortages: Assessed Demand and Energy Available.
27

Online Appendix Figures A6 and A7 illustrate this. For example, the economy in Andhra Pradesh grows rapidly
over the study period, while Uttar Pradesh grows relatively slowly. Residual of year effects θt , ln(Energy Available)
trends steeply downward in Uttar Pradesh and steeply upward in Andhra Pradesh. For hydro generation, states such
as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have relatively steep downward trends in the share of consumption supplied by
hydro, while states such as Gujarat and West Bengal have small and relatively flat hydro generation over the study
period. Thus, residual of year effects θt , the instrument constructed with actual hydro generation slopes steeply
downward in Karnataka and steeply upward in West Bengal.
28
Online Appendix Figure A5 and Table A4 present more detail.

23

Column 2 shows that Energy Available is associated with the instrument, but column 3 shows that
Assessed Demand is not. It is difficult to conceive of a story under which the exclusion restriction
is violated but the instrument is not associated with electricity demand. Column 4 provides further
evidence on this, showing that agricultural output is not associated with the instrument (conditional
on rainfall).

If supply shocks affected electricity prices instead of shortages, this would be equally interesting
but should be interpreted differently. Column 5 regresses the median electricity price paid by ASI
plants in each state and year on the instrument, finding no statistically significant correlation. This
confirms that that when hydro production shifts supply, distribution companies clear the market
by adjusting outages, not by adjusting prices.

Empirical Results

First Stages

Table 5 presents first stage estimates. There are two panels of estimates, corresponding to two
groups of outcomes: energy inputs and then materials, labor, revenue, and TFPR. Regressions
with Self-Generation Share and ln(Fuel Revenue Share) include only the 54 percent of plants in the
2005 ASI that ever self-generate electricity, because Self-Generation Share is mechanically zero for
non-generators, and our model similarly predicts zero impact of outages on Fuel Revenue Share for
non-generators.29 For this reason, and also because of missing data and outlier flags, the sample
sizes differ across columns.
While the exact coefficient estimates differ slightly due to the different samples, the estimates
across all columns are very similar to each other and to the state-level estimates in column 1 of
Table 4. The instruments are powerful: the cluster and heteroskedasticity-robust Kleibergen-Paap
F-statistics range from 14 to 17. For comparison, the Stock and Yogo (2005) critical values for one

V.B.1

Effects of Shortages
Energy Inputs

Table 6 presents estimates of Equation (21) for energy inputs. Panels A and B present OLS and
instrumental variables results, respectively. The IV estimates show that a one percentage point increase in Shortage (for example, an increase from 0.1 to 0.11) causes manufacturers to increase the
share of electricity self-generated by 0.442 percentage points. If manufacturing electricity demand
were fully inelastic and shortages mapped one-for-one into increases in outages δ for manufacturers,
then the coefficient on Shortage in column 1 would be one. However, plants with generators will
substitute away from electricity through the input tax effect, and electricity distribution companies may impose more or less of the marginal shortage on manufacturers instead of agricultural,
residential, or other consumers.

25

The IV estimate in column 2 shows that a one percentage point increase in Shortage increases
fuel revenue share by 3.294 percent. Using the fact that the mean fuel revenue share is 0.055, the
point estimate suggests that a one percentage point increase in shortages increases fuel costs by
(3.294×1%) × 0.055 ≈0.18 percent of revenues. Even a large shortage increase thus imposes only a
relatively small fuel cost increase to plants with generators - and this is largely offset by a decrease
in purchased electricity costs.
Can plants become less electricity-intensive, in the short-run, as electricity becomes scarce?
Column 3 shows that on average, the answer is no: shortages do not statistically affect the ratio of
physical electricity use to revenue. The standard errors rule out that the average plant responds
to a one percentage point increase in shortages by reducing electric intensity by more than about
1.5 percent.
The OLS point estimates differ from the IV estimates, and the directions are consistent with two
biases hypothesized earlier: simultaneity bias (economic growth causes shortages) and measurement
error. Self-Generation Share is less subject to the former bias, as it is not clear that economic growth
would have any direct effect on this variable. The fact that the OLS point estimates are smaller
than the IV estimates suggests that instrumenting helps slightly to address attenuation bias. The
variables in columns 2-3, however, are ratios to revenues, which increase with economic growth.
The coefficients are thus strongly downward biased.

Non-Energy Inputs, Revenue, and TFPR

Table 7 presents effects of shortages on non-energy inputs, revenue, and revenue productivity.
Column 1-3 measure impacts on materials and labor. Column 1 shows that a one percentage point
increase in Shortage causes a 1.137 percent decrease in materials input. Column 2 shows that
shortages do not statistically affect labor input, as measured by total persons ever employed during
the year. This is not entirely surprising, since our instrument captures year-to-year variation in
shortages that might not be observed by the plant at the time it hires labor. Even though plants
might not be able to reduce their number of workers, they might reduce hours worked in response
to shortages. However, column 3 confirms that plants are unable to reduce earnings per worker as
shortages worsen. This suggests that materials inputs tend to be determined after plants recognize
electricity supply shifts - perhaps on a day-to-day basis - while labor input is less flexible.

Columns 4 and 5 present effects on log revenue r and log TFPR ω, respectively. The IV estimates
in column 4 show that a one percentage point increase in shortages causes a 1.091 percent decrease
in revenues. In the special case distribution companies impose the marginal shortage proportionally
to manufacturers vs. other consumers, no plants self-generate, plants have no yearly-flexible inputs,
and δ is small, this coefficient would be approximately one - for example, an increase in shortages
from 0 to 0.01 would reduce revenue by one percent. In reality, some plants have generators, which
attenuates the revenue effects, while all plants can reduce yearly-flexible inputs, which magnifies
the revenue effects.
Column 5 shows that shortages have statistically zero effect on log TFPR, with a 90-percent
confidence interval from -0.69 to 0.085 percent. Given the standard errors, a statistically zero

27

effect is exactly what the model predicts. For plants without generators, Equation (11) predicts a
ln(TFPR) loss of vit = (1 − αM − αE ) ln(1 − δ). As shown in Table 3, the mean αM and αE are 0.71
and 0.019, respectively. Thus, a one percentage point increase in δ would reduce non-generators’
TFPR by approximately (1-0.71-0.019)× 1% ≈ 0.27%, and the effect on self-generators’ TFPR
should be smaller. In Section VI, we show that our point estimate of -0.304 is very close to the
simulated model prediction.
The model also predicts that the ln(TFPR) loss is weakly smaller than the ln(revenue) loss,
because the revenue loss equals the TFPR loss plus losses from reductions in yearly-flexible and
fully-flexible inputs. The point estimates in columns 4 and 5 bear this out. Statistically, the TFPR
coefficient in column 5 is less negative than the revenue coefficient in column 4 with a p-value of
0.077 in a one-sided test and 0.15 in a two-sided test.
Comparing the OLS estimates in Panel A to the IV estimates in Panel B strongly suggests
simultaneity bias. All input, output, and TFPR coefficients are positively biased relative to the IV
estimates, suggesting that the improved economic conditions that increase shortages also increase
wages, productivity, and revenue. Without instrumenting for shortages, one might falsely conclude
that shortages are good for manufacturers.

V.C

Robustness Checks

Tables 6 and 7 are highly robust to a battery of robustness checks and alternative specifications.
Here we present the overview; see Online Appendix E for details.
Estimates are very similar and statistically indistinguishable when using the difference estimator, omitting industry-by-year controls µjt , eliminating or tightening the criteria for dropping
outliers, or using the CEA’s estimated Peak Shortage or supply (i.e. ln(Energy Available)) instead
of Shortage as the endogenous right-hand-side variable. The fact that using supply instead of Shortage as the endogenous variable gives similar estimates is unsurprising, because as shown in Table 4,
the instrument affects only supply, not demand. It is reassuring, however, because unlike Shortage,
Energy Available does not rely on the CEA’s assessment of counterfactual demand. The similarly
in results suggests that the Shortage variable does not suffer from some non-classical measurement
error that an instrumental variable cannot address. Clustering by state instead of using two-way
clustering only mildly changes the standard errors; no discrete significance levels change, and no
first-stage F-statistic drops below 10.
Estimates are economically similar and statistically indistinguishable when using linear rainfall
or 100mm or 50mm rainfall bins instead of 60mm bins, or when using rainfall data from the National
Climate Centre instead of University of Delaware. Estimates are statistically indistinguishable
when constructing the instrument with actual hydro generation for Hst instead the prediction from
reservoirs and run-of-river plants, except that the Self-Generation Share coefficient is statistically
larger and the ln(Electric Intensity) coefficient is statistically negative. This latter result suggests
that plants may indeed become less electric intensive as electricity shortages worsen. Finally,

28

results are qualitatively similar under six different approaches to calculating production functions
and TFPR.

V.D

Associations with Longer-Term Shortage Variation

Our main IV results identify the effects of year-to-year shortage variation. How do shortages affect
manufacturers in the long run? Rigorous causal evidence is challenging, because we do not have a
plausible instrument for long-run shortage variation. This section addresses long-run effects using
correlational evidence.
Specifically, we test how shortages preceding the year of entry are associated with entrant plants’
technology choices. Define Yijst as an outcome for plant i which enters in year t, and define ζs as
state-specific indicator variables. S̄st is the average of Shortage in state s in year t and the one year
before; this proxies for potential entrants’ beliefs about future shortages. Averaging over two years
both reduces measurement error and smooths over idiosyncratic year-to-year variation that should
not impact potential entrants’ beliefs about future shortages. We run the following regression with
plant-level data:
Yijst = ρS̄st + Λst + ζs + θt + µjt + st

(22)

Standard errors are clustered by state.
Table 8 presents results. Column 1 considers the industry average electric intensity, i.e. the
average ratio of electricity use to revenues for all plants in the same three-digit industry as plant
i. (This column excludes industry-by-year indicators µjt .) For readability, electric intensity is
normalized to units of kWh per 100 Rupees of revenue; the mean is 1.35 kWh/100 Rupees. A
negative coefficient would imply that plants in electricity-intensive industries are less likely to enter
when shortages are higher. This would be predicted by an extension of our model in Section III in
the direction of Melitz (2003), in which potential entrant plants decide whether to enter based on
expectations of δ and their productivity shock Ωit . For each expected δ and production technology
α, there is a cutoff productivity Ω(δ, α) above which plants will enter. An increase in δ reduces
profitability more (and thus increases Ω(δ, α) more) for self-generators in industries with high αE ,
because more self-generation causes larger cost increases when αE is large. Thus, an increase in
expected shortages should reduce entry more for higher-αE industries, reducing entrants’ overall
average electric intensity. Indeed, the point estimate shows that a one percentage point increase in
shortages is associated with a 0.00463 kWh/Rs decrease in the industry-level electric intensity of
entrant plants, or about 0.34 percent of the mean.
Higher shortages should also increase the return to generator ownership. Indeed, Column 2
shows that shortages in the entry year S̄st are positively associated with higher generator ownership
rates for entrants. This association is small, however: a one percentage point increase in shortages
is associated with a 0.246 percentage point increase in generator ownership. Such a small coefficient
is quite remarkable: generator ownership rates vary substantially across states, ranging from a low

near 10 percent in some lower-income states to more than 80 percent in Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi,
and Haryana. Column 2 suggests that little of this variation is driven by state average shortages.
Aside from the generator adoption and extensive margin choices, entrant plants can also choose
production technologies. Columns 3-5 test whether shortages at the time of entry are associated
with entrants’ factor shares.30 Theory gives no unambiguous prediction about whether shortages
should increase or decrease various factor shares. For example, higher shortages increase generator
adoption, which mechanically increases capital stock. On the other hand, higher shortages also
decrease expected capital utilization, especially for non-generators, and this could cause them to
switch to a less capital-intensive technology. Column 3 shows that a one percentage point increase
in shortages is associated with a marginally significant 0.7 percent decrease in capital intensity.
As predicted, additional (unreported) regressions shows that the negative association is stronger
(ρ̂ = −0.96) for non-generators. Columns 4 and 5 show that labor and materials shares are not
associated with S̄st .

Simulations
Overview

In this section we apply the model in Section III to the plants and production function parameters in the Annual Survey of Industries data. There are several objectives. First, we simulate
effects of shortages and test whether they line up with the estimates in Section V. Second, we
simulate heterogeneous effects of shortages, which we do not have the power to detect empirically.
Third, we simulate a counterfactual policy, offering interruptible electricity contracts, which could
substantially reduce the effects of shortages.
30

Specifically, these are the natural log of the ratio of average input to average revenue, where the averages are
taken across all years a plant is observed. The logs help to reduce the influence of outliers, which is the same role
that median regressions play when estimating the production function parameters α in Section III.E.

30

The simulations consider the population of plants that appear in the ASI in 2005.31 Each plant
is characterized by estimated production function parameters α and exogenous state variables
Ki2005 , Ωi2005 , and generator ownership. For the price ratio of grid-purchased to self-generated
electricity, we use the World Bank Enterprise Survey medians: pE,S /pE,G = 7/4.5 ≈ 1.56. Given
this information and an assumed δ, we simulate production decisions using the first-order conditions
in Section III. See Online Appendix F for more details on the simulation procedure.
For the next several subsections until Section VI.E, our reported “effects of shortages” reflect
a change from δ = 0 to δ = Ss2005 , the CEA estimated Shortage in the plant’s state in 2005. The
mean Ss2005 across all plants observed in 2005 is 7.2 percent. Although we have shown that the
variation in Sst is meaningful for empirical estimates, we caution that this official assessment is a
highly imperfect proxy for the level of Indian manufacturers’ true outage probability δ.
To more closely match our empirical estimates, we weight by each plant’s sampling weight and
report the weighted average simulated effect of the change in δ. This is different than reporting
output-weighted effects, which might be informative about aggregate sectoral implications. As we
discuss below, output-weighted effects on most outcomes would be smaller, because the largest
plants are much more likely to own generators.
VI.A.1

Modeling Generator Adoption

We model the decision to purchase a generator as a binary choice: either a plant owns a generator
that is large enough to provide full backup during a power outage, or it does not own a generator.
Because the ASI does not include data on generator capacity, we construct a back-of-the-envelope
estimate of each plant’s capacity requirement: we transform a plant’s total electricity consumption
Eit (in kilowatt-hours) into required generation capacity assuming that plants use a constant flow
of power while operating an average of six hours per day.32 Under this assumption, the median
generator capacity requirement is 500 kilowatts.
We model that a plant will purchase a generator if the simulated variable profit increase exceeds
the cost. The simulated variable profit increase is just the simulated profits with vs. without
a generator, given the plant’s α, Ki2005 , Ωi2005 , and an outage probability δ. We assume that
generator cost C G (ci ) is log-linear in plant i’s required capacity ci , i.e. ln C G (ci ) = σ0 + σ1 ln(ci ).
We estimate σ0 and σ1 in GMM using the 1(Self-Generator) variable from the ASI and assuming
δ = Sst , matching mean generator adoption and also the covariance between generator adoption
and ln(ci ). Estimates reflect strong economies of scale in generator costs: the estimated σ1 is 0.83
(se=0.01), and this is statistically and economically similar to direct quotes of generator purchase
costs. The estimated intercept σ0 is also comparable to direct price quotes, implying that fixed
31

We chose 2005 because it allows comparison to the 2005 World Bank Enterprise Survey and because the assessed
shortages are close to average: over the 1992-2010 sample, the average nationwide shortage ranged from 6.4 to 11.1
percent, and the mean reported in Table 1 is 7.6 percent. Online Appendix Figure A8 presents predicted revenue
losses when simulating with each year between 1992 and 2010, showing that 2005 is not unusual.
32
Changing this assumption about the number of operating hours per day would only rescale our generator cost
estimates; the simulation predictions would otherwise be unchanged.

31

costs are large enough to explain why so many Indian plants do not have generators. See Online
Appendix VI.A.1 for details.

VI.B.1

Effect of Shortages
Comparing Empirical Estimates to Short-Run Simulations

Panel A of Table 9 presents the effects of changing δ from zero to Ss,2005 on average revenue,
TFPR, self-generation share, material and labor inputs. Column 1 presents “exogenous generator
simulations,” i.e. simulated short-run effects holding fixed the generator ownership observed in
the ASI. This is appropriate for comparison to the IV estimates because the instrument uses
annual electricity supply shifters, and plants are unlikely to have responded by adopting or selling
generators. Column 2 adds predictions based on the instrumental variable estimates: the predicted
effects of a 7.2 percent shortage given the IV point estimates in Tables 6 and 7.33 Column 3 presents
the p-value of a test that the simulation result differs from the IV estimate.
There is remarkable agreement between the empirical estimates and simulation results. Average
revenue losses are 5.6 percent in the simulations and 7.7 percent from the IV. Both the simulations
and IV predict that TFPR losses are much smaller than revenue losses, with predictions of 1.5
percent and 2.2 percent from the simulations and IV, respectively. Given that the TFPR effect is
relatively small, the decrease in revenues must be caused by decreased input use. This is indeed
the case: the model predicts a 5.6 percent decrease in materials and labor, respectively, while the
IV estimates show 8.1 and 1.7 percent decreases. The simulated and estimated increases in SelfGeneration Share also line up closely. Column 3 shows that the simulation and IV estimates are
highly statistically indistinguishable except for the effects on labor input, which has a p-value of
0.11. The model assumes that labor is set with knowledge of the current year’s shortage; if workers
are instead hired before the effects of new power plant capacity or hydro availability are known,
this would explain the difference between the estimated and simulated effects.
Column 4 presents self-reported revenue losses from the 2005 World Bank Enterprise Survey; this
number is closely comparable to the simulation and IV estimates. Overall, the close correspondence
between our model and estimates using different datasets and identification strategies gives us
confidence in the empirical estimates as well as our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
VI.B.2

Effects for Generators and Non-Generators

Panel B of Table 9 presents effects of the same change in δ (from zero to Ss2005 ) on producer
surplus separately for plants with vs. without generators. Producer surplus is relevant because
under our modeling assumption that output markets are perfectly competitive and there are no
33
Because the empirical estimates are identified off of relatively modest annual variation, column 2 is not a realistic
estimate of the long-run effects of eliminating shortages. Online Appendix Table A21 shows very similar agreement
between simulated and estimated results when comparing in terms of semi-elasticities, i.e. the effects of a one
percentage point change in shortage.

32

other market failures, the change in producer surplus is equivalent to overall welfare effects. We
decompose producer surplus loss into generator fixed costs and variable profit changes, including
the component due to decreases in measured TFPR. We compute fixed costs of generators observed
in the 2005 ASI by applying estimated generator costs σˆ0 and σˆ1 to required capacity ci , and we
assume for simplicity that no plants would own generators in the scenario with δ = 0. We find
that generator costs amount to 7.7 percent of profit losses for plants with generators, or 3.9 percent
when averaged across all plants.
The simulations predict very different effects on plants with vs. without generators. Plants
with generators lose only 0.3 percent of variable profits. They lose no output to shutdown; all
revenue losses come from the decrease in the marginal products of materials and labor due to
higher-cost self-generated electricity. The decrease is small because this implicit tax is small:
given that electricity costs increase by 55 percent when self-generating, electricity has a 5 percent
revenue share, and Ss2005 averages 7.2 percent, the weighted average input cost rises by only about
55%×5%×7.2%≈0.2 percent of revenues.
In contrast, variable profits fall by 10 percent for the average plant without a generator. This
effect is larger than the 7.2 percent of the time when the plants shut down, because the input
tax effect magnifies the effect of shortages: expected power outages reduce the expected marginal
revenue product of the semi-flexible input (labor) by δ, causing plants to reduce labor input.
The bottom row of Panel B shows that predicted effects on measured TFPR are also very
different for non-generators vs. self-generators: 2.6 percent vs. almost zero, respectively, with an
average over all plants of 1.5 percent. Recall that for plants with generators, the TFPR loss is
due to the input variation effect: with a concave daily production function, it would have been
more efficient to produce with a constant input bundle instead of different input bundles during
outage vs. non-outage periods. This input variation effect is so small because plants do not reduce
production very much during outages given the small implicit input tax.
By contrast, the TFPR loss for non-generators is much larger. To understand the magnitude,
recall from the model that measured TFPR loss vit ≈ −δ(1 − αM − αE ). In the limiting case with
no fully flexible inputs, shutting down 7.2 percent of the time would cause a 7.2 percent TFPR loss.
In another extreme with αM + αE = 1, there is also no TFPR loss, because with constant return
to scale in the daily production function the plant could costlessly shift production to a non-outage
day. In the data, the average αE + αM is 0.73, and the simulations predict a TFPR loss is 2.6
percent for the average plant without a generator.34
34
Online Appendix E.F presents empirical estimates of how generator ownership moderates effects of shortages; we
do not have the power to detect differences between plants with vs. without generators. Notice that such empirical
estimates would likely understate the average causal effects of generator ownership because generator adoption is
endogenous, so plants without generators will tend to have unobservably smaller losses. For example, plants with
unobservably better electricity supply are both less likely to adopt generators and potentially less affected by an
increase in shortages.

VI.C

Counterfactual with Interruptible Contracts

Given that 44 percent of manufacturing plants have generators, this “distributed generation” provides production capacity that would optimally be exploited when power is scarce. Currently, there
are plants that have generators but do not use them because they receive grid power, while other
nearby plants without generators simultaneously experience outages. Interruptible electricity contracts offer manufacturers and other electricity consumers a rebate for accepting outages during
times of scarcity. If distribution companies offer both uninterruptible and interruptible contracts
and allow consumers to sort into their preferred contract, this provides a mechanism to allocate
outages to plants that are least affected.35
We simulate the effects of allowing plants to select into one of two electricity supply contracts,
an uninterruptible contract with no outages and an interruptible contract that will allow outages
14.4 percent of the time - twice the assessed national average outage rate. The market-clearing
rebate for the interruptible contract is pinned down by the maximum profit loss among the plants
comprising 50 percent of manufacturers’ grid electricity consumption. When this 50 percent of
consumption is interrupted 14.2 percent of the time, this allows the uninterruptible contracts to
be fulfilled. Panel C of Table 9 presents the effects of shortages under this contract structure.
Because larger plants are more likely to have generators and are thus willing to accept interruptible
contracts at lower rebates, only eight percent of plants need to opt into the interruptible contract
to clear the market. Under this counterfactual policy, shortages of δ = Ss2005 instead of δ = 0
reduce variable profits by 0.4 percent, more than an order of magnitude less than the 5.6 percent
loss when outages are evenly distributed within states. With interruptible contracts, there is no
noticeable decrease in TFPR.
There are two important caveats to this analysis. First, it holds constant the manufacturing
sector’s total power allocation. In practice, the grid electricity conserved through interruptible
contracts with manufacturers could be allocated to homes, agriculture, or other sectors, where the
marginal social value of electricity could be different. Second, even holding constant the manufacturing power allocation, we do not observe which specific plants are subject to shortages, so the
losses without interruptible contracts could be larger or smaller than we simulate here.

VI.D

Comparing Effects for Large vs. Small Plants

How do shortages differentially affect small vs. large plants? Panel (a) of Figure 4 shows that
the share of plants that report self-generating electricity increases with plant size. The figure
reflects the same economy of scale in generator ownership discussed above. Because outages more
severely affect plants without generators, this economy of scale makes small plants more exposed
to outages than large plants. The solid line in Panel (b) of Figure 4 illustrates this, showing
35

Interruptible contracts have been studied by Baldick, Kolos, and Tompaidis (2006) and are common in the U.S.
They are more suitable for large electricity consumers such as manufacturing plants, because a fixed cost is required
to install switches to turn off electricity to the specific establishment.

35

the relationship between employment and the predicted variable profit loss from shortages in the
exogenous generator simulation. While the average ten-employee plant is predicted to lose about six
percent of profits, the average 100-employee plant loses only about two percent. These differences
between large and small plants are driven entirely by differential generator ownership: the dashed
line in Panel (b) shows that the predicted profit losses would be roughly constant in plant size in
an alternative simulation in which no plants have generators.

VI.E

Effects of Shortages with Endogenous Generator Adoption

Given that generators moderate the effects of shortages, increased shortages should increase generator adoption. How much does this moderate the producer surplus losses from shortages? Figure
5 plots the effects of raising all plants’ δ from zero to a homogeneous δ up to 0.2, as listed on
the x-axis. Panel (a) uses the “exogenous generator simulations,” while Panel (b) uses “endogenous generator simulations,” which endogenize generator adoption at the given δ using the model
detailed above in Section VI.A.1.36
In the exogenous generator simulation in Panel (a), the variable profit losses increase approximately linearly from zero to 18 percent as shortages worsen from zero to 20 percent. Since generator
capital stock is held fixed in this simulation, the fixed cost of generators is invariant to shortages
at 2.9 percent.
Panel (b) illustrates a starkly different pattern when generator ownership is endogenously adjusted. As shortages worsen, the variable profit loss peaks at 1.7 percent with a three percent
shortage, drops slightly, and approaches only 1.5 percent as shortages approach 20 percent. The
reason for this non-monotonicity is that many plants adopt generators at low levels of δ, and for
these low δ, generator adoption more than offsets the “direct effect” of an increase in δ. Once δ is
large and most plants have generators, the effects of shortages rise relatively slowly with increases
in δ. Generator investments are costly, however, and at a 20 percent shortage, generator fixed
costs decrease profits by 4.2 percent. Thus, as shortages worsen, the cost of shortages increasingly
consists of the cost of purchasing backup generators.

Conclusion

India’s lack of reliable electricity supply is a stark example of how poor infrastructure might affect
economic growth. But while the problem is apparent, there had been no quantification of the resulting losses, making it difficult to prioritize relative to other economic distortions. We estimate the
effects of shortages on manufacturers using archival data on shortages, instrumenting for shortages
with supply shifts from hydro availability.
There are four main conclusions. First, we estimate that shortages are a substantial drag on
Indian manufacturing, reducing revenue by 5.6 percent (in the simulations) to 8.6 percent (in the
IV estimates) for the average plant in the short run. Producer surplus drops by 9.5 percent for
the average plant, of which 3.9 percent is due to the capital costs of backup generators. Second,
because plants also reduce inputs in response to shortages, shortages affect productivity much less
than they affect revenue. Thus, the short-run effects of electricity shortages do not explain much of
the productivity gap between firms in developing vs. developed countries discussed by Banerjee and
Duflo (2005), Hall and Jones (1999), Hsieh and Klenow (2009), and others, although the long-run
effects could be different. Third, because shortages more strongly affect plants without generators
and there are substantial economies of scale in generator costs, shortages more severely affect
small plants. This adds another distortion to the firm size distribution in developing countries,
related to the discussion of Hsieh and Olken (2014), Tybout (2000), and others. Fourth, policy can
help: interruptible contracts or similar mechanisms can substantially reduce the costs of shortages.
Because such contracts can be offered at a discount on an opt-in basis, they may be more politically
feasible than raising prices or changing allocations.

Power Sector Data Appendix

This appendix provides additional details on the power sector data in Section I.B.
Appendix Table A2 presents the state allocations from jointly-owned power plants.
Appendix Table A3 presents summary statistics for the reservoir and hydro plant microdata.
Panel A presents the reservoir microdata; 31 reservoirs ever appear. A reservoir scheme may
include multiple hydro plants, so generation and generation capacity are for all plants within the
reservoir scheme. All reservoir data are missing for the year 2000, so inflows are imputed using
rainfall at gridpoints within the reservoir watershed. For each reservoir, we then run a regression
of generation on inflows; the fitted values are then divided by generation capacity and transformed
into a predicted capacity factor.
Panel B of Appendix Table A3 presents the hydro plant microdata; 181 plants ever appear, of
which 18 percent (32 plants) are known to be run-of-river plants. All plant-level data are missing
for the year 1992, and generation data are occasionally missing in other years. Just less than
six percent of generation observations are imputed using rainfall at gridpoints within the plant’s
watershed.
Appendix Table A4 presents summary statistics on electricity supply for the ten largest states.
Figures A1, A2, A3 present maps of shortage severity, hydro power plants and weather stations,
and four example hydro plant watersheds, respectively.

Annual Survey of Industries Data Appendix

This appendix presents additional information on the Annual Survey of Industries data.
We extract a subset of variables from the raw data separately for each year and then stack all
years of data together to apply the following cleaning processes.37 We correct observations in 199394 to 1997-98 whose values have been supplied in “pre-multiplied” format from the India’s Ministry
of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). We create a separate consistently-defined
state variable which takes into account the creation of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal
(now Uttarakhand) in 2001 from Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. We
assign establishments to the last observed state, which correctly places establishments despite state
splits, as long as the establishment is surveyed after 2001.
India classifies manufacturing establishments with its National Industrial Classification (NIC),
which resembles industrial classifications commonly used in other countries. The classifications
were revised in 1987, 1998, 2004, and 2008. We convert all industry classifications to the NIC-1987
scheme using concordances provided by MOSPI.
All financial amounts are deflated to constant 2004-05 Rupees. Revenue (gross sales) is deflated
by a three-digit commodity price deflators as available in the commodity-based table “Index Numbers Of Wholesale Prices In India – By Groups And Sub-Groups (Yearly Averages)” produced by
the Office of the Economic Adviser-Ministry of Commerce & Industry.38 Each three-digit NIC-1987
code is assigned to a commodity listed in this table. The corresponding commodity deflator is used
to deflate revenues. To deflate material inputs, we construct the average output deflator of a given
industry’s supplier industries based on India’s 1993-94 input-output table, available from the Central Statistical Organization. Fuel and electricity costs are deflated by the price index for “Fuel,
Power, Light, and Lubricants.” Capital is deflated by an implied national deflator calculated from
“Table 13: Sector-wise Gross Capital Formation” from the Reserve Bank of India’s Handbook of
Statistics on the Indian Economy.39 Electricity costs are deflated using a national GDP deflator.
The sampling rules have changed somewhat over time. The census scheme included factories
with 100 or more workers in all years except 1997-2003, when it included only factories with 200
or more workers. The sample scheme included one-third of factories until 2004 and one-fifth since
then (MOSPI 2014).
The ASI data have at least two well-known shortcomings. First, while the data are representative of small registered factories and a 100 percent sample of large registered factories, not all
factories are actually registered under the Factories Act. Nagaraj (2002) shows that only 48 percent and 43 percent of the number of manufacturing establishments in the 1980 and 1990 economic
37

read-in of 1992-1997 ASI data, and Olivier Dupriez for similarly helpful discussions and pointing us to

(http://catalog.ihsn.org/index.php/catalog/central).

censes appear in the ASI data for those years. Although it is not clear how our results might
differ for unregistered plants, the plants that are observed in the ASI are still a significant share of
plants in India. Second, value added may be under-reported, perhaps associated with tax evasion,
by using accounting loopholes to overstate input costs or under-state revenues (Nagaraj 2002). As
long as changes in this under-reporting are not correlated with electricity shortages, this will not
affect our results.

C.A

Determination of Base Sample

Appendix Table A5 details how the sample in Panel B of Table 1 is determined from the original set
of observations in the ASI. The 1992-2010 ASI dataset begins with 949,992 plant-year observations.
Plants may still appear in the data even if they are closed or did not provide a survey response. We
drop 172,697 plants reported as closed or non-responsive. We drop a trivial number of observations
missing state identifiers and observations in Sikkim, which has only been included in the ASI
sampling frame in the most recent years. We drop 45,664 observations reporting non-manufacturing
NIC codes. We remove a small number of observations (primarily in the early years of our sample)
which are exact duplicates in all fields, assuming these are erroneous multiple entries made from the
same questionnaire form. Due to the importance of revenue and productivity results, we remove
the 102,036 observations with missing revenues. We also drop the 9,095 observations with two or
more input revenue share flags, from the flagging process described below.
With this intermediate sample, we use median regression to estimate revenue productivity
(TFPR) under a full Cobb-Douglas model in capital, labor, materials, and energy and assuming
constant returns to scale. This full Cobb-Douglas revenue productivity term is used only for the
final sample restriction, which is to drop 4,521 plant-years which have log-TFPR greater than 3.5 in
absolute value from the sample median. Such outlying TFPR values strongly suggest misreported
inputs or revenues. The final sample includes 615,721 plant-year observations, of which 362,151 are
from the sample scheme and 253,570 are from the census scheme.

C.B

Variable-Specific Sample Restrictions

After the final sample is determined, there may still be observations which have correct data for
most variables but misreported data for some individual variable. When analyzing specific variables
(such as self-generation share, energy revenue share, or output in Table 6), we therefore additionally
restrict the sample using the following criteria:
• We generate “input revenue share flags” for labor and materials if input cost is more than
two times revenues, and we generate input revenue share flags for electricity and fuels if input
cost is greater than revenues.40 Because we also observe physical quantities for labor and
40
The flags would be slightly different if applied to deflated inputs and revenues, but this will have minimal
implications for the results.

determined from the original set of

electricity, we generate analogous input revenue share flags by multiplying physical quantities
by prices, resulting in an implied revenue share based on these physical quantities. For
electricity, we use the median real price (in Rs/kWh) of purchased electricity in any given
state and year. For labor, we assume a very conservative 1,000 Rs per person per annum
wage rate. When using either of these inputs as an outcome, we omit observations with an
input revenue share flag for that input.
• There are a trivial number of observations which report unrealistic count of workers (greater
than 200,000 persons engaged), which we make missing in those cases.
• We generate “within-plant outlier” flags for observations with unrealistically large year-toyear fluctuations in revenue, TFPR, or any input. We flag observations if the change in logged
value is more than 3.5 (or 1.5 in a robustness check) from both adjacent observations. For a
plants’ first or last year, an observation is flagged if the change is more than 3.5 (or 1.5) from
the subsequent or previous observation.
C.B.1

Cleaning Electricity Variables

We clean plant electricity measures in the following ways:
• We make electricity consumption missing for all observations (other than brick kilns) that
report zero electricity consumption.
• We make all electricity variables missing if the plant reports consuming more than 110 percent
or less than 90 percent of the total amount of electricity they report purchasing and generating.
• We make missing the values of electricity purchased and sold if the implied price per kilowatthour is less than 2 percent or more than 5,000 percent of the median grid electricity price

55

calculated across plants in the same state and year. We also make missing the reported
quantities of electricity purchased and sold if the respective price flag is triggered.
C.B.2

Production Function and Productivity Estimation

We recover production function coefficients given by Equations (12), (13), and (15) for each of
the 143 three-digit industries in the dataset. (To ensure sufficient sample size in each three-digit
industry, we adjust industry definitions slightly to ensure each three-digit industry has at least 100
plant-year observations.) We use separate median regression for each two-digit industry, allowing
for a linear time trend and separate intercepts for each underlying three-digit industry. After
calculating production function coefficients, we compute TFPR using Equation (11).
For our main TFPR estimates, we define materials to be the plant’s original reported materials
plus fuels not used for self-generation. This latter variable is: Total Fuel Cost - (7 Rs/kWh)×(kWh
Self-Generated), where 7 Rs/kWh is the median price reported in the 2005 World Bank Enterprise
Survey. This allows us to account for the plant’s full input costs when calculating production
function parameters and TFPR. (In regressions where we use materials as the outcome variable,
we use the original reported materials without adding any fuel costs.)
We use several alternative methods for calculating production function coefficients and TFPR
for robustness checks, seen in Appendix Table A16. In the order of that table, these are:
• Including or excluding all fuel costs from the materials variable
• Removing the linear time trend when estimating production coefficients, which amounts to
taking the unconditional median revenue share by industry
• Relaxing the assumption that factor shares are constant by plant size, allowing all production
function coefficients to vary by plant median ln(Revenue). To implement, we add ln(Revenue)
as a term in the median regressions for αL , αM , and αE and then segment plants into five
size classes when estimating αK in GMM.
• Backing out the capital coefficient αK under an assumption of constant returns to scale
• Assuming production is Leontief in electricity and calculating the capital coefficient under an
assumption of constant returns to scale. (This is the approach in our original working paper.)
None of these changes affects the estimated coefficient by more than about half of the standard
error.

Robustness Checks for Tables 6 and 7

This appendix presents robustness checks for Tables 6 and 7. We first present estimates from the
difference estimator. We then present a series of robustness checks for the fixed effects estimator,
including alternative weather controls, alternative instruments, and alternative constructions of
TFPR.

E.A

Estimates with Difference Estimator

Tables A7, A8, and A9 are analogous to Tables 5, 6, and 7, except that they use the difference
estimator. Mechanically, we difference each variable within-plant and run OLS regressions with the
differenced observations; the sample sizes thus differ from the fixed effects estimates. Note that
the initial and final years of a differenced observation are not necessarily one year apart due to the
irregularly-spaced ASI sample.

Robustness Checks

This section presents robustness checks for Tables 6 and 7. Tables are organized separately for
each of the main outcomes for ease of comparison. Column 1 excludes industry-by-year effects
µjt . Column 2 uses a tolerance of 1.5 natural logs in the outlier flagging process described in
Online Appendix C.B, while column 3 does not exclude any flagged outliers. Columns 4 and 5
use ln(Energy Available) and Peak Shortage, respectively, instead of Shortage. Column 6 clusters
standard errors by state.
We make two explanatory comments. First, the first stage F-statistics for ln(Energy Available)
in column 4 are smaller than when using Shortage as the endogenous variable in the main estimates,
which is unsurprising: unlike Shortage, ln(Energy Available) grows monotonically within states over
the sample, and the state-specific linear time trends ψs t do not control very well for different states’
actual growth rates. Second, the first stage F-statistics increase in two specifications when clustering
by state in column 6, and this may be a small sample bias from having only 30 state-level clusters.

Alternative Instruments

This section presents estimates of Tables 6 and 7 with alternative instruments. Column 1 replicates the base estimates except using actual hydro generation instead of generation predicted from
reservoirs and run-of-river plants. Columns 2 and 3 add Nst , the predicted generation from plants
that came online in the previous year, as an additional supply shifter to increase power. Because
Indian states are still not large compared to generation from a single plant, new plants generate
lumpy reductions in shortages the year they come online. Power plants have a long and potentially
unpredictable time-to-build, so we assume that the year that a plant comes online is exogenous
conditional on state trends. The instrument in columns 2 and 3 is:
Zst =

Hst + Nst
.
Q̃st

(23)

To get Nst , we simply multiply the capacity added in the previous year by the national average
thermal plant capacity factor in year t. Column 2 uses Hst from reservoirs and run-of-river plants
(as in the base estimates), while column 3 instead uses actual hydro generation (as in column 1).
The results below show that adding Nst provides a moderate increase in precision but does not
otherwise change the results. We used this in an earlier working paper version, although it does
not appear in the body of the published version due to concerns about the exogeneity of Nst .

Heterogeneous Effects of Shortages

Table A17 presents estimates of heterogeneous effects of shortages for plants with generators and
for plants in industries with above-median electric intensity. Denote Mi as a 3-by-1 vector of these
two moderators and a constant. The estimating equation is identical to Equation 21 except with
Mi interacted with all right-hand-side variables other than µjt .
Table A17 presents the estimated interactions with the Shortage variable. As expected, column
2 shows that self-generators increase fuel use more when shortages worsen, while non-generators do
not. However, we do not have the power to detect heterogeneous effects on revenues or TFPR. As
a benchmark, in the World Bank Enterprise Survey, generators and non-generators report 7.3 and
8.4 percent losses from power cuts, respectively - a ratio of 8.4/7.3≈1.15. Our revenue estimates
are statistically indistinguishable from this benchmark ratio.
These empirical results are not interpretable as the average causal effects of generator ownership,
because endogenous generator adoption decisions could imply that the plants without generators
have unobservably smaller losses. For example, plants without generators might have unobservably
better electricity supply, reducing their losses from not adopting generators and also reducing the
effects of an increase in shortages.

Exogenous Generators: Cobb-Douglas

This section presents full details on how the simulations in Section VI determine optimal input
and output bundles conditional on exogenous generator ownership. Here we present the CobbDouglas model in Section III; subsequent sections present alternative models (Leontief and Constant
Elasticity of Substitution).
The procedure takes production function parameters {αE , αL , αM , αK } and exogenous state
variables capital Kit , productivity Ωit , and shortages δit . The optimal input choices of labor and
materials are solved using profit maximization conditions, and L∗ , M ∗G , M ∗S , E ∗G , E ∗S , and
R∗ are determined (where the superscripts S and G refer to shortage and non-shortage – grid –
respectively) . This procedure is repeated for each plant i observed in the ASI data.
1. Plants without generators
The optimal input bundles can be found analytically, using the first-order conditions. Nongenerators shut down during outages, so M S = E S = 0. The first-order condition for materials
during non-outage periods,

∂πitτ
∂Mitτ

= 0, yields

αM ΩK αK [M G ]αM −1 LαL [E G ]αE = pM .

72

(24)

Online Appendix

Analogously, the FOC for electricity,

∂πitτ
∂Eitτ

= 0, yields

αE ΩK αK [M G ]αM LαL [E G ]αE −1 = pE,G .
Finally, the FOC for labor,

∂πit
∂Lit

(25)

= 0 yields

αL (1 − δ)ΩK αK [M G ]αM LαL −1 [E G ]αE = pL .

(26)

Rearranging these three equations, we obtain:

Annual revenue is thus:
R = (1 − δ)ΩK αK [M ∗G ]αM [L∗ ]αL [E ∗G ]αE
Notice that if there are no shortages; δ = 0, the same equations can also be used to determine
optimal input bundles for all plants (assuming that pE,G < pE,S ).
2. Plants with generators
There are five first-order conditions,

∂πitτ
S
∂Eitτ

∂πit
∂Lit

These yield

αM ΩK αK [M G ]αM −1 LαL [E G ]αE = pM
αM ΩK αK [M S ]αM −1 LαL [E S ]αE = pM
αM ΩK αK [M S ]αM LαL [E S ]αE −1 = pE,S
αM ΩK αK [M G ]αM LαL [E G ]αE −1 = pE,G

αL (1 − δ)ΩK αK [M G ]αM LαL −1 [E G ]αE
+αL δpΩK αK [M S ]αM LαL −1 [E S ]αE = pL
The set of equations in system (28) are solved numerically in MATLAB using the fsolve routine. Rather than solving for L∗ , E ∗G , E ∗,S , M ∗G , and M ∗S in levels, we solve in logarithms,
since these values can differ by several orders of magnitude for different plants in the data.

The starting values for L∗ , E ∗G , E ∗S , M ∗G , and M ∗S are given by the analytic values from
equation (27), the no-shortage values.
Annual revenue is:
R =(1 − δ)ΩK αK [M ∗G ]αM [L∗ ]αL [E ∗G ]αE
+ δΩK αK [M ∗S ]αM [L∗ ]αL [E ∗S ]αE

Exogenous Generators: Leontief in Electricity

Our original working paper used production functions that were Leontief in electricity and a CobbDouglas aggregate of capital, labor, and materials. For comparison, we include this below.
Denoting physical productivity as A, the physical production function is:
1
Q = min{AK αK LαL M αM , E}
λ

(29)

The Leontief production function dictates that electricity is used in constant proportion

1
λ

with output. Electricity intensity λ varies across industries. Having A inside the Cobb-Douglas
aggregator ensures that electricity is used in fixed proportion to output instead of to the bundle of
other inputs.
Since we will observe total revenues rather than physical quantities produced, we need to relate
revenues to our production function in equation (29). We assume that plants sell into a perfectly
competitive output market with price p, and denote Ω ≡ pA.
Firms have the following daily profit function Πitτ :
αM 1
Πitτ =p min{Ait KitαK LαitL Mitτ
, Eitτ }
λ
L
M
E
− p Lit − p Mitτ − p Eitτ ,

(30)

where pL pM are the prices of labor and materials, respectively. Capital is excluded, as it is sunk
before the plant makes any production decisions.
Given the Leontief-in-electricity structure of production, cost minimization implies that for any
desired level of output Q, the firm produces at a “corner” of the isoquant where:
αM
Ait KitαK LαitL Mitτ
=

1
Eitτ ,
λ

(31)

Given this, one can rewrite the profit function, substituting in Ωit and the optimized value of
electricity:
Πitτ = (1 −

purchased from the grid. Notice that if (1 − γ) < 0, then the firm will choose not to produce.
There are three cases that can occur, depending on electricity intensity and the relative price
of electricity:
1. If p > λpE,S , the plant always produces, regardless of power outages.
2. If λpE,S > p > λpE,G , the plant does not produce during power outages, but does produce
otherwise.
3. If p < λpE,G , the plant never produces.
We ignore case (3): if plants never produce, they never appear in the data. Plants without generators effectively have pE,S = ∞, so case (1) cannot arise. Of the plants with generators, those with
higher λ will be in case (2). In other words, higher-electricity intensity plants will be more likely
to shut down during grid power outages.41
The first-order condition with respect to materials yields:

The plant operates when there is grid power, but not during an outage. The optimal input

Exogenous Generators: Constant Elasticity of Substitution

One issue with the production functions that we have considered is that there is no direct intertemporal substitution in production. Suppose instead that we consider a CES aggregator with constant
elasticity of substitution σ between days given by:
ˆ

σ

Rit =

(Ritτ ) dτ

1

σ

τ

Notice that this is a CES type aggregator, so there is symmetric substitution across all days of
the year. If σ = 1, we have the process considered in the paper. If σ < 1, outputs are interday
complements, and if σ > 1, then there is inter-day substitution.
Given that in the daily production function, only materials and electricity can be varied, we
can think of the daily production function as being written as:
Rit =

Ωit KitαK LαitL

ˆ

Notice that the daily returns to scale in the production function will be given by σ(αM + αE ),

where we have assumed that the same input choice will be optimal across days to go from
the first to the second line of this equation. Notice that shortages can cause anything between a
zero and infinite decrease in revenues by changing σ, holding inputs fixed. Thus, our predictions
are not robust to a range of σ. Moreover, the only difference between this setup and the setup

Comparing Predictions from Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES Models

Table A19 presents the simulated effects of the 2005 assessed Shortage levels Ss2005 relative to zero
shortage. Indeed, Table A19 replicates Panel A of Table 9. Column 1 shows the Cobb-Douglas
production function used in the body of the paper. Column 2 presents the Leontief model, while
columns 3 and 4 present results of the CES model with σ = 0.9 and σ = 0.5, respectively.42 The
predictions from the Cobb-Douglas and Leontief model are virtually identical, despite the different
functional forms and different approaches to production function estimation. In the CES model,
simulated losses are almost identical for plants with generators, but much larger for non-generators.
42

Using a higher value of σ such as σ = 1.5 yields the implication that a firm will have increasing returns at the
daily level, since the returns to scale in the daily production function are σ(αM + αE ), so σ(αM + αE ) > 1 means that
it is optimal to produce all output on a single day of the year. For the CES simulation, we use production function
coefficients αE , αL , αM , αK , and Ω, estimated from the Cobb-Douglas model. However, for non-generators, the CES
α coefficients can be estimated using the same equations as in the Cobb-Douglas model, and recall that there is little
difference in the estimates for generators and non-generators.

Endogenous Generators

For the model with endogenous generators, the equations given in Online Appendix F.B above are
used to obtain the optimal input bundle, conditional on the presence of a generator at the plant.
In this model, however, we also endogenously solve for generator adoption.
Plant i purchases a generator if and only if ΠGit −CitG > ΠN G , where ΠG and ΠN G are profitability
with and without generators, respectively, and CitG is the annualized generator cost.
Profits ΠG and ΠN G are both

where optimal inputs are according to the equations in Online Appendix F.B above.
F.F.1

Estimating Generator Costs

We parametrize the generator cost as ln CitG = σ0 + σ1 ln(cit ), where σ1 is the economy of scale
parameter, and cit is the generator capacity in kilowatts. We estimate σ0 and σ1 using GMM,
matching the mean generator adoption rate and the covariance between generator adoption and
log generator capacity. We use the identity matrix as a weighting matrix, since the two moments
that we match are of comparable scales. Column 1 of Table A20 presents GMM estimates of the
generator cost function.
For comparison, we collected generator purchase price data from the United States. To compare
to the estimated C G , we must first convert the purchase prices into yearly rental prices. First,
we convert generators rated in KVA into KW using a 0.8 conversion ratio. Second, we convert
US dollars into Rupees using a 50 to 1 exchange rate. Finally, we convert the purchase price of a
generator into an annual rental price assuming a 30 percent discount rate, a ten percent depreciation
rate, and a ten-year generator lifespan.43 This gives a 1.6:1 ratio between generator costs and rental
43

This 30 percent discount rate is high by U.S. standards, but as Banerjee and Duflo (2014) discuss, Indian firms

capacity.
The estimates of σ1 are close to 0.8 in both columns of Table A20. The estimates of σ0 are also
comparable (10.67 vs. 11.14), although the point estimate in column 1 is smaller. This gives us
some confidence that the estimated generator costs are approximately reasonable and that generator
costs can explain the fact that many manufacturing plants in the ASI do not have generators.

exceeds 90 percent at a seven percent δ, which may seem puzzling given that the generator cost estimates
are based on a 44 percent takeup rate in the ASI at a 7.2 percent mean shortage. The reason is that the
distribution of Ss2005 across plants is right skewed; the median of Ss2005 across plants is only 3.5 percent.
