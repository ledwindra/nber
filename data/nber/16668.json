    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes the findings from a new, and intrinsically interdisciplinary, literature on happiness and human well-being.  The paper focuses on international evidence.  We report the patterns in modern data; we discuss what has been persuasively established and what has not; we suggest paths for future research.  Looking ahead, our instinct is that this social-science research avenue will gradually merge with a related literature -- from the medical, epidemiological, and biological sciences -- on biomarkers and health.  Nevertheless, we expect that intellectual convergence to happen slowly.\n\n",
