How Ordinary Consumers Make Complex Economic Decisions: Financial Literacy and Retirement
Readiness

NBER Working Paper No. 15350
September 2009
JEL No. D91
ABSTRACT
This paper reports on several self-assessed and objective measures of financial literacy newly added
to the American Life Panel (ALP), and it links these performance measures to efforts consumers make
to plan for retirement. We evaluate the causal relationship between financial literacy and retirement
planning by exploiting information about respondents’ financial knowledge acquired in school - before
entering the labor market and certainly before starting to plan for retirement. Results show that those
with more advanced financial knowledge are those more likely to be retirement-ready.

How Ordinary Consumers Make Complex Economic Decisions:
Financial Literacy and Retirement Readiness
Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell

There can hardly be a better time to make the case for economic and financial
literacy... a better-informed citizenry would likely have resulted in more prudent
decision making and, consequently, less harm to the economy.1
Ordinary consumers must make extraordinarily complex financial decisions on a daily
basis, yet there is now growing evidence that households are rather poorly informed when they
make many consequential economic choices.2 Prior surveys reveal that financial illiteracy is
widespread among older individuals: only half of Americans age 50+ can correctly answer two
simple questions about compound interest and inflation; only one-third can answer these two
questions and another question on risk diversification.3 Financial literacy is also lacking among
the young; less than half of young adults (ages 23-27) understand interest compounding,
inflation, and risk diversification (Lusardi, Mitchell and Curto, 2008). Most importantly, there is
evidence that the least financially literate are the least likely to save for retirement (Lusardi and
Mitchell, 2006, 2007a, 2008).
This paper examines the questions of who is financially literate, whether people
accurately perceive their own economic decision-making skills, and where these skills come
from. To this end, we have designed and implemented a new set of questions on both financial
literacy and retirement planning for respondents to the American Life Panel (ALP), where we are
able to measure financial literacy in a more sophisticated manner than heretofore feasible. This

dataset also permits us to link these improved objective measures with respondents’ self-assessed
financial knowledge levels, and to compare what people know with what they think they know.
Most importantly, we seek to identify the causal links between financial literacy and retirement
planning by exploiting information about respondents’ financial knowledge acquired in school before entering the labor market and certainly before starting to plan for retirement.
Our results show that consumers have difficulty doing basic financial calculations, and
they also lack knowledge of fundamental financial market concepts such as risk diversification,
how the stock market works, and asset pricing. We also find that people who report a higher
level of knowledge of economics tend to score relatively well on the objective measures we
gather. And finally, we show that financial literacy contributes importantly to retirement
readiness, after correcting for potential endogeneity biases.
Our work makes three contributions to the existing literature. First, we enhance the
existing measures of financial literacy by providing not only an extensive set of questions to
measure financial literacy but also by assessing the quality of the data. Second, we are able to
explain why so many individuals do not plan for retirement; we find that lack of financial
knowledge is a cause of lack of retirement planning. Third, our data collected before the
financial crisis erupted provide clear warnings about lack of financial knowledge in the
population and the potential vulnerability of individuals who lack a firm grasp of basic financial
concepts.

Background
The theoretical framework used to model consumption/saving decisions posits that
rational and foresighted consumers derive utility from consumption over their lifetimes. In the
simplest format, the consumer has a lifetime expected utility, which is the expected value of the
sum of per-period utility U(cj) discounted to the present (using the discount factor β), multiplied
by the probability of survival pj, from the worker’s current age S to the oldest possible lifetime D:
⎡D
E ⎢∑ p j β
⎣ j =S

j −S

⎤
U (c j ) ⎥ .
⎦

Assets and consumption each period (aj and cj) are determined endogenously by maximizing this
function subject to an intertemporal budget constraint. Thus cj represents per period
consumption, ej is labor earnings, raj represents the household’s returns on assets aj, yj is income,
and SS and PP represent the household’s Social Security benefits and pensions, respectively,
which depend on the worker’s retirement age, R:

y j = e j + ra j , j ∈ [S ,..., R − 1]
and
y j = SS j ( R) + PPj ( R) + ra j , j ∈ [R,..., D ] .
Furthermore, consumption from income, assets, and benefits is set so that:
c j + a j +1 = y j + a j , j ∈ [S ,..., D ]. 4
In other words, the economic model posits that the consumer has to consider prospective survival
probabilities, discount rates, investment returns, earnings, pensions and Social Security benefits.

Lusardi and Mitchell (2007a, 2007b).
4
There is also the condition that assets in the last period of life are equal to zero and that the consumer does not die
leaving any debt.

4

Further, it posits that he/she uses that information to formulate and execute optimal
consumption/saving plans.
This formulation makes it clear that consumers making retirement saving decisions
require substantial financial literacy, in addition to the ability and tools needed to plan and carry
out retirement saving plans. Whether and how consumers behave in reality when confronted with
this challenge – that is, whether individuals have the knowledge and capability to plan and
implement these complex planning tasks – is a topic of substantial current interest.5 This subject
is particularly important in view of the fact that workers are increasingly being given
responsibility to save, manage their pension investments, and draw down their retirement assets
in the defined contribution pension environment. Accordingly, what is critically needed is new
information permitting analysts to investigate the links between financial literacy and economic
decision-making.
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal dataset
of Americans over the age of 50, has been designed to address some of these questions by
tracking health, assets, liabilities, and patterns of wellbeing in older households.6 Beginning in
1992, a 90-minute core questionnaire has been administered every two years to age-eligible
respondents and their spouses. In addition, a random sample of respondents has also been
subjected to very short experimental modules in each wave, aimed at helping researchers assess
additional topics of substantive interest. For the 2004 HRS wave, we designed and administered
a special module on financial literacy and retirement planning, seeking to assess respondents’

See, for example, the discussion in Campbell (2006) and Lusardi (2008). Note also that many countries have
started to collect data to measure citizens’ financial capability. For instance, the UK started a new survey on
financial capability a few years ago, and similar surveys have been done or are under way in Ireland, the
Netherlands, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.

level of financial literacy along with their efforts to budget, calculate, and develop retirement
saving plans, in relatively few questions (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006).
The three questions on financial literacy we designed, which have by now become
standard in assessing economic literacy and are included in many other surveys in the United
States and abroad, are as follows:7
•
•
•

Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2 percent per
year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left
the money to grow: more than $102, exactly $102, or less than $102?
Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 percent per year and
inflation was 2 percent per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy more than,
exactly the same as, or less than today with the money in this account?
Do you think that the following statement is true or false? “Buying a single company
stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.”

The first two items indicate whether respondents are aware of compound interest and inflation,
fundamental concepts required for making saving decisions. The third evaluates respondents’
knowledge of risk diversification, also crucial for making informed decisions.
We found strikingly low performance on these basic financial literacy questions. For
instance, one-fourth responded incorrectly to the first question. The accuracy rate for the second
question was higher (75 percent correct), but only slightly over half (56 percent) got both
answers correct, indicating a very poor level of basic knowledge in this older population.
Moreover, only half (52 percent) of the respondents correctly answered the risk diversification
question, and one-third (34 percent) said they did not know (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006). These
are important findings since correct responses to these simple questions are strongly associated
with successful retirement planning: those who cannot do a simple interest calculation, do not

7

For example, these questions have been added to the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a survey of U.S.
pension providers, the 2005 Dutch Household Survey, the 2006 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth, the
2008 World Bank Russia Financial Literacy and Financial Education Survey, the 2009 German SAVE, the 2009

know about inflation and risk diversification are also much less likely to calculate how much
they need to save for retirement (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006, 2008).
Several research questions remain outstanding, which we address below. We believe it
imperative to expand the range of measures of financial literacy, so as to better evaluate the types
of problems that people find most difficult. It is also important to determine whether people are
aware of their areas of weakness. And finally, much prior research, including all our own work
with the HRS, focused only on those in the 50+ age group; in what follows we expand our
purview to the entire population.

Data and Methodology

In this paper, we use data from the Rand American Life Panel (ALP). This is an Internetbased survey of respondents age 18+ recruited by the University of Michigan’s Survey Research
Center.8 Using the internet to collect data is desirable in that it permits respondents to read
questions on the screen and reflect upon them before responding. Moreover, this approach to data
collection permits the researcher to alter how questions are framed so as to assess whether and
how people understand the questions posed.
The ALP survey collects numerous socioeconomic variables (age, sex, marital status,
race/ethnicity, and income). In addition, we have devised a set of financial literacy and planning
questions aimed at households in their prime earning years, as we seek to assess the information
sets available to them when they make some of these critical financial decisions. Specifically, we

This sample was recruited from former participants in the Survey of Consumer Attitudes used to generate
Michigan’s Index of Consumer Expectations. ALP participants use their own computers or a Web TV to log on to
the Internet monthly where they are asked to complete an online survey lasting no more than half an hour at a time.
The initial sample had relatively high education and income; this paper uses sample weights to make the respondents
representative of the U.S. population. For more information see www.rand.org/labor/roybalfd/american_life.html.

seek to differentiate levels of financial knowledge and also collect information on both objective
and subjective measures of financial literacy. Most importantly, we have variables that can help
assess the effects of financial literacy on behavior.
We use two sets of questions to test for economic knowledge. The first set follows the
HRS approach, which captures people’s capacity to handle basic financial literacy concepts,
including compound interest, inflation, and the time value of money. The second set is intended
to capture sophisticated financial literacy; here we seek to measure more advanced financial
knowledge such as the risk/return difference between stocks and bonds, how the stock market
and risk diversification work, and the relationship between bond prices and interest rates.
The precise wording of the five basic financial literacy questions we ask in the ALP is as
follows: 9
Basic Financial Literacy Questions
1. Numeracy
Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2 percent per year. After
5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to
grow? (i) More than $102; (ii) Exactly $102; (iii) Less than $102; (iv) Do not know (DK); (v)
Refuse.
2. Compound Interest
Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate is 20 percent per year and
you never withdraw money or interest payments. After 5 years, how much would you have
on this account in total? (i) More than $200; (ii) Exactly $200; (iii) Less than $200; (iv) DK;
(v) Refuse.
3. Inflation
Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 percent per year and inflation
was 2 percent per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with the money in
this account? (i) More than today; (ii) Exactly the same; (iii) Less than today; (iv) DK; (v)
Refuse.
4. Time Value of Money
Assume a friend inherits $10,000 today and his sibling inherits $10,000 3 years from now.
Who is richer because of the inheritance? (i) My friend; (ii) His sibling; (iii) They are equally
rich; (iv) DK; (v) Refuse.
5. Inflation/Money Illusion

As previously noted, two questions were piloted in the 2004 HRS; see Lusardi and Mitchell (2006). The additional
questions were piloted in the 2005 Dutch DNB Household Survey; see van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie (2007).

8

Suppose that in the year 2010, your income has doubled and prices of all goods have doubled
too. In 2010, how much will you be able to buy with your income? (i) More than today; (ii)
The same; (iii) Less than today; (iv) DK; (v) Refuse.
In addition, competent planning for retirement and investing of retirement assets requires
several additional financial concepts, including an understanding of the risk/return relationship,
risk diversification, and how stocks and bonds work. To quantify how sophisticated people are in
this realm, we devised eight additional questions. The exact wording of these sophisticated
questions is as follows:10
Sophisticated Financial Literacy Questions
1. Stock Market Functioning
Which of the following statements describes the main function of the stock market? (i) The
stock market helps to predict stock earnings; (ii) The stock market results in an increase in
the price of stocks; (iii) The stock market brings people who want to buy stocks together with
those who want to sell stocks; (iv) None of the above; (v) DK; (vi) Refuse.
2. Knowledge of Mutual Funds
Which of the following statements is correct? (i) Once one invests in a mutual fund, one
cannot withdraw the money in the first year; (ii) Mutual funds can invest in several assets, for
example invest in both stocks and bonds; (iii) Mutual funds pay a guaranteed rate of return
which depends on their past performance; (iv) None of the above; (v) DK; (vi) Refuse.
3. Interest Rate/Bond Prices Link
If the interest rate falls, what should happen to bond prices? (i) Rise; (ii) Fall; (iii) Stay the
same; (iv) None of the above; (v) DK; (vi) Refuse.
4. Safer: Company Stock or Mutual Fund
True or false? Buying a company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual
fund. (i) True; (ii) False; (iii) DK; (iv) Refuse.
5. Riskier: Stocks or Bonds
True or false? Stocks are normally riskier than bonds. (i) True; (ii) False; (iii) DK; (iv)
Refuse.
6. Long Period Returns
Considering a long time period (for example 10 or 20 years), which asset normally gives the
highest return? (i) Savings accounts; (ii) Bonds; (iii) Stocks; (iv) DK; (vi) Refuse.
7. Highest Fluctuation/Volatility
Normally, which asset displays the highest fluctuations over time? (i) Savings accounts; (ii)
Bonds; (iii) Stocks; (iv) DK; (v) Refuse.
8. Risk Diversification
When an investor spreads his money among different assets, does the risk of losing money:
(i) Increase; (ii) Decrease; (iii) Stay the same; (iv) DK; (v) Refuse.
10

One question was introduced in the 2004 HRS and the remaining questions were in the 2005 Dutch DNB
Household Survey. See Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) and van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie (2007).

9

To further assess whether respondents actually understand the questions posed (versus
simply guessing the answers), we take advantage of the Internet format to randomly reverse the
question wording order for three questions: Q5, the simpler question about risk differences
between bonds and stocks; Q4, a more difficult question about risk diversification; and Q3, the
most difficult question about the link between bond prices and interest rates. Specifically, these
word reversals are as reported below:
Randomization of Word Order for Three Sophisticated Financial Literacy Questions
Q5. True or false?
(a) Stocks are normally riskier than bonds.
(b) Bonds are normally riskier than stocks.
Q4. True or false?
(a) Buying a company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.
(b) Buying a stock mutual fund usually provides a safer return than a company stock.
Q3. Rise/fall/stay the same/none of the above?
(a) If the interest rate falls, what should happen to bond prices?
(b) If the interest rate rises, what should happen to bond prices?

In addition to these factual questions, we also ask the following summary selfassessment: On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means very low and 7 means very high, how would
you assess your understanding of economics? This is intended to assess people’s confidence
about the factual questions above, as well as what they believe they know about other financial
concepts and financial instruments (e.g. mortgages, credit cards, etc.).
A crucial question is what might explain people’s different levels of financial literacy. To
glean a better understanding of how people might acquire financial literacy capital, we explore
two possible sources of exposure to financial education early in the lifetime, namely exposure in
school and in the workplace. Accordingly, we ask respondents about whether they were exposed
to financial training during youth, well before they enter the job market and begin planning for
retirement. This is elicited with the following query: How much of your school’s education (high

10

school, college or higher degrees) was devoted to economics? A lot, some, little, or hardly at all?
Next, we ask respondents about their exposure to financial education in the workplace: Did any
of the firms you worked for offer financial education programs, for example retirement
seminars? i)Yes, ii) No, iii) Not applicable. As we show below, this enhanced set of questions
provides new information not available in prior financial literacy surveys.

Do People Plan for Retirement?

As mentioned earlier, one of the difficulties of assessing the effects of financial literacy
on behavior is that financial literacy may itself be the result of choice. Moreover, there are
several channels through which financial literacy might affect interesting outcomes such as
retirement saving. Rather than examining the effects of financial literacy on wealth or portfolio
choice directly, in what follows, we focus on one specific but very important determinant of
savings, namely retirement planning. As the model sketched above posits, consumers should be
forward-looking and planning ahead for the future. Yet this simple model does not incorporate
any difficulty or planning costs that people may face, particularly in the face of widespread
financial illiteracy. The prediction of simple models that incorporate such costs is that people
who are more financially literate are more efficient at devising retirement plans; in turn, lower
planning costs enhance the likelihood of people planning for retirement. Accordingly, we
examine whether financial literacy results in enhanced retirement planning.
To evaluate this outcome, we use the retirement planning measure we devised in the
HRS, which is a strong predictor of wealth (Lusardi, 1999, 2003; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a;
Lusardi and Beeler, 2007). The question wording is as follows: How much have you thought

11

about retirement? A lot, some, little, or hardly at all?11 A few papers have already assessed the
relationships between retirement planning and financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006,
2007a, 2008), but they have not yet proved the direction of causality between financial literacy
and retirement planning. In what follows, we use a more exogenous source of variation with
regard to financial literacy than has been attempted in previous work, to get at this causality.

Empirical Results

Our evidence on basic and sophisticated financial literacy measures appears in Tables 1
and 2. The empirical analysis includes 989 observations taken from the ALP; summary statistics
appear in Appendix Table 1. The average respondent age is 45; 60 percent of respondents are
married and 48 percent are male; 29 percent of the sample has a high school or lower degree; and
16 percent are fully retired.12
It will be recalled that the basic financial literacy questions are intended to measure
simple concepts crucial for everyday financial transactions and decision-making. Table 1 reports
response patterns by question (Panels A and B) and by respondent socioeconomic characteristics
(Panel C). The results show that ALP respondents can do simple calculations regarding interest
rates and they also understand the effects of inflation. Yet almost a quarter of respondents cannot
give the right answer to the compound interest question and the query regarding the time value of
money.13 Similarly, a sizable fraction of respondents suffers from money illusion. Moreover,
even though respondents can respond to individual questions accurately, fewer than half (44

11

In the 2004 HRS module, we used different wording to elicit whether people plan for retirement. Specifically, we
asked respondents whether they ever tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement. These two
planning measures display a strong positive correlation; despite its simplicity, the measure used in this paper does a
better job of differentiating between different types of planners.
12

multiple responses.

percent) of the respondents can correctly answer all five questions (Panel B). In other words, in
the ALP survey, basic financial concepts are not widely understood.
Panel C offers insight into which financial literacy patterns vary by age, educational
attainment, and sex. Respondents age 50+ are consistently better informed, although the age
differences are often not large. Differences in financial literacy by education are more striking:
those with less than college are much more likely to respond incorrectly, especially to questions
on compound interest, the time value of money, and inflation. It is also clear that women exhibit
much lower levels of financial literacy than men, where sex differences are large for all but the
money illusion question. These findings are similar to those in the older sample of the HRS
(Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006, 2008), and international surveys as well (see OECD Report on
Financial Literacy (2005) for an overview).
Responses to the new, more sophisticated financial literacy questions are summarized in
Table 2. Panel A shows that most respondents (over three-quarters) get most of the answers
right, so they do have some knowledge of how the stock market and risk diversification work.
They are also more likely to be more knowledgeable about fluctuations in assets than about
patterns of asset returns. But the question linking bond prices and interest rates proves very
difficult: only one-third knows about this relationship. There is also a wide range of incorrect and
don’t know (DK) responses, with the DK’s ranging from 6 to 25 percent depending on the
question. Also of interest is the fact shown in Panel B that only 16 percent of respondents can
answer all eight of these sophisticated questions accurately, confirming that sophisticated
financial literacy is not widespread.

13

Difficulties with interest compounding are similarly documented in other papers (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a;
van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007; Lusardi and Tufano, 2009).

13

More detail on who can accurately answer the questions appears by socioeconomic group
in Panel C. As with the basic financial literacy questions, younger respondents are less well
informed than their older counterparts: for instance, 60 percent of the younger people versus 69
percent of the older ones know about mutual funds. The younger group is also 20 percentage
points less likely to correctly judge that owning company stock is riskier than investing in an
equity mutual fund. This corroborates our findings from another study, where we examined data
from round 11 of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), which included
the same three financial literacy questions used in the HRS. There we also found that financially
illiteracy was widespread among young people (Lusardi, Mitchell and Curto, 2008). Once again,
the better educated respondents are more knowledgeable than their less educated counterparts,
with those having at least some college having much more accurate views of what the stock
market does and the long run expected return advantage for stocks. Sex differences are sharp, in
that women know substantially less than men with regard to mutual funds, risk diversification,
long term returns, and the relationship between bond prices and interest rates.14
To establish whether respondents actually know the answers to our questions, we invert
the order of three questions and results appear in Table 3. Responses to Q5 regarding the risk of
bonds versus stocks are unaffected by which asset appears first in the question. This is an
important result that shows that respondents generally understand the meaning of this question
and hence are unlikely to be guessing in their responses. By contrast, a different pattern emerges
for Q4, the more difficult query about company stock versus stock mutual funds. We previously
piloted this wording in the 2004 HRS where it was asked over the telephone; in that instance,
almost half of the older HRS respondents could not answer correctly or stated they did not know

(2009) for evidence of lower “debt literacy” among women.

14

the answer. In the ALP, it is interesting that 74 percent of the Internet respondents get the answer
right when the question is structured so that the correct answer is True, but 68 percent get it right
when the correct answer is False. Thus there is confusion among respondents about this
question. Answers to Q3, which is a complex question about bond pricing, are again affected by
the wording: 46 percent get the answer wrong when the question asks what happens when
interest rates fall, while 41 percent get it wrong when the interest rate is stipulated to rise. What
this shows is that financial knowledge is likely measured with error; accordingly, empirical
analysis of such patterns must take this into account. Below we deal with this issue in more
detail.
To differentiate respondents’ levels of financial knowledge, we next undertake factor
analysis to construct a financial literacy index with the rich information obtained about basic and
sophisticated financial literacy. Our initial analysis of the complete set of 13 questions pointed to
two main factors with different loading on the basic versus the sophisticated financial literacy
questions. Therefore we performed a separate factor analysis on the two types of queries
separately, which permits us to construct two financial literacy indices: one related to basic
knowledge, and a second measuring more advanced concepts.15*
To show that these indices measure economic knowledge, Table 4 reports the relationship
between these more objective financial literacy measures and the subjective indicator of financial
knowledge in which people self-report their own understanding of economics on a scale from 1
to 7 (see Panels A and B). We note that this question appeared at the beginning of the financial
literacy module, before any of the basic and advanced financial literacy questions were posed, so
respondents’ views were not contaminated by the financial literacy questions. Note that most

15

respondents chose high scores: that is 269 (out of 989) respondents grade themselves as a 4 out
of 7; 343 assign themselves a level of 5; and 165 report their level is 6 (and 44 report their
knowledge of economics is very high or 7 out of 7). Most importantly, there is a very strong
correlation between objective and subjective financial literacy. That is, the majority of
respondents who report they know a lot about economics (self-reporting a score of 6 or 7) also
fall in the top two quartiles of the basic financial literacy index. The relationship becomes even
stronger when we consider the advanced financial literacy index, where more than 50 percent of
respondents who report low levels of economic knowledge (scoring 1, 2 or 3) fall in the lowest
quartile of the financial literacy index, whereas the majority of those who report high knowledge
fall in the top two quartiles of the financial literacy index. In sum, while there is some noise and
measurement error affecting these indices, self-reports provide useful information about
economic knowledge.
Next we seek to explore how knowledge is formed or developed by seeing how basic and
sophisticated financial literacy compares between those who have and have not been exposed to
financial literacy in high school and at work. As Panels C and D of Table 4 indicate, those
exposed to financial education earlier in life have high levels of financial literacy during
adulthood. Exposure to economics in school makes respondents more likely to locate in the top
quartiles of sophisticated financial literacy. Furthermore, those exposed to financial education in
the workplace are much less likely to fall in lower quartiles of the financial literacy index (Panels
A and B of Table 5).

16

Financial Literacy and Retirement Planning

Ultimately we seek to answer not only whether respondents are financially literate, but
also whether financial literacy matters in financial decision-making. To this end, we next assess
whether financial literacy influences retirement planning, which has previously been found to be
a powerful determinant of wealth (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007a). Retirement planning is readily
assessed by asking how much respondents have thought about retirement; results by
socioeconomic characteristics appear in Table 6. The majority of ALP respondents (68 percent)
reports having thought some or a lot about retirement. Moreover, older, better educated, and
male respondents are more likely to be planners. These are also the characteristics of people who
have a higher level of financial knowledge.
Next we turn to a multivariate analysis where we link retirement planning to financial
literacy, holding constant other socioeconomic factors. Our objective is to assess whether
financial literacy has an effect on planning, above and beyond the traditional determinants of
planning considered in life-cycle models of saving, such as age and income (and several other
demographics that can account for differences in preferences, such as sex, education, and marital
status). Two models appear in Table 7. The first is an ordinary linear multivariate regression
(OLS; column 1), where the dependent variable takes the value of 1 if the respondent has thought
“hardly at all about retirement”, and it rises to a value of 4 for someone who has thought “a lot”
about retirement. Here we see that financial knowledge is indeed influential in retirement
planning, even after controlling for a range of socioeconomic factors. In other words, the index
of financial literacy still has its own independent effect, above and beyond other determinants of
planning. Even more telling is that sophisticated financial knowledge is the most important
factor. We also note that both financial literacy and formal education are important: thus having

17

an advanced degree boosts the probability of retirement planning even after controlling for
financial literacy.16 This confirms HRS results in models which use a similar planning measure
but include only the basic financial literacy questions (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2006).17
The second column in Table 7 is offered to explore the question of whether financial
literacy is itself endogenous. That is, if those who attempted to plan for retirement became more
financially knowledgeable, then planning could be said to influence financial literacy rather than
the reverse. To evaluate this possibility, we have used a more exogenous source of variation in
financial literacy as an instrument. Specifically, we note that, over the last several decades,
several U.S. states have mandated high school financial education (mostly due to political
rationales rather than to stimulate retirement planning; see Bernheim, Garrett, and Maki, 2001).18
Since the ALP reports the state in which respondents were born, we use it as a proxy for state
residence at age 17 so we can infer whether the state in which the respondent lived at that time
had mandated financial education.
Our model also adds additional interactions to take into account nonlinear exposure to
this financial literacy training. For instance, exposure to such programs could contribute to the
accumulation of knowledge later in life, so we interact the mandate dummy with age to discern
whether the effect grows over the life cycle. To evaluate sex differences, we interact the mandate

16

Some have argued that financial literacy measures are simply a proxy for cognitive ability. We address this
problem by designing questions that test for “knowledge” rather than simply skills and IQ. One question that
measures knowledge of finance is the one related to bond pricing, and in general, many of the sophisticated financial
literacy questions cannot be answered correctly without some knowledge of economics and finance. In our estimate,
it is the sophisticated financial literacy index that is statistically significant, and it seems unlikely that this indicator
is merely proxying for cognition. Moreover, in studies where we can directly control for IQ/cognitive ability, we
find that financial literacy effects remain statistically significant (Lusardi, Mitchell and Curto, 2008; van Rooij,
Lusardi and Alessie, 2007).
17
To the extent that our literacy questions are noisy measures, the OLS estimates may suffer from attenuation bias
and therefore underestimate the full effects of financial literacy.
18
Here, the instrumental variables strategy, which relies on state high school mandates to teach financial literacy
implemented in different states and across different periods of time, also avoids the problem of proxying for
cognitive ability. As a result we are confident that our estimates actually measure the effects of financial literacy
rather than cognition or intelligence.

dummy with sex to see whether requiring high school financial education has a differential
impact for men versus women. Finally, we interact the dummy with educational expenses per
pupil when the respondent was age 17 to account for the fact that some schools, while mandating
financial education, may not have increased their budget to accommodate this new program.
These additional variables are in keeping with Card and Krueger (1992) and Burtless (1996),
who show that individuals who lived in states where higher amounts of resources were devoted
to education do have better outcomes (for example, higher rates of return to education) later in
life.
Estimates from the first stage regression in Table 8 highlight the importance of not only
mandating financial education but also allocating resources to education. Financial knowledge is
higher in those states that mandated education and spent more on education.
To focus attention on the sophisticated financial literacy measures developed for this
paper, the instrumental variables (IV) estimation is performed on the advanced financial literacy
index only. Results appear in Table 7, where we see that the instruments are statistically
significant both individually and jointly. The estimates show that the impact of the financial
literacy index in the planning equation is positive, statistically significant, and larger than the
OLS estimate. Financial literacy not only matters for planning but its effect is sizable. Increasing
the financial literacy index from values in the first quartile to values in the third quartile would
move the respondent up one level in the retirement planning scale (i.e., if the respondent was
planning for retirement “hardly at all”, it would now plan “a little” for retirement). Given the
relationship between retirement planning and wealth, this also means that higher financial
literacy would lead to higher wealth accumulation. Consequently, we conclude that financial
literacy does influence retirement planning, and that exogenous variation in financial literacy is

19

needed to disentangle the causal relationships of interest between consumer financial decisionmaking and the building of financial human capital.

Alternative Empirical Specifications and Robustness Checks

We have also explored alternative specifications to help assess the robustness of our
findings. For instance, as we noted earlier, there appears to be some measurement error in
answers provided to the sophisticated financial literacy questions, since responses to the
questions where wording was randomized suggest some evidence of guessing. Accordingly,
Panel A of Table 9 excludes from the financial literacy index the three questions that we
randomized, to help examine the sensitivity of our estimates to the type of questions included in
the financial literacy index. In particular, these results exclude the most difficult question about
bond pricing, which means that the new financial literacy index is restricted to simpler
knowledge levels. We have used the same set of controls as in Table 7 (for brevity, estimates of
the controls are not reported). The coefficient of this alternative index of financial literacy is
again positive and statistically significant.
Two additional robustness checks split the sample by age and retirement status, in order
to focus attention on respondents who are likely to be most actively planning ahead for
retirement. Accordingly, Panel B excludes those older than 62 and Panel C excludes respondents
who report themselves as fully retired. Restricting the sample to the younger age group may
permit the instruments to have stronger predictive power, since economic training acquired in
high school may become obsolete over time. The importance of financial literacy remains strong
in these alternative specifications, and the magnitudes of the IV coefficient estimate remain

20

positive and statistically significant as before. In sum, we conclude that more financially
knowledgeable younger and non-retired respondents are also more likely to plan for retirement.

Conclusion and Discussion

Policymakers are beginning to acknowledge the central importance of financial literacy
for a well-functioning economy: for instance, Roger Ferguson (2002), as Federal Reserve Board
Vice Chairman, noted that “when millions of educated consumers make good personal financial
choices, our economy is strengthened in fundamental ways.” Nowhere is this more true than in
the retirement preparedness arena. Yet planning for retirement is a complex undertaking,
requiring the consumer to gather and process data on compound interest, risk diversification, and
inflation, and make assumptions about future asset market performance. This paper contributes
to the literature on what consumers know and how their financial literacy capital drives their
retirement planning and saving patterns.
The present research using the ALP extends prior analysis using the HRS by Lusardi and
Mitchell (2006, 2007a) inasmuch as the earlier work used much simpler financial literacy
questions. By contrast, here we explore several additional dimensions of the financial literacy
picture. Furthermore, we create a financial literacy index and correct for possible endogeneity
using some sensible instruments. By every measure, and in every sample we have examined, we
conclude that financial literacy is a key determinant of retirement planning. We also find that
respondent financial literacy is higher when consumers have been exposed to economics in
school and in employer-sponsored programs.19

19

Our work extends the findings derived using more specialized samples by Bernheim, Garrett and Maki (2001) and
Bernheim and Garrett (2003).

21

This research should be of interest to educators and employers seeking to enhance efforts
to plan and save for retirement, as well as researchers interested in exploring financial literacy
further. In the future, it will be critical to ask specific questions about financial knowledge as
outlined here, since education, income, and age are correlated with but do not adequately capture
all the dimensions of respondents’ financial literacy human capital. Additionally, the fact that we
find more financially literate adults to be more likely to plan for retirement complements work
by other analysts seeking to link financial sophistication and decision-making. For instance,
some evidence points to the fact that financially unsophisticated households tend to avoid the
stock market (van Rooij, Lusardi and Alessie, 2007; Kimball and Shumway, 2006; Christelis,
Jappelli and Padula, 2006), and are less likely to choose mutual funds with lower fees (Hastings
and Tejeda-Ashton, 2008). The financially unsophisticated are also less likely to refinance their
mortgages in a propitious environment (Campbell, 2006), and they select less advantageous
mortgages in the first place (Moore, 2003). People who cannot correctly calculate interest rates
given a stream of payments tend to borrow more and accumulate less wealth (Stango and
Zinman, 2008). Now our results show that the financially illiterate do not plan for retirement
either.
We are cognizant of the fact that promoting financial literacy is a difficult and likely
costly task, and more research is required to determine when and how to most efficiently invest
in consumer financial literacy. It is also clear that it is necessary to enhance financial knowledge
if consumers are to do a better job navigating the complexities of the modern financial
environment. Indeed, very young adults receive multiple credit cards, they may take out loans,
and they can readily purchase assets ranging from mutual funds to stocks and tax-favored plans
such as IRAs and 401(k)s. However, our work shows that young adults are not well equipped to

22

make financial decisions (Lusardi, Mitchell and Curto, 2008). Saving for retirement is becoming
more challenging but also more critical for younger consumers, requiring ever-greater levels of
financial sophistication. It is thus urgent to develop, evaluate, and target effective programs to
those who can put this necessary financial knowledge to work.

Appendix Table 2. Constructing the Financial Literacy Index: Factor Loadings

The two summary financial literacy indices are based on responses to the five basic and eight sophisticated
financial literacy questions discussed in the text. For each question we construct a dummy variable indicating
which respondents answered the question correctly. We then perform factor analysis on those binary variables
using the principal component factor method; factor loadings are presented below. We retain one factor that
summarizes respondent financial literacy using factor scores derived with the Bartlett (1937) method.
Basic Financial Literacy Questions
Numeracy
Compound interest
Inflation
Time value of money
Money illusion

Factor loadings

Factor loadings

Knowledge of mutual funds
Bond prices and interest rates
Safer: company stock or stock mutual fund?
Riskier: stocks or bonds?
Higher LR return: stocks or bonds
