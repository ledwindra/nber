    "abstract": "\n\nIt is well known that exposure to lead has numerous adverse effects on behavior and development. Using data on two cohorts of children from the NLSY, this paper investigates the effect of early childhood lead exposure on behavior problems from childhood through early adulthood. I find large negative consequences of early childhood lead exposure, in the form of an unfolding series of adverse behavioral outcomes: behavior problems as a child, pregnancy and aggression as a teen, and criminal behavior as a young adult. At the levels of lead that were the norm in United States until the late 1980s, estimated elasticities of these behaviors with respect to lead range between 0.1 and 1.0.\n\n",

Many individuals at government agencies and petroleum industry companies generously provided information on lead in gasoline, and Jenny Ying shared data on teen pregnancy policies. Steve Trask provided excellent research assistance. Any remaining errors are my own. This research was supported by Amherst College and the National Bureau of Economic Research.
