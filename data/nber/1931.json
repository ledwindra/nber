    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents an empirical analysis of firm-specific\nemployment and wage outcomes for mechanics in the domestic airline\nindustry. A dynamic contracting model is presented that incorporates\nboth costly employment adjustment and potential gaps between contract\nwage rates and the opportunity value of workers' time. The model gives\na useful description of the employment-output linkage in the data, but\nis less successful in capturing the dynamic relation between employment,\ncontract wage rates, and wage rates outside the airline industry.\n\n",
