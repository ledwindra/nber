STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN A DEBT BARGAINING FRAMEWORX

ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the strategic role of investment from a debtor
country's perspective.

The framework is one in which, if the debtor

country is unable to meet debt obligations, a bargaining regime determines
the amount of debt repayment.

In the context of a two-country real trade

model, debt repayment is equal to the trade surplus of the debtor.

The

outcome of the bargaining game will therefore be dependent (among other
things) on the level of production in the debtor country.

In this

framework, the paper shows that productive investment may increase or
decrease the bargaining power of the debtor country.

This ambiguity

appears to be fairly robust.

Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the strategic role of

investment in a debt situation that includes the possiblity of default
and establishnent of a bargaining regime in which debtor and creditor
negotiate the anount of repayment.

The recent literature has

developed the notion of the debt overhang, which argues that old debt
works as a tax on new investment.

This effect follows from the

assumption that creditors obtain a share in the proceeds from new
investment, and this acts as an effective tax on new investment.

This

paper describes an environment in which, due to strategic

considerations, the debt overhang generates ambiguous incentives over
investment.

In particular, we identify a case in which investnient

helps the debtor country to obtain a better outcome in the bargaining
process.

In this case, the debt overhang acts as a subsidy to

investment.

The possibility of default by the debtor country introduces two
separate effects.

The first is the standard credit rationing effect.

This means that the debtor country faces an upward—sloping credit
supply and an overall ceiling on foreign debt, with the consequent
increase in the domestic real interest rate and decrease in productive
investment.

Note that this effect is independent from and additional

to the "debt tax" argument suggested by the debt overhang literature.
The second is the strategic effect of partial defaults: the effect of
an increase in investment on the outcome of the bargaining game for
the debtor.

The sign and magnitude of this effect depends on the

characteristics of the bargaining game.

This paper shows that productive investment may either improve or
worsen the bargaining outcome for the debtor, which implies that the
debt overhang does not necessarily act as a tax on investment in this
sense.

To analyze the role of strategic investment, we start by

describing the supply of credit facing the debtor in this context.

The credit supply schedule incorporates the possibility of a
bargaining regime, either as a random future event or as the current
regime.

Because the outcome of the bargaining process is detennined

(aniong other factors) by the capital stock of the debtor economy the

supply schedule shifts with changes in investment in the debtor
economy. j/

When choosing its optimal capital accumulation, the debtor
country considers the effects on the foreign debt situation.

The

debtor must weigh two effects: a direct effect on the amount of
repayment (the outcome of the bargaining game), and an indirect effect
on the cost of borrowing (the response of the credit supply function).
The paper shows that the direct repayment effect always dominates.
The reason is that a reduction in the cost of credit benefits the

country only in the good states of nature, when the country chooses
not to default, while a better bargaining outcome benefits the country
in the bad states of nature, when it prefers to default on foreign

debt payments.

Because the niarginal utility of consumption and the

marginal value of traded inputs are both higher in the bad states of
nature, gains obtained in the bargaining regime are more valuable than
gains obtained in the nondefault regime.
The change in the bargaining outcome as a response to investment
in the debtor country is not uniquely determined and depends on the
particular structure of international trade.

Our basic framework is

one in which trade takes place on primary productive inputs, while the
final good (used for both consumption and investment) is non—tradable.
International trade benefits are thus obtained from input
diversification.

In this context, the effect of investment depends on

the substitutability between capital and traded inputs in the
production function of the debtor country.

If the elasticity of

substitution of capital with traded inputs exceeds (falls short of)
unity, an increase in investment increases (reduces) the repayntent to
the creditor.

We confirm the robustness of this general result by

analyzing an alternative international trade framework, which is a
simplified two-country two—good trade model.

In this case, the effect

of investment on debt repayments depends on the specification of the
utility functions and it may also be either positive or negative.

II.

The Supply of Credit

We will initially assume that in the first period a free—trade
regime exists because debt is not large enough for the debtors to
3

default in its service and enter the bargaining situation.

However,

there is uncertainty concerning the second period, and there is some
probability of default.

If the debtor country can expect a better

outcome by entering the bargaining game than by fully servicing its
debt, it will default on its debt.

For simplicity, we will assume

that the only source of uncertainty is a random shock to the supply of
the debtor country's primary input.

There are two possible states of

nature: a high-output state (positive supply shock) and a low-output
state (negative supply shock).

These states are indexed by (H,L).

Therefore, the supply of the debtor's primary product can take two
and

values:

Let R denote the total payoff on foreign debt obtained by the
creditor country in the second period.

In this two—country world, R

is equal to the trade deficit run by the creditor country when trade
flows are valuated at the free—trade prices.

In the bargaining

regime, two payoffs are possible according to the prevailing state of
nature, which verify:

(1)

RH

>

because some of the extra output available in the high—output state
will be received as debt repayment by the creditor.

Though plausible,

the above statement is not self—evident; however, it can be easily
proved for the bargaining model described in the next section, which
is done in the Appendix.

4

We will assume that the creditor country behaves according to a
naxinnnn expected value rule.

This inplies that the creditor's supply

curve will satisfy the following condition:

(1+r)B

(2)

E(R)

where r is the risk—free interest rate.

Note that R depends on the

regine prevailing in the second period, that is, on whether there will
be full repayment of debt or a bargaining outcone.

Moreover, if the

bargaining regine prevails, R will be dependent on the state of
nature.

Therefore, R can take three values: (1+r)B, RH, and RL,

according to the regine at the tine of repayment and to the state of
nature, where r represents the contractual interest rate charged on
loans.

For given values of the state variables (the capital stocks in
the debtor and creditor countries), the debt level niay fall in three

different regions giving rise to three different segments in the
credit supply function:

a horizontal segment, an upward—sloping

segnent, and a vertical segment.

For very low values of debt, the

debtor will prefer full payment to entering a bargaining situation.
Let B denote the naximum debt level for which the debtor will choose
not to bargain (in either state of nature) and will repay debts in
full.

(3)

That is, B will be given by:

(1+r)B

=

RL

5

This means that at some low levels of debt it is cheaper for the

debtor to meet its obligation in full than to enter the bargaining
process, irrespective of the state of nature.

Because the debtor

would never choose to default, the risk—free interest rate r will be
charged for any debt level lower than or equal to B.

In this framework, there is always a maximum amount of debt that
creditors are willing to hold.

The existence of this upper bound

follows from the fact that there is a maximum payoff that can be
obtained in the bargaining process (RH) and a larger loan will not

increase that maximum payoff, irrespective of the contractual interest
rate being charged.

Assuming the high-output state and the low-output

state both have the same probability of occurence, the maximum value
of debt, which we denote B, is obtained from:

(4)

B(1+r)

=

.S(RL

+ RH)

Any increase in B beyond B does not increase the expected payoff;
moreover, for any value of B higher than B the creditors will obtain
an expected return lower than the risk—free interest rate,
independently of the contractual interest rate.
For loans larger than B but smaller than B, we are in a situation

in which the debtor would default and enter the bargaining equilibrium
if the bad state occurs, but would repay in full in the good state.
this range, the supply curve will satisfy:

It is apparent that in this region r is a positive function of B.
Therefore, the shape of the supply curve will be as shown in Figure 1.

Note that the position of the supply curve is a function of the
second-period output in the debtor country, that is, of its capital
stock and endowment shock.

Being aware of that fact, the debtor

country will adjust its investment strategy to take account of the
repercussions on the credit supply function.

Before turning to the

debtor's decision, let us examine the changes in the supply function
induced by investment in the debtor country.

A change in the capital

stock will affect all B, B, and r(B) as follows:

is apparent that the direction of the shift in the supply

curve is determined by the signs of how the payoffs are affected for
creditors and debtors.

As we showed in the bargaining equilibriunt,

two cases are possible. In the first, an increase in the capital stock
of the debtor country increases the payoff for the creditor in both
states of nature, which shifts the supply curve outwards.

In the

second case, an increase in the capital stock of the debtor country
reduces the payoff for the creditor in both states of nature, which
shifts the supply curve inwards.
Notice that so far we have assunted that there is no outstanding
debt at the beginning of the first period.

However, this is a

generalization that can be niade without much effort.

Let B0 be the

previous outstanding debt and R0 be the repayment in the first period,
itself the outcome of bargaining between debtor and creditor.

Then

the new debt level that the creditor will be willing to hold must
satisfy:

But all the previous qualitative results are

In particular, investment in the debtor country will

still shift the supply curve in the ways described above.

III.

The Bargaining Equilibrium

If the debtor country decides to completely default on its debts,
it will suffer economic sanctions that would involve some disruption
of its international trade.

An extreme case is when trade is made

completely impossible, and the debtor country niust live under autarky
conditions.

This situation would clearly be an inferior one: debtors

lose all gains from international trade, and creditors can collect
none of the outstanding debt.

Therefore, there exists a possibility

of engaging in some form of international trade which would be
niutually advantageous.

Such arrangement would be one in which

creditors receive some debt repayittent, and the debtor country is

allowed to enter international trade under some conditions.

The

bargaining equilibrium developed in this section describes the outconie

of negotiations between the debtor and creditor under these
circumstances.
The trade model that we use essentially follows Ethier's (1982)
framework.

The two countries have an endowment of a primary product,

which is internationally tradable, and which, together with capital
(we exclude labor for simplicity), is used to produce the final,

nontradable product.

In this context, gains from trade are derived from increasing
returns in production generated by input diversity.iJ

To gain in

clarity, we are assuming that only the debtor country obtains gains
from trade.

Therefore, although a purely free trade equilibrium will

not generate any productivity benefit for the creditor country, the
bargaining equilibrium brings about some debt repayment and is
therefore beneficial for the creditor economy.

Note that, in a

free—trade regime, the creditor country may obtain intertemporal gains
from trade, derived from the ability to lend to or to carry out direct

investment in the developing country.
In the present context, both countries can abandon all
negotiations and produce and consume at their autarky levels.

These

therefore, any

bargaining equilibrium must satisfy the constraint of being preferred
to the autarky position by both parties.

We will apply the syuinetric

Nash bargaining equilibrium framework (see Roth (1979), Binmore (1987,
etc).

This bargaining equilibrium can be obtained by finding the

Pareto—optimal allocation that maximizes the product of gains from
trade, that is, of moving from autarky to a Nash bargaining
equilibrium.

Letting ZN denote the level of production under the Nash

equilibrium, and ZA denote the level of production under autarky, the
bargaining equilibrium is the solution to the following problem.

1/ In the case of several productive sectors, the value of , which
represents the elasticity of substitution between the different productive
inputs plays a key role to distinguish opposing effects of investment on
the bargaining outcome.

This framework assumes perfect contemporaneous information for

both parties. / Another full information framework that has been
applied to the debt problem is one in which the two parties make a

sequence of offers and counteroffers, while time spent in the process
is costly because of time discounting and depreciation of the
underlying product, such as in O'Connell (1987) and Bulow and Rogoff
(1988).

The existence of a "perfect equilibrium" in the latter type

of game has been shown by Rubinstein (1979).

Although the Nash

equilibrium is a static game, in which the demands from both parties
are made simultaneously, Binmore (1987) has showed that the perfect
equilibria approximate the Nash bargaining solution when the interval
between demands is short.

If the time discount rates of the two

parties differ, the perfect equilibria approximate an asymmetric Nash

bargaining equilibrium.
The symmetry in the production function implies that both inputs
will always be used in equal quantities for the debtor country in both
the free—trade and the bargaining regimes.

In a free trade regime the

relative price of the two inputs will be unity, because they are

We are interested in the sign of dX*/dK*, because that derivative
will deterittine investment decisions prior to the negotiation process.
If dX*/dK* is negative, investment has the negative (for the debtor)

side effect of increasing debt repayments, which reduces incentives to
invest.

We can identify this situation with the 'debt overhang"

prob1em./ By contra*st,*if dX /dK

is positive, investment helps the

debtor country to obtain a more favorable outcome from the bargaining,
and the existence of large or nonserviceable debt has in fact a
positive incentive effect for investment and production.

Therefore, dX*/dK* is positive

elasticity of substitution is greater than one.

The intersection of both schedules gives the bargaining
*

At this allocation a marginal change of X will cause

percentage losses of the gains from trade to one party that equal the
percentage gains to the other party.

Note that investment by the

debtor will affect the DD schedule, and the resultant bargaining
equilibrium.

To trace the consequences of the investment on the DD schedule
one should evaluate both the change in the marginal and the average
gains from trade i.e., the TG*F (X*) and the TG*(X*), respectively.

Direct derivation reveals that investment will reduce (increase) the
marginal gains from trade (TG*, (X*)) if the elasticity of substitution
between capital and the aggregate inputs exceeds (falls short of)
unity, and will stay intact if the elasticity equals unity.

It turns

out that these factors dominate the behavior of the DD curve, which
will shift downward (upward) for the elastic (inelastic) case.

The

unitary elasticity case is the borderline case, where the (percentage)
15

gains from trade are independent from the aggregate capital stock, due
to the multiplicative nature in which capital enters the production
process.

Figure 3 is also useful to highlight the role of stochastic
endowments.

Note that a rise in the total endowment of the debtor

will have the consequence of widening the bargaining region, and
shifting curve CC horizontally by the increase in endowment to C'C'.
The bargaining outcome will increase by less than the endowment
increase, making both the debtor and the creditors better of f.

IV.

The Debtor's Problem

The debtor country faces the problem of choosing consumption and
investment in a forward-looking way.

In addition to standard

optimality considerations, the debtor country will choose the level of
investment that positions it advantageously for the bargaining game
(if it were to take place.)

Recall that we work with a two—period

framework, where in the first period a free—trade regime prevails, but
in the second either the free—trade or the bargaining regime may
prevail.

Condition (27) equates the expected marginal product of capital
(measured in utility terns) with the sum of the benchnark donestic
interest rate (A1/A2) and the expected strategic effect of investnent.
The strategic effect of investhent is given by the change in
repayment in the bargaining regine (dR7dK*) weighted by the tenti A,
which iieasures the loss derived front a marginal increase in repayment

in the bad state, and is defined by the difference between two terns.

The first tern is the effect of the change in the availability of
traded inputs in the bargaining regine (neasured in utility units),
and the second is the change in the availability of traded inputs in
the free-trade regime as a consequence of the shift in the supply
curve.

Notice that A is always positive because both the marginal

utility of consunption and the marginal product of inputs are higher
in the lower output state.

Therefore, the effect of investnent on the

repayment in the bargaining regine is always the doninant one.
Conparing (27) to (23) it is easy to see that strategic
considerations affect the optinal value of the expected narginal
product of capital in two ways: the change in bargaining repayment and
the credit supply response.

These two effects are always of opposite

sign because if the change in repayment favors the debtor it must hurt

the creditor, which prompts a credit supply response that increases
the cost of borrowing.

But, as we have shown A to be positive, the

direct repayment effect always dominates the indirect credit supply
response.

Therefore, the strategic effect of investment depends on the

This

is true despite the fact that the debtor country could improve its

borrowing conditions by increasing investment spending because the
repayment effect is more powerful.

increases the bargaining power of the debtor (dR/dK*<O), new
investments generate a positive externality on the debt situation of
the country, and the strategic incentives will work toward an increase
in investment spending.

In this case, paradoxically, an increase in

investment spending by the debtor makes creditors less willing to lend

by increasing the risk of default. /
One should be cautious, however, in deriving conclusions from the

strategic positive incentive case.

In particular, it does not ixnply

This is because the fact that the debtor country faces an

upward-sloping credit supply function implies that the benchmark

V.

An Alternative Bargaining Equilibrium

In the bargaining model of Section II, the effect of a larger

capital stock on the payoff for the debtor depended on the elasticity
of substitution in production, in the context of a diversified input

trade model. However, the indeterminacy of the effect of higher
capital (or output) on the bargaining payoff appears to be fairly

robust. In this section we provide another example in which trade
takes place in final goods (there are no primary inputs) and the sane

indeterminacy holds.
We assume that there are two final goods in the world economy:

good D produced by the debtor country, and good F, produced by the

creditor country. The two goods are perfect substitutes for the
creditor country, while the debtor country has a preference for good
F. More precisely, the utility function of the debtor country is

given by:

(29)

u

=

u(D+aF)

where a>1, and the utility function of the creditor country is given
by:
23

(30)

V

= v(D+F)

The above utility functions imply that in a free-trade regime the
relative price of the two goods is unity and the debtor country
exports all of its output (we will assume throughout that F >

The bargaining equilibrium will consist in obtaining

the value of x that represents the outcome of the symmetric power

The equilibrium value of x has to satisfy two restrictions.

because otherwise the debtor country would be better of f by breaking
of f negotiations and consuniing its own output in autarky.

Therefore,

the debtor's threat point is x = 1/a.
With x lying in the above range, creditors buy as much of the D
good as they can get, and debtors buy as much F good as they can
afford.

Therefore, since we assume that F >

equilibrium, the creditor country consumes all the output of good D
and part of the output of good F.

Thus, the consumption bundle (D,F)

obtained by the debtor country is given by (O,xD), and the consumption
bundle obtained by the creditor country is given by (D,F—xD).
The Nash bargaining equilibrium for this game can be obtained by
solving the following maxiniization problem:

in the sign of dx/dD.

incentives.

This is the relevant relation for investment

If dx/dD is negative, a larger output in the debtor

country increases the share of it going to the creditor in the

bargaining outcome.

In this case, we are in the presence of a "debt

overhang" situation in which incentives to investment by the debtor
country are reduced because of the larger transfer of resources to
creditors in the event that a bargaining situation should arise in the
future.

By contrast, if dx/dD is positive, the total return to

investment for the debtor increases because of the positive effect of
larger output on the payoff obtained by the debtor in case of
bargaining.

D increases the threat point of the debtor, which is the minimum
payoff it could obtain, thus contributing to a more favorable outcome
for the debtor country.

But on the other hand, if the increase in 0

implies that the marginal gain from a change in payoffs increases more
for the debtor than the creditor, the final outcome will be more
favorable to the creditors.

Therefore, even

that an increase in the debtor country's output generates

This

fact is reassuring, because otherwise the debtor country could make
itself better off by destroying part of its output, and the bargaining
equilibrium would not be well characterized.

VI.

Conclusions

Our examples lead us to conclude that the strategic consequences
of investment are rather involved and cannot be determined without
detailed knowledge of the economy.

The possibility that an actual or

potential movement into a bargaining regime can either encourage or
discourage investment for strategic reasons appears to be quite
general.

This result qualifies the arguments for a debt overhang

disincentive effect on investment.

But, once again, it should be

stressed that the strategic effects are additional to the disincentive
to investment caused by an upward—sloping credit supply curve and
credit rationing.

1+x>O.

Another important aspect of the problem, which we did not touch
in this paper, is the effect of the sectoral composition of
investment.

In this case, investment has a predictable effect:

investirient that increases the weight of the sector that is more (less)

trade dependent will generate the strategic tax (subsidy) effect (see
Aizenman (1988)).

This suggests that greater attention should be

given to the sectoral composition of investment in any attempt to link
the availability of new credit and investment.
An important policy implication of this paper is that one cannot
count on initiatives that reduce the burden of past debts to
automatically improve incentives for investment in indebted countries.
This may be the case for certain countries but does not necessarily
hold for all.

More generally, one would expect that, for strategic

reasons, the debt overhang depresses certain types of investment and
encourages others.

Although this situation would not be an optimal

resource allocation in a free trade, no risk of default regime, it may
still be the case that, for some countries, the depression of
investment is more closely related to a shortage of savings generated
by international credit constraints and low domestic savings.

In this

case, for example, policies that encourage domestic savings would have
a much larger impact on domestic investment than a change in the
incentive structure arising from the debt overhang.
Our analysis suggests that the consequences of the debt overhang
for aggregate investment may be ambiguous in value.

For example, a

rise in investment triggered by strategic considerations may in fact
30

reflect an attempt by the debtor country to increase its future
bargaining power, and will result in lower repayments.

A related

example would be an increase in international reserve holdings by the
debtor country.

Therefore, factors such as the composition of

investment may provide a better signal about prospects for future
repayment.
