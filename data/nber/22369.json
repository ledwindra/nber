    "abstract": "\n\nA large literature in empirical public finance relies on \u201cbunching\u201d to identify a behavioral response to non-linear incentives and to translate this response into an economic object to be used counterfactually. We conduct this type of analysis in the context of prescription drug insurance for the elderly in Medicare Part D, where a kink in the individual\u2019s budget set generates substantial bunching in annual drug expenditure around the famous \u201cdonut hole.\u201d We show that different alternative economic models can match the basic bunching pattern, but have very different quantitative implications for the counterfactual spending response to alternative insurance contracts. These findings illustrate the importance of modeling choices in mapping a compelling reduced form pattern into an economic object of interest.\n\n",
