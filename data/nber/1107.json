    "abstract": "\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to determine whether a two-tier exchange rate regime is more effective than a fixed rate regime in increasing acountry's ability to pursue an independent monetary policy in the short run.The analysis compares adjustment to a monetary policy and to a devaluation in the two exchange rate regimes in a portfolio model under imperfect asset substitutability. It is shown that the two policies have in the short run larger effects on interest rates under a two-tier regime. The duration of this effect, however, is longer under a fixed rate regime. The analysis is conducted for the case of static and rational expectations, demonstrating that the above results do not depend on the expectation mechanism.\n\n",
