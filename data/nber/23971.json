    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the relationship between parents\u2019 access to family planning and the economic resources of their children. Using the county-level introduction of U.S. family planning programs between 1964 and 1973, we find that children born after programs began had 2.8% higher household incomes. They were also 7% less likely to live in poverty and 12% less likely to live in households receiving public assistance. A bounding exercise suggests that the direct effects of family planning programs on parents\u2019 resources account for roughly two thirds of these gains.\n\n",
