    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents a dynamic model of political competition between two \"parties\" with different policy preferences. A \"party\" is explicitly modeled as a sequence of overlapping generations of candidates, all of whom face finite decision horizons. In general, there is a conflict between the interests of the individual policymakers and those of the \"party\" , which includes subsequent generations of candidates. We characterize this conflict and suggest a scheme of \"intergenerational transfers\" within the party which can resolve or mitigate this conflict. The paper shows how the \"overlapping generations\" model can be usefully applied to the political arena.\n\n",
