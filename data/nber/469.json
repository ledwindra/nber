    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents and analyzes the data on the trends in United States international trade and investment since World War II. From this data we can perceive a shrinking United States fraction of manufacturing output and exports, a return to and strengthening of lines of comparative advantage, and balanced and rapid growth in long-term investment. We can also see increasing volatility of trade and long-term investment in the 1970s, along with a real depreciation of 25 percent in the weighted United States exchange rate.\n\n",
