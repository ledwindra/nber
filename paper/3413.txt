RIJMAN CAPITAL, PRODUCT QUALITY,

AND

GROWTH

ABSTRACT

A growth model is developed in which finite-lived individuals invest in
human capital1 and investments have a positive external effect on the human

capital of later cohorts, Heterogeneous labor is the only factor of
produotion, and higher-quality labor produces higher-quality goods,
Stationary growth paths, along which humen ospital and the quality of
consumption goods grow at a common, constant rate, are studied.

It is also

shown that if a small eoonomy is very advanced or very backward relative to
rhe rest of the world, then its rate of investment in human capital is lower
uuder free trade than under aurarky.

In many of the most successful of the newly industrialized economies,

countries like Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong rapid growth in per
capita income has been accompanied by rapid expansion in the volume of
exports, rapid growth in education, and rapid changes In the composition of

curput. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model that is
useful fot studying this phenomenon,

In the model developed here, heterogeneous labor, differentiated by

level of human capital, determines a country's comparative mdvsntagej
Empirical work supports this idea. Cross-country differences in hitean
capitat are large and are systematically related to patterns of production

sud trade. Leamer (1984), for example, finds that separating labor into
three categories, defined in terms of human capital, is important in
explaining world trade patterns for manufactured goods.2

In much of the existing literature on long-run growth, labor of
different skill levels is assumed to be perfectly substitutable in

production. That is, one hour of labor with human capital K is token to be
perfectly substitutable for K hours of labor with human capital of unity.

Under this assumption, relative wage rates for labor of different types is

determined entirely by the production technology. This simplifying device
is useful for many putposes, but it puts severe limitations on the role
international trade can play in determining incentives to invest in human

capital. In the model developed here, wage rates are affected by the
supplies of labor of various types, as well as the demands. The technology
for human capital accumulation is important for determining the former;
preferences and the technology for goods production for the latter.

The technology for human capital accumulation used here is one that
distinguishes between the private human capital of individuals and the stock

uf knowledge of society as a whole. An individual accumulates human capital
by investing- - going to school- -when young. His level of human ospital upon

leaving sohool and entering the workforce depends en the length of thIs

investment period, which he chooses and on the effectiveness of the time
spent, which is determined by the social stock of knowledge available. His
level of human capital upon entering the wntkforce determines his wage rate

over the rest of his life, which he spenda working. Thus his choice shout
the length of the investment period is made by balancing the opportunity
cosf of later entry into the workforee against higher wage rate apid to sore
skilled labor. Private investment in schooling also has an external effect:
it causes growth in the social stock of knowledge, which increases the

effectiveness of tixe spent in school by later cohorts. Since individuals
are finite lived, the external effect is the only source of steady-state
growth.

Imperfect substitutability smeng different types of labor is modelled
here by allowing higher-quality labor to perform more highly valued

services. Specifically, there is a continuum of goods, differentiated in
terms of quality, where quality is defined in terms of Lancasterian (1966)

characteristics. Labor is the only factor of production, and only hfghor-

skill labor can produce higher-quality goods. In this setting, as aggregate
human capital grows, output growth consists of dropping lower-quality goods

iron production and adding higher-quality gonds. Houaehold preferences over
characteristics, together with the production technology, determine a

.

.

dertved
demand for labor services of varrous skill levels.

The model below is developed first for a closed economy. Existence is
proved for a stationary growth path, a competitive equilibrium in which
human capital and the quality of consumption goods grow at a common,

constant rate, It is also shown that if the external effect of investment
is sufficiently small, then the equilibrium is unique. In this case,
changes in the discount tate, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution,
and the productivity of the technology for human capital accumulation affect
the equilibrium growth tate in sensible ways.

The effect of free trade is then examined for a small economy, under
the assumption that the rest of the world is following a stationary growth

path. It is shown that if the small economy is initially much less
developed or ouch more developed than the rest of the world, then a shift
from autarky to free trade slows its rate of human capital accumulation.

The test of the paper is organized as follows. In section 1 the
environment is described, and in section 2 competitive equilibria are

defined. Stationery growth paths are described In section 3, and the
existence and uniqueness of such paths is established in

section 4.

The

small open economy is examined in section 5. Section 6 contains concluding
comments, The proofs of all theorems are gathered in the Appendix.

1. The Envi:grrient

In this section the economic environment is described. Continuity
restrictions end other technical issues are ignored, since they do not arise
in the anslysis of ststionary growth paths.

The model is formulated in continuous time, beginning at date t —

1.

The economy is composed of many, identical, infinitely-lived households,
each composed of an infinite stream of continuously-overlapping generations.
Each generation is the same

size,

and each individual lives for one unit of

time. Hence the size and demographic composition of the population are

4

constant ovar time.

The size of each cohort is normalized to unity, so the

size of the population at each date is also unity.
tonsumption and time allocation decisions are made by the honsehold.

Its preferences over infinite consumption streams are stationary and
additively separable over tiree, with a constant tate of pure time

preference. There is no utility of leisure, so the tine of every individual
in every generation is allocated in a way that maximizes the individual's
contribution to household income,

At the beginning of his life an individual can spend time investing in
human capital. The effectiveness of this investment depends ,upon the stock

of knowledge in society while the investment is undertaken. Let 0(t)

t a 0, denote the stock of knowledge at date t, and let (t) C [0,1]
denote the amount of time invested by members of cohort t. Then

GCt)[(t)] is the human capital of sn individual who is born at date t and
spends fi(t) units of time investing.

Assuisotion 1 The function : [01] -'

is strictly

increasing, strictly

concave, and twice continuously differentiable, with <0) —

I.

There is no soquisition of human capital on-the-job,5 so the individual's
human capital is constant nver his working lifetime, the inter-vel of time
[t ÷ fi(t), t + 1].

The stock of knowledge 0(t) grows over time at a tate that depends
upon previous cohorts' decisions about investment in human capitsi. As
noted above, this external effect provides the only "engine of growth." For
simplicity, it is assumed that the rate of growth of the initial endowment
at date t depends only on the investment decision of members of cohort tl:

The size and composition of the workforce at each date is described by

a function L(z,t), a a 0, t a 1, where L(z,t) is the number (mess) of
individuals in the workforce at date t who have human capital of at least a.
That is, L(. ,

it follows from (I) that the stock at date t is bounded. Rence for each
t

is bounded. Over intervals where L(' ,

c)

is

differentiable, .3L(z,t)/dz is a density function for skills in the
vorkforoe. Each discontinuity in L(. ,

t)

corresponds to a mass of workers

with the same level of skill. Figure 1 depicts a typical cumulative
distribution function for skills and its derivative. There is s continuous

distribution of workers in each of the intervals )t1,z2] and [z4,z5), and
there is a mass of workers with skill level

Goods are valued for the characteristics they tontain, At each date
there is a continuum of goods and a continuum of characteristics, both

indexed on R÷. A unit of the good of quality z provides one unit of each

of the characteristics f C O,z, so higher-index goods are better in the
eenae that they provide aore characteristics. The allocation at every date
is described by a function Q(z,t), z

0, t a 1, where Q(z,t) is the

cuantity nf goods consumed at date t that have quality of at least a.

Therefore, like L(.,t), the function Q(',t) is a right cumulative
distribution function, so it is nonincreasing and left-continuous. For
reasons that will become apparent below, the bnund on skill at each date
will also be a bound on the quality of goods available at that date.

Since each unit of each good of quality a end above contains one

unit of characteristic a, Q(z,t) is quantity of characteristic a
contained in the allocation at date t. Over intervals where Q(' ,t) is
differentiable, -aQ(z,t)/da is a density function for the quality levels
of goods in the allocation. Each discontinuity in Q(' ,

i)

corresponds to a

tease point of consumption goods of the same quality level. The two panels
of Figure 1 can, without change, be interpreted as depicting a typical
allocation of characteristics (the cumulative function) end the
corresponding allocation of goods (its derivative).6
The technology is unchanging over time and displays constent returns
to scale at each date, Labor of various skill levels is the only input into

production. An individual with human capital a can produce (a flow of)
one unit of any good of quality less than or equal to a. Hence the
feasiblity constraint is

all z so,

t a 1.

In equilibrium, since higher-quality products will command higher prices,
each individual will produce the highest-quality he is capable of producing,
and (3) will hold with equality.

The utility function of the representative household is additively

separable over time, with a constant discount rate p > 0 and a constant
elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/a > 0. In addition, its
preferences over characteristics at each date are stationery over time,

additively separable, and symmetric. Hence, the intertemporal utility
function ham the form

Aesumotion 3 The function u is strictly increasing, (weakly) concave, and
twice continuously differentiable, with u(0) — 0

and u'(O) C m

It is important that u'(O) be finite, so that zero consumption of some
characteristics, end hence of some goods, is possible.

In the limiting case where u is linear, all characteristics ate
perfect substitutes.

In this case, let c(t) —

U[Q(.

Q(z,t)dz

denote the total quantity of characteristics consumed at date t. The
intertesiporal utility function in (4) then has the standard form

-pt _1_— [c(.t)]1 dt.

Definition A feasible allocation, given the initial conditions [0(t), $(t),

0 at < 1], consists of functions [0(t), $(t), L(z,t), Q(z,t), a a O,t a lJ
such that (l)-(3) hold and the integrals in (4) and (5) are well defined.

2, CompetitiVe Eouilibria

At each date t

goods of every quality level and labor of every skill level, Let P(z,t),

and W(z,t), t a 0, t

denote goods prices and wage rates, and let

t a 1, denote interest rates.
Firma, taking prices and wage rates as given, hire labor of various

skill levels and uaa it to produce goods of venous quality levels. Since
higher-quality goode always command strictly higher prices, a wotker with

human capital z always produces the good of quality t.

hence, in

equilibrium (3) holds with equality:

Firma earn no profits.

Households, raking as given wages, prices, inrerast rates, and the
stock of knowledge, make decisions about investments in human capital,

labor supply, and goods purchases. Households can borrow or lend at the
market rate of interest, and they have rational expectations (periect

foresight). The household's objective is to maximize its total utility, as
given by (4) and (5), subject to an intertemporal budget constraint.

First, consider the household's investment decisions. Since leisure
is not valued, each household member divides his time between human capital
accumulation end work with the objective of maximizing the present

value of his lifetime earnings--his contribution to family
income. If an individual born at data t, when the stock of knowledge is

discounted

0(t), invests for b units of time, then his human capital is 0(.t)(b),
and

he works over the time interval [t + b, t + lj.

paths

Therefore, given the

K(') and W(.,') for interest rates and wage rates, his investment

problem is

Hotice that in solving the investment problem, the household ignores the
external effect of its investment decision on the stock of knowledge. Since
the external effect is a function of the economy-wide average rate of
investment, and since each household is negligably small

relative

to the

10

whole economy, each household correctly perceives that its own investment
plans have no effect on the aggrefate.

3. Stationary Growth Paths
None of the existing theorems on existence of a competitive
oquilihriuie appear to apply to this system. The analysis below considers
the more limited issue of the existence of a stationary growth path, a
competitive equilibrium in which all cohorts inveet in human capital at a

constant rate , and the stock of knowLedge grows at the constant rare g(a)
due to the external effect.

the proof of existence of a stationary growth

path is as follows. Fix any constant rate of investment fl(t) —

and, without loss of generality, let 0(0) —

I.

Then the path 0(.) for

the stock of knowledge is given by (lob), and L(•,1), the distribution
function Lot skills in the workforce at date 1, can be computed from (2).

Let q() —

L(.,l).

Ic then follows immediately from (2) that the

distribution functions for skill at all later dates satisfy

(lot)

0, all t a 1.

The upper panel of Figure 2 depicts L(.;) at date 1 and at a date t when
the stock of knowledge hoe doubled. The doubling in human capital shifts
the distribution function to the right by a factor of two. The lower panel

of Figure 2 depicts the corresponding density functions. Since each

of the population Is normalized to unity, the size of the workforre is

constant at 1 -

a.

Hence I - a

is the height of each distribution

function and the area under each denaity functionS

Paths for wages end interest rates can then be constructed from the

marginal utilities of a household that consumes the allocation Q(. 0
L(',•) given by (10c), As will be shown below, the wsge profile also shifts
at the constant rate g(s), and the interest rate is constant. That is

Figure 3 displays the wage profiles corresponding to the quantities in
Figure 2.

The upper panel of Figure 3 shows the marginal utilities

wage profile W(. .1) at date 1. It also shows how wages change over tics.
Since the skill distribution shifts to the right by a factor of two by
date t,

the

wage profile also shifts to the right by a factor of two.

It can be shown that ClOd) and (lOe) imply that the invsstncnt problea

(7) has a stationary form. Therefore, the only equilibrium condition that
must be checked is the solution to this single maximization problers. If the

solution is , the constant investment rate fixed at the beginning of the
exercise, then there is a stationary growth path with investment rate a.
Thus, establishing the existence and uniqueness of a stationary growth path
involves establishing that a certain mapping from investment rates into

investment rates has one and only one fixed point. This mapping is

formally in the current section and analyzed in the next.
Let 0(0) — 1, fix en investment rate a a [0,1], and let q(.;a)

The final equilibrium condition involves the investment prohlem for a

path with investment rate ,

the stock of knowledge is given by (lob), the

wage profile by (lOd), snd the interest rate by (14). Hence the lifetime

The ratio (b)/(b) is the percentage rate of growth in human capital for
additional time invostod, for an individual who has already invested b. The
restriction in (15) ensures that for sufficiently low rates of investment,

this rate of growth is large. The restriction in (17) holds if the
technology for human capital accumulation shows strongly diminishing

returns: if '(b)/'(b) is large in ahsolute value. The restriction in
(1B) holds if the utility function fcr characteristics shows only wildly
diminishing returns: If u '(l)/u'(O) is close to unity. Under Assumption 5,
a statinnary growth path exists.12

Theorem 3 Let Asenieptiona 1 - 5

hold, Then there exists at least one

stationary growth path, and all stationary growth paths have investment

rates a* that lie in the interval (el).

The main ides of the proof is as follows. First (16) is used to show that,
for any rate of investment in the reef of the economy, the optiaal tate ci
investment for an individual exceeds e.

Hence there can be no stationary

growth path with a rate of investment less than e.

Then (17) and (18) are

used to show that, for etcnomy-wide investment rates exceeding e, the
individual's best response--the solution to (l5)--is unique. That is,
together (17) and (15) ensure that

is concave enough" to offset the

convexity of p(. a), so that (15) has only one local eaxioum. That
solution is a continuous function of a, so (15) defines a continuous
mapping from the interval [el] into itself. Fixed points of that rapping-and there rust be at least one--correspond to stationary growth paths.

Along a stationary growth path, the rate of growth of output, as
conventionally measured, is constant over tire. To see this, choose any two

Let Assumptions 1 - 5 hold, and suppose that the stationary

growth path is unique. Then a higher rate of time preference p leads to a
lower rate of investsaenr along the stationary path, as does a lower

elasticity of intertemporal substitution 1/s. If the production function

itixeatment

in

a Small Open Economy

In this section, the consequences of a free-trade policy are examined

for a small economy. Throughout the sectien, the stationary investment rats
a* is taken to be unique. The small economy and the rest of the world have
identical preferences and technologies, and initially each is following a

stationary growth path of the type described above. The two have different
initial stocks of knowledge, however, and knowledge does cot spill over
across international boundaries.
Without less of generality, let the stock of khowledge in the rest of
the world at date 0 be unity, 0(0) — 1,

Let ihe stock in the small economy

be 0(03 — 9 > 0. As long as autarky prevails, both regions invest at the

rate a*, both stocks grow at the rate g(a*), and the ratio C(t)/C(t) is
constant. If 9 s 1, however, then relative prices differ in the two

countries,

and there are potential (static) gains from tradej3

In the test of the world, a shift from autarky to free trade leaves
the paths for prices, wages, and the interest rate are unchanged. Hence the
rate of investment e* and the rate of growth of the stock of knowledge g(a*)

there are also unchanged. In the small economy, the shift does alter the
paths for prices and wage rates, and therefore doee alter incentives to

invest in human cmpital. The question, then, is whether a ahift to free

20

trade strengthens or weakens the incentives for human capital accumulation
'1-

in the small economy. That is, do individuals in the smell economy, under
free trade, choose to invest more or less than a*7
Recall that the investment problem for an individual born at date r in

the rest of the world is given by (15). Suppose that the smalt economy

a permanent shift to free trade at date r. Then the investaent
problem for an individual born at that date in the small country is similar,
makes

except

that the human capital term, the first argument of p in (15), must

be multiplied by 0.

(19)

Hence, the modified version of (15) takes the form

(b,;a*) —

J er5p[eR*5)(b);a*]da,

If Assumptions 1-5 hold, then for each > 0

the problem '%e[o 1b*)

has a unique solution (see Lemma 4 in the Appendix). This solution, call it

b*(0), lies on the interval (,l) and is characterized by the first-otder

condition II1rbt(0),6;a*] —0. The function b* describes the optimal rate
of investment for sn individual in the small economy as a function of the

relative size of the stock of knowledge there. By definition, b*(l) —

a*.

First, note that if the utility function u over characteristics is

linear, then (12) and (13) imply that p is linear. Hence the parameter
simply multiplies the expression on the right side of (19), so the optimal

investment rate is independent of 0. That is, b*(0) —

e*

all

> o,

Therefore, the stock of knowledge in the small economy grows at the rate

g(a*), and its relative position does not change. In this case free trade
has no effect on the investment rate or growth rate of the small economy, or
on its relative position over time.

21

The intuition behind this result is very

simple.

If u is linear,

then all characteristics are perfect substitutes. In effect, there is only
one characteristic, and higher-quality labor produces proportionately note

of it. Therefore, labor inputs of all quality levels are perfectly
substitutable, and there Is no incentive for dissimilar countries to trade.
Hence free trade does not affect investment or grcwth rstea.

If u is strictly concave, then (12) and (13) imply that p has a
strictly convex region between two linear regions. In this case, the
following additional restriction is needed.

Assueittion 6 '(b)/(b)

g(a*), all bc [0,1],

Asenieption 6 states that the percentage rate of increase in an individual's

human capital for incremental time investments aiways exceeds the percentage
reta of increase in the stock of (social) knowledge due to the exrernsl

effect as time passes. This restriction, like those made previously, holds
if the external effect is not too strong.
Theorema 6 - 8 describe the effects of free trade on the incentives to

invest in human capital in the case where u is strictly concave.

Note

that 9[b*(9)] deecribes the human capital upon entry into the labor
force, under free trade, for an individual in the small economy.

Theorem 6 If Assumptions i - 6 hold, then 9[b*(9)] is strictly
increasing in 9.

Let

Assumptions I - 6 hold, and ssaume that u is strictly

.

Then

— 1.

Theorem 6 states that under free trade the optimal final level of
human capital for an individual in the small economy is a strictly

increasing function of the stock of kncwledge there. It is reassuring to
find that the model delivers this sensible, if unsurprising, conclusion.

Theorems 7 and 8 imply that b*(8) is as sketched in Figure 4. Since the
relative position of the small economy improvss or deteriorates as b*(8)
•

exceeds or falls short of a*. this figure can be used to study the shortrun and long-run dynamics of the system.
The first part of Theorem 7 states that if the small economy is
sufficiently backward relative to the rest of the wotld, then the optimal
investment rate for an individual there is less than the steady-state rate

and is independent of the degree of relative backwardness. The intuition
behind this result is very simple. Since high-skill lahor is relatively
abundant in the rest of the world, the effect of free trade in the small
economy is to lower the relative price of the goods produced by high-skill

labor. Hence the incentives to acquire skill are reduced. The long-run
dynamics are then clear: the sash economy falls ever farther behind the
rest of tha world in terms of human capital. It does not follow, however,

that the small economy is made worse off by free trade. The gains from
trade may outweigh the loss from slower growth in human capital.

23

The second part of Theorea 7 states that if the small economy is
sufficiently highly developed relative to the rest of the world, then the
optimal investment for an individual there is less than a* and decreases

with the relative level of development.14 The intuition behind this result
is that even with modest levels of investment, individuals in the smsll
economy are highly skilled relative to labor in the rest of the world.
hence their opportunity cost of investment is high and theit optimal

investment rate is low. In the short-run,

then,

the stock of knowledge in

the snall economy grows at a rate less than g(at), and its relative

advantage shrinks. Theorem 8 provides information about the long-run
dynamics.

before, the welfare effects of free trade are ambiguous.
•

Figure 4

also provides information about the effect of free trade on

investment in a small open economy that begins with a stock of knowledge

just slightly larger (smaller) than the stock in the rest of the world. At
least in the short run, the small economy invests at a higher (lower) rate
than at, so its stock of knowledge diverges even farther from the stock in

the rest of the world. The long-run behavior of the system is also clear
from Figure 4: in genersl, there are an odd number of steady states,

including (at least) the points $ —
points alternating.

6. Conclusions
The model analyzed here has emphasized the role of decisions about

human capital accumulation in determining the rate of growth. Pithin this
context, international trade affects growth by affecting the incentives for

schooling or other investments in human capital. This view of growth and of
the relationship between trade and growth raises a number of questions.

Distinguishing between individual human capital and the aocial stock
of knowledge, as has been done here, allows a clearer discussion of ihe

incentives and aechacisns governing rhe growth of each, The individual
investment problem can be treated in a standard, decision-theoretic way, as
it has been bore. The growth in the stock of knowledge is more problematic,
however. Here it has been modeled simply as an external effect.
An interesting extension of the present work would be to introduce a
separate research activity, like new product development, that augments rho

stock ot knowledge. If both new blueprints end better-trained workers are
needed to produce higher-quality goods, then investments in R&D and
in conventional human capital are complementary, and the incentives

governing them are linked. The models of growth based on R&D in Aghion and
Hewett (1939) and Groesmen and Helpman (1939), for example, provide
frameworks within which conventional human capital might he incorporated.

The location of the external effect, here at s level that can be

called national, is also important. The presence of effects that are
external to the family immediately implies that the competitive equilibria
of the model are inefficient. Tee if trio investment is undertaken, so at
rhe margin, subsidies to education, child labor laws, and other policies
that encourage investment will raise welfare. Similarly, as shown in
section 5, the presence of effects that are internal to the nation implies

25

that free trade may adversely affect investment and growth. To the extant
that the externalities operate at a lower level, within the family. or at a
higher one, internationally, these contlusions will be changed.
The analysis above has stressed intreases in the quality of schooling
rathet than the quantity (years) as the source of long-run growth.

Conventional methcde of measurement pick up only the latter, however, and it
is far from obvious how the former tan be measured. In the ntndel above,
quality improveaentz can be determined from the shape of the age-earnings

profile. Rut if on-the-Job learning is present as well, then the ageearnings profile confounds the two. An interesting eopirical issue is how
increases in human capital due to improvements In the quality of schooling
might he measured.
The conclusion that trade may impede growth for a small, backward
economy also follows from a variety of other models In which static
comparative advantage determines patterns of long-run growth and trade.
Recent papers by Roldrin and Scheinlunan (1988), Krugman (1987), Lucas
(1988), Stokey (1989) • and Young (1989) have explored aodels in which

learning by doing Is the only source of productivity gains. If the
Industries in which the less developed country has a static comparative
advantage are industries In which there ate limited opportunities for
learning, then the affect of free trade is to speed up learning in the more

developed country and to slow it down in the less developed one. The aodel
here shows that similar reasoning applies when the external effect operates

at arm's length from the production process. An interesting question is
whether selective trade restrictions might ha useful In allowing a country
to protect the incentives to invest in human capital accumulation, while at

26

the same tiae allowing it to capture a substantial portion of the static
gains from trade.

Finally, it is clear that the production technology, which includes no
coaplementarities between labor of different skill levels, is important in

arriving at many of the concluaions. If such ceaplementarities were
present, and if trade in intermediate goods allowed them to he exploited
across international boundaries, then free trade might have very different
effects on the incentives for human capital accumulation.

Fpptnotes

A static model in which human capital accumulation determines comparative
advantage is developed by Findley and Kierzlcowski (1983) ,

who analyze a two

sector two-country model of trade in which unskilled labor and °classrosms"
are primary factors, and skilled labor is an intermediate product They do
not consider the issue of growth, however.

2 Learner's results confirm earlier work by Keesing (1966, 1971) analyzing

nba mix of labor skills in imports and experts of the indnstrialized
countries, and by Baldwin (1971), Branscn and Jutes (1911), and Waehrer

(1968) establishing that U.S. experts are intensive in the use of human
capital.

The model of threshold effects in Ararisdis and Drsren (1990) uses a
technology for human capital accumulatioc very similar to the one used here.

A similar framework io used in Stokey (1988) in a model of learning by
doing, and in Stekey (1989) in a static, twa-country model of trsds.

The assumption that no skills are acquired on the job leads to

an sdd age-

earnings profile: it is downward sloping aver the individual's entire

working lifetime. This could be remedied by incorpnreting some version cf
Rosen's (1976) medal of human capital accumulation. This would permit human
capital to grow after an individusl begins working, giving a more reasonable
age-earnings profile.

6 See

Stokey (1988) for a more derailed description of the relationship

between allocations of characteristics and goods, and of prices for
allocations of either sort.

The wage rates for types of lebot in zero supply are, within some range,

indeterminate. Equation (6) imposes a particular pricing convention for
these types of labor: they are priced at the lowest wage rate consistent
with zero demand by firms.

8 It is also possible to calculate total, discounted, family income by
calculating the total discounted income of each family member and then

aggregating across faoily members. Care must be taken to include the income
earned after date 1 by family members in cohorts t

[0,1).

Implicit in Clod) is a particular normalization for prices at each date:
they are normalized so that current output evaluated at current prices is
constant over time. The choice of normalization convention is, of course,
purely a matter of convenience, but it does affect the interest rate.

10 The

prices of goods in zero supply are, within some range, indeterminate.

Equations (12) and (13) impose a particular convention for them: they are
priced at the lowest price consistent with zero demand by households.

It The

supporting prices are unique, given the conventions for pricing

commodities in zero supply (see footnotes 7 and 10) and for normalizing spot
prices at each date (see footnote 9).

previcusly unproduced goods become available in the rest of the world.
Under autarky, the prices of these goods were, within some range.
indeterminate. Under the pticing convention in equations (12) and (13),
however (see footnote 10), the prices of these goods remain unchanged under
free trade with the small economy.
