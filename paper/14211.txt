ABSTRACT
Sizeable achievement differences by race appear in early grades, but substantial uncertainty exists
about the impact of school quality on the black-white achievement gap and particularly about its evolution
across different parts of the achievement distribution. Texas administrative data show that the overall
growth in the achievement gap between third and eighth grade is higher for students with higher initial
achievement and that specific teacher and peer characteristics including teacher experience and peer
racial composition explain a substantial share of the widening. The adverse effect of attending school
with a high black enrollment share appears to be an important contributor to the larger growth in the
achievement differential in the upper part of the test score distribution. This evidence reaffirms the
major role played by peers and school quality, but also presents a policy dilemma. Teacher labor market
complications, current housing patterns, legal limits in segregation efforts, and uncertainty about the
overall effects of specific desegregation programs indicate that effective policy responses will almost
certainly involve a set of school improvements beyond simple changes in peer racial composition and
the teacher experience distribution.

Harming the Best: How Schools Affect the Black-White
Achievement Gap
By Eric A. Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin
Perhaps no other social policy issue has been as important or as stubborn to deal with as
racial gaps in economic outcomes. Black-white differences in academic attainment, occupation,
and earnings, while showing some improvement over the past quarter century, have remained large.
Much of the policy effort aimed at reducing these gaps focuses on public elementary and secondary
schools. This emphasis hinges upon the widespread beliefs that school and peer characteristics
disadvantage blacks relative to whites and that appropriate interventions can raise achievement and
future life outcomes. This paper investigates the first of these beliefs through an examination of the
changes in the black-white achievement gap as students progress through school. The findings
suggest that the achievement gap increase across grades is larger for blacks with higher initial
achievement, and that this is due primarily to stronger deleterious effects for initially high
achieving blacks of attending schools with a high black enrollment share.
Differences by initial achievement in both the growth in the achievement gap and
relationship to school racial composition are striking and carry important implications for the future
education and earnings distributions. The expanding achievement racial gap as students progress
through school is fueled by relatively constant gaps at the bottom of the black and the white
distributions and a dramatically increasing gap at the top. Given the relationship between cognitive
skills and economic outcomes, the truncation at the top of the black achievement distribution does
not bode well for the future expansion of the number of blacks who complete college and graduate
school and who enter high prestige occupations and positions of power.
We begin with a description of the evolution of achievement differences by initial
achievement level, focusing on problems introduced by test measurement error induced regression
to the mean. We follow this with an investigation of the contributions of school and peer

2

characteristics to these changes, paying particularly attention to the possibility that the importance
of specific factors may differ by initial achievement. The findings indicate that both the growth in
the achievement gap and the effects of specific variables differ significantly by position in the
achievement distribution at entry to elementary school with the largest adverse impacts on blacks
who enter being the best prepared.

1. Economic Motivation
Table 1 provides a stark picture of the black-white differences in academic, economic, and
social outcomes that have survived the schooling policies of the last decades. Among men and
women 20 to 24 years old, blacks are far less likely to complete or be in the process of completing
college, far less likely to work, and far more likely to be in prison or other institutions. The rates of
incarceration and non-employment for young black men paint a particularly dire picture.
Cognitive skills appear strongly correlated with black and white gaps in school attainment
and in wages, and this has motivated aggressive policies to raise the quality of education for
blacks.1 The landmark decision in Brown v Board of Education that attacked racial segregation of
schools was the modern beginning of concerted federal, state, and local actions directed at
improving black achievement.2 Along with subsequent court cases, Brown ushered in a profound
change in both school and peer characteristics, while contemporaneous increases in school
spending, brought on in part by school finance litigation, further raised the resources devoted to
black students in the public schools. Nonetheless, racial disparities have been stubbornly resistant
to policy, raising the possibility that schools really cannot be effective policy instruments.3

O'Neill (1990) and Neal and Johnson (1996) provide evidence on wage differences, and Rivkin (1995)
provides evidence on differences in educational attainment. A more general review of the economic impacts
of cognitive skills on individual earnings is found in Hanushek and Wößmann (2008).

that convergence of earlier periods slowed or stopped in the 1980s and 1990s.

2. Strands of Literature on the Racial Achievement Gap
The original Coleman Report (Coleman et al. (1966)) was mandated by the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 and motivated by concerns about racial justice in the schools. It described a situation
where the gap in student performance, measured in terms of grade-level equivalents, expanded over
time. Its analysis, however, did not suggest that the achievement differences existing in 1965 had
much to do with the schools but rather were driven by family and peers.4 Its companion report, U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights (1967), focused on the role of racial concentration in the schools as a
primary factor in the existing achievement gaps.
This time period was also central to the development of several different policy thrusts that
were directly related to achievement gaps. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown was slow to be
implemented as many Southern districts resisted desegregation and as the Court repeatedly refined
and sharpened its message of 1954. As a result, the most significant changes in school
desegregation occurred in the late 1960s and during the 1970s (see Welch and Light (1987),
Clotfelter (2004)). Although the policy innovations were dramatic, the research on implications of
desegregation has been slower in coming. Much of the early work focused on the outcomes of
desegregative acts (court orders, busing programs, and the like) and failed to separate the
immediate reactions from the long term impacts. See, for example, Crain and Mahard (1978),
Cook (1984), Armor (1995), and the assessment in Linn and Welner (2007).
A second policy initiative also expanded the federal role in education, particularly for
disadvantaged groups. With the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, the
federal government entered into the funding and operations of schools more forcefully than ever
before, initiating compensatory education programs designed to bring up performance by

This analysis was subjected to considerable criticism; see, for example, Bowles and Levin (1968) or
Hanushek and Kain (1972).

disadvantaged students.5 A variety of assessments about the impact of these compensatory
programs for the disadvantaged raised questions about the effectiveness of ESEA, but it continued
to be one of the most significant federal education programs.6
The implications of these programs and other factors on the racial achievement gap have
not surprisingly received considerable attention. Studies of National Assessment of Education
Progress (NAEP) scores document a lessening of the black-white gap during the 1980s and early
1990s and a roughly stable gap thereafter.7 The impacts of specific family, school, peer, and
community factors on this pattern have been examined, but the limited and often contradictory
statistical evidence raises doubts about the efficacy of desegregation and other policies as
mechanisms for addressing racial inequalities.8
Research on “summer fall back” supports the notion that increasing achievement gaps
through the schooling years is largely not a product of the schools per se. This work, relying on
summer and fall testing of achievement, suggests that learning during the school year might on
average be the same for blacks and whites but that the amount of learning during the summer
months heavily favors white students (Heyns (1978), Downey, von Hippel, and Broh (2004),
Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson (2007)).

Federal involvement in school accountability under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is in fact the
latest reauthorization of the ESEA statutes.
6
Before each re-authorization, the federal government hired an outside evaluator to judge the effectiveness
of the compensatory funding. Invariably, these studies found little success in terms of achievement (see
Vinovskis (1999)). These findings dovetail with direct analyses of how school resources tend not to be
related to student outcomes (e.g., Hanushek (2003)).
7
See, for example, Congressional Budget Office (1986), Grissmer, Kirby, Berends, and Williamson (1994),
the collection of research in Jencks and Phillips (1998), and Hanushek (2001).
8
Earlier optimism about narrowing gaps (Jencks and Phillips (1998)) largely dissipated with new evidence
that the black-white achievement gap stayed constant or even grew during the 1990s (National Center for
Education Statistics (2005)). In terms of the specific policies that have been pursued, direct evidence on the
benefits of school desegregation remains limited. Review of the evidence surrounding desegregation actions
provides limited support for positive achievement effects (Schofield (1995)); Guryan (2004) finds that
desegregation reduced the probability of dropping out of high school, though data limitations and
methodological concerns raise questions about the findings. Accumulated evidence does not provide strong
support for the belief that higher expenditure typically leads to substantial improvements in the quality of
instruction, particularly with regard to higher pay for teachers with a masters degree or substantial experience
(Hanushek (2003)).

Other recent research generally provides additional support for that view. For example,
Fryer and Levitt (2004, (2005) find that a substantial racial achievement gap exists at entry to
school and increases with age but that the majority of the increase occurs within schools and is not
explained by quantifiable school characteristics.9 Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2005) document a
large third grade achievement gap in North Carolina that does not increase with schooling. Our
past work, on the other hand, highlights meaningful achievement impacts of specific peer and
teacher inputs whose distributions differ substantially by race, suggesting possible school based
explanations of at least a portion of the black-white achievement differences.10
The concentration on the average achievement gap, however, may mask important effects
that vary across the achievement distribution. For example, discussions of peer pressures on blacks
– the “acting white” literature – raises the possibility that high achieving black students may face
very different pressures than lower achieving blacks.11 In addition, academic preparation relative to
the median or mean student in the school likely affects the extent to which the curriculum
approaches the ideal level of challenge for a student. These and other considerations suggest the
possibility of differential responses across the initial achievement distribution to particular factors.

3. Texas Schools Project Data
The UTD Texas Schools Project (TSP) data set provides a unique stacked panel of school
administrative data that allows us to track the universe of Texas public elementary and middle
school students as they progress through school. For each cohort there are over 200,000 students in

Note that Murnane, Willett, Bub, and McCartney (2005) cannot replicate either the basic school patterns of
the achievement gap or the influence of measured family background on the gaps when they go to a different,
but in some ways richer, data base. Neal (2006) finds little evidence of a growing gap past entry to school and
discounts the role of schools in either creating or ameliorating any gaps.
10
Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2004) investigate the effects of student mobility; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain
(2005) investigate the effects of teacher experience; and Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2006) investigate the
effects of racial composition.

over 3,000 public schools. Unlike many data sets that sample only small numbers from each school,
these data enable us to create accurate measures of peer group characteristics. We use data on four
cohorts for grades three (the earliest grade tested) through eight. The most recent cohort attended
eighth grade in 2002, while the earliest cohort attended eighth grade in 1999.
The student data contain a limited number of student, family, and program characteristics
including race, ethnicity, gender, and eligibility for a free or reduced price lunch (the measure of
economic disadvantage). The panel feature of the data, however, is exploited to account implicitly
for a more extensive set of background characteristics through the use of a value added framework
that controls for prior achievement. Importantly, students who switch schools can be followed as
long as they remain in a Texas public school.12
Beginning in 1993, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) was administered
each spring to eligible students enrolled in grades three through eight. The tests, labeled criteria
referenced tests, evaluate student mastery of grade-specific subject matter. This paper presents
results for mathematics. Because the number of questions and average percent right varies across
time and grades, test results are standardized to a mean of zero and variance equal to one. Because
these tests cannot be used to measure knowledge growth with age, they provide no information on
absolute racial differences. If the variance in knowledge grows with age and time in school, as we
believe most likely, any deterioration in the relative standing of blacks on the achievement tests
would understate the increase in knowledge inequality.
The student database is linked to detailed information on teachers including grade and

12

Given the high rate of school switching, particularly among lower income and minority students, the
possibility of following movers is an important asset of the data. In contrast, such mobility presents a serious
sampling problem for survey data sets including the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS) that has
been used in recent work on the racial achievement gap (Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2005) and Reardon (2008)).
The descriptive analysis the ECLS data in Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) shows that blacks who move between
grades 1 and 3 in the ECLS sample exhibit larger test score growth than stayers, a pattern contrary to that
observed in most longitudinal data sets. This highlights the difficulty of generating a representative sample of
a mobile population. More generally, sample selection problems in survey data almost certainly grow in
magnitude with age.

subject taught, class size, years of experience, highest degree, race, gender, and student population
served. Although individual student-teacher matches are not possible, students and teachers are
uniquely related to a grade on each campus. Students are assigned the average class size and the
distribution of teacher characteristics for teachers in regular classrooms for the appropriate grade,
school, subject, and year.
We also exclude students with any missing grade-appropriate test observations, making
two aspects of the data important for the subsequent comparisons. First, differential rates of special
education placement directly affect the achievement comparisons because of the higher incidence
among blacks. Second, we exclude all students retained in grade at any point between grades three
and eight. Because the tests are not vertically linked across grades, it is not possible to locate a
grade g test score in a grade g+1 distribution. Consequently, since blacks are more likely to be
retained in grade, the resulting sample of blacks is further positively selected relative to the sample
of whites.
The pattern of grade retention and exclusion from tests, shown in Appendix Table A1, has
implications for the description and analysis of racial achievement gaps.13 Specifically, because of
the racial differential, it is necessary to interpret the descriptive patterns as understating the full
extent of racial achievement differences, particularly differences in the shares of students in the
lower tail of the distribution.

4. Racial Achievement Differences in Texas
We begin with descriptive information about the achievement gaps as students progress
from third to eighth grade in Texas public schools. Because of our interest in distributional issues,
however, it is necessary to discuss first the approach used to divide students by initial achievement

As Hanushek and Rivkin (2006) show, the achievement gap of students who progress with their class
understates black-white differences in academic progress at any point in time given the much higher rates of
grade retention and missing tests due primarily to special education classification (particularly for boys)
among blacks. For test taking and placement in special education, see Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2002).

score. The impact of test measurement error evokes particular concern, because it is complicated by
the substantial difference in initial achievement distributions by race.
A. Division by Initial Achievement
By dividing the third grade achievement distribution into quartiles, systematic variation in
the change in the achievement gap between third and eighth grades across initial achievement
categories can be identified. This is complicated, however, because test scores measure actual
knowledge with error. This means two individuals with identical knowledge can be placed into
different categories if one is lucky and the other unlucky in guessing or having been exposed to
specific vocabulary words or mathematics problems. If such errors are uncorrelated over time,
those initially placed in high achievement categories (partly on the basis of “good” errors) will tend
to draw less positive errors in the subsequent year and have lower average achievement gains than
those initially placed in lower categories.
Such regression to the mean also complicates black-white comparisons by achievement
level because of race differences in the actual initial skill distributions. Table 2 illustrates the
general problem using a stylized bivariate distribution of actual skill and measurement error that is
randomly distributed and does not differ by race. The top panel reports the assumed distributions of
actual skill for blacks and whites, where the distribution for blacks is more concentrated in the
lower categories than the distribution for whites. The bottom panel describes the resulting
distribution of observed test scores, where Pij is the probability that somebody with true ability in
category i is observed in category j. Importantly, these identical conditional probabilities are
assumed for blacks and whites, based on the assumption that the distribution of test errors does not
differ by race.
Given the assumptions regarding race differences in knowledge and measurement error,
the bottom panel illustrates that a higher proportion of whites than blacks are misclassified into the
lower observed skill category, while the opposite is true for the highest observed skill category. A
higher percentage of the blacks in the lower achievement category are classified correctly, while a

higher percentage of the whites have negative errors. In contrast, a higher percentage of the whites
in the high achievement category are correctly classified, while a higher percentage of the blacks
have positive errors. This implies that the average errors for blacks in each observed achievement
category are higher than the average errors of whites. Because the expected error in the next period
is zero if test errors leading to are uncorrelated over time, the expected achievement gain in the next
period is higher for whites than for blacks throughout the observed initial skill distribution.
Therefore a finding that the gap grows in each category would be expected even if there was no
increase in the true knowledge differential.
The pattern illustrated in Table 2 invalidates the simple categorization of students on the
basis of initial mathematics test scores. To overcome this problem, we use a test in a different
subject to categorize students by initial skill level, based on the assumptions of positive correlations
across subjects in true skill and of no correlation in the test measurement errors across subjects.
This approach severs the link between initial category and expected difference in the error
realizations for the initial and subsequent periods if the assumption of uncorrelated errors is true.
However, the extent of teaching to the test, the probability of cheating (particularly by teachers),
and the likelihood a student is ill (different subject tests are administered on adjacent days), are
probably similar across subjects, raising the possibility of correlated errors and potentially
invalidating this approach to categorizing students.14
The determination of the group cutoffs provides an additional issue to resolve. Because the
distribution for whites has less dispersion than that for blacks and because there are far fewer blacks
in the sample, we chose to divide the sample on the basis of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of third
grade test scores computed only over the sample of blacks. This leaves blacks split almost evenly
into the four categories, while whites are concentrated in the highest quartile.
B. Growth in the achievement gap

Notice that even if the errors are not correlated, this approach provides valid estimates of changes over
time in the achievement gap and not of the magnitude of differences at any point in time.

14

10

Table 3 reports the evolution of the black-white achievement gap for all students combined
and by initial test score quartile. Note the particularly large change between third and fourth grade
in the top half of the distribution, suggesting that simply using the reading score for categorization
is insufficient. Given both a priori concerns about correlated errors and this initial investigation,
we drop third grade changes and focus on changes between grades 4 and 5 and between grades 8
and 9.
A clear pattern emerges showing similar increases between grades 4 and 5 across the initial
achievement distribution but much larger increases between grades 5 and 8 in hither initial score
categories. Between grades 4 and 8 the gap rises by only 0.02 standard deviations for students in the
lowest initial achievement group, by 0.08 for students in the 2nd group, by 0.11 for students in the
third group, and by 0.14 for students in the top initial achievement quartile. The larger increase for
initially high achievers raises serious concerns about the existence of academic opportunities for
some students striving to succeed and motivates our detailed investigation.

5. The Impact of Teacher and Peer Effects on Achievement Gaps
The role of schools in affecting the evolving racial achievement gap is controversial. Prior
work suggests uncertainty about whether the racial gap expands or contracts with schooling. More
importantly, since the earliest work on achievement gaps in Coleman et al. (1966), pinpointing any
specific school influences has proven difficult. On the other hand, external factors have seemed
clearer, such as the case of summer achievement fallback (cf. Downey, von Hippel, and Broh
(2004), Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson (2007)).
We investigate the extent to which specific teacher and school variables account for the
growth in the achievement gap during the school years and differences by initial third grade
achievement. Our primary goal here is to assess whether schools have a discernible impact on the
growth of the racial achievement gap. We focus on teacher experience and school proportion black.
These two school factors have been previously shown to be significant determinants of

achievement and to be distributed differently by race. Further, we have a strategy for credible
identification of these effects. While other school factors may also be important, investigation of
these specific factors is the natural extension of previous analyses.15
The potential import of these two factors is readily apparent in Table 4. Blacks are more
likely than whites to have teachers with little or no experience and on average attend school with a
much higher black enrollment share, regardless of initial achievement quartile.
Interestingly, there is little or no systematic variation in initial achievement of blacks
across schools of differing proportion black, raising doubts about the importance of demographic
composition as a determinant of achievement. However, as Table 5 shows, a pronounced
relationship develops as students age. By eighth grade the average black math score equals -0.15
for students in schools that are less than 25 percent black, -0.28 in schools in which the black
enrollment share lies between 25 and 50 percent, and -0.40 in schools that are majority black. Our
question is how much of this divergence is caused by demographic composition and how much is
caused by other school and family factors.
A. Empirical Model
Identifying the effects of teacher and peer characteristics on achievement is difficult
primarily because the distribution of peer and teacher variables is not an accident but rather an
outcome of government, teacher, and family choices. Their endogeneity impedes efforts to isolate
exogenous variation in these variables.

Note that by concentrating on these two factors we ignore other components of schools such as school
leadership that are likely distributed more favorably for whites than blacks. We return to this below.

Our approach takes advantage of the stacked panel data from the Texas Schools Project to
account for systematic factors related to choices by schools and parents that affect teacher and peer
characteristics on the one hand and achievement on the other. The underlying value added models
use the quasi-random variation in teacher and peer characteristics that remains following the
removal of the multiple levels of fixed effects to identify the effects of specific peer and teacher
characteristic.
Equation (1) highlights the key identification issues that must be addressed in the absence
of random assignment. Here achievement ( AiGsy ) for student i in grade G and school s in year y is
modeled as a function of student, family, school, and peer factors:
(1)

AiGsy = α iGy + β X iGsy + δ SiGsy + λ PiGsy + eiGsy

where P is peer composition, S is school quality (including teacher quality) in grade G, X is a vector
of flows of contemporaneous family background during grade G, α is an individual-specific
intercept specific to grade G in year y that captures the cumulative effects of family, neighborhood,
and school experiences and characterizes the knowledge and skills that each student separately
brings at entry to grade G, and e is a stochastic term capturing other unmeasured influences.
If P and S were uncorrelated with e and α,, OLS would yield unbiased estimates of the
effects of peer and school characteristics. But as noted above, the complications inherent in the
sorting of students, teachers, and administrators among schools – combined with existing evidence
about the importance of each – strongly suggest that typically available variables contained in X
will not account adequately for potentially confounding factors.
Our approach is to use the panel data techniques to control for student, family, school, and
community factors that could potentially bias the estimated effects, leaving only exogenous
variation in the variables of interest to identify the parameter estimates. Specifically, because we
follow students over time and observe how different students perform in given schools, we can

13

remove systematic components of student, school, and peer factors by including a series of fixed
effects in the model.
Perhaps the easiest way to see it is by considering the introduction of a school fixed effect –
or separate intercept for each school – that captures time invariant differences in neighborhoods
and schools, many of which are likely related to both achievement and school racial composition.
These include school facilities, public services, community type, and working conditions that
influence teacher supply.
But, because school quality undoubtedly varies over time and by grade for each school, we
also includes interactions between school and both grade and year.16 School-by-grade fixed effects
capture any systematic differences across grades in a school that are common to all years, including
elements of curriculum, testing programs, and grade retention policies. The school-by-grade fixed
effect also accounts for the possibility that achievement and racial composition vary systematically
with age due to potentially confounding factors, as would be the case if white exit from schools
rises at the same age as achievement of blacks declines because of influences other than school
racial composition. School-by-year fixed effects account for systematic year-to-year differences
that are common to all grades in a school. These school-by-year fixed effects remove not only
school trends in a very general way but also idiosyncratic variation over time. For example,
changes in school administration and in neighborhood and local economic conditions that might
affect mobility patterns (including such things as the introduction of new race-related school
policies or the myriad changes documented to occur in “transitional neighborhoods”) are all
captured by these fixed effects without having to resort to available but imperfect proxies for each.
An economic shock that reduces neighborhood employment and income would not bias the
estimates; nor would a shock to local school finances or the quality of the local school board,
because each of these would affect all grades in a school.

Note that we discuss both school and school-by-year fixed effects purely for expositional purposes. It is
not possible to estimate both jointly.
16

14

It is also important to account for statewide factors that might be correlated with overall
changes in racial composition and achievement. Grade, year, and year-by-grade fixed effects
account for statewide trends in racial composition and achievement by grade and year and other
factors including changes in test difficulty, accountability policies, textbooks and curriculum, and
the like.
These fixed effects go significantly beyond studies that attempt to characterize differences
in schools, neighborhoods, and policies by various direct measures of their attributes. Nonetheless,
they do not account for grade specific, time varying factors that might be related to peer racial
composition or teacher experience.
A clear and important example of possibly confounding effects would be any selective
placement of students into classrooms that is correlated to both unobserved determinants of
achievement on the one hand and classroom teacher or student characteristics on the other.
Consider the possibility that parents who are stronger advocates for their children may be more
likely to succeed in placing children with experienced teachers. Alternatively, principals may be
more likely to place high achieving blacks in racially mixed classrooms. To deal with this potential
problem, we restrict attention to variations in racial composition and teacher attributes at the grade
rather than classroom level. This use of grade rather than classroom level information is closely
related to the use of grade average percent black as an instrumental variable, although the IV
estimator would also use within grade black-white differences in the classroom proportion black in
the computation of standard errors.17
A second concern not addressed by aggregation to the grade level is the possibility that a
spurious correlation is introduced between achievement and the variables of interest as a result of

Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor (2003) find significant variations in the racial composition of classrooms by
district, school, classroom, and academic track in middle school but much less so in primary school. Their
descriptive analysis does not address implications for student performance, but, given our inclusion of
school-by-year and school-by-grade fixed effects in regressions estimated separately by race, any such
variation likely has a negligible effect on the estimates in this paper. Because our data do not include
classroom identifiers, classroom differences cannot be used in this analysis.

parental decisions to switch schools. If the presence of more inexperienced teachers increases the
likelihood that families leave the school, it becomes difficult to separate the influence of attrition
from the true effect of teacher inexperience.
Bias from such selection emerges only if the selection is related systematically to within
school-by-grade differences over time in the variables of interest and, importantly, to unobserved
determinants of achievement. The fact that teacher assignments and other relevant aspects of
school decisions are frequently not known until immediately prior to the beginning of school year
argues against the presence of this potential source of bias. Moreover, transactions costs and the
presence of multiple children in the majority of families would tend to limit family mobility in
response to concerns about school quality for a single grade, even if relevant teacher and classroom
assignments were known in a timely manner.18 Nonetheless, we do account directly for student
heterogeneity as we describe below.
The variation used to identify the parameter estimates can be illustrated by considering
racial composition for a single school (In a more general case with multiple schools, the
coefficients would reflect the average of these within-school relationships across the sample). With
multiple years of data for one grade, we could use cohort differences in achievement and racial
composition to identify the racial composition effect. However, unobserved changes over time
could bias the estimates produced by this school-by-grade fixed effects model. Alternatively, with
multiple grades of data for a single year, we could use grade differences in achievement and in
racial composition to identify the racial composition effect. However, systematic differences by
cohort or grade could bias the estimates produced by this school-by-year fixed effects model.
Fortunately, the availability of data for multiple years and grades permits the simultaneous
inclusion of school-by-grade and school-by-year fixed effects. In addition, the presence of multiple
schools in the sample allows for the inclusion of grade-by-year fixed effects that account for any

As noted, however, ny potential reactions yielding different classroom assignments within a given school
do not cause problems.

18

16

grade specific, statewide changes in policy, curriculum, or the difficulty of tests. Therefore the
racial composition and teacher characteristic effects are identified by deviations from school
averages for each grade and year.
In this framework, the remaining variation in racial composition and the other variables
comes both from students switching schools and from persistent cohort-to-cohort differences
reflecting natural demographic variations in cohort composition within schools. But, because either
of these sources of variation may be systematically related to student and family determinants of
achievement, we must account for student heterogeneity directly as well as the direct effects of
mobility.
Mobility induced changes, although frequently ignored in research based on cohort
comparisons, introduce potentially serious problems.19 Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2004) show
that blacks are much more likely to change schools than whites and thus to contribute
disproportionately to year-to-year changes in school racial composition. Moreover, the evidence
shows that movers tend to have lower prior achievement. In order to purge these contaminating
influences, we control directly for the effects of moving on school changers with a vector of
mobility variables that allow for different effects by timing, number, and type of move.20
The key remaining issue is the appropriate method for controlling for student-specific
heterogeneity, αiGY in Equation (1). Many prior authors have emphasized the role of fixed ability
differences, but concerns go considerably beyond this notion of heterogeneity. Equation (2)

19

An identifying assumption in a number of studies that make use of cohort differences is that either raw
cohort differences or differences remaining following the removal of school specific trends over time are not
correlated with confounding factors. This approach, which builds on the intuition that students close in age in
the same school have many similar experiences, has been used in a variety of circumstances (e.g., Ehrenberg
and Brewer (1995), Ferguson and Ladd (1996), and more recently generalized by Hoxby (2000)).

Indicator variables differentiate both among those moving during the summer, school year, or at least twice
in the same year and among within district changes, district changes within geographic region, and moves
across regions.

specifies αiGY as a function of prior school, peer, and family variables in previous grades, and
unobserved “ability” γ, a function of early childhood experiences, prenatal care, and heredity.21

This formulation captures the cumulative effects of families, communities, and schools

that establish the knowledge base at the start of grade G and therefore affect achievement at the end
of grade G.22 The effects of prior period variables are assumed to decline exponentially as a
function of time from the present at a constant rate (1-θ), where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1 . At the extreme of θ =0,
past inputs are not relevant for current achievement, i.e., having a good fourth grade teacher does
not have any implications for math achievement at the end of the fifth grade. (Note that θ =0
corresponds to estimating models of the level of achievement along with an individual student
fixed effect). On the other hand, θ =1 implies no depreciation of the influence of past inputs, i.e.,
that the impact of a good fourth grade teacher on fourth grade achievement equals her impact on
fifth grade achievement and achievement in all future grades. (θ =1 corresponds to estimating
models specified in terms of ΔA , or the simple change in achievement across grades).
Equation (2) includes a mixture of time invariant and time varying differences that could
potentially bias estimates of racial composition effects if not incorporated directly into the
estimation. But, as can be readily seen by writing equations 1 and 2 for grade G-1, including the
student’s prior test score on the right hand side of equation 1 captures the cumulative effects of
prior school, community, and family influences that might be systematically related to peer and
21

Boardman and Murnane (1979) and Todd and Wolpin (2003) also highlight the importance of unobserved
ability and the cumulative nature of learning.
22
This representation makes clear the interpretation of the various inputs (X, S, and P) in equation 1. These
represent the flow of these inputs in each grade, while the cumulative inputs in equation 2, appropriately
weighted, provide the stock of each input prior to grade G. At times the flows are measured by the level of
specific inputs that do not change frequently, such as the educational attainment of parents, but the
conceptual idea is that parents with different educational attainment provide differing flows of inputs to their

18

teacher variables without imposing an assumption about the value of θ. The coefficient on prior
achievement is thus a direct estimate of θ.
Notice that our formulation is learning-based in that the value of γ affects the quantity of
skills and knowledge acquired at each grade, and these increments to achievement are subject to
depreciation. This explicitly permits the affects of ability on achievement to increase with age. The
exact formulation and interpretation depends, however, on the measurement of achievement. If
measured with vertically integrated tests, differences in γ would contribute to a widening of the
skill distribution over time as long as θ were not equal to zero.23 On the other hand, if skills were
measured by location in the distribution (as we do here with standardized scores), the complicated
final term in parentheses could be replaced with γi, because ability induced differences in relative
achievement would remain constant over time.24
The formulation with lagged achievement does not account explicitly for the
contemporaneous effect of unobserved ability, and a key identifying assumption is that any
variation in γ not correlated with the prior test score is orthogonal to the variation in the teacher and
school characteristics that remains following the inclusion of the multiple levels of school fixed
effects. We do not believe that this is a strong condition. To be violated, it must be the case that –
conditional on prior score – schools or parents take actions to alter average teacher or peer
characteristics for a specific grade in ways that are related systematically to unobserved ability.
In sum, the approach is aimed at eliminating in a very general way any systematic family,
school, and neighborhood factors that might be correlated with the focal determinants of

child’s learning. Moreover, with separation and new family relationships, these inputs can themselves vary
over time.
23
In testing terms this implies having vertically scaled scores that indicate skills and knowledge over time
and not just measurement relative to a grade-specific norm for learning.
24
Note that, more generally, this holds for all time invariant factors. Consequently, if the distributions of
school quality and family and community environments were fixed through grade G, current characteristics
would fully describe schooling, family, and community histories. Of course this would rule out the use of
panel estimators and make it virtually impossible to identify the causal effects of specific factors. Moreover,
the notion of constant school and teacher quality contradicts evidence of substantial student mobility and
within-school variation over time in the quality of education.

19

achievement, i.e., with teacher quality and racial composition. The remaining exogenous variation
through natural demographic differences among cohorts and inter-temporal movements in school
circumstances thus allows for identification of how specific teacher and peer characteristics
influence racial achievement gaps.
B. Results
The analysis focuses on the effects of racial composition and initial teacher experience;
class size is also included in all specifications though the small differences by race rules out a
sizeable role for class size in explaining growth in the achievement gap. We also considered other
factors including teacher education, average teacher experience, and proportion of students who are
Hispanic.25 Consistent with prior work, however, no teacher education variable or measures of
experience beyond the initial years were significant determinants of achievement, and their
exclusion from the analysis had virtually no effect on the other coefficients. A similar result was
found for the proportions of students who are Hispanic and Asian. Finally, the effects of all
variables are allowed to differ by race and achievement quartile.
Table 6 reports estimates by race and initial achievement quartile and robust standard
errors clustered by school for three specifications that progressively add school-by-year and
school-by-grade fixed effects estimated separately for elementary and middle school grades.26 In
addition to the reported estimates, all specifications include indicators for subsidized lunch
eligibility, participation in special education, female, a family initiated move, and a transition to
Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) finds that teacher experience is important in the first two years of a
teaching career (but not thereafter) and that class size has small effects in earlier grades. These patterns are
consistent with a number of other high-quality recent works including Rockoff (2004), Boyd et al. (2006),
and Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger (2006). Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2006) find increased concentration of
black students has a particularly deleterious effect on black achievement. This finding is consistent with
Guryan (2004), Angrist and Lang (2004), and Hanushek and Raymond (2005).
26
In order to reduce computation time substantially we aggregate the data by race, initial achievement
quartile, school, grade, and year and weight the regressions by the number of students in each cell. Given that
the models are linear, it is not surprising that preliminary estimates of the weighted aggregate and student
level models were quite similar in magnitude and significance. Estimates are based on a total of 445,741
observations in the elementary school regressions and 552,382 observations in the middle school regressions.
Only black and white nonHispanic students who remain with their cohort and have nonmissing test scores for

a. Robust standard errors clustered by school in parenthesis. All specifications include a black and female indicators, indicators for a transition to junior high,
subsidized lunch eligibility, special education participation, and a non-structural move (all fully interacted with black), and a full set of grade-by-year variables.

middle school (in the middle school regressions), the share of students who are new to the school,
and the share of teachers with two years of experience, all fully interacted by initial achievement
quartile and race.
The results reported in the first panel of Table 6 reveal substantial differences in the effects
of proportion black by initial achievement quartile, race, and schooling level. Consider first the two
lower achievement quartiles. Estimated effects of school proportion black on blacks and whites are
quite similar in both elementary and middle school. In the elementary school regressions, the
hypothesis that racial composition has no effect on elementary school achievement cannot be
rejected at conventional levels for either blacks or whites. In the middle school regressions, by
comparison, the effects are larger and more precisely estimated; they remain quite similar in
magnitude for blacks and whites, significant at the five percent level in the specification with
school-by-grade fixed effects and only slightly smaller and almost significant at the five percent
level in the model that also includes school-by-year fixed effects. The fact that the addition of
school-by-year fixed effects causes slight reductions in coefficient magnitudes and slight increases
in standard error magnitudes is consistent with possibility that the additional fixed effects
exacerbate any measurement error induced attenuation bias.
In contrast, there are substantial differences across race in the estimates for students in the
two higher quartiles, particularly those with the highest initial scores. The full fixed effect
estimates of proportion black on achievement for blacks in the top initial achievement quartile are
-0.20 (significant at the 5 percent level) in elementary school and -0.35 (significant at the one
percent level) in middle school. The estimated effects for whites in the highest initial quartile,
however, are small and statistically insignificant in all specifications with campus-by-grade fixed
effects.
The pattern of proportion black estimates suggests peer influences that are largest for high

grades three through eight are included in the sample. A small number of observations are excluded because
of missing information on teachers.

achieving blacks. Not only does the stability of the estimates across specifications support the
notion that the estimates identify a causal effect, but it also suggests that the underlying mechanism
relates to peers and not to school factors such as curriculum or school quality. Given that only
grade specific variation over time is used to identify the estimates, it is unlikely that grade specific
school or teacher quality that is correlated with proportion black in a particular grade and year is
driving the estimates. The finding of larger effects in middle school and for initially high achieving
blacks is also consistent with the beliefs that peer influences grow as students enter adolescence
and that high achieving blacks come under pressure not to achieve, though the precise causal
mechanism cannot be understood in the absence of more detailed information on peer interactions.
The next two panels show a strong negative relationship between achievement and the
share of teachers with little or no experience. All coefficients for the share with no prior experience
reported in the top panel are negative; many are significant at the five percent level for blacks, and
all are significant at the five percent level for whites. For whites, a similar pattern to that observed
for the peer proportion black estimates appears, as the coefficient magnitudes decline in both
elementary and middle school as initial achievement rises, though in this case estimated effects
tend to be larger in the younger grades. No such clear ordering appears for blacks, though the lack
of precision in the estimates may conceal a true underlying pattern.
The impact of teachers with only one year of prior experience (panel 3) tends to be smaller
and less precisely estimated. Regardless of initial achievement, all of the coefficients for whites in
the elementary school regressions are much smaller in magnitude, and none are significant at the
five percent level. For whites in the middle school, estimated effects of teachers with one year
experience are quite similar to the corresponding coefficients for those with zero years of
experience, with the exception of students in the bottom initial achievement category for whom the
estimate is quite small and imprecise. The impact for black students in middle school tends to be
similar to that of teachers with zero years of experience, but these effects are quite imprecisely
estimated for elementary school.

22

Implications of School Effects
The combination of disparate circumstances in black and white schools and of strong and
racially divergent impacts of the included school and peer variables suggests that schools account
for at least a portion of the growth in the racial achievement gap. Blacks typically attend schools
with a much higher black enrollment share and, as often discussed, attend schools with a larger
portion of rookie teachers. To understand the impact of these on achievement, we use the estimates
from the full fixed effect model reported in Table 6 to simulate the impact of setting the racial
composition and teacher distribution faced by black students to the average in all of Texas schools.
These simulations assume a rate of knowledge depreciation of 0.3, roughly equal to one minus the
coefficient on lagged achievement score for blacks.
Table 7 shows the simulated impact on the achievement of blacks from reducing the
proportion of schoolmates who are black, the proportion of teachers with no prior experience, and
the proportion of teachers with one year of experience from their actual levels to the average for
whites and blacks combined in the state of Texas. Other than for the lowest initial achievement
group that experienced a very small increase in the gap, the simulations suggest that race
differences in school proportion black and teacher experience explain between 25 and 50 percent of
the growth in the achievement gap between grades four and eight. School proportion black has a
much larger impact than does teacher experience for all groups, though it is important to recognize
that unmeasured differences in teacher quality may be important as well.
Indeed, the impact of schools is almost certainly much larger than we show here: As Rivkin,
Hanushek, and Kain (2005) indicate, easily quantifiable variables do not explain the bulk of the
variance in teacher and school quality. Our analytical strategy focuses entirely on identifying
causal impacts of a small number of variables, and thus a portion of the systematic influences of
schools and peers were undoubtedly ignored because of impediments to the measurement and

identification of variable effects.27
Our estimation approach relies entirely on within-school variation (across grades and
years) in the teacher and peer variables. We then combined these estimates with between-school
differences in the specific factors to simulate their contributions to the achievement differential. As
noted earlier, we believe that other differences in teachers and schools also tend to favor whites
over blacks and widen the achievement gap. One hint at the potential magnitude comes from
decomposing the growth in the achievement gap into between-school and within-school
components. Although the sharp divergence in school attendance patterns and accompanying
uncertainty about the appropriate method for weighting observations introduces some uncertainty,
several different decomposition algorithms suggest that roughly two-thirds of the growth in the gap
occurred between schools for all four groups. Of course family and community differences across
schools also contribute to the between-school component, so this estimate should not be interpreted
as the contribution of schools per se. 28

The Policy Dilemma
By any measure, black-white differences in schooling outcomes are a matter of enormous
concern. The early progress toward racial convergence that followed Brown v. Board of Education
and the civil rights legislation of the 1960s has slowed if not stopped over the past two decades
(Neal (2006)). The implications of this slowdown for earnings inequality and the economic
well-being of blacks have been magnified by the substantial increase in the return to skill
experienced over the past 30 years. The differences in measured skills between blacks and whites
are enormous. By age 17, the average black student is performing at around the 20th percentile of

One example is the possible importance of the race match of students and teachers. Ehrenberg and
Brewer (1995), Dee (2004), and Hanushek, Kain, O'Brien, and Rivkin (2005) find that black students do
better when matched with a black teacher. However, because we cannot investigate classroom linkages here,
we cannot pursue this element of schools.
28
In earlier grades, Fryer and Levitt (2006) estimate a smaller between-school share.
27

the white distribution.29 This performance feeds directly into further schooling and into the labor
market, contributing to substantial black-white differences in lifetime earnings and occupational
prestige.
A central component of public policy to address this situation is to use schooling
investments to increase the skills of minorities and disadvantaged populations and thus to
ameliorate the disparate economic outcomes. To this end, two aspects of the current situation –
vividly depicted in Figure 1 – are particularly telling. First, the black-white achievement gap
appears to increase, not decrease, with schooling. Second, the observed gap grows most for blacks
who start out at higher achievement levels.
Nonetheless, implications for policy remain uncertain. At first blush, effective policy
initiatives would seem straightforward. Blacks suffer from a concentration of new teachers and
from the racial concentrations in the schools they attend. Further, because black students are
differentially affected by these, particularly in the case of racial composition, there appears to be
room for Pareto improving policies – since according to the estimates black students can be helped
at little or no cost to white students. However, Supreme Court decisions, housing patterns, and
evidence regarding teacher labor markets suggest limited policy options with regard to altering
student racial composition and potentially high costs to altering the distribution of inexperienced
teachers.
Perhaps the most easily identified policies revolve around ensuring that black students do
not draw a disproportionate share of beginning teachers. However, because a substantial portion of
the existing teacher experience differential appears to result from the teacher preferences related to
working conditions including location and because teachers cannot be required to teach in
particular districts, urban districts may have a very difficult time raising salaries high to attract
experienced teachers to high poverty, high proportion black schools. (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin

See data on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP (National Center for Education
Statistics (2005)).

(2004) and Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff (2005)). Any changes in the process through
which districts allocate teachers to schools that disadvantage experienced teachers is likely to
induce exit from the district unless salaries are increased, perhaps substantially.30
Reducing the impact of peer composition is even more problematic. The recent U.S.
Supreme Court decisions concerning schools in Seattle and Louisville severely limited if not
curtailed the use of race-based policies in public schools.31 But, more important, as Rivkin and
Welch (2006) report, housing patterns account for the bulk of school segregation, and prior court
decisions limit inter-district desegregation programs.32 Moreover, our sample covers a period
without much systematic desegregation activity, and the relationship between achievement and
racial composition might depend upon both programmatic and historical factors that determine
school attendance patterns in a given district. Consequently, active initiatives designed to increase
substantially black exposure to whites might produce a different relationship between achievement
and racial composition that we identify here.
The implication is that, while we identify specific school and peer factors that
systematically affect racial achievement gaps, policy directed at just these factors is unlikely to be
very successful. Instead, looking at a more comprehensive set of policies aimed at improving the
quality of schools attended by blacks – such as improving teacher quality in those schools perhaps
by a combination of an expansion in the pool of potential teachers through deregulation, salary
increases and improvements in working conditions– will be required. Nonetheless, the magnitude
of the achievement gaps is truly large, and the large gaps at entry to school point to the further need
for a broader set of policies.
Finally, it is crucial to recognize that test score differences do not provide adequate
information for those not in the test sample, which in this case includes students retained in grade or
Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (2004) estimate that just equalizing the teacher outflow between central city
and suburban schools in Texas would require increasing the average salary of younger teachers by over 40
percent.

those excused from test taking because of a disability or other circumstance.33 Given the much
higher rate of special education classification and grade retention for blacks than for whites and for
black boys in particular, the achievement comparisons do not capture fully the gap in education
progress and do not illustrate the educational difficulties of many at the lower end of the
achievement distribution including those that will likely experience poor academic, social, and
labor market outcomes in the future.34

See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70 (1995).
See Appendix Table A1 for the quantitative magnitudes of exclusions.
34
The low rates of test taking for blacks and to a lesser extent whites among those who participate in all five
waves in the ECLS sample raise the possibility that the reported growth in achievement differences
understates the actual increase during the early elementary school years.
