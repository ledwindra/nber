    "abstract": "\n\nWith count-valued outcomes y in {0,1,...,M} identification and estimation of average treatment effects raise no special considerations beyond those involved in the continuous-outcome case. If partial identification of the distribution of treatment effects is of interest, however, count-valued outcomes present some subtle yet important considerations beyond those involved in continuous-outcome contexts. This paper derives appropriate bounds on the distribution of treatment effects for count-valued outcomes.\n\n",
