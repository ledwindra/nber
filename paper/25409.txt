ABSTRACT
This paper argues that the key deep underlying fundamental for the growing international
imbalances leading to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system between 1971 and 1973 was
rising U.S. inflation since 1965. It was driven in turn by expansionary fiscal and monetary
policies—the elephant in the room. What was kept in the background at the Camp David meeting
on August 15 1971 when President Richard Nixon closed the U.S. gold window, as well as
imposing a ten per cent surcharge on all imports and a ninety day wage price freeze—was that
U.S. inflation, driven by macro policies, was the main problem facing the Bretton Woods System,
and that for political and doctrinal reasons was not directly addressed. Instead President Nixon
blamed the rest of the world rather than focusing on issues with U.S. monetary and fiscal
policies. In addition, at the urging of Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur F. Burns, Nixon adopted
wage and price controls to mask the inflation, hence punting the problem into the future.
This paper revisits the story of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the origins of the
Great Inflation. Based on historical narratives and conversations with the Honorable George P.
Shultz, a crucial player in the events of the period 1969 to 1973, I argue the case that the pursuit
of tighter monetary and fiscal policies could have avoided much of the turmoil in the waning
years of Bretton Woods. Moreover, I point out some of the similarities between the imbalances of
the 1960s and 1970s—especially fiscal and the use of tariff protection as a strategic tool, as well
as some differences—relatively stable monetary policy and floating exchange rates.

The Imbalances of the Bretton Woods System 1965 to 1973: U.S. Inflation, The
Elephant in the Room
1.Introduction
The Nixon shock of August 15 1971 was a critical event in the twentieth century
history of the international monetary system. It was on a par with the ending of the
classical gold standard at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 and the UK’s
departure from the gold exchange standard in September 1931.
President Richard Nixon’s speech to the nation on that Sunday ended the history of
gold convertibility that underlay the Bretton Woods System and that was a major
underpinning of the global monetary system for two centuries. The rest of the
Bretton Woods System (the adjustable peg) collapsed with the advent of generalized
(managed) floating exchange rates in March 1973.

One of the driving motivations for President Nixon’s actions was the perception that
growing imbalances between the U.S., with an exploding balance of payments deficit,
and Germany and other countries of Western Europe and Japan, with burgeoning
surpluses, was harmful to the competitive position of U.S. manufacturing and the
country’s overall prosperity. President Nixon’s New Economic Policy had three
principal prongs: closing the gold window to protect the remaining U.S. gold reserves;
a ten per cent surcharge on imports of all countries to force the surplus countries to
revalue their currencies; and a ninety-day wage price freeze to control U.S. inflation.

This paper argues that the key deep underlying fundamental for the growing
international imbalances was rising U.S. inflation since 1965, in turn driven by
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies—the elephant in the room. What was kept
in the background in August 15 1971 was that U.S. inflation, driven by U.S. macro
policies, was the main problem facing the Bretton Woods System, and that for political
and doctrinal reasons was not directly addressed. Instead President Nixon blamed
the rest of the world instead of correcting U.S. monetary and fiscal policies. In
addition, at the urging of Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur F. Burns, Nixon adopted
wage and price controls to mask the inflation, hence punting the problem into the
future.

This paper revisits the story of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the
origins of the Great Inflation. Based on narratives as well as conversations with the
Honorable George P. Shultz, a crucial player in the events of the period 1969 to 1973,
I argue the case that the pursuit of tighter monetary and fiscal policies could have
avoided most of the turmoil in the waning years of Bretton Woods. Moreover, I point
out some similarities between the imbalances of the 1960s and 1970s –-especially
fiscal and the use of tariff protection as a strategic tool, as well as some differences –
relatively stable monetary policy and floating exchange rates.

Section 2 provides the background of the Bretton Woods System, established in 1944
but its operational form only ran from 1959 to 1973, after the Western European

4

countries declared current account convertibility. The monetary and fiscal policies of
the U.S. as center country of the BWS were crucial to its successful operation and
survival and we document the connection between US domestic policies, and the
eventual collapse of the BWS between 1968 and 1973.
Section 3 tells the story of the genesis of the Great Inflation which began in 1965 and
ended in 1983. The early years of the Great Inflation are closely tied to the dynamic
forces that eventually destroyed Bretton Woods.
Section 4 focuses on the international policy coordination between the US and the
other major players in the Bretton Woods system (the G10, the IMF, the BIS) to try to
preserve the system. In section 5 we spotlight the actions of three key actors in the
US drama of the collapse of BWS whose actions were an important element in the way
the political economy of the events played out; Arthur Burns, Paul Volcker and George
P. Shultz. Section 6 in conclusion considers some parallels between the events of the
crisis of the early 1970s and the current U.S. situation. Unlike the 1960s and 70s
monetary policy and inflation is not a serious force pointing to a crisis. But there is
some similarity to the 1960s and 1970s in the burgeoning fiscal deficits and a run up
in the ratio of debt to GDP consequent upon the resolution of the Great Financial crisis
and the recent tax cuts. This may lead to a fiscal crisis and eventually a dollar crisis
which has some echoes to the events of 1968 to 1973.

2.Bretton Woods
The Bretton Woods System (BWS) came out of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.
The adjustable peg system was conceived as a compromise between the fixed
exchange rate gold standard and the floating exchange rates of the 1920s ( Bordo
1993, 2017). Its purpose was to optimize the global trading system and yet allow
domestic demand management to preserve full employment. It required capital
controls and the International Monetary Fund was established to help alleviate short
term current account imbalances.
The BWS only became fully operational in December 1958 after the Western
European countries declared current account convertibility. The system quickly
evolved into a gold dollar standard. The U.S. as center country pegged the dollar into
gold at $35 per ounce and the rest of the world pegged their currencies to the dollar.
The U.S. dollar emerged as a key reserve currency for the rest of the world as a
substitute for scarce gold. 1 The demand for international reserves grew with the
growth of real output and trade and was satisfied by the U.S. running ever larger
balance of payments deficits. As center country the U.S did not have to adjust to its
balance of payments deficits by pursuing tight financial policies2. The dollar was held
as international reserves because of its unique properties as an international unit of
account, medium of exchange and store of value. The crucial requirement for the
system to work was that the US maintain stable monetary and fiscal policies, ie
maintain price stability.
The British pound was also a reserve currency in the BWS, but its role declined
steadily throughout the period. See Schenk (2010)
2 It was the n-1th currency in a system of n currencies. See Mundell (1969)

In 1960 Robert Triffin pointed out the problem of having one country’s currency, the
dollar, as the reserve currency for the world (Bordo and McCauley 2018). He posited
that as the rest of the world grew the demand for dollars as international reserves
would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock leading to the possibility of a
run on Fort Knox. Were the Fed to tighten world depression, like in the 1930s, would
follow. The only solution according to Triffin was to create a substitute for dollars as
international reserve. He preferred Keynes’s (1943) bancor, Eventually the
international community produced SDRs as a form of paper gold. Despres,
Kindleberger and Salant(1966) and McKinnon (1969) argued counter to Triffin , that
the US was the banker to the rest of the world and a dollar standard could persist as
long as the U.S. followed stable macro policies.
Milton Friedman (1953) predicted that the adjustable peg would eventually break
down because it depended on capital controls and because the adjustment
mechanism both between countries and the rest of the world and the US wouldn’t
work in the face of downward nominal rigidities and the full employment mandate
that came out of the Employment Act of 1945. As it unfolded Friedman’s predictions
came true. He favored: freely floating exchange rates , rules based monetary and fiscal
policy and no controls on current account and capital account transactions. All of
these were adopted in the 1970s and 1980s.
US and international officials were convinced by the Triffin story especially after the
London price of gold spiked at $40 per ounce on the news that John F Kennedy would
win the 1960 election and follow an inflationary set of policies. They became obsessed
over growing US balance of payments deficits and declining gold reserves as

European real incomes recovered from the devastation of World War II increasing
the demand for dollars. See figure 1 which shows that by 1959 the U.S. monetary gold
stock equaled total external dollar liabilities and the rest of the world’s gold stock
exceeded that of the U.S.

Figure 1: Monetary gold and dollar holdings, the US and the rest of the world, 19451971. Source: Bordo (1993).

By 1966, official dollar liabilities held by foreign monetary authorities exceeded the
US monetary gold stock. dollar holdings. This led to the creation of many official
facilities to staunch the gold drain (Coombs 1976, Solomon 1982, Bordo 1993). These

8

included US capital controls (The Interest Equalization Tax 1963); Operation Twist
1962 ( combining tight monetary policy with expansionary fiscal policy to both
encourage capital inflows and stimulate domestic investment), the Gold Pool in 1961(
in which 8 key countries pooled their gold resources to intervene in the London gold
market and protect the $35 peg Bordo, Monnet, Naif 2017,) moral suasion
(threatening Germany that it would remove U.S. troops if it converted its outstanding
dollars into gold), the GAB( General Arrangements to Borrow 1961 which increased
the IMF’s line of credit to the US in the face of a speculative attack); and the swap
lines( IOUs between central banks as substitutes for gold conversions ( Bordo,
Humpage and Schwartz 2015).
In general these stop gaps measures worked, at least until 1965. More important as
we expand on below, before 1965 Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney
Martin followed a policy of low inflation and the FOMC did pay attention to the US
balance of payments and gold reserves in its deliberations (Bordo and Eichengreen
2013). Europeans complained about US inflation but they were wrong –U.S. inflation
adjusted for output growth was below theirs before 1965 (Meltzer 2010). The French
also resented the exorbitant privilege of the dollar and its “adjustment without tears”
(Bordo, Monnet and Naif 2017).

1965 to 1971: Crisis and Collapse
The key driving force for the growing imbalances beginning in 1965 was money
financed fiscal policy in the U.S. to pay for the Vietnam War and Lyndon Baines

9

Johnson’s Great Society. The increases in fiscal deficits and money growth (relative to
real output growth) led to the beginning of the Great Inflation. See figures 2 and 3.

the G7 excluding the US, 1951-1973. Source: Bordo (1993).

Figure 3: The US budget deficit and the changes in the monetary base, 1955-1973 (yo-y change of quarterly data). Source: Bordo(1993).
The increase in US money growth led to larger US balance of payments deficits (figure
4) and increases in the international reserves of Germany, Japan and other surplus
countries (figure 5), in turn putting pressure on them to expand their money supplies
and push up prices (Bordo 1993) , This led to increased resentment against the U.S.

11

Figure 4: Balance of Payments, US, 1950-1971. Source: Bordo (1993).

In this period the dollar was increasingly under threat seen in a series of currency
crises and unsuccessful policy responses. The first serious threat to the dollar was the
sterling crisis of November 1967 which led to great pressure on the price of gold in
the London Gold market and stressed the Gold Pool. Much of the resources used to
shore up sterling, (the second reserve currency of the BWS believed by the US
monetary authorities as the first line of defense for the dollar Bordo, Monnet, Naef
2017) came from the US Treasury gold window which reduced the monetary gold
stock.

12

Figure 5: Balance of Payments, Germany, 1950-1971. Source: Bordo (1993).

Once sterling was devalued and the pound ceased to be a major reserve asset,
speculation turned against the dollar. The Gold Pool kept raising the quotas required
of the members until first France dropped out in June 1967 and then the others
objected. By March 1968 the US and the other partners in the Pool agreed to close it
and create a two-tier gold market—the private market in London and an official
arrangement open only to monetary authorities. Meltzer (2010) declared this event
as the beginning of the end of the Bretton Woods System.
Two other US actions greatly weakened the US defenses—eliminating the gold
reserve ratio behind member bank reserves in 1965 and then eliminating the gold
reserve ratio behind Federal Reserve notes in 1968. Both of these measures designed
to release more gold resources to defend the dollar ultimately made things worse by
reducing the US’s credibility.

13

The crisis abated somewhat in 1969 following a tightening in both fiscal (the 1968
tax surcharge) and in monetary policy. These policies temporarily led to capital flows
into the US and less pressure on US gold reserves. However the tight policy was
quickly reversed because the Nixon administration feared that the continuation of the
1970 recession into 1971 would threaten the following year’s election and it put
pressure on Burns and the FOMC to loosen its monetary policy (Meltzer 2010, Stein
1994, Wells 1994). This prompted the attack on the dollar to resume leading to a
capital outflow of $4 billion in May 1971 (Meltzer 2010 page 749).
The reaction to the growing balance of payments crisis by the Nixon Administration
was to increasingly blame the surplus countries for running large surpluses and
deliberately undervaluing their currencies to gain a competitive advantage over the
US. There was deep reluctance to recognize that the key source of the problem was
US inflation. 3 To do so would require following monetary contraction and hence
producing a severe recession. Nixon feared such an outcome would harm his
reelection chances in 1972. As we discuss below Fed Chairman Arthur Burns
accommodated the President’s demands.
The crisis peaked in August 1971 when fears that the British would convert their
dollar holdings into gold led President Nixon to announce his New Economic Policy
on August 15. The policy had three principle components: closing the gold window, a
10% surcharge on imports, and a 90 day wage price freeze. The object of the first two
This is not to argue that the only cause of the global imbalances of the 1960s and
70s was US inflation. The surplus countries did follow export led growth policies
and were reluctant to revalue their currencies. However rising US inflation became
increasingly the major problem leading to the collapse of Bretton Woods ( Bordo
1993).

actions was to preserve US gold reserves and to pressure the surplus countries to
revalue their currencies. The wage price freeze (which later turned into controls)
reflected the belief by Burns and others that inflation was primarily driven by non
monetary cost push forces and more fundamentally that the domestic political costs
of the correct monetary policy required to really kill inflation was just too high.

3. The Beginning of the Great Inflation in the U.S.
During World War II the US financed only a small part of wartime expenditures with
the inflation tax compared to World War I and much of it was suppressed by price
controls (Friedman and Schwartz 1963 ). During the War the Federal Reserve was
subservient to the Treasury and was constrained in its actions by enforcing pegs on
both short term and long term government securities. After the war when the
controls were lifted inflation jumped, reaching a peak in 1948. The Fed began
pressing for a return to its operational independence which was finally achieved in
the Federal Reserve Treasury Accord of February 1951. In the following decade under
the direction of Chairman William McChesney Martin the Fed followed a policy geared
to price stability. This was consistent with the conservative fiscal policies of the
Eisenhower Administration (Meltzer 2010, Stein 1994). Martin also paid
considerable attention to the gold constraint of the Bretton Woods system and the
balance of payments and monetary gold reserves.
The succeeding Kennedy and Johnson administrations attached high priority to
increasing US growth and reducing unemployment using Keynesian aggregate

15

demand management policies. The 1964 Kennedy tax cut increased the fiscal deficit
and in this period the Martin Fed began accommodating fiscal policy by its even keel
operations (Meltzer 2010)4.

Martin attached considerable importance to cooperating with the administration and
his concept of central bank independence was “independent within the government”.
As a consequence money growth began increasing along with fiscal deficits.

The underlying ideology of macroeconomic policy changed in this period from
classical orthodoxy to Keynesianism. Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Walter
Heller and then Arthur Okun adopted the Phillips Curve as their policy guide.
Following the mandate of the Employment act of 1945 their main emphasis was on
maximizing employment. Reducing unemployment below 4 % was the goal at the
expense of higher inflation. The welfare costs of inflation were perceived as lower
than the costs of unemployment. The Keynesians also believed that fiscal policy was
a more potent tool of demand management than monetary policy and that both
monetary and fiscal policies should be used to fine tune the business cycle ( Stein
1994).

17

Inflation increased slowly after 1962 and then more rapidly in 1965 with the build up
in government expenditures for the Vietnam War and LBJ’s Great Society programs
(figure 8). Meltzer (2010 page 485) posited that the Fed’s expansionary monetary
policy accommodated one half of the increase in the fiscal deficit. As inflation
increased the Martin Fed began following a tighter monetary policy in late 1965.
President Johnson greatly opposed this for fear that his domestic agenda would be
sabotaged and he put considerable pressure on Martin to avoid tight money5. The
Congress also favored low interest rates in this period.

The urban legend is that LBJ invited Martin down to his ranch and took him for a
rough drive in a jeep when he made the point that Martin should not raise the
discount rate in December (which he did anyway) Bordo and Eichengreen 2013,

In 1966-67 Fed tightening (in part due to concerns over the balance of payments) led
to the Credit Crunch of 1966 when rising rates surpassed the regulation Q ceiling on
time deposits and led to a decline in mortgage finance. This led to considerable
pressure from Congress and the Administration to shift to a more expansionary policy
(which it did). In the years 1965 to 1969 (with a few exceptions) the FOMC reduced
its attention to the rest of the world, to the US balance of payments and to the
monetary gold stock in favor of its domestic objectives (Bordo and Eichengreen
2013).
Meltzer (2010 chapter 4) summarized Fed policy in the early years of the Great
Inflation as increasingly attaching more weight to unemployment than inflation. This
reflected both ideology—the adoption of Keynesian doctrine; and politics—increased
pressure from the administration to avoid rising unemployment. As a consequence,
expansionary monetary (and fiscal policy) would lead to a reduction in
unemployment then followed by an increase in inflation. The Fed would then tighten
to reduce inflation but once unemployment started increasing political pressure
would encourage the Fed to abandon its tightening. According to Meltzer these
actions convinced the public that the Fed did not attach high priority to inflation
which became more and more persistent as inflationary expectations became
embedded in the public conscience6.
Richard Nixon became President in November 1968 and he campaigned on a platform
to roll back the expansionary aggregate demand policies and the liberal agenda of the
preceding Democratic administrations. He was influenced by the views of Milton

Friedman. He posited a greater role for free markets, the pursuit of a policy of
monetary gradualism to reduce inflation, and full employment balanced budgets. In
October 1969 he appointed Arthur Burns as Chairman of the Fed. Burns was close to
Milton Friedman (his teacher at Rutgers University in the 1930s). Burns was viewed
as an advocate of sound money but not of monetary rules (Meltzer 2010, Wells 1994).
He also had been a close advisor to Nixon since 1960.
Before leaving, Martin began pursuing a tight monetary policy. This was also
coincident with the 1968 tax surcharge (passed in early 1969). This led to the
beginning of a recession in late 1969 which did reduce inflation close to 3 % from a
peak of 6%. Burns followed through with the inherited policy and the Nixon
administration did not roll back the Johnson tax surcharge. This contributed to a
recession in 1970 and rising unemployment.
Burns under pressure from Nixon reversed policies and began expanding money
growth in early 1971. Burns both remembered that he had correctly warned Nixon in
1960 that a recession was coming which would threaten his election chances and had
acceded to Nixon’s promise on the day he was installed as Chairman “You see to it: no
recession” (Wells 1994 page 42).7
Monetary expansion rekindled inflation in 1971. Burns was increasingly reluctant to
tighten monetary policy. In 1970 he began to publically state that the key determinant
of inflation was now cost push pressure by big labor unions and large firms with
considerable market power. During that year in varying venues he began advocating
Nixon also said about Burns, “ I respect his independence . However, I hope that
independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed”
(Wells 1994 page 42)

incomes policies—wage and price controls8. As mentioned above the big upsurge in
US inflation spilled over into the balance of payments deficit, the international
reserves of the surplus countries and inflationary pressure abroad. This precipitated
the balance of payments crisis in the summer of 1971 and led to Nixon’s Camp David
speech on August 15.
A key component of the New Economic Policy was a 90 day wage price freeze. Arthur
Burns was successful in overcoming the opposition of Milton Friedman and George
Shultz and convincing first Secretary of the Treasury John Connally and then
President Nixon that incomes policy would deal with the inflation problem. This
decision in turn reflected both Burns and the Nixon administration’s unwillingness to
recognize the elephant in the room and use monetary policy to reduce inflation
directly. This reflected Nixon’s fear of a recession weakening his re- election chances
in the forthcoming 1972 Presidential election and Burns’s surrendering the Federal
Reserve’s independence to political pressure.

4. International Policy Considerations
The Bretton Woods system was designed as a cooperative exercise and the IMF was
established to coordinate international and domestic macro policies of all the
members. As described in Bordo and Schenk (2017) as the BWS evolved increasing
policy coordination was required to manage the ongoing currency crises facing many
countries (eg France 1958,Italy 1961, Canada 1962) . Of greater importance to the

See Shultz (2018) who unearthed a letter from Burns to Nixon dated June 22 1971
when he explicitly advocated wage price controls.

BWS was the chronic sterling crisis which played out intermittently from 1947 to
1968 (Bordo, McDonald and Oliver 2009). The final episode was the crisis of the
dollar from 1968 to 1973.
In addition to the IMF which was an organization of finance ministers, the G10
advanced countries plus Switzerland and the BIS an organization of central bankers
emerged as the key players in the major rescues of the 1960s (Bordo and Schenk
2017).
As mentioned above, in response to the Triffin dilemma the U.S. authorities and the
other international agencies set up many facilities to preserve US gold reserves.
All of these mechanisms came under great strain once the U.S. began inflating and its
balance of payments deficits expanded.
Richard Nixon changed the international perspective of the US away from providing
a favorable institutional and political environment for the development of the
international economy embodied in the New Deal Bretton Woods institutions. He
turned inward and made domestic US concerns “national renewal” his prime focus
(Sargent 2015 page 102). He attributed the global imbalances threatening U.S. gold
reserves and the position of the dollar on the surplus countries of Western Europe
and Japan who he believed intentionally undervalued their currencies to gain a
competitive advantage over the US. They also pursued an export driven growth
model. This perception dominated the deliberations leading to the Camp David
announcement.
Nixon, Connally and his other advisors viewed cutting the link with gold as a measure
to force the others to adjust by revaluing their currencies. The temporary import

22

surcharge was also viewed as a strategic measure to force the others to come to the
bargaining table. It was believed that once the rest of the world revalued their
currencies US investment and manufacturing industry would regain the position lost
to foreign competition (Irwin 2013).9
After the Camp David announcement Nixon sent Connally and Paul Volcker, Under
Secretary of the Treasury, to the capitals of the world to convince them to adjust the
values of their currencies. The chief hold out was President Pompidou of France who
believed that the US should devalue the dollar (raise the dollar price of gold). A
meeting between Nixon and Pompidou in November 1971 led to a compromise at a
meeting of the major countries at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC
December 11 1971.
At the Smithsonian the US agreed to devalue the dollar by 8.5%, the Europeans
revalued their currencies by a similar amount and Japan agreed to revalue the Yen by
16.9%. In addition, the revamped par value system would have wider exchange rate
bands of 2.25 % instead of the original 1% (Volcker and Gyothen 1992).
Through this period US inflation was still going strong and the pressure on
imbalances continued. George P Shultz, newly appointed Secretary of the Treasury,
proposed a plan at the IMF Annual meetings in September 1972(dubbed Plan X) to
correct the imbalances (Shultz 1973). This plan, earlier formed with the aid of Milton
Friedman and Paul Volcker, was an attempt to create a quasi- flexible exchange rate
system and ultimately move to free floating. Under the Plan countries would convert

position on trade issues for political reasons—to get domestic political support.

their reserves into SDRs. Each member would adjust their currencies to imbalances
measured by a series of indicators based on the size of their reserves relative to some
normal measure, which in in turn were based on their IMF quotas (Schenk 2017).
Countries with reserves below normal would have to devalue their currencies by 34% per year. Countries with reserves larger than normal would have to revalue their
currencies by 3% per year, countries whose reserves exceeded 175% of normal
would be penalized and lose access to convertibility. In a sense this was an
actualization of Keynes’s (1943) scarce currency clause which was blocked by the US
at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.Both the IMF and France were opposed to
the plan and it never was adopted.
Throughout 1972 one country after another left the par value system and floated;
Canada May 1970, Germany (May 1971) followed by Austria, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Switzerland, the UK June 1972..The US devalued a second time by
10 % in February 1973. By March 1973 the par value system had disappeared
replaced de facto by generalized managed floating.

5. Key Players in the Drama
Three US officials (other than Richard Nixon and John Connally) were key players in
the drama of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system: Arthur Burns, Paul Volcker
and George P Shultz.
Arthur Burns was the villain of the play because of his about face in 1970 on inflation.
By rejecting the role of monetary forces and advocating wage price controls he had

24

considerable responsibility for the Great Inflation of the 1970s 10 . He also was a
continued advocate for pegged exchange rates and an opponent of floating. Before
1970 he was an advocate for a gradualist approach of slowly and steadily reducing
money growth to reduce inflation without engendering a recession. Once he became
Chairman of the Federal Reserve and under the thumb of Richard Nixon (who was
paranoid about the political consequences of rising unemployment based on his
perception of why he lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy), he became an
advocate for wage price controls (Leeson 2004). The Great Inflation and stagnation
of the 1970s has largely been blamed on the policies he and the FOMC followed until
1978 (Meltzer 2010 chapter 6 and the chapters in Bordo and Orphanides 2013).
Burns also was a continued advocate for pegged exchange rates and an opponent of
floating (Leeson 2004)
Paul Volcker was Under Secretary of the Treasury before and after Camp David. He
headed up several task forces at Treasury on the solution for the imbalances. In 1969
Milton Friedman was very pleased at Burns’s appointment to the Federal Reserve
Chairmanship. He expected that he would follow through with a gradualist rules
based monetary strategy. When Burns changed his views and became an advocate of
wage price controls and an opponent of the monetary approach to inflation
Friedman was very upset and was highly critical of his former mentor for many
years.
In another letter to Robert Leeson on May 11 1994, Friedman wrote
“It is interesting that you present Arthur Burns as the key opponent of inflation
policies at the time (the 1960s), and that is certainly correct. However it is ironic
that in the 1970s, particularly 1971, he bears considerable responsibility for the
adoption of price and wage control, and accordingly for the subsequent inflation
that it unleashed. This was when he was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He
gave a speech in early 1971 essentially defending “voluntary price and wage control,
something which was precisely what was precisely the opposite of what he urged
long before. I say this with sadness since Arthur Burns was unquestionably the
single most important professional mentor I had to whom I was extremely close as a
student, as a colleague, and as a friend.”

10

25

his report emphasized adjustment by the surplus countries. He argued that if the
surplus countries could not be persuaded to revalue within two years that the U.S.
should close the Gold Window until close to the very end he was an advocate for
maintaining the par value system and maintaining convertibility of the dollar into
gold. Following through on his views in 1969, he argued in the spring of 1971, for an
end to convertibility. He in turn persuaded John Connally, the Secretary of the
Treasury and the President Nixon to do this at Camp David. Later he was a key planner
of Plan X and was greatly involved in the negotiations that led by 1973 to the advent
of Managed Floating. His earlier views on the importance of credibility was a theme
that came back a decade later when he ended the Great Inflation. (Silber 2012,).
George P Shultz was the hero of the drama. He had three cabinet positions in the
Nixon administration; Labor, OMB and Treasury. He had been a close colleague of
Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago and brought many of his views to
government. He was in favor of monetary orthodoxy—targeting money growth to
maintain price stability and fiscal balance in the form of a full employment balanced
budget. Like Friedman he believed in a policy of monetary gradualism. This policy,
tried in the early Nixon years, was unsuccessful because it didn’t account for shifts in
velocity and because the Fed had not been not following a consistent credible rule like
policy (Bordo, Erceg, Levin and Michaels 2017). As a labor economist Shultz
understood the importance of large unions and big corporations in the US economy
and was most successful in heading off major strikes. He also was a strong opponent
of wage price guidelines in the 1960s (Aliber and Shultz 1966) and then wage price
controls in the 70s. He tried unsuccessfully to counter Burns campaign for controls at

26

Camp David but his views were later vindicated as the distortions of the controls
program mounted in the next decade. His “Steady as you Go Speech” in June 1971 was
a blueprint for a policy strategy for the Nixon administration which if it had been
followed would likely have avoided much of the economic turmoil of the 1970s.
According to Shultz in private conversation, its main goal was to head off wage price
controls which he feared were coming.
“A captain has the choice of steering his ship by telltale, following the prevailing
winds, or to steer by the compass. In a democracy, you must have your eye on the
telltale, following the prevailing winds, or to steer by the compass.” Shultz 1971 page
15.
Milton Friedman in his Newsweek column on July 26 1971 praised the speech. A year
later in his May 14, 1973 Newsweek column “Steady as You Go Revisited” he argued
that had the administration listened to Shultz’s advice at Camp David, and not
imposed the controls but still had closed the gold window that the US economy would
have been much better off.
“In the price and wage area, “steady as you go” would have avoided the turmoil and
disruption of the freeze, phase one and two… Most important of all, “steady as you go”
would have avoided miseducating the public about the cause and cure of inflation.”11
Shultz also was a strong advocate for floating exchange rates and viewed cutting the
link with gold at Camp David as a first step in moving to a floating rate system. Later
Plan X was devised as a scheme to deliver exchange rate flexibility through the back
door. Subsequently as Secretary of the Treasury he pushed hard to make the US

generalized floating in 1973.12

6. Conclusion: Some Lessons for today

The major policy issue in the US and the rest of the world in the 1960s and 1970s was
inflation. That is not the case today although it could be if the Fed is too slow to
tighten. Rather the key policy issue today is fiscal. Like the 1960s and 70s the issue
was a run up in fiscal deficits beginning in 1965 and continuing through the 1970s. In
recent years major fiscal expansion to stem the Great Recession and a significant run
up in the debt to GDP ratio has not been rolled back. The recent tax cuts have
increased the fiscal imbalance and are raising the debt ratio into historically high
levels. As the Fed tightens to normalize monetary policy, and were inflation to pick
up much beyond the 2% level, debt service costs will rise which will add to the fiscal
imbalances. Aggravating the problem are entitlements that cannot be cut. This means
that the room for a fiscal consolidation without an increase in fiscal space could move
the US in the direction of a debt crisis. (Slok 2018). This is a different imbalance than

In private correspondence with Robert Leeson September 15 1999, available from
the Hoover Institution Archives, Milton Friedman praised George Shultz for his role
in ending the par value system and creating the managed float.
“You give George Shultz much credit, and he fully deserves it and more. He has a fine
mind and an even more unusual character. What impressed me most about him—
under both Nixon and Reagan is that in dealing with a problem, his first step is to
consider long-term consequences and only then ask how various short time
measures will contribute to the desirable long term outcome”

in the 60s and 70s but is still a serious one. Indeed a sovereign debt crisis would
threaten the credibility of the dollar as an international currency (Eichengreen 2010).
A second source of resonance from the earlier crisis is the use of tariff protection. At
Camp David the 10 % temporary import surcharge was imposed as a strategic
bargaining tool to force the surplus countries to adjust. It was successful in leading to
the Smithsonian agreement but in the end the only solution to the problem of the
imbalances of the BWS was floating exchange rates. Today the use of tariffs as a threat
to force trading partners (especially China) to change their industrial policies risks
the same kind of reaction that ultimately made the Camp David strategy fail in the
sense that the Smithsonian Agreement only lasted several months as the underlying
deep fiscal and monetary imbalances became even worse. It also raises the specter of
a trade war such as occurred in the 1930s which greatly exacerbated the Great
Depression.
