1         Introduction
Any economics undergraduate worthy of a B learns this key policy implication
of the Mundell-Fleming model: if an economy is predominantly hit by foreign
real shocks, ‡exible exchange rates dominate …xed rates.1 The basic logic is
due to Milton Friedman (1953): nominal rigidities make it both faster and
less costly to adjust the nominal exchange rate in response to a shock that
requires a fall of the real exchange rate. The alternative is to wait until
excess demand in the goods and labor market pushes nominal wages and
goods’ prices down, with the consequent decline in output and employment.
    This basic policy prescription is still found in textbooks and continues
to be taught to undergraduates, but has come under attack recently from
both academic economists and policy gurus. The real-world trigger for this
shift, of course, was the Asian crisis. Countries that, like Indonesia, let their
exchange rates go early on endured substantial real depreciations and seemed,
at least at …rst, to more troubled than those that held on. An overshooting
exchange rate was blamed for debt-service di¢culties, bank and corporate
bankruptcies and, in some cases, rising in‡ation.
    The academic onslaught includes the work of Calvo (1999 and 2000),
Krugman (1999 and 2000), Stein, Hausmann, Gavin, and Pagés-Serra (1999),
and Aghion, Bachetta and Banerjee (1999). Details di¤er, but most argu-
ments are built upon the following blocks:
    The transfer problem: external shocks, such as a fall in export demand,
may require large real devaluations to restore equilibrium to external ac-
counts.
    Dollarization of liabilities: if debts are denominated in dollars while …rms
depend on local currency revenues (or, more precisely, revenues increase with
the relative price of goods produced at home), sharp and unexpected changes
in relative prices matter for …nancial stability.
    Balance sheets and risk premia: if a sharp devaluation wreaks havoc with
bank and corporate balance sheets, country risk premia will increase.
    This combination causes, in some cases, the domestic e¤ects of external
shocks to be magni…ed and made persistent. In others, it opens the door
to multiple equilibria, so that the expectation of a large devaluation causes
one to occur and damage …nancial health enough to justify the initially pes-
simistic expectations. But in most cases sudden depreciations turn out to

be contractionary, not expansionary as in the Mundell-Fleming model. The
insulating role of ‡exible exchange rates allegedly disappears.
    In this paper we investigate under which conditions, if any, this cur-
rently fashionable conclusion holds. To this end, we build a model of a small
open economy in which real exchange rates play a central role in the adjust-
ment process, wages are sticky,2 liabilities are “dollarized,” and the country
risk premium is endogenously determined by the net worth of domestic en-
trepreneurs. Hence all the basic building blocks are there for unexpected
real exchange rate movements to be …nancially dangerous, and for ‡exible
exchange rates to be destabilizing. Nonetheless we show, somewhat sur-
prisingly, that the Mundell-Fleming logic survives pretty much unscathed.
Flexible exchange rates do play an insulating role in the presence of real ex-
ternal shocks, except in one case that is theoretically possible but empirically
implausible.
    We are led to these conclusions in spite of the presence of balance sheet
e¤ects. Balance sheet e¤ects do matter a great deal in our model, in that
they magnify the e¤ects of foreign disturbances. Indeed, we can distinguish
between a situation of high indebtedness and the resulting …nancial fragility,
so that a real depreciation raises the country risk premium; and one of …nan-
cial robustness, in which the opposite happens. The magni…cation e¤ect is
especially pronounced under …nancial fragility because endogenous increases
in country risk have lasting and potentially large e¤ects on domestic vari-
ables. But regardless of which of these two situations the economy …nds
itself in, ‡uctuations in home output and investment are larger and more
persistent under …xed than under ‡exible exchange rates.
    We consider shocks to the world real interest rate and to world demand
for the country’s exports. In both cases, the impact real depreciation is
larger under ‡exible rates. This extra depreciation turns out to be “expan-
sionary” in that it moderates the output e¤ects of the shock. Two standard
mechanisms turn out to be essential:
    Real exchange rates and real interest rates: Having …xed exchange rates
does not mean that real depreciations are completely avoided; instead, they
are spread di¤erently through time. In our model, adverse external shocks
cause a larger impact real depreciation under ‡exible rates, but a larger
expected real depreciation under …xed rates. Ceteris paribus, this causes
domestic real interest rates to be higher under a peg, adversely a¤ecting
  2
      This turns out to be simpler, but sticky prices would play a similar role.

current investment and future output.
    Real exchange rates and real wages: Under …xed rates, an impact real
depreciation, however small, can only be achieved via de‡ation. With sticky
wages, this means that the real wage goes up temporarily, and output and
employment fall. This does not occur under ‡exible rates.
    In addition, the model features novel and interesting links between ex-
change rates, the …nancial sector, and the real economy:
    Real exchange rates and net worth: it is true that, after a shock, the initial
devaluation of the exchange rate reduces net worth since debt is denominated
in dollars. This could suggest that net worth is lower in the case of ‡oating.
But that conclusion would be wrong, because this is not the whole story.
Under …xed exchange rates, there is also a real depreciation, albeit smaller
than under ‡oating, caused by de‡ation. In addition, net worth is a¤ected
negatively by the initial fall in output that takes place under a peg. The net
result is that net worth is always lower under …xed rates.
    Real exchange rates and risk premia: in the model below, risk premia
depend on the ratio of current investment to …rms’ net worth. But of these
are a¤ected in complex ways by changes in the real exchange rate. We have
seen that net worth is always higher under a ‡oat. But the domestic value of
current investment is also always higher under a ‡oat. The net e¤ect could
in principle go either way. In our simple setup it turns out these e¤ects
exactly o¤set each other, so that risk premia are the same across exchange
rate regimes. This in spite of the initial larger increase in debt service under
‡exible rates.
    Real exchange rates and external debt: under ‡exible rates, unexpected
real depreciations can in fact cause the ex post real rate of interest to jump
up, thus tending to increase subsequent debt accumulation. But this does not
mean that, following a shock, debt is necessarily higher under a ‡oat. Risk
premia need not increase more, as we have seen. And a more depreciated real
exchange rate can reduce the import content of domestic investment, which
in turn tends to limit debt growth.
    In short: the connections among real exchange rates, net worth and risk
premia are complex, and much of the recent policy debate misses this com-
plexity altogether. Once the di¤erent e¤ects are tallied up, it turns out that
net worth and risk premia perform no worse under ‡exible exchange rates,
while home output is higher.
    The model below is quite rich, with an in…nite horizon, optimizing …rms
and households, and endogenous risk premia à la Bernanke and Gertler

(1989). Nonetheless we are able to obtain closed form solutions for all vari-
ables of interest, so that the previous claims can easily be proven analytically.
In this sense, our solution methods are similar in spirit the those emphasized
by Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (1995) and may be of independent interest, as they
can be used in a variety of settings.
    The paper is organized in the following way. The next section lays down
the basic model, while section 3 studies the characteristics of the steady state
and of convergence to it. Section 4 o¤ers an analytical treatment of the reac-
tion of the economy to a shock in the world real interest rate, assuming that
all nominal prices and wages are ‡exible. In section 5 we adapt the analy-
sis to the case of sticky wages, and compare regimes of ‡exible and …xed
exchange rates. In section 6 we simulate the model for two di¤erent parame-
ter con…gurations (corresponding to …nancially fragile and robust economies)
and for a larger set of shocks. Section 7 concludes. Some technical material
is deferred to an appendix.


2     The Model
We study an in…nite-horizon, small and open home economy. In this economy
a single good is produced by competitive …rms using labor and capital, and
is exported or sold to domestic agents. Labor and capital are supplied by
distinct agents called workers and capitalists. These agents consume and,
in the case of capitalists, invest an aggregate of the home good and a single
imported good.
    Capitalists …nance investment in excess of their own net worth by borrow-
ing from foreigners. The key aspect of the model is that the cost of borrowing
depends inversely on net worth relative to the amount borrowed. In this way
the model incorporates the “balance sheet e¤ects,” emphasized by Bernanke
and Gertler (1989) and many papers since.

2.1    Domestic Production
Production of the home good is carried out by competitive …rms, which take
all prices as given, and have access to a common technology:

                          Yt = AKt® L1¡®
                                     t   ,0<®<1                              (1)



                                       4
where Yt denotes home output in period t, Kt denotes capital input, Lt
denotes labor input, and A is a positive constant.
    We assume, as in Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (2000), that workers are heteroge-
neous. As a consequence, the input Lt is an aggregate of the services of the
di¤erent workers in the economy. A simple speci…cation capturing this idea
is that Lt is a CES aggregate
                              ·Z   1                   ¸ ¾¡1
                                                          ¾
                                             ¾¡1
                       Lt =            Lit    ¾    di            ; ¾ > 1;   (2)
                               0

where we have indexed workers by i in the unit interval, and Lit denotes the
services purchased from worker i: Under this speci…cation, ¾ is the elasticity
of demand for worker i’s services.
    In every period, the representative …rm’s problem is to maximize pro…ts,
given by                                 Z                 1

subject to 1 and 2, where Pt is the price of the home good, Rt the rental
rate of capital, and Wit worker i0 s wage rate, all expressed in terms of the
domestic currency (henceforth called peso).
    The solution to this problem is standard. The minimum cost of a unit of
Lt is given by
                                       ·Z    1                   ¸ 1¡¾
                                                                    1
                                                       1¡¾
                           Wt =                  Wit           di           (3)
                                         0

which can be taken to be the aggregate wage. With this de…nition, fac-
tor demands will be such that, in equilibrium, factor prices equal marginal
productivities:
                                 Rt      Yt
                                    =®                                  (4)
                                 Pt      Kt
                              Wt            Yt
                                  = (1 ¡ ®)                             (5)
                              Pt            Lt
In addition, cost minimization yields the demand for worker i0 s labor:
                                            µ          ¶¡¾
                                    Wit
                              Lit =                              Lt         (6)
                                    Wt
Finally, pro…ts are zero in equilibrium.

consumption in period t and his wage Wi;t+1 for next period; in this case,
he commits to supply his labor according to demand. Obviously, only in the
second case will monetary and exchange rate policy a¤ect real allocations.
    Regardless of whether wages are sticky or ‡exible, purchasing consump-
tion at minimum cost requires
                           Ã         !
                               1¡°       CtH   St
                                           F
                                             =    ´ Et                      (10)
                                °        Ct    Pt
where we have imposed symmetry in equilibrium and dropped the subscript
i. Also, we have de…ned Et , the real exchange rate.
    The minimum cost of one unit of consumption is given by

                                 Qt = Pt° St1¡°                             (11)

   If wages are ‡exible, each worker will set his wage to equate his marginal
disutility of labor to its marginal return. Our assumptions on preferences
then ensure that
                                    Lt = 1
in equilibrium.
    If wages are sticky, it is easy to show that they will be set so that
                                        º
                                     t Lt+1   =1                            (12)

and, in that case, the employment of labor will be given by the demand
condition 5.

2.3    Capitalists
Capitalists are the key players in our model, as they …nance investment partly
with foreign loans, and foreign borrowing is subject to frictions. These fric-
tions can be, in principle, due to informational or enforcement problems. The
details are, however, somewhat peripheral to our line of discussion, and hence
this section is limited to describing the main aspects of the aggregate behav-
ior of capitalists. That behavior is justi…ed by more primitive assumptions
about fundamentals in the appendix.
    To describe the capitalists’ behavior, it is best to begin at the end of some
period t. At that point, the capitalists have some net worth Pt Nt , expressed
in pesos, and have access to a world capital market where the safe interest

                                          7
rate for dollars borrowed between t and t+1 is given by ½t+1 , which is random
but becomes known at t.
   Capitalist can invests in capital for next period, which they produce by
assembling home goods and imports in the same fashion as 8. As a conse-
quence, the cost of one unit of capital in t + 1 is Qt , as given by 11, and the
capitalists’ budget constraint is

                           Pt Nt + St Dt+1 = Qt Kt+1                        (13)

where Dt+1 denotes the amount borrowed abroad and Kt+1 his investment
in (t + 1) capital.
    Crucially, the interest cost of borrowing abroad is not simply the world
safe
³     rate ´½³t . Instead,
                        ´ capitalists borrow abroad at the gross interest rate
 1 + ½t+1 1 + ´ t+1 where ´ t+1 is a risk premium. And, following Bernanke,
Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), we assume that the risk premium is given by
                               µ           ¶
                                   Qt Kt+1
                1 + ´t+1 = F               , F (1) = 1, F 0 (:) > 0         (14)
                                    Pt Nt
that is, the risk premium is an increasing function of the value of investment
relative to net worth. Again, Appendix 1 justi…es this speci…cation with
primitive assumptions on the economy’s fundamentals. For concreteness, we
shall assume the following functional form for F :

                               F (g) = g ¹ , ¹ > 0                          (15)

at least in the neighborhood of the steady state.
    Capitalists are risk neutral, and choose Dt+1 and Kt+1 so as to equate
the return on investment to the cost of foreign borrowing. For simplicity, we
assume that capital depreciates completely in production. Hence the yield
on capital, in dollars, will be Rt+1 Kt+1 =St+1 which, in equilibrium, will equal
®Pt+1 Yt+1 =St+1 by 4. The equality of the expected return on investment to
the cost of foreign borrowing then implies

                ® t (Pt+1 Yt+1 =St+1 ) ³          ´³          ´
                                      = 1 + ½t+1 1 + ´t+1                 (16)
                     Qt Kt+1 =St
   At the beginning of each period, capitalists collect the income from capital
and repay foreign debt. Assume that they consume a portion 1 ¡ ± of the
remainder, and that (in true capitalist style) they only consume imports. As
a consequence, their net worth is

                                          8
                   Pt Nt = ± fRt Kt ¡ (1 + ½t ) (1 + ´ t ) St Dt g                   (17)
                         = ± f®Pt Yt ¡ (1 + ½t ) (1 + ´ t ) St Dt g                  (18)

    Note that –holding real income constant– a real devaluation, de…ned as
an increase in Et = St =Pt ; will have a negative impact on net worth and,
ceteris paribus, increase the risk premium. This will be a key and novel
aspect in our analysis.3 Also, notice that if ° = 0 –that is, if all capital
were composed of foreign goods– then the risk premium would be indepen-
dent of the real exchange rate. This is the real-economy counterpart of the
problem of “dollarization” of liabilities stressed by Calvo (1999, 2000) and
others. Because domestic capitalists’ productive assets and liabilities consist
of di¤erent goods, changes in relative prices a¤ect their creditworthiness.

2.4     Equilibrium
Market clearing for home goods requires that domestic output be equal to
demand. As we have seen, domestic expenditure in home goods is a fraction
° of …nal expenditures. In addition, the home good may be sold to foreigners.
Since we want to allow for shocks to foreign demand, we simply assume that
the value of home exports in dollars is exogenous and given by some random
process Xt :4
    The preceding paragraph then implies that the market for home goods
will clear when
                       Pt Yt = °Qt (Kt+1 + Ct ) + St Xt                  (19)
and note that, because workers consume their wages in each period,

                            Qt Ct = Wt Lt = (1 ¡ ®)Pt Yt                             (20)

    Rational expectations equilibria are de…ned in the usual way, after spec-
ifying stochastic processes for ½t and Xt . If wages are ‡exible, Lt = 1; and
1, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20 can be solved for Yt ; Rt ; Wt ; Kt+1 ;
Dt+1 ; ´ t+1 ; Nt ; Ct ; and the relative prices Qt =Pt and St =Pt : If wages are
   3
    See also Céspedes (2000).
   4
    This is similar to Krugman (1999), and can be justi…ed by positing that the foreign
elasticity of substitution in consumption is one, but that foreigners expenditure share in
domestic goods is negligible.


                                            9
sticky, 12 and the preceding set of equations can be solved for Lt , Yt ; Rt ; Wt ;
Kt+1 ; Dt+1 ; ´ t+1 ; Nt ; Ct ; and the nominal prices Qt ; St and Pt ; once some
assumption about monetary policy is imposed.
    The astute reader may have noted that we have not laid out the mone-
tary side of the model –and in particular an expression for money demand–
explicitly. As discussed by Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1998), Galí and
Monacelli (1999) and others, this is legitimate for a class of monetary policy
rules that includes the ones we are concerned with. More precisely, it would
be straightforward to amend the model so that there is an equation for the
real demand for pesos; then the central bank would implement the policies
we discuss below by suitable adjustments in nominal interest rate and/or the
supply of pesos.
    A nontrivial analysis of monetary and exchange rate policy is only possible
under sticky wages. However, analysis of the ‡exible wage case will aid the
understanding the dynamics of the model, so we will examine both cases in
turn. But …rst we turn to the existence of steady states and the convergence
properties of the model.


3     Steady States and Convergence Under Per-
      fect Foresight
3.1    Steady States
A steady state can be de…ned in the usual way and is the same regardless
of assumptions about wage rigidity. Absence of time subscripts will denote
steady state values.
    Clearly, in a steady state L = 1, and there is no loss of generality in
normalizing P = 1; hence the nominal exchange rate S coincides with the
real exchange rate E, and the cost of investment Q is measured relative to
the price of home output. The steady state is then given by:

                                    Y = AK ®                                  (21)
                                    Q = S 1¡°                                 (22)

                                     QK ¹
                              1+´ =                                       (24)
                                      N
                              N + SD = QK                                 (25)
                       N = ±[®Y ¡ (1 + ½)(1 + ´)SD]                       (26)
                        Y = °[(1 ¡ ®)Y + QK] + SX                         (27)
    Equation 21 is the steady state version of the production function 1.
Likewise, 22 corresponds to 11, 23 to 16, 24 to 14, 25 to 13, 26 to 17, and 27
to 19.
    Now it is easy to show that there is a unique, nontrivial steady state.
Replace 23 and 25 in 26 and rearrange to obtain

                    [1 ¡ ±(1 + ½)(1 + ´)] (QK ¡ SD) = 0

But QK cannot equal SD if net worth is to be positive, as required in a
nontrivial steady state. Hence ±(1 + ½)(1 + ´) must equal 1 or

                             1 + ´ = [±(1 + ½)]¡1                         (28)

which pins down the risk premium in the steady state. Note that for ´ > 0
one needs ±(1 + ½) < 1; that is, ± must be small enough.
   Equations (23) and (28) now yield

                                 ±®Y = QK                                 (29)

That is, in the steady state the value of investment is equal to the fraction
of capital income that is not consumed. This and 27 yield

                        [1 ¡ °(1 ¡ ® ¡ ®±)] Y = SX                        (30)

Since 1 ¡ °(1 ¡ ® ¡ ®±) > 0; this is a ray from the origin in (Y; S) space, and
can be thought of as an “IS curve” in the steady state..
   To …nd a second relationship, use 21 and 22 in 29 to get
                                            µ       ¶1=®
                                      1¡°       Y
                            ®±Y = S
                                                A
The L.H.S. is income invested, the RHS is the value of capital bought. This
can be rewritten as
                         ®±A1=® = S 1¡° Y (1¡®)=® ;                    (31)

                                      11
which is a hyperbola in (Y; S) space. The steady state values of S and Y
must solve 30 and 31. Clearly, there is a unique positive solution.
   The other steady state variables are determined immediately. In partic-
ular, from 24 and 28,
                             h                 i¡1
                QK=SD = 1 ¡ (1 + ´)¡1=¹              = f1 ¡ [±(1 + ½)]1=¹ g¡1             (32)

It will turn out that QK=SD, the ratio of the value of investment to the
value of foreign debt in the steady state, is crucial. Expression 32 shows that
this ratio depends only on the steady state risk premium and the parameter
¹:

3.2      The linearized system
The equations that characterize equilibrium can be log-linearized around the
steady state. The resulting system includes, whether wages are ‡exible or
sticky, the following:
                           yt = ®kt + (1 ¡ ®)lt                         (33)
                                 qt ¡ pt = (1 ¡ °) (st ¡ pt )                             (34)
                     yt = ¸ (kt+1 + qt ¡ pt ) + (1 ¡ ¸) (st ¡ pt + xt )                   (35)


      t yt+1   ¡ (qt ¡ pt ) ¡ kt+1 = ½0t+1 + ´ 0t+1 + (st+1 ¡ pt+1 ) ¡ (st ¡ pt )         (36)

´0t+1 ¡´0t = ¹f(qt ¡ pt + kt+1 ¡ yt )+Ã [(st ¡ pt ¡        t¡1 (st   ¡ pt )) ¡ (yt ¡   t¡1 yt )]g
                                                                            (37)
                                                                     ¡1
where ¸ = ®°±=(1 ¡ ° + ®°); Ã = [(QK=SD) ¡ 1] , lower case letters
denote percentage deviations from steady state values, and ½0t and ´ 0t denote
deviations from their steady state levels.
    Expression 33 is the log-linear version of the production function, while
34 is the logarithmic version of 11, the de…nition of the price index qt ¡ pt .
Equation 35 gives market equilibrium for the home good: the portion of
output not consumed by workers is either invested or exported, with both
investment and exports expressed in terms of the home good.
    Equation 36 is the interest arbitrage equation. The LHS shows the mar-
ginal return in t + 1 on an unit invested in domestic capital in period t, while
the RHS shows the relevant rate of interest on foreign borrowing (inclusive
of the risk premium) expressed in terms of the home good.

                                              12
    Finally, expression 37 shows the evolution of the risk premium.
    While all other expressions, 37 will be the source of the novel twists in
the analysis. To obtain an insight into this condition, use 35 to eliminate the
term (kt+1 + qt ¡ pt ) from 37 and recall that the real exchange rate et equals
st ¡ pt to obtain
                Ã        !
                    1¡¸           1¡¸
´0t+1 ¡´ 0t
          = ¡¹             xt +¹(        ) (yt ¡ et )+¹Ã [(et ¡t¡1 et )¡(yt ¡t¡1 yt )]
                      ¸              ¸
                                                                               (38)
    This expression decomposes the change in the risk premium into three
e¤ects, captured by the three terms in the RHS sum. The …rst is exogenous
shocks to export demand: a fall in exports, given home output, must be
compensated by an increase in investment, and consequently more foreign
debt and a higher risk premium. The second term re‡ects a similar e¤ect
from an increase of output, measured in dollars: given exports, an increase
in (yt ¡ et ) must be matched by more investment, debt, and a higher risk
premium. The third term in the sum re‡ects unexpected changes in net worth.
An unexpected real devaluation increases the burden of inherited debt, hence
reducing net worth relative to the cost of investment. The same happens if
output falls unexpectedly, since this reduces capitalists’ reward from previous
investment. In both cases, the fall in net worth pushes up the risk premium.
    Importantly, holding previous expectations constant, a fall in dollar out-
put, due to either a real devaluation (an increase in et ) or a reduction in
home output (a fall in yt ), may be associated with either an increase or a
decrease
     ³
          in
           ´
              the risk premium ´ 0t+1 . For an increase, it must be the case that
Ã > 1¡¸ ¸
             ; this re‡ects that a fall in dollar output leads to less investment,
which reduces the risk premium, but also to a fall in net worth, which in-
creases it. The net worth e¤ect dominates if Ã is large enough or, from the
de…nition of Ã, if foreign debt is large enough in the steady state. Alter-
                                                  N
natively, this condition can be written as QK         < ¸: a fall in dollar output
increases the risk premium if steady-state net worth is su¢ciently small.

3.3      Convergence under perfect foresight
To examine convergence to the steady state, assume that there are no sto-
chastic shocks hitting the system. In such a case, wage rigidity has no real
consequences, and lt = 1. Also, xt = ½0t+1 = 0; and expected and realized val-
ues coincide for any variable. With these simpli…cations, the system (33)-(37)

                                         13

stability requires that one eigenvalue of © be inside and the other one outside
the unit circle. Some algebra, described in the Appendix, reveals that this is
always the case, and hence the system displays saddle path stability.
    Along the saddle path, the jump variable z is a unique and linear function
of the predetermined variable ´ 0 , say zt = ¯´ 0t , where ¯ is a negative coe¢cient
whose value can be computed using standard methods (see the appendix).
The negativity of ¯ implies that, when the risk premium ´ t is above its steady
state level, dollar output zt is below its own steady state level, and viceversa.
This implication seems intuitive.


4         Interest Rate Shocks With Flexible Wages
Our model can be simulated under di¤erent assumptions on shocks, wage
rigidity, and policy,5 and indeed we do so in a later section. However, it is
illuminating …rst to examine analytically the dynamic behavior of the model.
While this can only be done under somewhat strong assumptions, it yields
insights on the model’s behavior even after those assumptions are relaxed.
    In this section we assume that wages are ‡exible (so that lt = 0) and that
all shocks are i.i.d., and focus on the e¤ect of a sudden shock to the world
interest rate. Suppose that the system starts from steady state, and that
at t = 0 the world interest rate ½1 rises unexpectedly. From the period 0
versions of 33, 34, and 36, interest arbitrage reduces to
                                       µ        ¶

                                            ®
        Now, from 34 and 35, we have

This means that investment in period 0 and output in period one must fall
with a real devaluation (an increase in e0 ). The reason is that if e0 increases,
more home output must be exported in period 0. But home output cannot
respond to an interest rate shock in period 0: the capital stock is predeter-
mined, and our preference speci…cation implies that l0 = 0 in the ‡exible
wage case. Hence investment must fall.

        Assuming, of course, that ‡uctuations around the steady state are “small.”

is the elasticity of the risk premium with respect to a change in the real
exchange rate. This elasticity is an important parameter and, indeed, has
been a focus of recent literature. To put our analysis in context, we shall dis-
tinguish between a …nancially robust economy, that is, one in which "´e < 0,
and a …nancially vulnerable one, in which "´e > 0: Intuitively, balance sheet
e¤ects are “small” in the robust case and large in under …nancial vulnera-
bility; the …nancially vulnerable case is the one that has been emphasized
recently by Calvo (1999), Krugman (1999), and others.
    As should be clear from the de…nition of "´e ; whether an economy is
robust or vulnerable turns out to depend on the size of Ã vis a vis (1 ¡ ¸)=¸:
In particular, when the steady state ratio of debt to investment, SD=QK, is
large, then Ã is also large and the economy is more likely to be …nancially
vulnerable.
    Substituting 49 and 50 into the arbitrage condition 48 and rearranging
we have
                              µ                    ¶
                               1¡®
                      e1 =           + ®° ¡ "´e e0 ¡ ½01                  (52)
                                 ¸
This is a crucial relation between the real exchange rates in periods 0 and
1; we shall call it the EE curve. As we have discussed, it re‡ects primarily
interest arbitrage.
    The slope of the EE curve in (e0 ; e1 ) space may be positive or negative,
depending mainly on the sign and magnitude of "´e . The intuition is that,
holding ½01 constant, an increase in e0 reduces investment and increases the
return in capital. If the risk premium did not move, interest arbitrage would
only hold if e1 increased too; then the EE curve would slope up. However,
if the increase in e0 caused a su¢ciently large increase in the risk premium,
interest parity would require a fall in expected devaluation and, hence, a fall
in e1 : In such a case, the EE curve would slope down.
    A second relation between e0 and e1 can be derived from the fact that,
from period 1 on, the economy must be on the saddle path converging to

                                          16
the steady state. Recall that this implies that z1 = y1 ¡ e1 = ¯´01 . Hence
e1 = y1 ¡ ¯´ 01 which, after using 49 and 50 rearranging becomes
                                " Ã         !         #
                                 1 ¡ ¸°
                        e1 = ¡ ®                + ¯"´e e0                    (53)
                                    ¸
which is another linear equation in e0 and e1 that we shall call the FF curve.
    The slope of the FF curve can also be positive or negative, and again this
depends on the elasticity "´e . To see this, recall that an increase in e0 reduces
investment and period 1 output. Given ´ 01 ; z1 is determined by saddle path
stability. Hence, if ´01 did not move, a fall in e1 would be required to place
the economy on the converging saddle path. However, if "´e is positive, the
risk premium increases with e0 ; if this e¤ect is su¢ciently large, it may more
than o¤set the fall in y1 , and e1 would increase.
    The response to the real exchange rates e0 and e1 to the interest rate
shock ½01 is simply given by the intersection of the EE and the FF curves.
Then it is straightforward to calculate the behavior of the rest of the variables
of interest. The explicit solutions can be written as

                                   e0 = ¸µ½01                                (54)


                        e1 = ¡µ [® (1 ¡ ¸°) + ¯¸"´e ] ½01                    (55)
where
                             µ¡1 = 1 ¡ (1 ¡ ¯) ¸"´e                          (56)
   It is worth noting, at this point, that there is a unique equilibrium re-
sponse to the interest rate shock. In this regard, our discussion di¤ers from
that of Krugman (1999) and Aghion, Bachetta, and Banerjee (2000), both
of which emphasize the possibility of multiple equilibria.
   We are ready to examine the possibilities.

4.1     The …nancially robust economy
Recall that the economy is …nancially robust if a real devaluation in period
0 lowers the risk premium ("´e < 0). It is easy to see that if this condition
holds, and given that ¯ < 0, the EE curve must slope up and the FF curve
must slope down in (e0 ; e1 ) space. An unanticipated increase of the world
interest rate shifts the EE curve down but leaves the FF curve undisturbed.

                                       17
Hence the rate increase causes a real depreciation on impact (e0 > 0), which
is reversed in the next period (e1 < 0). This is depicted in panel 1A.
    We already noted that home output cannot respond to the interest rate
shock in period 0; equation 49 in turn implies that, since the exchange rate
rises in period 0, home output must fall in period 1. On the other hand,
because of the changes in the real exchange rate, the dollar value of output
z falls at …rst and then recovers. In period 0, the fall in z is identical to the
increase in e: z0 = ¡e0 < 0. In period 1, the saddle path trajectory dictates
z1 = ¯´ 01 = ¯"´e e0 > 0. Hence, the fall in dollar output turns out to be
temporary: it is above steady state levels in period 1 already. Thereafter, ´
rises and z falls until returning to the steady state.
    Hence, under …nancial robustness the response of the economy is fairly
conventional. This is not too surprising, as balance sheet e¤ects are small.
The sequence of events is depicted in panel 1B. At time 0 the system jumps
from the origin to point A, with an instant fall in dollar output taking place.
In period 1 the system moves to point B, with dollar output above and the
risk premium below their steady state levels. Gradual convergence takes
place starting at that point.

4.2    The …nancially vulnerable economy
By de…nition, in a …nancially vulnerable economy an impact devaluation
raises the risk premium ("´e > 0). However, the economy’s response to the
shock and, it particular, whether there is in fact a devaluation, depends on
the parameters of the economy, which determine the positions of the EE and
FF curves. From 54, two main possibilities emerge.
    (i) Even if "´e > 0, its magnitude may be su¢ciently small so that µ > 0:
In that case, 54 implies that there is still a real devaluation on impact (e0 >
0). In particular, 54 reveals that the size of the initial depreciation increases
with "´e or, equivalently, with the coe¢cient Ã. That is, a larger debt ratio,
holding other parameters constant, increases the sensitivity of the initial real
exchange rate to movements in world interest rates.
    The qualitative behavior of home output is the same as in the robust
case. But the fall in output in period 1 increases with the debt ratio Ã. Also,
…nancial vulnerability implies that the risk premium ´01 increases with the
initial depreciation. As a consequence, dollar output must fall in period 1



                                       18
for the economy to jump to the converging saddle path (z1 = ¯´01 < 0).6
    Finally, the real exchange rate in period 1 may be above or below its
steady state level. As seen in 55, e1 < 0 if "´e is small enough, and e1 > 0
otherwise. Figure 2 depicts the latter case.7 In 2A, the downward shift of
the EE curve causes both a real depreciation in both periods. In 2B, we see
that at time 0 the system jumps to point A. If ¡¯"´e > 1, then in period
1 it moves to point B on the saddle path, showing a protracted recession;
otherwise, it moves to point C on the saddle path. Gradual convergence, with
dollar output rising and the risk premium falling, takes place thereafter.
    (ii) It is possible that µ < 0, as would be clearly the case for very large
values of "´e : In this case, 54 implies that the interest rate increase causes
an initial appreciation of the peso (e0 < 0). This is counter-intuitive but
logically possible given a large enough balance sheet e¤ect. In addition, the
risk premium ´ 01 must fall, and investment in period 0, output in period 1;
and dollar output in periods 0 and 1 all must increase in response to the
shock.
    Clearly, while this case is logically possible, its empirical relevance is ques-
tionable. To believe that this case holds implies believing that an unfavorable
interest rate shock leads to an appreciation and to an expansion in economic
activity. In addition, in our numerical explorations of Section 6 we have been
unable to …nd plausible parameter con…gurations for which µ < 0:

4.3     Summary
Under …nancial robustness, a balance sheet e¤ect exists but is mild enough so
that the economy’s response to an interest rate shock goes along conventional
lines. But if balance sheet e¤ects are large enough for the risk premium to
increase with a devaluation, so that the economy is …nancially vulnerable,
behavior depends on parameter values. Except in cases that seem empiri-
cally implausible, …nancial vulnerability exacerbates the response of exchange
rates to interest rate shocks, and makes contractions in home output and dol-
lar output more persistent.

    Dollar output may rise or fall between periods zero and one.

    The case in which e1 < 0 corresponds, qualitatively, to the dynamics presented in
Figures 1A and 1B.

5    Sticky Wages and Exchange Rate Policy
We are now in a good position to consider the e¤ect of nominal rigidities
under alternative monetary and exchange rate policies. As noted earlier, our
assumption will be that nominal wages are predetermined for one period,
and allowed to move to market-clearing levels thereafter. This is enough to
ensure that monetary policy has real e¤ects, although it obviously implies
highly stylized and perhaps unrealistic dynamics for nominal aggregates.
   Our discussion will focus on the age old question of the contractionary
properties of alternative exchange rate regimes. As noted in the introduction,
the conventional wisdom has long been that ‡exible exchange rates are less
contractionary than …xed rates. But it has been recently argued that the
presence of balance sheet e¤ects may reverse this ranking.
   The (linearized) equilibrium equations 33-37 must still hold. In addition,
with sticky wages, the pre-set wage rate in period t must be such that

                                   t¡1 lt   =0                            (57)

which is the linear version of 12, and the linearized version of 5,

                              yt ¡ lt = wt ¡ pt ;                         (58)

determines employment. Hence, if we start from the steady state in period
0, 57 and 58 imply w0 =¡1 p0 , which applied to 58 yields

                       l0 ¡ y0 = ®l0 = p0 ¡      ¡1 p0   = p0 ;           (59)

after taking into account that y0 = ®k0 + (1 ¡ ®)l0 = (1 ¡ ®)l0 and that
¡1 p0 = 0. Equation 59 is, of course, a simple expectational Phillips curve.
    We keep the assumption that shocks are i.i.d. in this section, and again
focus on the e¤ect of an unanticipated increase in the world interest rate in
period 0: Notice that, since after one period all variables are free to adjust,
from t = 1 on the equilibrium of the model is identical to that computed
in the previous section: the economy settles on saddle path converging to
the steady state. Therefore, in analyzing the e¤ects of wage stickiness under
alternative monetary rules it is enough to focus what happens in the period
of the shock.




                                       20
5.1    Flexible exchange rates
We de…ne a regime of ‡exible exchange rates as one in which the central
bank uses its policy instrument (the money supply or an overnight interest
rate, for instance) to target the price of home output pt while letting the
nominal exchange rate st adjust to market conditions. In principle, such a
rule is consistent with any path for the price level. To make matters concrete
and simple, we assume that the authorities keep the price level constant in
response to shocks, so that pt =t¡1 pt = 0 for all t.
    The implications of this rule for the real exchange rate et are straightfor-
ward. Since et = st ¡ pt , the price targeting rule in force implies

                               et = st for all t:                          (60)
Hence movements in the nominal exchange rate are fully translated into
movements in the real exchange rate.
    In addition, 57, 58, and 59 imply that lt = wt = pt = wt ¡ pt = 0. That it,
the nominal and real wages are always at their steady state level, and labor
supply is constant and equal to its steady state level of one.
    This all means that the economy behaves just as in the ‡exible wages
case. All results of the previous section apply here, the only caveat being
that movements in the real exchange rate are accomplished instantaneously
through movements in the (‡oating) nominal exchange rate. Hence, ruling
out the (implausible) appreciation cases under …nancial vulnerability, the
temporary increase in the world real interest rate causes a real depreciation
in the period of the shock, while output is initially unchanged. The real
depreciation may cause an increase or decrease in the risk premium, depend-
ing on whether the economy is …nancially vulnerable or robust. This will
matter for the subsequent course of the real exchange rate. But regardless,
investment falls on impact, and output in the subsequent period is below its
steady state level.

5.2    Fixed exchange rates
Focus now on a policy of …xed exchange rates: st = 0 for all t. This means
the real exchange rate is given by

                                   et = ¡pt                                (61)


                                      21
That is, real depreciations (appreciations) can only be accomplished through
de‡ation (in‡ation).
    Consider the e¤ects of the unexpected increase of the world real interest
rate at time 0. From the production function we know that initial output
will be given by

                                    y0 = (1 ¡ ®) l0                         (62)
Using 59 to eliminate equilibrium labor use from this equation we arrive at
                            µ          ¶            µ   ¶
                            1¡®        1¡®
                       y0 =     p0 = ¡     e0                               (63)
                             ®          ®
so that, predictably, because wages are …xed in nominal terms, the real wage
will fall and output will increase if there is unexpected in‡ation. Using this
in 40 evaluated at 0 y1 = ®k1 ; we can solve for the level of investment in
period 0:
                                Ã          !        µ   ¶
                              1 ¡ ¸°      1¡®
                       k1 = ¡        e0 +     p0                            (64)
                                 ¸         ®¸
But since under …xed exchange rates e0 = ¡p0 , the previous equation be-
comes                 Ã         !        Ã         !
                        1 ¡ ¸°®            1 ¡ ¸°®
                 k1 =             p0 = ¡             e0             (65)
                           ¸®                 ¸®
so that unexpected in‡ation must raise investment. The intuition is that,
with …xed rates, in‡ation means appreciation, and this lowers the home good
value of exports, leaving more room for investment. In addition, unexpected
in‡ation also increases output, which pushes up investment.
   Using the equilibrium equations for period 0 one can also derive the fol-
lowing expression for the risk premium:
                   Ã            !               Ã           !
                      1¡¸               1¡¸
    ´ 01 = ¡¹®¡1   Ã¡     p0 = ¹®¡1 Ã ¡     e0 = ®¡1 "´e e0                 (66)
                       ¸                 ¸

As before, the direction of the response of the risk premium to a real devalu-
ation depends on the relative
                          ³    sizes of Ã and ¸ : a real depreciation increases
                               ´
the risk premium if Ã > 1¡¸  ¸
                                 , and vice-versa. In fact, the elasticity of the
premium with respect to the initial real exchange rate is the same as with
‡exible wages, but scaled up by ®¡1 : The intuition is that, in this case, an

                                           22
increased real exchange rate reduces net worth, and pushes up the risk pre-
mium, both by raising the burden of the foreign debt and by reducing output
and capital income. Importantly, these e¤ects have the same sign because
of the …xed exchange rates, which means that the real depreciation can only
come through de‡ation, which reduces output.
    As we did in the previous section, it is convenient to solve for period 0
and 1 variables in isolation. We know that e1 = ®k1 ¡ ¯´ 01 . Using 61, 65 and
66 in this expression we have
                                 Ã                   !
                               1 ¡ °¸®
                        e1 = ¡         + ®¡1 ¯"´e e0                       (67)
                                  ¸
which is the FF curve for this case. Note that, except for the role of ®, it is
very similar to the ‡exible wage FF curve.
   To derive another such expression, take the arbitrage equation 39 and
evaluate it at period 0, using the fact that y1 = ®k1 :

                 ®k1 ¡ [(1 ¡ °) e0 + k1 ] = e1 ¡ e0 + ½01 + ´ 01           (68)
Now use 65 and 66 in 68 to obtain
                            "        Ã        !              #
                       ¡1           1 ¡ °¸®
              e1 = ®        (1 ¡ ®)         + ®° ¡ "´e e0 ¡ ½01            (69)
                                       ¸
This is the EE curve for this case. These two curves can be solved explicitly
for
                                 e0 = ®¸µ½01                            (70)

                        e1 = ¡µ [® (1 ¡ ®°¸) + ¯¸"´e ] ½01                 (71)
where µ¡1 was de…ned in 56.
   Beyond this point the analysis depends on parameter con…gurations.

5.2.1   The …nancially robust economy
Recall this is the case in which a real devaluation in period 0 lowers the risk
premium. Then "´e < 0, and given that ¯ < 0 always, the EE curve slopes
up, and the FF curve slopes down. Clearly, the increase in the world interest
rate causes an initial real depreciation (e0 > 0), which is reversed in the next
period. But, unlike the case with ‡exible exchange rates, under …xed rates


                                         23
the real depreciation is achieved via an unexpected price de‡ation in period
0.
    This de‡ation, in turn, causes a fall in period 0 home output, as equation
63 shows. This is again di¤erent to the ‡exible rates case, in which output
remained constant in period 0 in response to the same shock. Also, equation
65 implies that the period 0 de‡ation causes investment to fall, and therefore
output also falls (relative to steady state) in period 1: y1 = ®k1 < 0. Finally,
using equation 63, dollar output in period 0 becomes z0 = ®¡1 p0 < 0; that
is, dollar output falls on impact, both because of the real depreciation and
the fall in home output.
    In period 1, the saddle path trajectory dictates z1 = ¯´ 01 . Using 66 to
eliminate ´ 01 from this expression we have

                            z1 = ¡¯®¡1 "´e e0 > 0                          (72)
Hence, the fall in dollar output turns out to be temporary: it is above its
steady state level in period 1 already. Thereafter, ´ rises and z falls until
returning to the steady state.
    Figure 1 can be reinterpreted to as to apply to this case. The only di¤er-
ence is that there is a di¤erence in magnitudes, and also that changes in real
exchange rates re‡ect changes in the opposite direction in the home price
level.

5.2.2   The …nancially vulnerable economy
Under …nancial vulnerability, "´e > 0, and µ ¡1 = 1 ¡ (1 ¡ ¯)¸"´e can be
positive or negative. When µ is positive, e0 > 0, and the interest rate shock
causes a real devaluation on impact, which is attained by an unexpected
de‡ation and the associated output contraction. If µ < 0, the reverse occurs.
    The behavior of the next period exchange rate is more complex. Expres-
sion 71 implies that e1 may be positive or negative when µ > 0, depending
on the slopes of EE and FF. The case in which EE is steeper, so that e1
is positive and we have a depreciation over two periods, is qualitatively the
same as Figure 2, although again there are di¤erences in magnitudes and
changes in e are translated into changes in p:




                                      24
5.3    Evaluating exchange rate regimes
How do the alternative exchange rate regimes compare when the economy
responds to an unexpected rise in world real interest rates? It turns out that
the crucial factor is not whether or not the economy is …nancially vulnera-
ble, but whether adjusting to the adverse interest rate shock requires a real
appreciation or devaluation.
    Consider, …rst, the case in which adjustment to the shock requires a real
devaluation (µ > 0). This is clearly the “normal” case. The impact behavior
of the real exchange rate is, from 54 and 70,

                          ef0 lex ¡ ef0 ix = (1 ¡ ®) ¸µ½01 > 0                    (73)

Hence, it is apparent that the initial movement of the real exchange rate is
smaller, in absolute value, with …xed than with ‡exible exchange rates. This
is as one should have expected. And, with µ > 0, 73 indicates that the initial
depreciation is larger under a ‡oat.
    From 55 and 71 we have

                         ef1 lex ¡ ef1 ix = (1 ¡ ®) ®¸°µ½01 > 0                   (74)

so that the subsequent real depreciation is also larger under ‡exible rates.
    The behavior of the risk premium is also interesting, and surprising given
recent policy discussions. From 50 and 66 we have
                                                       ³                ´
                      f lex               f ix
                (´01 )        ¡ (´ 01 )          = "´e ef0 lex ¡ ®¡1 ef0 ix = 0   (75)

where the second equality comes from using 54 and 70 to eliminate the terms
involving the real exchange rate. The change in the risk premium is the same
across regimes, regardless of whether the economy is …nancially vulnerable,
and contrary to the conjectures in much of the recent policy literature.
    The intuition is straightforward: as expression 38 implies, unexpected
movements in the risk premium depend not just on the behavior of the real
exchange rate, but on the response of overall dollar output. This is natural,
as the risk premium depends on net worth relative to the value of investment,
both of which depend on dollar output. Now, in this model dollar output
falls by the same amount independently of exchange rate policy. The real
exchange rate depreciates more under ‡exible rates, as we saw above. How-
ever, home output falls in period 0 if rates are …xed, while with ‡exible rates
it stays constant. The net e¤ect on the risk premium, consequently, is nil.

                                                     25
While the exact o¤set may be an artifact of the simplicity of the model, the
larger point should survive generalization: risk premia depend on investment
relative to net worth, a ratio that depends on several factors which react
di¤erently to movements in the real exchange rate. Hence, the sign of the
association between real depreciation and movements in country risk is likely
to be ambiguous.
    As mentioned, home output falls on impact with …xed rates, while it stays
put with ‡exible rates. Remarkably, the fall in home output in period 1 is
also larger with …xed rates. To see this, notice that, with ‡exible rates, y1
can be calculated, from 49 and 54 to be:

                                     y1f lex = ¡®(1 ¡ °¸)µ½01                                    (76)

while, with …xed exchange rates, 65, and 70 yield

                                     y1f ix = ¡®(1 ¡ ®°¸)µ½01                                    (77)

The di¤erence is
                               y1f lex ¡ y1f ix = ®(1 ¡ ®)¸°µ½01 > 0                             (78)
Output in period 1 falls in both cases, but the fall is larger with …xed ex-
change rates. Hence the Mundell-Fleming wisdom that adverse real shocks
imply a deeper contraction when exchange rates are …xed holds as long as
µ > 0.
    The period 1 response of output depends entirely on the course of in-
vestment in period 0, for in period 1 wages are ‡exible, labor supply is at
its steady state level, and therefore y1 = ®k1 . In turn, the di¤erence in in-
vestment depends on the di¤erence in real domestic interest rates. De…ning
r10 = ´01 + ½01 + (e0 ¡ e1 ) and using the fact that risk premia are equal across
regimes we have
                                                                          ³                  ´
                       f lex              f ix
              (r10 )           ¡ (r10 )           = (ef1 lex ¡ ef0 lex ) ¡ ef1 ix ¡ ef0 ix       (79)
which, using 73 and 74 becomes
                        f lex              f ix
               (r10 )           ¡ (r10 )          = ¡(1 ¡ ®) (1 ¡ ®°) ¸µ½01 < 0                  (80)
Hence, the expected real depreciation is larger under …xed rates, and this
keeps the domestic real interest rate high, a¤ecting investment. Once again,
this is all very much in line with the Mundell-Fleming logic.

                                                          26
    Finally, the evolution of net worth deserves attention. As we have noted,
under ‡exible rates it is true that the initial devaluation of the exchange rate
reduces net worth since debt is denominated in dollars. But there are other
forces that push in the opposite direction. The net result is that net worth
is always lower under …xed rates. This can be seen by noting that, with the
de…nitions of Q and E, equation 14 can be written as
                                       Ã              !¹
                                           E01¡° K1
                            1 + ´1 =                       ,                (81)
                                              N0

We have proven above that the L.H.S. is the same across regimes. On the
R.H.S., we have also shown that both variables in the numerator are smaller
under …xed rates. It follows that the denominator has to be smaller under
…xed rates.
    So far we have assumed that µ > 0; which implies that the interest rate
shock results in a real devaluation. If this is not the case (µ < 0), the
conventional conclusions from a comparison of …xed and ‡exible rates are
overturned. Recall that, in this case, the interest rate shock would imply a
real appreciation if wages are ‡exible, and a nominal appreciation if wages
are sticky but exchange rates are ‡exible. With …xed rates, the result is
an unexpected in‡ation, and an unanticipated expansion of home output.
Output also increases in period 1 and, by 78, the increase is larger than
under ‡exible exchange rates.
    But while the conventional ranking can be reversed theoretically, this
provides little ammunition to advocates of …xed rates. For this reversal
requires not only that the balance sheet e¤ect be very strong, but also that
the shock cause a real appreciation and an economic expansion on impact.
This is clearly implausible. In addition, our numerical work in the next
section suggests that it happens only for very extreme parameter values.
    What is the role of balance sheet e¤ects in all this? Financial vulnerability
means that a real devaluation increases the risk premium charged to the
home economy after an unexpected increase in world interest rates. Thus
understood, …nancial vulnerability is not, by itself, su¢cient to overturn the
conventional ranking of …xed versus ‡exible rates. If one believes that such a
shock must result in a real devaluation on impact, then …xed exchange rates
imply a deeper and more prolonged contraction than ‡exible rates whether
or not there is …nancial vulnerability.



                                       27
6     Some Numerical Explorations
In this section we parametrize our model and simulate it numerically. It is
not our purpose here to perform a calibration exercise of the “real business
cycle” type. Instead, we con…rm the results of our analysis of the e¤ects of an
interest rate shock, as well as give some concrete quantitative perspectives
of the dynamic response. We can also discuss the e¤ects of other shocks,
such as changes in the foreign demand for exports, that are more di¢cult
to study analytically. Finally, our numerical work indicates that the cases
we considered implausible on the basis of comparative dynamics can only
happen with extreme parameter values.

6.1    Parametrization
We set several parameters so that some long run predictions of the model
are empirically plausible. Thus, we set the steady state world interest rate
to 4 percent in annual terms. The home good share in the production of
capital and in the consumption index, °, is set at 0.6, which is consistent
with observed shares of imported goods in total output. The capital share
in the production of the home good, ®, is assumed to be 0.35, in line with
standard estimates.
    We choose the rest of the parameters in order to generate the cases of
…nancial robustness and …nancial vulnerability discussed earlier. In order to
have a robust economy, the capitalists’ saving rate ± is set to 0.94 and the
parameter ¹ in the risk premium formulation is set to 0.11. These parameters
imply a steady state ratio of investment expenditures to debt (QK=SD)
equal to 6 and a risk premium of 2 percent in annual terms. For a vulnerable
economy, ± and ¹ are chosen to imply a steady state risk premium of 4
percent, in annual terms, and a ratio of investment expenditures to debt
(QK=SD) that equals 1.2. In order to obtain these outcomes, the capitalist
rate of saving is set to 0.92 and ¹ is assumed to be 0.02.
    These parameters do not yield the “abnormal case” in which an increase
in the world real interest causes an impact appreciation of the real exchange
rate. Such a case turns out to require extreme and implausible parameter
values. To generate it, we must force the a ratio of investment to debt
(QK=ED) to 1.001, which implies a debt-net worth ratio (ED=P N) of 1000.
In turn, such ratios require values for ± and ¹ far away from the benchmark.
One possible combination is for ± to be 0.86 and ¹ to be 0.016; these values,

                                      28
in turn, generate a steady state risk premium of 12 percent. While it is
possible to simulate the model with this set of parameters, we regard this
case as too implausible for simulations to be useful. Hence we restrict the
rest of our discussion to the normal cases.

6.2     Shocks to the world interest rate
Figures 3-6 show the response of the economy to a temporary, 1 percent
increase in the world interest rate under ‡exible and …xed exchange rates.
The …gures are consistent with the results of the analytical sections. In
particular, output falls less in the robust economy than in the vulnerable
one. This follows from the role played by debt dollarization and the level
of indebtedness of the economy. The increase in the world interest rate
depreciates the exchange rate, which reduces the capitalists’ net worth. The
size of the net worth e¤ect depends directly on the steady state debt to net
worth ratio. The …nal e¤ect is a bigger reduction in investment in period 0
and output in period 1 for the …nancially vulnerable economy.
    In order to compare di¤erent exchange rate regimes, it is revealing to
focus on the evolution of the ex-post interest rate in terms of home goods.8
Under ‡exible exchange rates, the interest rate increases in both period 0
and in period 1. The increase in period 0 is explained by the unanticipated
depreciation of the exchange rate, which increases the burden of the inherited
debt in terms of the home good. In turn, the increase in the home goods
interest rate in period 1 re‡ects the increase in the world interest rate. Under
…xed exchange rates, the interest rate does not increase in period 0 but
increases strongly in period 1. This has a more negative e¤ect on investment,
and through this on output in the next period, than under ‡exible rates.
    Notice also, again in line with the analytical work, that movements in
dollar output, and consequently in the risk premium, are the same across
exchange rate regimes. And net worth is lower under …xed rates.
    In our simulations for the vulnerable economy case, the real exchange
rate in the second period always appreciates. This occurs because given our
parametrization, the term "´e is small. For parametrization that imply a
higher elasticity of the risk premium with respect to the real exchange rate
(a higher "´e ), the real exchange rate in period 1 will depreciate, as it was
   8
   Of course, in period 1 and thereafter ex post and ex ante real interest rates are the
same.

discussed in the previous sections.

6.3    Shocks to the demand for exports
Shocks to xt ; foreign expenditure on exports, can be approached analytically
as with shocks to the world interest rate. However, a change in x0 ;even if
temporary, a¤ects both k1 and ´ 01 ; and hence would shift both the EE and
FF curves. So our graphical exposition is less useful here, and it is more
e¢cient to look at impulse responses directly.
    The response of the economy to a temporary, one percent decrease in
exports under ‡exible and …xed exchange rates is described in Figures 7-10.
This shock creates a “transfer problem” and, under normal circumstances,
adjustment will require a real devaluation. This is indeed the case with our
parameter values.
    The …gures show that …nancial vulnerability is associated, even after a
partial output recovery in period 1, with a clearly deeper and more protracted
recession than in the case of …nancial robustness. In this sense, vulnerability
exacerbates the adverse e¤ects of the foreign demand shock.
    Again, this does not mean that …xed exchange rates are more successful
in dealing with the shock. Irrespectively of whether the economy is robust
or vulnerable, output does not respond on impact if rates are ‡exible: since
the price level is kept constant, the real wage does not respond to the shock,
and neither does output. However, the fall in exports leaves room for more
investment, and hence there is an initial increase in investment that generates
an increase in period 1 output.
    Under …xed rates, on the other hand, output falls in period 0. As in
the case of an interest rate shock, the required real depreciation is attained
through de‡ation, which increases the real wage and reduces output. As
a consequence, investment has less room to increase, and the initial loss in
output is followed by a close-to-nil increase in output.
    As in the case of interest rate shocks, the behavior of the risk premium
is the same across regimes. The intuition is essentially the same: the risk
premium is a¤ected not only by the exchange rate but also by the behavior
of the output. In both cases dollar output is the same and, again, in the
period of the shock net worth end up higher under ‡exible rates.
    So, although obviously some details di¤er, the analysis of the foreign
demand shock is similar to that of the interest rate shock. In particular, and


                                      30
in line with the Mundell -Fleming model, the contraction of output is deeper
with …xed exchange rates.


7     Final Remarks
Financial fragility is commonly cited nowadays as su¢cient reason to discard
‡exible exchange rates and adopt pegs, currency boards and even dollariza-
tion. Greater …xity of exchange rates may well be justi…ed on many economic
and non-economic grounds. But, this paper suggests, …nancial fragility alone
does not amount to a water-tight case against ‡oating.
    Financial fragility can mean di¤erent things to di¤erent people. Here we
have focused on perhaps the most common de…nition in policy discussions,
which links real exchange rates, debt service needs and the balance sheet of
…rms, and the country risk premium. According to this view, large debts
denominated in foreign currency render an economy …nancially fragile, in
that real devaluations destroy net worth and become contractionary and/or
destabilizing.
    What this view fails to recognize is that …rms’ creditworthiness depends
on a number of factors, which in turn react di¤erently to movements in the
real exchange rate. In our simple model, and for a given degree of …nancial
fragility, it is movements in dollar output (not in the real exchange rate alone)
that determine the evolution of the risk premium. Di¤erent exchange rate
policies a¤ect the breakdown of dollar output between quantity and price –
with ‡exible rates delivering a larger initial real depreciation but also a higher
level of home output in the aftermath of a shock– but not the evolution of
dollar output itself. Di¤erent degrees of …nancial fragility can change the
size and persistence of real e¤ects across exchange rate regimes, but not the
comparison between regimes.
    A related point is that, if a real shock calls for a real depreciation, this
will happen regardless of the exchange rate policy in place. What policy can
a¤ect is the distribution of the real depreciation over time, with …xed rates
minimizing the size of the initial shift in relative prices. But the other side of
this coin is that, after the initial period, expected real depreciations are higher
under …xed rates and so are, therefore, domestic real interest rates. This also
has deleterious e¤ects on balance sheets, as well as reducing investment and
future output.
    The model in this paper is very simple –so much so that it can be handled

                                        31
analytically. We obtained that simplicity at the expense of some assumptions
that rigor-minded readers may …nd distasteful. Households do not have ac-
cess to the capital market, and therefore cannot save; capitalists’ saving rate
is exogenous and constant; capital depreciates fully; wages are pre-set for
only one period; debt is arbitrarily (though plausibly) assumed to be denom-
inated in terms of the foreign good; the monetary sector is not fully speci…ed.
All these limitations in the analysis could be lifted, but at the obvious cost
of much complication. We are con…dent that the main conclusions of the
analysis would survive, but that conjecture remains to be proven.
    A more powerful objection is that here we have solved the model under
a particularly simple and implausible speci…cation of shocks. A solution to
the fully stochastic model would change matters in several respects. An im-
portant one is that the expected greater variability of relative prices under
‡oating could endogenously a¤ect the equilibrium risk premium. But that
need not turn the policy balance in favor of …xed rates. Large expected
variability of relative prices would also create incentives for domestic capi-
talists to denominate their foreign borrowing in terms of home rather than
foreign goods. With less “dollarization” of liabilities the link between real
exchange rate movements and …nancial fragility would be greatly weakened,
as Hausmann and Eichengreen (1999) and a number of other analysts have
observed.

8     Appendices
8.1     The risk premium
The purpose of this appendix is to sketch a justi…cation for our speci…cation
of the risk premium (equations 14 and 16 in the main text). In the open
economy this problem has been studied by Cespedes (2000). The argument
outlined below follows Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1998, henceforth
BGG) closely, but our speci…cation of the risk premium may be derived
under other assumptions.
    Consider the contracting problem between a single entrepreneur, indexed
by j, and foreign lenders in any period t: At the time of contracting, j’s
net worth (Pt Ntj ), the dollar interest rate (½t+1 ), and prices in period t are
known. For now, assume also that the period t + 1 rental rate on capital in
dollars, Rt+1 =St+1 , is known; this assumption will be dropped shortly.
    Entrepreneurs and foreign creditors are risk neutral. Their joint problem
                                          j                         j
is to choose a level of investment (Kt+1     ), a dollar loan (Dt+1    ), and a repay-
ment schedule so as to maximize the expected return to the entrepreneur,
such that creditors are paid at least their opportunity cost of funds, and
subject to resource and information constraints. The latter are described
                                          j
as follows. Investment in period t, Kt+1      ; yields ! jt+1 Kt+1
                                                               j
                                                                   (Rt+1 =St+1 ) dollars
next period, where ! jt+1 is a random shock. The distribution of ! jt+1 is public
information and is such that ! jt+1 is i.i.d. across j and t; and its expectation
is one: Crucially, as in Townsend (1979) and Williamson (1987), we assume
that the realization of ! jt+1 cannot be observed by lenders unless they pay
a proportional monitoring cost of ³! jt+1 Kt+1  j
                                                   (Rt+1 =St+1 ); in contrast, ! jt+1 is
observed freely by the entrepreneur.
    Under these conditions, it has been shown by Williamson (1987) that the
optimal contract is a standard debt contract. Such a contract stipulates a
                               j
…xed repayment, say of Bt+1       dollars; if the entrepreneur cannot repay that
amount, lenders monitor the outcome and seize the whole yield on the invest-
ment. Clearly, monitoring occurs only if the realization of ! jt+1 is low enough.
                              j         j
Letting !¹ be such that Bt+1     =! ¹ Kt+1  (Rt+1 =St+1 ), monitoring occurs if and
          j
only if ! t+1 is below !¹ ; an event interpretable as bankruptcy.
    The resulting problem is formally identical to that analyzed in Appendix
A of BGG. For our purposes, its key feature is that, to provide the lender




                                          33
with an expected return of ½t+1 , it must be the case that
                     ½                           Z    !

                                                                                = (1+½t+1 )Dt+1
                                                  0
                                                                                          (82)
                                            j
                          = (1 + ½t+1 )(Qt Kt+1 ¡ Pt Ntj )=St
where G(:) denotes the c.d.f. of ! jt+1 : The LHS gives the expected dollar
yield on investment. With probability 1 ¡ G(¹   ! ) there is no bankruptcy, and
                     j          j
lenders are repaid Bt+1 = !  ¹ Kt+1 (Rt+1 =St+1 ): With probability G(¹      ! ), the
entrepreneur goes bankrupt, and lenders are repaid whatever    R
                                                                        is left after
                                              j
monitoring costs; this is the term (1 ¡ ³)Kt+1    (Rt+1 =St+1 ) 0!¹ ! jt+1 dG(! jt+1 ):
                                                       j
The RHS gives the opportunity cost of the loan Dt+1        : The …nal line takes
into account that the loan must equal the value of investment minus the
entrepreneur’s net worth.
    The optimal contract maximizes the entrepreneur’s utility subject to 82.
As in Williamson (1987), a key aspect of the contract is that it minimizes
expected monitoring costs. Moreover, expected monitoring costs decrease
with net worth, which should be intuitive.
    BGG show that the solution to the contract problem implies

                             j                Rt+1 St
                         Qt Kt+1 = ¨(                      )Pt Ntj
                                        Qt (1 + ½t+1 )St+1

where ¨ is a real valued function such that ¨(1) = 1; and ¨0 (x) > 0 at least
for values of x close to one. Aggregating over j one thus obtains
                           Qt Kt+1            Rt+1 St
                                   = ¨(                    )                              (83)
                            Pt Nt       Qt (1 + ½t+1 )St+1

    Under perfect foresight, 14 and 16 now follow immediately from 4 and
83; in particular, the function F is given by the inverse of ¨: If Rt+1 =St+1
is uncertain as of the time of contracting, BGG show that Rt+1 =St+1 can
be replaced by t (Rt+1 =St+1 ), at least in the case in which borrowers assume
aggregate risk.
    Two additional details deserve comment. First, it is only a matter of
accounting to show that the economy’s net worth in any period t must equal
aggregate capital income minus foreign debt repayment, as given by equation
17 in the text. Second, our assumption in the text is that entrepreneurs
consume a fraction (1 ¡ ±) of their net worth and reinvest the rest. This can

                                            34
be derived from more primitive assumptions; for instance, one can assume
that an individual entrepreneur j “dies” in period t+1 with probability (1¡±),
and that surviving entrepreneurs are patient enough so that they choose not
to consume their wealth until death.9

8.2     Solving for the Saddlepath
Here we justify some of the assertions
                                ³     ´ in subsection 3.3. The de…nition of the
matrix © implies that Tr(©) = ¸ (1 + ¹)+2 > 1, and Det(©) = ¸¡1 > 1.
                                  1¡¸

Since the determinant, which is equal to the product of the roots of ©, is
larger than 1, it follows that both roots cannot be below 1. If ³ i , i = 1; 2,
are the roots of ©, then
                    ³         ´                   rh³           ´                 i2
                        1¡¸
                         ¸
                                  (1 + ¹) + 2 §           1¡¸
                                                           ¸
                                                                    (1 + ¹) + 2        ¡ 4¸¡1
             ³i =                                                         (84)
                                          2
If one root is smaller than one, it has to be the smaller root. This requires
       Ã       !                        v"Ã   !                             #2
                                        u
           1¡¸                          u 1¡¸
                                        t
               (1 + ¹) + 2 ¡                                  (1 + ¹) + 2        ¡ 4¸¡1 < 2       (85)
            ¸                                     ¸

which, a little algebra reveals, is always the case, regardless of the size of ¹.
We conclude that the system displays saddle path stability.
   Now the computation of the saddle path equation is a standard exercise,
which yields
                                                      2
            ¯ = ¡³            ´               rh³         ´                 i2               <0   (86)
                        1¡¸                         1¡¸                                 ¡1

                                                              (1 + ¹) + 2        ¡ 4¸

     To keep the number of entrepreneurs constant, one can assume that each dead entre-
preneur is replaced by a newborn one. A minor problem arises since new entrepreneurs
must have some initial net worth to be able to borrow. This can be remedied by assuming
that new entrepreneurs are born with an exogenous and arbitrarily small endowment, or
that they have a small endowment of labor (as in Carlstrom and Fuerst 1998). The e¤ects
of either assumption would be negligible, and so we ignore this issue in the text.
