ABSTRACT
Although policymakers often discuss tradeoffs between bank competition and stability, past
research provides differing theoretical perspectives and empirical results on the impact of
competition on risk. In this paper, we employ a new approach for identifying exogenous changes
in the competitive pressures facing individual banks and discover that an intensification of
competition materially boosts bank risk. With respect to the mechanisms, we find that
competition reduces bank profits, charter values, and relationship lending and increases banks’
provision of nontraditional banking services.

Many policymakers seem to think that some curbs on competition
may be a price worth paying to improve stability.
(The Economist, 2009)
1. INTRODUCTION
Since 2008, policymakers have reoriented their focus toward financial
stability, often expressing willingness to trade-off competition and efficiency
for stability. For example, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Tarullo (2012)
explains that the primary aim of the Dodd-Frank Act is to contain systemic
risk, even if this reduces the competitiveness and efficiency of banks. The
Bank of England (2015) notes that its new, primary responsibility is to foster
financial stability, while other considerations are secondary goals.
But, is there a trade-off? Extensive research establishes both the
economic costs of bank failures (e.g., Friedman and Schwartz 1963, Bernanke
1983, Ashcraft 2005, Schularick and Taylor 2012, and Chodorow-Reich 2014)
and the economic benefits of competitive, efficient banking systems (e.g.,
King and Levine 1993, Jayaratne and Strahan 1996, Levine and Zervos 1998,
and Rajan and Zingales 1998). So, if there is a tradeoff between competition
and stability, research highlights the economic importance of finding the
optimal balance between the two. But, research has not resolved whether such
a trade-off exists. In this paper, we employ a new approach for identifying
exogenous changes in the competitive pressures facing individual banks to
assess the impact of competition on bank risk. In this way, we contribute both
to policy deliberations and research debates.
Economic theory offers differing perspectives on whether competition
increases or decreases bank risk. The competition-fragility view explains that
an intensification of competition can reduce bank profit margins and charter
values, encouraging banks to increase the riskiness of their loan portfolios and
to provide nontraditional products and services (e.g., Keeley 1990, Hellman,
Murdoch, and Stiglitz 2000, and Stiroh 2004). Related research explains that
competition can curtail the ability of banks to earn information rents from

2

relationship lending, reducing their incentives to screen and monitor
borrowers with adverse effects on bank stability (e.g., Allen and Gale 2000,
Berger et al. 2005, and Dell’Ariccia and Marquez 2006). In contrast, the
competition-stability view argues that competition reduces risk. Boyd and De
Nicoló (2005) show that even when an intensification of competition lowers
bank profits and charter values, this also tends to reduce interest rates charged
on loans. In turn, these lower rates can attract lower-risk borrowers by
reducing adverse selection and lessen risk shifting by reducing moral hazard.
Furthermore, competition can make banks more comparable and transparent
(Stiglitz and Nalebuff 1983), facilitating the monitoring and curtailment of
bank risk. 1
Existing empirical work also offers conflicting findings on the
competition-risk nexus, arguably reflecting challenges to measuring
exogenous sources of variation in competition. Researchers have used three
broad categories of proxies for competition. First, many researchers use bank
concentration measures, with some studies finding a positive and others a
negative relation with risk depending on the precise concentration and risk
measures as summarized in Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2006).
Concentration, however, does not measure the contestability of banking
markets. Indeed, Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) show that the removal of
regulatory impediments to bank competition increased bank concentration.
Second, researchers estimate the responsiveness of prices to costs and use this
as a proxy for competition (e.g., Schaeck, Čihák, and Wolfe 2009 and Anginer,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Zhu 2014). These price-cost measures, however, require
both nontrivial assumptions on banks’ costs and data that are unavailable for
most banks. Besides the measurement problems, identification challenges
plague both of these proxies since banking sector stability might influence
1

Using cross-country comparisons, Ranciere, Tornell, and Westermann (2008) find that
countries that experience occasional financial crises grow, on average, faster than countries
with stable financial conditions, suggesting that there is not always a trade-off between risk
and efficiency.

3

bank competition and the price-cost indicators and some third factor might
drive bank risk and these competition proxies.
A third category of bank competition proxies, and the one to which we
contribute, measures regulation-induced changes in the contestability of
banking markets and addresses some of the weaknesses with the other two
competition measures (e.g., Jayaratne and Strahan 1998 and Dick 2006). In
particular, for most of the 20th century, U.S. states prohibited banks from other
states from establishing subsidiaries within their borders. During the 1980s
and 1990s, individual states started removing these restrictions in different
years, allowing banks from other states to enter and compete with local banks.
These regulatory changes boosted the contestability of banking markets.
While Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) find that deregulation reduced
non-performing loans, suggesting a reduction in bank risk, there are concerns
with using these state-year deregulation measures to identify the impact of
contestability on bank risk: An omitted state characteristic could drive both the
timing of deregulation and bank risk. 2
To better identify the impact of bank competition on risk, we construct
measures of the regulation-induced competitive pressures facing individual
bank holding companies (BHCs) in the United States. Following Jiang, Levine,
and Lin (2016), we construct these new competition measures by adding two
features to the regulatory-induced competition measures used in earlier studies.
First, past studies code a state as prohibiting or permitting interstate banking,
and use the first year that a state deregulates with any other state as when it
moves from a prohibiting to a permitting regulatory state. However, as
emphasized by Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013, 2016), not only did
individual states begin interstate deregulation in different years, they followed
different dynamic paths. Individual states made unilateral, bilateral, and
2

In a cross-country study, Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2004) find that economies with bank
regulatory systems that impose stronger barriers to entry by new domestic or foreign banks
are more likely to suffer systemic banking crises than countries with less protective systems.
However, this cross-country approach also has serious identification challenges.

4

multilateral agreements with other states in a process that evolved in a fairly
chaotic manner from 1982 until the Riegle-Neal Act eliminated restrictions on
interstate banking in 1995. Thus, for each state and each year, we measure
which “foreign” state’s BHCs can establish subsidiaries in its borders. Our
procedure yields state-year measures of the competitive pressures facing a
state’s banking system and these measures have richer dynamics than previous
studies of competition and stability.
The second step in constructing a time-varying, BHC-specific
competition measure involves integrating these state-year interstate bank
deregulation measure with the “gravity model” of investment to differentiate
among BHCs within a state. The gravity model assumes that the cost of
establishing a subsidiary is inversely related to the geographic distance
between the BHC’s headquarters and the new subsidiary. Consistent with this
assumption, Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2013, 2016) show that BHCs are
more likely to expand into geographically close markets. The gravity model,
therefore, predicts that a BHC b headquartered in state k will experience a
greater intensification of competition from BHCs in state j if BHC b is
geographically closer to state j because it is less costly for state j’s BHCs to
establish subsidiaries closer to BHC b within state k. That is, when California
relaxes interstate banking restrictions with Arizona, BHCs in southern
California will experience a sharper increase in competition than BHCs in
northern California. Using this insight, we (a) identify for each bank
subsidiary in each year those states whose BHCs can enter the subsidiary’s
state, (b) weight each of those states by the inverse distance to the subsidiary
to calculate the competitive environment facing each subsidiary in each period,
and (c) calculate the competitive pressures facing each BHC by weighting
these subsidiary-level competition measures by the percentage of each
subsidiary’s assets in the BHC. We create additional competition measures by
further weighting the inverse distance between each subsidiary i in state j and
the states (k) whose banks can enter state j by the Gross State Product (GSP)

5

or the number of BHCs in those k-states.
These BHC-time competition measures have several appealing
features. They measure the contestability of markets, and therefore avoid the
complications associated with inferring competition from market structure or
price-cost indicators. Furthermore, BHC-time competition measures are built
on two plausibly exogenous sources of variation: the geographic distance
between banks and other states and the quasi-experimental dynamic process of
interstate bank deregulation. Finally, by integrating the process of interstate
bank deregulation with the gravity model, the resultant time-varying,
BHC-specific measures differentiate among BHCs within the same state and
year. This allows us to control for state-year fixed effects, reducing the
possibility that omitted variables that vary simultaneously with interstate bank
deregulation drive the results.
We also contribute to the competition-risk literature by using
market-based rather than accounting-based measures of risk. For example,
several authors use risk measures based on nonperforming loans, loan loss
provision, loan charge-offs, or profit volatility (e.g., Keeley 1990, Jayaratne
and Strahan 1998, and Dick 2006) and others use the Z-score to gauge a
bank’s distance to insolvency (e.g., Laeven and Levine 2009, and Houston et
al. 2010). These accounting based measures, however, are subject to
manipulation and may not be consistent across regulatory jurisdictions or over
time due to changes in accounting rules. Indeed, Jiang, Levine, and Lin (2016)
show that competition reduces the degree to which BHCs manipulate
accounting and financial statements.
We use seven market-based measures of individual bank risk and two
measures of a BHC’s contribution to systemic risk. We focus on two measures:
Total Risk measures stock return volatility and equals the natural logarithm of
the standard deviation of daily stock returns, and Tail Risk measures a BHC’s
expected loss during “bad times,” i.e., during the 5% worst return days in a
year as in Ellul and Yerramilli (2013). We also use three risk measures based

6

on the residuals from asset pricing models. Specifically, Residual Risk-CAPM
equals the natural logarithm of the standard deviation of the residuals from the
one-factor capital asset pricing model. Residual Risk-Fama French and
Residual Risk-GG are similarly defined based on the residuals from the Fama
French three-factor model and the augmented CAPM that includes
information on bond default spreads and interest rates. Furthermore, we use
Merton’s (1974) option pricing model to estimate the volatility of each BHC’s
stock price in each year and call this the Implied Asset Volatility measure of
bank risk (Berger, Klapper, and Turk-Ariss 2009). Seventh, from Berg and
Gider (2016), we construct an unlevered equity volatility measure, Asset Risk,
that equals Total Risk divided by the BHC’s book leverage. With respect to
measuring a BHC’s contribution to systemic risk, Systemic Risk-MES is the
Acharya et al. (2017) measure of the degree to which a BHC’s valuation falls
during the aggregate market’s worst trading days in a year and Systemic
Risk-∆CoVaR is the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) measure of the degree to
which an individual institution’s risk contributes to the risk of the entire state’s
financial system and equals the change in the value at risk of the entire
financial system conditional on the single institution being under distress
relative to its median state. Although the focus of our study is on assessing the
impact of competition on risk at the individual BHC level, we use these
Systemic Risk measures to check whether a BHC’s exposure to competition
affects its contribution to systemic risk.
We use panel regressions in which the dependent variable is one of the
bank risk measures and the main explanatory variable is one of the
time-varying, BHC-specific competition measures. The regressions control for
state-year and BHC fixed effects. The state-year effects control for all
time-varying state characteristics, including economic output, the volatility of
output, and state-level policies and bank regulatory reforms. The BHC fixed
effects condition away all time-invariant bank characteristics. We also control
for time-varying, BHC-specific characteristics, such as size, the ratios of

7

deposits to assets, loans to assets, and capital to assets.
We discover that an intensification of bank competition materially
boosts bank risk, suggesting an economically large trade-off between
competition and risk. Each of the BHC competition measures enters positively
and significantly across all of the different bank risk measures. The results
hold when including state-year and BHC fixed effects. Furthermore, the
results are robust to (a) including or excluding, time-varying BHC traits or (b)
altering the sample period. The effects are economically large. For example,
consider a BHC when its regulation-induced competition level is “low,” i.e., at
the 25th percentile of sample distribution, and the same BHC when
competition is “high,” at the 75th percentile of the distribution. The estimated
coefficients suggest that Total Risk and Tail Risk would each rise by about
50%. The estimated impacts of competition on the other bank risk measures
are also large. Taken together, the empirical findings suggest that bank
competition exerts a statistically and economically significant impact on bank
risk taking.
We also explore potential mechanisms linking bank competition and
risk. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine all possible
channels through which competition might shape bank risk, we explore three
suggested by the research discussed above. First, the competition-fragility
view stresses that competition squeezes bank charter values and profits, which
in turn induces banks to take actions that boost risk (e.g. Keeley 1990 and
Hellman, Murdoch, and Stiglitz 2000). Second, as competition squeezes profit
margins on traditional lending services, banks might seek to generate income
through new lines of noninterest generating activities that boost bank risk (e.g.,
DeYoung and Roland 2001 and Stiroh 2004). Third, by making it easier for
borrowers to switch banks, competition might impede banks from earning
information rents (e.g., Boot and Greenbaum 1993, Berger and Udell 1995,
Berger et al. 2005, and Dell’Ariccia and Marquez 2006). Since relationship
lending means that banks have invested in acquiring information on borrowers,

8

a reduction in relationship lending could boost bank risk as banks make less
informed loans to new clients. Thus, we evaluate the impact of
regulation-induced competition on bank charter values and profits, the
proportion of a BHC’s income contributed by noninterest generating sources,
and the degree to which banks lend to new customers.
Consistent with these views of how competition shapes bank risk, we
find that an intensification of competition (1) reduced bank charter values and
profitability, (2) increased the proportion of income that BHCs obtain through
noninterest generating activities, and (3) boosted the likelihood that BHCs
lend to new customers. These findings provide evidence on the mechanisms
through competition can influence bank risk. These findings also reduce
concerns

that

some

confounding

factor

drives

the

finding

that

regulation-induced competition increases risk, as this confounding factor
would also have to account for the findings on these three mechanisms.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes data
and the construction of key variables. Section 3 explains the empirical
methodology, while Section 4 reports our findings. Section 5 explores
mechanism tests and Section 6 concludes.
2. DATA
This section describes the sample of banks, nine measures of bank risk,
and three measures of the time-varying competitive pressures facing each
BHC. We define the other key bank-level variables while presenting the
results. Table 1 provides detailed definitions of all variables and Table 2
presents summary statistics.
2.1 Sample of Banks
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago provides Condition and Income
statements for all consolidated BHCs on a quarterly basis since June 1986.
Since our core analyses use annual data, we start in 1987. We match these data

9

with CRSP/Compustat using the CRSP-FRB Link provided by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York to obtain stock price information on BHCs. We
restrict the sample to banks located in the United States, which removes BHCs
chartered in Puerto Rico. There are 513 BHCs with daily stock price data.
Next, we (a) only include the ultimate parent BHC that owns, but is not owned
by, other financial institutions, where ownership is defined as holding 50% or
more of outstanding shares and (b) eliminate BHCs that cannot be matched
with their subsidiaries using Call Report data provided by The Federal
Reserve. This yields 486 BHCs. Finally, we follow the literature and drop
Delaware and South Dakota because they have special laws to encourage the
entry of credit card banking. After dropping missing values, the final sample
includes 2,634 BHC-year observations on 446 BHCs during the period from
1987 to 1995.
2.2 Risk-taking Measures
We use nine market-based measures of risk. We use market-based
measures of risk, rather than accounting-based measures such as capital-asset
ratios, loan charge-offs, loan loss provisions, and Z-scores, for two reasons.
First, banks sometimes manipulate accounting statements, and we do not want
to confound the impact of competition on bank risk with its impact on the
manipulation of accounting statements. Second, it typically takes several years
for a change in bank’s environment to shape its loan charge-offs, loan loss
provisions, and other accounting-based indicators of risk, and this makes it
complicated to match the timing of a change in competition to bank risk. Since
asset prices reflect the expected present value of changes in the competitive
environment, market-based risk measures are likely to be less subject to
manipulation and less prone to lags that complicate the analyses.
Total Risk measures the volatility of stock returns and equals the
natural logarithm of the standard deviation of a bank’s daily stock returns.
Throughout the analyses, we annualize all daily returns. Many banking studies

10

use stock return volatility, including Brickley and James (1986), Houston and
James (1995), and Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2016), but not in assessing the
impact of competition on bank risk.
Tail Risk measures a BHC’s expected loss during bad times. Following
Ellul and Yerramilli (2013), Tail Risk equals the natural logarithm of the
negative of the average return on a BHC’s stock over the 5% worst return days
for the BHC’s stock in a year.
We use three measures of Residual Risk that gauge the BHC’s
nondiversifiable risk and equal the natural logarithm of the standard deviation
of the residuals from three different asset pricing models. Specifically,
Residual Risk-CAPM is based on residuals obtained from the standard Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) equation,
𝑟𝑏𝑏 = 𝑟𝑓𝑓 + 𝛽1 (𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 )𝑡 + ε𝑡 ,

(1)

where 𝑟𝑏𝑏 measures the daily stock return of BHC b in time t, 𝑟𝑓𝑓 represents

risk-free rate in period t, and 𝑟𝑚 is the daily market return. 3 Residual-Fama

French is based on the residuals from the Fama-French three-factor model,
where the size factor (SMB) and the market-to-book factor (HML) are added to
the standard CAPM equation, 4 so that
𝑟𝑏𝑏 = 𝑟𝑓𝑓 + 𝛽1 �𝑟𝑚𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓𝑓 � + 𝛽2 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑡 + ε𝑡 .

(2)

Residual GG is based on the augmented CAPM used in the banking
studies by Gatev, Schuermann, and Strahan (2009) and Goetz, Laeven, and
Levine (2016), where
3

The results are robust to using the Dismon (1979) adjustment for non-synchronous trading,
which involves adding five leads and five lags of market returns into the market model, i.e.
𝑟𝑏𝑏 = 𝑟𝑓𝑓 + 𝛽1 (𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 )𝑡 + ∑5𝑑=1 𝜌𝑛 (𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 )𝑡+𝑑 + ∑5𝑑=1 𝛿𝑑 (𝑟𝑚 − 𝑟𝑓 )𝑡−𝑑 + ε𝑡 .
4
To be more specific, SMB stands for “small minus big” and equals the average return on
three portfolios of small firm stocks (i.e., 1/3*(small value + small neutral + small growth))
minus the average return on three portfolios of large firm stocks (i.e., 1/3 * (big value + big
neutral + big growth)). HML stands for “high minus low” and is often called the value
premium. It equals the average return of two value portfolios (i.e. 1/2*(small value + big
value)) minus the average return of the two growth portfolios (i.e. 1/2*(small growth + big
growth)).

11

𝑟𝑏𝑏 = α + 𝛽1 ∙ 𝑟𝑚𝑚 + 𝛽2 ∙ ∆(𝐵𝐵𝐵 − 𝐴𝐴𝐴)𝑡

+𝛽3 ∙ ∆(3 − 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ 𝑇 − 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵)𝑡 + ε𝑡 ,

(3)

and where ∆(𝐵𝐵𝐵 − 𝐴𝐴𝐴) is a default risk factor that representing the change

in the yield on Baa-rated vs. Aaa-rated corporate bonds, and ∆(3 −

𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ 𝑇 − 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵) is the change in yield on 3-month treasury bills representing
an interest rate factor. As shown below, we obtain consistent results when

using any of these asset-pricing models to obtain measures of idiosyncratic

risk.
Implied Asset Volatility provides an options-based measure of BHC
risk and equals the natural logarithm of the standard deviation of the asset
return implicit in Merton’s (1974) option pricing model. Specifically, we
estimate the volatility of asset returns by solving the following
Black-Scholes-Merton equation:
𝐸 = V ∙ 𝑁(𝑑1 ) − 𝑒 −𝛾𝛾 ∙ 𝐷 ∙ 𝑁(𝑑2 ),

(4)

where E is the market value of the bank’s equity, V is the asset value of the
bank, D is the face value of bank’s debt (equal to current liabilities plus
one-half of long-term debt), r is the risk-free rate, and 𝑁(∙) is the cumulative

standard normal distribution function. 𝑑1 and 𝑑2 are given by:
and

𝑑1 =

𝑉
𝐹

ln� �+�𝑟+0.5𝜎𝑣2 �𝑇
𝜎𝑣 ∙√𝑇

,

𝑑2 = 𝑑1 − 𝜎𝑣 √𝑇,

(5)

(6)

where 𝜎𝑣 is the volatility of bank asset. The Merton model also assumes that

the bank has issued just one discount bond maturing in T periods.

Asset Risk is the natural logarithm of the standard deviation of daily

stock returns over the year divided by book leverage, where book leverage
equals one minus the book value of equity divided by total assets. Berg and
Gider (2016) propose this as a measure of unlevered equity volatility and we
use it to assess the robustness of our findings.

12

For the eighth and ninth measures, we use two measures of systemic
risk: Systemic Risk-MES and Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR. To construct Systemic
Risk-MES, we start with the marginal expected shortfall (MES), which was
developed by Acharya et al. (2017) as one important component to gauge a
BHC’s systemic risk. The MES equals the average return on a BHC’s stock
price multiplied by its market capitalization during the aggregate market’s 5%
worst trading days in a year. MES measures the degree to which the BHC’s
value moves closely with the aggregate market during its worst days. The
intuition underlying the MES measure of systemic risk is that a bank is more
systemically risky if its market value falls when the overall stock market is
especially weak. To obtain Systemic Risk-MES, we multiply the MES by
negative one so that greater values of MES correspond to greater systemic risk,
which means that when the market return is low, the individual bank’s returns
will be low as well. 5
Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR is from Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) and
measures the degree to which an individual institution contributes to the risk of the
entire financial system. It equals the change of CoVaR conditional on a single
institution being under distress relative to its median state, where CoVaR, or
“conditional VaR” is defined as the value at risk of the entire financial system (VaR)
conditional on a single financial institution being in a particular state. Thus, there is a
separate value for Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR for each bank in each period as the change

in the VaR for the entire financial system differs by bank and over time. As with
common measures of the VaR of an individual financial institution, Systemic
Risk-∆CoVaR is computed for a particular “distress” level, and we use the 95%

quantile of the worst weekly stock returns. 6

5

Note that we take the natural logarithm of all the risk measures except for the Systemic Risk,
because a BHC’s average return during the market-worst-return-days can be both positive and
negative.
6
Calomiris and Mason (1997, 2003) examine the connections between individual bank and
systemic banking sector risk. We simply evaluate whether an intensification of competition
has similar effects on both individual bank risk and the bank’s contribution to systemic risk.

2.3 BHC-specific Competition Measures: Overview
To create measures of the time-varying competitive pressures facing
each BHC, we integrate two sources of variation in competition: the
time-varying, state-specific process of interstate bank deregulation and the
gravity model of investment, which differentiates among BHCs within each
state. We begin with an overview and then provide a detailed explanation of
the construction of the competition measures.
First, we exploit the staggered removal of regulatory restrictions on
interstate banking. For most of the 20th century, states prohibited interstate
banking, i.e., each state prohibited banks from other states from establishing
bank subsidiaries (or branches) within its geographic borders. Starting in 1982,
individual states begin a chaotic process of removing these restrictions. 7
States both started interstate bank deregulation in different years and followed
different paths of deregulation over time. Specifically, some states unilaterally
opened their borders to out-of-state banks, while others signed a series of
bilateral and multilateral reciprocal agreements with other states over time.
For example, Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of interstate bank deregulation
for California. It displays the year when California permitted BHCs located in
every other state to enter California. As shown, California started interstate
banking in 1987 by allowing banks in Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, Texas, Utah,
and Washington to enter. 8 This was followed by Idaho in 1988, Nevada and
New Mexico in 1989, and so forth. Similarly, Figure 2 illustrates the evolution
of interstate bank deregulation for the state of New York. New York started
interstate banking in 1982 by allowing Alaska, Maine, and Missouri to enter,
followed by Arizona and Kentucky in 1986, and Oklahoma, Texas, Utah,
7

More specifically, Maine passed legislation permitting out-of-state acquisitions on a
national reciprocal basis, i.e., Maine allowed a “foreign” state’s banks to buy Maine banks if
that foreign state allowed Maine’s banks to buy its banks. Since no states reciprocated until
1982, this deregulation process was in fact stalled until 1982, when Alaska and New York
passed laws similar to Maine’s.
8
Although California offered regional reciprocal agreements to Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho,
Nevada, and New Mexico in 1987, these states did not sign reciprocal agreement with
California, so banks from these states were not allowed to enter California in 1987.

14

Washington, and Wyoming in 1987, and so on. These two figures illustrate the
more general point: different states started the process of interstate bank
deregulation in different years and followed different patterns until
prohibitions on interstate banking were effectively ended across the United
States in 1995 by the Riegle-Neal Act.
Thus, we use information on the evolution of each state’s exposure to
competition from banks headquartered in other states. In particular, when state
j’s regulators permit the entry of BHCs headquartered in other states, this
intensifies the contestability of state j’s banking sector. Since state j
deregulates with different states over time, we construct a measure of
competitive pressures facing state j in each year. It is worth noting that our
measure of regulation-induced competition is different from the traditional
measures of interstate bank deregulation. Researchers typically use the first
year that a state allowed banks from any other state to enter its borders and
establish subsidiaries (either through an acquisition or de novo) as the
“treatment.” This traditional, discrete indicator of interstate bank deregulation
equals zero in the years before the state first allowed out-of-state banks to
enter and one afterwards. We, however, examine the year-by-year,
state-specific process of the removal of regulatory restrictions on interstate
banking. Although this is an improvement over traditional measures, this
dynamic interstate bank deregulation measure does not differentiate among
BHCs within a state and year.
Second, we exploit the gravity model to construct a time-varying, BHC
specific measure of competition. The gravity model predicts that the costs to a
BHC of establishing a subsidiary in a location are inversely related to the
distance between the BHC’s headquarters and the location. This allows us to
differentiate among BHCs within a state, as each BHC has a different distance
to other states and hence faces different competition from BHCs in those
states. By integrating the state-time process of interstate bank deregulation
with the gravity model’s differentiation across banks in the same state, we

construct time-varying measures of “regulatory-induced competitive pressures”
facing each BHC.
2.4 BHC-specific Competition Measures: Details
More specifically, we construct the BHC-specific competition
measures as follows. First, for each year t, (a) identify all states (k’s) whose
BHCs are allowed to establish subsidiaries in state j and set Ijkt equal to one if
banks from state k can enter state j in period t and zero otherwise and (b) set
DISik equal to the natural logarithm of the distance between bank subsidiary i
within state j and state k’s capital city. 9
Second, for each subsidiary i, in state j, in each year t, calculate its
exposure to regulation-induced competition from state k as follows:
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑘

𝐼𝑗𝑗𝑗

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

.

(7)

Third, calculate the regulation-induced competition facing each BHC b
in state s and year t (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑏𝑏𝑏 ). We do this by
aggregating the regulation-induced competition pressures facing each of the

BHC’s subsidiaries. In performing this aggregation, we weight each subsidiary
i within BHC b in year t by the proportion of i’s assets in the BHC (Pibt) in

year t. Thus,
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑏𝑏𝑏 =

𝐿𝐿 ∑𝑖∈𝑏[𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡) 𝑖𝑖 ] ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,

(8)

We take the natural logarithm of the sum of the weighted distance measure to
improve the interpretability of the coefficient estimates. Note that the state in
which subsidiary i is physically located might differ from the state where the
headquarters of the BHC of which subsidiary i is a component is located.
Based on this procedure, we construct two additional measures of each
BHC’s exposure to regulation-induced competitive pressures in each year.
9

We measure the distance from bank i to the capital city of every other state k by computing
the road distance in miles between two zip codes using Google maps api.

16

First, we further weight the regulation-induced competition measure specified
in equation (7) by the number of BHCs in state k in year t (𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑘𝑘 ), so that
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 # 𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 =
= ∑𝑘

𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑘𝑘 ∗𝐼𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

(9)

.

This implies the following competition measure at the BHC level:
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 # 𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑏𝑏𝑏 =

= ∑𝑖∈𝑏[𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 #𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡) 𝑖𝑖 ] ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

(10)

For the second additional measure, we follow a similar procedure and weight
the regulation-induced competition measure specified in equation (7) by the
economic size of state k, i.e., by the gross state product of state k in year t
(GSPkt) and create 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑏𝑏𝑏 . 10
3. EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
To examine the impact of competition on bank risk, we primarily use a
panel regression in which the unit of analysis is a BHC-year observation and
where we control for both state-year (𝜃𝑠𝑠 ) and BHC (𝜃𝑏 ) fixed effects. The

state-year fixed effects control for all time-varying state influences. The BHC
fixed effects condition out all time-invariant BHC characteristics. In particular,
we estimate the following ordinary least squares equation:
𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑏𝑏𝑏 ) = 𝛽 ∙ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 𝛾 ′ ∙ 𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 𝜃𝑏 + 𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝑏𝑏𝑏 , (11)

where 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑏𝑏𝑏 is the one of the nine measures of risk for BHC b,

headquartered in state s in year t (i.e., Total Risk, Tail Risk, Residual
Risk-CAPM, Residual Risk-Fama French, Residual Risk-GG, Implied Asset
10

That is, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑘

that the corresponding competition measure at the BHC level is:

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ∗𝐼𝑗𝑗𝑗
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖

, so

𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡)𝑏𝑏𝑏 =
∑𝑖∈𝑏[𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 (𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑡) 𝑖𝑖 ] ∗ 𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

Volatility, Asset Risk, Systemic Risk-MES, and Systemic Risk- ∆ CoVaR).
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑏𝑏𝑏 is one of the three measures of the competitive pressures

facing each BHC b in state s in year t (i.e., Competition (Distance Weighted),
Competition (Distance and # of BHCs Weighted), and Competition (Distance
and GSP Weighted)). 𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏 represents a vector of time-varying BHC traits:

Log(Total Assets) is the natural logarithm of the BHC’s total assets, Deposits
To Assets is the ratio of bank deposits to total assets, Loans To Assets is the
ratio of bank loans to total assets, and Capital To Asset is the BHC’s
capital-asset ratio. 11 In seeking to assess the impact of an intensification of
competition on bank risk, we focus on estimating β. We report
heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors that are clustered at the state
level. 12
Our econometric strategy mitigates the concern that bank risk
influences the timing of when states remove restrictions on interstate banking.
For example, if heightened bank risk within a state induces state officials to
lower barriers to the entry of out-of-state banks to improve lending quality,
this could confound the ability to identify the impact of competition on bank
risk. However, we use a time-varying, BHC-specific measure of competition
that differentiates among banks within the same state and year, so that we can
control for state-year fixed effects. This reduces the possibility that
time-varying, statewide factors impede our ability to assess the differential
effects of competition on individual bank risk within a state.
Even with this strategy, it is valuable to note that lagged values of bank
risk do not predict the timing of interstate regulatory reforms, as shown in
Table 3. For each state, we aggregate the Total Risk and Tail Risk of individual
11

In our sample, the average BHC has $6.9 billion of assets (Total Assets), while the median
BHC has $1.1 billion in total assets. Due to the skewed distribution of assets, we use the
natural logarithm of total assets in the regression analyses. Furthermore, in the regressions, we
use lagged values of these bank-specific measures. However, all of the results hold when
measuring them contemporaneously.
12
The results hold when clustering the errors at either the state-year level or the state and year
levels.

18

BHCs headquartered in that state and calculate the n-year average of Total
Risk and Tail Risk at the state level, where n represents one to three years prior
to the interstate deregulation. The dependent variable is either (a) the
state-year dummy variable, Deregulation, that equals one in period t for state s
if state s started interstate deregulation by year t, or (b) the state-year variable
Num_of_States that equals the natural logarithm of one plus the number of
states, who’s BHCs are allowed to enter state s in year t. We also control for
the series of state characteristics used by Kroszner and Strahan (1999) in their
assessment of the timing of interstate bank deregulation. These controls
include per capita gross state product (GSP), state unemployment rate, an
indicator for unit banking law, small firm share in the state, small bank share
in the state, capital ratio of small banks relative to large banks, relative size of
insurance in states where banks can sell insurance, relative size of insurance in
states where banks cannot sell insurance, an indicator for one party control in
the state, and share of state government controlled by Democrats.
Table 3 shows that bank risk does not predict the timing of regulatory
reforms. For Total Risk, columns (1) – (3) provide the results for Deregulation,
while columns (4) – (6) provide them for Num_of_States. Similarly, for Tail
Risk, columns (7) – (9) give the regression estimates for Deregulation, while
the results on Num_of_States are provided in columns (10) – (12). As evinced
by the insignificant coefficients on all of the lagged risk measures, there is no
indication that bank risk predicts the timing of interstate bank deregulation.
4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
The results reported in Table 4 indicate that the regulation-induced
intensification of competition increased bank risk. Table 4 reports estimates of
equation (11), where the dependent variable is Total Risk in columns (1) – (5)
and Tail Risk in columns (6) – (10). For each of these two bank risk measures,
we report regression results with the three BHC-specific competition measures
- Competition (Distance Weighted), Competition (Distance Weighted and # of

19

Banks Weighted), and Competition (Distance Weighted and GSP Weighted). In
all cases (columns 1–3 and 6–8), each of these three BHC-specific
competition measures enters positively and significantly at the one percent
significance level. Furthermore, with respect to the BHC-level control
variables, banks with higher Capital To Asset ratios tend to have lower risk.
This is in accordance with the capital buffer theory that bank capital can
absorb adverse shocks, reducing risk. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that
these results hold when excluding the time-varying BHC traits from the
analyses. Although including endogenous BHC-level controls could
contaminate the analyses. Appendix Table 1 shows that the estimated
coefficients on the competition measures, and their statistical significance, do
not change much when excluding these regressors. 13
The estimated coefficients in Table 4 suggest that the economic impact
of competition on bank risk is large. For example, consider the estimates
reported in column (1), where the dependent variable is Total Risk, the
competition measure is Competition (Distance Weighted), and the estimated
coefficient on competition is 0.59. Furthermore, consider a BHC when its
regulation-induced competition level (Competition (Distance Weighted)) is
low, i.e., at the 25th percentile of distribution for the entire sample, and the
same BHC when competition level is high, i.e., at the 75th percentile. This
involves an intensification of regulation-induced competition of 0.82. The
column (1) estimates suggest that the BHCs’ Total Risk would be 48% greater
in the high competition environment. The estimated impact is similar when
considering the estimates on Tail Risk from column (4).
In Table 4, we also highlight the importance of our identification
strategy. As emphasized above, our three BHC-specific proxies of
competition—Competition (Distance Weighted), Competition (Distance
Weighted and # of BHC Weighted), and Competition (Distance Weighted and
GSP Weighted)—differ across BHCs within the same state and year. This
13

We also conducted our analyses at the quarterly level. All of the results hold.

20

allows us to control for state-year fixed effects and eliminate concerns that an
omitted state-year variable drives the results, i.e., we are identifying the
impact of competition on bank risk by comparing BHCs within the same state
and year. To assess the importance of this strategy, we examine two traditional
proxies of competition that do not allow us to control for state-year effects. In
particular, we examine Deregulation, which for state j in year t is a dummy
variable that equals one if the state allows BHCs from at least one other state
to enter and establish subsidiaries within its borders and zero otherwise, and
Bank Concentration, which for state s in year t equals the summation of the
squared share of each BHC’s assets headquartered in state s in year t. Neither
Deregulation nor Bank Concentration differs across BHCs within a state and
year, so we cannot include state-year fixed effects to reduce concerns of
reverse causality or that omitted state-year factors drive both the risk in state’s
banking market and the state-specific proxies for competition (Deregulation
and Bank Concentration). For example, a change in the overall riskiness of a
state’s economy could shape the riskiness of its banking system, the timing of
interstate bank deregulation, and bank consolidation, confounding the ability
to identify the impact of competition on bank risk. Thus, if the results on these
state-specific proxies for competition differ from those on our BHC-specific
proxies, this would advertise the value of our strategy of using more granular
proxies.
Consistent with our econometric strategy, neither of the state-specific
competition proxies enters significantly in the Total Risk or Tail Risk
regressions, as shown in columns 4-5 and 9-10 of Table 4. In these regressions,
we include BHC fixed effects and year fixed effects, but we cannot include
state-year fixed effects since Deregulation and Bank Concentration do not
differ across states within a year. The differences between the results on the
BHC-specific and state-specific competition proxies advertise the importance
of conditioning out all time-varying state influences to identify the impact of
changes in the competitive pressures facing individual BHCs on their risk

21

taking.
We next extend the analyses by examining seven additional measures
of risk. In the seven columns of Table 5, the dependent variable is one of the
three residual risk measures—Residual Risk – CAPM, Residual Risk – Fama
French, Residual Risk – GG, Implied Asset Volatility, the leverage weighted
standard deviation of stock returns (Asset Risk), or one of the two systemic
risk measures: Systemic Risk-MES or Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR. For each risk
measure, we provide results for the BHC-specific competition proxy,
Competition (Distance Weighted). The results hold when using the other
BHC-specific proxies, Competition (Distance Weighted and # of BHC
Weighted) and Competition (Distance Weighted and GSP Weighted), but not
when using the state-specific proxies.
Table 5 confirms that regulation-induced competition boosts bank risk
across all measures of risk. The results are robust to different measures of
individual bank risk. Furthermore, we find that a regulation-induced
intensification of the competitive pressures facing an individual bank increase
its contribution to the riskiness of the state’s banking market, as measured by
Systemic Risk-MES or Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR.
The estimated impacts of regulation-induced competition on these
alternative risk measures are large and the magnitudes are of similar sizes to
those reported above on Total Risk and Tail Risk. To illustrate the economic
magnitudes, again consider a change in Competition (Distance Weighted) from
the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile of the sample distribution. For
example, the Table 5 results indicate that Residual-Risk CAPM would rise by
44%, Implied Asset Volatility would jump by 85%, Asset Risk would increase
by 48%, and Systemic Risk would rise by roughly one standard deviation,
which equals 0.01 for Systemic Risk-MES and 0.002 for Systemic
Risk- ∆ CoVaR.

Taken

together,

the

estimated

positive

impact

of

deregulation-induced competition on bank risk-taking is not only statistically
significant, but also economically important.

22

We next allay two potential concerns with these analyses. First, there
might be concerns that the results are driven solely by BHCs expanding into
different states and not by regulation-induced competition. In particular, if a
BHC faces a greater threat that other banks can establish subsidiaries close by
due to interstate bank deregulation, it also means that the BHC can expand
into other states. Perhaps, it is BHC expansion, not the intensification of
competition that boosts bank risk. This is unlikely since Goetz, Laeven and
Levine (2016) show that geographic expansion reduces risk, not increase it.
Nonetheless, we test this formally by restricting our sample to banks that do
not engage in mergers and acquisitions during the sample period. As reported
in columns (1) – (6) of Table 6, we continue to find that an intensification of
competition is associated with greater bank risk for the restricted sample of
non-expanders. Second, there might be concerns that the results are driven
only by large banks, which are more likely to expand into other states. Thus,
in columns (7) – (12) of Table 6, we provide the results for the subsample of
small BHCs, which we define as BHCs that have total assets below the sample
median for the entire sample period. As shown, all of the results hold. 14
5. MECHANISMS
In this section, we push the analyses beyond our core question of
whether competition increases or decreases risk and evaluate potential
mechanisms linking bank competition and risk. As described in the
Introduction, theory not only provides differing predictions about the effect of
competition on risk, it also provides perspectives on how competition affects
14

There might also be concerns that by cutting the estimation period in 1995, we are ignoring
the lagged effect of deregulation on the contestability of banking markets or other factors that
shape the relation between competition and risk overtime. For example, Goetz, Laeven, and
Levine(2013) show that it often took BHCs several years before they established subsidiaries
in other states. Thus, even though the Riegle-Neal Act effectively removed regulatory
impediments to interstate banking in 1995, the full effects of this Act on the competitive
pressures faced by individual BHCs may have taken several years to materialize. Thus, we
extended the sample through 2006, which increases the sample from 446 to 837 BHCs. All of
the results hold.

23

bank risk. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine all possible
channels through which competition might shape bank risk, we explore
several proposed mechanisms.
A natural starting point is the relation between competition and bank
charter values and profits. As emphasized in influential research by Keeley
(1990), Hellman, Murdoch, and Stiglitz (2000), and Martinez-Miera and
Repullo (2010), the competition-fragility view holds that an intensification of
competition reduces bank profit margins and charter values, which can in turn
create incentives for banks to increase risk. Thus, we begin by evaluating the
impact of regulation-induced competition on bank charter values and profits.
To measure BHC charter value, we use the natural logarithm of the market to
book value of assets ratio (Charter Value). To measure bank profits, we use
the ratio of net income to total assets (Profitability). We then use these as
dependent variables and employ the same regression specification defined
above.
The results reported in Table 7 indicate that an intensification of
competition is associated with a large reduction in both bank charter values
and profits. For Charter Value (columns (1) – (3)) and Profitability (columns
(4) – (6)), we examine each of the three regulation-induced competition
measures. As shown, each of the competition measures enters the Charter
Value and Profitability regressions with a negative and statistically significant
coefficient. Further, the estimated coefficient is economically large. For
example, again consider a BHC that experiences a change in Competition
(Distance Weighted) from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile of the
sample distribution, which implies an increase in regulation-induced
competition of 0.82. Then, the coefficient estimate from column (1) indicates
that Charter Value would fall by 44%, while the estimate from column (4)
suggests that Profitability would fall by 0.005 (equivalent to half standard
deviation change). These results are consistent with the view that a sharp

24

intensification of bank competition materially lowers BHC charter values and
profits.
Research also suggests two particular actions that banks might take in
response to an intensification of competition that would affect risk. First, as
competition squeezes profit margins on traditional lending services, banks
might seek to generate income through new lines of noninterest generating
activities, such as trading and derivatives, fiduciary services, underwriting,
etc., that boost bank risk (e.g., DeYoung and Roland 2001 and Stiroh 2004).
Second, competition can impede the ability of banks to earn information rents
from making costly investments in relationship lending by making it easier for
customers to switch between lenders (e.g., Boot and Greenbaum 1993, Berger
and Udell 1995, Berger et al. 2005, and Dell’Ariccia and Marquez 2006).
Since relationship lenders can better screen and monitor borrowers,
competition that reduces relationship lending and induces banks to lend to
new customers could increase bank risk. We explore each of these potential
actions.
Thus, we first examine whether regulation-induced competition
increases the proportion of income that BHCs receive from noninterest
generating sources. Specifically, we use two measures of noninterest income
that vary over time. Noninterest Income/Total Income equals the BHC’s ratio
of noninterest income to total income. Noninterest Income/Net Interest Income
equals the BHC’s ratio of noninterest income to net interest income. For both
ratios, noninterest income equals the aggregate of income from noninterest
income from trading assets and liabilities, fiduciary activities, account-based
service charges, and other noninterest income. We then use either Noninterest
Income/Total Income or Noninterest Income/Net Interest Income as the
dependent variables and employ our standard regression specification to
assess whether competition increases the proportion of income that BHCs
receive from noninterest generating sources.

25

As reported in Table 8, an increase in regulation-induced competition
is associated with a material increase in the proportion of a BHC’s noninterest
income. In columns (1) – (3), the dependent variable is Noninterest
Income/Total Income and the columns provide results for the three
competition measures. Correspondingly, in columns (4) – (6), the dependent
variable is Noninterest Income/Net Interest Income. The estimated coefficient
on each of the competition measures is positive and statistically significant,
suggesting that a larger proportion of income is generated from noninterest
sources when competition intensifies. These results in conjunction with those
reported in Tables 4 and 7 are consistent with the competition-fragility view:
Regulation-induced competition squeezes profits margins, reduces charter
values, induces banks to increase their reliance on noninterest income, and
bank risk rises.
Finally, to shed some empirical light on whether competition affects
relationship lending, we evaluate whether competition increases lending to
new clients. To conduct this test, we construct new data on whether each BHC
in each year makes a loan to a new customer and use this as a proxy for a
reduction in the degree to which the BHC engages in relationship lending.
Although lending to new customers is not a direct measure of relationship
lending, one testable implication of the prediction that competition will reduce
relationship lending is that banks will seek out new clients and borrowers will
switch banks.
More specifically, we hand match our BHCs with the lead lenders of
syndicated loans as recorded in Dealscan. 15 Out of the 446 BHCs in our
sample, we identify 154 of them that have served as lead lenders during our
sample period. Our matching process yields 11,439 BHC-loan observations
during the period from 1987 through 1995. The unit of analysis is at the
BHC-loan level, because many lenders make loans to multiple borrowers in

26

one year, and there are sometimes multiple lead lenders on a single syndicated
loan. Based on these data from Dealscan and our matching process, we
construct the variable New Customerb,t, which equals one for BHC b in year t
if the BHC makes a loan to a “new customer,” i.e., a borrower who had not
previously borrowed from the BHC, and zero otherwise.
In Table 9, we estimate the impact of regulation-induced competition
on lending to new customers using both probit and ordinary least squares
(OLS) models. Given the binary distribution of the dependent variable New
Customerb,t, we first use a probit regression model and report the marginal
effects. We then confirm the results using OLS. In both models, we control for
BHC and state-year fixed effects and the same time-varying, BHC-specific
traits as in the earlier analyses. As shown in Table 9, each of the BHC-specific
competition measures enters positively and significantly, suggesting that
exposing a BHC to greater competition sharply increases the likelihood that it
lends to a new customer.

Again consider a BHC that experiences a change in

Competition (Distance Weighted) from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile
of the sample distribution, which implies an increase in regulation-induced
competition of 0.57, the coefficient estimate on Competition (Distance
Weighted) from column (1) (0.21) indicates that the likelihood a BHC lends to
a new customer would increase by 12%. Because some observations may be
automatically dropped due to the lack of within-group variation in the probit
model when including BHC and state-year fixed effects, we therefore use OLS
regressions to confirm the robustness of our results as shown in columns
(4)-(6) of Table 9.
6. CONCLUSIONS
Past

research

provides

differing

theoretical

perspectives

and

conflicting empirical results on whether an intensification of competition
makes banks less stable. The differing findings might reflect the challenges of

27

measuring competition, identifying exogenous sources of variation in the
competitive pressures facing banks, and measuring bank risk.
In this paper, we construct time-varying, bank-specific measures of the
competitive pressures facing individual banks in the United States over the
1980s and 1990s. We do this by (1) exploiting the quasi-random, state-specific
process of interstate bank deregulation and (2) integrating these state-year
measures of regulatory-induced competition with the gravity model of
investment to obtain bank-year measures of competition. Furthermore, we use
several market-based measures of bank risk that avoid several shortcomings
associated with accounting-based risk measures.
We discover that an intensification of competition among banks
increases bank risk. This finding holds across different measures of risk and
different measures of the competitive pressures affecting individual banks.
Our results also highlight several potential channels connecting competition
and bank risk. That is, competition reduces bank profits, lowers bank charter
values, increases the provision of nontraditional banking products and services,
and diminishes relationship lending.

Variable Name

Table 1. Variable Definition
Definition

Risk Measures
Total Risk

Log(standard deviation of annualized daily stock returns on a BHC’s stock
over the year *100).

Tail Risk

Log(the negative of the average return on a BHC’s stock during its 5% worst
return days over the year *100, annualized).

Residual Risk-CAPM

Log(standard deviation of the residuals from the market model*100); The
market model is the CAPM one factor model.

Residual Risk-Fama French

Log(standard deviation of the residuals from the market model *100); The
market model is the Fama French three factor model.

Residual Risk-GG

Log(standard deviation of the residuals from the market model*100); The
market model is the three factor model in Gatev, Schuermann, and Strahan
(2009) and Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2016): 𝑟𝑏𝑏 = α + 𝛽1 ∙ 𝑟𝑚𝑚 + 𝛽2 ∙
∆(Baa − Aaa)𝑡 + 𝛽3 ∙ ∆(3 − month T − Bill)𝑡 + ε.

Implied Asset Volatility

Log(standard deviation of the asset return implicit in Merton’s (1974) option
pricing model*100).

Asset Risk

Log(standard deviation of annualized daily stock returns on a BHC’s stock
over the year *100) divided by (1 – book value of equality/total assets).

Systemic Risk - MES

To measure the degree to which a BHC’s value moves closely with the
aggregate market during its worst days, we follow Acharya, Pedersen,
Philippon, and Richardson (2017) and (a) identify the 5% lowest market return
days in a year, (b) compute the annualized average return of a BHC during
those days, and (c) multiply this annualized average return by negative one.

Systemic Risk - ∆CoVaR

To measure the degree to which an individual BHC’s risk contributes to the
risk of the entire financial system, we follow Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016)
calculation of ΔCoVaR, equals the change of the CoVaR conditional on a single
institution being under distress relative to its median state, where CoVaR, or
“conditional VaR” is defined as the value at risk of the entire financial system
(VaR) conditional on a single financial institution being in a particular state. As
with common measures of the VaR of an individual financial institution,
Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR is computed for a particular “distress” level, and we
use the 95% quantile of the worst weekly stock returns.

Competition Measures
Competition (Distance
Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each BHC b in
year t by weighting its assets across all subsidiaries by the regulation-induced
competition pressure facing each subsidiary i. To calculate the regulatory
environment facing each subsidiary in each year, we first identify all states
(k’s) whose BHCs are allowed (by state j’s regulators) to establish subsidiaries
in j. We then measure the distance from each subsidiary bank to the capital of
every other state k by computing the road distance between two zip codes
using Google maps api. For each subsidiary i in state j in year t, we weight the
interstate deregulation between state j and k in period t by that subsidiary’s
inverse log-distance to the other state.

35

Competition (Distance and # of
BHCs Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each BHC b in
year t by weighting its assets across all subsidiaries by the regulation-induced
competition pressure facing each subsidiary i. To calculate the regulatory
environment facing each subsidiary in each year, we first identify all states
(k’s) whose BHCs are allowed (by state j’s regulators) to establish subsidiaries
in j. We then measure the distance from each subsidiary bank to the capital of
every other state k by computing the road distance between two zip codes
using Google maps api. For each subsidiary i in state j in year t, we weight the
interstate deregulation between state j and k in period t by that subsidiary’s
inverse log-distance to the other state. We further weight this regulatory
environment index by the number of banks in the other state.

Competition (Distance and GSP
Weighted)

We calculate the interstate bank competitive pressure facing each BHC b in
year t by weighting its assets across all subsidiaries by the regulation-induced
competition pressure facing each subsidiary i. To calculate the regulatory
environment facing each subsidiary in each year, we first identify all states
(k’s) whose BHCs are allowed (by state j’s regulators) to establish subsidiaries
in j. We then measure the distance from each subsidiary bank to the capital of
every other state k by computing the road distance between two zip codes
using Google maps api. For each subsidiary i in state j in year t, we weight the
interstate deregulation between state j and k in period t by that subsidiary’s
inverse log-distance to the other state. We further weight this regulatory
environment index by the economic size (GSP per capita in $10,000) of the
other state.

Deregulation

A dummy variable that equals zero in the years before the state first allows
banks from any other state to enter and equals one otherwise.

Bank Concentration

The summation of squared BHC asset shares in each state j and year t.

Control Variables
Log(Total Asset)

The natural logarithm of total assets in ‘000 $ in year t-1.

Deposit To Asset

Ratio of total deposits over total assets in year t-1.

Loan To Asset

Ratio of total loans over total assets in year t-1.

Capital To Asset

Ratio of book value of equity over total assets in year t-1.

Charter Value

The natural logarithm of market value of assets over book value of assets.

Profitability

Net income over total assets.

Noninterest Income/Total
Income

The natural logarithm of (income from fiduciary activities + noninterest
income from trading assets and liabilities + other noninterest income +
account-based service charges)/total income.
The natural logarithm of (income from fiduciary activities + noninterest
income from trading assets and liabilities + other noninterest income +
account-based service charges)/net interest income.
A dummy variable that equal to one if a borrower has never borrowed loans
from the lender, and zero otherwise.

Table 3. Validation Test: Banking Deregulations and Lagged Bank Risks
This table presents OLS regression results of the timing and intensity of interstate bank deregulation on lagged measures of the riskiness of state banking systems. The
sample consists of state-year observations from 1980 to 1995. The dependent variable in columns 1-3 and 7-8 is Deregulation, which is a dummy variable that equals zero
in the years before the state first allows banks from any other state to enter and equals one otherwise. The dependent variable in columns 4-6 and 10-12 is
Num_of_States, which represents for each state j and year t the natural logarithm of one plus the number of states that are allowed to enter into state j. The explanatory
variables measure the riskiness of the state’s banking system. Specifically, State Total Risk (State Tail Risk) n year average before interstate deregulation is n-year average
risk of a state’s banking system, which is the weighted average of Total Risk (Tail Risk) across all BHCs in the state, where the weights are the assets of the BHCs, and
where the aggregation is done over n years before the interstate deregulation variable (Deregulation or Num_of_States). Control variables include GSP per capita, state
level unemployment rate, unit banking laws, small firm share in the state, small bank share in the state, capital ratio of small banks relative to large banks, relative size of
insurance in states where banks can sell insurance, relative size of insurance in states where banks cannot sell insurance, an indicator for one party control in the state, and
share of state government controlled by Democrats. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are provided in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 1%, 5%,
and 10%.

Table 5. Competition and Bank Risk-Taking: Residual Risk, Implied Asset Volatility, Asset Risk, and Systemic Risk
This table presents regression results of bank risk on bank competition using seven alternative measures of bank risk. The sample consists of BHC-year
observations from 1987 through 1995. The dependent variables are Residual Risk –CAPM, Residual Risk –Fama French, Residual Risk –GG (in columns 1-3),
Implied Asset Volatility (column 4), Asset Risk (column 5), Systemic Risk-MES (column 6), and Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR95 (column 7), respectively. Residual Risk –
CAPM equal to Log(annualized standard deviation of the residual from the market model*100). Residual Risk –Fama French equal to Log(annualized standard
deviation of the residual from the market model *100); The market model is the Fama French three-factor model. Residual Risk –GG equal to Log(annualized
standard deviation of the residual from the market model*100), where the market model is the three factor model in Gatev, Schuermann, and Strahan (2009) and
Goetz, Laeven, and Levine (2016): 𝑟𝑏 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 ∙ 𝑟𝑚 + 𝛽2 ∙ ∆(𝐵𝐵𝐵 − 𝐴𝐴𝐴) + 𝛽3 ∙ ∆(3 − 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚ℎ 𝑇 − 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵) + 𝜀. Implied Asset Volatility equal to Log(annualized
standard deviation of the asset return implicit in Merton’s option pricing model*100). Asset Risk is the standard deviation of daily stock return over the year
divided by (1 – book value of equality/total assets). Systemic Risk-MES is defined as the marginal expected shortfall that we take the 5% worst days for the market
returns in a given year, compute the average return of a BHC during those days and then times negative one. Systemic Risk-∆CoVaR is defined as the difference
between the CoVaR conditional on the distress of an institution and the CoVaR conditional on the median state of that institution, where distress CoVaR is
calculated as the 95% quantile of value at risk (VaR value) for the financial system conditional on BHC i is at its 95% quantile VaR. The regressions report the
results for the Competition (Distance Weighted) measure of bank risk. Control variables include Log(Total Asset), Deposit to Asset, Loan to Asset, and Capital to
Asset. All the control variables are lagged one year prior to the observation of the dependent variable. Detailed definitions of all the variables can be found in Table
1. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the state level are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%,
respectively.

Table 6. Competition and Bank Risk-Taking: Alternative Samples
This table presents regression results of bank risk on bank competition using two subsamples of BHCs: 1) BHCs that have not been involved in any merger and
acquisition activities from 1987 through 1995 (columns 1-6) and 2) small BHCs, i.e., those with total assets that remain below the sample median over the entire sample
period (columns 7-12). The dependent variables are Total Risk (columns 1-3 and 7-9) and Tail Risk (columns 4-6 and 10-12). The regressions report the results for three
bank risk measures: Competition (Distance Weighted), Competition (Distance and # of BHCs Weighted), and Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted). Control
variables include Log(Total Asset), Deposit to Asset, Loan to Asset, and Capital to Asset. All the control variables are lagged one year prior to the observation of the
dependent variable. Detailed definitions of all the variables can be found in Table 1. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the state level are reported in
parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

Table 7. Competition Effect on Bank Charter Value and Profitability
This table presents regression results of charter value and profitability on bank competition. The sample consists
of BHC-year observations from 1987 through 1995. The dependent variables in columns 1-3 and 4-6 are Charter
Value and Profitability, respectively. Charter Value is defined as the natural logarithm of market value of assets
over book value of assets. Profitability is defined as net income over total assets. The regressions report the
results for three bank risk measures: Competition (Distance Weighted), Competition (Distance and # of BHCs
Weighted), and Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted). Control variables include Log(Total Asset), Deposit to
Asset, Loan to Asset, and Capital to Asset. All the control variables are lagged one year prior to the observation of
the dependent variable. Detailed definitions of all the variables can be found in Table 1. Heteroskedasticity robust
standard errors clustered at the state level are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significant at 10%,

Table 8. Competition Effect on Noninterest Income
This table presents regression results of noninterest income on bank competition. The sample consists of
BHC-year observations from 1987 through 1995. The dependent variable is Noninterest Income/Total
Income in columns 1-3, defined as the natural logarithm of (income from fiduciary activities + noninterest
income from trading assets and liabilities + other noninterest income + account-based service charges)/total
income, or Noninterest Income/Net Interest Income in columns 4-6, defined as the natural logarithm of
(income from fiduciary activities + noninterest income from trading assets and liabilities + other noninterest
income + account-based service charges)/net interest income. The regressions report the results for three
bank risk measures: Competition (Distance Weighted), Competition (Distance and # of BHCs Weighted), and
Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted). Control variables include Log(Total Asset), Deposit to Asset,
Loan to Asset, and Capital to Asset. All the control variables are lagged one year prior to the observation of
the dependent variable. Detailed definitions of all the variables can be found in Table 1. Heteroskedasticity

Table 9. Competition Effect on Lending to New Customers
This table presents regression results of lending to new customers on bank competition. The sample consists
of loan-year observations from 1987 through 1995. The dependent variable is New Customer defined as a
dummy variable that equal to one if a borrower has never borrowed loans from the lender, and zero otherwise.
Columns 1-3 (4-6) present results using Probit (OLS) model. The marginal effects (dy/dx) of the probit
regressions are presented. The marginal effect of a dummy variable is calculated as the discrete change in the
expected value of the dependent variable as the dummy variable changes from 0 to 1. The regressions report
the results for three bank risk measures: Competition (Distance Weighted), Competition (Distance and # of
BHCs Weighted), and Competition (Distance and GSP Weighted). Control variables include Log(Total Asset),
Deposit to Asset, Loan to Asset, and Capital to Asset. All the control variables are lagged one year prior to
the observation of the dependent variable. Detailed definitions of all the variables can be found in Table 1.
Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors clustered at the state level are reported in parentheses. *, **, and
