The Assessment of National Price Levels

ABSTRACT

This paper attempts to find norms for long—run national price levels,

therefore, by implication, for exchange rates, that are superior to
those implied by the absolute or relative versions of purchasing power
and

parity theory. The structural variables we have found to determine these
price levels, real income per capita, the openness of the economy, and the

share of tradables in total output, are used to explain price levels in
periods since 1960 and to some extent since 1950.
The results suggest that there was a movement toward a more "orderly"
alignment

is,

of price levels, especially in the period

before the 1970's. That

national price levels came to be explained to an increasing degree by

our structural variables.

The price levels implied by the structural equations appear to come
closer

to representing long—run equilibrium levels than do those implied by

purchasing power parity. The deviations from the structural equations seem

to have value in
rates,

predicting future changes in price levels or real exchange

in conbination with changes in the structural variables. And they

also contribute to predicting changes in the balance of trade.

RESEARCH SUMMARY

Synopsis

Issues: Is there a standard for judging national price levels, and
therefore exchange rates, that is superior to the criterion that

they should be equal in all countries? Equality is the norm set
by the purchasing power parity theory. In this paper we ask
whether there are long—run determinants of national price levels
that keep some of them (the U.S., for example) above the world
average and some of them below the average without necessarily
producing adverse effects on the countries concerned or inducing
any movement of exchange rates toward equality of price levels.

Results: A country's national price level for all the goods and
services that make up GDP is determined to a large extent by
its real per capita income, the degree of openness of its economy,
and the proportion of its aggregate output that consists of non—

tradables, mainly services. The higher the income level and the
higher the proportion of nontradables, the higher the price level

in the long run. A more open economy tends to have a higher price
level if it is a poor country but a lower price level if it is a
rich country.

The degree to which these characteristics explain national

—2---

price levels increased over the last thirty years or so. That is,
the structure of international price levels became more orderly.
During the 1950's, the dispersion in price levels (deviations from

purchasing power parity) decreased. In later years, the dispersion increased, but more and more of it was explained by these

structural variables. Not only do the structural variables
explain differences in price levels at a given time but changes in

these variables help to explain changes in price levels. Thus a
rise in a country's relative income level tends to raise the
country's relative price level.

Deviations from the price levels implied by our equations
tend to be persistent over the medium term but disappear over long

periods. In contrast, deviations from equality of price levels
appear to be permanent; a country with a high price level in one
period is likely to have a high price level twenty years later.

Policy Implications
Measures taken to influence exchange rates are really aimed at

affecting national price levels. Such efforts require a notion of what is
in some sense an appropriate price level for a country and of what is an

inappropriate level. We find strong evidence that the U.S. price level can
be expected to be, typically, above that of almost any other country,
mainly because the U.S. has the highest, or one of the highest, per capita

income levels. For the same reason, we should expect that countries such
as Italy, the United Kingdom, and Japan will tend to have lower price

levels than the U.S. and most major European countries. The developing

—3—
countries will typically have still lower price levels.
One implication of these results is that, since these relationships
seem to be very durable, they are not indications of disequilibria in

exchange rates. Efforts to move these price levels toward equality might
well be futile or disruptive.

Further Research
Although we have succeeded in explaining much of the variance in price
levels with the structural variables we have included, considerable unex-

plained deviations remain and appear to be fairly persistent. It would be
desirable to search further for possibly omitted structural variables.
Beyond that, the next step should be a search for short—run influences

that produce short—run deviations from the structural relationships. These
influences would include monetary and fiscal developments and capital
flows, although the last may be quite long—lasting in their effects.

We have made a first effort to judge the effects of high or low price
levels, relative to the expected ones, on a country's trade, but that is a

subject that needs further investigation. For example, does a persistently
high price level lead to a long—run trade deficit, or does it lead a
country to participate less in world markets without unbalancing trade?
Does a brief episode of high prices relative to long—run national price
levels produce temporary trade deficits?

THE ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL PRICE LEVELS1

Introduction

It has been evident for some time that there are large country to
country differences in national price levels. Equality of price levels—-sometimes referred to as the "law of one price" or "purchasing power

parity"2——is not the norm. International comparisons of prices and incomes
from the UN International Comparison Project (IcP) have shown that price level
disparities often involve spreads of 2 to 1 and can be as big as 3 to 1
(Kravis, 1984; Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982). Other independent investigations lead to the same conclusion.3 Also, the time—to—time variability of
exchange rates in recent years, clearly unmatched by the changes in price

'We are indebted for valuable suggestions to the participants in two
meetings of the AEI—NBER project on Real—Financial Linkages in Open Economics,
particularly Robert Feenstra, Peter Hooper, Paul Krugman, and David
Richardson, and also to participants in a session at the annual meeting of the
Western Economic Association in 1985 and a seminar at the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York. We are grateful to Linda Molinari and David
Robinson for programming and statistical work and to Nancy Bansall, James
Hayes, and Rosa Schupbach for preparation of the manuscript.

2'Purchasing power parity" in this sentence is used in the sense of Cassel's
theory holding that price levels will be equal after conversion to a common
currency via exchange rates. Elsewhere (for example, Kravis, Heston, and
Summers, 1982; Kravis and Lipsey, 1983; and Kravis, 1984), the term has been
used in an empirical sense to denote the number of currency units having the
same purchasing power as a unit of a numeraire currency, usually the U.S.
dollar. The term is employed in both senses in this paper; the context should
make it clear which meaning is intended.
3For example, a recent report by Peter Hill (1985) of work by the OECD
showed the 1984 price levels of 18 member countries varying from 52 per cent
of the U.S. (Spain) to 97 per cent (Finland). Another study, this one carried
out by the Statistical Office of the European Community covering 15 African
countries found 1980 price levels varying from 56 per cent of the average for
the 15 (Ethiopia) to 126 per cent (Nigeria).

—2--

levels called for by the theory, have tilted the weight of opinion against the
validity of the relative version of the purchasing power parity theory.
Offsetting changes in international price movements and in exchange rates are
not the norm either.

Nevertheless, the purchasing power parity theory of exchange rates
continues to be invoked as a reference point in discussions of exchange rate
behavior, such as those relating to over— or under— valuation of currencies
and overshooting. The implicit assumption often is made that the exchange
rates of some past period were normal and that equilibrium will be attained
when the exchange rates of that period, or the exchange rates adjusted for
differences in inflation (real exchange rates) are restored. In the latter
case, the assumption is that the "real exchange rate" would be constant in
equilibrium. This means, in other words, that the relationship between the
price levels of different countries would be constant. A large part of the
reason for the use of the PPP theory in these contexts is that there is no
other reference point.

This paper represents an attempt to provide an alternative (see also

work along these lines by Clague, 1986). Our approach is based on the notion
that there is a structural relationship between price levels and basic
national economic characteristics, such as per capita income and propensity to
trade. We investigate the hypothesis that the price level of each country
tends toward a norm, changing slowly over time, which can be established on
the basis of this structural relationship, rather than on the assumption of
identical price levels or identical changes in price levels. Price level differences in this view may be expected to be persistent, and they are not

—3--

necessarily inconsistent with trade equilibrium. While the relationships of
the price levels of different countries are determined by long—run factors,
short—run influences can cause price levels to deviate from their structural
norms.

Some of these issues were explored in terms of a 1975 cross section
in an earlier paper (Kravis and Lipsey, 1983). In the present paper we extend
the investigation to the period 1960—83, focusing on explaining long— or
intermediate—term movements of price levels.

The international differences in price levels provide a link between
the price level, which can be regarded as a financial variable, and the key
real variables in the economic system. In some versions of the monetary theory
of the balance of payments, the law of one price is assumed to prevail and the
price level is a financial variable with little or no lasting effects. In the
view taken here, which we believe reflects reality better, the general price
level for GDP as a whole has imbedded in it sets of prices that can and do
differ from country to country, thereby directly and indirectly influencing
the nation's transactions with its trading and financial partners. Some of
these prices affect the flows of goods; others the flows of capital. The
literature dealing with the influence of prices on trade flows is voluminous;4
that dealing with the

role

of prices in affecting capital flows is much

sparser. Neither is assessed here; our focus is on the price level itself as
an important link in the real—financial economic nexus. However, we do
investigate whether deviations from our price level "norms" have any power in

I. Background
The Price Level and the Real Exchange Rate
The price level (FL), upon which this work focuses, is defined as the
ratio of the purchasing power parity of a currency (PPP) to its exchange rate
(ER), both taken relative to the U.S. dollar as the numeraire currency.5

Purchasing power parity is defined in turn as the number of units of a
currency that have the same command over GDF as a U.S. dollar. Reliable
purchasing power parities require careful price comparisons for a sample of
commodities and services representative of GDP.6 When the extrapolations on which this paper is based were performed, parities for 1975

were available from the U.N. International Comparison Project (ICP)
for 34 countries.7 The basic data used in this paper are these
purchasing power parities extrapolated on an annual basis backward,

for the most part to 1960, and frward to 1983, using each country's
implicit GDP deflators. For some of the 34 countries, data necessary
for the analysis were not available for all the years of th.e period,

and the discussion in this paper is therefore based on 25 or sometimes only 19 countries.8 In some cases countries were dropped because

5For example, the purchasing power parity of the Japanese yen in 1975 was
271 per U.S. dollar and the exchange rate 2971$. Thus, with the U.S. dollar
as the numeraire, set equal to 100, the Japanese price level in 1975 was 91.

exchange rates that reflected the large prel)OflderanCe of the
country's

international

transactions were not available. In other

instances data on the division of GDP between tradahies and nontra—

dables were missing for some years and it was not possible to
construct figures on implicit deflators for tradables and nontra—

dables.9 Even for included countries, there are sometimes uncertainties about the choice of a representative exchange rate, especially
in the cases of some developing

rates

countries. Errors in the exchange

are imparted to the PLs and if the time—to—time movement of the

exchange rate series is also different from the true series, errors

are introduced also into our time—to—time movements of FL.
Our focus on the price level differs from the usual formulation in
terms of intertemporal indexes of "real exchange rates" found in the substan-

tial theoretical

and empirical literature on exchange rate determination. The

9We work with two different sets of definitions of tradahies and nontra—
dables, one based on a subdivision of expenditures on GDP into various categories of final demand (e.g., shoes), and the other based on a subdivision of
CDP according to its industrial origins (e.g., the leather industry, the shoe
industry, etc.). The final demand categories——representing purchases not
intended for resale——are used in the UN International Comparison Project and
are followed here when equations based directly on ICP data are presented. The
final demand classification is not available for other years on a comparable
basis. Use has therefore been made of a definition of tradables based on more
widely available industry—originating data: the output of agricultural,
mining, and manufacturing industries has been regarded as tradable and the
rest of GDP as nontradahie. The industry—originating classification, of
course, includes both final and intermediate goods directly; the final demand
classification includes intermediate goods only as part of the value of
final goods. While the dividing line between tradahies and nontradables in
the industry—originating classification is somewhat arbitrary, it does
distinguish groups of industries that in the aggregate differ a great deal
with respect to the importance of trade. For the group of industries we
include under tradables, the ratios of exports to output and imports to
output in the U.S. in 1976 were each around 9 to 10 per cent. For the group
we include under nontradables, aside from general government, the ratios
were under 2 per cent (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1983, Table 1).

—6—

most common definition of the real exchange rate (RER) refers to the intertem—
poral movement of the

nominal rate corrected for the relative movement of pri-

ces in the given country and the numeraire country (see, for example, Krueger,

1983).10 The intertemporal

index of PL (IPL), on the other hand, can be

regarded as the movement of a country's own—currency price level corrected for
the movement of the nominal exchange rate. Thus the RER and IPL are recipro—

cals, provided that the same price indexes are used in constructing the two
measures. We have argued elsewhere that the implicit
appropriate

price

GOP deflator is the

one to use, although the wholesale price index and the consumer

index are often employed (Kravis and Lipsey, 1978, p. 199—201).

We prefer the "IPL" concept to RER' because IPL is a more natural
companion to PL in analyses involving the comparison of levels as well as

intertemporal changes. Formulating the problem in terms of both comparative
price levels and changes in price levels permits us to examine the possibility
that it is the levels that identify disequilibrium situations; a country is in
disequilibrium because its prices are too high rather than because they have

risen. A change in price levels through changes in either exchange rates or
relative own—currency inflation rates may be a response to an unsustainable
price level.

'°The real exchange rate is sometimes defined in theoretical literature as
the change in the price of tradables relative to that of nontradables
(e.g., Bergias and Razin). This definition is appropriate only if the
price of tradables is the same at home and abroad (or if not the same, in a
constant relationship). Among 25 ICP countries (15 developing and 10
developed) the price level for tradables varied in 1975 from 46 percent
(Pakistan) to 144 percent (Denmark) of the U.S. level. ICP data are from
Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982. The classification used in that work
groups construction with commodities rather than with services. However, for
the tradables—nontradables dichotomy, as already noted, commodities excluding
construction are regarded as tradahies and services plus construction as
noritradable.

1975. The

variables were real COP

plus imports (from national accounts data) divjded by GOP, and the

per capita (r), openness (OP) defined as

share of nontradabies in final expenditures on GOP (SN). Corresponding

equations based on the 25 ICP countries used for this paper'1 are as follows:

'The variables are scaled differently in the present equations; the U. S.
is set equal to 100 for FL and r; OP is entered as a ratio and SN as a

percentage. The mean FL for the 25 countries is 70.2. Some minor corrections
in the price levels have also been made. t—values are in parentheses below

The latest round of the I[CP, for 1980, covers a much larger number of

countries, but at this point data are available only for the variables of

much lower in the later equation than in equation (1)

and the coefficient for r is also much lower. There are two possible explanations for the difference. One is that the relationship did change over time;
the

other is that the additional countries, mainly developing, added in the

broader

survey

the other

did not exhibit the same relationship between price level and

variables as the smaller group. We

can

test for the

source

of the

difference by running the equation with 1980 data for those countries (25) for

which 1975 data were also available. The list of countries is not identical to

that included in the rest of this

paper, but 22 of the 25 are the same.

(Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain are included here hut Jamaica, Malaysia,
and Pakistan are excluded). That equation is:

No.Obs. = 25

The resulting equation is very close to equation 1 with respect to
the size of the constant term, the coefficient of r, and the R2 despite the
difference in country coverage. Thus, it seems safe to say that there was no
major change in the relationship from the substitution of 1980 relative prices
and quantities for those of 1975. However, the addition of more countries did
blur the relationship considerably, particularly because three newly—added
low—income African countries, Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast, had
extremely high price levels, two even above that for the U.S.

The rationale for the selection of the explanatory variables has been
previously explained (e.g., Kravis and Lipsey, 1983, pp. 11—16, and Bhagwati,
1984), but it may be worthwhile to outline the arguments briefly. We take the
occasion also to develop a little further our use of the openness variable.
The positive association between PL and r is attributable to higher
prices of nontradables relative to tradables in higher income countries. The
explanation may be couched in terms of rich—country margins of superiority in
productivity that are smaller for nontradables, expecially services, than for
tradables, or in terms of the tendency for nontradables to be labor intensive
and for labor to be more costly relative to other factors of production in
high income countries than in low—income countries.

In general, we may expect high foreign trade/GDP ratios to reduce
country—to—country divergences in price levels. Trade not only operates
directly in pulling prices of tradables towards greater uniformity, but
affects the prices of nontradables by tending to raise the prices of relati—

— 10 —

vely

abundant factors and lowering the

prices

of relatively scarce ones. If

poor countries tend to have abundant labor, and if nontradahies (comprised
largely of services) tend to be labor intensive, the effects of openness can
he predicted. As between two countries with equal low incomes, the one with
the higher

level of openness should have higher prices for nontradables and

for G1)P as a whole. As between two countries with equal high incomes, the one
with

the

higher level of openness should have lower prices.

The justification we give for the

openness

variable implies that the

direction of its influence should vary with the factor abundance of the
country involved. If we assume that the level of real income per capita is a
good proxy for capital abundance (or labor scarcity), we could include a term
for the conbinatfon of real income per capita (r) and openness (OP), and the
coefficient for this cross—product term should he negative. Equations 1C and
2C

correspond

to equations 1 and 2 with the addition of this term:

The rOP term meets our expectations in one respect hut not in

Over time, the impact of OP may vary according to the direction of
changes

not only in OP but also in the degree of responsiveness of internal

prices to world markets. Increased and more rapidly diffused information nay

result in a larger impact for a given level of openness than was observed in

an earlier period.
The positive sign on

the

share coefficient, share being defined in

terms of the current value of output in own prices, implies that, given real
GOP per capita and openness, high nontradables shares in final expenditures
are associated with high nontradables prices. Such a relationship may be

attributable to elasticities of substitution between tradahies and nontra—
dables in final demand that are below i.13

II. The Price Level for GDP
The Structural Equation for PL
The further explanation of comparative national price levels starts

with the modification of equation (2) prior to fitting it to data for years

other than 1975 in the period 1960—83. The formulation in equation (2) has
the

disadvantage that two

of the

independent variables,

OP and SN,

overlap.

A problem encountered in the use of the

prototypes for the investigation of long—run trends is that the ICP estimate of the share of tradahies, used to form OPT and ST, is defined in

terms of final products (i.e., goods purchased for final use and not for
use

as intermediate products) and is not readily available for other

years.'5 This difficulty is not insuperable because a rough estimate of the
tradables

component of GDP can be derived from data, available in national

accounts, on the share of GDP accounted for by different industries, each
of

which produces both final and intermediate products. For this purpose,

as noted earlier, tradables have been defined as the output of agriculture,
mining, and manufacturing, leaving the output of construction and of the

service industries to be regarded

as nontradables. The modified OPT and T

variables, OPTI and STI, respectively, produce similar results when substituted in equation (4):

country incomes around the mean remained almost constant (column 4).
The

share of tradables in total GDP drifted downwards (column 9),

as

service industry output grew relative to goods output, but the ratio of goods
actually traded to tradables output rose sharply, especially in the 1970s
(column 7). That rise in the trade ratio was partly a direct reflection of the
increase in the price of oil, a heavily traded commodity, but was not confined

to that group. It was evident also within manufactured goods (see Lipsey,
1984).

the Structural Relationships
Table 2

shows the results of fitting equations like (4A) to each of

8 cross sections. It is evident that there were marked secular trends in
the coefficients of real per capita GDP and openness. In each case, the coefficient tends to rise through time, with the increases tending to be larger in
the early 1970s at about the the time that the Bretton woods regime ended.

is, the price levels of the countries became more sharply differentiated

according to their income levels and the extent of their participation in the
international economy. At the same time, the explanatory power of the independent variables increased markedly; the t—statistics and the R2s are clearly

higher in the later periods. The "unexplained" deviations from the law of one
price therefore increased much less than the deviations themselves.

To trace the changes in these relationships back to the 1950s, it is
necessary to revert to equation (1) and to rely on data for a smaller number
of countries. In Table 3, the results of equation (1) are presented for 23
countries based on data for 1950—1962 and for the same 25 countries as in
Table 2 for 1960—1983, with 1960—62 as an overlapping period.

The

"orderly' alignment of PLs was very substantial during the 1950s.'1 The

equations for the first three periods do not even meet a test of significance
at the 5 per cent level, but the degree to which our equations explained
price levels, as measured by the R2s, increased monotonica.lLy from the early

1950s to the 1960s and, in fact, through the early 1970s, after which it
changed only slightly. For a good part of the period, up to the end of the era
of fixed" exchanged rates, the standard error of the equations declined

almost continuously. For the first couple of periods at least, that decline
must have represented a fall in the variance of price levels themselves, that

is,

a

move towards aligning exchange rates with the purchasing power of

currencies,
that,

since our equations showed no significant coefficients. After

however, and particularly during the

era of floating

exchange rates,

price levels came to be explained more and more by per capita income and openness, until the last period, when the openness variable suddenly vanished.
If we add the cross—product term rOPTI to the equations of Table 2 to
permit the direction of the openness effect to vary with income level, we get
the set of coefficients displayed in Table 4. The degrees of explanation and
the

standard errors are

quite similar to those of the

earlier table, but the

openness coefficients are very different and show the expected interrelation
with

income levels. In the

last equation, for example, the coefficients imply

they are extrapolated so far from the 1975 base. They do, however, match

Aside

from the increasing explanatory power of the equations, it

is clear in all the sets of equations that the slope of the relationship between per capita income and

The coefficients for openness had a different history. In equations without a
cross—product term (Tables 2 and 3), they played no role at all for the period
of

fixed exchange rates, increased in importance afterwards, and virtually

disappeared in the last period. When the cross—product term rOPTI was added

other across periods, as is discussed later, and the same variables are

equations, since they have been fitted to the price levels of each

period. Even so, it is of some interest that the fit can be so good using a
common set of independent variables for all the periods, without taking into
account the many short—term factors that can cause price levels to change if
own—price inflation rates and changes in exchange rates are not exactly offsetting.

Several tests of predictive or explanatory value with respect to
changes in price levels could he constructed. We

the

structural equations for a previous period, in explaining price levels and

changes in them. Since the relative form of PPP theory implies no change in
price levels, any contribution these equations and/or changes in these
variables

can make in explaining price level changes is an improvement on

the theory.
Our test asks whether the structure of one period and the observed

values of the independent variables for the next period, predict the next
period's price levels. Because we know that the deviations from the structural equation tend to persist from period to period, we include each period's
deviations in the equation for the following period.
The predictions of price levels for all eight cross sections combined
are shown in equation 6.

It is based on structural equations with r, OPTI,

the cross—product term rOPTI, and STI as independent variables.

assumed that market forces

hypothesis is that these forces operate on traded goods prices but not, or to
a much smaller extent, on nontradables prices. To test whether that is the
case we will perform the same comparisons and tests on PLTR, the price level

for tradables, as on the aggregate price level.

Price

Levels for Tradables and Nontradables

The likelihood of large deviations from international equality of
price levels is more readily acceptable for nontradables than for tradables,

as is the possibility that price levels should be related to income or other
variables. A number of theoretical analyses of price levels take account of
this difference, as was pointed Out lfl

our

earlier paper (Kravis and Lipsey,

1983). It was also pointed out there that, although the relationship was not
quite

as strong, the

variables that explained aggregate price levels also went

a long way in explaining price levels for tradables. That result does not

necessarily contradict the theories that imply the equalization of prices of
some type of "pure" tradables but it limits their empirical applicability.
The measured prices of tradables inevitably incorporate some nontradable

inputs, such as wholesale or retail services, and would differ among countries

even if "pure" tradable prices were equalized.
There is
prices

a

particular interest in the

determinants

of the two sets of

separately, since we might expect that departures of tradables prices

from equilibrium might be more quickly erased by changes in exchange rates
than those of the total

tors of

price level. They are also likely to he better indica-

any deliberate efforts by governments to influence trade flows and to

be more influential in determining trade flows.

For the benchmark year 1975, the equations for the price levels for
GDP as a whole (FL) and for tradables (PLTR) and nontradables (PLNT), based on
data for the 25 countries of Tables 1 and 2, are as follows:

As we might expect, the levels for nontradables prices are better
explained than those for tradables prices, and the coefficient for r is considerably higher. That seems reasonable in view of the explanations we have
given for the relationship between income per capita and price levels. The
coefficient for openness is larger in the equation for tradahies, suggesting
that the influence of competition with other countries plays more of a role
for these products than for nontradables, in addition to effects of trade on
factor prices.

In Table 8, similar equations for tradables and nontradables are
fitted to data for our successive 3—year non—overlapping periods21. As in the
benchmark year equations, the prices of nontradables, viewed across countries,
rise more sharply with increasing per capita incomes (r) than the prices of
tradables.22 The coefficients for openness, the ratio of goods actually traded
to tradables, were similar in the two sets of equations, but the interaction
between per capita income and openness was much stronger for nontradahies.

21Qnly 19 countries were included in the Table 8 regressions, because
time series on GDP originating in different sectors in current and constant
prices, necessary to derive implicit deflators for tradables and nontra—
dables, were not available for the others. See notes to Table 8. It
should be added to those notes that the constant price series for the different economic sectors are in many instances subject to large margins of
error and to country to country differences arising out of the use of different methods. We do not see any reason to believe that these incom—
parabilities bias the 19—country data in ways that invalidate our uses of
them.

22Tradahles were defined as final expenditures on commodities other than
construction in the benchmark year and as the output of agriculture, mining and
manufacturing in the Table 8 equations.

Based on data for 19 countries, those listed in Table 1 with the exception

tradables and nontradables, derived from ICP exchange rates and price levels
(Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982, pp. 10 and 196), were extrapolated to other
years by the use of implicit deflators. The implicit deflator for tradables
was derived by taking the ratio of CDP originating in agriculture, mining and
manufacturing at current prices to the GDP originating in these industries at
constant prices (data fron IBRD, 1984 Economic Data Sheet 1). The implicit
deflator for nontradahies was formed in a similar way on the basis of GDP originating in other sectors. r and OPTI were the same as in Table 2.

In

1978—80, when the U.S. price level was very low, the coefficient for the

interaction between real per capita income and openness is not only insignificant but even has the wrong sign.

III. Deviations From the Structural Equations and Their Significance
The Pattern of Residuals

There are a number of ways to interpret the deviations of price
levels from those predicted by our equations and to think about their con-

sequences. If we regard the equations as representing estimates of
equilibrium price levels, we might expect that deviations from them would be

ephemeral. They might be quickly erased by movements of exchange rates, especially in the floating exchange rate period, or by price movements, especially
in the fixed exchange—rate era. If the deviations are long—lasting, they might
reflect the omission from our equations of significant structural variables,
such as the inflow or outflow of capital. They might, on the other hand,
reflect government policies that sustain disequilibrium price levels for long
periods, for example by maintaining overvalued exchange rates and exchange
controls or by maintaining undervalued rates to promote exports.23
One way of analyzing the persistence of residuals is by measuring
whether the countries that have high price levels (PL), relative to those predicted by the equations (PL), in one period tend to have high price levels

in preceding or following periods. An answer to this question is given in

231n this case, we might have to consider the possibility that our openness
variable should be treated as partly endogenous. For example, an artificially
sustained high exchange rate that produced a large positive deviation from the
structural price level would reduce exports and perhaps force the country to
cut imports as well. It might he appropriate to examine this possibility by
substituting for openness itself a variable that represents the permanent
determinants of openness, such as country size and population density.

Table 9, which shows the correlations among residuals in different periods
for the structural equations found in Table 4. Similar results are obtained

when the

other structural equations of Tables 2 and 3

are used.

is clearly a strong tendency for the deviations to be similar
for a country in the different periods. Although the association atrophies
There

with time, the correlation coefficients are all positive and are usually
significant at the 5 per cent level (r > .40) between a given period and each
of

three or four prior and three or four

subsequent periods.

The 25 countries included in the analysis are grouped in Table 10
according to their long—run tendency to have low, intermediate or high price
levels after the price levels have been purged of structural influences as
measured by equation 4A, that is, after levels of real income per capita,
openness, and the share of nontradables in output have been taken into
account. For the most

part, countries with actual PLs falling far short of the

PLs estimated by the equation tended to have such shortfalls (negative
residuals) consistently across the seven periods.24 Similarly, countries with

24The identifiction of the countries with low purged (or residual) price
levels (i.e., PL—PL) or high ones is fairly robust to small changes in the
specification of the structural equation, such as the use of OP or OPT instead
of OPTI or the substitution of logs for arithmetic values. There is, however,
the possibility that errors in the 1975 benchmark measures ofPL are simply
being extrapolated to other years. Some assurance that is not the case is
given by a comparison of the 1980 PLs for 10 industrial countries extrapolated
from our 1975 benchmarks with the 1980 PLs produced by a new OECD benchmark
study (Hill 1985), most of the data representing comparisons carried out by
the Statistical Office of the European Community (1982). The coefficient of
rank correlation was 0.78. The three countries with the lowest PLs were identical and so were the three with the highest PLs, though within neither set of
three were the rankings identical and a fourth country was in a tie for the
eighth rank (from low to high) in our estimates. The possibility remains, of
course, that the statistical system of the country, which provides the basic
data for the international comparisons, produces prices or expenditures that
are biased relative to those produced by other countries. The reasonableness
of the conformances of the benchmark series does not provide proof against
this untoward outcome.

actual

PLs far exceeding estimated PLs tended to have positive residuals that

also appeared rather consistently. Trends in the residuals characterized
several countries, as noted in the table. One of the pronounced ones was for
the U.S.; the U.S. residual moved almost monotonically from +9.2 in 1960—62 to
—31.4 in 1978—80 but then declined sharply in absolute terms in the last period.
The behavior of price residuals for developed countries was somewhat

different from that for developing countries. In particular, all the 7
countries with consistent low residual price levels (negative residuals in 6,
7, or 8 periods, were developing countries.

Since the structural equations come closer than identity of price
levels to a representation of equilibrium price levels, the residuals from
identical price levels should be more persistent. Table 11 shows the persistence of deviations from purchasing power parity, as measured by the correlations between PLs in different periods.25 As we hypothesized, these
deviations are more persistent than those from the structural equations of
Table 9. The differences between the two sets of deviations are summarized
below:

is conceivable that the correlations are high because of non—persistent
variations in FL, but the frequent persistence of high or low deviations
(Table 10) makes this unlikely.

The correlations between price levels (that is, deviations from purchasing
power parity) in one period and those in succeeding periods are higher than
those for the residuals from the structural equations for every length of span,

but the differences are much greater for the longer spans. In other words, a
country with a high price level in one year is likely to have a high price
level

20 years later. On the other hand, a country with a high price level

relative to its structural characteristics, while it

will he likely

to still

have a high price level three years later, is not particularly likely to have
such a price level 15 or 20 years later. Our interpretation of this difference
is that the deviations from the levels predicted by the structural equations of
Table 4 represent something more like departures from long—run equilibrium

— 29 —

price

levels than the departures from purchasing power parity (equality of

price levels). The latter represent not only deviations from equilibrium but
also reflect long—run structural characteristics of the economies.

Residuals for Tradables and Nontradables
If equilibrium is more likely to be attained for tradables prices
than for PL as a whole, and if exchange rates are not too greatly affected by
intervention, deviations from the tradables equations might he expected to be
less persistent than those for PL. That proposition is tested in Table 12, a
companion to Table 9, but based on deviations of tradables prices from their
structural equations.

Within the fixed—rate era there was little difference in persistence
between tradahies residuals and those for the aggregate price level, as can be

seen below. Within the floating—rate period, the residuals for tradables

were a little less persistent than those for nontradables and the same was
true for intervals spanning the two periods.

To the extent that persistently high or low price levels relative to
those predicted by

our

equations represent policies of raising or depressing

exchange

rates rather than unaccounted—for characteristics of the economies,

we might

expect that they will operate equally on both tradable and nontra—

dable price levels. Also from a purely statistical standpoint, the shared
importance of tradables and nontradables in constituting GDP makes it
unsurprising that countries that tend to have high predicted price levels for
aggregate GDP generally tend to have high predicted price levels also for the
tradable and nontradable components of GDP.26 However, the connections were not
so close that there was not room for a variety of patterns; the coefficient of
correlation linking the PLTR and PLNT residuals was only .52. Thus, some
countries had higher price levels for tradahies relative to nontradables than
would be expected on the basis of the equations, and others exhibited the
opposite relationship. The prices of tradables were substantially higher.in
these terms in Mexico, India, France, and Uruguay and substantially lower
in Belgium, Korea, Thailand, and Japan (Table 13).27

the residuals from the PL equations and those from the PLTR equations was .87;

residuals, one relating to each of the seven periods.
would he interesting to investigate both the causes and consequences of
these differing price relationships, but that must remain a matter for future
research. (See, however, Kravis, lleston and Summers, 1983, and Kravis and
Lipsey, 1983 for the role of service prices which comprise the hulk of
nontradables).

acountries are ranked from large negative values of the residuals to high positive ones.
The residuals are averages of those from the 7 equations, one for each period. For
equations with PL as the dependent variable, r, OPTI, rOPTI, and STI were the independent
variables. For the equations explaining PLTR and PLNT, r, OPTI, and rOPTI were the independent variables.

of long—term relationship, we might expect then to have effects on sub-

sequent flows of exports and imports of goods and services. A high price level
relative to this norm (i.e., a large value for PL — PL) should reduce, and a

low price level should increase, exports relative to imports. This possibility
is tested in Table 14, in which we relate the price level deviations in the
first and fourth periods to changes in the export/import ratio between those
periods and the seventh and eighth periods, the longest spans for which we
have data.

The results give consistent, but weak support for the idea that some

such long—term relationships exist. A high price level in 1969—71 relative to
that predicted by a country's real income per capita, degree of openness, and
share of tradables in output was associated with a decline in exports relative
to imports over the period to 1978—80, but the relationship was much weaker

with the period ending in 1981—83. However, equations with fewer variables
(not shown) produced significant correlations over three of the five spans.
Over shorter periods, the coefficients were quite erratic and only
one was significant at the 1 per cent level: a high price level in 1969—71 was
associated with declines in the export/import ratio in the next period.
Given all that we know about the factors determining trade flows, it
is obvious that we have not specified a trade equation here. The most we might
say is that there is some indication that it may be worth including some such
measures of general price levels in more completely specified trade equations,
in addition to the usual measures of price change for specific products or
groups of products.

IV.
This paper

Summary arid Agenda for Future Research

starts

from the fact that neither the absolute nor the

relative version of purchasing power parity theory provides an adequate explanation for differences in national price levels. The former assumes that all
price levels are equal and the latter that they all change by identical
proportions. We have tried to find explanations for the price level differences that exist and for changes in relative levels that would be superior to
those assumptions. From these explanations, we attempt to derive some norms
for national price levels.

The structural determinants of national price levels discovered in
previous studies of data for 1975 and earlier years were still evident in the
latest and much broader survey covering 55 countries in 1980. We fitted similar cross sections to a number of sub—periods over 23 years, relating price
levels to real income per capita, the openness of the economy, and, the share
of tradables in total output.

These equations suggested that since 1960 or even 1950, there has
been a movement towards a more "orderly" alignment of price levels. That is,
national price levels came to be explained to an increasing degree by our
structural variables. Most of that increase in orderliness took place before

the 1970's. The degree to which these structural variables explained price
levels remained roughly constant after that and even declined a bit in the
last period, 1981—83.

The higher the real income per capita of a country, the higher was
its price level. In general, a greater degree of openness of an economy is
also associated with a higher price level, but there are indications that that

— 33 —

relationship

varies by income level. In poor countries, more openness is asso-

ciated with higher price levels; in rich countries with lower price levels.

The coefficients of the structural equations changed substantially
over time, the most important change being a gradual increase in the coefficient for real income per capita, at least through the end of the 1970's. We
have not so far been able to explain the changes in coefficients.

Various tests suggest that equations including variables such as
these do provide better explanations of both price levels and changes in price
levels than do assumptions of equality of levels or of changes in them.
Furthermore,

equations are

deviations of price levels from the norms provided by these
associated with movements back towards the norms over intervals

of several years and even over periods of one or two decades.

If the price level norms estimated from our equations are a better
approximation to long—term equilibrium levels than those implied by
purchasing jower parity theory, the deviations of actual PLs from their estimated values should tend to be less persistent over time. This does prove to
be the case. The correlation between deviations from PPP in one period and in
other periods was still above .75 after 20 years or more, while that for
deviations from the structural equations were lower than that after five
years, and only ahout .20 after two decades. The persistence of deviations
from the equations seemed to he less under floating exchange rates than under
fixed exchange rates and least across the change in regimes.

To the extent that the deviations

from our structural relationships

represent departures from sustainable long—term relationships, they might he
expected to influence trade flows. We

find

that, in fact, a high price level,

— 34 —

relative

to the norm, was consistently associated with a decline in exports

relative to imports over the next decade or two, although many of the coefficients were not significant. The relationship was much weaker and more erratic, however, over three—year intervals.

We do not imagine that the last word has been said on the specification of the structural equation. The next steps include a search for explanations of the residuals to the structural equations. As suggested, short—run
influences may be expected to account for some of the deviations of actual PLs
from those predicted by the structural equations. Their inclusion might
improve the estimates of the structural equations as well as help to explain
the deviations from them. The deviations that persist over many years, found
in this paper for a number of countries, may prove to be explicable in terms
of long—run
have

factors as yet unidentified. Finally, the residuals appear to

economic consequences, such as those on trade flows that deserve to be

investigated further.
