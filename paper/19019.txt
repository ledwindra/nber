Offshore jurisdictions (including Cyprus), corruption money laundering and Russian round-trip
investment

NBER Working Paper No. 19019
May 2013
JEL No. F21,F23
ABSTRACT
In this paper we analyze the link between corruption money laundering and round-trip investment
via offshore jurisdictions utilizing Russian firm-level data. In particular we empirically explore location
strategies of round-trip investors (namely, from Cyprus and British Virgin Islands) across Russia and
compare them with the benchmark group of genuine foreign investors in Russia. We further study
the determinants of the fraction of round-trip investment in total foreign investment in Russian regions.
We find that round-trip investors tend to locate in more corrupt Russian regions than their genuine
foreign counterparts and the fraction of round-trip investment is also significantly higher in corrupt
regions. Taking into account that a large fraction of round-trip investment in Russia is concentrated
in real estate and financial sectors, our results point to the conclusion that there is a strong link between
round-trip investment and corruption money laundering.

1. INTRODUCTION

Corruption has obvious connection with money laundering. As it is argued in Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) report 2011 “the stolen assets of a corrupt public official are useless unless they are placed,
layered, and integrated into the global financial network in a manner that does not raise suspicion”. It is
further argued in the report that corrupt public officials would seek to move financial proceeds of corruption
outside of their home jurisdiction. An examination of the corruption case studies revealed that in nearly
every case foreign bank accounts were being used in part of the scheme. The proceeds of corruption may be
laundered in jurisdictions which have not enacted strict anti-money laundering measures and in countries
which uphold very strict bank secretary laws or regulations (Rossidou-Papakyriacou, 1999). Offshore
financial centers are widely recognized as such jurisdictions.
Corruption money laundering in offshore financial centers is further connected with another largely
unexplored phenomenon in the world economy – round-trip investment, i.e. the transfer of funds abroad in
order to bring some or all of the investment back to home country as foreign investment. E.g. as has been
recently noted in press: “Most foreign investment in BRICs isn`t foreign at all – it`s tycoons using tax
havens”1. Each BRIC country has its own offshore jurisdiction largely used for capital round-tripping. For
China it is the tiny “bolthole” of the British Virgin Islands, for India – Mauritius, for Russia – Cyprus and for
Brazil – the Netherlands.
The consequences of such round-trip investment for national economies can be quite dramatic. E.g.
in China the bulk of these round-trip investments is from shell companies, which are registered by corrupt
Chinese officials in offshore jurisdictions. Since round-trip investment mainly flows to real estate
speculation, it distorts China`s entire economic structure2.
Though there are numerous journalist articles and opinions of leading economic analysts and
politicians on the link between corruption money laundering and round-trip investment via offshore
jurisdictions, this issue is practically unexplored in academic literature. In this paper we empirically analyze
the link between corruption money laundering and round-trip investment utilizing Russian firm-level data.

A distinctive feature of foreign investment patterns for Russia is the correlation of inward and
outward investment flows between Russia and key offshore financial centers (OFCs) such as Cyprus and
British Virgin Islands (BVI)3. According to Russian statistics, the key offshore destinations of Russian
registered capital outflows, Cyprus and BVI, are persistently among the major source countries of inward
foreign investment into Russia. And as in accordance to Perez et al. (2012) study over 20% FDI to money
laundering countries from a selection of transition countries were made to facilitate illicit money flows, it is
plausible to suggest that there should be a strong relationship between corruption money laundering and
round-trip investment in Russia.
In empirical test we utilize a sample of firms with foreign ownership that have been registered in
Russia during the period 1997-2011. The data comes from ROSSTAT – the Russian State Statistical Agency
– the most reliable data source of economic statistics on Russia.
In this study we consider two groups of foreign investors. The first one is represented by foreign
investors from Cyprus and British Virgin Islands, i.e. the OFCs which are very popular with round-tripping
activities of Russians. The second, benchmark group for comparison, consists of genuine foreign investors
and includes investors from such countries as Germany, Sweden, Finland and USA among the others.
First, using knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise of Carr et al. (2001), we provide a
formal (empirical) analysis of the phenomenon of round-trip investment in the Russian economy. In
particular we find very strong evidence that the amounts of foreign investment into Russia from Cyprus and
BVI cannot be explained within traditional international investment theory which confirms round-trip
investment hypothesis.
Second, we empirically study the differences in location strategies between round-trip and genuine
foreign investors across Russian regions. Here we find rather convincing evidence that round-trip investors
tend to invest into Russian regions with higher levels of resource potential and corruption. The explanation
for the result for resource potential is two-fold. On the one hand it points to the restrictions for genuine
foreign investment in Russian resource sector. On the other hand it reflects the circulation of money earned
3

According to the most popular and recognized definition, OFC is a centre which provides some or all of the following services: low or zero
taxation; moderate or light financial regulation; banking secrecy and anonymity. Though in general both Cyprus and BVI satisfy this definition, we
should mention that Cyprus’s future as an offshore financial centre has been in serious jeopardy when the island adopted full EU membership in
2004. However, due to cleverly adjusted taxation policies in the interests of corporations and foreign retirees, Cyprus remained an offshore tax haven
of some note. Source: http://www.shelteroffshore.com/index.php/offshore/more/positive-developments-cyprus-offshore-financial-centre-10519

by Russians in exploitation and export of natural resources via OFCs. The reasons of such circulation might
include tax avoidance (on profits from export of natural resources).
The result for corruption holds both in manufacturing and combined real estate and financial activities
sectors. However, we argue that the explanations can be different. On the one hand, for manufacturing sector
the preference of round-trip investors to locate in more corrupt Russian regions might reflect their better
abilities to deal with corrupt Russian regional authorities. On the other hand, the result that round-trip
investors tend to establish firms in real estate and financial sectors in more corrupt regions, in our view, just
reflects the corruption money laundering via round-trip investment hypothesis as these sectors are largely
associated with corruption.
Third, we empirically analyze the factors which determine the fraction of round-trip investment in
total foreign investment across Russian regions. Here we find very strong evidence that the share of roundtrip investment is considerably higher in more corrupt Russian regions. This result holds for all main
industrial sectors and gives further support for corruption money laundering hypothesis.
In general our empirical results give a strong support that round-trip investment is an important
channel of corruption money laundering in Russia. This suggests that offshore jurisdictions indirectly
facilitate corruption in the world economy. The existence of such jurisdictions makes the process of
laundering of money earned in dishonest activities (corruption or criminal) considerably easier.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 and 3 describe the data and empirical methodology,
respectively. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, section 5 discusses the results and concludes.

2. DATA DESCRIPTION
Our empirical analysis makes use of Rosstat (Russian State Statistical Agency) dataset,
which provides information on the location choice of 20,165 firms with foreign capital registered in
Russia in the period between 1997 and 2011 and provided financial reports to Rosstat in 2011. This
dataset includes information on firms of two ownership types: full ownership of foreign entities and
joint ventures of foreign owners (foreign entities and foreign citizens) with Russian private owners
(Russian entities and citizens). For each firm, we use data that Rosstat records on:

5



Industry information, including the six-digit OKVED code (Russian equivalent to SIC sixdigit codes) of the primary industry in which a firm operates;



Ownership structure, including information about firms` owners (country of origin,
company`s name, share in capital) and ownership status;



Location information, including a region;



Year of registration;



Charter capital size at the moment of registration;



Annual gross revenues in the period of 1998-2011 (when available).
From this dataset we extract two types of firms. First group consists of firms which foreign

ownership is represented by offshore owners (i.e. OFCs). In this study the offshore owners are
represented by investors from Cyprus and BVI. We assume that this group represents round-trip
investors. The second group consists of firms for which foreign ownership is represented by
genuine foreign owners. The genuine foreign (non-offshore) owners are more diversified: main
investors are Germany, USA, Finland, China, Turkey, France and Sweden. We should note here
that we do not include firms established by investors from Netherlands, Luxemburg, Liechtenstein,
Switzerland, Austria and Great Britain in either of these two groups. On the one hand, these
countries can be considered as offshore countries popular with Russian flight capital. On the other
hand, a large portion of foreign investment from these countries might have “real foreign” origin.
Our final sample consists of 15, 174 firms (5,712 (38 %) firms are established by investors
from Cyprus; 1,688 (11 %) – by investors from BVI and 7,774 (51%) – by genuine foreign
investors). More than 70% of firms are concentrated in three sectors: trade and repair (28,5%), real
estate (29%) and manufacturing industries (12, 7%). On figure 1 we present the distributions of
firms in these sectors (plus financial sector due to its popularity with round-trip investors) by origin
of foreign investor.

As we can see around 70% of firms in manufacturing industries and around 67% - in trade
and repair sector - are established by genuine foreign investors. On the other hand around 70% of
firms in real estate sector and around 80% of firms in financial sector are established by round-trip
investors. This evidence already reflects a corruption nature of round-trip investment as real estate
and financial sectors are commonly associated with corruption money laundering.
In manufacturing sector, around 18% of Cypriot firms are established in manufacturing of food and
beverages, around 11% - in chemical production and around 9% - in publishing and polygraphic activities.
Around 22% of BVI firms are established in manufacturing of food and beverages, around 16% - in
publishing and polygraphic activities and around 9% - in wood processing and manufacturing goods from
wood, except furniture. Finally around 15% of firms established by genuine foreign investors are in
manufacturing of machine and equipment, around 11% - in manufacturing of food and beverages and around
9% - in manufacturing of non-metallic mineral goods.

On figure 2 we present the structure of established firms by average annual gross revenues

Micro and small firms strongly dominate in our sample. This pattern is slightly stronger for
firms established by genuine foreign investors. There can be several explanations for this fact. First,
small firms are more flexible than larger ones to changing environment in an unstable transition
economy. Second, establishing small firms requires fewer permissions, bureaucracy work, etc. than
for larger firms which might be also important for investors in such a corrupt and bureaucratic
country like Russia. The largest firms are established in trade sector followed by manufacturing and
financial sectors. The relative patterns do not differ much between the groups of investors except
that round-trip investors establish significantly larger firms in the financial sector compared to
genuine foreign investors.

8

Both round-trip and genuine foreign investments are highly concentrated in three Russian
regions, namely, Moscow city, Saint-Petersburg city and Moscow region. 65% of firms established
by investors from Cyprus are registered in Moscow city, 13% - in Moscow region and 7% - in
Saint-Petersburg. The corresponding shares for BVI are 76, 10 and 7% and for genuine foreign
investors – 56, 12 and 12%. The dominance of established firms in Moscow city is partly explained
by the fact that companies have their head offices in Moscow but real production activities are
located in regions. Unfortunately, from our data we cannot separate those firms that conduct real
business in other regions but locate in Moscow.
On figure 3 we plot the number of firms established by round-trip investors (Cyprus and
BVI) against the number of firms established by genuine foreign investors across Russian regions.
We exclude Moscow, Moscow region and St. Petersburg because of scale problem.

Note: X – Round-trip investors; Y – Genuine foreign investors.

From the figure we can see that though there is positive relationship in distribution of the
two types of firms across Russian regions, it is far from being perfectly identical (i.e. 45 degree
line). This evidence indicates that there are substantial differences in location strategies between
round-trip and genuine foreign investors across Russia.

3. EMPIRICAL STRATEGIES

3.1. Knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise frameworks
First, we estimate the knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise suggested by Carr et al.
(2001) with offshore dummies (adapted to our case of one host country (Russia) and multiple home
countries). We suggest that if offshore dummies are statistically significant and positive, then foreign
investments from OFCs exceeds the amounts predicted by traditional economic theory which gives support
for round-trip investment hypothesis (similar approach has been used by Rose and Spiegel (2007)). The
updated model is as follows:

RSALES j ,t   0  1SUMGDPjRUS ,t   2GDPDIFFSQ jRUS ,t   3 SKDIFF jRUS ,t 

 4GDPDIFFjRUS ,t * SKDIFF jRUS ,t   5 INVCRUSt   6TCRUS t   7TCRUS t * SKDIFFSQ jRUS ,t (1)
  8TCJ j ,t   9 DISTANCE jRUS  10OFFD  11OFF 2  u j  e jt

where RSALES j ,t is the sum of real annual gross revenues of firms established by foreign investors from a
parent country j in a year t (2002,…,2011). SUMGDPjRUS ,t is the sum of GDP of a parent country j and
Russia in a year t. GDPDIFF jRUS ,t is the difference between GDP of a parent country j and GDP of Russia
in a year t. GDPDIFFSQ jRUS ,t is the squared GDPDIFF jRUS ,t . Annual gross revenues values which are
originally in Russian roubles and GDP values of all countries have been converted into 2005 US dollars
using an exchange rate adjusted local wholesale price index with exchange rates and price indices taken from
the International Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International Monetary Fund.
The variable SKDIFF jRUS ,t is a measure of skilled labour abundance in a country j relative to Russia
in a year t. SKDIFFSQ jRUS ,t is the squared SKDIFF jRUS ,t . Skilled labour abundance is measured by Gross
Enrolment Ration (tertiary (ISCED 5 and 6)) of the World Bank database.

10

INVCRUS t and TCRUS t respectively measure costs of investing in, and exporting to, Russia in a
year t. TCJ j ,t measures trade costs in exporting to parent country j in a year t. Investment costs in Russia are
measured by Investment dimension of the Index of Economic Freedom of the Heritage Foundation. Trade
costs in Russia and parent countries are measured by taxes on international trade (% of revenues) of the
World Bank database. Taxes on international trade include import duties, export duties, profits of export or
import monopolies, exchange profits, and exchange taxes.
Finally, to the baseline model we add two dummy variables. The first one, OFFD, equals to one for
Cyprus and BVI and zero otherwise. The second one, OFF2, equals to one for Austria, Liechtenstein,
Luxemburg, Netherlands and Great Britain and zero otherwise. The latter variable counts for the countries
which can be partly considered as popular with round-tripping activities of Russian investors.
We estimate the equation (1) using panel data model with random effects. We do not use fixed
effects because our main variables of interest – two offshore dummies – are time-invariant and thus
subsumed by regional fixed effects.

3.2. Location model framework: three dimensional panel data framework
The aim of our empirical analysis within location model framework is to determine if and to what extent the
role of regional factors in the location decisions of foreign investors across Russian regions differs between
round-trip and genuine foreign investors. More precisely, we estimate the following equation:

yitj   0  1 RESi ,t 1   2Corri   3 Porti   4 MSizei ,t 1   5 Mpoti ,t 1   6 RIRi ,t 1

19 Roadsi ,t 1 * OFFd j    tYear _ Dummies  ui  eit
t

where yitj is the number of established firms in a particular Russian region, i (i=1,…,76), in a given year, t
(t=1997,…,2010) by a j (1,2) type of investor (round-trip and genuine foreign). Hence, we deal with threedimensional panel data. The explanatory variables are described below in subsection 4.2.1; the time-varying

11
control variables are lagged by one year. The use of lagged explanatory variables helps to solve possible
endogeneity problems and further relate to a simple hypothesis for the foreign investor`s decision-making
process: foreign investors are assumed to make an investment decision for a given year by referring to the
observable variables of the previous year (see, e.g., Ledyaeva, 2009).
We also include an offshore dummy OFFd which equals to one for round-trip investors (Cyprus and
BVI in this study) and zero for their genuine foreign counterparts. We further include the interaction terms
between OFFd and all the explanatory variables in order to estimate the differences in the role of regional
factors in location decisions between round-trip and genuine foreign investors.
Finally, we include time (year) dummies. ui is unobserved regional heterogeneity and e it is
idiosyncratic error.

3.2.1.

Explanatory variables

RES, the natural resources` potential variable, is measured using an online Expert RA journal4 ranking5 for a
particular region, i, in a given year, t-1 (from 1 to 89/83: 1 corresponds to the highest potential and 89/83
corresponds to the lowest potential).
Corruption CORR in a Russian region i is measured using the corruption dimension provided by the
Moscow Carnegie Center`s Index of Democracy for the period 2000-2004 (as average). It is measured on a
5-point scale, where 1 indicates the highest level of corruption and 5 indicates the lowest. This indicator
refers mainly to state corruption in a broader sense, that is, the interconnections between political and
business elites and their interventions in the political decision-making process. To our knowledge, this is the
only indicator of corruption that is available for all of the Russian regions.6
The variable Port reflects the presence of a seaport in a particular Russian region (a dummy variable
that is equal to one if there is at least one sea port in a region and zero otherwise).
MSize, the market size variable, is the first principal component of three variables (gross regional
product, total population, and population density) for a particular region, i (i=1,…,76), in a given year, t-1
4

http://www.raexpert.ru/ - official webpage of Expert Rating Agency (RA), the most respected rating agency in the CIS and Eastern Europe.

5

This indicator reflects the average weighted availability of balanced stocks of principal natural resources in the Russian regions.

6

The only alternative is the index of corruption of Transparency International and Fund INDEM (2002). However, the index was only computed for
40 Russian regions, which would pose serious limitation on our study.

12
(t=1996-2007). This indicator for the market size in Russian regions was introduced previously in a study by
Iwasaki and Suganuma (2005). The proportion of variance of the first component can reach 80%, and
furthermore, its eigenvector and component loading show that this variable is suitable as a general index of
market size.
We also include a surrounding-market potential variable, MPot (see Blonigen et al., 2007). For a
region, i, it is defined as the sum of the market sizes (measured using the MSize variable) of the surrounding
regions within a distance of 500 km (between the capital of a particular Russian region and the capital of a
neighbouring (but not necessarily bordering) region). This distance threshold between neighbouring regions
has been chosen based on the “trial-and-error” method. This variable is also lagged by one year.
Regional investment risk, RIR, is an online Expert RA journal ranking7 ranging from 1 to 89/83 for a
particular Russian region, i, in a given year, t-1 (1 is assigned to a region with the smallest risk in Russia, and
89/83 is assigned to a region with the largest risk).
The next variable is the educational background of population in a Russian region, EDU. It is
measured using a natural logarithm of the share of population with at least a medium level of professional
education compared to the share of population with no professional education in a particular Russian region
in the year 2002 (the data comes from the Rosstat Population Census for 2002).
Regional institutional potential, RIP, is an online Expert RA journal ranking8 ranging from 1 to 89/83
for a particular Russian region, i, in a given year, t-1 (1 is assigned to a region with the highest potential in
Russia, and 89/83 is assigned to a region with the lowest potential).
Finally, the variable Roads reflects the regional development of railways and highways and is
measured by the average density of railways and highways in a particular region, i, in a given year, t-1.

3.2.2.

Econometric methodology

The dependent variable in the location model is a count variable, and it takes on only non-negative
integer values. While a Poisson regression is appropriate for modeling the count data, our data is
significantly overdispersed, and hence, it violates a basic assumption of the Poisson model (Hausman, Hall,
7
This is a qualitative indicator that simultaneously reflects political, economic, social, criminal, financial, ecological, and legislative risks for
investment activities in the Russian regions.

This indicator reflects the level of development of principal market institutions in the Russian regions.

13
and Griliches, 1984). Consequently, as recommended in the literature, we use negative binomial (NB)
regression to model the count data (Hausman et al., 1984). Since our data has a panel structure, we estimate
equation (1) using a negative binomial panel model. The negative binomial panel estimator accommodates
the explicit control of persistent, individual, unobserved effects through either fixed or random effects. We
employ regional random effects to control for unobserved regional differences. We do not use fixed effects
for two reasons. First, several our explanatory variables are time-invariant and thus subsumed by regional
fixed effects. Second, the maximum likelihood estimation – implemented using STATA – failed to converge
with the inclusion of region-specific dummies. The reason for this is that the Newton-Raphson method used
to estimate the likelihood functions in STATA is sensitive to the number of variables (see also Hedge and
Hicks, 2008). We also include year dummies to control for unobserved systematic period effects.
The distribution of our dependent variable also contains a large number of zeros – nearly 31% for the
whole sample and up to 60% for subsamples. This suggests that our data may contain excess zeros relative to
the data generated using a standard negative binomial process. Failure to account for these extra zeros may
result in biased parameter estimates (Lambert, 1992). Accordingly, we also estimated equation (2) using a
zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model. Because we could not find a panel data version of the ZINB
model in the existing econometrics literature (see also Basu et al., 2011, p. 167), we employed a standard
ZINB estimator and computed standard errors that are robust for both clustering within regions and
heteroscedasticity. We should also mention that the ZINB model maximum likelihood estimation,
implemented in STATA, similar to the ordinary negative binomial model mentioned in the previous
paragraph, failed to converge when region-specific dummies (fixed effects) were included due to a
collinearity problem and an excessive number of explanatory variables. Hence, when using the ZINB model,
we estimated the reduced form of equation (1) by excluding ui , unobserved regional heterogeneity.
The ZINB model assumes that the population is characterized by two regimes: One where members
are “not at risk,” and thus always have zero counts, and another where members are “at risk,” and thus have
either zero or positive counts (Greene, 2000). The likelihood of being in either regime is estimated using
logit specification, while the counts in the second regime are estimated using a negative binomial
specification. Potentially, the same set of explanatory variables can be used in each stage of the process

14
(Basile, 2004). After different attempts, however, a subset of variables was selected to specify the splitting
function: Corr, Msize, RIP and Roads.

3.3. Fractional dependent variable model framework
At this stage we analyze the regional factors of the fraction of round-trip investment in total investment
across Russian regions. In particular we estimate the following equation:

FRTit   0  1 RES it   2 Corri   3 Port i   4 Msizeit   5 Mpot it 

 6 RIRit   7 EDU i   8 RIPit   9 Roadsit  Year _ Dummies  eit

(3)

where FRTit is a fraction of the sum of gross annual revenues earned by firms with foreign ownership of
investors from Cyprus and BVI in the total sum of gross annual revenues earned by all firms with foreign
ownership (i.e. the sum of two considered groups in our study) in a Russian region i (1,…,76) in a year t
(2002,…,2011). At this stage we consider only firms established in the period of 1997-2001; i.e. the number
of firms is fixed for the analyzed period (2002-2011). The explanatory variables are the same as in location
model.
We utilize a fractional logit pooled data model to estimate the equation (3) as recommended in the
relevant literature (for details see Papke and Wooldridge (1996; 2008)).

As we can see, both offshore dummies are highly statistically significant and have positive signs in
the whole sample and all the industrial subsamples which give strong support that these countries invest
significantly more into Russia than can be explained within the knowledge-capital model. Furthermore,
offshore dummy for Cyprus and BVI is significantly larger by magnitude than the offshore dummy for
Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Netherlands and Great Britain which indicates the higher importance of
the former countries as the centers for round-tripping activities of Russian investors. It can be also noted that
knowledge-capital model performs much better when the offshore dummies are included which further
points to the importance of analyzing the phenomenon of round-trip investment in the context of Russian
economy.

Baseline specification

In table 2 we present estimation results of the random effects negative binomial (RENB) panel data model
and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model for the whole sample. We also present estimation results
of equation (2) separately for the subsamples of round-trip and genuine foreign investors (then offshore
dummy and its interactions vanish) and for pooled data when the offshore dummy and its interaction terms
with explanatory variables are not included. Basic descriptive statistics and correlation matrix are presented
in Appendix 1. Here and after we do not report the results for the inflation stage of ZINB estimations for
space reasons and make them available upon request.

From the results we can see that both round-trip and genuine foreign investors establish more firms
in Russian regions with larger market size, higher institutional potential, higher educational background of
population and better transport infrastructure (represented by railways and highways).

18
For the resource potential and port variables we find opposite results for the two groups of investors.
In particular, according to our findings, round-trip investors tend to establish more firms in Russian regions
with higher resource potential, while their genuine foreign counterparts – with lower resource potential. This
result might reflect restrictions for foreign investment in the Russian resource sector which are not applied to
(or can be easily overcome by) round-trip investors who are Russians by origin.
We also find that while the presence of a sea port in a region stimulates genuine foreign investment
into it, it is not an important factor of location decision of round-trip investors. We suggest that this indicates
a higher orientation of round-trip investors towards the local market (both in inward and backward linkages)
compared to their genuine foreign counterparts.
From the results for interaction terms with offshore dummy we further conclude that there are
significant differences between location strategies of round-trip and genuine foreign investors. In particular
we find that round-trip investors establish more firms than their genuine foreign counterparts in resource
abundant Russian regions, regions with larger market size, regions with higher institutional potential, regions
without sea ports and regions with lower educational background of population.
The result for regional resource potential variable indicates that round-trip investors win genuine
foreign investors in competition for natural resources. This result is expected. Round-trip investors being
Russians by origin have better knowledge and connections with local business networks and regional
authorities. These business networks and regional authorities play a crucial role in gaining access to natural
resources. Moreover round-trip investors might be themselves full or partial owners of Russian companies in
resource-based industries (e.g. they utilize offshore schemes to hide export revenues from local taxes) and
hence, round-trip investment is simply the reinvestment of their incomes into the same company and region
(e.g. in case of using offshore tax evasion schemes in export operations).
The finding that round-trip investors establish more firms than their genuine foreign counterparts in
Russian regions with larger market size indicates that round-trip investment is more oriented towards local
markets compared to genuine foreign. Furthermore this might also indicate that genuine foreign investors
tend to export goods produced in Russia rather than sell them at local market.
The finding that round-trip investors establish fewer firms than genuine foreigners in regions with
sea ports also has a plausible explanation (which is quite related to the explanation for the interaction with

19
market size variable). As sea port is a convenient mean for international transportation, this result enables us
to suggest that genuine foreign investors more often than round-trip investors rely on imported intermediate
goods and export the produced goods to home or third countries.
The result that round-trip investors establish more firms than genuine foreigners in Russian regions
with lower educational potential indicates that genuine foreign investment is more qualified labour intensive
than round-trip investment.

4.2.2.

Micro versus small, medium and large firms

As has been shown in Section 2 (data description) around 50% of firms in our dataset are micro firms
according to the Russian classification of company`s size (with annual gross revenues less than 1.5 million
Euros). In order to determine if foreign investors pursue different location strategies in Russia when
establishing firms of different size we estimate the location model for subsamples of micro firms and bigger
firms (small, medium and large altogether according to the Classification). The estimation results of equation
(2) are presented in table 3. The estimation period ends in 2008 as there are only few firms established in the
years 2009, 2010 and 2011 which reported annual gross revenues.

In general the results do not differ much from the baseline and between the subsamples. However, we have
mixed results for the corruption variable. In particular for bigger firms (i.e. when micro firms are excluded)
we find that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in less corrupt Russian regions compared to their
round-trip counterparts. This result could be expected. But for micro firms we found an opposite and
unexpected result that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in more corrupt Russian regions and
furthermore they invest more into more corrupt Russian regions compared to round-trip investors.

21
After checking the structure of firms in our data by country we found that many firms established by
investors from developing and transition economies are micro firms. As a rule these countries are much more
corrupt than developed ones. Investors from corrupt countries may be more equipped to cope with corruption
(Cuervo-Cazurra, 2006), and, hence, they may have a competitive advantage over investors from non-corrupt
countries when entering corrupt economies. In our earlier study using the same database as in this paper we
also found that foreign investors from more corrupt countries tend to establish firms in more corrupt Russian
regions (Ledyaeva et al. forthcoming). To account for this issue we estimate our model excluding from the
genuine investors` group firms established by investors from developing and transition countries. The results
are presented in the last two columns of Table 3. As we can see the unexpected result for corruption

variable in the sample of micro firms disappears: the coefficients of the corruption variable and its
interaction term with offshore dummy are not statistically significant anymore. Moreover, in the
subsample of bigger firms the result that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in less
corrupt Russian regions becomes stronger.

1.1.1.

Industrial patterns

Next we estimate our location model for two sectors of the Russian economy, namely, manufacturing and
combined financial and real estate sectors. We focus on these sectors because the first one largely reflects the
real sector of the economy and its development is an important issue for Russian economy. The second one
might be associated with corruption which is the main focus of this paper. The estimation results are
presented in table 4. Here we use cross-sectional data as in panel data the number of zeros is extremely high
and it is impossible to get reliable estimates even with zero-inflated models. For estimation purposes we
utilize Poisson and negative binomial (NB) models.

Results` discussion
Manufacturing sector
First, as in estimations for the whole sample we find that in the subsample of bigger manufacturing firms
genuine foreign investors invest more into less corrupt regions compared to round-trip investors.
Second, for the subsample of micro firms we find that round-trip investors tend to establish more
firms in regions with higher resource potential compared to their genuine foreign counterparts. This indicates
that round-trip investors invest more than genuine foreigners into resource-based manufacturing industries
which further confirm that they have better access to Russian natural resources than genuine foreign
investors.
The interaction term of market size and offshore dummy is also positive and statistically significant
indicating that round-trip investors invest more into regions with larger market size compared to genuine
foreign investors. This result indicates that manufacturing firms established by round-trip investors are more

23
likely to sell their goods at local (Russian) market while genuine foreign investors have higher propensity to
export produced products.
We also find evidence (albeit marginally statistically significant) that in the subsample of bigger
firms round-trip investors establish fewer firms in the regions with sea port compared to genuine foreign
investors. This result indicates that in manufacturing sector firms established by genuine foreign investors
are more oriented towards import of intermediate goods and export of produced products.
Finally, we find that both round-trip and genuine foreign investors tend to invest into regions with
higher institutional potential and higher density of automobile and railway roads.

Financial and real estate sector
First, for larger firms, the coefficient of the interaction term between offshore dummy and corruption
variable is statistically significant and its sign indicates that round-trip investors establish more firms in more
corrupt regions compared to genuine foreigners. And as this is widely accepted that financial and real estate
activities are largely associated with corruption money laundering, this result might reflect the corruption
money laundering hypothesis of round-trip investment in Russia.
Second, for the subsample of larger firms the interaction term between offshore dummy and port
variable is statistically significant and its sign indicates that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in
regions with sea port compared to round-trip investors. This indicates that financial activities of genuine
foreign investors might be largely associated with export-import transport operations.
There is also evidence that in the subsample of micro firms genuine foreign investors establish more
firms in regions with higher educational potential of population compared to round-trip investors.
Preliminary we suggest that this result indicates that genuine foreigners tend to establish financial and real
estate firms in regions with more developed service sector (which might be partly reflected by higher
educational potential of population).
Finally we find that market size, institutional potential and transport infrastructure are important
location factors for both genuine foreign and round-trip investment.

First, the share of round-trip activities is higher in corrupt Russian regions. This result is highly
statistically significant in the whole sample and in both industrial subsamples. The result has been expected
and in general confirms that 1) round-trip investors are better equipped to cope with corruption than their
genuine foreign counterparts and 2) round-trip investment might be an important channel for corruption
money laundering in Russia.
Second, we find that the share of round-trip investment is lower in regions with ports. A similar
result has been found in the location model. Hence, our conclusion that round-trip investors are more
oriented towards local (Russian) market than genuine foreign investors is reinforced.
Fourth, the results for educational background of population are mixed. First, in manufacturing and
combined financial and real estate sector the fraction of round-trip investment is higher in regions with
higher educational background of population. We argue that though the result is the same for these two

25
sectors, the explanations might be different. In particular, while in manufacturing industry it can be largely
explained by the need of local qualified personnel, in combined financial and real estate sector, educational
background of population might reflect a better development of the service sector in general. However, in the
whole sample we find that the share of round-trip activities is higher in regions with lower educational
background of population. In our preliminary estimations we found that this result for the whole sample
largely reflects the result for trade and repair sector. In general it might point to the higher technological
level of genuine foreign investment compared to round-trip investment in this sector.

5. CONCLUSIONS
This paper sheds light on a virtually unexplored phenomenon: round-trip investment from Russia to offshore
financial centers and back to Russia. In particular we empirically study the link between corruption and
round-trip investment. Our empirical test is based on the firm-level data on foreign-owned firms in Russia
obtained from Rosstat. Our main results can be summarized as follows.
First, we find quite robust evidence that round-trip investors tend to invest into more corrupt Russian
regions than genuine foreign investors. This result gives support for the proposition of laundering the
proceeds of corruption via round-trip investment (in particular it’s high significance for the combined
financial and real estate sector). It further indicates that round-trip investors may indeed be better equipped to
cope with institutional deficiencies, e.g., corruption (in particular, the result`s significance in manufacturing
sector).
Second, we find evidence that round-trip investors invest more into regions with higher resource
potential compared to their genuine foreign counterparts. This finding indicates that round-trip investors are
better able to exploit the business opportunities provided by the Russian natural resources than genuine
foreign investors. This often requires allying with authorities, which is obviously easier for round-trip
investors than for genuinely foreign investors. Furthermore, round-trip investors might be themselves the
representatives of the authorities who already have access to resources.
Finally, our results enable us to suggest that round-trip investors favor the development of the Dutch
disease in Russia. In particular they are very highly concentrated in the service sector (real estate and
financial activities, in particular), seem to aim at exploiting natural resources in Russia, tend to establish

26
manufacturing firms in resource-based industries and support the development of corruption in Russia by
investing into corrupt Russian regions. On the contrary, genuine foreign investments seem to work against
the Dutch disease as they are more concentrated in manufacturing industries and regions with higher
educational potential of population but are not tied to resource abundant and corrupt Russian regions.
