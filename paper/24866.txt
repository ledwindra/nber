The Run on Repo and the Fed's Response

ABSTRACT
The Financial Crisis began and accelerated in short-term money markets. One such market is the
multi-trillion dollar sale-and-repurchase (“repo”) market, where prices show strong reactions
during the crisis. The academic literature and policy community remain unsettled about the role
of repo runs, because detailed data on repo quantities is not available. We provide quantity
evidence of the run on repo through an examination of the collateral brought to emergency
liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve. We show that the magnitude of repo discounts
(“haircuts”) on specific collateral is related to the likelihood of that collateral being brought to
Fed facilities.

Introduction

The panics of the Global Financial Crisis took place outside of the traditional banking system. The
largest institutions to fail or nearly fail—Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG—were not traditional
banks. Furthermore, the stress in the traditional-bank lending markets in late 2008 were preceded
by turmoil in lightly regulated short-term money markets: sale and repurchase agreements (repo),
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), structured investment vehicles (SIVs), collateralized debt
obligations (CDOs), and other acronymic products. These non-bank institutions and markets go
by a variety of names—shadow banking, market-based finance, securitized banking—but whatever
we call them the challenge is the same: we do not have anywhere near the data needed to fully
understand what happened.
This a major data gap, because an enormous new edifice of regulatory policy continues to be built
on highly incomplete information. This gap will not easily be filled: in many cases, the raw data was
simply not collected by anyone. Governments did not track—and in some cases stopped tracking—
some of the markets. Furthermore, since most of these markets are operated over-the-counter, there
are no centralized exchanges with comprehensive coverage. What we are left with is a hodgepodge
of information from market makers, industry surveys, and government emergency programs. To
make any progress, researchers must carefully combine these various sources. In this paper, we
attack this problem by merging two unique data sets: first, information about the quantities of
specific collateral used in Federal Reserve emergency programs and, second, trader supplied haircut
data on various categories of bonds. With this combined dataset, we provide important evidence
about the repo market, a major vector of crisis contagion.
Prior to the crisis, repo was a lightly regulated multi-trillion dollar market which funded nearly
half of the asset holdings by the major investment banks. In a repo contract a lender makes a
short term cash loan in exchange for collateral. The amount by which the loan is less than the
value of the collateral is called the haircut. For instance, a bond with $100 value and 10% haircut
will allow the borrower access to $90 in repo financing. An increase in the haircut for a type of
collateral, then, is economically equivalent to a reduction in the quantity of securitized borrowing
that can be done using a given amount of collateral. When repo contracts have short maturities,
such reductions in borrowing can look just like old-fashioned runs on banks. Gorton and Metrick
(2012) used evidence about haircut changes to infer such a “run on repo” during the crisis. But
haircuts represent only price evidence consistent with a run. In this paper, we document quantity
evidence of the run.
Repo is divided into two different markets: “tri-party repo” and “bilateral repo.” In tri-party
repo, a clearing bank stands between borrowers and lenders. Because the tri-party repo market is
dominated by regulated institutions, the data there is relatively complete.1 In contrast, bilateral

repo is the home of hedge funds, many types of offshore institutions, and other unregulated cash
pools. A 2004 industry survey found that bilateral repo was about three times as large as tri-party
repo (see discussion in Gorton and Metrick (2015)). The situation is similar post-crisis. Baklanova
et al. (2017) study a cross-section of bilateral repo transactions in the first quarter of 2015. They
find that “...more than half the trades in terms of dollar volume involve a bank or a broker-dealer,
followed by hedge funds. The results differ from that of tri-party repo, where the money market
funds and cash reinvestment arms of securities lending agents are the largest participants.”
Krishnamurthy et al. (2014) perform a careful study of repo quantities in the tri-party market and
conclude that any runs were limited. However, the evidence in Gorton and Metrick (2015) shows
that extrapolating from the tri-party market does not allow any inference for bilateral repo—
thus leaving more than half of the market unknown. To study quantity evidence of a run on
bilateral repo we exploit data from the emergency lending facilities set up by the Federal Reserve.
These facilities allowed borrowers to bring collateral to the Fed in exchange for cash or Treasuries.
Consistent with a run on repo, we show that an increase in haircuts on a given type of collateral in
the repo market resulted in these assets being brought to the Fed as collateral against emergency
loans. In a difference-in-differences setting, we use changes in bilateral repo haircuts to explain
bank-collateral-level borrowing from three facilities—the Term Auction Facility (TAF), the Term
Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). Our finding
is robust to including proxies for shocks to bank capital and counterparty risk.
We organize the paper as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the main features of the Fed emergency
lending facilities. Section 3 discusses lending data provided by the Fed, the bilateral haircut data,
and the merging of the two datasets. In Section 4 we present our empirical evidence: we show that
changes in haircuts on specific asset classes caused borrowers to take those assets to the facilities.
Section 5 concludes.

The Emergency Lending Facilities

During the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis the Federal Reserve introduced a number of temporary
emergency facilities to address pressures in various financial markets. At one point there were
nine temporary liquidity facilities in place.2 In this paper we focus on three important facilities—
the Term Auction Facility (TAF), the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), and the Primary
Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)—that allowed depository institutions or primary dealers to borrow
against collateral outside the usual discount window, and where detailed collateral data has been
made available by the Fed.
Table 1 and Figure 1 summarize the main characteristics of the three programs. The TSLF was a

security-for-security exchange. The borrower offered a bond as collateral, e.g., a mortgage-backed
security, and received a Treasury bond in exchange. The TAF and the PDCF, on the other hand,
lent cash against collateral. The TAF, like the regular discount window of the Federal Reserve,
was only available to depository institutions; the TSLF and the PDCF were both open to primary
dealers only. The PDCF, like the discount window, was a standing facility; the TAF and the TSLF
were auction facilities. A standing facility is usually viewed as being subject to stigma, which may
have limited the effectiveness of the PDCF. For more details on these programs, and concerns about
stigma, see Fleming (2012) and Armantier et al. (2012).
The TAF opened on December 12, 2007 and the final auction was held March 8, 2010. Since the
TAF was only open to depository institutions, the U.S. broker-dealers were excluded from using
it.3 Foreign banks with U.S. affiliates, however, were able to make use of the TAF. According to
Benmelech (2012) “foreign banks accounted for 58 percent of TAF lending, with a total amount
of $2.2 trillion, compared to $1.6 trillion for U.S. banks” (p. 4). Benmelech (2012) also notes
that most of the financial institutions that were eligible pledged asset-backed and mortgage-backed
securities (ABS), suggesting “that the meltdown of the structured finance market and the severe
deterioration in the credit ratings of ABSs necessitated liquidity...” (p. 5). TAF borrowing peaked
at nearly $500 billion in spring of 2009. We summarize the types of collateral brought to the
facilities in Table 2.
The TSLF was introduced on March 11, 2008, right before Bear Stearns was acquired by JP Morgan on March 16, 2008. The first auction took place on March 27, 2008. Schedule 1 collateral
(Treasuries, Agency MBS and Agency securities) auctions were suspended on July 1, 2009 and
Schedule 2 collateral (investment-grade securities plus Schedule 1 collateral) auctions were suspended on February 1, 2010. The TSLF was designed to alleviate stress in financing collateral
in money markets by allowing less-liquid, lower quality, collateral to be exchanged for Treasuries.
Since the TSLF was a security-for-security exchange it did not increase the size of the Fed balance
sheet and did not have to be sterilized. As a result, it could be increased in size quickly. TSLF
borrowing reached $150 billion in its first month, and nearly $250 billion in September 2008.
The PDCF was announced on March 16, 2008 and closed on February 1, 2010. The PDCF can be
thought of as simply an extension of the traditional discount window to allow access for non-bank
primary dealers: it shared many of the same rules and institional arrangements as the discount
window. At its peak in September 2008, total borrowing topped $150 billion. Adrian et al. (2009)
provide more detail on the PDCF.
There are further differences between the facilities. The maturity of PDCF borrowing was overnight
and the facility could be accessed daily. Maturities for borrowing from both the TAF and the TSLF
were longer. TAF loan maturities were 28-84 days, while TSLF maturities were 28 days. The PDCF

also accepted lower quality collateral than the TSLF.

2.1

Pricing

The three programs differed in how loans were priced and in how quantities were determined. Two
of the programs, the TAF and the TSLF, allocated loans by holding regularly scheduled auctions.
The third, the PDCF, was a standing facility. Figure 1 summarizes the rates paid and quantities
borrowed from each program.
Both the TAF and the TSLF used similar auction mechanisms. Before each auction the Fed
announced a maximum amount to be lent (the cap). Each eligible institution could submit up to
two bids specifying the interest rate they would be willing to pay for a given amount of Fed Funds
(in the case of the TAF) or Treasury collateral (in the case of the TSLF). The Fed then picked the
lowest rate such that the total borrowing would be at or below the announced cap. All participants
who received a loan paid this single rate on their borrowing. The Fed further imposed constraints
on the total amount of borrowing done by any single institution.
What should we expect the interest rates on emergency loans to look like? TAF borrowers received
Fed Funds (i.e., cash) in return for their collateral. Absent any risk or frictions in the Fed Funds
market we would therefore expect the rate paid on TAF loans to track the effective Fed Funds rate.
This is confirmed in Figure 1. The only exception is immediately after the Lehman failure when
rates on TAF loans spiked well above the funds rate. The TAF maxed out in all auctions prior
to the Lehman failure, after which the Fed increased the cap and the remaining auctions were all
under-subscribed.
TSLF borrowers, in contrast, received Treasuries. As with TAF auctions, the Fed adjusted the
borrowing cap in the TSLF auction-by-auction. Total borrowing was typically below the cap, with
the exception of auctions immediately following the Lehman failure. Naturally, the auctions where
the supply cap was binding were the ones where prices spiked.4
Unlike the auction-based facilities, the PDCF was a standing facility where each eligible institution
(primary dealer) could get financing at the Fed discount window rate. There was a further penalty
fee after 45 days of using the PDCF, but no daily cap. In the pre-crisis period the Fed discount
window rate was set at target Fed Funds rate plus 100 basis points. In an attempt to reduce the
stigma associated with borrowing from the discount window, the Fed reduced the prime rate spread
to 25 basis points in 3/16/2008, where it stayed through the time-period studied in this paper.
4

There is not a simple reference rate to compare to the TSLF rate. Outside extreme stress situations, we would
expect arbitrage to keep the rate near zero, which is what we observe.

5

2.2

Haircuts

The three programs also differed in the haircuts applied to various types of collateral. The TSLF
and the PDCF used a program-specific table, while the TAF used the discount window table. The
haircuts depended both on type of collateral as well as maturity.
Because the characteristics in the haircut tables are not identical to categories reported in the Fed
data we cannot calculate the exact haircuts applied to each type of collateral. We instead match the
reporting categories to Fed haircut data and find equal-weighted averages. Table 4 in the Appendix
shows that the average haircuts the Fed applied were small, and similar across the three programs.
Importantly for our empirical strategy, there were almost no changes in Fed haircuts in this sample
period. The TAF used a fixed table for the duration of the program. The TSLF did not change
haircuts within a category, but did expand the breadth of collateral eligible after the Lehman
failure. The PDCF was the only program that changed haircuts within a category of collateral.
However, the resulting haircut changes in terms of collateral categories used in our regressions are
small in magnitude (≈ 1%).

Data

Our empirical work studies bank-level changes in emergency borrowing from a given facility against
specific types of collateral as a function of the change in bilateral repo haircuts. In this section
we discuss data sources, and the data construction process. Specifically, we discuss the emergency
borrowing data provided by the Fed and its match to the bilateral haircut data.

3.1

Data Provided by the Fed

The Fed provides loan-level data for each of the three emergency facilities discussed above. For each
loan they report borrower bank name, loan date, clearing date, maturity date, interest rate, and
value of collateral submitted. The amount of collateral provided by the borrower is further broken
down by collateral type (Treasury, MBS, Corporate, Loans, etc.) and collateral rating (AAA, AA,
etc.). The two sets of categories are slightly different across the three programs, as evident in
the two panels of Table 2. These tables show the prevalence of various types of collateral in the
programs. Note that the totals over type and rating do not always add up to the same number.
This is because many types of collateral did not have a credit rating. In the case of the TAF, the
Fed data reports all collateral brought to the discount window, including collateral held against
standard discount window borrowing. The Appendix contains more detail on the Fed data.

3.2

Bilateral Haircut Data, Matching Haircuts to Fed Collateral Categories

We use the same bilateral repo haircut data as Gorton and Metrick (2012).5 The haircuts are
on transactions between high-quality dealer banks and would be higher for hedge funds and other
non-dealer counterparties.
In order to study the relationship between private-market repo haircuts and corresponding borrowing from the emergency facilities, we need to match private-market repo haircut data with the
borrowing data provided by the Fed. While the Fed collateral data is reported by both type and
rating of collateral, the categories in our private-market data are a mixture of collateral quality
and collateral type. Because of this incongruity we perform the regression analysis based on two
separate matches—one by collateral rating and the other by collateral type.
We seek to match each Fed collateral category to every repo haircut category that could contain
the collateral in question. In other words, we pick the haircut data categories so as to maximize
the probability that the true haircut is included in the match. This minimizes the probability of
missing a haircut change, but potentially introduces noise by including irrelevant haircut changes.
One observation in the regressions is the amount of borrowing from a specific facility against a given
type of collateral, normalized by bank size. The effective haircut used in the regressions is a simple
average of haircuts matched to that type of collateral. Note that a number of the Fed collateral
categories are matched to no haircut data. In most cases this is because these assets did not have
active repo markets, such as commercial loans or equity. In other cases—notably Treasuries—the
haircuts never increased from zero so there would be no right-hand-side variation to exploit in the
regressions.
The program-by-program match is reported in the Tables 1-3 of the Appendix. In the following we
briefly describe the quality of match for each program.

• TAF. The collateral type categories Commercial Loans, Commercial and Residential Mortgages, and Consumer Loans are the major categories not matched to haircut data. Overall,
39% of the outstanding collateral is matched to haircut data based on collateral type.
In terms of collateral rating categories, Other Investment Grade (22% of the collateral) and
Treasury/Agency (10% of the collateral) are not matched to haircut data, with 68% matched
to haircut data.
• TSLF. Here we have the best match with haircut data. The majority of borrowing was
collateralized by Agency and non-Agency MBS, both of which are matched to the haircut
data. Only Muni, Treasury, International, and Other are not matched, accounting for a total

of 4% of the collateral provided.
Similarly, only 5% of collateral outstanding is not matched by rating.
• PDCF. The unmatched collateral type categories Treasury, Equity, Municipal, and Other
represent an average of 51% of the collateral outstanding. An average of 58% of outstanding
collateral is matched by rating.

3.3

Matching Borrower Data

We match each borrower name to the corresponding bank holding company (if applicable.) We then
match the resulting holding company level borrowers to Bankscope identifiers, Bloomberg tickers,
and Markit CDS identifiers. We merge in total assets in 2007 from Bankscope, daily market cap
data from Bloomberg, and daily 5-year CDS rates from Markit. In all, 58% of the total loan
volume outstanding corresponds to borrowers that are have total assets, market cap, and CDS
data available.
We collapse borrowing from the TAF to the bank holding company level before matching to total
assets, CDS, and market cap data. TSLF and PDCF borrowing is reported on the broker-dealer
level.

3.4

Data Construction

As summarized in Table 1, the three programs operated on separate schedules. The PDCF was
accessible daily, the TSLF held weekly auctions, and the TAF loans held biweekly auctions. Correspondingly, we study borrowing from each program at the associated frequency: daily, weekly, or
biweekly.
For each program, we construct a borrower-collateral level panel data set of collateral brought to
the Fed. For each collateral category, we calculate the private-market repo haircut as the equalweighted average of all the matched repo haircuts. Because we have two separate haircut matches,
we end up with two borrower-collateral level panel data sets. In regression analysis we use the two
panels in parallel.
The timing in the regressions is contemporaneous. That is, we regress changes in bank-collateral
level borrowing on changes in the right hand side variables during the same daily, weekly, or
biweekly period. Because TAF auctions were held on Monday mornings we use the preceding two
weeks changes in the explanatory variables.
The Appendix provides more detail on the specifics of data available from the Fed, and our procedure of constructing the panel.

Empirical Results

We now turn to examining the determinants of the timing of specific collateral being pledged at
the various Federal Reserve emergency lending facilities by specific borrowers. We use the change
in haircuts on various asset classes in the bilateral repo market to see if these changes cause that
specific type of collateral to be pledged at emergency lending facilities.
Our empirical strategy is to use cross-sectional variation within collateral-specific haircuts to account for changes in borrowing from Fed facilities. We estimate regressions of the form
∆Amounti,j,t = βHC ∆Haircutj,t + βXi,t + βI ILehman ∆Haircutj,t Xi,t + βL I + i,j,t ,
where i indexes borrowers, j indexes collateral type, and t measures time at the appropriate intervals. I is a dummy variable equal to one on all dates on or after the Lehman bankruptcy of
September 15th, 2008. We include the most granular fixed effects possible on bank-collateral level.
Standard errors are clustered both on time and on borrower.
This main regression tests the hypothesis that emergency borrowing, by category, co-moves with
corresponding haircuts by category. The underlying mechanism for such co-movement comes from
market prices and borrowing constraints: if the market-based haircuts increase on a category of
assets, then the bank must fund the additional amount itself. For example, suppose that initially
there was a zero haircut so that a lender lent $100 and received a bond with a market value of $100
as collateral. If, the next day, haircuts for that type of bond rise to ten percent, then the bank
must return $10 to the lender. Where does this $10 come from? One possibility is to sell the bond
rather than fund it in the repo market (i.e., in a fire sale). Another possibility is to use the bond
as collateral (if it is eligible) and borrow from an emergency lending facility and repay the repo
lender.
The control variables Xi,t seek to allow for alternative explanations of emergency borrowing. First,
it could be that banks were driven to use emergency facilities because of shocks to equity value,
perhaps from decline in the value of MBS on their balance sheets. We allow for this channel by
including changes to each borrower’s market capitalization, measured as percentage change over
the August 2007 market cap. Second, banks could be borrowing from the facilities because they
had become wary of counterparty risk. We include the change in the Libor-OIS spread as a general
measure of counterparty risk, and the change in each bank’s five year CDS rate to measure each
borrower’s specific risk as perceived by the market.
Figure 2 shows the time series of aggregate market cap of borrowers in the sample, and the valueweighted CDS index. As we would expect, these two series are strongly negatively correlated during
the crisis. Figure 2 also plots the Libor-OIS spread, and the aggregate haircut index.

4.1

Bilateral Haircuts and Collateral Taken to Fed

Our results are summarized in Table 3. Here we are exploiting the full cross-sectional data available. Namely, the dependent variable measures the total change in total borrowing from a specific
program by a given bank in a given period, using a specific type of collateral. In order to maintain
comparability across banks we normalize borrowing in each category by the bank’s total assets in
2007. In other words, quantities on the left-hand-side are always expressed as shares of total assets
for the financial institution. Observations in each regression are weighted by bank size.
Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that changes in haircuts have strong explanatory power over
emergency borrowing after the Lehman failure, particularly in the case of the TSLF and the TAF.
For instance, consider the results in the third column of Table 3. The coefficient on the change in
the haircut interacted with the Lehman dummy is 22.7. This means that a 10% increase in haircuts
associated with a given collateral type would increase borrowing by 10% ∗ 22.7/1000 = 0.227% in
terms of the bank’s total assets in 2007. For example, Goldman Sachs’ total assets at the end of
2007 were $1,119,796 million, implying that the increase would result in an extra $2.5 billion of
that collateral type being taken to the TSLF over the week.

Conclusion

Ten years after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, there are still many open questions about
the panics of the Global Financial Crisis. Scholars of the crisis have identified several aspects
of short-term money markets as crucial to crisis propagation, but large data gaps prevent a full
understanding. To fill one important gap, we combine price data from private repo markets with
quantity data from emergency lending programs of the Federal Reserve. We use these data to
study whether the change in repo haircuts can be traced to changes in the collateral brought to
Fed programs. We find evidence of a strong relationship, thus supporting the run on repo as a
propagation mechanism in the crisis.

Table 3: Bank-Collateral Level Regressions Data from 12/21/2007 to 1/30/2009. Biweekly
regressions for TAF, weekly regressions for TSLF, and daily regressions for PDCF. The left hand side
variable is the change in amount borrowed by a given bank from a given program, collateralized
by a type of collateral, normalized by borrower total assets in 2007. Regression observations
weighted by borrower 2007 total assets. Standard errors in all specifications double-clustered by
corresponding time period and borrower. Fixed effects included on the borrower-collateral level.
The two regressions for each program reflect the haircut match on collateral rating and collateral
type, respectively.
