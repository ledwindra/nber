ABSTRACT
The 1918 Influenza Pandemic killed millions worldwide and hundreds of thousands in the United
States. This paper studies the impact of air pollution on pandemic mortality. The analysis
combines a panel dataset on infant and all-age mortality with a novel measure of air pollution
based on the burning of coal in a large sample of U.S. cities. We estimate that air pollution
contributed significantly to pandemic mortality. Cities that used more coal experienced tens of
thousands of excess deaths in 1918 relative to cities that used less coal with similar pre-pandemic
socioeconomic conditions and baseline health. Factors related to poverty, public health, and the
timing of onset also affected pandemic mortality. The findings support recent medical evidence on
the link between air pollution and influenza infection, and suggest that poor air quality was an
important cause of mortality during the pandemic.

The 1918 Influenza Pandemic was among the worst catastrophes in human history. The
virus infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide, one-third of the population. It killed at
least 50 million, more than all 20th century wars (Crosby 1989). In the U.S., more than 30
percent of the population was infected, and approximately 675,000 died (Crosby 1989). The
1918 Influenza Pandemic continues to be studied both as an extraordinary historical episode and
because of its implications for current policy. As Taubenberger and Morens (2006, p.15) put it:
“[u]nderstanding the 1918 pandemic and its implications for future pandemics requires careful
experimentation and in-depth historical analysis.”
In the U.S., the pandemic spread nationwide during September and October of 1918.
There were large regional differences in pandemic mortality, but little consensus has emerged
over the underlying causes of these mortality differences. Analysis of mortality rates in Chicago
and Hartford shows that mortality rates were related to markers of poverty such as the percent
foreign born, illiteracy, and homeownership (Tuckel et al. 2006; Grantz et al. 2016). Other
scholars argue that pandemic timing and proximity to World War I military bases influenced
severity (Sydenstricker 1918; Barry 2004; Byerly 2010). Bootsma and Ferguson (2007) and
Markel et al. (2007) present evidence that public health measures such as school closings,
cancelling of public meetings, and quarantines mitigated the effects. Still other researchers argue
that pandemic-related mortality was unrelated to socioeconomic conditions or geography
(Huntington 1923; Crosby 1989; Brainerd and Siegler 2003).
The possible relationship between air pollution and pandemic mortality has been largely
overlooked, despite evidence from human and animal studies that air pollution can increase
susceptibility to viral infection and heighten the risk of severe complications, post-infection
(Jakab 1993; Jaspers et al 2005). This link could have been especially pronounced during 1918

1

outbreak, given the devastating impact of the H1N1 virus on lung function (Ireland 1928) and the
high levels of air pollution in American cities (Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2).
This paper studies the impact of air pollution on mortality associated with the 1918
pandemic. The analysis draws on a panel of infant and all-age mortality for the period 1915 to
1925 in 180 American cities, representing 60 percent of the urban and 30 percent of the total
population. Mortality is linked to a novel measure of city air pollution: coal-fired capacity for
electricity generation. Information on electricity plants with at least 5 megawatts of capacity is
available in 1915 including location, capacity and type of generation (coal or hydroelectric).
Coal-fired electricity generation was a major source of urban air pollution in the early
20th century. Given historical limitations in electricity transmission, coal-fired plants were
typically located near urban areas, producing large volumes of unregulated emissions. A detailed
study of Chicago found that in 1912 nearly one half of visible smoke was due to coal-fired
electricity generation (Goss 1915). Unlike air pollution from residential coal use, which occurred
primarily during the winter months (Barreca, Clay, and Tarr 2016), coal-fired plants produced
emissions throughout the fall outbreak of 1918. Coal-fired capacity varied widely across cities,
in part, because of differences in the availability of fuel. The empirical analysis is based on a
difference-in-differences approach that compares changes in mortality in 1918 in high and
medium coal-fired capacity cities to mortality changes in cities with low coal-fired capacity with
similar baseline socioeconomic conditions and pre-pandemic mortality rates.
We find that air pollution exacerbated the impact of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic. Cities
that used more coal for electricity generation experienced large relative increases in 1918 infant
and all-age mortality: infant mortality increased by 11 percent in high coal-capacity cities and 8
percent in medium coal cities relative to low coal-capacity cities; meanwhile, the relative

2

increases for all-age mortality were 10 and 5 percent in high and medium coal-capacity cities.
The estimates imply that pollution in high and medium coal cities was responsible for 30,000 to
42,000 additional deaths during the pandemic, or 19 to 26 percent of total pandemic mortality.
We evaluate alternative determinants of pandemic severity. Guided by the historical
literature, we focus on factors related to city poverty, the timing of pandemic onset, and local
public interventions. Pandemic mortality was somewhat more elevated in cities with high
concentrations of immigrants and poor water quality, consistent with previous research on the
relationship between poverty, baseline health, and pandemic severity. The timing of onset was
also related to pandemic mortality. Cities hit by earlier outbreaks had particularly high mortality
rates, consistent with the virus having weakened over time. We also find suggestive evidence
that local interventions mitigated pandemic severity. The relationship between pollution and
pandemic mortality is unaffected by the inclusion of controls for these alternative factors.
The 1918 Influenza Pandemic continues to be widely studied because of its relevance to
preventing future outbreaks. A large medical literature has sought to understand the particular
characteristics of the H1N1 strain responsible for the pandemic (see Taubenberger and Morens
2006, for a discussion). Beginning with Almond (2006), economists have also used the pandemic
to examine the long-term outcomes of survivors, although there has been some debate about the
size of the effects (see Brown and Thomas 2013; Beach et al. 2017). This paper contributes to
this literature by providing evidence on another determinant of pandemic severity, air pollution.
Drawing on a new panel dataset on mortality that covers a large sample of American cities, we
are also able to evaluate the importance of a number of determinants of pandemic severity that
have been previously identified by the historical literature. Given that the risks posed by a severe

3

influenza pandemic are substantial and unlikely to be met by the existing medical infrastructure,
the findings may be relevant to the public health response to future outbreaks.
This paper also contributes to the literature on air pollution and mortality by providing
evidence on the interaction between air pollution and infectious disease. A number of studies
have shown a causal link between air pollution and mortality (e.g., Chay and Greenstone 2003a
2003b; Currie and Neidell 2005). These studies typically rely on short-term variation in air
pollution to identify the health impact. There has been less research on the interaction. A number
of epidemiological studies indicate associations between exposure to air pollutants and increased
risk for respiratory virus infections (Ciencewicki and Jaspers 2007), although it is unclear
whether those correlations have a causal interpretation. Our results demonstrate how exposure to
air pollution can exacerbate the mortality effects of severe, if less frequent, health shocks.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic
The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 was brief, but severe. Estimates of worldwide
fatalities range from 50-100 million (Crosby 1989; Johnson and Mueller 2002). In the United
States, fatalities were between 675,000 and 850,000. In some victims, the virus triggered a
‘cytokine storm’, an overreaction of the body’s immune system that typically led to a rapid
deterioration in health. The majority of deaths, however, were caused by a secondary infection,
such as bacterial pneumonia, which typically developed in the days and weeks after initial
infection (Barry 2004). Figure 1 reports national influenza and pneumonia death rates by month
for the 1918-1919 period and the average over the previous five years. Pandemic-related
mortality was particularly elevated from October 1918 and January 1919. This four-month
period accounted for over 90 percent of pandemic-related deaths.

4

The pandemic was caused by the H1N1 virus. Unlike the seasonal flu, which is typically
caused by slight variations in pre-existing strains, the vast majority of individuals lacked
immunity to the virus. 1 Approximately 30 percent of the U.S. population contracted the H1N1
virus in 1918-1919, and fatality rates among those who contracted the virus exceeded 2.5
percent, which is far higher than typical mortality of 0.1 percent (Collins 1931). The Spanish Flu
was also characterized by an unusual ‘W’ age distribution of mortality (see Appendix Figure
A.1). The high mortality rates among young adults have been linked to an overreaction of the
immune system (Barry 2004). Infant mortality was caused by both postnatal exposure to the
virus and higher rates of premature birth (Reid 2005).
The pandemic first appeared in the U.S. as part of a mild influenza outbreak during the
spring of 1918. Historians have sought to identify the site of origin of the 1918 Influenza
Pandemic. Some accounts suggest that the first human infection occurred in Haskell County,
Kansas in late January and early February 1918, and then spread to Europe by American troops
(Barry 2004). It is believed that a mutation in the strain during the summer led to a sharp
increase in virulence.
The most serious wave of the pandemic originated in Camp Devens near Boston in the
first week of September 1918, and then spread rapidly throughout the country. By midSeptember, the pandemic had surfaced in most East Coast cities and then moved westward,
diffusing nationwide by early October (Sydenstricker 1918).
Determinants of Pandemic Mortality

1

There is some debate among medical historians over whether a previous strain of the virus was

also responsible for the 1889-1890 pandemic (Barry 2004).

5

There were wide cross-city differences in pandemic severity. Pandemic mortality was
more than 2.5 times higher in cities at the 90th percentile relative to cities at the 10th percentile. 2
Differences in pandemic mortality were large even among cities within the same state. For
example, mortality rates in Gary, Indiana, were more than twice as high as those in Indianapolis.
Although researchers have commented on the differences, there is little consensus on the
underlying causes (Huntington 1923; Crosby 1989; Kolata 1999; Brainerd and Siegler 2003).
The medical and public health response to the pandemic appears to have been largely
ineffective. Antibiotics had not yet been developed, and so could not be used to treat the bacterial
pneumonia that often developed, and medicine, more generally, had little to offer beyond
palliative care. Municipalities were often slow to adopt preventative measures, which included
bans of public gatherings, regulations against spitting in public, and campaigns to the wearing of
masks. Most researchers consider these public interventions to have had little effect on pandemic
mortality (Brainerd and Siegler 2003; Crosby 1989). 3
Historians have argued that the timing of local onset, driven in part by the movement of
military personnel, influenced pandemic mortality (Barry 2004; Byerly 2010; Sydenstricker
1918; Crosby 1989). Some accounts suggest that the virus weakened substantially in midOctober of 1918, and that cities that experienced later outbreak were exposed to a less virulent
strain. Poverty has also been linked to pandemic mortality, both because of higher transmission
in poor neighborhoods and lower levels of baseline health capital, although notably no

2

These calculations are based on the sample of 180 cities used in the analysis.

In contrast, Bootsma and Ferguson (2007) and Markel et al. (2007), find evidence that public

health interventions reduced pandemic mortality.

relationship has been found between crowding, measured by population density, and pandemic
mortality (Grantz et al. 2016; Tuckel et al. 2006)
Pandemic Severity, Air Pollution, and Coal-fired Electricity Generation
Air pollution has received almost no attention from the historical literature on the
pandemic, despite emerging evidence that air pollution exacerbates pandemics. In randomized
control trials, mice exposed to higher levels of particulate matter (PM) experienced increased
mortality when infected with a common strain of the influenza virus (Hahon et al. 1985; Harrod
et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2014). Microbiology studies of respiratory cells also identify a link
between pollution exposure and respiratory infection. Respiratory cells are the primary site for
influenza virus infection and replication, and PM exposure increases the viral-load post-infection
(Jaspers et al. 2005). Air pollution has also been shown to increase the severity of bacterial
infections in the lungs (Jakab 1993).
The effects of air pollution may have been particularly acute during the 1918 pandemic
given the pathology of the H1N1 virus. Pandemic mortality was often caused by a secondary
infection, such as bacterial pneumonia. Contemporary researchers noted the impact of the
pandemic virus on lungs. As reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
doctors noted that “lung lesions, complex and variable, struck one as being quite different in
character to anything one had met with at all commonly in thousands of autopsies one had
performed during the last 20 years” (Ireland 1928, p.150).
Although systematic cross-city information on air quality was not available until the mid1950s, intermittent monitor readings during the early 20th century suggest that air pollution was
severe and varied widely across cities. Average levels of total suspended particulates (TSP) air
pollution across 15 large American cities were seven times higher than the annual threshold and

7

twice the maximum daily threshold initially set under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970
(Appendix Table A.2). In 1912, the Bureau of Mines reported that 23 of 28 cities with
populations over 200,000 were trying to combat smoke (Appendix Table A.1). Dozens of smaller
cities also passed ordinances.
Electricity generation was a significant contributor to urban air pollution. In 1912,
electricity generating plants accounted for 44 percent of visible smoke in Chicago, while
residential coal consumption contributed just 4 percent (Goss 1915). 4 Moreover, coal-fired
power plants operated continuously throughout the fall of 1918, whereas residential coal
consumption was concentrated in the winter months (Barreca, Clay and Tarr 2016).
There were large differences in the sources of electricity generation based on local
availability of inputs. For example, both Grand Rapids and Lansing had similar installed
electricity capacity in 1915, although Grand Rapids, which had more abundant sources hydro
potential, generated more than twice as much power from hydroelectricity. At the state level,
there is a positive relationship between total coal consumption and coal-fired generating
capacity, and a negative relationship between total coal consumption and hydro capacity
(Appendix Figure A.2), reflecting the fact that coal-fired power was concentrated in the
Midwestern states with abundant coal resources.
DATA CONSTRUCTION AND CITY CHARACTERISTICS BY COAL-FIRED CAPACITY

These estimates were based on Ringelmann Chart measurements, a method used to quantify

emission according to the density of observed smoke. Ringelmann measurements were widely
used throughout the first half of the 20th century to establish whether emissions exceeded the
standards permissible under local ordinances (U.S. Department of the Interior 1967).

8

To study the impact of air pollution on pandemic severity, we combine information on
city coal-fired capacity with a panel dataset on mortality. Infant and all-age deaths were collected
from the Mortality Statistics for a panel of 180 registration cities for the period 1915-1925. 5 We
begin with an initial sample of 283 cities with a population of at least 20,000 in 1921. From this
sample, we drop 88 cities with missing information on covariates, and exclude an additional 15
cities located in states that did not use coal for electricity generation, leaving a final sample of
180 cities. Cities are linked to pre-pandemic county-level demographic and economic
characteristics drawn from the census of population and census of manufacturing (Haines and
ICPSR 2010).
We combine the data on infant and all-age deaths with information on city population and
births in 1921 to calculate the infant mortality rates per 1,000 live births in 1921, and the all-age
mortality rates per 10,000 city residents in 1921. Infant mortality is widely used in studies of air
pollution, since infants are especially vulnerable to environmental exposure and current air
pollution concentrations are a better reflection of lifetime exposure (Currie et al. 2014).
Contemporary evidence suggests that both infant and all-age deaths were accurately recorded,
although there was substantial underregistration of births, particularly among minority
populations (Grove 1943). Because underreporting of births may bias estimates in panel
regression analyses (Eriksson, Niemesh, and Thomasson 2017), we explore the sensitivity of the
main results to several alternative measures of the infant mortality rate.
To construct a proxy for city-level pollution, we digitized information from a 1915
federal report on the location and capacity of coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations with

installed capacity of at least 5 megawatts (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1916). These data
account for 67 percent of installed coal-fired capacity and 83 percent of installed hydroelectric
capacity in 1915. 6 We calculate total coal-fired capacity within a 30-mile radius of each citycentroid, and classify cities into terciles (low, medium, high) of coal-fired capacity. This radius
was chosen to capture the fact that the majority of power plant emissions are dispersed locally
(Seinfeld and Pandis 2012). 7 To assess whether local coal-fired capacity was related to urban air
pollution, we estimate city-level regressions that compare the relationship between coal-fired
capacity in 1915 and TSP concentrations in the mid-20th century, controlling for city population,
the urban share, and total manufacturing employment. 8 Despite a lag of almost 50 years, there is
a clear positive relationship between coal-fired capacity and measured air pollution, and a
negative relationship between hydro capacity and TSP concentrations (Appendix Figure A.3).
Coal-fired generating capacity varied widely across cities. Cities with more coal capacity
tended to have larger manufacturing sectors, perhaps reflecting higher electricity demand. They

6

These calculations are derived from interpolated values of total installed generating capacity for

electric utilities and industrial generating plants in 1912 and 1917 (Historical Statistics of the
United States 1976, p.821).
7

Recent evidence from Illinois found that over 40 percent of exposure occurred within 30 miles

of a power plant (Levy et al. 2002). Historically, air pollution would have been substantially
more localized, given the increase in power plant smoke stack heights that has occurred over the
past 50 years (Hales 1976, p.10).
8

Given the paucity of data on early 20th century city air quality, it is impossible to evaluate the

contemporaneous link between local coal-fired capacity and air pollution.

10

also tended to use more coal for residential purposes, reflecting greater local availability
(Appendix Table A.3). Despite these differences, almost half of the cross-city variation in coal
capacity cannot be explained by standard socioeconomic measures. This idiosyncratic variation
in coal capacity across cities will form the basis of our empirical strategy.
Table 1 (col. 1) reports mean characteristics for the sample of 180 cities. The infant
mortality rate was 86 per 1,000 live births, and decreased over the sample period (Figure 2a).
The all-age mortality rate was 138 per 10,000 residents, and remained roughly stable in nonpandemic years (Figure 2b). During the pandemic year, infant mortality exceeded its trend by 19
percent and all-age mortality exceeded its trend by 35 percent.
Table 1 reports estimated differences in city characteristics for medium coal capacity and
high coal capacity relative to low coal capacity cities. We report unadjusted differences in
outcomes (cols. 2 and 3) and propensity score adjusted differences (cols. 4 and 5). 9 Over the full
period, there is no statistically significant difference in unadjusted or adjusted infant mortality
rates by coal capacity. There is a slightly negative relationship between all-age mortality and
coal capacity, indicating that healthier workers were somewhat more likely to reside in highly

9

To construct propensity score adjusted differences we calculate a city-specific propensity score

for tercile of coal use based on pre-pandemic socioeconomic conditions (log city population,
fraction white, fraction foreign born, fraction urban, log manufacturing employment, log
manufacturing payroll per worker, and tercile of residential coal consumption). Propensity scores
are estimated using an ordered probit regression to allow for the three bin tercile specification.
Adjusted differences in outcomes are then calculated using a linear regression model that
controls for the propensity score.

11

polluted cities, potentially drawn to better labor market opportunities. These differences are
eliminated after adjusting for baseline socioeconomic conditions in col. 4 and 5. 10 High and low
coal cities are estimated to have had similar trends in mortality both prior to the pandemic and
over the entire sample period. Despite these similarities in non-pandemic years, high coal cities
experienced a differential rise in mortality in 1918. Cities in the top tercile had excess infant
mortality rates that were 10.8 percentage points higher than cities in the bottom tercile, and the
gap in excess all-age mortality rates was 6.3 percentage points. We also estimate large
differences in coal-fired capacity across the three terciles that are not explained by baseline
socioeconomic conditions (Panel B).
There were other differences in socioeconomic characteristics across the three terciles of
coal-fired capacity. High coal cities were more populous, had larger manufacturing sectors, had a
higher concentration of foreign-born residents, and burned more coal for residential use (Panels
C and D). Adjusting for the propensity score largely eliminates these differences. To the extent
that high and low coal cities were different in either pre-trends or levels, our empirical controls
for both city and year fixed effects, and allows for differential non-pandemic trends in mortality
and differential changes in mortality in 1918 according to each observable pre-pandemic
characteristic and baseline dependent variables.

10

These baseline differences suggest that the results are unlikely to be driven by the sorting of

less healthy individuals into heavily polluted cities. Nevertheless, to the extent that less healthy
individuals sorted into high pollution cities in ways that are not reflected by either pre-pandemic
mortality rates or other socioeconomic variables, the estimates might overstate the influence of
air pollution on pandemic severity.

12

EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK
To study the effects of air pollution on pandemic mortality, we adopt a difference-indifferences approach that combines the sharp timing of the pandemic with large cross-city
differences in coal-fired capacity. The empirical analysis is based on a comparison of average
changes in mortality during the pandemic across cities with higher levels of coal-fired capacity
relative to changes in mortality in cities with lower levels of coal-fired capacity that had similar
pre-pandemic observable characteristics and similar pre-pandemic mortality rates. 11 Formally,
outcome 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 in city c and year t is regressed on city and year fixed effects (𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 and 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 ), indicators
for high coal capacity (𝐻𝐻𝑐𝑐 ) and medium coal capacity (𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ) that are each interacted with year

fixed effects, separate controls for pre-pandemic mortality in 1915 and 1916 (𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ) that are each
interacted with year fixed effects, pre-pandemic county characteristics (𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 ) that are each
interacted with a linear time trend and an indicator for 1918, and an error term (𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ):

𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 𝐻𝐻𝑐𝑐 ∙ 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2𝑡𝑡 𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐 ∙ 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐,𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ∙ 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 ∙ 𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃18 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 ∙ 𝐼𝐼(18) + 𝜇𝜇𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 .

(1)

The coefficients for coal capacity (𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 and 𝛽𝛽2𝑡𝑡 ) are allowed to vary in each year. We set 1917 as
the reference year. As a result, each coefficient 𝛽𝛽1𝑡𝑡 (𝛽𝛽2𝑡𝑡 ) captures the differential change in

mortality from 1917 to year t in high (medium) coal cities relative to the change in mortality in
low coal cities over the same period.
Equation (1) includes controls for baseline mortality in 1915 and 1916 (separately)
interacted with year fixed effects. These controls allow for differences in pandemic severity
according to baseline population health. The vector 𝑋𝑋𝑐𝑐 includes the baseline demographic and
11

The empirical strategy is similar to the approach used by Hornbeck (2012).

13

economic control reported in Table 1, panel C, along with city longitude and latitude. Each
variable is interacted with a linear time trend and a dummy variable for 1918. 12 These controls
allow for both differential trends in mortality and differential changes in mortality during the
pandemic year according to city socioeconomic conditions and geography.
The identification assumption is that the increase in mortality in 1918 would have been
similar across the three groups of cities in the absence of coal capacity differences. In practice,
this assumption must hold after allowing for differential changes in mortality related to baseline
city characteristics and pre-pandemic mortality rates. In the next section we demonstrate the
validity of the empirical methodology and assess threats to identification.
Two other estimation details are worth noting. First, the regressions are unweighted.
Standard errors are clustered at the city level to adjust for heteroskedasticity and within-city
correlation over time.
RESULTS
Infant and All-Age Mortality

12

Demographic controls include city population in 1921, and county-level variables for fraction

urban, fraction foreign born, fraction nonwhite (all measured in 1910). Economic controls
include manufacturing employment in 1910, manufacturing payroll per worker in 1900 (data is
unavailable for 1910), and the tercile of residential coal use per capita in 1918 (Lesher 1918).
Among other things, these manufacturing covariates control for alternative sources of city air
pollution.

14

To illustrate the empirical approach, Figure 3 graphs estimated βs with different sets of
controls (see equation (1)). 13 This ‘event-study’ design compares changes in mortality in each
year from 1915 to 1925 relative to the 1917 baseline year. The figure allows us to assess the
identification assumption that absent the pandemic, mortality in high and low coal cities would
have trended similarly in 1918. The left-hand figures report the coefficient estimates from
regression models that include city fixed effects, year fixed effects, and geographic controls that
capture the spread of the virus. 14 The right-hand figures report the coefficient estimates from the
fully specified regression model reported in equation (1), with additional controls for 1915 and
1916 mortality interacted with year along with the full set of demographic and economic
covariates. Panel A reports the results for infant mortality, and panel B for all-age mortality.
In 1918, infant mortality and all age mortality in high-capacity and medium-capacity
cities increased relative to low-capacity cities. The rise in 1918 mortality was particularly large
in high-capacity cities. The relative increases in mortality were temporary, and in the years
following the pandemic, mortality changes were similar across the three groups of cities. In
contrast, there is no statistically significant relationship between coal capacity and changes in
mortality in non-pandemic years, supporting our identifying assumption that mortality would
have trended similarly in 1918 in the absence of the pandemic.

13

The coefficient estimates with the confidence intervals are reported in Appendix Figures A.5

and A.6.
14

The geographic controls are city longitude and latitude, each interacted with a linear trend and

a dummy variable for 1918.

15

Table 2, columns 1-3, reports results for infant mortality from estimating equation (1). In
column 1, we include city and year fixed effects along with controls for baseline mortality and
geography. In column 2, we add controls for baseline city demographic characteristics, and, in
column 3, we include the full set of economic controls as described in equation (1). There is a
strong relationship between coal capacity and pandemic-related infant mortality that is stable
across the different specifications. In 1918, infant mortality increased by 11.0 percent more in
high-capacity cities and 7.8 percent more in medium-capacity cities than in low-capacity cities
(col. 3).
There were similarly large relative increases in pandemic all-age mortality in high coal
cities. Table 2, cols. 4-6, reports the coefficient estimates for the 1918 interaction effect for high
and medium coal cities. In 1918, all-age mortality increased by an additional 9.6 percent in highcapacity cities and 5.4 percent in medium-capacity cities as compared to changes in low-capacity
cities (col. 6).
The differential increases in mortality in high- and medium-capacity cities during the
pandemic year are consistent with the epidemiological and experimental evidence on the role of
air pollution in increasing influenza morbidity and mortality. The observed relationships could
reflect the effects of air pollution exposure in the months prior to the pandemic, exposure during
the pandemic, or some combination of the two.
Because the regression models control flexibly for trends based on pre-pandemic
mortality rates, the coefficient estimates capture the impact of coal capacity on pandemic
mortality across cities with similar baseline health. In the fully specified model, we also include
baseline demographic and economic covariates, each interacted with a time trend and a 1918
dummy to allow for differences in pandemic mortality according to each pre-pandemic factor.

16

The fact that these covariates have very little impact on the main coefficient estimates strongly
suggests that there was an independent relationship between coal capacity and pandemic
mortality that was not driven by differences in population characteristics or industrial
composition.
To quantify the impact of air pollution on pandemic severity we calculate the number of
deaths attributable to coal, based on the coefficient estimates from Table 2 and compare these to
the total number of excess deaths in 1918 in the sample population. Table 3 reports the results.
The top panel reports the estimates of the total number of excess deaths in 1918 for cities in each
of the three terciles of coal capacity (see Appendix B). In total, we calculate that there were
158,000 excess deaths in 1918 in the sample. 15 Given that our sample comprises roughly 30
percent of the U.S. population, these calculations fall within the range of previous estimates of
total U.S. pandemic mortality (Crosby 1989).
We evaluate the number of pandemic-related deaths in a counterfactual scenario in which
coal capacity in high and medium is reduced to the low capacity level. The calculations are
derived based on the coefficient estimates in column 6 of Table 2. We rely on two different
approaches to calculate the number of deaths averted. In the first approach, we multiply the total
exposed population by the change in mortality probability implied by the regression coefficients.
In the second approach, we compare the observed excess 1918 mortality rate to the
counterfactual excess mortality rate implied by the regression estimates (see Appendix B for
calculations). Both approaches yield large counterfactual reductions in mortality. We calculate
that 30,000 to 42,000 total deaths (5,600 to 6,500 infant deaths) would have been averted, a 19 to

15

Infants accounted for less than 10 percent of total pandemic-related mortality.

17

26 percent reduction in pandemic mortality. The majority of the deaths averted would have
occurred in high-capacity cities. These cities tended to be more populous, so the health impacts
of coal were particularly severe.
The economic costs of air pollution during the pandemic were substantial. Applying a
$1.1 million (2015 dollars) value of a statistical life in 1920 (Costa and Kahn 2004), we calculate
that excess mortality in high and medium coal cities led to a loss of $45.9 billion, equivalent to
almost 6 percent of total U.S. GDP in 1918. These losses do not account for the morbidity effects
and the losses in worker output in 1918.
Poverty, Timing of Onset, Local Interventions, and Pandemic Mortality
Having established a link between coal capacity and pandemic mortality, we now explore
other potential determinants of pandemic severity. Table 4 explores the importance of factors
related to city poverty and the geographic spread of the pandemic throughout the country.
We assess the impact of various proxies for city poverty on pandemic-related mortality.
We include measures of the percent white, percent foreign born, and the typhoid rate in 19001905, an indicator for poor quality of drinking water (Beach et al. 2016), all interacted with an
indicator for 1918. 16 To separately identify the role of these poverty proxies, these regression
models do not include baseline mortality controls. The coefficient estimates reflect the extent to
which differences in various measures of socioeconomic conditions were related to pandemic
severity.
We find some evidence that city poverty and baseline health conditions were related to
pandemic mortality (Table 4, cols. 1 and 2). Higher concentrations of foreign born are associated

16

Data on city typhoid mortality rates were compiled from Whipple (1908).

18

with excess all-age mortality, and the fraction white is negatively related to pandemic mortality
although the coefficient estimates are not statistically significant. Poor water quality, as proxied
by typhoid mortality, is also positively related to all-age pandemic mortality.
Historians have argued that the timing of pandemic onset was related to its severity
(Crosby 1989; Sydenstricker 1918). Researchers have claimed that the virus weakened over the
course of the fall of 1918, so that locations that experienced a delayed onset were exposed to a
less virulent strain. The ability of public officials to respond to the outbreak may also have been
related to the timing of local onset.
We assess whether factors related to the timing of onset were related to pandemic
mortality. For this analysis, we omit controls for longitude and latitude to separately identify the
role of geography. First, we use information on the week of pandemic onset from Sydenstricker
(1918). The pandemic first surfaced along the East Coast in early September, and moved
westward, diffusing nationwide by mid-October. We construct a dummy variable for ‘late’
arrival cities that experienced onset after September 27, and interact this variable with an
indicator for 1918 to allow for differences in severity based on the time of onset. 17 The results

17

This specification is chosen to reflect the views of historians that the evolution of weekly

pandemic virulence was nonlinear. In particular, estimates of weekly virulence from Baltimore, a
city thought to be representative of the nation as a whole, indicate that the virus gained strength
through September and then weakened significantly in mid-October (Sydenstricker 1918). In
practice, we find qualitatively similar results in regression that use the continuous measure of
week of onset.

19

(reported in col. 3) show that both infant and all-age mortality were significantly lower in late
arrival cities, consistent with previous claims about the evolution of the virus.
Next, we assess the role of World War I in influencing local pandemic severity. The
movement of military personnel is believed to have been an important determinant of pandemic
timing. Crosby (1989), Kolata (2001), Barry (2004), and Byerly (2010) provide detailed accounts
of the pandemic in the military and the role of the Navy and Army in its spread. We digitized
information on the location of major army training camps in 1918 (U.S. War Department 1919,
p.1519), and construct a dummy variable for whether a city was below- or above-median
distance from a base. We interact this variable with a 1918 indicator to allow for differences in
pandemic severity according to exposure to WWI military bases. The results (col. 4) show that
infant mortality was significantly higher in cities near a base. The coefficient estimates for allage mortality are also positive, albeit smaller in magnitude and statistically insignificant.
Overall, the results in Table 4 support the historical narrative that both urban poverty and
factors related to the timing of pandemic onset were related to local severity. Importantly, across
all these alternative specifications and different samples, the impact of coal capacity remains
stable, suggesting that the main results were not driven by one of these alternative mechanisms.
Some researchers have argued that other local public interventions, such as quarantines
and bans on public gatherings, influenced severity (Markel et al. 2007). To assess the role of the
local public health effort, we use data from Markel et al. (2007) on local interventions for a subsample of 32 cities and construct indicators for early and long-term interventions following their

20

classification. We interact these indicators with the 1918 dummy, and re-estimate a simplified
version of equation (1) for the sub-sample of cities. 18
The results are reported in Table 5. For comparison, we report the estimates from this
modified specification in column 1. Restricting the sample to the 32 quarantine cities, the
coefficient estimates for medium capacity are not statistically significant, although the
coefficients for high coal-fired capacity remain statistically significant and similar in magnitude
to the estimates in Table 2. The coefficient estimates for early and long-term intervention are
negative although not statistically significant. Broadly, these findings support the conclusions of
Markel et al. (2007) and Bootsma et al. (2007) that local public health initiatives may have
played a role in mitigating the effects of the pandemic.
Robustness Checks
One potential concern with the previous results is misreporting of the mortality rate.
Although infant and all-age deaths are generally thought to have been accurately recorded,
underregistration of births could bias the estimates for infant mortality (Eriksson, Niemesh and
Thomasson 2017). Moreover, because our measure of the infant mortality rate is constructed
based on births in 1921 rather than contemporaneous births, annual fluctuations in fertility could
bias the main estimates. We explore the sensitivity of the results to two alternate measures of the
infant mortality rate: infant deaths per 1,000 annual births, and infant deaths per 10,000 city
residents in 1921. Estimates based on the first measure will not be biased by annual fluctuations

18

Given the limited sample size, we use a restricted set of covariates for city and year fixed

effects, and longitude/latitude and city population (each interacted with a linear time trend and an
indicator for 1918).

21

in fertility, although because a number of cities began collecting information on births midway
through the sample period, we must omit roughly one quarter of the sample. Meanwhile, the
second measure will not be affected by reporting error due to the underregistration of births.
Table 6 reports the results based on the alternate measures of infant mortality, which are
both highly correlated with the original dependent variable. For reference, column 1 reports the
baseline results. Column 2 reports the results based on infant deaths per 1,000 annual births.
Despite the limited sample size, the estimated effects are similar in magnitude to the original
findings. Column 3 reports the results based on infant death per city population in 1921. The
coefficient estimates are also very similar to the baseline estimates, providing confidence that the
main findings were not influenced by mismeasurement of births.
Table 7 provides a number of robustness checks. For reference, column 1 reports the
baseline specification. Columns (2) to (4) explore sensitivity to alternate control variables. In
column 2, we add controls for linear state-specific trends to allow for differential trends in
mortality across states. The results are not affected by these covariates. In column 3, we replace
the control for log population with log population density. This covariate allows for differences
in pandemic transmission, for example, due to crowding. Because we lack information on
contemporaneous population density, this variable is constructed by dividing city population in
1921 by city area reported in the 1944 City Books (Haines and ICPSR 2010). 19 The coefficient
estimates are very similar to the main findings, consistent with epidemiological evidence

19

The 1920 Census of Population only reported information on population density for cities with

at least 100,000 residents. Among cities for which we observe both measures of population
density, the correlation between the two variables is 0.89.

22

showing no association between population density and pandemic mortality (Grantz et al. 2016).
In column (4), we explore the sensitivity of the main findings to controls for the population age
structure. We add controls for fraction of the population age 18 to 44, who were particularly
susceptible to the virus. The main findings are unaffected by this covariate.
Columns (5) to (8) examine the sensitivity of the results to alternate specifications and
samples. In column 5, we re-estimate the model based on the mortality rate in levels rather than
logs. The estimated effects are statistically significant and economically important. For infant
mortality, the coefficient estimates imply increases in pandemic mortality of 15 (=13.0/85.5)
percent and 9 (=7.6/85.5) percent in high coal and medium coal cities relative to low coal cities.
For all-age mortality, the implied relative increases are 8 (=11.0/138.2) percent and 15
(=21.1/138.2) percent in high and medium coal cities. In column 6, we report the results,
dropping cities for which more than one year of mortality data is missing. In column 7, we drop
cities in the South. The coefficients on coal-fired capacity remain similar to the baseline values
in sign, significance, and magnitude. In column 8, we re-estimate the regressions for cities with
at least 50,000 residents in 1921 to examine the sensitivity of the results to outlier mortality rates
in smaller cities. The results are not sensitive to this sample restriction. 20
To conclude the empirical analysis, we provide two additional tests of the research
design. First, we explore heterogeneity in the coal-pandemic relationship according to average
city wind speed. Intuitively, the local impact of coal consumption should be mitigated by higher
wind speeds, which disperse pollutants over a wider region (e.g., Wang and Ogawa 2015). We

20

Coefficient estimates based on winsorized mortality rates are also similar in magnitude and

significance.

23

assemble information on average annual speed at an elevation of 80 meters from the U.S.
Department of Energy (2017), to identify cities above-median and below-median wind, and
allow the effects of coal capacity to vary according to this variable. 21 The results show
consistently larger mortality effects in low wind cities (col. 9), consistent with higher winds
having mitigating the local health impacts of air pollution during the pandemic.
Second, we estimate a set of placebo regressions based on hydroelectric capacity, which
generated electricity but was emissions free. In these regressions we interact indicators for
medium and high hydroelectric capacity with 1918. The results show no significant relationship
between hydro capacity and excess infant or all-age mortality in 1918 (col. 10). 22
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The 1918 Influenza Pandemic was an exceptional historical episode, with death rates 5 to
20 times higher than typical pandemics. A century later, the ‘Spanish Flu’ continues to be an
active area of historical analysis, with researchers seeking to understand its origin, the sources of
its virulence, and its epidemiological features. Despite ongoing research, basic questions remain
about the spread of the virus, and the sources of the stark regional patterns in mortality.

21

We focus on wind speed at an 80m elevation rather than at ground level to capture the

dispersion of pollutants from power plant smoke stacks that typically exceeded 50m in the early
20th century (Hales 1976).
22

In addition to these robustness tests, we have also explored the sensitivity of the main findings

to a number of additional controls. The main findings cannot be attributed to differences in the
size of the population eligible for military service, differences in city weather conditions during
the pandemic, or access to the railway system.

24

This paper provides new evidence on role of air pollution in exacerbating the pandemic.
The effects of air pollution on pandemic mortality were sizeable. Cities with high levels of coal
capacity collectively experienced tens of thousands of excess deaths in 1918. Our analysis
suggests that pre-pandemic socioeconomic and health conditions also contributed to pandemic
severity as did the timing of its spread throughout the country.
Despite improvements in preventative practices and the development of modern antiviral
drugs and vaccines, a moderately severe modern pandemic could lead to 2 million excess deaths
worldwide (Fan, Jamison, and Summers 2016), and a pandemic virus with similar pathogenicity
to the 1918 virus would likely kill more than 100 million (Taubenberger and Morens 2006). A
better understanding of the factors that influenced mortality during 1918 Influenza Pandemic
may offer critical insights for the mitigation of contemporary pandemics.
Although air quality has improved dramatically over the past 100 years in the United
States, urban air pollution remains a major problem in many developing countries. In fact,
pollution in cities in India and China is comparable to levels in the U.S. in the early 20th century
(Appendix Table A.2). This study’s findings thus have particular relevance to the developing
world, where air pollution is often severe and where there is limited medical infrastructure.
Further research on more recent outbreaks may help shed light on the potential for improved
medical treatments and targeted pollution abatement strategies to mitigate the risks posed by a
global pandemic.

B. Calculating Pandemic-Related Deaths Averted by Reducing Coal-Fired Capacity
This section describes the calculations for the number of pandemic-related deaths averted by
reducing coal-fired capacity that are reported in Table 3. Total excess deaths in 1918 are
calculated as the difference between observed mortality in 1918 and predicted mortality in 1918
based on a city-specific linear trend regression for the period 1915 to 1925. For example, in high
coal cities, all-age mortality exceeded its predicted value in 1918 (138.4 per 10,000 residents) by
40.9 percent. Given a total population of 18.9 million in high coal cities, we estimate that there
were (138.4/10,000)*0.409*18,884,435 = 106,896 excess deaths in 1918 that are attributable to
the pandemic.

50

We rely on two different approaches to calculate the number of deaths averted. For the
first approach, the estimates are calculated by multiplying the total exposed population by the
change in mortality probability implied by the coefficient estimates in Table 2, col. 6. For
example, in high coal cities, we calculate the number of deaths averted as
191.4

To derive the counterfactual deaths for approach 2 we subtract the coefficient estimates

from Table 2, col. 6 from the observed excess mortality in 1918 and then multiplying by the total
population. The counterfactual number of pandemic deaths in high coal cities are given by the
