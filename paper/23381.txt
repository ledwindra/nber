The Dynamics of Gender Earnings Differentials: Evidence from Establishment Data
Erling Barth, Sari Pekkala Kerr, and Claudia Olivetti
NBER Working Paper No. 23381
May 2017, Revised July 2019
JEL No. J16,J31
ABSTRACT
Despite dramatic workforce gains by women in recent decades, a substantial gender earnings gap
persists and widens over the course of men’s and women’s careers. Since there are earnings
differences across establishments, a key question is the extent to which the widening of the
gender pay gap over time arises from differences in career advances within the same
establishment versus differential gains from job-to-job moves across establishments. Using a
unique match between the 2000 Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal
Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, we find that both channels are important and affect
workers differently by education. For the college-educated the increasing gap is for the most part
due to differential earnings growth within establishment. The between-establishment component
explains only 27 percent of the widening of the total gender pay gap for this group. For workers
without college degree, the establishment component is the main driver of the, relatively small,
widening of the gender earnings gap. For both education groups, marriage plays a crucial role in
the establishment component of the increasing earnings gap.

Women have made remarkable progress in the labor market throughout the past century,
resulting in clear convergence in human capital investment, employment prospects and
outcomes relative to men (Blau and Kahn, 2016). However, remaining gender differences in
pay still persist and increase over the working life, especially so for college graduates, even
within narrowly defined occupations and even when controls are added for hours worked per
week and weeks per year (see Goldin, 2014, and Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz, 2010, on MBAs).
At the same time, recent studies have shown that there are large earnings differentials
across firms and establishments, and that sorting of workers into high- and low-paying
establishments contributes to earnings inequality in the US1 and other countries.2 Since men are
more likely to work in high-paying firms and appear to capture a larger part of the establishment
premium than women, these establishment earnings differentials tend to add to the gender pay
gap (Card, Cardoso, and Kline, 2016). In this paper we use a unique match between the 2000
Decennial Census of the United States and the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics
(LEHD) data to analyze how much of the increase in the gender earnings gap over the life cycle
comes from shifts in the sorting of men and women across high- and low-pay establishments
over the early part of their working life and how much is due to differential earnings growth
within establishment.
The novelty of our analysis with respect to other gender studies based on matched
employer-employee data is its focus on the United States and on the age dynamics of the gender
pay gap, rather than its cross-sectional average. In addition, the unique data match to the 2000
Census of the United States allows us to study how the widening of the wage gap varies by
education and marital status, something that typically cannot be done with matched data, at
least in the United States, but can help gain a better understanding of the potential mechanisms.
The drawback of our data, as we will discuss later, is that while the matched data cover several
years of an individual work history (from 1995 to 2008), key demographic variables are only
observed at one point in time (in 2000). In addition, information in the LEHD is only available
for the subset of states that provided UI data at the time of writing this paper. While this does
not appear to impact the generalizability of our results we return to this point later.

Wachter (2019) study the contribution of establishment and firm pay to the increase in the earnings dispersion.

Figure I shows the predicted earnings-age profiles by gender and education based on
our large panel of workers observed over time and across jobs. We group workers in two
education categories: those who are not college graduates and (four-year) college graduates.
Predicted earnings by age are measured relative to a 25-year-old woman without a college
degree, whose earnings level is set to unity. There are striking differences in earnings profiles
by education. The comparison of black and grey lines for each group shows that the gender
earnings gap widens with age for both education groups, but the widening is far greater among
college graduates, mainly due to the disproportionate increase in college educated men’s
earnings.3 While the gender earnings gap (defined as the ratio of male to female earnings) is
relatively small at age 25 and does not differ much across education groups, by age 45 the gap
is considerably larger, especially for the college-educated. Specifically, the gender earnings gap
for the non-college-educated increases by 32 percentage points (from 15 percent to 47.4
percent) from age 25 to age 45, while for the college-educated it increases by 62 percentage
points (from 13 percent to 75 percent). This finding is broadly consistent with earlier
comprehensive studies using synthetic cohorts.4
The widening in the gender earnings gap as men and women age may be due to the
combination of two different processes. The first - the pay gap between male and female
workers at the same firm or establishment – arises mostly from promotions and raises that
workers at a given establishment accrue over time. The second – the pay gap due to workers
sorting into high- versus low-paying employers – is driven by the presence of different wage
levels across firms and gender-based variation in the likelihood that a worker will both change
jobs and receive a higher salary as a result of that job change.
The two processes arise from very different mechanisms. Within-employer career paths
arise from different wage structures within firms, and the overall design of organizations and
their job ladders. Gender differences within firms may ensue because of competition for higher
positions within the hierarchy (Lazear and Rosen, 1990). The prevalence of convex reward
profiles in working time, especially in some high-paying occupations, also contributes to the
widening of the gender pay gap (Goldin, 2014).

Regressions are based on 15 million observations; see the summary table in the Appendix. The standard errors
of the estimates are thus so small that we have chosen not to draw the confidence intervals around the curves.
4 Goldin (2014) documents that for cohorts born around 1960 and 1970 (the bulk of our sample) the gender
earnings gap for college graduates increases by approximately 48 percentage points between age 25-29 and 4044. Less than 40 percent of this increase can be explained by hours and weeks controls. Goldin’s figures are for
full-time (35+ hours), full year (40+ weeks) workers while our figure includes all workers (and this can explain
the larger increase based on our data). Manning and Swaffield (2008) find similar results for the UK.

Between-employer career paths arise from different wage levels across firms5, that may
be a result of frictions in the labor market, monopsonistic behavior,6 and/or different forms of
rent sharing. In this case, gender pay differences across firms may arise if women have lower
ability to extract rent (Card, Cardoso and Kline, 2016), and thus face a flatter earnings profile
across firms than men, or if women have a less elastic job mobility pattern with respect to
wages, so that employers may engage in monopsonistic discrimination (Barth and Dale-Olsen,
2010).7
Women face both between- and within-establishment gaps. Due to family and
caretaking obligations, women may be less able to put in the long hours required to obtain a big
promotion, or to invest in the networking and job search activities that facilitate financially
advantageous job changes. These effects may be compounded if employers believe women are
less likely to remain in the workforce or have higher cost of effort (Gayle and Golan, 2012;
Albanesi and Olivetti, 2009) or if women are less likely to seek promotions and raises within
and across firms in anticipation of needing more time or flexibility (Bronson and Thoursie,
2018) or because of family location decisions in which the career of the primary earner, usually
the husbands, takes precedence (Taylor, 2007).
In this paper we quantify the importance of career movements within and across
establishments using a full decomposition analysis of the establishment and individual fixed
effects. Specifically, we identify directly the within-job difference in earnings profile over time
between men and women. This difference arises from the combined effects of differences in
wage raises and promotions within the same employer.8 While we cannot distinguish between
internal promotions and earnings growth within job category in our data, we are able to
distinguish between differential seniority profiles, which are experienced within the current job,
but lost when changing employer9, and differential development in the within-establishment

Another frictional mechanism emphasized in this literature has to do with employers’ disutility of hiring
women (Black, 1995, Bowlus and Eckstein, 2002, Flabbi, 2010). See Barth, Bratsberg, and Raaum (2012) on the
importance of establishment affiliation for the development of the immigrant-native earnings gap over time.

Booth, Francesconi, and Frank (2005) use the British Household Panel Survey, and find that women are
promoted at about the same rate as men, but receive smaller wage gains with the promotions. Blau and De Varo
(2007) find that among new hires in in a sample of US establishments women have lower probabilities of
promotion than men, but that wage gains associated with promotions do not differ much.

earnings distribution that is not lost when changing job, e.g. as one changes from a top position
in one firm to a top position in another firm.
We find that among workers without a college degree, there is only a small male
advantage in the within-establishment earnings growth over the first 10 to 15 years of working
life. However, by age 45 women catch up with men in terms of within-establishment earnings
growth. On the other hand, for college educated workers there is a substantial difference in
within-establishment earnings growth by gender: men’s earnings growth is 33 log points higher
than women’s from age 25 to 40. Unlike the non-college educated, college women do not catch
up. By the time they reach age 45 the difference is still 30 log points. A fraction of this
difference is due to higher returns to seniority among men, 1 log point per year of seniority.
The remaining part is due to earnings growth within establishment that is carried over in the
transition to new jobs in other establishments.
The most novel results of our analysis concern the development of the establishment
earnings premium over time for a given individual. For employees without a college degree,
the widening of the difference in the establishment component of the earnings premium
between age 25 and 45 adds 5.4 log points to the overall increasing gender gap in pay. This is
the main source of the gender differential in earnings growth for the less educated. Among
college-educated workers, the gender gap across establishments widens by 11 log points from
age 25 to 45. Since college-educated workers experience a considerable widening of the withinestablishment earnings gap, the expansion in the establishment component can explain only 27
percent of the total widening of the gender wage gap for this group.
Notably this relative more equal performance of women in the no-college degree group
mainly reflects lack of growth in less-educated men’s earnings over this period. Climbing the
career ladder more quickly within a firm plays no role for employees in this group. The small,
early career divergence between men and women’s earnings among high school graduates is
fully explained by men moving to better paying firms in the initial years of their careers.
We find that in the “between firms” gap marriage plays a crucial role. Indeed, married
women’s earning power seems to benefit very little from changing jobs. The evolution of the
establishment pay premium for the never-married is very similar to that of married men.
Descriptive statistics based on the publicly available 2000 Census of the United States (PUMS

5

data) suggest that most of the loss in earnings growth for married women, relative to married
men, occurs concurrently with the arrival of children.
While we currently do not have the ability to investigate how the results of our
decomposition vary by sector (or by occupation), in a companion paper (Goldin et al. 2017)10
we show that while gender differentials in sorting by occupation and industry are important,
they can jointly explain only about a third of the widening of the gender earnings gap that occurs
over time for these cohorts. That is, sorting into high and low paying firms matters even within
narrowly defined industries and occupation (as of 2000). We also find that, for the collegeeducated, the magnitude and growth of the gender earnings gap look quite distinct from one
sector to the next. By the peak of a person’s career, the largest gender gaps can be found in the
health, legal, and financial sectors (including insurance and real estate). Conversely, the
widening of the gender earnings gap with age remains more modest in the tech sector.
This paper is part of a rich and currently burgeoning literature. Blau (1977) is the first
to analyze the role of inter-firm wage differentials in explaining the gender wage gap, a finding
further confirmed in a subsequent study by Groshen (1991). Early contributions using matched
employer-employee data include the study by Barth and Mastekaasa (1996) and Bayard,
Hellerstein, Neumark and Troske (2003) who show that a gender earnings differential persists
even after controlling for gender differences in human capital and sex segregation within
occupation, industry and establishment based on early versions of the matched data for Norway
and the United States, respectively.11 More recently, Card, Cardoso and Kline (2016) show that
firm-specific pay premiums explain just over one-fifth of the average gender earnings gap in
Portugal and interpret it in light of differential bargaining power between male and female
workers.12 Sorkin (2017) does use the LEHD data to address gender differences in sorting into
high-wage firms and industries, in the cross-section. Based on a search model he argues that
women tend to select into firms with better non-pay characteristics. Other authors have used
matched employer/employee data to explore the role of gender segregation and pay structure

10

Goldin et al. (2017) use the data as a set of repeated cross sections of individuals rather than a panel. The
longitudinal aspect of the establishment information is only used to compute mean earnings at the establishment
level over the entire period.
11
The paper by Bayard et al. (2003) uses an earlier version of our data that matched the 1990 Sample Edited
Detail File (consisting of all household responses to the 1990 Decennial Census long form) to establishment
records in the 1990 Standard Statistical Establishment List.
12
In particular, they show that bargaining and sorting based on measured productivity account for about 80% of
the overall impact of firm-specific pay premiums on the gender earnings gap.

for explaining the cross-sectional wage gap in Spain (Amuedo-Dorantes and De La Rica, 2006),
Denmark (Datta Gupta and Rothstein, 2005), Germany (Heinze and Wolf, 2009), Finland
(Korkeamäki and Kyyrä, 2006) and a for cross-section of nine European countries (Simon,
2012). All these papers focus on the cross-sectional gender pay gap. The novelty in our paper
is that we focus on the widening gender pay gap by age in the US, unlike earlier studies with a
similar focus.
The most closely related study to ours is Bronson and Thoursie (2018) who analyze
gender differences in lifecycle earnings growth using administrative data from Sweden. They
find that about 70 percent of the growth in gender earnings gap can be associated with withinfirm earnings growth, while sorting, work experience, tenure and field of education play much
smaller roles. Interestingly, despite Sweden’s generous policies towards families with young
children, Bronson and Thoursie find a significant “motherhood penalty” that affects women’s
earnings and promotions. It is notable that the current study takes place in a very different
setting, with the United States having few concessions towards new mothers in terms of paid
leave, subsidized child care, and other support systems.
The distinction between job separations into non-employment versus job-to-job
separations is important for the analysis of gender differences in earnings growth and job
transitions. While, as discussed above, separations into non-employment may have negative
effects on between-establishment earnings growth, separations to other jobs may have the effect
of improving earnings. Earlier studies of separation rates find that gender differences in the
probability of leaving a job tend to disappear once we control for observable characteristics
(Blau and Kahn, 1981) and attachment to the labor force (Light and Ureta, 1990, 1995). Royalty
(1998) shows the existence of gender differentials in the destination state. Women are more
likely to leave a job for non-employment, while men are more likely to move from one job to
the next (see also Manning 2003). There is also an earlier literature emphasizing differences in
turnover rates (based on longitudinal data) as an important source of gender differentials in
earnings growth for young workers. For example, Loprest (1992) shows that women gain less,
in terms of wage growth, from switching jobs. Bowlus (1997) finds significant gender
differences in quit rates “for personal reasons” that account for 20%–30% of the gender wage
differential. More recently, Del Bono and Vuri (2008) identify gender difference in the returns
to job mobility as the main source of gender earnings growth differentials on a sample of private
sector employees in Italy. Hirsch, and Schnabel (2012) show that lower female wage-elasticity

7

and gender differences in the transition probability are both important for explaining the gender
wage gap in German employer/employee matched data.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I describes our data set and
key variables. Section II discusses our estimation strategy. Finally, the main findings of our
analysis are presented in Section III.

I. DATA AND DEFINITION OF KEY VARIABLES
Our analysis relies on a unique combination of the Longitudinal Employer-Household
Dynamics (LEHD) database and the 2000 Decennial Census of Population (one in six long
form). Both datasets are confidential and housed by the U.S. Census Bureau in the Research
Data Centers (RDC). As the current combination of these two restricted access data sets has
barely ever been used in previous empirical literature, this section will provide a detailed
summary of the construction of our data platform.
The LEHD is based on quarterly, worker-level, filings by all private-sector U.S. firms
in the context of the administration of state unemployment insurance (UI) benefit programs.13
The data identify all employees of an establishment and their quarterly compensation on a
month-to-month basis. UI earnings include wages, salary and taxable bonuses and are not topcoded.14 The state UI system covers about 95% of private sector employment. Thus our analysis
is fully representative of private firms within the geographical areas we study (see Hyatt,
McEntarfer, McKinney, Tibbets, and Walton, 2014; Stevens, 2007). The LEHD is
longitudinally linked at both the firm and employee levels, making it possible to analyze how
firm employment and employee earnings evolve over time, within and across all establishments.
The LEHD vintage used in this paper includes 23 states with varying initial dates of coverage,
starting from 1991, and runs through 2008.
To manage the enormous number of person and firm fixed effects required to estimate
our models, we focus on the largest PMSAs in the U.S. in terms of population as of 1991. Of
the 50 largest U.S. PMSAs, 26 were located in 18 of the 23 LEHD covered states available to

13

LEHD also covers most state and local government employees, with the exception of elected officials, members of a
legislative body or judiciary, and some emergency employees, Federal government employment is not covered.

benefits and shortcomings of these data.

us. Specifically, these PMSAs are located in CA, CO, GA, FL, HI, ID, IL, MD, NC, NJ, NM,
OR, RI, SC, TX, UT, VA and WA. We further reduce our analysis sample by using annual data
from 1995 to 2008 and selecting workers who worked more than two quarters per year and
earned at least $2,000 per quarter, on average, during the year. The last restriction removes from
the sample very short and sporadic employment relationships as well as short-term contract
employment arrangements, and directs our study towards the more permanent work
arrangements. All dollar values are inflated to 2008 values using the all-urban-consumers-CPI
published by the BLS. Finally, we focus on individuals in their prime working age. That is, for
each individual, we only use observations when the person is aged 25-45.
The LEHD records limited information about workers in the individual characteristics
file (ICF). This includes age, gender, race, place of birth, and citizenship status. Through the
employment history files (EHF), we can also discern their earnings and job-by-job employment
histories. Moreover, using the unique person identifiers (PIKs), we are able to match people in
the LEHD to the individual-level records contained in the long-form responses of the 2000
Decennial Census of Population.15 The long-form was given to a random sample of 1-in-6
households and is nationally representative. This process allows us to match almost exactly 1in-6 of our LEHD workers with added Census details from the Person File. The LEHD-Census
match thus includes more detailed and comprehensive information about each individual in our
sample (e.g., level of education, occupation, marital status, class of worker, etc.) and their
respective families (e.g., family composition, detailed characteristics of their spouse, and
household income by source). In the current study we mainly extract individual-level
characteristics, that is, educational attainment, marital status and race. It is worth emphasizing
that while the LEHD longitudinally follows the same individuals over time across jobs, the
2000 Census is obviously just a snapshot. To the extent that the person’s marital status,
education or occupation changes, either before or after 2000, we will not be able to capture that.
The LEHD sample linked to the 2000 Census is over 12 million annual observations, covering
about 3.3 million individual persons.
A possible concern with the LEHD data is that it tracks quarterly employment and
earnings, but does not contain information on hours worked or hourly wage.16 Therefore, in

15

The Census Bureau has created the unique person identifiers (PIKs) based on Social Security Numbers (SSNs). These
PIKs allow the linking of individuals across demographic surveys, censuses and administrative records.
16
Some states, most notably Washington, collect data on hours worked for hourly wage employees. We did not have access
to those data or a permission to link them to the LEHD at the time of writing this paper. See Lachowska, Mas, and Woodbury
(2017) for an example of a paper using the WA linked employer – employee data with hours.

9

theory, any age or cohort trend in the gender earnings gap could be driven by a divergence of
hours worked. To explore this issue in detail, we analyze repeated cross-sections of the
American Community Survey (ACS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS). With those
data we can derive different earnings concepts, including annual, quarterly and weekly
earnings, as well as hourly wages.
In Figure II we use CPS data to show age profiles by cohort, education and gender for
college graduates measured as quarterly earnings and hourly earnings. Appendix 2 provides
details of the data and estimation. It does not appear that differences in hours worked over the
life cycle affect the relative shape of the age profiles across genders and cohorts. In the
appendix, we show similar graphs for non-college workers, and again conclude that the age
profiles are very similar irrespective of earnings measures.
In appendix 3 we also show estimated age patterns of the gender earnings gap, measured
either in terms of annual earnings, weekly earnings and hourly wages using the American
Community Survey (ACS). The gender earnings gap is somewhat larger when measured in
terms of annual earnings than when measured in terms of hourly wages. However, the age
patterns of the earnings gap are very similar regardless of the income measure (annual or
weekly).17 Controlling for hours in each equation gives the expected result: the level of the
gender gap varies whether it is measured in annual or weekly earnings, but the age pattern of
the gap itself is unaffected. Thus although hours worked can explain part of the gender
differences in the level of earnings, they do not impact the age patterns. The appendix provides
a short explanation and graphical findings of this analysis based on ACS in 2001-2007.
We conclude that, as we are interested in estimating the age dynamics of the gender
earnings differential, we can proceed with the LEHD-based analysis with more confidence that
it is not the gender divergence in hours worked that is driving the observed age patterns.
Another possible caveat with our data is attrition from people moving out of the 26
PMSAs. This would pose a problem for us if the movements out of the PMSA were
differentially selected across genders. Since our key results are obtained conditional on fixed
individual and establishment effects, heterogeneity in terms of individual or establishment
earnings levels is controlled for in the analysis. However, attrition bias could still affect our

17

The usual caveat regarding self-reported hours of work applies of course, see e.g. Frazis and Stewart, 2004; Abraham,
Spletzer, and Stewart, 1998; Robinson and Bostrom, 1994. Surveys on hours worked may suffer from various response
biases, be non-representative for salaried workers, and/or have reference weeks that are not representative of the typical
monthly or annual average.

10

gender comparisons if there is differential selection in residual earnings growth between men
and women. Although this concern cannot be confronted directly based on our data, we note
that the bias could go either away. We show below that our results are driven mainly by married
individuals. If married women in our sample of PMSAs are disproportionately tied stayers, this
could lead to finding lower wage growth for women. But low (residual) wage growth women
may as likely be tied movers, women who follow their husband as they take better job
opportunities, which would bias our findings in the opposite direction. We also use the ACS
and CPS to evaluate the representativeness of our PMSA sample relative to the entire United
States. We find that the age patterns in the gender earnings differentials are essentially
unchanged as we limit the data to the sample LEHD states instead of the entire country.18
A few final details about the Census RDC data are worth noting. First, all observation
counts in the paper are disguised and rounded to the nearest 100 according to Census Bureau
disclosure restrictions. Second, we generally use the establishment ID (based on the State Tax
ID and the establishment number) to identify work establishments and to track them over time.
The LEHD also includes firm identifiers, but unlike establishment IDs those are not fully
consistent over time within a given firm. For example, if another firm acquires an establishment,
the firm ID will change, even though the workers within that establishment would all continue
their employment with the company. Due to the sheer size and scope of these data it would be
practically impossible to try to follow each of the firms over time while taking into account all
merger activities and other corporate restructuring. Moreover, we believe that the
establishment-level tracking is more relevant for the current purpose because the type of jobto-job moves that is the focus of this paper may involve changes between establishments within
a firm as well.
The dependent variable in our models is the natural logarithm of earnings, where
earnings are measured as the average quarterly earnings during the year (over the quarters that
the person was working). Another key variable is the establishment size, where the size
corresponds to the LEHD reported number of employees minus the sample mean. We also
include a squared-term in age, where the age refers to the person’s age during the year of
observation minus 35 (which is the mid-point of the age range in our sample). Since the
regression specification includes establishment and person fixed effects, most of the other time-

18

These additional analyses are not included here due to space considerations. Results are available from the authors by
request.

11

invariant person and establishment characteristics are absorbed by those fixed effects. In what
follows, we also normalize establishment size to be zero at the sample mean.

II. METHODOLOGY
A. Definitions: Age-Earnings profiles and the Gender Earnings Gap
To derive age-earnings profiles of individuals within and across establishments, we utilize a
simple log earnings model in the style of Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) - AKM
hereafter19 - with individual fixed effects, establishment fixed effects and time varying
covariates. We also allow for a job-specific match effect, where a job is defined as a unique
match between an individual and an establishment. The earnings equation is given by:

at time t, 𝜑 + E($,%) is the establishment fixed effect20 and 𝜉$E($,%) is an idiosyncratic match effect
assumed to be orthogonal to both the individual and the establishment fixed effect, but
potentially correlated with time-varying individual and establishment characteristics (e.g. age
and establishment size) as well as calendar time. The equation also includes a year fixed effect,
𝛾% , and an error term, 𝜀$% , assumed to be orthogonal to all the other variables.
The “individual component” of the earnings equation describes the expected withinjob age earnings profile for a worker i, holding constant characteristics (e.g. cohort) over time
and across employers, and conditional on establishment and match-specific fixed effects.

19

See Abowd et al (1999).
We assume fixed establishment and match effects over the full observation period. This may be a restrictive assumption, in
particular since Barth et al (2016) find an increase in the earnings distribution across establishments over this period. Upward
mobility across establishments may lead to an upward bias in the estimated age-earnings profile within establishments, as
workers may be more likely to be observed above the establishment mean later in the career. There are, however, unresolved
trade-offs in the estimation of time varying two-way fixed effects in this context, and we leave this issue to future research.

The “establishment component” of earnings includes the establishment fixed effect
and an earnings premium associated with the establishment size: 𝜒E($,%)% = 𝛽 + A 𝑙𝑛𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒E($,%) % +
𝜑 + E($,%) . Note that this term changes over time for each individual both because of changes in
the establishment size over time and because 𝜑 + E($,%) changes as the worker moves across
establishments. To capture the age earnings dynamics of this component, we define the
auxiliary regression of the establishment component for individual i of gender g as a function
of age and age squared as follows:
(2)

+

𝜒E($,%)% = 𝑏) + 𝑏 + , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% + 𝑏 + 0 𝐴𝑔𝑒 0 $% + 𝑢$%

Equation (2) defines the expected age profile of the establishment component of earnings for
individual i of gender g. That is, it describes a worker’s life cycle earnings evolution that comes
from changes in establishment size over time and from moving across establishments of
different size and with different establishment fixed effects.
For ease of exposition, we use hereafter the shorthand notation of j instead of j(i,t)
to indicate establishment j where worker i is employed at time t. Therefore, the establishment
fixed effect will be denoted by 𝜑 + E instead of 𝜑 + E($,%) and so on.
Given (1) and (2), we define the age-specific gender earnings gap as the difference,
for given age, between the expected earnings of a woman and a man living in the same PMSA
and with the same education:
(3)

ГV+@ = 𝐸(𝛼$ |𝑓) − 𝐸(𝛼$ |𝑚) + \𝛽 ] , − 𝛽 > , ^𝐴𝑔𝑒 + \𝛽 ] 0 − 𝛽 > 0 ^𝐴𝑔𝑒 0 +

𝐸(𝜒 ] |𝐴𝑔𝑒) − 𝐸(𝜒 > |𝐴𝑔𝑒).
where, 𝐸 (𝛼$ |𝑔), 𝑔 = 𝑓,m is the average individual fixed effect for gender g, and 𝐸 (𝜒+ |𝐴𝑔𝑒)
is the expected establishment earnings component for a person of gender g, as defined above.
Using the auxiliary regression (2) that describes the evolution of the establishment component
by age, we decompose the change in the age specific gender earnings gap between any two
ages, for instance between age 35 and age 25, as:
(4)

where ∆ denotes the difference in the variables as measured between the two ages. Equation (4)
provides a decomposition of the change in the earnings gap between men and women for any
age during their career.21 The first bracket of equation (4) reflects the change in the individual
component of the gender earnings gap by age, arising from different earnings growth over time
among workers who remain in the same establishment, conditional on establishment size. We
explain below how both \𝛽 ] , − 𝛽 > , ^ and \𝛽 ] 0 − 𝛽 > 0 ^ may be identified from the estimation
of (1) using fixed job effects to absorb individual, establishment, and match specific fixed
effects, and adding interaction terms with a gender dummy when appropriate.
The second bracket of equation (4) reflects the changes in the establishment
component of the gender earnings gap, arising from different sorting of men and women across
establishments by age, and from changes in establishment size over time. We discuss below
how both (𝑏 ] , − 𝑏> , ) and (𝑏 ] 0 − 𝑏> 0 ) may be identified from a second stage regression of
the predicted establishment component of equation (1) on age and age square as outlined by
equation (2).
Notably, the widening of the gender earnings gap estimated using a simple OLS
regression, as illustrated in figure I, encompasses both the individual and the establishment
components, as well as any composition effects stemming from different individuals entering
or leaving the sample over time. Since composition effects in terms of individual characteristics
will be taken care of by the inclusion of individual fixed effects in all our models, we focus our
discussion below on the estimation of the individual and the establishment components.

B. Estimation: Identifying the Widening Earnings Gap by Age
We include fixed individual effects in our earnings model, and thus control for cohort fixed
effects in the most flexible way. However, it is well known that it is not possible to separately
identify linear cohort, time, and age effects in any panel model as they will be collinear. For
each individual (or year-cohort), the variables time and age are collinear in the data, and it is
not possible to distinguish between them. We may identify the coefficients of the second order
term for age, 𝛽 + 0 , but we cannot identify the linear term, 𝛽 + , directly.

21

Note that the change in the earnings gap over time does not rely on differences in the expected individual fixed effects for
each gender or any fixed difference in the establishment components as reflected by the constant term in equation (2), as they
are constant over time and thus differenced out.

14

However, as our focus is on the change in the gender earnings gap by age, assuming
common time effects 𝛾% across genders allows us to identify the difference in the linear terms,
\𝛽 ] , − 𝛽 > , ^. According to (4) this is what we need in order to obtain an estimate of the change
of the individual component of the earnings gap:

Step 1:
Summing the individual, establishment, and match fixed effects into a job fixed effect allows
us to rewrite equation (1) as
(1’)

𝑙𝑛𝑤$% = 𝛽) + 𝛽 + , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% + 𝛽 + 0 𝐴𝑔𝑒 0 $% + 𝛽 + A 𝑙𝑛𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒E % + 𝜓 + $E + 𝛾% + 𝜀$%

where 𝜓 + $E = 𝛼$ + 𝜑 + E + 𝜉$E is the job-specific fixed effect. We estimate (1’) by pooling the
data for men and women and run a model where all the time varying covariates are interacted
with a female dummy variable F, and we may write all terms as for instance for age:
𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% + \𝛽 ] , − 𝛽 > , ^ 𝐹𝐴𝑔𝑒$% .
Since age is perfectly correlated with calendar time for each individual, we exclude
the linear part of Age (the first term with the coefficient 𝛽 > , ) from the equation22. We may
however, retain the interaction term between gender and Age, which is not collinear with
calendar time since it is the age for women but zero for men.
Excluding the term for age, 𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% , from the estimation has the consequence
that the linear age effect is absorbed partly by the year dummies and partly by the individual
fixed effects. The new year dummies are given by 𝛾b% = 𝛾% + 𝛽 > , (𝐴𝑔𝑒$% − 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) ) = 𝛾% +
𝛽 > , 𝑡, where 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) is age at the base year (start of the panel) and t is the number of years since
the start of the panel. 𝛾b% is thus fixed across all observations for each calendar year. The new
individual fixed effects are given by: 𝛼b$ = 𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) + 𝛼$ , which is fixed across all
observations for each individual. We easily see that we have absorbed the linear term for age
as 𝛼b$ + 𝛾b% = 𝛼$ + 𝛾% + 𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% . The model we estimate in step 1 is thus:

22
This point is not consistently acknowledged in the literature using fixed effects for individuals and establishments, and
many researchers tend to include a linear age term in models, where it cannot be separately identified, simply as a matter of
habit. This practice may not be of much consequence if age and time are just control variables, but it is crucial for the
discussion of earnings dynamics over time. Moreover, as it will be clear below, the way in which we treat the linear age term
is crucial for the interpretation of the individual fixed effects.

𝑙𝑛𝑤$% = 𝛽d) + \𝛽 ] , − 𝛽 > , ^ 𝐹𝐴𝑔𝑒$% + 𝛽 > 0 𝐴𝑔𝑒 0 $% + \𝛽 ] 0 − 𝛽 > 0 ^ 𝐹𝐴𝑔𝑒 0 $% +

𝛽 > A 𝑙𝑛𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒E% + \𝛽 ] A − 𝛽 > A ^ 𝐹𝑙𝑛𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒E% + 𝜓d e E$ + 𝛾b% + 𝜀$% ,
where 𝜓d e E$ = 𝛼b$ + 𝜑 + E + 𝜉$E is the job fixed effect. 𝛽d) will be determined by the normalization
that the job fixed effects are set to zero for the average person in the estimation sample.
The estimation of equation (1’’) in step 1 provides us with estimates of all
parameters needed to calculate the change in the individual component of the expected gender
gap by age, as defined in equation (4).

Step 2:
In the second step we use the parameters from step one to obtain an estimate of the
establishment component, 𝜒+ E% . To begin the process, we retrieve the fixed job effects, 𝜓d e E$ ,
from equation (1’’), and decompose them into an individual effect and an establishment effect
by the following AKM-type of decomposition:
(5)

𝜓d e E$ = 𝛼hg + 𝜑e E + 𝑢$% ,

which is estimated on the full sample of observations by gender within the PMSA23. Combining
the term for the logarithm of size from the step 1 with the estimated establishment fixed effects
provides us with an estimate of the time varying establishment component of the earnings
premium 𝜒+ E% = 𝛽 + A 𝑙𝑛𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒E % + 𝜑 + E for each observation in the data.
Recall that the establishment component may change over time for each individual
both as firm size changes in a given establishment, conditional on the worker staying, and as
the individual changes jobs into new establishments. The establishment component of the
gender pay gap may thus change both from differential development of expected firm size and
from differential sorting of men and women into different establishments. To obtain estimates
of 𝑏 + J (s=1,2) describing the dynamics of the establishment component of earnings by age, we
run the auxiliary regression (2) separately by gender and education.
For both steps of the analysis, we estimate the parameters of this model by PMSA
and report weighted average estimates over all PMSAs. All parameters are estimated separately

23 We use the REG2HDFE procedure in Stata to do the decomposition. See Guimaraes and Portugal (2009).

16

for each education group, gender and PMSA, with the exception of the time effects that are
assumed to be equal across genders within each education/PMSA cell, and establishment fixed
effects that are assumed to be equal for each education group, but allowed to vary across gender
and PMSA. In addition to the orthogonality of the error term24 𝜀$% , this is all we require to
identify the change in the gender earnings gap by age for each education group and to
decompose it into its individual and establishment components.
The key assumption for the identification of the widening of the individual
component of the gender earnings gap by age is that the time effects are set to be equal across
genders. Technically, this assumption ensures that the time fixed effects drop out of equation
(3), which defines the gender earnings gap by age. This assumption implies that any year-toyear changes in labor market conditions affect men and women in the same birth cohort and
education group and PMSA similarly over the period (1995-2008). We argue that this
assumption is reasonable in our application.25 The alternative, a common cohort effect across
genders, seems questionable, given the gender convergence in labor market outcomes across
the 33 cohorts included in our study.26 As documented by Goldin (2016), women have made
major inroads in terms of labor market participation, occupational segregation, and earnings
across these cohorts, surpassing men in educational attainment. In contrast, such changes have
been much more modest within specific birth cohorts as they aged during the observation
period. Finally, while the gender pay gap shrank drastically in the 1970s and 1980s (affecting
the earliest cohorts in our analysis), it has remained practically unchanged over our period.
Comparing the gender pay gap by age for different cohorts over time may help
assess whether the assumption is realistic. Consider the alternative to our key assumption,
namely the case where the trend over calendar time is less steep for women than for men and
where the widening of the gender pay gap that we observe within each cohort is attributable to
a widening over calendar time rather than by age within each cohort. In this case, the gender
pay gap measured at different ages would be increasing in calendar time. For instance, the
earnings gap for 27 year old in 2005 would be wider than the earnings gap observed for 27 year
old in 2000, and so on. Figure III, which presents the development of the average gender
earnings gap over time for different birth cohorts, does not seem to support such a scenario. In
24 See Card et al. (2016) for a discussion of this assumption in a two-way fixed effect model of workers and establishments.
25
While the Great Recession of 2009 (outside our sample period) has been noted to have differential effects on employment
by gender, the 2000 recession (the main recession within our sample) was very gender neutral (Mishel et al. 2003: table 3.7;
BLS 2007; BLS 2009).
26
Our data comprises workers in age group 25-45 during the 13 years from 1995 to 2008, they are thus born from 1950 to
1983.

17

the figure, each line represents the gap in average earnings for each cohort as they are observed
in subsequent cross sections of the CPS.27 Cohorts are labelled by the year when they reach 25
to 29 years of age.28
We make three observations. First, the differences between cohorts measured at a
particular age and thus at different calendar times, seem small relative to the earnings growth
by age for each cohort, particularly among workers with college. Second, it is not the case that
the earnings gap, measured at a given age, is consistently smaller in the earlier cohorts that are
observed at earlier points in time. Ranking the gender earnings gap at age 27 in ascending order,
we observe the smallest gap for 27 year old in 2010, followed by 1995 and 2005. The largest
gender earnings gap at age 27 is observed in 2000. Third, the ranking of the cohorts is not
consistent across age groups. For instance, at age 37, the 2000 cohort has the lowest gender
earnings gap. It is, of course, possible to construct combinations of gender specific trends offset
by time-varying cohort effects that would partially reconcile these observations, but there is
nothing in the raw data that suggests that differences in calendar time trends across genders is
a noteworthy contributor to the widening of the gender earnings gap over the life course.
Finally, note that even if the common time effects assumption is not valid, our
decomposition into individual and establishment components nevertheless would remain valid
and meaningful. However, the external validity and interpretation of the results would be
different: If a differential time trend adds to the widening of the gender earnings gap over time,
we would expect new cohorts to come in with a higher gap, and we would not be able to
distinguish between developments over the observation period that affect men and women of
the same birth cohort differentially versus differential developments over the career purely due
to age.

C. Extension: Age-Earnings Profiles and the Return to Seniority
So far, we have been concerned with the widening of the gender earnings gap by age. However,
if we want to identify separate age-earnings profiles for each gender, we also need to identify
𝛽 > , , the baseline linear part of earnings growth for men. As explained above, when removing
the linear term for age in equation (1’’), the individual fixed effect may be reformulated as 𝛼b$ =

27

The figure shows gender earnings gaps at different ages calculated from the data illustrated in figure II and discussed in
appendix 2.

18

𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) + 𝛼$ where 𝛼$ incorporates cohort effects. To identify an age effect as distinct from
a linear trend in the cohort effects, we need an additional assumption. We have chosen to
represent the cohort effects for men by their decade of birth, assuming that among men the
cohort effect is the same for all men born during the same decade29. We thus obtain an estimate
of 𝛽 > , from the equation:
(6)

𝛼b$ = 𝛼< + 𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) + 𝛼$

where 𝛼< represents cohort fixed effects associated with decade of birth. In practice, we retrieve
the individual fixed effects from the AKM decomposition of the job fixed effects (equation 4)
in step 2 and regress them on “age at the beginning of panel” and the cohort fixed effects. Note
that we do not need to treat the cohort effects for women similarly, since we already have an
unbiased estimator for the difference between the linear age effects for men and women. We
think an assumption of decade-by-decade cohort effects would be less realistic for women since
the evolution of their labor force participation and pay was more dramatic even within a cohort
decade. We thus obtain an estimate of the linear part of women’s earnings profile 𝛽 ] , by adding
the estimated coefficient for males from the step 1 estimate (equation 1’’) of the difference
\𝛽 ] , − 𝛽 > , ^.
An alternative would be to follow the procedure used by Card et al. (2013) and
assume that the earnings profile of men reaches its apex at 40 years of age.30 We believe that
this assumption would also seem somewhat arbitrary in our application, since the linear part of
women’s earnings profile might top at a later age than 40 due to career interruptions during the
prime age years. To sum up, our preferred estimate comes from equation (6), but when
presenting results on earnings growth by group, we do report numbers using both of the
alternative procedures.
Another extension arises from the possibility that the within-establishment earnings
growth may contain elements that are carried on from one job to the next (i.e. a general
component), and other elements that are unique to the current job but lost once the individual
changes establishment (i.e. an establishment-specific seniority premium). If this is the case the

29 Note that since we include job fixed effects in our first step, the individual fixed effects and thus the cohort effects are
estimated conditional on establishment fixed effects. Any differences that allocate some cohorts into better paying firms or
establishments over time is thus controlled for, and what we are addressing here is cohort effects on the distribution of
earnings within firms.
30
In our case this is done by calculating 𝛽>, = -10𝛽> 0, since we have normalized age to be zero at 35 in our data.

19

within-establishment age earnings profiles can be decomposed into a seniority profile and a
general age-earnings profile, even when conditioning on the establishment fixed effect.
Empirically, it is difficult to identify the effect of seniority on earnings, in particular
because a job match entailing a positive earnings premium for the worker is likely to last longer
than matches with lower pay. However, in our case this common concern is taken care of by
the introduction of job fixed effects. With the fixed effects, though, it is not possible to separate
the linear terms for age and seniority within jobs, even if we assume the common time effects
for each gender31. To separately identify the age and seniority profiles for each gender we rely
on individuals with more than one job observed during the sample period. To simplify the
following exposition, we ignore all variables that vary independently within each job, such as
age squared and firm size. Consider the simplified within-job earnings equation:
(7)

𝑙𝑛𝑤$% = 𝛽) + 𝛽 + , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% + 𝛽 + A 𝑆$E% + 𝜓 + $E + 𝛾% + 𝑒$% ,

where S is the number of years in current establishment. We follow the same procedure as
above, representing the model with a gender interaction term and removing the linear part of
age. Note that 𝐴𝑔𝑒$% − 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) = 𝑆$E% − 𝑆$E) = 𝑡, where 𝑆$E) is seniority for individual i in
establishment j at the beginning of the panel. We may then rewrite (7) as follows:
(7’)

𝑙𝑛𝑤$% = 𝛽) + \𝛽 ] , + 𝛽 ] A − 𝛽 > , − 𝛽 > A ^𝐹𝐴𝑔𝑒$% + 𝜓i + $E + 𝛾b% + 𝑒$% ,

where it is clear that we can identify the linear term \𝛽 ] , + 𝛽 ] 0 − 𝛽 > , − 𝛽 > 0 ^ only. We have
𝛾b% = 𝛾% + (𝛽 > , + 𝛽 > A )𝑡, 𝜓i + E$ = 𝛼b$ + 𝛽 + 0 𝑆$E) + 𝜑 + E + 𝜉$E and as before 𝛼b$ = 𝛽 > , 𝐴𝑔𝑒$) +
𝛼$ . We may thus identify 𝛽 > A and 𝛽 ] A from the gender specific equations32.
(8)

𝜓i + E$ = 𝛼b$ + 𝛽 + 0 𝑆$E) + 𝜑 + E + 𝜔$E

where the identification of 𝛽 + A comes from individuals who hold two or more jobs only. Again
we may obtain the benchmark linear term for men using (6)33.

31

It is possible, however, to directly identify the non-linear parts of the seniority profile in the within job specification (1’’).
This will be added in the next revision of the paper, once we can apply renewed access to the data based on an invitation to
revise and resubmit the paper to an academic journal (as per Census Bureau regulations).
32
Again, we use REG2HDFE.
33
An added complication arises since we only observe seniority from the beginning of our panel. This means that the Age0
variable captures the effect of seniority at the beginning of the panel as well. We make a correction for this by estimating for
each gender-education group how much seniority grows by age using survey data (CPS March 2000) containing information
nA τp), where b is coefficient for Age0 in (6), and τ is
on seniority (job tenure), and calculate β, from the equation bm, = (β, + β
the coefficient for age in a regression of seniority on age from the survey. The first part is the coefficient for age in the model,
nA τp, up to Age0. The coefficient τ is
β, , that we are after, whereas the second part is the contribution from seniority, β
estimated to be 0.31 for no-college women, 0.34 for college women, and 0.41 for men, irrespective of education. We use the

20

To sum up: The widening of the within establishment gender earnings gap by age
is estimated directly from a within job log earnings regression for each gender, using an
assumption of common time effects to identify the age profile of the gap. The widening of the
establishment component of the gender earnings gap by age is estimated by regressing the
predicted establishment component from the same regression on age, separately by gender. We
make two extensions: To obtain the gender specific age-earnings profiles within establishments
that we show in figure III below, we add an estimate of the linear age term for men by regressing
the individual fixed effects on age at the beginning of the panel and cohort effects defined by
decade of birth. Finally, we add an estimate of the seniority part of the age-earnings profile
using individuals observed with two different jobs in the panel.

III. RESULTS
III A. A large part of the increasing earnings gap occurs within establishments
Figure IV shows the predicted age-earnings profiles obtained from separate regressions with
fixed individual and establishment effects as outlined above. The models include year effects
as well. The figure illustrates the evolution of earnings over time for the same individual,
keeping the contribution from the establishment component unchanged, relative to a 25-yearold of the same gender and educational group. Note that, given the large sample size, all
coefficients are estimated very precisely. This is why we do not report standard errors in the
figures and tables (see data section for details).
Once again, we find a much steeper profile for college-educated workers, in particular
for men. An average college educated man improves his earnings by 57 log points going from
age 25 to age 45, while a college educated woman improves her earnings only by 27 log points.
The first takeaway of our analysis is thus that for college-educated workers, a considerable part
of the growth in the gender earnings gap occurs within establishments.
For workers without a college degree, however, the within establishment earnings gap
increases over the first 10 years but then narrows considerably over time as the earnings profile
for men flattens out. By age 45 women without a college degree more than catch up to similarly

CPS Job Tenure data for the March 2000 CPS supplement provided by the CEPR (http://ceprdata.org/cps-uniform-dataextracts/cps-job-tenure/cps-job-tenure-data/) and estimate the model for workers between 25 and 45 years of age.

21

educated men. Their earnings grow by 28 log points over the 20-year period, while men’s
earnings increase only by 25 log points.
Table I quantifies the change in the gender earnings gap within establishments for
different age intervals. Among the non-college educated, we find that men have faster earnings
growth within establishments until the age of 35, but women catch up in terms of earnings
growth after that. By age 45 their accumulated earnings growth is 3 log points higher than
men’s. Among the college educated, men have faster earnings growth up to age 40, followed
by some catching up by women between ages 40 and 45 as the male earnings profile flattens
out. However, by age 45 college educated men have a 30 log points advantage in accumulated
earnings growth relative to women in the same education group.

III.B. Seniority and age profiles
Next, we decompose the within-establishment earnings growth into the component that is
purely due to seniority within a firm, i.e. the part of earnings growth that is lost when a person
changes jobs, and the component of within establishment earnings growth that is retained also
when changing jobs. Table II displays the estimated returns to seniority, measured as the
relative earnings gain from one year of additional tenure within the same establishment. We
find that men have a higher return to seniority than women, particularly among the college
educated.
The remaining part of the within-establishment earnings growth by age, that is retained
when changing jobs, is found by subtracting the average contribution from the return to
seniority, calculated using average seniority by age, education and gender34, from the overall
within-establishment earnings profile as displayed in Figure II. Conditional on seniority and the
establishment fixed effect, the age profile measures the improvement in the relative earnings
within the establishment that a person retains even when changing jobs. An example of a
positive within-establishment earnings change would be a person low in the earnings hierarchy
of one establishment who changes jobs to a position higher up in the earnings hierarchy of
another establishment. Figure V illustrates how the within-establishment seniority and age

34

See the methodology section for details. As discussed there, it is possible also to identify non-linear terms for the seniority
profile in the within job specification (1’’). The current results are based on a linear specification in seniority, and the
distribution of earnings growth allocated to age and seniority may be sensitive to this restriction.

22

profiles interact for a person who changes job every fifth year, using college educated men and
women as an example.
Both the seniority and age profiles contribute to the widening of the withinestablishment earnings gap over time, particularly for college educated workers. In Table III
we show the contribution to the development of the gender earnings gap over time from the
within-establishment age and seniority profiles, separately. The seniority wage contribution is
constant over time as the returns to seniority only has a linear term, whereas the age term is
allowed to change over time. The contribution of gender differentials in returns to seniority to
the widening of the pay gap is twice as large among the college-educated than among workers
without a college degree.
In the beginning of the career, the age profile is steeper for men than for women, and
dominates as a source of increasing pay gap, particularly for college educated workers. This
means that men, in addition to having steeper earnings growth within establishments, also gain
more in terms of relative earnings within establishments when they change jobs. As people age,
the age profile in particular for men, dips to negative, and contributes to a narrowing of the
gender earnings pay gap.

III.C. The establishment component of the gender earnings gap increases with age
The establishment component of earnings is the sum of the coefficient of the fixed
establishment effect and the component of earnings that is attributable to firm size. It measures
an establishment earnings premium, or how much more (or less) the employer pays an
individual worker over and above the average establishment in the economy. The widening of
the gap in the establishment component as individuals age provides a key finding in this paper:
It shows the differential contribution for men and women arising from changes in establishment
characteristics and job-to-job changes across employers with different establishment earnings
premiums during their prime working age years. Figure VI shows the development of the
establishment earnings component over time, compared to a person of 25 years of age with the
same gender and education.
We find a rising age-earnings profile in the establishment component for both college
and non-college workers. An average college educated man gains 21 log points from age 25 to
45 in terms of the establishment earnings component, while a college educated woman on

23

average gains 10 log points. Non-college men experience a growth of 17 log points, whereas
the number for women is 12 log points.
Table IV shows the contribution to the widening gender earnings gap that comes from
the shifting distribution of pay across establishments. For non-college educated workers, the
establishment contribution is largest in the beginning, suggesting that men disproportionately
move into higher paying establishments early in their career. For college educated workers, the
difference is larger and more evenly spread across age intervals. The gender gap in the average
establishment earnings premium increases by 5 log points going from age 25 to age 45 for noncollege workers and 11 log points for college workers.
Next, we quantify the contribution of the individual and establishment component to the
widening of the gender gap. Table V reports the total change in the gender earnings gap by age
(column 1 and 3) and the share attributable to the establishment component (column 2 and 4).
Among workers without a college degree, the total earnings gap widens from age 25 to 30, and
from age 30 to age 35. The share arising from an increasing establishment earnings premium is
28 and 57 percent, respectively. For college workers, the total gender earnings gap increases in
all age intervals up to 40 years of age. The share of the establishment contribution increases
from 13 percent during the first 5 years to 41 percent between age 35 and 40.
Up to age 40, about 56 percent of the accumulated gender gap in earnings growth for
non-college educated workers, and about 20 percent of the accumulated gender gap for the
college-educated is due to differential growth in the establishment component of pay. The
remaining parts are due to differential earnings growth in the individual component.
We further investigate the role of marital status in explaining the widening of the gender
earnings gap arising from earnings differentials across establishments. Figure VII displays the
predicted establishment earnings premium by age for married and never married (as of 2000)
men and women. Interestingly, although not surprisingly, the bulk of the increase in the
establishment earnings gap over the life cycle is driven by the behavior of married men and
women. Consider college educated workers first. The earnings path for married and nonmarried men is very similar, but so is also the earnings path of non-married women. The
difference in the growth of the establishment component of pay seems to be entirely driven by
the lower growth among married women. For non-college workers, the pattern is similar, but
less pronounced. Again, the dominant part of the difference between men and women arises
from lower growth among married women.

III.D. Additional considerations
Given that the LEHD data are sparse in many variables that are often available in survey data
sets such as the CPS, we cannot easily quantify how much of the gender pay gap increase is
due to gender differences in hours worked, prevalence of part-time work, differential
accumulation of work experience with age and so on. Instead, our findings relate to the overall
gap in earnings having controlled for worker and firm fixed effects. We acknowledge that any
and all of these factors might contribute to the pay gap patterns documented in this paper. For
example, to the extent that women take more career breaks around the time of family formation,
that would help explain why they experience less of a benefit from changing jobs. While we
cannot directly tackle this issue we experimented with alternative selection rules that limit the
sample to workers who are more strongly attached to the labor market. For example, we
required workers to be present at least 50% or 80% of the time or restricted the sample to
individuals observed in the data for 5 or 10 consecutive years. In all cases, we found that the
increase in the earnings gap over time (and the pattern between the individual and establishment
components) were very similar regardless of the sample selection criteria. 35
Finally, previous studies have shown that the number of hours worked can explain a
large part of the overall gender pay gap, and in many occupations can be an important
determinant of earnings (Goldin, 2014). Since we only have data on usual hours worked as of
2000 we are unable to tease out the importance of hours in our dynamic analysis. However, in
cross-sectional analyses for year 2000 we found that the usual hours worked are positively
related to earnings and can explain about 20 to 25 percent of the gender pay gap in the crosssection, depending on specification and occupations included.36

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The gender earnings gap widens considerably during the first two decades of working life. This
widening is much stronger among college-educated workers than among workers without a
college degree. Also, when controlling for cohort effects, the earnings growth from age 25 to
45 of men and women with a college degree is similar to the development depicted in figure I.
35

The trade-off is that the sample size shrinks considerably the stricter the criteria used.
We also checked how much of the 2008 pay gap the usual hours in the 2000 Decennial Census could explain,
and found that the estimated gender pay gap was reduced by about 16 percent when including a control for the
usual work hours 8 years previous.
36

25

College educated men on average experience a wage growth of 110 percent, while women
experience 39 percent earnings growth over the same period. In comparison, the difference
between the earnings growth of men and women without a college degree is minimal:
Controlling for cohort effects, men without a college degree on average experience an earnings
growth of 52 percent, very similar to women’s earnings growth of 49 percent. This deviates
from the pattern for non-college workers in figure I, which shows a widening of the gender
earnings pay gap by age groups in the cross sections. This different pattern suggests that
younger cohorts of non-college women have improved their position relative to the older
cohorts of non-college women, in comparison to men with the same age and education.
In order to assess the extent to which the widening of the pay gap over a worker’s career
is associated with the organization of firms and advancements in job ladders within firms, or
with different earnings distributions and job-to-job mobility patterns across establishments, we
decomposed it into an individual and an establishment component.
Over time, an individual may improve his or her position within the establishment by
climbing the corporate ladder. When changing employer, this improvement may be transferred
over to the new employer or even enhanced, or it may be lost as in a game of chutes and ladders.
The seniority profile captures the earnings growth within a job that is lost when changing
employer, while the within-establishment age profile, conditional on seniority, captures the
within-establishment earnings growth that is maintained even when changing employer. In
terms of earnings growth within establishments, college educated men stand out with a
significantly higher earnings growth than all the other groups. Relative to women, men have
both steeper seniority profiles, on average longer seniority, and experience a steeper ageearnings profile within establishments, conditional on seniority. Men’s relative advantage in
terms of earnings advances within the establishment is particularly large during the early career;
after 10 years the earnings gap has widened by 29 log points. From 40 to 45 women catch up
some of the advantage, amounting to 5.4 log points.
The establishment earnings premium also changes over time for each individual. This
change adds significantly to the widening of the gender earnings gap, especially for the college
educated. Men climb the establishment ladder faster than women. From 25 to 45 years of age,
the establishment earnings component grows by 21 log points among college educated men,
and by 10 log points for college educated women. This part of the increase of the gender
earnings gap is entirely different from the individual component. While the individual
component originates from the combination of the management determined job structure within
26

firms, and the workers’ competition to climb the ladder, the establishment component originates
from the combination of options that arise in the marketplace and the workers’ job mobility
patterns. Gender differences in the growth of the establishment component arise from
differences in the probability of job-to-job transitions and differences in the earnings gain
associated with such job changes. A voluntary job move is likely to be associated with earnings
gains, whereas involuntary or “tied” moves are more likely to be associated with an earnings
loss. Speculatively, if women are disproportionately ‘tied movers’ (i.e. change jobs/location to
follow the “primary earner” in the family) this could explain the widening of the gap that arises
from the between component (see e.g. Cooke et al., 2009). What we have accounted for in this
paper is the combined result of such differences.
We find that almost all the difference in the growth of the establishment component of
pay across genders is due to differences by marital status. Whereas the difference between men
and women in the growth of the establishment component is small among non-married
employees, there is a large widening of the gender gap for the married. This pattern is
particularly strong among college educated workers: At 45 years of age, a married college
educated man has gained more than 20 log points of earnings, whereas a married college
educated woman gains on average less than 5 log points. These results suggest that among
married couples, the household division of labor tend to limit women’s career choices with
respect to job-to-job changes and this is an important determinant of the widening of the gender
earnings gap, especially for college educated women who are more likely to be in occupations
with steep age-earnings profiles. Evidence based on the publicly available 2000 Census (not
reported) suggests that this is linked to the arrival of children, which is especially costly for
couples where both partners are college educated. Our linked employer-employee data allow
further exploration and (potentially) identification of the underlying mechanisms because
unlike in other linked data, spouses (as of 2000) are matched, providing data on the
demographic characteristics of both spouses and the presence and age of children. Because of
limitations in data access we are currently unable to investigate this further, but plan to do that
in future work.

Appendix 2: Current Population Survey (CPS) Based Analyses
To study the impact of hours worked on the age-wage profile by gender, cohort and educational
attainment we use data from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) augmented with
information on annual earnings from wage and salary, usual hours worked per week and weeks
worked per year from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). The ASEC
information is for the previous fiscal year. Therefore, in keeping with our main sample, we
select individuals aged 26 to 45 in the years 1995 to 2012. We further select the sample to
include only observations with non-missing values for all the variables of interest. Individuals
are grouped in two education categories (College, No College) based on whether the higher
level of education completed is a bachelor degree or more. We consider two earnings concepts:
Quarterly earnings (annual earnings divided by four) and an hourly wage, which is obtained by
dividing annual earnings by the product of usual hours worked per week and weeks worked per
year. Earnings are converted in 2008 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer
Price Index (for all urban consumers) for the years 1995-2012. Averages by age-cohort-gendereducation are computed using individual weights for the ASEC sample. In this appendix we
compare the age profiles by earnings concept, gender and cohort for individuals who did not
complete college. The statistics for college graduates are presented in Figure II in the main text.

Appendix 3: American Community Survey (2001-2007) Based Analyses
To study the impact of hours worked on the age pattern of gender pay gaps, we use 2001-2007
American Community Survey (ACS) data. Those are the years for which weeks worked are
available in a continuous (not categorical) variable in the ACS. We limit the sample to
individuals aged 25-50, who are employed, work for wages, and earn at least $2,000 per year.
We drop individuals who have annual earnings greater than one million dollars per year. Just
like in the main analyses reported in this paper, we separately analyze college educated
individuals and those who do not have a college degree.
We use three main earnings concepts: annual earnings, weekly earnings, and hourly wages. All
are expressed in natural logarithms. We estimate models where we interact gender with age
group dummies, and control for time and state fixed effects. Since the ACS does not have
information on the establishment each person works at we instead estimate a version where we
also include controls for the 3-digit NAICS industry and 2-digit occupation. The figures below
contrast the estimates for gender earnings gap when no control for hours worked is included in
the models versus a version with the hours worked control. We report the results for the overall
sample and by marital status (married, never married).
Not very surprisingly, one key observation is that the usual hours worked affect the estimated
level of the gender earnings gap in annual earnings and weekly wages. Men work, on average,
a greater number of hours than the average female employee, and this explains part of the gender
pay gap. A much smaller impact from hours worked is evident in the hourly wage graph.
However, regardless of the income concept used, the shape of the age pattern in the gender pay
gap is not impacted by the inclusion / exclusion of the hours worked variable. This is true for
both the college-educated and non-college educated sample. In other words, we see a widening
gender pay gap with age, whether or not we control for the hours worked and regardless of the
income concept adopted.
