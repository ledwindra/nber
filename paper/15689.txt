Asymmetric Information and the Demand for Voluntary Health Insurance in Europe
Kristian Bolin, Daniel Hedblom, Anna Lindgren, and Bjorn Lindgren
NBER Working Paper No. 15689
January 2010
JEL No. D82,I1
ABSTRACT
Several past studies have found health risk to be negatively correlated with the probability of voluntary
health insurance. This is contrary to what one would expect from standard textbook models of adverse
selection and moral hazard. The two most common explanations to the counter-intuitive result are
either (1) that risk-aversion is correlated with health — i.e. that healthier individuals are also more
risk-averse — or (2) that insurers are able to discriminate among customers based on observable health-risk
characteristics. We revisited these arguments, using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement
in Europe (SHARE). Self-assessed health served as an indicator of risk: better health, lower risk. We
did, indeed, observe a negative correlation between risk and insurance but found no evidence of heterogeneous
risk-preferences as an explanation to our finding.

1. Introduction
All health-care policy reforms involving voluntary health insurance need to
address the problem of asymmetric information. As a cause of adverse selection
and moral hazard, asymmetric information between the buyer and the seller poses
a serious problem for the functioning of the voluntary health insurance market. In
both research and practice, this problem has chiefly been considered in the
context of the United States market for health insurance. Nonetheless, voluntary
health insurance exists in all European countries—despite the predominance of
social insurance or tax-financed systems. European voluntary health insurance
serves many different functions; allowing faster treatment, a broader choice of
hospitals, and better amenities. The voluntary contracts generally constitute
additional insurance, above and beyond the coverage supplied by the mandatory
system. 1
Policy-makers may view voluntary health insurance as a vehicle for easing the
public burden of health-care financing. Several countries have seen attempts to
introduce more private elements in the financing of health care, but their share has
remained fairly small (OECD, 2004). However, the long-term sustainability of
publicly financed health care will soon be challenged by demographic changes—
more dramatic in some countries than in others (Klevmarken and Lindgren,
2008). As a result of these changes, the market for voluntary health insurance
might drastically aggrandize—not only in Europe but in all OECD countries
(OECD, 2004). From a public policy perspective, it is therefore crucial to possess
firm knowledge about individual characteristics that are correlates to holdings of
voluntary health insurance. Do high-risk individuals self-select into voluntary
health insurance or are insurers able to discriminate among customers and offer
different insurance contracts?

1 Be that social insurance, a national health‐service system, or—for that matter—mandatory
private insurance as in Switzerland.

We addressed this question with an empirical investigation of the determinants of
voluntary health insurance holdings in ten European countries, using data from
the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The SHARE
database offers rich information on health and health-related behavior of the 50+
population of a number of European countries. 2 In particular, we analyzed the
correlation between health-related risk and holdings of voluntary health insurance.
If the European markets for voluntary health insurance were characterized by
asymmetric information, we would expect people with higher ex ante health-risk
levels to be more inclined to purchase voluntary health insurance than their lowrisk counterparts. By adopting the not too far-fetched assumption that future
health (and thereby also future healthcare needs) is partly determined by a
stochastic process with a variance depending negatively on current health, we can
view the risk insured by voluntary health insurance as depending negatively on
health.
A well-known result from the theoretical insurance literature states that when
asymmetric information prevails, it will not be profitable for an insurer to offer all
individuals a contract based on the average risk of the population as a whole (see,
for example, Rotschild and Stiglitz, 1976). Because of the lower expected benefit
of buying insurance for individuals with relatively low risk, they are more likely
to remain uninsured than individuals with relatively high risks. The insurance
pool will eventually consist of an adverse selection of the population with a
higher-than-average risk level. As a consequence, the insurer will have to increase
premiums in order to cover increasing costs, which will force even more low-risk
See the web page, http://www.share‐project.org/, and the next section on the data used in
this study. SHARE data has recently been used, for example, in studies of the utilization of
formal and informal care among the elderly of Europe (Bolin et al., 2008; Bonsang 2009), the
utilization of physician services (Bolin et al., 2009), education‐related inequality in physical
health (Jürges, 2009), supply and demand effects on influenza vaccination (Maurer,,2009),
socio‐economic status and health inequalities in Mediterranean countries (Verropoulou and
Tsimbos, 2007), socio‐economic status and waiting times (Siciliani and Verzulli, 2009),
impact of children on their parents’ mental health (Buber and Engelhardt, 2008), and the
health of immigrants in Europe (Solé‐Auró and Crimmins, 2008).

individuals out of the insurance pool. Consequently, standard textbook models of
adverse selection and moral hazard predict that the (ex-post) average risk-level
among those holding voluntary insurance to be higher than the average population
risk. We would, therefore, expect a positive correlation between health-risk and
voluntary health insurance and—since health-risk was assumed to be negatively
dependent on health—a negative correlation between self-assessed health and
insurance.
Even though some past empirical studies have, indeed, found support for the
theoretical prediction of a positive correlation between risk and insurance—for
example, with data from the British annuity market (Finkelstein and Poterba,
2004), and the U.S. market for supplemental medical insurance for the elderly
(Ettner, 1997)—empirical studies of the demand for voluntary health insurance
generally fail to find support for such a relationship (see, for example, Cawley
and Philipson, 1999; Chiappori and Salanie, 2000; Finkelstein and McGarry,
2003; and Doiron et al., 2008). Insured tend to be healthier, younger, more
educated, and richer than the uninsured (Doiron et al., 2008). Low-risk
individuals simply seem to be more willing to purchase coverage in addition to
the level offered by the mandatory scheme.
The empirical literature has furnished two distinct sets of explanations to this
finding. First, individual risk may be correlated with risk preference (Finkelstein
and McGarry, 2003; Doiron et al., 2008). This would mean that individuals with
better health are more risk-averse than individuals with relatively bad health. The
rationale for this assumption is that, the more risk-averse an individual becomes,
the more inclined he or she will be to undertake precautionary measures with
regards to health; to invest more in health. These health-investments may take the
form of exercise or absence of smoking or alcohol (i.e. lack of disinvestments).
Greater investments in health lead to both better self-assessed health and fewer
observable medical conditions. Since risk-averse individuals are also more likely
to obtain voluntary health insurance, the observed negative correlation between
3

risk and insurance might possibly be an effect of those individuals’ risk
preferences. If this is the case, we would expect observable health conditions—
such as diagnosed diseases—to decrease self-assessed health but to increase the
probability of insurance. A competing explanation to the findings that individual
risk seems to be negatively correlated with insurance is that insurers are able to
offer more attractive contracts to low-risk individuals, by discriminating on the
basis of observable characteristics (Shmueli, 2001). If so, we would expect
observable health conditions to decrease both self-assessed health and the
probability of insurance.
Our study was essentially carried out in a two-step process. In the first step, we
estimated a series of probit-models to see whether we could find the negative
correlation between health-risk and probability of insurance. Self-assessed health
served as an indicator of risk: better health, lower risk. In order to limit the effects
of framing and at what point in the SHARE survey questionnaire the question
about self-assessed health was asked, two different versions of self-assessedhealth questions were used. We started with a simple specification of the
estimation model, comprising only health-risk as an explanatory variable. In
similarity to previous studies, we—indeed—found a negative correlation,
irrespective of version. We then estimated a series of specifications, in which
subsequent specification comprised a larger set of explanatory variables (country,
demographics, health and risk-related behavior), chosen on the basis of previous
empirical research (Ettner, 1997; Hurd and McGarry, 1997; Smith and Kington,
1997; Perry and Rosen, 2004; Doiron et al., 2008). The negative correlation
persisted.
In the second step, we tried to answer the question whether the negative
correlation was a result of heterogeneous risk preferences among insured
individuals or screening on behalf of the insurer. To do so, we omitted the selfassessed health variables from the probit-model and estimated a model with only
countries, demographics, and observable health characteristics as explanatory
4

variables. Subsequently, we estimated an ordered probit model with the same
explanatory variables, but with self-assessed health as dependent variable. This
process was carried out on both versions of the questions. By comparing the effect
of observable health characteristics on self-assessed health to those on the
probability of insurance, we concluded that observable conditions (e.g. diagnosed
chronic conditions) generally seemed to reduce both self-assessed health and the
probability of insurance. Hence, we did not find support for the heterogeneous
risk-preference explanation of the negative correlation between risk and
insurance.

2. Data: sources and description
All data were obtained from the SHARE—a multidisciplinary and cross-national
micro database. The SHARE follows the design of the US Health and Retirement
Study (HRS), and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). 3 The
database currently contains information from 12 countries, comprising a total of
approximately 32,000 individuals above 50 years of age and their household
members. We used data from 10 of the countries covered by the first wave of
SHARE, conducted in 2004: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. 4 Data from the Netherlands were
excluded, because the structure of its health insurance system differs from the
other countries to such an extent that it does not allow for a viable comparison. 5
Our dataset included information on a number of health-related variables (e.g.
self-assessed health, chronic symptoms and psychological health), labor-market
SHARE data set is introduced in Börsch‐Supan, Brugiavini et al. (2005). Methodological
details can be found in Börsch‐Supan and Jürges (2005).

conditions (such as present job characteristics and opportunities to work past
retirement age), education, sources of current income, wealth, consumption, etc.
The overall response rates varied substantially between countries, ranging from
38 percent in Switzerland to 69 percent in France, with an average for all
participating countries of 62 percent.
Data on self-assessed health and holdings of voluntary health insurance were
central to our study. However, some individuals did not answer the SHARE
questionnaire questions about these two variables. Thus, after omitting
observations with missing values, we were left with 25,390 observations. They
were unevenly spread among the countries, ranging from 1000 (Switzerland) to
3817 (Belgium).
2.1. Dependent variable
The dependent variable measured whether the respondent held any kind of
voluntary health insurance. It took the value 1, if the respondent had any
voluntary health insurance, and 0 otherwise. In the English language version of
the SHARE questionnaire, the question was formulated: ”Do you have any
voluntary, supplementary or private health insurance for at least one of the
following types of care in order to complement for the care offered by the national
health service?” (and the corresponding wording for the other languages). The
respondent was then free to answer either yes or no to a number of different
voluntary health-insurance contracts. The insurance would be either for full
hospital costs, drugs expenses, direct access to specialists, extended choice of
doctors, or for dental care. Table 1 shows the frequency of voluntary healthinsurance coverage by country. Voluntary coverage varied from 78.7 percent in
France to a mere 2.2 percent in Sweden. A total of 6693 (approximately 26.4
percent) individuals in the full dataset had some form of voluntary health
insurance.

2.2. Independent variables
Table 2 provides a list of all independent variables and descriptive statistics. In
the first step of the study, we were interested in the effect of health risk on the
likelihood of holding voluntary health insurance. In order to infer this effect, we
also had to account for other possible determinants. In addition to self-assessed
health as an indicator of health-risk, there were three groups of control variables,
reflecting demographics, health and health-related behavior, and country.
[Table 2 about here]
Health-risk (self-assessed health)
The key independent variable was health-risk, for which self-assessed health was
used as a proxy. 6 Two different sets of self-assessed health variables were
available and used in parallel estimations. 7 Thus, all SHARE respondents were
asked to report how their health corresponded to two separate sets of given
alternatives. This was done both in the beginning and at the end of the physicalhealth module. Following the notation of the SHARE questionnaire, we refer to
the two different sets as the “European” and as the “American” version. The order
of the two sets of questions was randomized among respondents. In both versions,
the question was asked: ”Would you say that your health is...”. The alternatives
Self‐assessed health seems to be generally considered to be a reasonable proxy for health
risk, with the merit of capturing effects of undiagnosed conditions and social and mental
well‐being (see, for instance, Wagstaff and van Doorslaer, 1994; Hurd and McGarry, 1995;
and Gerdtham et al., 1999).

6

This was done in order to analyze the robustness of results. There may be problems
regarding how to interpret responses to the self‐assessed questions, of course. Interviews
were, for instance, performed in several languages, and there may be systematic variance between
countries concerning the way health-related questions were perceived. Moreover, cultural
differences among countries may lead to differences in people’s propensity to report, for instance,
low levels or high levels of health. In addition, previous studies have shown that some individuals
tend to change their responses among multiple questions about self-assessed health, depending on
how and when in the questionnaire the questions are asked. (Crossley and Kennedy, 2002).

of the European version were: ”very good”, ”good”, “fair”, ”bad” or ”very bad”;
while the American-version alternatives were: ”excellent”, ”very good”, “good
health”, ”fair”, and ”poor”.

[Table 3 about here]
Table 3 presents statistics on voluntary health-insurance coverage by health
status, using both the European and the American scale. The medium level of
self-assessed health served as reference group both in the “European” version
(”fair health”) and in the “American” one (”good health”).
Observable health conditions and behavioral risk factors
The health and behavioral risk-related variables included specific dummies for a
number of conditions: cancer, heart problems, diabetes, asthma, high blood
pressure, and chronic lung diseases. We also included a variable for the
respondent’s total number of chronic symptoms. In the English version of the
questionnaire, the question about chronic conditions was formulated: ”Has a
doctor ever told you that you had any of the conditions on this card?” The
respondent could then answer yes to any of the symptoms.
This group of variables also included a set of dummies for risk-related behavior;
smoking, alcohol consumption (more than five times per week), and exercise
(simply whether the respondent performed any form of physical activity at least
once per week). The corresponding control groups were the people who did not
smoke, did not consume alcohol, and did not exercise. Finally, we also included a
dummy-variable for depression. This variable was based on a subjective measure;
it assumes the value of one, if the respondent answered yes to the question
whether he or she had been feeling depressed during the last month.

8

Demographics and country
The demographic control variables included age, education, gender, marital
status, employment status, and whether or not the respondent was born in the
country of residence. Furthermore, a series of dummy variables was used for
different wealth brackets. Wealth was defined as purchasing power parityadjusted household net wealth, and the dummy variables represented intervals
between 10th, 25th, 50th 75th and the 90th percentiles. The lowest wealth group
(i.e. the first decile) served as reference. We used imputed values constructed by
the SHARE team for observations with missing wealth values. 8
Our measure of education consisted of two dummy variables; one indicating
secondary education and the other higher-than-secondary education. Individuals
with less-than-secondary education served as the reference group.
Two dummy variables indicated unemployment and self-employment. We
expected unemployment to reduce the probability of insurance. Given that a
person who runs his own business may risk suffering losses if he or she gets sick,
we expected self-employment to have a positive effect.
Country-specific dummy variables were intended to capture effects of differences
in health-care or health-care-financing systems as well as in other unobservable
factors, such as culture and institutions. As a result of the relatively large number
of observations from Germany, we let the country serve as the reference group.
Health care systems in Europe are certainly rather different. Thus, in order to
further control for the effect of institutional difference and to perform some
robustness checks on our results, we used a number of interaction variables based
For documentation, see Börsch‐Supan and Jürges (2005). The percentage of imputed
wealth values for the participating countries (calculated from Börsch‐Supan and Jürges
2005) are as follows: Sweden, 6.8%; Denmark, 7.1%; Germany, 10.1%; The Netherlands,
7.7%; France, 10.9%; Switzerland, 10.4%; Austria, 7.5%; Italy, 7.7%; Spain, 10.7%; and
Greece, 6.5%.

on the country dummy variables. Each control variable in the “Health and Risk”
and “Demographics” groups of Table 2 was multiplied by each country dummy,
hence, creating the corresponding interaction variables for each country. In total,
we used approximately 250 control variables in the robustness check process.
3. Model specification and statistical method
The first step in our analysis consisted of investigating the correlation between
health risk and insurance. Thus, following the method of Ettner (1997) and
Doiron et al. (2008), we first estimated a specification that contained our healthrisk measures only (self-assessed-health dummies). Then we obtained the
subsequent specifications by adding group for group of explanatory variables to
the baseline specification. Since the dependent variable was dichotomous, we
used a probit-model to estimate each consecutive specification. The objective was
to see whether the relationship between risk and insurance disappeared, when
more explanatory variables were added.
Model (1) below represents the simplest specification. Throughout, pi is the
probability that individual i holds any VHI, and ε i is an error term. Ĥ i is a vector
of self-assessed health dummies (which may be of either the European or the
American formulation). In Model (2), we added the country-specific dummy
variables, contained in the vector Ĉ i . In the two subsequent models, a vector R̂i ,
representing health and behavioral risk- factors was added. Model 5 is the full
model with all control variables present.

(1)

pi = β1 Hˆ i + ε i

(2)

pi = β1 Hˆ i + β 2 Cˆ i + ε i

10

(3)

pi = β1 Hˆ i + β 2 Cˆ i + β 3 Dˆ i + ε i

(4)

pi = β 1 Hˆ i + β 2 Cˆ i + β 4 Rˆ i + ε i

(5)

pi = β1 Hˆ i + β 2 Cˆ i + β 3 Dˆ i + β 4 Rˆ i + ε i

As a second step, we compared the effect of observable health conditions on the
probability of insurance to the effect of the same variables on self-assessed health.
Thus, following a method similar the one of Lokshin and Ravallion (2005), we
first estimated an ordered probit-model with self-assessed health as dependent
variable. Model 6 below represents this specification, where hi is a discrete
variable that can assume four different values, each representing one of the health
levels. Thereafter, we estimated a probit-model with the same independent
variables but with insurance as dependent variable (Model 7).

(6)

hi = γ 1Cˆ i + γ 2 Dˆ i + γ 3 Rˆ i + η i

(7)

pi = γ 1Cˆ i + γ 2 Dˆ i + γ 3 Rˆ i + η i

4. Results
4.1. Voluntary health insurance and health-risk
Tables 4 and 5 show the main results in terms of estimated marginal effects from
the probit-regressions, utilizing the European and the American versions of the
11

self-assessed-health scale, respectively. Each coefficient denotes the effect on the
estimated likelihood that the respondent held voluntary health insurance of
moving from the baseline risk level, represented by “fair health” in the European
and “good health” in the American version, to the corresponding risk-levels. In
both cases, increased health-risk means a lower likelihood of holding voluntary
health insurance. Our result supports previous findings of a negative correlation
between health-risk and voluntary health insurance.
[Table 4 about here]
[Table 5 about here]
In the simplest specification (Model 1), only the variables for self-assessed health
(as indicators of risk: better health, lower risk) were included. The coefficients for
all variables except “excellent health” in the American version were significant at
the 1% or 10%-level. Moving from fair to very good self-assessed health in the
European version increased the probability of voluntary health insurance with
approximately 0.17. Note, however, that the effect was not monotonic. Moving
from good to very good health actually decreased the probability of voluntary
health insurance.

In Model 2, we added the set of country specific dummy-variables, controlling for
institutional differences between the European countries. All coefficients for selfassessed health had the expected signs and were significant at the 1% level. The
effects were monotonic. In the European version, moving from fair health to very
good health increased the likelihood of voluntary health insurance with 0.242.
Similarly, moving to the lowest level of self-assessed health (very bad health)
decreased the likelihood with 0.249. The corresponding numbers for the
American version were 0.158 and 0.288.

12

In Models 3, 4 and 5, we continued to add groups of control variables. In Model
3, we controlled for demographic effects, while model 4 included observable
health factors and risk behavior. Model 5 was the full model with all control
variables present. It is evident from tables 4 and 5 that the negative correlation
between risk and insurance certainly persisted. The marginal effects on the
probability of voluntary health insurance of moving from fair/good to the best
category of self-assessed health were, however, reduced to 0.095 and 0.081. Note,
though, that the effect of moving from good health to very good health in the
American version was not statistically significant.

4.2. Robustness checks
In order to test the robustness of our results, we estimated models 3, 4, and 5 with
an additional set of control variables, namely the country specific interaction
variables. The rationale was to examine whether the found relationship would
vanish once we took into account the additional effect of, for example, being
unemployed in a specific country. The results from these probit regressions are
shown in table 6 for the European version and table 7 for the American version.
Indeed, the positive correlation between self-assessed health and voluntary health
insurance holdings, or for that matter, the negative correlation between risk and
insurance, seemed to persist. As apparent from tables 6 and 7, the marginal effects
were generally reduced slightly, and the p-values were increased for some of the
self-reported health levels. Nonetheless, including the interaction variables did not
substantially alter the results.
Moreover, we estimated a series of models in which one or more country was
omitted. The reason for this was to examine whether results might be driven by a
particularly strong effect in a specific country. When doing this, the marginal
effects of moving from one self-assessed health level to another were reduced
slightly in some cases, but the overall relationship was intact. Finally, we note that
13

there were no particular differences with regards to which country that was
omitted.
[Table 6 about here]
[Table 7 about here]

4.3. Risk preference or screening?
If the positive correlation between self-assessed health and insurance was caused
by heterogeneous risk preferences—i.e. that healthy individuals also were more
risk-averse—then we would expect observable health conditions to increase the
probability of insurance but to decrease self-assessed health. The first two
columns of Table 8 show the results from the probit-regressions of Model 7 on the
European and the American SHARE versions of self-assessed health. The third
column shows the results from the ordered probit regression of Model 6, using
insurance as a dependent variable.
[Table 8 about here]
Among the observable health conditions, cancer heart problems, chronic lung
disease, and the number of chronic conditions all had statistically significant
negative effects on self-assessed health in the European version. In the American
version, diabetes also had a statistically significant negative effect (at the 10%level). The only observable health condition that actually turned out to have a
positive effect on self-assessed health was high blood pressure.
Cancer had a statistically significant positive effect on the probability of holding
insurance (p-value 0.063), while heart problems, diabetes, and chronic lung
disease decreased the probability. Smoking and drinking appeared to increase the
14

probability of holding insurance.

5. Concluding remarks
In this paper, we addressed the demand for voluntary health insurance in Europe.
In similarity to other studies (Ettner, 1997; Hurd and McGarry, 1997; Smith and
Kington, 1997; Perry and Rosen, 2004; Doiron et al., 2008), we found that
individuals with a lower risk (measured as better self-assessed health) were more
likely to have voluntary health insurance than relatively risky individuals. This is
not consistent with what we would expect from the theory of adverse selection. A
strand of research argues that such results are caused by unobservable factors,
such as personality and risk preference, and that these factors are negatively
correlated with self-assessed health. In contrast to some previous studies
(Finkelstein and McGarry, 2003; Doiron et al., 2008), we did not find clear
evidence of such a relationship.
The effects of observable health conditions on the probability of holding
insurance and on self-assessed health are crucial for sorting out whether the
correlation between health-risk and holding insurance was a result of risk
preference among insured individuals or screening on behalf of the insurer. Ettner
(1997), for instance, found mixed results with regards to individual conditions.
Doiron et al. (2008) suggested that individuals with more long-term conditions
were more likely to purchase insurance. In our study, high blood pressure actually
turned out to have a positive effect on self-assessed health; the variable might
capture some unobservable personal trait that tends to be correlated with high
blood pressure, though. Since the coefficients of all other included health
conditions had the expected signs, we believe that we could safely conclude that
observable health conditions had a negative effect on self-assessed health.
Current smoking has certainly been found to be associated with a lower rate of
15

health insurance (Ettner, 1997; Doiron et al., 2008), but individuals who have
been smoking in the past may not be either more or less prone to have
supplemental health insurance (Hurd and McGarry, 1997). In our study, smoking
(and drinking) appeared to increase the probability of holding insurance. Most
observable health conditions seemed to decrease the probability, though. Thus, we
did not find any evidence that unambiguously supports the hypothesis that
heterogeneous risk preferences are behind the observed negative correlation
between risk and insurance.
Obviously, there may be some other factor influencing both health and the
propensity to hold health insurance. The quest for such a factor, as well as the
analysis of the effect of the explanatory variables on the demand for health
insurance can be performed within an extended demand-for-health framework.
Firmly founded on neoclassical economic theory, the demand-for-health model
(Grossman, 1972a, b) remains the dominating theoretical model for analyzing the
demand for health (and health investments). Afundamental idea behind the model
is that the demand for medical care is derived from the more fundamental demand
for health. Likewise, in an extended demand-for-health framework, it seems
reasonable to think about the demand for health insurance not as a demand for
insurance per se, but as derived from the demand for health. However, no
extension of the demand-for-health model that incorporates the (derived) demand
for health insurance has been published, even though this originally deterministic
model has certainly been extended to include various types of uncertainty (see, for
instance, Chang, 1996; Liljas, 1998). It goes beyond the purpose of this paper to
develop a formal extension of Grossman’s model, which incorporates the demand
for health insurance. However, it is possible to use a somewhat heuristic
approach, applying the fundamentals of the demand-for-health model to the
demand for health insurance without a specific model-adaption to the insurance
problem.
Thus, as regards an alternative explanation for the observed positive correlations
16

between health and health insurance, the demand-for-health framework contains a
plausible candidate: time preferences. An individual who does not discount future
wellbeing at all, for instance, will demand more health than another individual
who discounts future wellbeing, ceteris paribus. Likewise, no discounting of
future wellbeing means that the expected payoff from holding health insurance
and, hence, the present value of health insurance, will be higher than when future
outcomes are discounted. Consequently, time preferences may be responsible for
the observed correlation between risk and insurance.
The effects of the three central explanatory variables of the Grossman model—
age, wage, and education—on the demand for health insurance can be inferred as
follows. First, as the individual gets older the likelihood of adverse health shocks
becomes higher and, hence, strengthens the incentive for holding health
insurance; Second, a higher wage rate means that the present value of health
insurance increases, since the potential losses of income are larger when the wage
rate is higher; Third, more education means enhanced labor-market opportunities
and, hence, an individual who has a university degree will put a higher value on
health insurance than a comparable individual with less education.
Education, being female, being married, and being self-employed, all increased
the probability of holding insurance, while being foreign born decreased the
probability. Non-significant negative coefficients were found for age and being
unemployed. With a couple of exceptions, the results are in line with previous
research (Ettner, 1997; Hurd and McGarry, 1997; Smith and Kington, 1997; Perry
and Rosen, 2004; and Doiron et al., 2008). First, a common finding of previous
research is that people who have voluntary health insurance tend to be younger
than those who do not (Ettner, 1997; Doiron et al., 2008); we could not identify a
significant effect of age. Second, whereas our study showed the expected positive
sign for self-employment, Perry and Rosen (2004) found that self-employment
reduced the probability of having health insurance in the U.S. Given the “more to
lose” rationale, this might seem surprising, but their results should obviously be
17

seen in the light of the fact that American health insurance generally is tied to
employment. We found no statistically significant effect of wealth, whereas a
positive correlation between wealth (or income) and insurance was found in
several previous studies (Ettner, 1997; Hurd and McGarry, 1997; Smith and
Kington, 1997; Perry and Rosen, 2004; and Doiron et al., 2008).
Health insurance provides the text-book example of a market with adverse
selection. Yet, there is little or no evidence in practice that adverse selection is or
must be an important problem in health insurance. Health-insurance markets seem
to be stable, despite the prediction of the Rotschild-Stiglitz model either that an
equilibrium would not exist or that the equilibrium would be characterized by
high health-risks buying full insurance and low risks buying incomplete coverage.
It is difficult, however, to define a strong test for the presence of adverse selection
in health insurance (Pauly, 1986). We did not find any support in our study—on
the contrary. In line with previous studies, we found a negative correlation
between health-risk and health insurance. The explanation did not appear to be
heterogeneous risk-preferences of the insured but more likely that insurers were
able to offer more attractive contracts to low-risk individuals, by discriminating
on the basis of observable characteristics.
