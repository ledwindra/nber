    "abstract": "\n\nSolar power is now economically competitive with fossil fuels in many countries, yet relatively few homeowners have installed solar panels on their property.  A principal reason for this behavior stems from cognitive biases\u2014such as myopia, inertia and herding\u2014that cause consumers to avoid investing in long-term measures, even those that are financially attractive to them and produce social benefits such as reducing the long-term consequences of climate change.  A behavioral risk audit can demonstrate ways to address these cognitive biases, in concert with short-term economic incentives and social influences.  We focus on the installation of solar panels, an issue that has relevance to residents in the United States and the European Union, and to property owned by businesses and governments.\n\n",
