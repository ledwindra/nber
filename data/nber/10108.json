This paper investigates the role of markets for Americas State bonds in  Britain and the U.S. during and between the crises in 1837, 1839, and 1842. There is strong evidence that the crises in 1839 and 1842 originated in the U.S. and spread to Britain. There is also strong evidence that credit markets for American state bonds were tighter in the U.S. than in London between 1839 and 1842.\n\n",
