ABSTRACT
This paper investigates whether the quantity theory of money is still alive. We demonstrate three insights.
First, for countries with low inflation, the raw relationship between average inflation and the growth
rate of money is tenuous at best. Second, the fit markedly improves, when correcting for variation
in output growth and the opportunity cost of money, using elasticities implied by theories of Baumol-Tobin
and Miller-Orr. Finally, the sample after 1990 shows considerably less inflation variability, worsening
the fit of a one-for-one relationship between money growth and inflation, and generates a fairly low
elasticity of money demand.

Introduction

One of the most established folk wisdoms in monetary economics is a relationship,
which, in its practical version for monetary policy might be stated as follows: long
run inflation is related one-for-one with long-run monetary growth. This “quantity
theory” relationship seems firmly established at least since Friedman (1956) and Lucas
(1980).
This paper takes a cross-section of countries from 1970 to 2005, see appendix A,
and re-investigates the relationship between monetary growth and inflation. We
demonstrate three insights. First, for countries with low inflation, the raw relationship between average inflation and the growth rate of money is tenuous at best.
Second, the fit markedly improves, when correcting for variation in output growth
and the opportunity cost of money, using elasticities implied by theories of BaumolTobin and Miller-Orr. Finally, the sample after 1990 shows considerably less inflation
variability, worsening the fit of a one-for-one relationship between money growth and
inflation, and generates a fairly low elasticity of money demand.
To demonstrate these insights, we provide a series of graphs and tables. For
countries with moderate inflation, we show that the raw relationship between money
growth and inflation is tenuous at best or even nonexistent. Quantity theory suggest
to take into account the growth rate of real GDP. Additionally, monetary theory has
pointed out the dependence of velocity on yields. The correction for GDP growth
alone turns out not to help. However, the correction for a yield effect has a remarkable
impact. Indeed, one would expect a rise in nominal yields to increase the opportunity
costs of holding money, and thus to lead to reductions in the real quantity of money
per real unit of output: ceteris paribus, this should then lead to additional inflation.
Lucas (2000) has documented a rather tight fit of the ratio of the real quantity of
money to real output vis-a-vis the yield on government bonds, which furthermore is
close to a relationship predicted by theories on the transaction demand for money,
see Baumol (1952), Tobin (1956), Miller and Orr (1966). Taking into account the
relationship suggested by Lucas, we demonstrate that the fit indeed markedly improves. A similarly good fit is obtained, when using the elasticity values suggested
by Miller and Orr (1966). We finally estimate the relationship and find just a small
improvement over the theoretical specifications.
The estimation of money demand equations has been under quite some debate in
the 90s. It has been a testing decade for these equations, see in particular the debate
in e.g. Ball (2001), Carlson et al (2000), Coenen and Vega (2001), and Teles and
1

Zhou (2005), Ireland (2009), Sargent and Surico (2011), Lucas and Nicolini (2013).
We therefore split our data into two parts. For the first part, we use data from 1970
to 1990, whereas we use data from 1990 to 2005 for the second part. The breaking
point in 1990 is chosen to reflect changes in monetary regimes and regulation, but is
perhaps somewhat arbitrary. Teles and Zhou (2005) and Lucas and Nicolini (2013),
consider 1980 as the data break for the US, focusing on the effects on monetary aggregates of banking deregulation introduced after 1980.1 Those changes together with
the financial innovation in the 1990s associated with the development of electronic
payments suggest that M1 might not be the most appropriate monetary aggregate
to use in the second part of the sample. Another justification for a data break, more
in line with the work of Sargent and Surico (2011), is the generalized use of some
form of inflation targeting around a low target. A natural data break there is 1990,
which dates the explicit use of inflation targeting by different countries around the
world (New Zealand first introduced it in 1991) and the convergence to low inflation
in most developed countries.
We show that the relationship between money growth and inflation has become
much looser during this second part of the sample. Generalized inflation targeting
at low inflation rates makes it harder to establish a one-for-one relationship between
average inflation and the growth rate of money, as also argued by Sargent and Surico
(2011) using US time series data. But variation across countries in average growth
of money is still hard to explain. Possibly higher dispersion in regulation or financial
innovation may account for part of it.
We also document, using the cross section of countries, the reduction in the interest
elasticity of the money demand for the more recent data that has been observed in
the time series for different countries, as in e.g. Ireland (2009). This also means that
the apparent coincidence between the estimated relationship and the theory-implied
elasticities for the whole sample is somewhat illusory, as the overall sample estimated
elasticity happens to be an average of a high elasticity for the first part of the sample
and a low elasticity for the second part of the sample.
Investigating international cross-sections of countries to analyze the evidence on
the quantity theory of money has obviously been done before, notably by Candless
and Weber (1995), restated in Lucas (1996), and Duck (1993). We build up on this
literature. More recent literature such as Assenmacher-Wesche and Gerlach (2006),

Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982.

using information on the interest rate, and Benati (2009) find a long run unit relationship between money growth and inflation for several countries, but do not exploit
the cross section evidence as we do.
The outline of the paper is as follows. We largely proceed by showing pictures.
Section 2 provides a basic perspective on the cross-country data. Section 3 provides
a model and a more sophisticated analysis, introducing technological progress in production and the transactions technology, and allowing for additional “corrective”
terms. Section 4 examines the issue of subsample instability. The data is described
in section A. An online appendix and a .zip file provide further graphs and tables, as
well as the data used and the programs for calculating all results.
We conclude that quantity theory is still alive. Whether it should be used as
a guide to long-term monetary policy is more debatable, and it is certainly beyond
the scope of this paper. As argued by Woodford (2008), there is no independent
role for tracking the growth rate of money, if a central bank is already willing and
able to stabilize inflation rates at short and medium-term horizons, without making
an explicit use of monetary aggregates. The practice of central banks seems to be
reassuring, that it is possible to keep inflation low using, as it appears to be the case,
some form of interest rate feedback rule. However, theory is more sceptical about that
capacity, pointing out that local determinacy does not imply uniqueness (see e. g.
Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2001). The tracking of money supply could be
a means of avoiding some of that multiplicity (see Atkeson, Chari and Kehoe, 2010,
as well as the analysis in Fischer et al, 2006).

The World

Teachers of intermediate macroeconomics may have consulted Barro (1993 or 2007) in
order to teach students the relationship between monetary growth rates and inflation.
His figure 7.1 in the 1993 edition shows a large sample of countries, and plots this
relationship, having calculated the growth rates of money and prices from, typically,
the fifties to 1990. The figure is reproduced here as figure 1: one apparently gets a
nice fit to the 45 degree line.
However, that picture turns out to be misleading and mainly driven by high
inflation countries. Concentrating on the subset of countries, whose inflation rate
was below 12 percent, the points no longer assemble nicely around a line, but rather
produce a rather randomly looking scatter plot, see figure 2. The question is thus:

growth rates and inflation in a sample of 79 countries. The data is from Barro (1993).
Also drawn is the 45 degree line: it seems, that indeed long-term monetary growth is
synonymous with long-term inflation.

Figure 2: This figure is the same as figure 1, but restricting attention to only those
countries, whose inflation rate was below 12 percent. Instead of a tight relationship
between monetary growth and inflation, one can just see a cloud.

5

is the relationship between monetary growth and inflation too loose to be of any
relevance for low inflation countries?
These pictures should be considered disturbing by anybody who believes in a
tight relationship between monetary growth and inflation and bases monetary policy
advice on such a belief. Additional issues may be of relevance at low rates of inflation,
however. In particular, GDP growth, changes in interest rates, technological progress
in transaction technologies as well as production may make a difference. Some theory
is needed to sort out the issues.

3

Money demand and technological progress

In deriving an equilibrium money demand relationship, a tricky issue to deal with is
technical progress in both production of final goods as well as production of transaction services. We consider a very simple monetary model similar to the one in Lucas
(2000) with labor only, a transactions technology, and exogenous technical progress
in both production and transactions. Suppose, that each unit of labor produces Ap,t
units of the final good in goods production and that As,t measures progress in the
transactions technology. We assume the (representative) agent needs transaction services proportional to real consumption ct , which are produced with labor time on
transaction services st and real money balances mt = Mt /Pt ,
ct = As,tf (st , mt )
Under mild conditions, this can be rewritten as
st = l(A−1
s,t ct , mt ).

(1)

Equating labor productivity to wages, a generic maximization of a consumer would
read

Pt ct + Mt+1 + Bt+1 ≤ Mt + (1 + it )Bt + Pt Ap,t (1 − ht − st ) − Tt , t ≥ 0

together with a no-Ponzi games condition, where Bt are nominal bonds, collecting a
nominal interest rate it , and ht is leisure with total time endowment of unity, and
6

where we assume that preferences U(ct , ht ) are consistent with balanced growth. Tt
are lump sum taxes.
We assume that the function l is of the form
l(c, m) = ηca mb

(2)

for some η, a and b, where we assume that b < 0 and η > 0.
When a = 1 and b = −1, the form for the transactions technology can be justified
by assuming, inspired by Baumol (1952) and Tobin (1956), that the consumer spends
cash holdings intended for the purchase of the good at a constant rate ct per unit
of time. mctt is the number of times cash balances for transactions of the good are
exhausted and must be restored, the number of trips to the bank. This time
cost is
 2
c
a constant η. The Miller-Orr (1966) specification amounts to l(c, m) = η m , i.e.
a = 2 and b = −2.
The first order conditions imply
−Ap,t lm (A−1
s,t ct , mt ) = it

(3)

or
At cat mb−1
= it
t
where
At = −ηbAp,t A−a
s,t > 0
In logs, and equating consumption to output, ct = yt = Ap,t (1 − ht − st ), we get
m1−b
t
log
yta

!

= log At − log it

(4)

Taking the first difference between two consecutive years, (4) implies
0 = (1 − b)∆ log mt + ∆ log it − a∆ log yt − ∆ log At

(5)

To make contact with the data, we wish to examine a panel of countries j = 1, . . . , J
and a period t = 0, . . . , T . Summing from some initial year 0 to some terminal year
T , and dividing by the length of time T , one gets a relationship between the growth
rates over that time period. For a country j and a variable xj,t , generally denote this
sample growth rate with
log xj,T − log x0,T
(6)
ẋj =
T
7

Equation (5) can then be rewritten as
ṁj = −

ẏj +

(7)

where we have disentangled At again into its two components. While, given a particular sample, equation (7) is correct as a statement of the relationship between the
changes or growth rates of variables, stationarity of it may induce that term to be
quantitatively small. Whether this is so is an empirical issue, and one answered by
our figures: it turns out that this term can make quite a difference indeed.
The link between production and labor productivity is useful for providing further
insight. If production labor stays constant, then
ċj = ẏj = Ȧp,j

(8)

Note that Ap,t essentially reflects the opportunity cost for time to be used in the
transaction technology versus the production technology, and equals the real spot
wage wp,t . More generally (and beyond the model at hand), it is the equality between
the growth of that opportunity cost or the real spot wage and the growth rate of
output that is needed. We are considering off-balanced-growth equilibria, however:
note e.g. the potential change in nominal interest rates. Therefore, the theory would
typically not imply constancy of labor in production or equality of growth rates
between wages and output. Empirically, there surely is always some discrepancy
between these two growth rates, and it is due to a variety of factors. The longrun shift between production labor and transaction time surely is a rather minor
driving force here, though. Therefore, for the purpose of the exercise at hand, we feel
comfortable employing (8) for the empirical application, even off the balanced growth
path.
Balanced growth Along a balanced growth path the nominal interest rate
would be constant, i̇j = 0. Equation (7) and (8) would imply
(1 − b)ṁj = (1 + a)ẏj − aȦs,j .

(9)

On the other hand, (1) and (2) together with the balanced growth condition st ≡ s
implies
bṁj = aȦs,j − aẏj
(10)
These two equations together now imply the following result:
8

Theorem 1 To be consistent with balanced growth, the rate of technological progress
in the transaction technology must satisfy
Ȧs =

a+b
Ȧp
a

(11)

In particular, in the case of a + b = 0 (e.g. Baumol-Tobin, Miller-Orr),
Ȧs = 0

(12)

In other words, and for the Baumol-Tobin as well as the Miller-Orr specification,
the theory above implies that there cannot be technological progress in the transactions technology in the long run along the balanced growth path. Also note, that as
consequence of (11), we have
ṁ = ẏ.
(13)
Off the balanced growth path For our exercise, the growth rates are “in sample” and not long run. Indeed, in the sample, there may have been a permanent levelshift in the transaction technology parameter that may differ across countries, which
would be incompatible with balanced growth under the Baumol-Tobin or Miller-Orr
specifications. We still assume that ẏj = Ȧp,j , but do not impose that i̇j = 0 and
Ȧp,j , which would be needed for balanced growth.
Ȧs,j = a+b
a
It may be hard to measure As,t directly. For example, one could consider to
follow the detailed analysis in Attanasio, Guiso and Jappelli (2002). Instead, we shall
proceed by assuming that the cross-country level shift can be captured by a random
fixed effect,
a
Ȧs,j = j ,
(14)
1−b
where we assume, and this is a strong assumption, that j is independent of ẏj and i̇j .
With this assumption as well as with (8), we finally obtain the empirical specification
ṁj = γ ẏj − αi̇j − j ,

(15)

which we shall estimate with ordinary least squares, where
γ=

1
1+a
,α=

Equivalently,
Ṁj − Ṗj =

1+a

i̇j − j .

Note that Ṗj is essentially the in-sample inflation rate,
πj =

T
Pt − Pt−1
1X
T t=1 Pt−1

(18)

of country j: we therefore call Ṗj “inflation” in our figures.
One can now either proceed to estimate (15), noting that the two structural parameters a and b are identified per (16), or one can directly measure the fit of that
equation for given specifications of the transaction technology. In particular, we note
that
1
(19)
Ṁj − Ṗj = ẏj − i̇j − j
2
for the Baumol-Tobin specification and
1
Ṁj − Ṗj = ẏj − i̇j − j
3

(20)

for the Miller-Orr specification.
As a final note and as a consequence of Theorem 1, note that the Baumol-Tobin
specification , with a = 1 and b = −1, would have implied
1

Ṁj − Ṗj = − i̇j + ẏj + Ȧp,j − Ȧs,j

(21)

i.e., involve a coefficient of 0.5 on ẏj . This would be in contrast to typical formulations
of the quantity theory. In particular, Lucas (2000) proposes to use the relationship
Mt
log
Pt Ytγ

!

= const − α log it

(22)

with γ = 1 and α = 0.5. While this parameter choice would appear to be inconsistent
with (21), it actually is consistent with equation (19), thereby resolving this apparent
paradox. It is because ẏj = Ȧp,j under balanced growth that the income elasticity
is one rather than one half. The unit elasticity of the money demand to output is a
feature of long run growth.
Our specification in (15) like the specification in (22) is “log-log” in contrast to
some semi-log specifications, see the discussion in Bailey (1956). This difference in
specifications has implications for calculating the welfare costs of inflation (see also
Correia and Teles (1999), Dutta and Kapur (1998), Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1992,
1998)). We follow Lucas (2000), because the log-log specification is implied by our
theoretical derivation above and because the fit of the semi-log is only negligibly
better than the log-log. Details are available in the online appendix.

Data and Results

For our investigation, we have chosen 1970, 1990 and 2005 for all OECD countries,
drawing on statistics of the IMF as well as the OECD and other sources. We excluded
countries with average inflation above 12 percent, transition countries and countries
with missing data. The reason not to include data after 2005 is not to include the zero
bound episode in the aftermath of the financial crisis. At zero interest rates, money
and bonds are perfect substitutes and the demand for money is not uniquely pinned
down. Put differently, if we are to find changes in the relationship between money
growth and inflation after 1990, they will not be due to zero bound considerations.
We used short rates as well as M1 for all countries. We also experimented with
M2 and M3, as well as long rates: the data problems there were generally greater,
but preliminary results looked rather similar to the results documented here. More
information on the data as well as explanations for the short codes used to denote
countries are in appendix A.
Since both the selection of countries as well as the sample differs from those in
the previous figures, figure 3 shows a version of figure 2 for this updated data set.
Figure 4 “corrects” the money growth rate by subtracting the GDP growth rate. The
points scatter loosely below the 45-degree line. Figure 5 removes the yield effect with
the coefficient of 0.5 on the interest rate change as suggested by the Baumol-Tobin
specification (19), as well as suggested by Lucas (2000). The correction with the
yield considerably improves the fit, shifting the data points upwards, that now line
up nicely along the 45-degree line. Information about the quality of fit, by calculating
the variances of i is in table 1, including results for subsamples, see section 4.
Figure 6 contains the result for the Miller-Orr specification, while Figure 7 finally
contains the result of estimating (15) per ordinary least squares. The results from
this regression are in table 2, including results for subsamples, see section 4. The
estimated coefficients are between the Baumol-Tobin and Miller-Orr values. For the
whole sample, all three specifications provide essentially the same quality of fit. We
have also calculated the regression results, imposing γ = 1, as is implied by our two
benchmark transaction technology specifications: the results are in table 2.

Subsamples
Loss of money demand stability in the 90s...

We now draw attention to the results for the second subsample, for the data after
1990. While the fit for all specifications in the first half of the sample is essentially
as good as for the whole sample, the fit becomes worse for the second half of the
sample, as table tab:reg shows. The Miller-Orr specification as well as the estimated
specification now fit clearly better than the Baumol-Tobin specification.
The figures provide an even more revealing story. Figure 8 shows the results for
the Miller-Orr specification for the first part of the sample, and figures 9 and 10 show
the results, respectively for Miller-Orr and the estimated coefficients, for the second

Miller-Orr specification for the first part of the sample, which is 1970-1990. All three
money demand specifications (Baumol-Tobin, Miller-Orr, estimated) yield rather similar figures, which in turn are rather similar to the full-sample figure.
subsample.
We want to stress three points here. The first is that the estimated interest
elasticity is considerably lower for the second part of the sample. This result that we
obtain in the cross section has been observed in the literature on the stability of the
money demand using time series data, as for example in Ireland (2009). Part of the
explanation for the low elasticity is the increasing role of money substitutes that are
not included in M1, as argued by Teles and Zhou (2005) and, recently also by Lucas
and Nicolini (2013).
The second result is the poor fit of a money demand relationship in the second part
of the sample. The data shows a high variability of both the inflation-money-growth
difference as well as the log-interest-rate regressor in that subsample compared to the
full sample.
The third result is that inflation is nearly the same across the countries, despite

specification: the data clusters around a flat ”inflation-target” line.

variability in (corrected) money growth rates. Put differently, there is no visible oneto-one relationship between inflation and monetary growth for the second part of the
sample. Examining figures 9 and 10 makes this point in a striking way. Our explanation is as follows. Central banks have increasingly focused on achieving a particular
target inflation rate. Apparently, they are successful in achieving this goal. Central
banks choose a monetary growth rate that offsets shocks to the money-inflation relationship, in order to achieve their common target. There is considerable residual
dispersion in money growth, probably due to differing experiences in deregulation
and innovation in transactions technologies.
Interestingly, the recent work of Sargent and Surico (2011) makes a similar point
using the time series evidence for the US, as in Lucas (1988). They also argue that
part of difficulty in establishing a relationship between money and prices in the US
in the more recent data is due to the policy of inflation targeting. This has reduced
the intertemporal variability of inflation, making it harder to find a one-for-one low
frequency relationship between money and prices in the US time series.

Conclusions

A cross section of long term averages for inflation and money growth plotted one
against the other as in e. g. Mc Candless and Weber (1995) has those averages line
up nicely along a 45 degree line. In his Nobel lecture Lucas (1996) claims that there
is no sharper evidence in monetary economics.2 But the evidence is by no means as
sharp when the sample excludes countres with very high inflation. For countries with
moderate inflation, the overwhelming evidence is just not there.
We use a cross section of countries with moderate inflation to reestablish the
one-to-one close relationship between long term inflation and money growth. For
that we need to take into account the effect of long term movements in nominal
interest rates, according to elasticities that match the ones suggested by both theory
on transactions technology, as in Baumol (1952), Tobin (1956), Miller-Orr (1966),
and estimation using time series data for the US and other countries, as in Lucas
(1980, 2000), Ireland (2009), Lucas and Nicolini (2013). Once we take into account
2

”(...)Central bankers and even some monetary economists talk knowledgeably of using high interest rates to control inflation, but I know of no evidence from even one economy linking these
variables in a useful way, let alone evidence as sharp as that displayed in figure 1. The kind of monetary neutrality shown in this figure needs to be a central feature of any monetary or macroeconomic
theory that claims empirical seriousness.(...)”

the effect of movements in interest rates according to the Baumol-Tobin or MillerOrr elasticities for the whole sample, between 1970 and 2005, what appeared to be a
random scatter of points is now a 45 degree line through the origin.3
The data is split into two subsamples with the data break in 1990. The date is
chosen to approximately date the generalized convergence to low inflation, as well as
changes in regulation of financial institutions and financial inovation. We find that for
this later part of the sample the fit is worse, possibly because of greater dispersion in
deregulation and technology adoption, and the interest elasticity is lower. Neither of
these results is surprising. What is somewhat surprising is that the interest elasticity
in the cross section is so close to the elasticities found by others using the time series
for the US, as in e. g. Ireland (2009) or Lucas and Nicolini (2013).
One interesting feature of the data in the later sample is that the variability of
inflation is considerably reduced. The points seem to form an horizontal line at low
inflation. With low variability of inflation it is not easy to find a one to one relationship
between inflation and money growth. This same difficulty was met by Sargent and
Surico (2009) in their review of Lucas (1980). They also find that inflation targeting
around low inflation, reducing its variability, made it hard to extract from the more
recent US data the one-to-one relationship that Lucas (1980) found. Our results here
complement their findings, using a cross-country analysis compared to their US time
series analysis.

Data Description

The countries included in the regressions starts from the list of OECD countries,
excluding Chile, Israel, Mexico and Turkey, due to high inflation during relevant parts
of the sample. We furthermore excluded Luxembourg (as it is a financial hub in small
country) and the transition countries (since there is no useful data for the purpose
of the analysis here from 1970 and 1990). For all other countries, we attempted to
obtain as much reliable data as possible, dropping Belgium, Greece, and Sweden due
to missing data. In the end, 20 countries remain in the sample for at least part of
the calculations. Table 3 lists the country codes used and table 4 lists the values of
the data, with modest precision. An Excel file containing all the data as well detailed
remarks regarding sources and corrections is available as part of an online appendix
to the paper. Likewise, the MATLAB programs that perform all the calculations and
produce the graphs as part of an online appendix to the paper.
An original version of the data used was collected by Jan Auerbach, an undergraduate RA in Berlin 2006, using EcoWin, a commercial data base, which was available
and existence then. The EcoWin data in turn was mostly based on data available
from the International Financial Statistics of the IMF, thus providing reasonable
comparability across countries. Ding Xuan, an undergraduate RA in Chicago 2012,
corrected a few entries, using IMF and World Bank Data. A number of further issues
then were dealt with by the authors. Euro zone countries do not have an independent series for M1, but data for their contribution to M1 can be found, often per
tradingeconomics.com . For Germany, the M1 as well as the real GDP series was
”spliced” across unification, per setting 1990 = 100 for real GDP, and relating 1970
to 1990 in West Germany as well as 2005 to 1990 (real GDP: 1991, set at 102) for
all of Germany. Interest rate data and money supply data for 1970 and several individual countries was obtained on a case-by-case basis, typically per data provided by
their central banks or the national statistical office. Since the paper at hand focusses
on prices, M1, real GDP and short-term interest rates, the data regarding M2, M3
and long-term rates would need further corrections before full use, but appears to be
sufficient to provide a “first pass” at the results.
