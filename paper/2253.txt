Implicit Estimates of Natural, Trend,
and Cyclical Components of Real GNP

ABSTRACT

Estimates of the natural or full employment level of real
GNP have usually been obtained by statistical detrending

procedures which assume independence between trend and
cycle.

This paper presents an alternative approach which

says that the natural level should be measured in the
context of a macro model.
If the quantity equation holds
with money exogenous and if the price level is sticky, then
observed real GNP will reflect both nominal shocks, which
are observed, and real shocks, which are unobserved shifts
in the natural level. The path of the natural level is then
implicit in the data given the model. Calculated paths of

the natural level of U.S. real GNP and the resulting
business cycle are presented.

Introduction

A series of recent papers has renewed interest in an
old problem in economic measurement: how should we decompose

aggregate output into its "natural" or "full employment"
level and the "business cycle" which is the deviation of
actual output from the natural level? One motivation for
asking the question is that we claim to have some theories
of the business cycle which may suggest policies that could

be taken to reduce them.

Another motivation is that we

would like to test these theories and we need to identify

the two components empirically in order to do so.

The

traditional solution to the problem has been to assume that

the natural level follows an exponential function with a
constant growth rate so the cyclical component is revealed
as the residuals in the regression of the log of output on

time. The idea, apparently, is that long term growth must
be due to growth in the natural level and since regression
on time removes growth from the data it corresponds to the
decomposition we seek.

While the first part is true by

assumption, the second need not follow.

The natural level

may be subject to transitory disturbances, for example
weather, which would then be included in the business cycle.

More fundamentally, the natural level may itself be a
stochastic process which grows because it is nonstationary

rather than because it depends deterministically on time.

In an earlier paper, Charles I. Plosser and I pointed out

3

that the presence of a deterministic time trend is a
testable hypothesis which enjoys little support from the
data.

If the deterministic trend hypothesis is wrong, then

regression detrending will confound business cycle movements
with stochastic variation in the natural level.

Harvey (1985) has suggested that the decomposition
problem be cast in the state space framework with output
consisting of a stationary cycle plus a drifting random walk

which accounts for long term growth. The two components are
assumed to be statistically independent in order to identify

the state space model.

The Kalman filter is used to

calculate estimates of the random walk and cycle components.

Watson (1986) and Clark (1986) have applied the state space

model to post-war U.S. quarterly data.

An alternative

univariate (using only data on the variable itself)
detrending method is that suggested by Stephen Beveridge and

myself (1981) in which the trend is defined as the long

range forecast obtained from an ARIMA model.

inappropriate, then resulting estimates of trend and cycle
will not correspond to the natural level and the deviations

from it that we would like to measure.

Sir John Hicks

(1965) made the point very clearly when he wrote:

manner, a corresponding arrangement of theory will

no reason to suppose that there is anything
corresponding to it on the economic side which is
at all fundamental, We have no right to conclude,
from the mere existence of the statistical device,
that the economic forces making for trend and for
fluctuation are any different, so that they have
to be analyzed in different ways."
The approa.ch to measurement of the natural and cyclical

components proposed in this paper departs from past efforts

in two fundamental respects.

First, it abandons the

assumption of independence between trend and cycle, allowing

instead for interaction between them.

Second, it is based

on a model of fluctuations in output where nominal and real

shocks both play a role.

As a starting point I take for

granted that actual output at time t, say Qt in logs, is a

function of the sequence of nominal shocks as well as the

path of the natural level of output.

The latter may be

thought of as indexing the production possibilities frontier

facing the economy and reflects the growth of the stocks of

capital, labor and technology as well as real shocks which

5

may be in part transitory (the weather) and in part
permanent. In general there is a relation of the form

t = Q(..Xt-i,

(1)

.,QNt_l,QNt)

where Y is a vector of nominal variables and QN denotes the
natural level of output.

The general strategy proposed in this paper is to use
the relationship between observed Q and observed

the unobserved value of QN.

to infer

To make this operational of

course we need a particular model which specifies the
relevant variables.

The identifying restriction in this

approach is independence between observed variables (which

might potentially include some components of QN) and the

A

unobserved components of QN which we wish to infer.

simplifying assumption I make in this paper is that nominal

shocks are summarized by nominal GNP, denoted Y, as in the

empirical models used by Lucas (1973) and Gordon (1982) so
that equation (1) becomes

(2)

Qt =Q(..,Yt_i,Yt;..,QNt_i,QNt).

The role of equation (2) then is to divide a given exogenous
change in nominal spend'ing between changes in output and the

price level since the three are linked by the identity Y =
+

P,

where P is the log of the price deflator.

Q

This

recursive structure relating income to output and prices is

a characteristic of monetary models in which exogenous

6

movements in monetary aggregates determine nominal income

through a money demand function.

Some evidence that

quarterly GNP data are not seriously at odds with the
recursive structure assumption is presented in an earlier
paper (Nelson, 1979), and Fama (1981) has demonstrated its
consistency with the aversion that the stock market shows to
inflation.

Lagged adjustment of output and prices to a

nominal shock is a property of both sticky price models and

models in which prices are flexible but information
available to individual agents is incomplete. Stickiness in
prices has been a mainstay of macroeconomic theory at least

since Hume (1752) and recently has gotten a more rigorous
foundation in the literature based on contracting theory.
Section 2 of the paper investigates a simple dynamic model

suggested by partial adjustment of prices, Section 3
presents the implied natural and trend components of real

GNP, Section 4 studies the resulting cyclical component,
Section 5 compares these results with alternative methods,

and Section 6 offers some conclusions and suggestions for
further research.
2.

An Empirical Price Adjustment Model
To implement equation (2) empirically I investigate the

distributed lag function relating real GNP to nominal GNP
using post-war quarterly U.S. data (1947:1 -

1985:4).

The

history of the natural level of real GNP is implicit in the

residuals of this model. Since all of these variables are

7

nonstationary I work with first differences denoted by lower

case letters.

My expectation was that the long run

multiplier in this relationship would be close to zero since
an exogenous increase in the growth rate of nominal spending

should have little, if any, permanent impact on the growth
rate of real GNP or, equivalently, nominal shocks should be

ultimately absorbed in the price level.

My prior work on

the dynamics of inflation for the 1954-1970 period (Nelson,
1979) suggests that the distributed lag will be a simple one

with geometric decay of the lag coefficients.

I therefore

fitted the transfer function (distributed lag model)
L
(3)

+ C + et

qt =
1 -SL

which implies an impact multiplier of 0)0 and allows for
geometric decay at rate 3 after a second period effect of
(öO)oC01).

The long run multiplier effect of y on q (the

gain of the transfer function) is given by (0)0—0)1)1(1-3) so

I expected o and 0 to be approximately equal.

Least

square parameter estimates using the PDQ program TRAN/EST
yielded
.74 —

qt =

Yt

et;

R-sq = .76

which implies a small negative point estimate for the gain

and a rather slow rate of decay, both of which are
consistent with the results for 1954-1970 period I reported
earlier.

What is apparent, though, in this longer time

8

period is a persistence in residual autocorrelation which

starts at .44 at lag one and declines slowly, suggesting
that the residuals behave like an ARMA(1,l) in which case we

would have (1—L)et = (1—tL)ut where u denotes white noise.
Reestimating with that specification, I obtained

Remaining residual autocorrelation is not suggestive of a
more complex ARN scheme, nor do cross-correlations between

the residuals and the

independent variable

suggest

misspecification of the transfer function. While the point

estimate of the gain is negative (—0.04), it is not
significant (the difference between estimated °o and (O

being

a fraction of one standard error).

The two denominator parameters 8 and $ are both within

one standard error of 0.9, indeed the difference between
them is not significant. If we take 8 and $ to be the same
parameter we can multiply through by a common factor (1-pL),

where p is about 0.9, thereby putting it in ARMAX form.

which effectively gives the same fit to the data as did the
unconstrained transfer function.

It is readily shown that an equation of this form would

be implied by partial adjustment of the price level in
response to shifts in Y and QN.

If the price level were

completely flexible then actual Q would always be equal to

QN and the price level would be PNt t -

Qk

where PN may

be thought of as the natural level of the price index. If
the price level is not completely flexible but rather the

actual price level at time t depends also on past actual
price levels then the simplest specification is

Replacing P by its equivalent (Y-Q) and PN by (Y-QN), taking
first differences, and solving for qt we have
(8)

qt =

• qn

where qn denotes the first difference of the log of QN.
Equation (8) describes the lagged adjustment of output to
changes in nominal spending and the natural level of output.

In this heuristic model there is one parameter, 1, which
corresponds to parameters 8 and 0 of the empirical model
(5).

It also corresponds to the numerator parameters 0

which take on somewhat smaller values empirically than do
the denominator parameters. This difference, however, seems
to be related to sample period since if we drop the noisier

early years and estimate the model for 1954:1 - 1985:4 the

10

numerator parameter values jump to .84 while 6 and 4 remain
near .9.

A value of around .9 for

is roughly consistent

with the overlapping contracts interpretation of price level

adjustment if the U.S. economy is characterized by three
year contracts, one twelfth of which adjust each calendar

quarter. But there is no need to put too fine a point on
it.

The objective here

is

to obtain

a

simple

characterization of the dynamics of nominal and real GNP in

order to see what such a model would imply about the
behavior of the natural level component of real GNP.

The Implied Behavior of the Natural Rate of Output

The next step is to infer the behavior of the natural
level of output, QN, from the empirical model given by (5)
and (6) by interpreting its parameters in the context of the

partial adjustment model given by (8).

This representation of the natural rate is a first order
moving average process in first differences qn where the
innovations Ut' are the innovations in the transfer function

:scaled by the factor 11(1-A.)

The standard deviation

of qn (the quarterly growth in QN) is therefore about .05

compared with .01 for the sample standard deviation of
actual output growth q, where the scale of these numbers is

such that .10 would be 10% over a calendar quarter. But a

12

substantial portion of the variation in qn is transitory.

This is not the contradiction in terms that it may seem.
Note that the IMA(1,1) structure of QN is consistent with
its being composed of a random walk with drift, denoted QT,

with innovation v plus a transitory random part, denoted w
(for weather).

The first difference of QN then has the

representation qn = Vt + wt. The autocovariances of qn
give two equations in two unknowns:

var (qn) =

(12)

var

(v) + 2 var (w)

coy (qn, qn_1) =

- var

(w).

model implies that the innovations v in the

stochastic trend underlying the natural level QN are noisier

than observed output growth itself, but this of course
reflects the smoothing that is implied by the transfer
function for q. Rewriting the second term of the model with

qn replaced by Cv + w) we have

which says that only about 5 percent of the variance in v
shows up in the variance of q. Empirically, we can estimate

the history of QT from the history of QN by the usual
exponential smoothing formula

OTt = (1—e) QNt + S

(15)

QT_

where 8 is the moving average parameter in equation (11) and

the ON are understood to be the estimates given the model

and the data.

This corresponds to the Beveridge/Nelson

estimate of the trend component of QN because it is the long

range forecast.

Equivalently it is the one-sided Kalman

filter estimate of the trend component of QN.

Calculation of the natural and trend components is
straightforward given the data on q and y, residuals u, and
parameter values ?., 8, and c.

Figure 1 shows the implied

histories of ON and QT along with actual Q using values ). =

.9,

8 =

.5,

and c =

.009.

The time period of the figure is

1970 - 1985 because this allows greater resolution over an

interval of particular current interest, but recursive
calculation of the components was started in 1947. We see

that the major movements in ON and QT correspond to the

major oil shocks of 1974, 1980 and (in reverse) 1983.
Slowdowns in the growth of the natural rate are apparent in

1970-71, 1973, and in a more prolonged way following 1977.

In each case, periods of slow GNP growth ensued.

More

recently, since 1983, the growth of the natural rate has

14

been rapid, corresponding to more. rapid GNP growth and
diminishing inflation.

For the entire period 1947-1985 we have the picture
shown in Figure 2 where only the trend component is plotted
along with actual real GNP. The contrast between the stable

price era of the 1950's and the inflation era of the 1970's

and the transition in the late 1960's are clear.

Also

apparent from Figure 2 is that considerable variation in GNP

is not due to variation in the natural rate. In particular,

the prolonged gaps between the actual and natural levels of
GNP from 1951 to 1966 and from 1973 to 1983 stand out. Note

that the transfer function model is a way of dividing the
variance of GNP growth between the influence of QN and the
influence of nominal shocks as summarized by Y.

According

to equation (4), only about 25 percent of the variance of
growth in real GNP is due to variation in the natural rate.
4.

The Business Cycle

The deviation of actual GNP from its natural level
represents the influence of nominal shocks to the economy as

well, in general, as the transitory influence of real
shocks.

For want of a better term we will join tradition

and call this difference between Q and QN the "business
cycle" and denote it QC, although there is nothing about the

framework of the paper that suggests predictably periodic
fluctuations. From the definition of QC and the heuristic
model of equation (8) we have

15

(16)

QCt

Qt - QNt

(/1-L)

=

Yt +

(—I1-.L)

qn

which puts the same lag structure on both sources of
variation in Q, although with opposite signs. A positive
nominal shock raises GNP relative to the natural rate, while
a positive shock to the natural rate raises the natural rate

faster than it does output--thereby reducing the cyclical
component.

In this decomposition there is definitely

independence between the natural rate (or trend) process and
the cycle component. They are negatively related.

The stochastic characteristics of the cycle may be
derived from equation (16).

We start by noting that after

multiplying through by the term (1-A.L) the QC process has
the form
(17)

QCt =

? QC

+

?Yt

-

Aqn.

Thus QC is autoregressive with coefficient ., which suggests

strongly autocorrelated (persistent) behavior given values

of ? around .9.

The last two terms in y and qn can be

thought of as the moving average part of the QC process.
Recall that qn itself is MA(1) with a coefficient of about
0.5 (following the convention of negative signs in front of

MA coefficients). Univariate analysis of y (the quarterly
growth rate of nominal GNP) suggests that an AR(1) model is

more appropriate than an MA(1) model, but for exploratory
purposes let us approximate the former by the latter; noting

16

the coefficient value is about - .4 and denoting its
innovations by e we have roughly
(18)

QCt =

.9 QC_j + .9 (Ct +
—

=

.01;

.9

(Ut' —.5ut_i')

= .05

recalling that u' are the innovations of the QN process. We

see that the MA part of the QC process is the sum of two

MA(1)'s, one positively autocorrelated and the other
negatively.

The net result depends then on the relative

variances of e and u', and since that of u' is larger, the
MA part of QC will display negative autocorrelation.

The

univariate behavior of Q is then characterized as ARNA(1,l).
To show what this looks like, Figure 3 displays QC over

the 1947-1985 period. The long waves in the series reflect

the persistence of the effects of y and qn through the AR
part of the process, while the chop in the series reflects

the negatively autocorrelated MA part of the process.
Recall that the MA behavior of qn can be interpreted as
being due to the presence of random noise, "the weather,"

and that is what causes the chop we see in QC. Note that
the cycle component of GNP was generally negative until the

late 1960's, then persistently positive until the early
1980's, corresponding to the eras of low inflation, rising
inflation, and waning inflation in the U.S. economy.

17

To eliminate some of the noise in QC we can
alternatively measure the deviation of actual GNP from the

smoothed trend component, that is (Q-QT), since it is QN
that is noisy rather than Q.

The resulting smoothed cycle

is shown in Figure 4. While the historical patterns are of

course the same, we get a clearer picture of them. Major
dips in the series correspond to some extent to traditional
NBER business cycles.

In order to see how nominal and real shocks contributed
separately to this overall pattern, the two components of QC

from equation (16) are plotted in Figure 5.

Nominal

inflationary in the early 1970's and continued so until
1982. The real influence on the cycle was positive in the

late 1940's and negative during the Korean War period,
presumably reflecting the ending and later resumption of
wartime controls.

Large real shocks show up of course in

1974 and to a lesser extent in 1980. Recall that negative

real shocks will increase the cycle component.

Most

interestingly, perhaps, the real contribution to the cycle
has been strongly negative since 1982 suggesting that it is

this rather than monetary restraint that is largely the
source of diminished inflation.

Perhaps this is why the

monetarists have been consistently wrong in forecasting the

return of inflation in recent years.

18

In effect they were

only looking at half of the picture and the other half was
strongly deflationary.

The nominal and real components of QC make roughly
equivalent contributions to its total variation.

The

standard deviation of QC is .08 while that of the nominal
component is .05 and that of the real component is.06 over
the 1947-85 period. Since these components are in principle
(and by construction) uncorrelated, it follows that each by

itself explains, in a regression sense, about half of the
variation in QC, with a bit more explanatory power coming
from the real component.
5.

Comparison With Univariate Trend-Cycle Decomposition

Traditional statistical methods are univariate in that

they attempt to infer the paths of trend and cycle
components just from the past history of the variable
itself.

In deterministic trend models the trend line is

chosen to minimize cyclical deviations.

In the unobserved

components model with a random walk stochastic trend
suggested by Harvey, the trend component has additional
flexibility to track the series and the resulting cyclical

deviations are smaller. Clark finds deviations from linear
•trend in post-war U.S. real GNP of up to 8 percent while the

random walk specification for trend reduces this range to
about 5 percent. Not surprisingly, the duration of cyclical

episodes is also reduced, with the 1965-1974 period being

19

entirely above trend in the linear trend case but being
interrupted by the 1970 recession in the random walk case.

Watson and Clark also present estimates of trend using

the Beveridge/Nelson method which defines the trend to be

the long range forecast of the series based on its
autocorrelation structure. It does not impose independence

between trend and cycle as does the unobserved components
model. For real GNP the Beveridge/Nelson cycle component is

small, with a range of only a couple of percent, and
variation in real GNP is dominated by variation in trend.

This result follows computationally from the fact that

quarterly log changes in real GNP are only weakly
autocorrelated during the 1947—1985 period with an AR(1)
coefficient of .37. Since resulting forecasted changes will

be small, the Beveridge/Nelson trend value will differ
relatively little from the actual value at any point in
time.

The unobserved components model produces more

variation in the cyclical component by insisting that it
move independently of trend.

At the other end of the spectrum in variation and
persistence is the cycle implied by the transfer function
model. Recall from Figure 4 that the cycle ranges from -.16
to + .18 and makes only one major upswing during the entire

post-war period. How is it possible that the real GNP data

by itself could contain so little information about the
trend that the two become virtually indistinguishable in the

Beveridge/Nelson decomposition? The transfer function model

20

suggests why this is so.

Note that the model can be

rewritten as approximately
(19)

(1 —

.9L) qt = .75(1—L)y + (l—.5L)ut

deleting the constant for clarity. This would seem to imply

strong autocorrelation

in growth rates q since the

coefficient on lagged q is .9.

The univariate ARMA

representation of q will also, however, involve the ARMPi
representation of y which is AR(1), as noted before, with
coefficient .45.

Substituting for y and denoting its

innovation again by e we have
(20)

(l—.9L) (1—.45L)q =

.75(l—L)et

+ (1—.95L + .225L2)ut.

The MA part of the process will be MA(2) but since the
variance of e is five times as large as the variance of u it

will be dominated by the first order MA in c which has a
unit root. Dividing (20) through by the operator (1-9L) we
have approximately
(21)

(l—.45L)q

.75et + Ut.

The ? parameter that accumulates movements in y and qn into

the large and persistent variations we saw in QC has
effectively canceled out of the univariate representation.

We could hope to detect it only with a very long data
record.

Therefore q will display relatively weak

autocorrelation with a pattern typical of AR(l) behavior.

21

The additional information that the transfer function gets
from y is lost in the univariate model.

Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Research

The methodology for decomposition of aggregate output

into natural, trend, and cyclical components suggested in

this paper turns away from the statistically convenient
assumption of independence and proposes instead that the
decomposition be model-based.

In general, fluctuations in

output are attributable to nominal shocks and the path of
the natural level of output.

The idea is to solve for the.

implied path of the natural level given the model and data
on observable nominal and real variables.

The model used here is a heuristic representation of

partial price level adjustment which assumes that the
natural rate process proceeds independently of nominal
shocks summarized by nominal GNP. Perhaps surprisingly, the

model is not strongly at variance with post-war data. The

point here though is not to test a theory but to try a
different approach to a fundamental problem in economic
measurement.

The implied natural level of GNP itself

separates conveniently into a random walk plus noise; the

former being a stochastic trend and the latter purely
transitory, perhaps the weather. Variation in the natural
level is not independent of the implied business cycle but
rather they are negatively correlated, the latter depending

directly on the former.

The cycle component of GNP is

22

highly autocorrelated and its historical pattern corresponds

with the

conventional

account

of the build-up

of

inflationary pressure in the 1960's and 1970's and the
disinflation of the 1980's. The relation of this series to

other cyclical indicators, such as the unemployment rate,
bears further investigation.

The cycle component can be

separated into the part due to nominal shocks and the part

due to movements in the natural rate.

These show quite

different patterns although they contribute about equally to

total variation. It would appear that the natural rate has

played a primary role, for example, in the disinflation of
the 1980's.
