1. Introduction
Does the impact of environmental regulation differ by plant vintage and technology? In other
words, can plants of different ages and which employ different technologies more easily comply with
environmental regulation than others? To answer this question we use annual Census Bureau
information on 116 pulp and paper mill's vintage, technology, productivity, and pollution abatement
operating costs over the time period 1979-1990.
Previous research on the impact of environmental regulation on productivity can be split into two
groups: growth accounting studies and econometric studies. Growth accounting studies use estimates of
compliance costs to calculate productivity effects (see Dension [1979]) and typically find only a small
impact on productivity because compliance costs are a small share of total costs. On the other hand,
econometric studies like Gollop and Roberts (1983) use plant-level data, and Gray (1986,1987) and
Barbera and McConnell (1986) use industry-level data in a more formal multiple regression framework
to test for regulation's impact on productivity. These econometric studies generally find significant
negative impacts of regulation on productivity, although not always very large ones.
Our study builds upon earlier work by Gray and Shadbegian (1995) which finds a significant
connection between pollution abatement costs and productivity at plants in the steel, oil, and paper
industries. Gray and Shadbegian find a larger impact than would be expected in a simple growth
accounting framework. In particular, at paper mills, $1.00 of abatement costs translated into the
equivalent of $1.80 or more in lower productivity. For oil the estimated impacts were smaller than
those for paper, $1.40; for steel they were larger, approximately $3.30, but more variable across
specifications. These results suggest that estimates of the economic impact of regulation based on
reported abatement costs may be understated. They also indicate that regulatory burdens differ across

1

industries, not only because they face different abatement costs, but also because a given amount of
abatement costs has different impacts across industries. Therefore, policy-makers should evaluate the
impact of environmental regulation on an industry-by-industry basis, to avoid substantial under- (or
over-) estimates.
In this paper we take the analysis further, by looking at differences in the impact of
environmental regulation across different plants within a single industry. We concentrate on the pulp and
paper industry for a number of reasons. First, the industry is a major polluter, with both air and water
pollution concerns, and it spends more on pollution abatement than most other manufacturing industries.
Second, the plants in the industry operate a variety of production technologies, differing substantially in
the pollution they generate. Finally, a significant and stable negative relationship between abatement
costs and productivity was found by Gray and Shadbegian (1995), suggesting the possibility of finding
significant differences across paper mills of different vintages and technologies.
Using a Census Bureau panel dataset on 116 pulp and paper mills, we find a significant negative
relationship between pollution abatement costs and productivity levels, which is almost entirely due to
mills which incorporate a pulping process -- these mills are referred to 'integrated mills'. Since
integrated mills also have higher abatement costs (twice as large as their non-pulping counterparts), the
predicted impact of regulation on productivity for integrated mills is especially large. For example, a one
standard deviation increase in abatement costs at an integrated mill is predicted to reduce its
productivity level by 5.4 percent. The results for vintage are generally not significant, with some
indication that older plants have lower productivity but are slightly less sensitive to abatement costs,
perhaps due to 'grandfathering' of regulations. Lastly, mills which have recently undergone a large
renovation are less sensitive to abatement costs, although these results are also not generally significant.
We also examine the impact of abatement costs using a production function model. We

2

estimate a log-linear version of a three input Cobb-Douglas production function in which we include our
technology, vintage, and renovation variables. The results for PAOC and its interactions with
technology, vintage, and renovation are similar to those found in the earlier tables: controlling for the
contributions of inputs, output is lower in plants with greater abatement costs, with nearly all of this
impact concentrated in integrated mills.
Sample calculations of the impact of pollution abatement on productivity show the importance of
allowing for differences based on plant technology. In a model incorporating technology interactions we
estimate that total pollution abatement costs reduced productivity by an average of 4.7 percent across
all the plants. The comparable estimate without technology interactions is 3.3 percent, approximately
30% lower. Our results also suggest that increased regulatory stringency might affect industry structure,
if higher abatement costs put integrated mills at a competitive disadvantage.
Section 2 describes paper industry technologies and how they are affected by regulation, along
with a model of the impact of regulation on productivity. Section 3 describes the data used in the
analyses. In Section 4 we present the results, with concluding remarks in Section 5.

2. Paper Industry Productivity and Environmental Regulation
Over the past thirty years, environmental standards in the U.S. have grown increasingly more
stringent, with frequent changes in the level of pollution control required. Before 1970 environmental
regulation was done primarily by state and local agencies -- for the most part without very serious
enforcement mechanisms. With the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in the early
1970s, and the passage of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, the federal government took a lead
role in regulation, imposing more stringent regulations with correspondingly stricter enforcement. Since

3

the early 1970's, regulations have been tightened, with some shifts in emphasis from basic air and water
quality in the 1970s to toxic chemicals in the 1980s.
Increased regulation has led to substantial increases in pollution abatement spending, nearly
tripling from 0.3 percent of total manufacturing shipments in 1973 to 1 percent in 1993. However
existing productivity measures do not distinguish between abatement spending and other production
costs, thus they will tend to reduce 'measured' productivity. Productivity is a ratio of output to inputs, so
if one plant has 2 percent higher costs due to pollution abatement, it would be expected to have 2
percent lower productivity (Gray 1987). This proportional mismeasurement is the basis for the analysis
used in Gray and Shadbegian (1995) where a plant's productivity level is regressed on its abatement
costs as a share of total cost -- the 'expected' coefficient on abatement costs is -1. A larger (more
negative) coefficient would indicate that the abatement cost numbers understate the 'true' abatement
costs for the plant.1 If certain types of plants have more complicated abatement problems, we might
expect to find their productivity especially sensitive to their pollution abatement costs.
The paper-making process is a heavily polluting one, generating both air and water pollution.
The first, and dirtiest, stage of the process is pulping, where some source of fiber (ranging from trees
and wood chips to recycled cardboard or waste paper) is treated to separate out the fibers, bleached in
some cases to increase whiteness, and mixed with water to form a slurry. In the second stage, this
slurry (more than 90% water at the start) is deposited on a rapidly-moving wire mesh which then passes
through a series of dryers to remove the water and create a continuous sheet of paper.
From the standpoint of environmental impact, the pulping stage provides most of the pollution,
and most of the differences across plants. If the plant uses raw wood for input, the fibers must be
1

For this estimation to exactly capture the effects of mismeasurement, the unmeasured part of
abatement costs needs to be proportional to the measured abatement costs.

4

separated from the lignin that binds them together; this can be done chemically, mechanically, or with
various combinations of heat, pressure, and chemicals. If the plant uses recycled cardboard or paper, it
is easier to separate the fibers, but there can be other waste material in the input stream, generating
sizable amounts of sludge with its own disposal problems. The paper-making process has smaller
pollution problems, with less variation across plants: air pollution associated with a power-generating
boiler (needed to create steam for the dryers) and water pollution from residual fibers remaining in the
water as the paper is dried. Therefore, we will focus on the distinction between integrated mills and
non-pulping plants as the key technology difference across plants.
Over time, the paper industry has substantially reduced its pollution. Nearly all plants have
installed secondary treatment of wastewater, reducing traditional forms of water pollutants. Plants with
boilers have generally installed electrostatic precipitators to reduce particulate emissions, and scrubbers
to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to these 'end-of-pipe' controls, the material flow through
the plants has been more closely controlled, with fibers in the wastewater being recovered and reused,
and exhaust gases from the pulping and bleaching stages being captured and treated. The recapture of
fiber may provide a net economic benefit to the plant, in addition to the pollution reductions.
Once a plant is in operation, it is very difficult to change the production process. For example,
older plants generally have problems with recapturing fiber from the waste stream (some early paper
mills were built over water with holes in the floor so that spills could be 'conveniently' disposed of!). In
any plant, changing the chemistry in one part of the process can change the capacity requirements in
another area.2 These problems, expected to be most serious in plants that were designed before
2

For example, installing oxygen delignification (reducing the need for chlorine bleaching) in one plant
would increase the flow of waste material to a recovery boiler by 3 percent. Because the recovery boiler
was designed to match the capacity of the rest of the process, the plant would either need to spend tens of
millions of dollars for a new recovery boiler, or accept a 3 percent reduction in pulp production.

5

environmental concerns were prominent, may be partially or completely offset by the tendency for
regulations to include grandfather clauses which exempt existing plants from the most stringent
regulations. For example, air pollution regulations apply stricter New Source Performance Standards
only to new or substantially renovated plants. Several authors have noted the possibility that such
regulations may have perverse effects on total emissions, discouraging investment in newer capital, both
in electric power generation and automobiles.
Based on the above discussion, we would expect plants that incorporate some pulping process
starting with raw wood to have higher abatement costs than plants with only the paper-making part of
the process -- this might or might not translate into a larger impact per dollar of abatement costs. We
also expect older plants to be less productive -- they might have more difficulty meeting a given
standard, leading to higher abatement costs, but grandfathering could reduce or eliminate this difference.
To describe the model more formally, let TFPit and PAOCit represent the total factor
productivity level and pollution abatement spending level in plant i at time t, with technology and vintage
variables Xi:
(1) TFPit = αi + β PAOC it + ∑ k γ xk X ik + ∑ k δ xk X ik PAOC it + λt + εit .

The X variables in this equation are all dummies, and the lack of a time subscript reflects their inherently
cross-sectional nature. Equation (1) is estimated in both levels and first-differences, where firstdifferencing controls for the plant-specific fixed effects (αi ). All models include time effects ( λt ). The
technology and vintage X variables are fixed, therefore they drop out of the first-differenced estimations,
but the X*PAOC terms remain; this allows for different impacts of PAOC on productivity for each
technology or vintage group. A negative γ coefficient indicates a technology (or vintage) with lower

6

productivity. A negative δ coefficient indicates a technology (or vintage) whose productivity is more
sensitive to abatement costs, or for which abatement costs are especially understated.3
The productivity levels TFPit are the residuals from a three-input production function model, in
which output levels are regressed on labor, capital, and materials inputs -- this specification is described
more fully in Gray and Shadbegian (1995). Our productivity measures are similar to those that would
be obtained from a growth accounting framework, calculating factor cost shares rather than estimating
coefficients econometrically. The productivity regressions are done in log form, expressed relative to a
base of 100, so a difference of 10 in TFPit can be interpreted as a 10 percent difference in productivity
levels.
An alternative method for testing the impact of pollution abatement costs on productivity comes
through production function estimation. We use a simple Cobb-Douglas production function,
comparable to the one used to calculate the productivity measure TFP in equation (1). Output (Q) is a
function of three inputs (IPj): labor, capital, and materials. The technology and vintage dummies (Xi) are
still allowed to interact with PAOC.
(2) Qit = αi + β PAOC it + ∑ k γ xk X ik + ∑ k δ xk X ik PAOC it + ∑ j φ j IP j + λ t + εit .

Equation (2) is also estimated in both levels and first-differences.

3. Data and Econometric Issues
The basic data for the project comes from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD) which
3

The symmetry between sensitivity and mismeasurement is really a matter of definition, since the
same result (lower than expected output for plants facing higher pollution abatement efforts) would arise
in each case.

7

contains information on manufacturing plants from the Census of Manufacturers and Annual Survey of
Manufacturers linked together for individual plants over time (for a more detailed description of the
LRD data, see McGuckin and Pascoe (1988)). Our data set consists of 116 pulp and paper plants
with continuous data over the 1979-1990 period -- this data set provides the productivity measure
(TFP) used in our basic analysis.4
We also use information from the LRD for the production function analysis. The value of
shipments is adjusted for inventory changes and deflated by the industry price of shipments (using the
paper industry deflator from Bartelsman and Gray [1996]) to measure a plant's output. Three inputs are
used: labor, capital, and materials. Labor is measured in terms of worker hours, using production
worker hours and assuming non-production workers work 2000 hours per year. Nominal materials
and energy expenditures are divided by an industry price index to put them in real terms. A real capital
stock measure is constructed from an examination of year-to-year variations in book value,
incorporating data on new investment in the plant and retirements of existing capital.5
We combine this productivity data with other Census information. The Pollution Abatement
Costs and Expenditures (PACE) survey, conducted annually by the Census Bureau, provides annual
abatement cost data from 1979 to 1990.6 We use a plant's pollution abatement operating costs divided
by its shipments to summarize the plant’s pollution abatement expenditures (PAOC).7

4

The plants are classified in either SIC 2611 (pulp) or 2621 (paper), depending on which accounts
for a larger part of the plant's shipments.
5

For a detailed description of this technique see Doms (1996).

6

No survey was done in 1987 for budget reasons, and we interpolate that year's data.

7

To avoid year-to-year variation in shipments, we use the peak two years of shipments from the
sample for the denominator. Some plants have a few years of missing data for pollution abatement
costs, but these are interpolated, based on their values for surrounding years.

8

We use detailed information on plant output from the LRD to ascertain whether or not a plant
has pulping technology (PULP). LRD data on annual investment spending is used to create two capitalvintage variables: RENOV and OLD. RENOV is a 'recent major upgrade' dummy variable -- this is
defined as having total new investment over a two-year period exceeding 80 percent of the plant's initial
capital stock, and remains 'turned on' for three years after the investment. OLD is a dummy variable
indicating if a plant opened before 1960.8 We choose to present the results for a single dummy (OLD)
for several reasons. First, our sample includes some very old plants, likely to heavily influence any linear
(or non-linear) age specification. Second, concern with environmental issues was not prominent before
the 1960s. Third, in earlier analyses we explored splitting OLD into three time period dummies. Each
of the three periods had the same sign, as did their interactions with PAOC, though there was some
variation across the three time periods' coefficients.9
We employ a variety of estimation methods, beginning in each case with ordinary least squares.
We then estimate the model in first-differences, to control for plant-specific fixed effects. Estimation
using first-differences is desirable on theoretical grounds, since this minimizes the possibility of
unmeasured plant characteristics biasing the other coefficients. However, some of our coefficients of
interest are purely cross-sectional, such as plant vintage, so they drop out of the first-differenced
models. Other variables may have limited within-plant variation, providing little information for the firstdifferenced models to work with, and possibly exacerbating problems with measurement error.
Another problem is the possibility of the endogeneity of PAOC, either in terms of levels or first-

We would like to thank John Haltiwanger who developed the plant age data based on LRD data.

These results are available from the authors. Some of the individual age dummy coefficients may
not be 'disclosable' (outside the Census Bureau), due to the Census Bureau's disclosure rules.

differences. We are limited by the lack of clearly exogenous (and time-varying) instruments to explain
differences in PAOC, so we use a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) model suggested by
Arellano and Bond (1991), which incorporates all possible lagged levels and differences of the
endogenous variables to serve as instruments for the current values of the endogenous variables in the
model.10

4. Estimation Results
Table 1 presents summary statistics for all the variables used in the analysis. Slightly less than
half the plants in the sample have a pulping process (PULP). Almost all plants were opened before
1960 (OLD), with over a third of the observations falling within three years of a major renovation
(RENOV). We also find sizable differences in pollution abatement spending between the different
subgroups of plants. The largest difference is for PULP: plants with pulping facilities spend twice as
much as those without pulping. Plants started before 1960 (OLD), or undergoing a recent renovation
(RENOV) also have somewhat higher abatement cost spending (although the precise figures cannot be
reported here due to Census Bureau disclosure rules). Abatement costs are expressed relative to the
plant's shipments, therefore these PAOC differences are not simply due to differences in the scale of
different types of plants.
Table 2 examines the relationship between productivity and the technology measure (PULP),
using OLS and first-differenced estimates of equation (1). First, we see a strong pattern of year effects
throughout the models. The coefficients appear different across the three sets of models (OLS-levels,
OLS-differences, and GMM-differences), but this reflects differences in specification and base years.
10

Other papers using this technique include Black and Lynch (1996), Arellano (1995), and Arrelano
and Bover (1995).

10

The OLS-levels models (2a -2b) show that the highest levels of productivity were in 1983, 1985 and
1986, and the lowest levels in 1980, 1989, and 1990. Several years show large changes in coefficients
between years, falling for 1979-1980, 1986-1987, and 1987-1988 and rising for 1982-1983 and
1984-1985. When we move to OLS-differences these changes in coefficients (from 2a-2b) become
the coefficients themselves (in 2c-2d), and are all positive because the base difference, 1979-1980, is
the largest negative value in the period. Finally, the GMM-differences model drops the first year of data
in creating instruments, so the base difference is now 1980-1981, which is slightly positive, making the
year dummy coefficients in models 2e-2f more negative than those in 2c-2d, though with similar relative
coefficients. The year effects are consistent across all of the remaining tables, so they are omitted from
later tables to save space.
We note that plants with higher abatement costs have lower productivity levels, for both the
estimators. The impact is about –2.2, substantially larger than the expected -1.0 for the OLS model
estimated in levels (2a). Going to first-differences in OLS reduces the coefficient to just under –1
(model 2c). When we move to a GMM specification of the first-differenced model, the coefficient
returns to the higher level of the OLS-level specification (model 2e), suggesting that some of the drop in
the PAOC coefficient in model 2c may have been due to endogeneity (and corrected for by the GMM
instruments). Using the simplest OLS results, a one standard deviation (1.162) increase in PAOC
(model 2a) is predicted to reduce a plant's productivity level by 2.9 percent. We also see significant
differences in productivity levels across technologies: integrated mills have significantly higher
productivity levels -- approximately 10% higher.
Our main focus here is on the interaction between abatement cost and technology. Plants
including a pulping process (integrated mills) show a significantly larger impact of abatement costs on

11

productivity than plants without a pulping process. Note that even the first-differenced model, which
indicates a relatively small impact of abatement costs on productivity, shows a net effect of abatement
costs on productivity of -1.93 for integrated mills (model 2D). In fact, the evidence suggests that
virtually all of the estimated relationship between abatement costs and productivity comes from
integrated mills, since the PAOC coefficient is no longer significantly negative after the PULP
interactions are included (even becoming significantly positive in the first-differenced models).
The predicted impacts of PAOC on productivity for integrated mills are quite large. A one
standard deviation increase in PAOC for an integrated mill in the simplest OLS model (2b) is predicted
to reduce the plant's productivity by 5.4 percent (-4.51*1.19). The corresponding figures for the firstdifferenced OLS and GMM models are 2.3 and 4.7 percent, respectively. The estimated impacts of
PAOC on non-integrated mills are much smaller, and even turn surprisingly positive in the firstdifferenced models.
A second way to measure the importance of allowing for differences in impact across plants
with different production technologies is to calculate the total impact of pollution abatement costs on
productivity at the average plant. For model 2a, this involves multiplying the mean value of PAOC
(1.493) times its coefficient (-2.194) for a total impact of 3.3 percent lower productivity levels. For
model 2b, we must distinguish between integrated mills and non-integrated mills. The impact of PAOC
for integrated mills is larger than for non-integrated mills for two reasons: the mean value of PAOC is
higher for integrated mills (2.035 vs. 1.037) and the estimated marginal impact of PAOC is larger for
integrated mills (-4.51 vs. -0.751). Therefore the total impact of PAOC on integrated and nonintegrated mills is to reduce productivity by 9.2 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Averaging the
total impacts for the two types of plants, weighted by their shares in the population (45.7 percent
integrated), we get a total estimated impact on industry productivity of 4.6 percent. This is substantially

12

larger than the 3.3 percent impact estimated without allowing for different impacts. 11
Table 3 looks at the relationship between plant vintage and productivity. We find that plants
born before 1960 are less productive than newer plants -- 10% to 11% less productive. Again, we are
more interested in the interaction between OLD and PAOC, which is generally positive across the
different specifications, but not significant. The positive coefficient suggests that older plants are less
seriously affected, per dollar of abatement costs.12 When we include PULP and PULP*PAOC
(models 3b and 3d), the results for OLD remain fairly similar. The results for PULP and PULP*PAOC
are almost identical to those found in Table 2.
We must be careful when interpreting these results, because we cannot distinguish between
mismeasured abatement costs and reduced productivity of other inputs. One interpretation of the results
is that older plants are grandfathered, and therefore are not required to meet such stiff regulatory
standards as newer plants – enough to offset the presumed greater difficulty for older plants in changing
their production processes to comply. Another
interpretation of the results is that older plants tend to do more of their pollution abatement with
end-of-pipe methods (water treatment plants and scrubbers on smokestacks), which are easier to
measure. Thus, if newer plants choose to make (or are required to make) more change-in-productionprocess expenditures, and these expenditures are harder to measure than end-of-pipe ones, we could
have a greater mismeasurement of abatement costs in newer plants, leading to a larger (more negative)
PAOC coefficient for them.
In Table 4, we add RENOV to the models, identifying those plants which receive large
11

The GMM results, in contrast, show relatively little difference between the two impact estimates.

12

Although older plants have higher mean abatement costs, their smaller coefficients more than outweigh
this, and the overall impact of abatement costs (mean*coefficient) is smaller for older plants. As noted

13

additional investments during the period. Newly-renovated plants show significantly smaller impacts of
PAOC on productivity (a positive interaction term) in the OLS models, although this effect goes away in
the first-differenced models. To the extent that there is a real difference, it may indicate that newlyrenovated plants have fewer problems complying with environmental regulations, or that they are better
able to measure their pollution abatement costs. Adding OLD and PULP dummies and interaction
terms gives similar results to Tables 2 and 3 -- higher productivity levels for integrated mills, lower
productivity levels for older plants, negative interactions for PULP*PAOC, and positive interactions for
OLD*PAOC. However, the only consistently significant effect is the PULP*PAOC interaction.
Tables 5-7 present the same sets of analyses, but now instead of using a previously estimated
productivity index, we estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function (log-output as a function of loginputs) along with the technology, vintage, and renovation variables by both OLS and first-differences.
The methods give somewhat different results for the contribution of individual inputs. The OLS version
(5a) generates coefficients (.69 for materials, .19 for labor, and .12 for capital) that are quite similar to
the input cost shares that would be used in growth accounting calculations (.71, .17, and .12
respectively), with estimated returns to scale of 0.994. The first-differenced results are quite different,
with the estimated capital coefficient near zero, and overall returns of scale about 0.92. This supports
the finding in past research that it is difficult to identify the positive contribution of capital to output using
year-to-year fluctuations in capital within plants.13 The results for PAOC and its interactions with
technology, vintage, and renovation are similar to those found earlier: controlling for the contributions of
inputs, output is lower in plants with greater abatement costs, with nearly all of this impact due to

earlier, we cannot report the precise numbers due to Census disclosure rules.

integrated mills. The positive interactions of OLD and RENOV with PAOC are more consistently
positive than they were in the earlier tables, but are still generally not significant. This reinforces the
importance of controlling for differences in production technology (and possibly other plant
characteristics) when estimating the impact of environmental regulation on plants in a given industry.

5. Conclusions
The relationship between pollution abatement costs and productivity shows some differences by
plant vintage and production technology. We provide evidence that, on average, pulp and paper mills
with higher abatement costs have significantly lower productivity levels. We also find that the
relationship between abatement costs and lower productivity is almost entirely due to integrated mills,
which show a much larger marginal impact than non-pulping mills. Integrated mills also have much
higher abatement costs, therefore the predicted impact of regulation on productivity for integrated mills
is especially large. For example, a one standard deviation increase in PAOC for an integrated mill is
predicted to reduce the plant's productivity level by 5.4 percent.
Sample calculations of the impact of pollution abatement on productivity show the importance of
allowing for differences based on plant technology. In a model incorporating technology interactions we
estimate that total pollution abatement costs reduced productivity by an average of 4.6 percent across
all the plants. The comparable estimate without technology interactions is 3.3 percent, approximately
30% lower.
Our results for other plant characteristics are not generally statistically significant. We find some
differences in productivity level by vintage, with older plants having lower productivity, but being
somewhat less sensitive to abatement costs. This may reflect grandfathering of older plants, or
differences in abatement methods which make it easier to measure costs in older plants. We also find

15

that plants having recent renovations may be a bit less sensitive to abatement costs, but this effect is
generally not significant.
Combining a production function analysis with the technology, vintage, and renovation measures
(Tables 5-7), gives similar results to those found earlier. We still find there is a significant negative
relationship between abatement costs and output, larger than would have been expected if abatement
costs were perfectly measured -- this relationship is once again concentrated almost entirely in
integrated mills. Also, older mills, and newly-renovated mills, may be slightly less affected by abatement
costs. The production function part of the estimation shows some variation across models, with the
coefficients on the OLS-levels model corresponding most closely to the input cost shares (especially for
capital, which gets much smaller coefficients in the other models), and to constant returns to scale.
These results have shown the importance of having policy-makers account for the possibility of
different impacts of regulation on plants employing different production technologies. As shown above,
accounting for differences across plants can substantially affect estimates of the overall economic impact
of abatement costs. Our results also suggest that increased regulatory stringency might affect industry
structure, if higher abatement costs put integrated mills at a competitive disadvantage. Research seeking
to understand why these large differences in impact occur may provide deeper insights into the ways in
which environmental regulation affects productivity in the pulp and paper industry.
