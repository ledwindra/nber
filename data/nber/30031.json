    "abstract": "\n\nCountries that implement wealth taxes make many practical compromises regarding relative treatment and approach to valuation of different categories of assets in order to ease assessment and liquidity difficulties with this form of taxation. Relying on Norwegian variation in tax and base rules, we illustrate the resulting complexity and evaluate the effect of taxation on saving and portfolio composition. Our results highlight sensitivity of the strength of response to the base definition.\n\n",
