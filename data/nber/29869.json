    "abstract": "\n\nIn government-sponsored health insurance, subsidy design affects market outcomes. First, holding premiums fixed, subsidies determine insurance uptake and average cost. Insurers then respond to these changes, adjusting premiums. Combining data from the first four years of the California ACA marketplace with a model of insurance demand, cost, and insurers\u2019 competition, I quantify the impact of alternative subsidy designs on premiums, enrollment, costs, public spending, and consumer surplus. Younger individuals are more price sensitive and cheaper to cover.  Increasing subsidies to this group would make all buyers better off, increase market participation, and lower average costs and average subsidies.\n\n",
