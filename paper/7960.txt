Introduction

Whether an estate tax deserves a role in the U.S. tax system depends in part on its impact on
the behavior of potential donors. Opponents of the estate tax argue that it reduces the incentive
to accumulate wealth in two ways: by reducing the incentive to earn income, and by increasing
the incentive to consume. Supporters tend to downplay the salience of these incentives, and often
ascribe wealth accumulation to motives that are immune to taxation. For example, Sandford
(1984, p. 226) writes that “Much saving is undertaken with no thought of bequests in mind;
people accumulate property for a variety of reasons — future security and enjoyment; the power
that wealth confers; inertia — the sheer inability to spend their wealth; the desire to manage a
large business; the posthumous glory of dying rich; and many others which are unaffected by death
duty considerations.” Opponents of the estate tax also refer to the magnitude of avoidance it
engenders. For example, the U.S. Joint Economic Committee report asserts that “Virtually any
individual who invests sufficient time, energy and money in tax avoidance strategies is capable of
avoiding the estate tax altogether” (1998, p. 20). Both the impact on wealth accumulation and
the “time, energy, and money” devoted to avoidance should be counted as costs of levying the
estate tax, to be weighed against the revenue it raises in a highly progressive manner.
Although assertions about the impact of the estate tax are made with great confidence, there is
almost no empirical evidence to support either claims of a large effect or of a negligible effect. In this
paper we begin an empirical analysis of this issue, and proceed as follows. In section 2, we consider
theoretically the question of the impact of an estate tax on the behavior of a prospective donor.
Section 3 discusses the existing empirical literature. We then turn to an empirical investigation of
the impact of the estate tax. In section 4 we examine the effect of an estate tax on reported estates
in a time-series context, using aggregated data from estate tax raturns that span 1916 to 1996. In
section 5 we make use of individual tax return data to extend that analysis. Section 6 concludes.

Models of How the Estate Tax Affects Potential Donors’
Behavior

2.1

Modeling Choices

The impact of the estate tax on potential donors’ behavior depends critically on the nature and
motivation behind the bequest motive. This poses an immediate challenge, because there are
several different bequest motives considered in the literature. Bequests may be accidental, as a
consequence of uncertain lifespan and an imperfect market for life annuities (Davies 1981, Hurd
1989). They may reflect altruism, in the sense that the expected well-being of a child affects the
utility of a parent (Barro 1974).1 A parent may enjoy giving (Yaari 1965, Andreoni 1990), or he may
enjoy being wealthy (Carroll 2000), preventing him from running down resources at the end of life.
Bequests may also reflect some strategic interactions, e.g., with parents attempting to manipulate
their children’s behavior by holding out the chance of an inheritance (Bernheim, Shleifer and
Summers 1985). They may also be a form of contract between subsequent generations (Kotlikoff
and Spivak 1981). In what follows, we focus on a model with altruism and without strategic
interactions between the parents and children, in order to highlight how taxes affect the key
incentives of the donor.

2.2

A Model with No Uncertainty

In order to later highlight the role of uncertainty, we begin with a simple model with none at all.
Consider an individual who values leisure and consumption during his life, and who also values the
well-being of his heir.2 We can represent the individual’s decision problem as follows



max u C, L, G, v(y, I)

(1)

= wL − T (wL) − C ,

(2)

= W − G − E(W − G − A) − D(W, A) .

is also literature on two-sided altruism; for a survey see Laitner (1997, section 3.1).
present purposes, we model an unmarried person with a single heir.

2

Here C and L represent lifetime consumption and labor supply, respectively, w is the wage rate,
T (·) is the income tax function, and W is the total bequeathable estate. G represents charitable
bequests (which are deducted from the estate tax base). The individual cares about the heir’s
utility, v, which depends on his own endowment y and on I, the after-tax inheritance received by
the heir; E(·) is the estate tax function. Taxes may be avoided at the cost of D(W, A), where
A represents the amount of taxable income reduction. This specification allows, as in Slemrod
(forthcoming), for the marginal cost of avoidance to be lower for larger estates, reflecting scale
economies in avoidance, so that DW < 0 and DA > 0. Combining the first-order conditions leads
to the following characterization of the optimal plan:
C:
L:
G:
A:

=

1 − E 0 (W − G − A) ,

= E 0 (W − G − A) .

(4)
(5)
(6)
(7)

The first-order conditions for this problem reveal that the marginal estate tax rate increases the
cost of leaving an inheritance relative to consumption, leisure and charitable bequests. As with any
tax, there will also be an income effect that, as long as all the goods are normal, will reduce C and
I, and increase L (because leisure, not its complement labor, is the normal good). Of more interest
(because it is unique to an estate tax) is the substitution effect, which will certainly reduce I and
will increase C when it is not complementary to I (or, more precisely, complementary to the utility
of children), and reduce L when leisure is not complementary to I. Absent complementarity, the
substitution effect implies that end-of-life wealth will be lower with an estate tax, both because
labor supply will be lower than otherwise and consumption will be higher than otherwise. In
general, it is not possible to sign the uncompensated response. Finally, estate taxes are avoided
up to the point where the marginal tax saving is equal to the marginal cost. To the extent that
greater wealth facilitates avoidance (DW < 0), this mitigates the disincentive effect of the estate
tax on both saving and labor supply. Thus, whether avoidance opportunities soften the impact of
the estate estate tax on “real” behavior depends on the technology of avoidance. This continues
to be true in the models that follow, although for the sake of simplicity we ignore avoidance from
3

this point on.
This model generalizes in a straightforward way to deal with multiple periods of life. For
tractability, we consider a special case in which the utility of N different periods is additively
separable, so that
 X

u C1 , L1 , . . . , CN , LN , G, v(y, I) =
ρi u(Ci , Li ) + ρN +1 h(v(y, I), G) ,


(8)

i=1

where ρ is the per-period rate of utility discounting and h is the utility derived from bequests to
heirs and charities.3 The optimum is characterized by a series of relationships.4 First, there is an
instantaneous optimality condition that relates consumption and leisure at each period of time,

uC (Ci , Li )
= w 1 − T 0 (wLi ) ,
uL (Ci , Li )

(9)

which states that the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and consumption should be
equal to the wage rate net of the marginal income tax rate. Second, there are Euler equations that
describe the evolution of consumption and leisure over time,
uC (Ci , Li )
uC (Ci+1 , Li+1 )
uL (Ci , Li )
uL (Ci+1 , Li+1 )

= ρ(1 + r) ,
= ρ(1 + r)

1 − T 0 (wLi )
,
1 − T 0 (wLi+1 )

i = 1...N − 1,

(10)

i = 1...N − 1.

(11)

Equation 10 states that the marginal rates of substitution between consumption in adjoining periods should depend on the pure discount rate and the rate of interest (pre-tax, because we have
not introduced capital taxes into the model). Equation 11 is the equivalent for labor supply, which
must be adjusted across time for any changes in the marginal income tax rate. Finally, there
are terminal conditions that relate consumption in the last period of life to the inheritance and
charitable bequest,
uC (CN , LN )
hv vI (y, I)
hG (v(y, I), G)
hv vI (y, I)
uL (CN , LN )
−
hv vI (y, I)

(12)

(14)

that, because there is no uncertainty, there will never be a need for the individual to diverge from the

consumption, work and bequest plan set out at the beginning of life.
4 In deriving these conditions, we assume that there are no borrowing constraints and that terminal wealth is
constrained to be non-negative.

4

Without a bequest motive, the terminal condition would guarantee that the individual just
exhausts his resources at the end of life. In the presence of a bequest motive, the estate is set so
that the individual is just indifferent between consuming or working and leaving an inheritance.
(This is conceptually identical to the analysis of the one-period model.) Holding wealth at the
beginning of the last period constant, the estate tax induces an unambiguous substitution response
toward more consumption and leisure.5 Due to the presence of a counteracting income response, it
is not possible to sign the total effect. The Euler equations, which characterize the optimal paths
of consumption and leisure, require that consumption (and leisure) in each period move in the
same direction. In other words, a change in the estate tax shifts the lifetime consumption/labor
profile without affecting its shape. However, both upward and downward shifts are consistent with
the theory, depending on whether the income or substitution response to the estate tax of lifetime
consumption and leisure dominates.

2.3

A Model with Uncertain Lifetime

In spite of Benjamin Franklin’s injunction that the only certain things in life are death and taxes,
uncertainty plays an important role in understanding the impact of estate taxes on donors’ behavior. There is uncertainty about future income realizations of potential donors. This is the
consideration that originally gave rise to the literature on the precautionary motive for saving.6
There may be uncertainty about future medical expenses and long-term care (see, Hubbard, Skinner and Zeldes 1994). There may be uncertainty about the endowment and therefore the well-being
of the future generations, considered by Strawczynski (1994). Finally, there may also be uncertainty about the future rules that govern the taxation of wealth transfers. For example, individuals
might want to avoid inter vivos gifts if they think that estate taxes may be reduced in the future.
We focus on the uncertainty about the lifespan of the donor, which affects decisions of the
donor through a precautionary motive – the desire to avoid “outliving” one’s resources. It is this
5 Because

of the assumed additively separable form of utility function, an increase in the price of inheritance

induces a substitution response toward the composite good consisting of C and L. It does not affect the relative
prices of consumption and leisure so that when both these goods are normal, as we assume, they both increase.
6 Note that if the uncertainty regarding income or wealth is resolved after most labor supply, human capital, and
saving decisions are made, then taxation of estates may be very efficient, because it is a tax on luck.

aspect that, in the presence of an imperfect market for annuities, produces accidental bequests.7
As is conventional in this literature, we assume that consumers are not allowed to freely purchase
life annuities, but that some are exogenously available via Social Security benefits.8
As in the previous model, we consider an individual who maximizes an intertemporal utility
function that depends on consumption, leisure and bequests left at death.9 In the presence of
uncertainty, it is assumed that the individual is an expected utility maximizer, and so seeks to
maximize

where as before Ci and Li are consumption and labor in period i, Ii is the (after-tax) inheritance
left in case of death in period i, u(·) and v(·)10 are the instantaneous utilities from consumption
and inheritances respectively, N is the maximum possible age, and ρ is the rate of time preference.
We introduce some new notation, so that ai is the survival rate and mi is the mortality rate. The
mortality rate mi is the probability of dying at the beginning of period i, and ai is the probability
of being alive at the end of period i. The individual lives in the first period, so it is natural to
assume that a1 = 1 and m1 = 0; she may live at most N periods so that aN +1 = 0. Mortality and
survival rates are linked by the relation mi = ai−1 − ai or, equivalently, ai = ai−1 − mi .
Optimization is, as in the certainty case, subject to the budget constraints,

(17)

are a number of papers that are concerned with consumer behavior in this context (see, e.g., Yaari 1965,

Richard 1975, Davies 1981, Abel 1985, Hurd 1989, Bernheim 1991). Some of these papers (Davies 1981, Abel 1985)
consider accidental bequests in isolation; others (Hurd 1989, Bernheim 1991) allow also for other types of bequest
motives.
8 Barro and Friedman (1977) noted that when insurance markets are perfect and actuarially fair, mortality and
survival rates do not affect consumption and bequest decisions. An intuition for this result is simple. A decrease
in the mortality rate increases the value of future consumption to an individual. At the same time, it increases
its price because annuities become more expensive when people are expected to live longer. With actuarially fair
insurance markets, these two effects cancel out.
9 For simplicity, we do not model charitable bequests.
10 With an appropriate interpretation of the function v(·), it may also be considered as a reduced form of the
altruistic model (Abel and Warshawsky 1988).

The Euler equation in this model can be written as follows:11


Compare equation (18) to the certainty version of equation (10). The marginal benefit of consumption is unchanged, but the marginal benefit of postponed consumption now must account for
the fact that it allows for either increased own consumption or an increased bequest, with the two
weighted by the probability of surviving until the next period. The estate tax reduces the payoff to
saving because it reduces the amount of inheritance that a unit of postponed consumption creates.
This effect is present in every period, but only next period’s marginal tax appears directly in any
single Euler equation, and its effect is proportional to the mortality rate. It would be a mistake,
however, to conclude that this is the full effect. Consumption after period t + 1 is also affected by
taxes, and from the Euler equation we may conclude that (expected) consumption in period t + 1
is a sufficient statistic for the influence of estate taxes after that period.
The estate tax also affects labor supply, as demonstrated by the presence of the tax term in
equation 19. The wage rate relevant for the labor supply/inheritance margin is w(1 − T 0 )(1 − E 0 ),
i.e., the estate tax reduces the payoff to working. As in the certainty case, labor supply and
consumption at a point in time are instantaneously related by equation 9, so that the relevant
wage rate on this margin is still w(1 − T 0 ).
As stressed by Hurd (1989), in the last possible period of life there are two possibilities: either
an individual is willing to leave a bequest, in which case terminal conditions (12-14) apply, or not,
in which case there are no such conditions and final consumption is pinned down based on the
budget constraint and the Euler equation.12 In general, the more wealthy an individual is, the
more likely it is that a bequest will be left. Leaving a bequest with certainty may be guaranteed
by imposing the condition that lim vI (y, I) = +∞, which implies that one wishes at all costs to
I→0

11 It

is assumed that the wealth constraints are not binding. If they were, this first-order condition would become

an inequality, with equality whenever the constraint is not binding.
12 Note that even though one may not wish to leave bequests upon reaching a certain age, the marginal utility
from bequests is still present in the Euler equation because accidental bequests also yield utility.

7

avoid the possibility of leaving no bequests at all.13
The Euler equation may be iterated forward to yield the following formula,
uC (C1 , L1 ) = aN ρN −1 (1 + r)N −1 uC (CN , LN ) +

mi ρi−1 (1 + r)i−1 vI (y, Ii ) 1 − E 0 (Wi ) . (20)


mi ρi−1 (1 + r)i−1 vI (y, Ii ) 1 − E 0 (Wi ) .

Equation (21) implies that consumption in any period depends on the value of mi (1 − E 0 (Wi )) for
all subsequent periods.

2.4

A Simulation Exercise

To get more insights into the nature of behavioral response and to empirical challenges we will
confront in Section 4 and 5, we can simulate individual behavior using a stylized utility function.
To do so, we assume that an individual maximizes lifetime utility given by

where Ci is consumption in period i, Bi is the bequest in case of death at the end of period i, ρ
is the discount factor, ai is the probability of survival until period i and mi is the probability of
death in period i. Initial wealth W25 is assumed to be zero. The simulated lifetime begins when
at age 25, and the maximum possible age is 115. Mortality and survival rates are taken from the
population actuarial life tables for males. Neither annuities nor life insurance are available, and
the optimization is subject to the following two constraints,

It is assumed that γ = 2, ρ = .97, r = .03, α = .1 and δ = .5γ. This last parameter implies that,
over the lifetime, bequests increase approximately twice as fast as consumption. The individual is

from bequests would be infinite, which may not be optimal.

assumed to have a constant stream of income of $200, 000 a year until the age of 65, and no income
thereafter.
Figures 1 and 2 consider the case in which the representative individual starts his economic
life facing the current U.S. tax system, and is convinced that it will be in effect for the rest of
his life. After 20 years of living in this regime, however, the tax system changes unexpectedly,
and the estate tax is abolished completely. What effect does this have on the lifetime pattern of
consumption and bequests?
Figure 1 shows the effect on the path of wealth accumulation, for two individuals who differ
only in level of endowment. Eliminating the tax increases wealth, and the effect gets larger with
age. Figure 2 shows the effect on the path of consumption. Consumption falls immediately, but
if one lives long enough, consumption may ultimately increase above what it would otherwise be.
An intuition for this result is as follows: at the maximum possible age, an individual is planning to
hold more wealth than he otherwise would. As a result, the marginal utility from leaving a bequest
is lower, and thus there is an incentive to consume more (than one otherwise would) close to that
date. It is important to note that the magnitude of the response to the tax change is sensitive to
the parameterization of the model.
There are several insights to be taken from this simple simulation. First, the effect of the
estate tax on wealth depends on the age of an individual. Second, the full effect is not visible
until many years after the tax reform. Finally, compare points A and B in figure 1. Although
point A is an observation from a zero estate tax regime and point B is an observation from a
high estate tax regime, the estate at B exceeds the wealth at A even though estate taxes reduce
wealth accumulation in this simulation model. The behavioral response to taxation will, though,
be revealed in an empirical anlaysis only to the extent that the level of endowment can be held
constant in some way. Because no information about lifetime income is available in the analysis
below, other assumptions are required.
More generally, the response of wealth accumulation to a change in the estate tax will depend
on the responsiveness of labor supply to a change in its net reward, and on the responsiveness of
lifetime consumption versus bequests to its relative price. This cannot be revealed by theoretical
analysis, but only by empirical analysis. Moreover, the income effect may partly or fully offset

9

the relative price effects, so the sign of the net effect is not definite. Finally, as Gale and Perozek
(this volume) emphasize, the qualitative effect of the estate tax on private saving depends on why
donors give bequests and how saving by the donee is affected. They argue that in plausible models
the estate tax may increase the combined saving of the donor and donee. The same point applies to
the avoidance response: theoretical reasoning can determine neither the magnitude of the response
nor the sensitivity of the response to the tax structure.
Both because the key parameters of the altruism model are unknown and because the “right”
model of bequests, be it altruism or some other, is unknown, the response of potential donors to the
estate tax is ultimately an empirical question. Before attempting to advance our understanding of
this question in Section 4, we next briefly review some relevant literature.

Previous Empirical Literature

3.1

The Effect of the Estate Tax on Wealth Accumulation

In his survey of the U.S. federal estate and gift tax, Joulfaian notes that estate taxes may reduce
the work effort and savings of parents motivated to leave large bequests to their children, but
states that “there is no empirical evidence” on either type of behavioral response (Joulfaian 1998b,
p. 25). Because the estate tax is a particular kind of tax on return to working and saving, the
large empirical literature on how the income tax affects these two decisions is, however, certainly
relevant. If taxes affect neither, it is unlikely that the estate tax could affect wealth accumulation.
We cannot adequately survey the enormous literature on these topics here, although we refer the
reader to the able surveys by Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) on labor supply and by Bernheim
(1997) on saving. Although the consensus of these literatures — that neither is very responsive to
taxes — suggests that the impact of the estate tax on wealth accumulation is not large, there is
almost no direct analysis of this question.
In an earlier era, Fiekowsky (1966) argued that there was no indication that estate accumulators
were discouraged by the sharply increased death tax rates introduced in the 1930s and early 1940s.
He asserts that if there had been such discouragement, one would have (but did not) observe three
phenomena: (i) the distribution of estate taxpayer estates would have become more equal, as the

10

larger estates failed to grow and the smaller estates (truly held for consumption) increased slightly,
(ii) the proportion of widows among estate taxpayers would have risen, as active accumulators
moved to thwart the IRS, since widows would report estates inherited from the prior generation of
unthwarted accumulators, and (iii) a marked effort to minimize transfer tax liabilities by making
gifts and creating generation-skipping transfers would have been manifested.

3.2

The Effect of the Estate Tax on Avoidance and Evasion

Tait (1967) estimates the extent of avoidance of the estate tax in Great Britain by comparing
the distribution of taxable estates in a low-tax year (1912) to the distribution in a high-tax year
(1960). He first applies 1960 estate tax rates to the 1912 distribution and expresses the tax yield
as a fraction of total wealth held in 1912. He then compares this figure to the actual 1960 revenue
yield as a fraction of total wealth held in 1960, and finds that the 1912 figures exceed these of 1960
by between 1.3 and 1.5 times. This leads Tait to conclude that avoidance amounts to between 34
and 50 percent of the potential 1960 base. Note, though, that the total wealth estimates in the
denominator are themselves derived from estate tax returns and are thus skewed by any avoidance.
Furthermore, the large time span between the two years suggests that much other than the tax
structure changed and may confound the methodology.
Wolff (1996) estimates U.S. estate tax avoidance by comparing the actual tax base to an estimate
of what the base “should be” based on the comprehensive wealth survey in the 1992 Survey of
Consumer Finances (SCF) conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. He first applies mortality
rates by age, gender, and race to the population represented by the 1992 SCF file. He calculates
the total net worth of decedents to be $241.5 billion in 1993, which compares to $99.4 reported
on estate tax returns. He then adjusts the net worth of each ”probabilistic” decedent by the
average marital and charitable giving deduction in the estate class and applies the federal estate
tax schedule. On this basis, Wolff’s simulation indicate that estate tax collections should have
been $44.5 billion in 1993, compared to $10.3 billion in actual collections. He concludes that more
effective enforcement of the estate tax might have yielded another $30 billion in revenue in 1993.
However, Poterba (2000) performs a similar exercise and concludes that the estimated tax liability corresponds quite closely to actual estate tax liability. The stark difference in conclusion is

11

partly due to the fact that Poterba uses a mortality table that describes the mortality experience of
individuals who purchase single-premium annuities from life insurance companies, who are generally from the upper tail of the wealth distribution and are arguably representative of the estate tax
paying population. In contrast, Wolff uses the population mortality table, and may therefore be
overestimating the fraction of wealthy people who are subject to estate tax in a given year.14 Eller,
Erard and Ho (this volume) revisit the Wolff-Poterba methodology, and find that the conclusions
are highly sensitive to assumptions about differential mortality rates of married and unmarried
individuals, and the distribution of charitable contributions across estates in a given gross estate
category. Because of this sensitivity, they caution against taking too seriously estimates of avoidance or evasion based on this type of approach. Moreover, these studies are attempts to estimate
the size of avoidance (and evasion), but none addresses the sensitivity of this magnitude to changes
in the estate tax structure.
Not only avoidance, but also (illegal) evasion, may be sensitive to the tax structure. However,
little is known about this effect. Certainly, the audit coverage of estate tax returns is relatively
high. Eller and Johnson (forthcoming) report that in 1992, 11,338 estate tax returns were audited,
which comprises 19.2% of the total number of filed returns. The audit rate increases with the size
of the gross estates, with an 11.1% audit rate of estate under $1 million, 26.5% of estates between
$1 million and $5 million, and 48.5% of estates over $5 million. Because of the concentration of
audits on the largest estates, although 19.2% were audited, returns with 63.2% of the reported tax
liability were subject to audit.
Eller and Johnson do not estimate an estate tax ”gap,” but report that as a result of audit, net
estate tax liability increased by $559.8 million, which is 8.7% of the total reported tax liability of
the returns that were audited. Of audited cases, 60.0 percent were closed with additional estate
tax owed, 19.0 percent were closed with no change in assessment, and 21.0 percent were closed
with a reduction in the original net estate tax liability. Erard (1999) estimates the tax gap to
be 13% of potential revenues. Neither Eller and Johnson nor anyone else has tried to estimate
the responsiveness of estate tax evasion to changes in either the tax structure nor to the level of
14 Another

difference is that Wolff uses a re-weighted version of SCF dataset that generates a larger wealth holdings

than the public-use weights used by Poterba.

12

enforcement resources and their application.
The closest antecedent to what we attempt in this paper is Chapman, Hariharan and Southwick
(1996), who regress the logarithm of real revenues from the estate tax in 1958 through 1994 against
the logarithm of real GNP and the logarithm of the marginal estate tax on an estate of real value
equal to $1,400,000 in 1989. The response of revenues should reflect both avoidance and, with a lag,
wealth accumulation. They estimate a significant negative coefficient on the tax rate variable, with
an elasticity of revenues with respect to the marginal tax rate of about -2. They note, however,
that three other definitions of the marginal tax rate ”did not give as strong an effect,” made no
attempt to control for other influences on revenues other than the level of GNP, and included
no time trend, which might be especially important given that the measure of marginal tax rate
increases monotonically over this period. In the empirical analysis that follows, we examine a longer
time period over which the estate tax structure rises and falls, and allow for non-tax influences on
reported estates as well as a time trend. Furthermore, we examine reported estates rather than
revenues in order to separate out the behavioral effects of changes in the tax structure from the
direct revenue impact of such changes.
In summary, although the existing literature has addressed aspects of the behavioral response
to the estate tax, there is not much solid empirical research to inform policy. To be sure, as we
elaborate on below, there are substantial methodological challenges to overcome in obtaining such
evidence.

4.1

Analysis of Aggregate Time-Series Evidence
Motivation and Methodology

Although the technology of life and death means that panel data is (and will in the foreseeable
future be) unavailable, it is still possible to investigate the impact on behavior of the changes over
time in the rates and rules regarding the estate tax. Since its introduction in the Revenue Act
of 1916, there have been many changes in the rate structure, base, deductions, treatment of gifts,
creditability of state estate and inheritance taxes, and other aspects of the tax. In what follows we
make use of some aspects of that variation to examine the impact of the estate tax on aggregate

13

wealth accumulation and avoidance.
The ultimate goal of the empirical analysis is to provide evidence of how the estate tax structure
has affected wealth accumulation and avoidance. Of course, the counterfactual—what estates
would have been under a different tax structure—is not known. We are forced to rely on inference
based on the relationship between what is observed—reported estates of the very wealthy—and
some other variables. For example, one might examine the ratio of estates subject to the estate
tax to the total of all estates, under the assumption that, were it not for the estate tax, this ratio
would stay fairly constant. Alas, the amount of total estates is not known, because we do not
observe the estates of the vast majority of the population that is not subject to estate taxation.
There is, however, information about the aggregate net worth of the whole population. If the
relationship between aggregate net worth and total estates of decedents remains fairly constant
over time, one can use net worth as a benchmark against which to examine the response of taxable
estates to changes in the tax structure. We pursue this strategy in what follows. Studying this
relationship qualitatively is in the spirit of the work of Feenberg and Poterba (1993), who in an
influential article calculated the share of total taxable income received by the top 0.5% of income
earners, and discussed the extent to which it could be explained by the variation in the income tax
rates on this group relative to the population as a whole.
The dependent variable we seek to explain is the ratio (to aggregate net worth) of total reported
net estates (gross estate minus debts) of a fixed percentile of the largest estates. To avoid spurious
results due to changes over time in mortality experience (which would affect the total estates of a
given fraction of the wealthiest taxpayers in a mechanical way), we normalize this variable by the
mortality rate. The variable we construct is defined as
estratiot ≡

Et
,
0.005mt Wt

(25)

where Et is the value in year t of estates of the richest 0.5% of decedents, Wt is aggregate net
worth, and mt is the mortality rate. Noting that 0.005mt is just the ratio of the number of deaths
in the top 0.5% to the total population, estratiot may alternatively be expressed as

Et
,
Wt

where E t

is the average estate of the wealthy decedent group and W is the average wealth among the whole
economy.
It is important to be clear that in what follows we are examining the determinants of reported
14

net worth on estates rather than reported taxable estates. Analyzing the latter raises a difficult
empirical problem because the definition of taxable estate changed several times over the period we
study, and we do not have sufficient data to construct a series according to a consistent definition.
Not adjusting the data causes problems of interpretation, discussed in the context of taxable income
in Slemrod (1998). Over this period, the definition of gross estate and net worth was more stable,
although there were certainly changes, regarding for example inclusion of the property owned jointly
by a married couple, which we attempt to account for in our analysis. Thus, our analysis focuses
on the association between the tax structure and gross estate or net worth, rather than taxable
estate. This compromise due to data constraints almost certainly leads to an understatement of
the true elasticity of the tax base. The data sources and estimation procedure are described in
detail in the appendix.
In order to investigate whether taxes had a significant impact on reported estates, we need
a measure of the tax rate that is not in any way endogenously determined by the distribution
of actual estates. We explore three such measures. The first is the statutory marginal tax rate
that applies to the largest estates (TTOP). Clearly, no decisions of the taxpayers affect this value
instantaneously. Although one could argue that over time the concentration of estates may, through
the political process, influence the tax structure, we ignore this possibility. The other two measures
of the tax rate we investigate are the marginal tax rate at 100 times (T100) and 40 times (T40)
the level of aggregate wealth per capita. The tax rate at 40 times average wealth is of interest
because it corresponds to a sequence of wealth that was subject to the estate tax throughout the
whole period, and yet only very recently did the highest tax bracket apply to it.

4.2

Results

Figures 3 through 5 plot estratio against each of the three tax rate indicators. The tax rate
measures are shown for each year, although estratio is only available (here and in the regression
analysis that follows) for selected years. For both T100 and T40, there is an apparent and striking
negative relationship between the tax variable and the estate/wealth ratio—the two series are
practically mirror images of each other. Indeed, the simple correlations are −0.87 and −0.86 for
T100 and T40, respectively. The sharp increase in the estate tax rates beginning in the early

15

1930’s coincides with a sharp decrease in reported estates, and the halt and, in the case of T100,
decline of the rates beginning in the early 1980’s coincides with the timing of a turnaround in the
estate ratio. For TTOP, the negative relationship is not quite as striking, but there is nevertheless
a correlation of −0.49 between the two series.15
A few features of the tax rate series are worth pointing out. Increases in T100 and T40 between
1942 and 1976 are solely due to “bracket creep” — the nominal tax brackets remained unchanged
while the average wealth was increasing (both in real terms and due to inflation). In the 1980’s, the
T100 series was equal to TTOP,16 and both series stabilized with the aggregate estates. The T40
series, however, paints a different picture. Although the highest tax rates decreased in the early
1980s, this is not true for the tax rates that applied at this more moderate level of wealth. Instead,
the marginal tax rate continued to increase due to both real and nominal changes in aggregate
wealth. Legislated increases in the exemption level were just too small to matter.
The strong negative correlation between estratio and the tax rate measures does not establish
that the changes in the estate tax caused the changes in reported estates. For one thing, there may
have been other factors influencing this variable that are coincidentally related to the evolution of
the estate tax. For instance, the correlation of estratio with the real S&P 500 index is −0.59. We
can, of course, go beyond ocular econometrics and investigate formally the relationship between
the estate/wealth ratio and the estate tax structure in a regression framework, in a way similar
to Slemrod’s (1996) investigation of the determinants of the Feenberg-Poterba high-income share
of total income. The multiple regression framework allows us to statistically hold constant non-tax
factors that changed over time that might be expected to influence this variable.
We investigate two non-tax and two tax but non-estate-tax explanatory variables. The first
non-tax variable is the contemporaneous inflation-adjusted level of the S&P 500 stock market
index. This is included because changes in asset values will affect the value of estates in a way
that cannot be offset by changed behavior. On the reasonable assumption that the portfolio of
15 Note

that not correcting for mortality rate would make it even more striking, because the mortality was de-

creasing over time and thus without this correction the additional downward-sloping time pattern would be present
in the estate series.
16 The increase in T100 in 1996 is due to a phase-out of the exemption and lower tax rates at smaller estates that
increases the marginal tax rate on estates between $10 and $21.4 million to 60%.

16

high-wealth individuals is likely to be relatively more concentrated in stocks, we expect to find a
positive relationship between the stock market index and estratio, a relationship that is unrelated
to a behavioral response to taxation. We also include a ten-year lagged value of the inequality
of income, measured as the share of income going to the richest 5% of the population (see the
appendix for the source of this series). This variable is meant to proxy for the inequality of lifetime
endowments which, other things equal, would later cause inequality in estates. Of course, income
realizations depend not only on endowments, but also on factors such as labor supply and effort,
which may have themselves been affected by the estate tax structure, and therefore the income
inequality measure may be endogenous. This problem is somewhat alleviated by using the lagged
value of the inequality measure.
To control for the possible effects of other tax variables, we also include as explanatory variables
the indiviudal income tax and, separately, the corporation income tax rates that applied to the
highest bracket of individual and corporation income, respectively. Both of these variables were
lagged ten years to account for the fact that they were more likely to be important during the
individual’s working years.
The regression results are presented in Table 1. The dependent variable is the logarithm of
estratio. In the basic specification, shown in the first three columns, the right-hand-side variables
include a constant, the log of one of the three measures of the net-of-tax rate (1 − t), the inflationadjusted stock market index, the income inequality measure, and the two lagged tax rate terms.
The coefficients of the (net of) estate tax rate variables are in all cases positive and are in all
but one case significant at the 1% level, suggesting that an increase in taxes is indeed associated
with reduced reported estates relative to aggregate wealth. As expected, the stock market variable
has a positive association with the estate variable, with an estimated coefficient between 0.23 and
0.31. The coefficient on lagged income inequality is also positive but not significantly different
than zero.
Both the lagged individual and corporate income tax rates are significantly related to estratio,
but not necessarily in an expected way. Higher income tax rates are associated with an increase
of the ratio of reported estates to aggregate wealth, while higher corporation income tax rates are
associated with a decrease. The former result is not consistent with the idea that high income

17

tax rates depress both labor and saving, causing lower wealth accumulation. The pair of results
is, though, consistent with the idea, explored in Gordon and Slemrod (2000), that high individual
income tax rates cause income to be retained by corporations rather than being paid out to
business principals. If, due perhaps to liquidity constraints, the shifting toward the corporate tax
base reduces the propensity to consume, this could produce the pattern of associations with tax
rates displayed in Table 1.
Given that the key series appear to be trending, it is not surprising that the fit of these
regressions is very good. The reported Durbin-Watson statistics are, however, low, reflecting
significant positive autocorrelation. The presence of missing data makes it impossible to address the
problem of autocorrelation using standard approaches, as it would require deleting all of the isolated
observations. However, the observed autocorrelation may be simply caused by misspecification of
the model, and when we control below for other relevant factors the problem is mitigated.
Our measure of the magnitude of the top estates is normalized by the aggregate wealth and
the death rate. Implicitly, this procedure amounts to restricting the coefficients on wealth and the
death rate in a regression explaining total estates to be equal to one. However, either of these
variables may have an independent effect on the largest estates. For example, it may be that the
inequality of wealth is systematically related to the level of development. Furthermore, during the
20th century, there were significant trends in the mortality rate and the expected length of life.
These factors may affect the size distribution of estates by affecting the age structure of decedents
and their lifetime behavior. The death rate may be used as a proxy for these considerations.
The next three columns of Table 1 augment the original specification by adding as explanatory
variables the level of aggregate wealth, the death rate, and a time trend. The coefficients on the
tax rate variables remain significant in two out of three cases, although they are somewhat smaller.
The coefficient on the S&P 500 index increases, while the coefficient on lagged income inequality
becomes negative and significant in two out of three cases. We find that there is a negative time
trend. Both aggregate wealth and the death rate enter significantly and negatively. The coefficients
on the aggregate wealth are between −0.62 and −0.81, suggesting that 1% increase in aggregate
wealth is associated with only between a 0.18% and 0.39% increase in the wealth of the rich. It
should be pointed out, however, that the relative wealth of the rich is also affected by changes in

18

the stock market, which are undoubtedly causally related to aggregate wealth. This introduces a
qualification to the interpretation of the estimated coefficient on wealth.17
The estimated coefficients on the measures of the net-of-tax rate are between 0.083 and 0.335.
In the logarithmic specification, these coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. However, one
has to be careful in interpreting these coefficients as elasticities with respect to the tax rate, because
one cannot adequately characterize the whole tax system by means of a single rate, and even if
it were possible it is not clear how exactly our measures are related to it. Still, these estimates
are suggestive in assigning to the estate tax a moderate but statistically significant role in the
determination of aggregate reported estates of wealthy Americans.18

4.3

Caveats to Interpreting the Aggregate Analysis

Although the aggregate results are consistent with the notion that the estate tax causes lower
reported estates, a number of caveats to this conclusion are in order. First of all, it may be that
the rates themselves responded to aspects of economic performance. Certainly the largest increase
in rates occurred at the beginning of the Great Depression. This may have reflected the view
that in a period of widespread destitution a highly progressive tax on wealth is more defensible.
Notably, the drop in the estate/wealth ratio occurred before the estate tax increase began.
We also acknowlege that our summary measures of the marginal estate tax rate do not account
for many relevant features of the estate and gift system. For example, the treatment of gifts
changed dramatically over the period, leading to the present “unified” treatment of estates and
gifts beginning in 1981. The treatment of state-level inheritance, estate, and gift taxes also changed
dramatically, such that at first they were incremental taxes and by the end of the period they were
largely creditable, and therefore not incremental. These and certain other aspects of the U.S. tax
system are not captured in this analysis. Undoubtedly, this imprecision adds measurement error
17 It

is also worth noting that, because wealth is in the denominator of the dependent variable, errors in measuring

it will introduce a negative bias to the estimated coefficients.
18 We also investigated a number of other modifications of this specification, such as including lagged values of the
S&P 500 index, adding dummies for years when the unlimited marital deduction was in effect, and for the World
War II period. The qualitative results are robust to these changes. We also investigated adding a lagged value of
the tax variable. Usually it was insignificant, and the coefficient on the contemporaneous value was not qualitatively
affected.

19

to the tax variables that will tend to bias the estimated tax coefficients toward zero. Moreover, if
the mismeasurement is systematically related to the included independent variables, it could lead
to bias of any direction in the estimated coefficients. We leave refinement of these summary tax
measures to future research.
A more technical issue concerns what has been labeled ”rank reversals.” This refers to the
possibility that in periods when taxes are high, the high estate group we are focusing on is no
longer composed of the wealthiest individuals, but rather the relatively poor avoiders, or those who
are unwilling to cut back on wealth accumulation. This phenomenon implies that the composition
of this group changes systematically with tax changes. Note, though, that the direction of the bias
is to find less response of reported estates to tax changes, because we would underestimate the
true decrease in estates due to an increase in taxes.
Because the decision to accumulate or spend wealth is usually made in the context of a family,
it is conceivable that people with differing marital status may react differently to the tax rates. For
example, a couple may react differently to features of the estate tax that affect marital bequests (on
the estate of the first spouse dying) than to taxes on estates of the second spouse. Such issues may
not be adequately analyzed with aggregate data, if the cross-sectional composition of families has
changed over the sample period. Furthermore, as mentioned above, a varying amount of spousal
bequests, changing in part because of the variation in the relevant tax incentives, may influence
the extent to which wealth accumulation appears twice in the estate tax return data.
Finally, any analysis of annual aggregate data relies on a small number of tax changes and observations, so that definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. We stress that the results are consistent
with a behavioral response to estate tax rates, but do not decisively establish such a relationship.

Analysis of Pooled Estate Tax Return Data
The Promise of Micro Analysis

Examining data from estate tax returns that is aggregated by years may obscure the relationship
between the tax system on the one hand, and wealth accumulation and tax avoidance behavior on
the other. To take a simple example, in a year when the tax law changed it does not allow us to

20

differentiate the estates reported in the two different tax regimes.19 More importantly, aggregate
analysis precludes examining whether the impact of the tax system is moderated by individualspecific attributes, such as age at death or the presence of a surviving spouse.
In this section we examine the data from individual estate tax returns, with the goal of identifying the tax and non-tax determinants of taxable estates. At first blush, one might expect that
the greatest advantage of analyzing individual tax return data lies in the ability to calculate tax
rates on a return-by-return basis, rather than having to use summary statistics that characterize
the tax system in place but that do not vary by individual. However, the econometric analysis of
taxation using micro-level estate tax return data is plagued by the ubiquitous problem that, in a
graduated tax system like that of the U.S., the marginal tax rate is a function (only) of the taxable
estate. This raises the danger of detecting a positive correlation between the level of the estate and
the marginal tax rate that is unrelated to any causal relationship between tax rates and behavior.
This may obscure a causal negative relationship between the tax rate and reported estates. We
return to this issue below.
As our foundation, we appeal to the model of Section 2.3 in which the only uncertainty is
about longevity, and annuities are not available. In this case, wealth at death is a function of the
present value of the endowment (including the ability to earn net-of-tax income and any inheritance
received), the after-tax rate of return to saving, age at death, the individual’s tastes regarding labor
versus leisure, regarding bequests versus own consumption and present versus future consumption
(the discount rate), and the estate tax structure. In what follows we first outline our empirical
strategy for examining the impact of estate taxation on wealth accumulation and avoidance, and
then discuss the observable proxies for the marginal tax rate and other factors that influence the
estate.
Our data come from estate tax returns collected by the IRS from 1916 until 1996. The dataset,
which was also the source of the aggregate analysis of Section 4, is described in detail in the
appendix. It contains information on almost 770,000 decedents. The filing threshold and, consequently, the coverage of the estate tax varied over the years, so that the composition of population
19 In

the aggregate analysis we account for this problem by taking as a measure of the tax rate in a given year a

weighted average of the relevant tax rates (with weights proportional to the time they were in effect).

21

subject to the tax in different years changed. Given that time series variation is an important
source of identification, the varying coverage could lead to spurious conclusions. For that reason,
we construct a more homogenous sample by analyzing, as in the aggregate analysis, the estates of
the richest 0.5% of U.S. decedents in each year. This procedure ensures that every observation for
every year of death represented in the data corresponds to an estate well above the filing threshold.
This limits the sample to slightly more than 310,000 decedents.

5.2
5.2.1

Calculating the Individual-Specific Marginal Tax Rate
Calculating the Marginal Tax Rate

The key explanatory variable is the marginal estate tax rate applicable to an individual. It is
a component of the “price” of leaving a bequest relative to lifetime consumption and relative to
leisure, as well as being the reward to reducing via avoidance the taxable estate by one dollar.
The marginal tax rate is not present explicitly on the tax return. We construct it by applying
the actual tax schedule in effect at the time of death of the indvidual to a measure of the taxable
estate. Details of this procedure may be found in the appendix.
We also investigate two measures of the marginal tax rate that might be expected during the
lifetime of an individual: the tax rate at age of 45 (RATE45)20 and the tax rate 10 years before
death (RATE10). Both are evaluated at the actual taxable estate at death, denominated in dollars
of the relevant year, but using the tax rate schedule in effect in these earlier years. Investigating
these tax rate measures may also prove helpful in two other ways. First, if one believes that
avoidance measures, as distinct from labor supply or consumption decisions, are decided late
in life, then the response to the tax rates expected earlier in life may separately identify the
wealth accumulation behavioral response. Second, these variables are much less susceptible to the
possibility that they are, via a political reaction, endogenous to the economic situation.

5.2.2

The Marginal Tax Rate for Married Couples

In defining the marginal tax rate that affected wealth accumulation and avoidance decisions, an
important issue is the treatment of spousal bequests. To see the issues involved, recall that the 1981
20 For

individuals who died before reaching age 45, we assume that RATE45 is equal to RATE.

22

Economic Recovery Tax Act provided for an unlimited deduction for bequests to surviving spouses.
Under previous law (going back to 1948) the deduction for spousal bequests was limited to one-half
of the adjusted gross estate. (From 1977 to 1981 the deduction was the greater of $250,000 and
one-half of the adjusted gross estate). Under these two regimes, what is the appropriate marginal
tax rate on a given taxable estate for a decedent with a surviving spouse?
One possible approach to this question is to calculate the marginal tax rate for a constant
spousal bequest. Comparing two returns with the same gross estate, this procedure assigns a
marginal tax rate of zero to a return with a sufficiently large spousal bequest deduction, and assigns
a positive tax rate to the one with no spousal bequest deduction. In the context of estimating
the impact of the estate tax on charitable bequests, Joulfaian (1998a) argues that the unlimited
marital deduction helps to alleviate the problem of separating the wealth effect and the marginal
tax rate effect; because estates vary greatly in the amount of spousal deduction, Joulfain argues
that this provides a source of variation in the effective tax rate for a given level of wealth. But
this procedure provides identification only under the assumption that the behavior under study, in
his case charitable contributions, does not independently depend on whether there is a surviving
spouse.
For estimating the tax disincentive effect on wealth acumulation, calculating the marginal tax
rate ignoring the eventual taxation of the surviving spouse’s estate is almost certainly inappropriate. In a model where the couple cares only about the total net-of-tax bequest, even if there
is no tax levied upon the first decedent because all the estate is left to the surviving spouse, the
effective tax rate is that of the last dying spouse. Because we cannot link estate tax returns from
the same family, we are unable to measure that precisely. However, the size of the spousal bequest
reveals some information about this, because this bequest becomes the inheritance of the surviving
spouse, whose eventual estate equals that inheritance, plus any assets held separately at the time
of the first spouse’s death, plus subsequent earnings, minus consumption.
Furthermore, note that the household that cares only about the total net-of-tax bequest should
equate the expected marginal tax rate levied on the two estates, and will not do so only to the
extent there are costs associated which it, such as, e.g, liquidity constraints that may be faced by
small business owners. If such non-tax costs apply to the first spouse only, the relevant marginal

23

cost of taxation is approximated by the rate faced by the second spouse, which is equal to the
marginal tax rate of the first spouse plus the unobservable marginal cost.
This discussion suggests that the relevant marginal tax rate that would be expected to affect
wealth accumulation decisions is not necessarily well measured by the observed marginal tax rate
of one member of a married couple. Furthermore, the appropriate marginal tax rate depends on
a number of unverifiable aspects of family decision making. Faced with this indeterminacy, we
investigate two different measures of the appropriate marginal tax rate. The basic one (denoted
RATE) is simply the marginal tax rate that applies to the decedent’s taxable estate at death
assuming a fixed spousal bequest. Note that after 1981 this procedure assigns a tax rate of zero
to a large estate that was entirely left to the surviving spouse. The other tax rate measure,
RATEMAX, addresses the issues discussed concerning the treatment of married couples. It is the
maximum of RATE and RATESP, where RATESP is equal for married decedents to the marginal
tax rate calculated using the bequest to the spouse as the tax base, and is equal to RATE for
unmarried individuals. This procedure attempts to implement the idea that the tax distortion
faced by the household may be better measured by the tax paid by the second spouse.

5.2.3

Instrumenting for the Marginal Tax Rate

As already discussed, a critical methodological challenge is to identify an individual-specific marginal
tax rate that is not a function of the estate itself. When studying behavior that is a component
of or a deduction from the tax base, such as charitable contributions, this problem has been dealt
with by assuming that the other components of the tax base are exogenous (although see, in the
context of capital gains realizations, Burman and Randolph 1992), and using the marginal tax rate
at zero (or, an average for similar returns) amount of contributions. This “first-dollar” marginal
tax rate does not depend on the magnitude of the studied behavior, and is thus exogenous. Because
it is not the actual applicable “last-dollar” marginal tax rate, a common empirical strategy is to
use the first-dollar marginal tax rate as an instrumental variable for the appropriate last-dollar
marginal tax rate.
This approach is much more problematic when the behavior under study is a principal component or, as in this case, is identical to, the tax base. Thus, the literature on the elasticity of

24

taxable income (Slemrod 1998) has focused on longitudinal data that bracket changes in the tax
schedule. In this way, comparing data over time allows one to look at the behavior at given levels
of income but at different marginal tax rates.
Alas, the nature of the estate tax is such that one will never observe the same person paying
estate tax under two (or more!) estate tax regimes. In cross-sectional or pooled cross-sectional
data, simply regressing the estate value against the marginal estate tax rate will surely produce
a bias toward finding a spurious positive relationship, due to the graduated nature of the tax.
Consequently, we seek instruments that are correlated with the tax rate, but do not affect independently the estates of taxpayers. In what follows we will use the three tax system measures
discussed in Section 4 — TTOP, T100 and T40 — as instruments for the actual marginal tax rate.
These instruments vary only across years, and not across individuals in a given year. Thus, using
only these instruments would not make use of any cross-sectional variation in identifying the effect
of marginal tax rates. This would still be an improvement over the aggregate analysis, however,
because we can control for the potentially changing cross-sectional composition of the decedent
population, and for potential differential response to taxes.
We can, though, improve upon this approach. In order to make use of the cross-sectional
variation, we note that decisions affecting the estate at death are made over the whole lifetime.
Consequently, the marginal tax rate should be correlated with characteristics of the tax system in
the years preceding death. This adds to our arsenal of potential instruments lagged values of the
three measures of the tax (we use ten years lagged values of these variables). More interestingly, it
also allows us to construct a set of instruments that vary within a year: the three measures of the
tax system in effect when the decedent was 45. The tax rate at age 45 is chosen to represent the
tax rate when individuals begin to consider the ramifications of the estate tax. These instruments
vary with age and the year of death of an individual, allowing for a richer source of identification.
Furthermore, we include instruments accounting for changes in the taxation of spousal bequests:
dummies for married and widowed individuals dying when a limited marital deduction was allowed
(1948-1981) and dummies for married and widowed individuals dying when an unlimited marital
deduction was allowed (post-1981).

25

5.3

Non-tax Independent Variables

The estate tax return data contain a number of other variables which might reasonably be expected
to affect the estate.21 By statistically controlling for these variables, we can presumably sharpen
the estimate of the partial effect of taxation on the reported estate. Potentially more importantly,
there are several variables which would be expected to moderate the effect of taxation. For example,
our theoretical model suggests that the effect of taxes on the estate would depend on age at death.
Furthermore, the wealth accumulation of married individuals may differ from the patterns of wealth
accumulation among single individuals for reasons unrelated to the tax rates. For example, the
effect of uncertainty for a couple will usually be different than the sum of effects for two separate
individuals (Hurd 1994). Finally, reported estates may behave in a systematically different way
in community property states, in which most family wealth is determined to be jointly owned by
both spouses; we include a dummy variable for residence in a community property state.22
By including in the regression interaction terms between the tax rates and these other moderating variables, we can enrich our analysis in an important dimension. This is because now in
high-tax periods we would expect not only an effect on the level of reported estates, but also an
effect on the relative reported estates of decedents with different characteristics. For example, we
would expect that in high-tax periods, the reported estates of young decedents would be relatively
higher, because the estate tax had not have a chance to affect many years of wealth accumulation
decisions.
In order to analyze differential effects by demographic groups, we interact the marginal tax rate
with a dummy for being married, sex, age and testate status. Of course, each of these variables
interacted with the tax rate is endogenous to the size of the estate, for the same reasons discussed
earlier.

states were community property states for the whole period considered: Arizona, California, Idaho,

Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Washington. In 1986 the Uniform Marital Property Act, which approximates community property statutes, was introduced in Wisconsin.

5.4.1

Results of Micro Regression Analyses
The Basic Regression Framework

We begin by estimating specifications that are similar to the aggregate ones whose results are
reported in Table 1. Table 2 contains the results of a regression of the logarithm of real net worth
reported on the estate tax return on the log of the net-of-tax rate (denoted RATE), controlling
only for the (economy-wide) variables used in the aggregate analysis. The first column presents
the results when the three aggregate tax measures are used as instruments. The coefficient on the
net-of-tax rate is equal to −0.05, and is not significantly different from zero.23
The next three columns of Table 2 contain the results of using as the sole instrument one
of the three summary measures of the tax rate structure. This specification improves upon the
aggregate analysis only by making use of the actual individual tax rates, which allows for an
easier interpretation of the estimated coefficient. The estimated elasticities for two of the three
instruments are positive, although quite different from the coefficients in the aggregate analysis.
However, when T40 (the tax at 40 times the average wealth) is used, the estimated elasticity is
negative and significant. One possibility for this anomalous result is that, although asymptotically
any instrument will do, the finite sample performance of different instruments may vary. In fact,
although the sample contains more than 300,000 individuals, all of the instruments and the righthand side variables are constant within a year, so that this procedure is equivalent to regressing
the average logarithm of net worth within the year on the yearly average of the net-of-tax rate and
the other explanatory variables. Viewed in this way, there are only as many degrees of freedom as
there are years in the sample (49, to be precise), and so finite sample bias may be significant.
A more intriguing explanation has to do with the composition of the sample. By construction,
T40 should be most closely related to the marginal tax rates at relatively small estates, while
the other two measures should be more correlated with the marginal tax rates at higher estates.
If there are systematic differences in how high-wealth and very high-wealth individuals respond
to the estate tax (e.g., if the marital status or gender composition of the two groups differ, and
23 We

report standard IV errors. Potentially, they may be understated if there is signficant within-year correlation

in the error terms. This problem is somewhat alleviated due to inclusion of the time trend and other time-dependent
aggregate variables.

27

the response to the tax varies systematically with these demographic characteristics), different
instruments may pick up the response of different groups. Consequently, this result may simply
reflect the heterogeneity of response within the sample.

5.4.2

Introducing Individual-Specific Non-Tax Controls

Next we introduce into the micro regressions certain known characteristics of the decedents: marital status, sex, testate status, plus age and age squared, and dummy variables for residing in a
community property state when married or widowed.24 In addition, we include the set of variables from Table 2 and the values of the S&P 500 index lagged by 5 years, 10 years and at the
time the decedent was 45.25 This last variable is of particular interest, because it may help to
control for any cohort effect and to disentangle cohort and age effects. A similar approach is taken
in Kapteyn, Alessie and Lusardi (1999) in their study of the effect of Social Security programs on
saving. They consider different indicators of economic conditions during the economic life of an individual: GNP per capita when the household entered the labor market (proxying for productivity
changes), as well as changes in the social security system. Although these factors may be relevant
for the general public, they are probably of less importance for the very rich group that we are
studying. For this segment of population, the performance of financial markets is probably of more
relevance. In addition, the level of the stock market index helps to control for the endowment of
different cohorts. It is also undoubtedly affected by productivity shocks, so that this aspect is not
completely absent from our analysis.26
Table 3 shows the results of the regression specifications in which the only measure of the tax
burden is the marginal tax rate at the time of death. For comparison with aggregate regressions,
the first column presents the results when only the three tax measures are used as the instruments.
The next two specifications extend the set of instruments, first by adding the lagged and at age 45
24 Because

most demographic information is unavailable before 1925, these results (and those of the later tables)

are based on returns of decedents in 1925 and thereafter.
25 Although not reported in the tables, we also controlled separately for a dummy indicating the imputation of age,
(equal zero if not imputed), imputed age squared, and the S&P 500 at age of 45 multiplied by the age imputation
dummy. The results are robust to limiting the sample to just individuals for whom the age at death is known.
26 We do not include the level of GNP in our analysis, because there is no consistent annual series going back to
the 19th century, when the economic life of many individuals in our sample began.

28

tax measures, and then by additionally including the marital deduction dummies. The estimated
elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate is between −0.11 and 0.09. It is negative and significant
when smaller sets of instruments are used, and becomes positive when the full set of instruments is
used. We conclude that the estimated relationship between the reported estate and the marginal
estate tax rate is quite fragile to the set of instruments used to try to disentangle the behavioral
response from the mechanical positive relationship between the size of the estate and the marginal
tax rate that arises due to graduated nature of the tax system.
The estimated values on the other coefficients are of separate interest. The estimated coefficients
on age and age squared correspond to an increasing wealth profile with people who are 70 years old
having approximately 4.7% higher net worth than those who are 50. This pattern is consistent with
some other empirical evidence (e.g., Hurd 1987). Most of the other variables enter significantly as
well. Estimated values of the marital status coefficients27 suggest that being divorced is associated
with a relatively higher level of net worth on the estate, while being single is on average accompanied
by lower net worth, when compared to other types of marital status. Being a male is associated
with slightly higher reported net worth. Testate status has the strongest effect in explaining net
worth of all the dummy variables. People who die with a will have a net worth that is on average
27% higher than of those who die intestate. This is consistent with the idea that the presence of a
will is a good indicator of having a bequest motive. It is also plausible that having a will is more
attractive when the estate tax is higher, and so is an endogenous variable.
The S&P 500 index at the age of 45 enters significantly and with the expected positive sign.
The estimated elasticity is, however, rather small. The elasticity with respect to the current level
of the S&P 500 index is estimated to be about 0.25, not too far from the effect estimated earlier.
Surprisingly, lagged values of the S&P 500 index enter negatively. It is possible that this reflects
tax avoidance. The higher is net worth, the more important estate tax planning becomes, because
higher estate tax rates may potentially apply to it. Shocks to net worth (e.g., due to a booming
stock market) may then induce an avoidance response and result in lower observed net worth a
few years later.
The logarithm of the death rate is not significantly related to net worth reported on estate

tax returns. Aggregate wealth may control for the unobservable endowment, in which case the
positive coefficient is not surprising. The estimated negative effect of lagged income inequality is
unexpected, although it is consistent with some of the aggregate results. The estimated effects of
the lagged income tax rate variables are consistent with the aggregate results.

5.4.3

Allowing for Heterogeneity in the Response to Taxation

Table 4 presents the results of specifications that allow for differential response to the estate tax
for different groups of taxpayers. The first specification reveals no differential response by sex.
The next three specifications, which test for differential response by marital status, testate status,
and age, are all of interest.
As mentioned earlier, the response of married couples may differ from the response of single
individuals. This can occur because the expected longevity of a family (understood as the survival
of one of the spouses) is higher than that of an individual. Consequently, the probability of a
family paying the tax in any given period is smaller, and therefore the shape of its consumption
profile is less affected. A family may also respond to the tax by modifying the timing of its taxable
estates. Higher tax rates are usually associated with more progressive rate structures, and thus
introduce a stronger motive to equate the expected marginal tax rate (and therefore the estate)
of both spouses. The second specification in Table 4, which allows for a differential response by
marital status, suggests that the married individuals (i.e., these with a surviving spouse) respond
to a lower net-of-tax rate by increasing their net worth (with an elasticity of −0.078), while the
effect for single individuals is insignificant. This may be explained by the hypothesis of equalization
of the marginal tax rates if, absent the tax, the report of the first spouse would be smaller than
that of the second. Then, the tax rate of the first spouse, ceteris paribus, is negatively correlated
with the tax rate of the second spouse. If so, the estimated negative coefficient for the married
individuals may be consistent with reduction of the family’s net worth in response to taxes.
Theory indicates clearly that the response of the estate to the tax rate is greater the larger the
time one has to adjust to the tax rate. This may be crudely captured by interacting the marginal
tax rate with age. Such a regression is presented in the third specification of Table 4. As expected,
the tax effect is increasing with age.

30

Finally, in the last column of Table 4 we report the results of interacting testate status with
the net-of-tax rate. If, as is highly plausible, having a will is an indication of a bequest motive,
one would expect that wealth accumulation would be more sensitive to taxation for those who die
with a will. The results strongly confirm this expectation, although as noted earlier this conclusion
must be tempered by the possible endogeneity of testate status.

5.4.4

Alternative Measures of the Effective Tax Rate

The marginal estate tax rate variable we have analyzed up to this point is evaluated at the time
of death. However, the bulk of the behavioral response to estate taxation undoubtedly takes place
in the years preceding death, perhaps throughout the whole economic life of an individual. Thus,
arguably it is the tax structure in place during the life of an individual that affects the expectations
about the actual tax at death and shapes the response. We investigate two measures of the tax
rate expected earlier in life: the tax rate 10 years before death (RATE10) and at the age of 45
(RATE45). Both are calculated by applying the relevant tax structure to the actual taxable estate
at death denominated in dollars of the corresponding year. Table 5 shows the results. Each of these
net-of-tax variables has a positive and significant impact on the reported estate. Furthermore, in
results not reported here, in a “horserace” between either of these variables and the basic rate,
the alternative measure robs the basic tax rate of its significance and has a significant positive
coefficient. These results are consistent with the idea that most of the behavioral response takes
place over a long horizon, and suggests that future research should focus on such measures of the
tax incentives.
The last variable we investigated is RATEMAX, equal to the maximum of the own and an
estimated spousal tax rate for married individuals, and equal to the decedent’s own marginal tax
rate for unmarried individuals.28 The estimated coefficient is significantly negative. This finding
may simply reflect the impact on the timing of spousal bequests discussed earlier, or may indicate
that RATEMAX does not successfully measure the expected effective tax rate of a married couple.
For example, holding other things constant, the spousal bequest will be higher the lower is the

31

marginal tax rate faced by the spouse. Consequently, the estimated negative value may be spurious.
Understanding the effect of the estate tax on spousal bequests, and how empirical investigation
might account for this, should be high on the agenda for future research.

Conclusions

This paper represents a first attempt to learn from an extraordinary archive for estate tax return
data. In the end we have, as first attempts usually do, raised as many questions as we have
provided answers. We began with an aggregate time-series analysis, and found that summary
measures of the estate tax rate structure are generally negatively correlated with the reported
net worth of the top estates relative to national wealth. This conclusion is preserved when we
control for other relevant influences in a multiple regression framework. This finding is consistent
with estate taxation reducing either wealth accumulation or inducing avoidance, or both. We view
this evidence as suggestive rather than definitive, because of the difficulty of controlling for other
factors and of ascribing causality to an observed association.
We then turned to an analysis of the individual tax return data. We make use of both the timeseries variation in the tax rate structure, and the cross-sectional variation in observable individual
characteristics. In particular, cross-sectional differences in age provide a potentially important
source of identification because they correspond to differences in the tax structure effective during
one’s lifetime.
In our baseline specification the estimated elasticity of reported estates is positive (i.e., negative
with respect to the tax rate itself) and statistically significant. The response is also clearly positive
for those who die testate and are older, which suggests that a behavioral response is present for
older people who have a bequest motive.
When we investigate measures of the tax rate that prevailed during one’s lifetime rather than
at death, the estimated negative behavioral response to estate taxes is more pronounced. In
particular, the marginal tax rate at the age of 45 dominates all other measures, and the estimated
elasticity with respect to (one minus) the tax rate is 0.16, and is statistically significant. Such a
number is also economically significant, because it implies that an estate tax rate of 50% would

32

reduce the reported net worth of the richest half percent of the population by 10.5% when its effect
is fully realized many years later.29
Our results do not answer the question of whether the estate tax deserves a role in the U.S. tax
system. They are, though, a first step toward pinning down the magnitude of behavioral response
to the tax, which is a crucial input for determining the optimal level of estate taxes.30 A part of
the measured effect on reported estates is due to reduced wealth accumulation, and another part
is due to estate planning techniques. Only the former has implications for capital accumulation,
although both are indicative of economic cost. Note, though, that to those who believe that a
highly unequal distribution of wealth has negative consequences aside from its implications for
individual levels of well-being, that the estate tax reduces the wealth accumulation of the most
well-off families is an indication of policy success rather than policy failure. However, as discussed
by Kaplow (this volume), that is a controversial notion.

29 The

change in the log of net worth is 0.16ln(1 − .5) ≈ −0.111, which corresponds to a reduction in net worth

by 1 − exp(−0.111) ≈ 10.5%.
30 See Kopczuk (2000) for a theoretical analysis of this question.

A

Aggregate Data

To construct the aggregate estate-wealth ratio, estratio, we first calculate the number of total
decedents in a given year using the mortality rates and the population from U.S. Bureau of the
Census (1975) (for data before 1968) and from the Economic Report of the President (for after
1968). Using this information, we sum the net worth of the number of estates that is equal to
0.5% of total decedents with the highest net worth. After 1945, we use the population weights to
calculate the size of the population represented by a given sample of estates. Between 1962 and
1976, the sample is representative of returns filed in the next year, so that calculated net worth
corresponds to this population. This procedure gives us the total reported estates of the top 0.5%
of decedents, all of whom are subject to the estate taxation over this period.
The denominator of estratio, aggregate economy-wide net worth, is based on a few sources. Up
to and including 1945, it is taken from Goldsmith, Brady and Menderhausen (1956, table W-1),
with minor corrections for some years as in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975, series F422) (the
latter source does not contain the data for all years). After 1945, the data on net worth is taken
from the Federal Reserve balance sheets of the U.S. economy. Both series are calculated at current
cost. The series overlap between 1945 and 1958. They are very close for most of this period,
although there is a discrepancy of approximately 10% for 1945. In calculating average wealth, we
use the total U.S. population.
The series for the Consumer Price Index and the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index are from U.S.
Bureau of the Census (1975) (series E135) and the Economic Report of the President (1999).
The series on income inequality are based on two sources. Up to 1945, we use the share of
income going to the top 5% of the richest individuals, constructed by Simon Kuznets and reprinted
in U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975). After 1945, we use the share of income going to the top 5%
families, constructed by the Bureau of Census (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1996). The values of
the two series are very close in the overlapping year of 1945. We are not aware of any consistent
series for income inequality for the whole period that we consider.
The information on the estate tax structure is obtained from the Internal Revenue Code.31
31 Luckey

(1995) and McCubbin (1990) discuss the history of changes in the taxation of estates.

34

The series for the top tax rate32 and tax rates at the standardized levels of wealth are constructed
based on the actual tax structures. For the years when more than one tax law was in effect, we
use a weighted average of the relevant tax rates under different regimes, with weights proportional
to the time a given tax structure was in place. The Tax Reform Act of 1924 was repealed in 1926,
so that estates of individuals who died between 1924 and 1926 were retroactively subject to the
rates set before 1924. For these years the relevant tax structure is unclear, because repeal of the
law was probably expected for part of this period. Nevertheless, we use the marginal tax rates
that were effective during this period. In calculating the lagged tax rates, tax rate series are set
to zero before 1916, although there were episodes when there was an estate tax, e.g., in the years
1898-1902, when the death tax introduced by the War Revenue Act of 1898 was in effect. However,
we assume that these taxes were expected to last for a short period of time only, so that they did
not have an effect on the lifetime decisions of people who were young at the time.

B

Micro Data

The basic data are drawn from the estate tax returns collected by the IRS. The database contains
data from the Statistics of Income studies for 1916 to 1945, 1962, 1965, 1969, 1972, 1976 and for
each year from 1982 to 1996.33 The pre-war data contains a nearly 100% sample of estate tax
returns for people who died between 1916 and 1945.34 The post-war data are stratified samples of
estate tax returns. Between 1962 and 1976 they are representative of the estates filed in one year
following the nominal date of the study, resulting in a majority of the returns being for decedents
who died in the year of the study. Starting in 1982, they are stratified to be representative of the
population of decedents in a given year. We use the sampling weights in our regression.
32 This

is defined as the marginal tax rate for the largest estate, not the maximum marginal tax rate. Due to the

phase-out of the initial deduction after 1987 the latter is 60%, while the former is 55%.
33 The pre-1945 data are described in McCubbin (1990), and the later data are described in various studies
in Johnson (1994).
34 There is a possibility that some of the returns were missing at the time the data was coded. However, McCubbin
(1990) compared the number of returns present in the sample to the numbers reported by the IRS in its official
publications from this period, and concluded that the coverage is extremely good. In fact, in some years the dataset
contains more returns than the IRS reported.

35

The estate tax return data contain almost all the items on the tax return, but the tax form
changed over the years so that only a subset of variables is present for all observations. With some
exceptions, this subset includes the year of death, debts and mortgages, gross estate, charitable
bequests, sex, marital status, testate status, and the presence of trust and gifts.35 The pre-1945
data contain information on the number of children and the number of beneficiaries. The pre-1945
data and data for 1976 contain the length of the terminal illness. The post-war data additionally
contain information on the size of the taxable estate, bequests to a surviving spouse and any
deduction for such bequests.
We define net worth to be the total gross estate minus debts reported on the tax returns.
Notably, before 1945 data set does not contain information on the estate subject to taxation, a
natural subject of investigation. Although there is information about the total tax liability owed
to the federal government, there is no information about the deductions for taxes already paid,
such as the state estate, inheritance and gift taxes, that were used to arrive at this number, making it impossible to calculate the taxable estate by inverting the tax liability using the actual tax
structure.36 Instead, we construct a measure of taxable income based on other information. As
our measure of taxable estate before 1918, we simply take net worth. In 1918, the deduction for
charitable bequests was introduced. It applies to estates of decedents who died after December 31,
1917, and thus we define taxable estate to be equal to the difference between net worth and charitable contributions.37 This measure ignores other deductions about which we have no information.
The main missing components are deductions for the tax paid on property subject to the estate
tax within previous 5 years and administrative funeral expenses. After 1945, we use the actual
adjusted taxable estate from the tax return. In the years 1962 to 1981 the marital deduction is
35 When

the marital status is missing in the regression analyses, we treat it as a separate category. Age is missing

in 1965 and for some observations in other years.
36 For example, under the Revenue Act of 1926 estates were allowed a tax credit not to exceed 80 percent of the
total federal estate tax for estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes paid to any of the several states, territories
or the District of Columbia. Before 1924 this credit was limited to 25 percent of the total liability, and when the
tax was introduced in 1916 no credit was allowed. Furthermore, no credit was allowed against so-called, “additional
taxes” introduced by the Revenue Act of 1932, which constituted most of the tax liability. After 1926, estates were
allowed a tax credit for gift taxes paid. This was a significant item, for example, for the returns filed in 1934, as it
constituted 11% of the total tax liability.
37 This change was retroactive, but we do not account for that aspect.

present on the tax return, and after 1981 it is equal to the spousal bequest. Before 1948, there
was no marital deduction.
The marginal tax rates are constructed by applying the actual tax structure at the time of
death to the (constructed) taxable estate. Tax rates at the age of 45 and 10 years before death are
constructed by applying the tax structure in the relevant year (in effect on the same day of that
year) to the actual taxable estate at the time of death denominated in the dollars for that year
(deflated using the CPI). For decedents younger than 45, we use the actual tax rate at death as
the tax rate at age 45.
Marital status is missing for 20% of the returns (and it is missing for all observations in 1965).
The rest of decedents are classified as either married (43%), widowed (27%), single (8%), separated
(0.1%) or divorced (1.7%). We make use of separate dummies for each type of marital status, and
omit the dummy for being single.
Age is present for 88% of the sample. It is missing for all individuals who filed their returns
in 1969, and for some subset of the remaining population. To avoid deleting these observations,
we impute their age. This is done by regressing age on a constant and a time dummy for the
rest of the population and using predicted values for the individuals with missing age.38 In our
regression we include as a separate variable a dummy for age being imputed, as well as a variable
which is equal to the imputed age for individuals with missing age, and zero otherwise. We follow
the same procedure for variables that were constructed using age (such as the tax rate at age of
45 and interactions of the tax rate with age). The coefficients on these variables are insignificant
and are not reported. Most of our specifications were also run on the sample of individuals with a
reported age. The results are not significantly different than the ones reported here.
Two other variables are present for the whole sample. The dummy variable for sex takes the
value of one for men, who constitute 68% of the sample. 87% of the individuals are testate.

38 The

predicted age in 1917 was 65.8 and the coefficient on the time dummy was .13.

Notes:
The dependent variable is the logarithm of net worth in 1945 dollars.
Standard errors are in parentheses.
In the regressions, we also controlled for age imputation dummy, imputed age, imputed age square, and S&P 500
at age of 45 interacted with the age imputation dummy.
The three tax measures described in Table 2 are used as instruments in specification I. The ten year lagged values
and the values at age 45 are added in specification II. In specification III, dummies for married and widowed
individuals dying in years when the limited marital deduction was available (1948-1981) and when the unlimited
marital deduction was available (post 1981) are also included.

Notes:
The dependent variable is the logarithm of net worth in 1945 dollars.
Standard errors are in parentheses.
In the regressions, we also controlled for age imputation dummy, imputed age, imputed age square, and S&P 500
at age of 45 interacted with the age imputation dummy.
The set of instruments includes all the ones listed in the notes to Table 3, and, additionally, all these instruments
interacted with the variable analyzed in a given specification.
