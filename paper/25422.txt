Abstract
Since October 2008 fixed rates for interest rate swaps with a thirty year maturity
have been mostly below treasury rates with the same maturity. Under standard assumptions this implies the existence of arbitrage opportunities. This paper presents a
model for pricing interest rate swaps where frictions for holding bonds limit arbitrage.
I show analytically that negative swap spreads should not be surprising. In the calibrated model, swap spreads can reasonably match empirical counterparts without the
need for large demand imbalances in the swap market. Empirical evidence is consistent with the relation between term spreads and swap spreads in the model. Keywords:
Swap spread, limited arbitrage, fixed income arbitrage (JEL: G12, G13).

Introduction

Interest rate swaps are the most popular derivative contracts. According to the Bank for
International Settlements, for the first half of 2015, the notional amount of such contracts
outstanding was 320 trn USD. In a typical interest rate swap in USD, a counterparty periodically pays a fixed amount in exchange for receiving a payment indexed to LIBOR. Since
October 2008, the fixed rate on swaps with a thirty year maturity has typically been below
treasuries with the same maturity, so that the spread for swaps relative to treasuries has
been negative. What in 2008 may have looked like a temporary disruption related to the
most virulent period of the financial crisis has persisted for years, see Figure 1.

Figure 1: Swap Spreads. Diﬀerence between fixed swap rate and treasury yield of same
maturity. Units are in basis points.
Negative swap spreads are challenging for typical asset pricing models as they seem to
imply a risk-free arbitrage opportunity. By investing in a treasury bond and paying the
lower fixed swap rate, an investor can generate a positive cash flow. With repo financing for
the bond, the investor would also typically receive a positive cash flow from the diﬀerence
between LIBOR and the repo rate. If the position is held to maturity, and if LIBOR remains
above repo, this represents a risk-free arbitrage. In reality, a shorter horizon exposes the
investor to the risk of an even more negative swap spread. Possible disruptions in the repo
funding can also make such an investment risky, and capital requirements can add costs.
While there seem to be good reasons for why arbitrage would be limited in this case, there
are so far no equilibrium asset pricing models that are consistent with negative swap spreads.
This paper develops a model for pricing interest rates swaps that features limited arbitrage. In the model, dealers invest in fixed income securities. A dealer can buy and sell
risk-less debt with diﬀerent maturities, as well as interest rate swaps. Debt prices are exogenous, the model prices swaps endogenously. Without frictions, the price of a swap equals
its no-arbitrage value, and the swap spread has to be positive. When frictions limit the size
of the dealer’s fixed income investments, swaps cannot be fully arbitraged, and swaps are
priced with state prices that are not fully consistent with bond prices.
2

My main finding is that with limited arbitrage, negative swaps spreads are not surprising
anymore, even without explicit demand eﬀects. With frictions, dealers have smaller bond
positions and are less exposed to long-term interest rate risk. They require less compensation
for the exposure to the fixed swap rate and, therefore, the swap rate is lower. In the model,
in the limit as frictions become more extreme, the unconditional expectations of the swap
rate and LIBOR are equalized. With long-term treasury rates typically larger than LIBOR,
the swap spread would then naturally be negative. Equivalently, because the TED spread is
typically smaller than the term spread, the swap spread would be negative. Quantitatively,
with moderate frictions for holding long-term bonds, the model can produce thirty-year swap
spreads in the range observed since October 2008. Model extensions such as demand eﬀects
and swap holding costs can aﬀect swap rates in meaningful ways, but they are unlikely to
be the main drivers of recent negative swap spreads. Explicit leverage constraints or capital
requirements are shown to aﬀect swap spreads similarly to holding costs for long-term bonds.
Another implication of the model is that, conditional on short-term rates, term spreads are
negatively related to swap spreads. Empirical evidence consistent with this regularity is
presented.
Practitioners have advanced a number of potential explanations for why swap spreads
have turned negative, the so-called swap spread inversion. Consistently among the main
reasons is the notion that stepped-up banking regulation in the wake of the global financial
crisis has made it more costly for banks to hold government bonds. For instance, Bowman
and Wilkie (2016) at Euromoney magazine write on this topic: "... there is little doubt
about the impact of regulation — primarily the leverage ratio and supplementary leverage
ratio — on bank balance-sheet capacity and market liquidity. ... The leverage ratio has made
the provision of the repo needed to buy treasuries prohibitively expensive for banks." As it
has become more costly for banks to hold treasuries, apparent arbitrage opportunities can
persist. In my model, it is costly for dealers to hold treasuries and this reduces the size
of their bond positions. This leads to the possibility that swaps are no longer priced in
line with treasuries. A key insight provided by my model is that with arbitrage limited in
this way, swap spreads should naturally be negative, even in the absence of explicit demand
eﬀects. Banks have been required to disclose their supplementary leverage ratios starting
in 2015. Consistent with the model, as shown in Figure 1, empirical swap spreads declined
sharply in 2015. More generally, the anticipation of new capital requirements, as well as
other regulatory changes impacting dealer arbitrage trades between swaps and government
bonds following the financial crisis, motivate the frictions in the model that lead to negative
swap spreads.
A large literature has developed models with limited arbitrage where frictions faced by
3

specialized investors can aﬀect prices. For instance, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) consider
mispricing due to the limited capital of arbitrageurs, Dow and Gorton (1994) study the impact of holding costs when traders have limited horizons. Other examples include Garleanu,
Pedersen and Poteshman (2009) on pricing options when risk-averse investors cannot hedge
perfectly, Gabaix, Krishnamurthy and Vigneron (2007) on the market for mortgage-backed
securities, and Vayanos and Vila (2009) who price long-term bonds with demand eﬀects. Liu
and Longstaﬀ (2004) analyze portfolio choice for arbitrageurs with collateral constraints, and
Tuckman and Vila (1992) with holding costs. For a survey of this literature, see Gromb and
Vayanos (2010). As in most of these papers, in my model specialized investors determine
the price of some security with other prices given exogenously. So far, this literature has not
considered interest rate swaps.1
Empirical studies have documented the drivers of swap spreads with factor models, in
particular Liu, Longstaﬀ and Mandell (2006) and Feldhuetter and Lando (2008). More
recently, Hanson (2014) documents the relation between MBS duration and swap spreads.
Gupta and Subrahmanyam (2000) study swap prices relative to the prices of interest rate
futures, and Eom, Subrahmanyam and Uno (2002) the links between USD and JPY interest
rate swaps. Collin-Dufresne and Solnik (2001) focus on the impact of the LIBOR panel
selection for swap pricing. Johannes and Sundaresan (2007) theoretically and empirically
find an increase in swap rates due to collateralization. Studies that focus on the period
with negative swap spreads include Smith (2015) who analyzes the principal components in
swap spreads, and Klinger and Sundaresan (2016) who document a relation between pension
funds duration hedging and negative swap spreads. Boyarchenko, Gupta, Steele and Yen
(2018) present an example of how regulatory changes have aﬀected the cost for supervised
institutions to enter interest swap spread trades.2
My paper contributes to the literature by developing a model that determines swap
spreads with limited arbitrage. It is shown analytically and quantitatively that the model
can plausibly explain negative swap spreads. The model is also shown to be consistent with
additional empirical evidence on the relation between swap spreads and term spreads. In my
model long-term debt and swaps are modelled with geometric amortization, a feature used
for tractability in models for corporate debt or sovereign debt, following Leland (1998). The

the chemical industry, suggesting market timing motivation. Jermann and Yue (2018) present a model of
nonfinancial firms’ swap demand. Both of these abstract from the swap spread.

model remains challenging numerically because it includes a dynamic portfolio problem with
potentially large short and long positions in multiple securities with incomplete markets that
needs to be combined with the pricing of swap contracts with a long maturity. Only a global
solution seems to be able to oﬀer the required numerical precision.
In the rest of the paper the model is first presented, followed by analytical characterizations of the arbitrage-free case and the case with frictions. Section 4 contains the model’s
quantitative implications and additional empirical evidence on swap spreads. Section 5 concludes.

Model

A dealer with an infinite horizon invests in bonds and swaps. Bond prices are exogenous, the
swap price is endogenous. The model is driven by the exogenous prices for the bonds and
inflation. Long-term bonds and swaps have geometric amortization with a given maturity
parameter.

2.1

Available assets

The dealer chooses among three securities: short-term risk-free debt (which we can think of as
treasury or repo), long-term default-free debt (treasury bonds), and fixed-for-floating interest
rate swaps. The risk averse dealer takes prices as given and maximizes the lifetime utility of
profits. Prices for swaps are determined in equilibrium to clear the swap market. The demand
for swaps is assumed to come from endusers such as corporations and insurance companies.
Swap contracts are free of default risk, as they nowadays are mostly collateralized. The
fixed swap rate can diﬀer from the long-term bond with the same maturity because the
floating leg pays LIBOR which typically exceeds the short-term treasury rate. A process for
the LIBOR rate is assumed. Because holding bonds is costly, the dealer cannot arbitrage
between securities in a frictionless way, and this creates an additional wedge between fixed
swap rates and rates for long-term bonds.
Short-term riskless debt pays one unit of the numeraire (the dollar) next period and has
a current price of
 () = exp (− ()) 
with  the log of the short rate. The exogenous  follows a finite-state Markov process.
LIBOR debt pays one unit of the numeraire next period. The price of LIBOR debt is
 () = exp (− ())
5

with the log yield
 () =  () +  () 
We can think of  as the so-called TED ("Treasury Euro-Dollar") spread, where LIBOR
is referred to as the Euro-Dollar rate. Historically, 3-month TED spreads have never been
negative; the model will satisfy this property. The TED spread can be thought of as compensating for some disadvantage of bank debt relative to the risk-free debt. This could
be reduced liquidity or higher default risk. Explicitly modelling the sources of this spread
would be conceptually straightforward, but would burden computations, without an obvious
benefit for the current analysis.
Long-term default-free debt pays
 + 
per period, where  is the coupon and  the amortization rate, implying an average
maturity of 1. In the next period the owner of the bond gets
0
( 0 ) 
 +  + (1 − ) 
0
where 
is the market price of the long-term bond next period. The price of this bond is
related to its yield to maturity, exp ( ) − 1, which after solving for the infinite sum can be
written as
 + 

 () =
exp ( ()) − 1 + 

Clearly, with the bond at par,  () = 1 , we have  = exp ( ()) − 1. We model the
exogenous yield process as
 () =  () +  () 
with  () the stochastic term spread. Note that this relation between  and  is without
loss of generality;  and  are constants.
Swaps pay a constant coupon in exchange for LIBOR. The value of a swap, or its price,
is denoted by . This price captures mark-to-market gains and losses for the swap. In
particular, next period, the fixed rate receiver of the swap gets
 − (

1
 ()

− 1) + (1 − ) 0 

with  the fixed coupon rate. The maturity parameter for the swap, , is the same as
for the long-term debt. This could easily be changed, but given our focus on the spreads
of swaps and bonds with the same maturity, does not seem useful. My way of modelling

6

an interest rate swap with geometric amortization is inspired by Leland’s (1998) model for
long-term debt. As in this case, the advantage of this representation is that the swap does
not age, and the model does not require swaps with multiple maturities.
A newly minted swap has its coupon rate set so that the swap has a market value of zero,
 = 0. The coupon rate  for which the current price of the swap equals zero is called the
swap rate,  . The swap spread is defined as
 − (exp ( ) − 1) 
Empirically, swaps have zero initial value, and new swap contracts are continuously offered with fixed coupon rates so that the contract value is zero. In the general model, where
the net demand facing the dealer,  () , is not zero, we can think that the model has only
one swap, whose coupon does not change but that is traded at its mark-to-market value.
The dealer then only trades the swap with this fixed coupon, and not new at-market swaps.
Having a new at-market swap every period would create an infinite dimensional state variable, and make the model intractable. For the special case with a net demand of swaps
facing the dealer that is zero for all periods,  () = 0, the existence of swaps does not
aﬀect the equilibrium. Therefore, new swaps, with normalized coupons can be continuously
introduced and priced, and a time-series of swap rates can be generated in the model. Given
this obvious advantage, most of the numerical analysis is focused on this special case.
Long or short positions for bonds are potentially costly to hold for the dealer. Specifically,
the cost for holding short-term debt is given by
 (0 ) =

 0 2
( ) 
2

(1)

The cost is incurred in the current period, with  ≥ 0 the cost parameter and 0 the
amount of the short-term bond bought this period and held into next period. Similarly, the
cost for long-term debt is
 0 2
( ) 
(2)
 (0 ) =
2
These costs capture financing and regulatory costs and create the frictions that limit perfect
arbitrage. The quantitative analysis below also considers capital requirements that can be
seen as contributing to bond holding costs.
It is straightforward to introduce a cost function for holding swaps. To keep the theoretical analysis focused, this is postponed to the quantitative section of the paper, and the
derivations are in the appendix. The costs and the consequences for equilibrium swap prices
depend to a large extent on the exogenous demand the dealer is facing.

Maximization, equilibrium, and solution

payouts. Specifically, the dealer solves

the Uzawa-Epstein type,  ( ) = (1 + ̄)− , with   0 and ̄ equilibrium consumption
which the dealer does not internalize. With this specification the dealer discounts the future
more when wealth and consumption/payouts are high. Relative to a constant discount factor,
wealth accumulation is favored when wealth is low and limited when wealth is high. This
helps make the model more tractable numerically, but does not directly produce pricing
frictions. This specification is popular for inducing stationarity in small open models with
incomplete markets, following Mendoza (1991) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003).

As is clear from the first-order conditions for short-term and long-term debt, holding costs
introduce a wedge in the dealer’s Euler equations. As a consequence, the price of the swap
— given in equation 5 — is typically not equal to its no-arbitrage value.

3

Analytical characterization

Several properties of the swap spread can be derived analytically. Analytical expressions
also help understand some of the quantitative findings. I focus on three cases. First, some
properties of the no-arbitrage case are reviewed. Second, it is shown how frictions for holding
short-term and long-term debt aﬀect swap prices in general, and for the specific frictions
considered in my quantitative model. For the third case, it is shown how with very strong
frictions a negative swap spread should be expected.3

3.1

No-arbitrage case

In this subsection, the swap spread is characterized explicitly when arbitrage is ruled out,
and it is shown why a limited arbitrage approach is needed to produce a negative swap
spread. Specifically, ruling out arbitrage, this section establishes that if the TED spread
(three-month LIBOR minus three-month treasury) is constant, the swap spread is equal to
that constant value, and otherwise, if TED is nonnegative, the swap spread also needs to be
nonnegative.
Rewriting the dealer’s first-order condition for the swap for a more general state-price
process, explicit sequential time-indexing, and with an analytically more convenient additive
notation for the TED spread, the price of the swap is given as

Ω is the present value of a sequence of geometrically declining, potentially random, payoﬀs
, that are paid out with a one period lag. Intuitively, the term  Ω ({1}) captures the
annuity value of receiving the fixed coupon, while 1 − Ω ({1}) represents the value of a
floating rate note paying the risk-free short rate adjusted for the amortization payments.

As is clear from equation (7), if  = ,
 −  = 
If  ≥ 0,

 −  ≥ 0

To summarize these results, ruling out arbitrage, the swap spread equals the present value of
a TED annuity scaled by the present value of a constant annuity at 1. If TED is non-negative,
the swap spread is non-negative. If TED is constant, the swap spread equals the constant
TED spread. Clearly, without violation of arbitrage, the swap spread cannot be negative. In
10

my model, arbitrage is limited by the holding costs for bonds. Instead of the geometrically
amortizing structures, the same argument can be made with standard swaps and bullet
bonds. In this subsection, there is no advantage of using the geometrically amortizing bond;
it is essential however for numerical tractability.

3.2

Bond holding frictions

I now assume that there are frictions for the one-period debt and for the long-term debt with
the same maturity as the swap. Note that this is more general than the quantitative model
presented in Section 2 because no assumptions are made about whether the dealer trades
bonds for other maturities and because the frictions can be more general.
As above, assume that the value of the swap satisfies

complete markets, the dealer’s valuations do not necessarily equal those of other market participants. Through this channel, demand eﬀects can also aﬀect the price of the swap. However, such market incompleteness or segmentation cannot produce a negative swap spread as
long as  has a zero probability of becoming negative. To produce negative swap spreads,
the dealer needs to be subject to frictions either for the short rate or the long rate corresponding to the maturity of the swap. The intuitive reason why this has to be the case is
that the payout of a swap can be replicated synthetically (except for the TED spread) with
a combination of these two types of debt, one-period debt and debt with the same maturity
as the swap.

This equation shows that if the dealer has a long position in long-term bonds, an increase
in the frictional cost — every else equal — lowers the swap spread. Intuitively, the long-term
bond holding cost lowers the net-of-cost return of long-term bonds and the required return
on the fixed swap leg also declines. This connection is even more transparent for the special
case presented in the next subsection.
Equation (9) also illustrates the impact of an increase in the term spread, everything
else equal. In response, the dealer will increase the position on long-term debt and typically
reduce the position in short-term debt. Together, this will lead to a lower swap spread.

Terms other than 
+1 and +1 in the equation can change too, but they are not likely to

expected short rates, which on average lead to increases in the ΛΛ+1
model confirms this negative relation between term spreads and swap spreads.
Equation (9) also shows that if the dealer’s positions are smaller in absolute value, everything else equal, the swap spread will be less distorted by holding costs. This will be the
case when the dealer’s equity is low.

Swap pricing with very strong frictions

To illustrate the main mechanism that allows the model to produce negative swap spreads, I
am now presenting an analytic characterization of the quantitative model for the case where
bond holdings costs are very large.
In the limit, as holding costs increase, the dealer will not hold any bonds. That is, as
 and  get larger, with  = 0 and constant endowment of other profits,  () = ,
consumption/payouts tend to equal endowment and be constant. In this limiting case, the

In the quantitative model, inflation uncertainty does not play a big role. To get a sharper
characterization, consider the case with no inflation uncertainty,  =  . Taking unconditional expectations,

and

¡
  =   =   +  ( )

because the weights,  , implicitly defined by Equation 10, are constant with  =  and
add up to one. Therefore, in this case, the swap rate equals the unconditional expected value
of LIBOR, or equivalently, the unconditional expected short rate plus the TED spread.
For comparison, the unconditional mean of the long-term treasury yield can be written
as
¢
¡
¢
¡
  =   +  (  )

where  (  ) is the unconditional mean term spread. Combining the two, the unconditional
expectation of the swap spread equals

17%, so that

Therefore, in the limiting case for which very strong frictions prevent arbitrage, the expected
swap spread should be roughly −1%. Intuitively, the high holding costs drive down the
dealer’s bond positions and reduce the exposure to long-term interest rate risk. The swap is
perceived to be less risky, and the required fixed rate declines. Of course, this is an extreme
and unrealistic benchmark case. Nevertheless, it shows that in a world with limited arbitrage

Quantitative analysis

In this section the model is calibrated and solved numerically. Quantitative model implications for swap prices are presented. I show that as bond holding costs are increased, the
swap spread declines away from its arbitrage-free benchmark. The calibrated model has
no diﬃculty generating negative swap spreads even without explicit demand pressure. The
section concludes with additional empirical evidence in support of the model.

4.1

Parameterization

Processes for bond prices and inflation are specified so that the model matches key empirical
facts. A period in the model is a quarter. The joint process for the short rate, the term
spread, inflation and the TED spread,
[ ()   ()   ()   ()] 
is based on an estimated first-order vector autoregression. The data is for U.S. treasuries
with 3-month and 30-year maturities and CPI inflation covering 1960-Q1 to 2015-Q3. TED
spreads are available from 1986-Q1 onwards. TED spreads do not significantly enter the
other three variables’ equations. Innovations in the TED spread have very low correlations
with the short rate and the term spread; I set these correlations to zero. The elements in
the transition matrix that are not statistically significant are set to zero and equations are
re-estimated with the zero restrictions.

As shown below, all series are quite persistent, and the only significant oﬀ-diagonal
15

interaction terms go from lagged inflation to the short rate and from lagged inflation to the
TED spread. The transition matrix is

The VAR is approximated by a finite-state Markov chain following Gospodinov and
Lkhagvasuren (2014) with a total of 34 = 81 possible realizations. Two sets of adjustments
are made to the Markov chain obtained in this way. First, it is made sure that there are no
arbitrage opportunities between the short-term and long-term bonds. This requires a slight
reduction in the term spread for the highest realization of the long-term yield. Second,
realizations for the TED spread are limited by a lower bound of 00003, which corresponds
to the lowest historical end-of-quarter value. This is to make sure that negative swap spreads
cannot come from negative TED spreads, which a linear VAR does not rule out. This requires
increasing negative TED realizations to 00003 and adjusting small positive realizations so
as to keep the unconditional expectation of the TED spread at the targeted (per quarter)
level of ̄ = 000158. Additional profits are set to  () = 0
The average maturity of the swap and long-term debt, 1, corresponds to 120 quarterly
periods, that is 30 years. For the benchmark case, risk aversion is set to 2. With this
value, the dealer has long/short positions about 80% of the time; for higher values, positive
positions for both bonds are more common. The discount elasticity parameter equals  = 1,
and the cost parameter for short term debt is set to  = 0. I consider several values for
the cost parameter for long-term debt  . Focusing on holding costs for long-term bonds as
the main friction is consistent with the example of a typical swap spread trade presented in
Boyarchenko et al (2018). The model is solved globally with an algorithm that shares features
with Judd (1992), Judd, Kubler and Schmedders (2002), and Stepanchuk and Tsyrennikov
(2015).

Table 2: Swap Spreads in the Data and the Model. Units are annualized basis points (that
is multiplied by 40000). Unless indicated otherwise, the cost parameter for long-term bonds
 = 00032.  ( ) is the mean marginal cost for holding long-term bonds.

4.2

Model properties

Swap spreads with a thirty-year maturity from the model are compared to their empirical
counterparts in Table 2. Unconditional expectations and standard deviations are presented
for a set of values for  , the holding cost parameter for the long-term debt, with short-term
debt costs at  = 0.
As  increases, arbitrage becomes more costly and the unconditional mean of the
swap spread goes from positive 62 basis points with a low cost of  = 0001 to negative
−54 basis points for the highest cost presented,  = 01. Clearly, the model has no
diﬃculty producing realistic negative values for swap spreads. The pattern shown in Table
2 is consistent with the analytical characterization for the high friction case: as arbitrage
becomes more costly, swap rates decline and spreads become negative. The mean level post2008 is matched with a cost parameter at  = 0032. The low cost case with  = 0001
produces a mean swap spread corresponding roughly to the pre-2008 average. Therefore,
with two diﬀerent levels of the long-term bond cost parameter  , everything else equal,
the model can roughly match the swap spread levels of the periods before and after 2008,
respectively.
To get a sense of the magnitudes of the frictional costs implied by the long-term bond
cost parameters   we can consider the marginal cost implied in equilibrium. Given
17

the quadratic cost function, the unconditional expectation of the marginal cost equals
¡
¢

  
+1 , with +1 the (endogenous) long-term bond position. Table 2 reports these
in units of annualized basis points, which are the same units as the swap spreads. For the
benchmark case with  = 0032 the marginal cost amounts to 102 basis points in annualized terms and the swap spread has a mean of −18 basis points. Over the entire sample
period available for the TED spread, its mean is 63 basis points; for the post 10/2008 period, the mean is lower, at 35 basis points. To get a tighter benchmark for the post 10/2008
period, I target the post 10/2008 level for the TED spread without changing its dynamics,
and search over the cost parameter  that can produce the post 10/2008 average swap
spread of −18 basis points. As shown in the table, a cost parameter of 0014 is required.
This corresponds to a mean marginal cost of 80 basis points.
As one of the holding costs for long-term bonds, large U.S. banks are subject to the
Supplementary Leverage Ratio (Bowman and Wilkie (2016), Davis Polk (2014), Boyarchenko
et al (2018)) that requires them to hold 5% or 6% of tier 1 capital against total assets at the
holding or the bank level, respectively. Assuming a required return on equity of 10%, the
implied cost would be 5% × 10% = 50 or 60 basis points.4 Therefore, this requirement, if
binding, would have a cost not far from the magnitude needed for the model to match the
expected swap spread. Even if this capital requirement is not binding, banks would likely
want to consider a precautionary buﬀer. It is interesting to note that the steep decline in
the longer maturity swap spreads starting January 2015, see Figure 1, coincides with the
time banks were required to start publicly disclosing their SLR. There are several other
potential costs that have increased since the financial crises, including risk-weighted capital
requirements and FDIC insurance premiums, in addition to the restrictions due to the Volcker
rule.5 Overall, it appears that the extent of the friction in the model is empirically plausible.
As we show below, demand eﬀects have the potential to further aﬀect the swap spread in a
meaningful way.
Rearranging equation (9) for the case without short-term debt costs,  = 0, yields

Whether it is reasonable to assume that equity is expensive is subject to debate. For it to matter in this
context it is suﬃcient that dealer banks consider it to be expensive.

The Volcker rule has as its main objective to prohibit proprietary trading while allowing market making.

 , and the expected marginal cost,  · 
+1  in determining the swap spread. The
last term captures corrections for risk in  and 
+1 . For the cases reported in Table 2,
changes in the implied marginal cost are the main drivers of the swap spread. For instance,
when considering the high risk aversion case reported in the table, with  = 4, the swap
spread declines by −18 = −(36 − 18) basis points relative to the benchmark case, while the
negative of the expected marginal cost, − · 
+1 , changes by almost the same amount,
−17 = −(119 − 102). When the bond holding cost parameter  is recalibrated to produce
the same mean swap spread as for the benchmark case, the implied marginal cost for the
high risk aversion case is very close to the benchmark case, diﬀering by only 4 = 106 − 102
basis points. Therefore, the main conclusion about the frictional costs required to produce
realistic post 10/2008 swap spreads is robust to changing risk aversion within a reasonable
range. With respect to the discount rate elasticity, the link between the swap spread and
the marginal cost is even more robust. Indeed, the case with a lower discount elasticity at
 = 08 — once recalibrated to produce the same mean swap spread as for the benchmark
calibration — implies the same mean marginal cost of 102 basis points as the benchmark case.
While the model can easily match empirical mean levels of swap spreads, it cannot also
simultaneously match the standard deviation of swap spreads. In particular, when the bond
holding cost parameter is raised to match post 10/2008 negative levels of swap spreads, the
volatility of swap spreads exceeds its empirical counterpart. The tightly parameterized model
oﬀers limited degrees of freedom to more closely match this property of the data. As shown
in Table 2, increasing risk aversion can lower the standard deviation relative to the mean.
However, this also reduces the fraction of the time a dealer has long/short positions, so that
the investment behavior resembles less to that of a typical levered dealer the model aims
to represent. Dealers in the model have relatively modest amounts of leverage, as is more
explicitly discussed below when studying leverage constraints. To bring the model closer to
the data, a richer representation of the dealer’s objective function would be required. Table
2 includes two additional cases illustrating that risk in inflation and risk in the TED spread
have relatively moderate eﬀects on the swap spread.
4.2.1

Demand eﬀects and swap costs

While demand eﬀects and swap costs are not necessary to produce realistic swap spreads,
I am considering here the potential impact, qualitatively and quantitatively, of extending
the model to include these features. Overall, these frictions have the potential to make
meaningful contributions to the determination of the swap rate, but they are not likely to
be able to explain on their own the decline in swap spreads since 2008.

percentage points (that is multiplied by 400). The demand sensitivity measures the change

complex. With  () = 0, the equilibrium swap price does not aﬀect the dealer’s bond
investments, and the equilibrium computation can proceed recursively by first solving the
bond investment problem and then the swap pricing function. With  () 6= 0 the swap
price matters for the investment problem, and the investment problem and the swap pricing
function have to be solved jointly. To preserve numerical tractability, I am limiting the model
to one swap whose coupon is determined for an initial state of the model (0  0 ).
I am considering models with diﬀerent levels of a fixed demand  () =  and compare
the resulting swap rates for the same initial state. Specifically, am solving for the swap rates
  (0  0   = 0) and  ( 0  0   = ) and compute the demand sensitivity measure

This measures the change in percentage points of the swap spread in response to a demand
change as a percent of the net asset position  0 . I am setting  0 to its mean for the case
 () = 0 and 0 to the neutral shock that has all exogenous variables at their mean log
levels. For small values of  0 , say 20% or less, the demand sensitivity measure does not
depend in a significant way on . Table 3 reports demand sensitivity measures for  () = 02

20

which corresponds to 10 − 20% of  0 depending on the case. For the benchmark case with
 = 0032 the computed demand elasticity is −99. This means that for a 1% increase in
demand as a share of the dealer’s net asset value  0 , the swap rate (equivalently the swap
spread) declines by 99 of a basis point. As the table shows, this demand sensitivity depends
crucially on the extent of the friction for long-term bonds. In the model, even without bond
costs, the dealer cannot perfectly hedge the swap, but that eﬀect is small. For the case with
a very low long-term bond cost of  = 0001, the demand sensitivity reported declines to
−14.
A non-zero swap demand creates a risk exposure for the dealer that can be partially
oﬀset with long-term bonds. With a positive , the dealer becomes a net fixed rate payer
on the swap, and this exposure can be partially hedged by adding long exposure to longterm bonds. As is shown in Table 3, the position in long-term bonds increases in each case
when  is increased. This implies an increase in the marginal bond holding cost, leading to a
lower swap rate. Very intuitively, an increase in the demand for receiving fixed rate payments
lowers the fixed payments to be received. There is no obvious empirical counterpart available
for the size of such demand eﬀects. The results in the table suggest that while this type of
demand eﬀect has the potential to be meaningful, for demand eﬀects to play a major role in
driving swap spreads, the size of the demand imbalances would have to be very large relative
to dealers’ asset holdings, and the frictional costs should be nonnegligible. Remember also
that, as shown in Section 3.2, to get swap spreads to be negative at all some frictions are
needed.
Dealer holding costs for swaps represent another friction that has the potential to aﬀect
swap rates. Assuming a quadratic cost function for swaps that parallels the bond cost
functions implies a marginal cost of  0 , and in equilibrium 0 = −. Extending the
decomposition from the previous section we have

cost is straightforward. The dealer has to be compensated for the marginal holding cost,

marginal cost corresponds essentially to a one basis point change in the swap rate. The
swap rate increases or decreases depending on whether the exogenous demand is negative
or positive, respectively. For the examples in the table, the marginal cost in all cases is
exactly   = 0005 × 02 = 001, in annualized terms (as in the table) this is 04%. The

decline in the swap rate due to the introduction of the swap cost is reported to be very close
to this value as suggested by Equation (12) in all cases; for instance, 04052% for the case
with  = 00032. Recent regulation has likely also increased dealer’s swap holding costs.
However, these costs are unlikely to be in the same order of magnitude as for long-term
bonds, and it is unlikely that dealers face direct marginal costs for holding swaps that would
be large enough to be solely responsible for the decline in the swap rates since 2008. See for
instance the example in Boyarchenko et al (2018).
4.2.2

Leverage constraint

The quadratic bond holding cost functions used so far oﬀer a tractable and parsimonious
way to quantify the costs induced by the multitude of regulatory changes since 2008. In this
subsection, the model is specialized to specifically study the impact of a leverage constraint or
capital requirement. Recent regulatory changes have tightened existing capital requirements
and introduced new ones (see for instance, Greenwood et al (2017) for a survey of these
changes), and these have likely contributed to increased costs for typical swap dealers.
The following constraint is added to the dealer’s problem
max (0  ()  0) + max (0  ()  0) ≤  · 
with the parameter   1, the leverage multiplier. With this constraint, a long bond position
needs to be supported by a minimal amount of dealer book equity, the net asset position,
. The Supplementary Leverage Ratio is an example of such a constraint. The constraint
could also account for the derivative exposure of the swap. Given the regulatory complexity
in that regard, and our analysis in the previous section suggesting that this is unlikely to be
quantitatively significant, this is abstracted from here.
With this constraint, the first-order conditions become

 ≥ 0, and 0 otherwise.6
As equation (14) shows, the current period multiplier, , can increase the dealer’s implicit
marginal cost for long-term bonds, just as the convex cost function 1 (0 ) does. This leads
to lower returns for long-term bonds and to a reduced swap rate in equilibrium, as discussed
for the benchmark model above. In addition, the leverage constraint can increase the implicit
cost for short-term bonds. The leverage constraint also aﬀects the implied valuations directly
through 0 in each of the first-order conditions. But as discussed above, this type of distortion
cannot alone make swap spreads negative. To examine the overall eﬀect and the quantitative
impact of this constraint, the computational algorithm is augmented to include features from
the approach presented in Judd, Kubler and Schmedders (2002).
Table 4 presents model properties for the benchmark calibration with very low bond
holding costs  = 00001 (with no costs for short term bonds and swaps) and compares
model versions with diﬀerent constraint parameters .
The case without the leverage constraint, equivalently  = ∞, is the low friction case seen
in Table 2 and Table 3. In this case, the swap spread has an unconditional expectation of
62 basis points and the swap spread never gets negative. As the table shows, tightening the
constraint lowers the mean swap spread and increases the frequency of swap spreads being
negative. The tightest constraint presented uses  = 5 and produces negative swap spreads
66% of the time and a mean swap spread of −25 basis points. As these results show, the
leverage constraint acts on the swap spread like the cost for long-term bonds (as suggested
by the first-order condition (14)).
From a quantitative perspective, to produce a negative mean swap spread would require
a leverage parameter smaller than  = 10, equivalently a leverage ratio 1 of more than
10%. Therefore the SLR requirement of 5% or 6% would not alone be suﬃcient to produce

The constraint is not diﬀerentiable at 0 = 0 and 0 = 0. To have well-defined first-order conditions,
one can use smooth approximations of the max functions around the kink. Practically, with   1, the
constraint does not bind with either 0 or 0 close to 0, because to have the left hand side of the leverage
constraint exceed , the budget constraint, with   0 and  () = 0 would require that either 0 or 0
be negative.

negative swap spreads on average. This may not be too surprising as the model does not
include any of the features typically being thought of as rationalizing dealer banks’ views
that equity is expensive. If anything, it can seem surprising that the capital requirements
have such a significant impact on the swap price in this setting. As shown in the table,
the capital requirement mostly limits the size of the long position in long-term bonds. For
instance, with  = 10, the constraint binds 14% of the time, and in essentially 100% of
these cases, it is the long-term debt that is constrained. In the model, the dealer values the
ability to invest in long-term bonds when the term premium is high. The leverage constraint
limits this strategy. Overall, for a single leverage constraint alone to produce negative mean
swap spreads would require a constraint that is tighter than the SLR. However, a leverage
constraint can have a significant impact on swap prices even without explicitly including
model features that make equity expensive from a bank’s perspective.

4.3

Additional empirical evidence

A key model mechanism is the relation between the term spread and the swap rate. As shown
in Subsection 3.3, in the limiting case where the dealer holds no long-term bonds, the swap
spread declines one for one with the term spread, because the risk premium in long-term
bonds does not get incorporated into the price of the swap. In the time series dimension, in
the model, this relation is not very strong unconditionally. However, conditional on a given
level of the short rate, the term spread is robustly negatively related to the swap spread.
Figure 2 shows how term spreads and swap spreads are related conditional on given levels
of the short rate. In particular, each set of lines of a given color corresponds to a fixed level
of the short rate. The dealer’s equity, , is also a state variable, but its impact on the swap
rate is relatively less important. The figure shows swap spreads for the mean level of equity
for a given combination of the term spread, the short rate, inflation and TED. Inflation
and the TED spread do not significantly aﬀect this relationship. Indeed, for a given color,
multiple lines represent diﬀerent inflation rates and TED spreads; these lines are close to
each other. The rest of this section presents empirical evidence that is consistent with this
model property.
Table 5 displays the coeﬃcients from regressing swap spreads with diﬀerent maturities on
a number of factors one would expect to be relevant. As suggested by my model, this includes
the term spread between thirty-year and three-month treasuries, three-month treasuries
rates, and the TED spread. In line with Feldhuetter and Lando (2008) and Hanson (2014),
the duration of mortgage backed securities (MBSD) is included as it appears to capture
hedging demands for investors in MBS. To control for other factors that can aﬀect swap

spreads, the market volatility index (VIX) is also included.
Table 5 covers the period 7/1997 to 5/2018. Regressions are based on monthly growth
rates for all the variables. Consistent with the model, the term spread, TERM, is negatively
related to the thirty-year swap spread and significant at the 1% level. Running the regression
without TERM produces an adjusted R2 of 008; including TERM boosts that value to 018.
The relationship is weaker for the shortest maturities, particularly 2 and 5 years.
As expected, the TED spread factors in positively. It is also not surprising that this eﬀect
is weaker for longer maturities. As the swap spread is driven by the sequence of future TED
spreads over the period to maturity of the swap, the current TED spread should be relatively
less important for longer maturities. Consistent with the prior research cited above, MBSD
is positively related to the swap spread. VIX matters only for the shorter maturities.
Table 6 presents the same regression for the post-crisis sample. For the thirty-year
maturity there is again a negative eﬀect from the term spread. Somewhat unexpectedly
TED now is significantly negatively related to the longer maturity swap spreads.
Large U.S. banks have been required to publicly disclose their Supplementary Leverage
Ratio starting 2015. As shown in Figure 1, this marks the beginning of a steep decline in
the swap spread that went on throughout 2015. Focusing on the period from 1/2015 until
5/2018, Table 7 shows a strong negative connection between the term spread and the thirty

Conclusion

Negative swap spreads are inconsistent with an arbitrage-free environment. In reality, arbitrage is not costless. I have presented a model where specialized dealers trade swaps and
bonds of diﬀerent maturities. Costs for holding bonds can put a price wedge between bonds
and swaps. I show a limiting case with very high bond holding costs, expected swap spreads
should be negative. In this case, no term premium is required to price swaps, and this results
in a significantly lower fixed swap rate. As a function of the level of bond holding costs,

the model can move between this benchmark and the arbitrage-free case. The quantitative
analysis of the model shows that under plausible holding costs, expected swap spreads are
consistent with the values observed since 2008.
Demand eﬀects operate in the model, but are not necessary for these results. As frictions
for bonds increase, the impact of demand eﬀects becomes stronger. Quantitatively, demand
eﬀects are shown to have the potential to aﬀect swap spreads in a meaningful way. For
demand eﬀects to play a major role in driving swap spreads, the size of demand imbalances
would have to be very large relative to dealers’ asset holdings.
My model can capture relatively rich interest rate and inflation dynamics. Conditional
on the short rate, the model predicts a negative link between the term spread and the swap
spread. The paper has presented some empirical evidence consistent with this property.
The objective of this paper has been to present a parsimonious derivative pricing model
for interest rate swaps that goes beyond the typical no-arbitrage requirement to be consistent
with the possibility of negative swap spreads. For most of the analysis, frictions have been
modelled with cost functions for bonds and swaps that can be interpreted as summarizing
the overall increase in costs of financial intermediation following various regulatory changes.
The model could be further extended to, for instance, include additional specific regulatory
measures, or to explicitly represent repo transactions. Another possibly fruitful extension
could be to embed the dealer’s optimization into a diversified financial institution with
additional frictions.
