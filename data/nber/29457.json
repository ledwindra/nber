    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a theory of exchange rate fluctuations arising from financial institutions\u2019 demand for dollar liquid assets. Financial flows are unpredictable and may leave banks \u201cscrambling for dollars.\u201d Because of settlement frictions in interbank markets, a precautionary demand for dollar reserves emerges and gives rise to an endogenous convenience yield on the dollar. We show that an increase in the dollar funding risk leads to a rise in the convenience yield and an appreciation of the dollar, as banks scramble for dollars. We present empirical evidence on the relationship between exchange rate fluctuations for the G10 currencies and the quantity of dollar liquidity, which is consistent with the theory.\n\n",
