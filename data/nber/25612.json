    "abstract": "\n\nItaly and Germany have similar geographical differences in productivity \u2013 North more productive than South in Italy; West more productive than East in Germany \u2013 but have adopted different models of wage bargaining. Italy sets wages based on nationwide contracts that allow for limited local wage adjustments, while Germany has moved toward a more flexible system that allows for local bargaining. The Italian system has significant costs in terms of forgone aggregate earnings and employment because it generates a spatial equilibrium where workers queue for jobs in the South and remain unemployed while waiting. Our findings are relevant for other European countries.\n\n",
