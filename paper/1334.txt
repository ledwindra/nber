The Architecture of Economic Systems:
Hierarchies and Polyarchies

ABSTRACT

This paper presents some new perspectives on the structure and
performance of alternative economic organizations. We posit that decision
makers make errors of judgement (for example, they sometimes select bad
projects while rejecting good projects), and that how these errors are
aggregated within different organizations depends on their architecture (for
example, on how individuals are organized together). Using this framework, we
compare the performances of two polar forms of organizations: hierarchies and

polyarchies.
Assuming judgmental abilities of individuals are similar in the two
systems, we show that polyarchies accept a larger proportion of bad projects

(compared to hierarchies) whereas hierarchies reject a larger proportion of

good projects. We then determine the conditions under which polyarchies have

higher or lower expected profit. The conditions under which polyarchies
perform better appear to be more plausible and, moreover, this conclusion
holds also in the case where the rules for accepting or rejecting projects are
rationally determined based on the information available to individuals. The
architecture of organizations also affects their portfolio of available
projects; we determine conditions under which polyarchies have better or worse
portfolios compared to those available to hierarchies.

There are many possible extensions of our approach. Among them are the
analysis of internal structure of firms, selection of managers (by other
managers) and the reproduction and self—perpetuation of organizations over
time.

TUE ARCHITECTURE OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS:

HIERARCHIES AND POLYARCHIES

There

is a widespread belief that the internal organization of an

economic system has an important effect on its performance. Yet, there is
very little in traditional economic analysis which investigates such a

relationship.1 In this paper, we present some new ways of looking at economic
systems. We motivate our discussion in the context of economic systems, but
it has implications for the internal organization of large corporations as
well.

The thesis of this paper is that economic systems behave fundamentally
differently under different forms of organization, and that

central

to an

understanding of the performance of an economic system is an understanding of

its architecture. The architecture (like that of a computer or electrical

system)

describes, among other things, how the constituent decision making

units are arranged together in a system (i.e., who makes which decisions) and

who conveys what information to whom. Our attempt is to relate the
architecture of alternative economic systems, along with their attendant rules
for meting out rewards and punishments, to their performance.

The axiom of human behavior which plays a basic role in our analysis is
that alL decision makers make

errors

of judgment. For concreteness we focus

on simple decisions which involve accepting or rejecting certain projects.
Individuals (or the constituents of economic systems) make these decisions
based on the information available to them. In any event, because of the
errors

in judgment, some projects which get accepted should have been

rejected, and some projects which are rejected should have been accepted.

Using the analogy from the classical theory of statistical inference, these
errors correspond to Type—Il and Type—I errors.

The typology of economic systems on which we focus in this

paper

arises

from the differences in how individuals are organized together in a system.
We think of a polyarchy as a system in which there are independeat (and

possibly competing) sources of decision making. In contrast;, a hierarchy is
visualized as a system in which the decision making authority is more
concentrated.

idea (say, for a new product), then there is a possibility that some other
firm might accept it.

In contrast, if a single agency makes such decisions

and this agency rejects the idea, then the idea must remain unused. The same,
however, is also true for those ideas which are unprofitable. As a result,
one

would expect a greater incidence of Type—Il error in a

polyarchy, and a

greater incidence of Type—I error in a hierarchy.

Moreover, the mix of projects available to the two systems is also

to what we have called their architecture.

We then examine, in Section III, how the portfolio of projects available
to art economic system is influenced by its architecture. This represents more

of a general equilibrium view: the differences in the architecture will
affect the chances that different types of projects have of being accepted or
rejected. This will, in turn, influence the incentives of those who
conceptualize and invent projects, and will thus affect the kinds of projects

which are invented. For example, one would expect that the inventors would
attempt to generate those projects which are more likely to be accepted.

The above analysis takes the errors in judgment (that is, the
probabilities of good projects being rejected and those of bad projects being
selected

In this paper, we analyze only one, albeit an important one, aspect of

the architecture of economic systems. Some other important aspects are

sketched out in the concluding section.
I. TUE MODEL

In the following model, a polyarchy consists of two firms, and a
hierarchy
screen

consists of two bureaus. The

task of a bureau or a firm is to

projects. Each project has a scalar (net) benefit, which can be

—3—

positive, negative, or zero. A screen (i.e., a bureau or a firm) evaluates
every project and accepts or rejects the project.

The decision process in a polyarchy and a hierarchy are depicted in

Figures 1 and 2 respectively. In a polyarchy, the two firms screen the

projects independently. For specificity, one may think of projects arriving
randomly (with probability one—half) at one of the two firms. If a particular
project is accepted by a firm, then it is no longer available to the other

firm. If the project is rejected, then it goes to the other firm where, once
again, it can be accepted or rejected. Neither firm screens the same project
twice, so that a project can not cycle back and forth between firms.3 The
portfolio of projects selected in a polyarchy therefore consists of the
projects accepted separately by each of the two firms.

In contrast, in a hierarchy, all projects are first evaluated by the
lower bureau (bureau 1); those which are accepted are forwarded to the higher
bureau (bureau 2) and others are discarded. The projects selected by the

system then are those which pass through the higher bureau. Drawing an
analogy from the design of electrical circuits, the screens are placed in
series in a hierarchy whereas they are placed in parallel in a polyarchy.

Throughout the paper, the superscripts P and H represent a polyarchy and

a hierarchy respectively. Also, for brevity, we use the superscript s, where

s = P or H. Let x denote the net profit (benefit) from a project,4 and let
p5(x) denote the probability that this project will pass through a screen in
5

the system.

We refer to p5(x) as the screening function. Then the

probabilities that the project x will be accepted in the system s, denoted by
fS,

We refer to the portfolio of projects available to an

economic system as

the initial portfolio and the portfolio that it selects as the final

portfolio. For system s, NS denotes the number of projects in the initial

portfolio,

gS(x) denotes its pdf, and GS(x) denotes its cdf. The initial

portfolio contains both profitable and unprofitable projects, i.e., there are
projects with positive as well as negative x s.

alternative systems, then an important statistic is the expected profit. We
denote this by yS, which is7

It is useful here to ask: what is it that the economics literature
typically assumes concerning the screening functions? In the absence of
uncertainty in the outcome of projects (as in the case of the present model)9,
much of the literature makes no distinction between the projects which are

worth selecting, and those which are actually selected. This assumptioa, in
the

context

of the present model, implies that: p(x) =

p(x) = 0 if x < 0.

In this case, the performances of a polyarchy and a

hierarchy are identical in every respect, as can be easil.y verified.

Thus, the architecture of economic systems ceases to be a relevant issue,
if one

assumes

that human decision making

is

absolutely fauLtless. Even a

casual observation of actual functioning of business and public organizations,
in contrast, makes

it

abundantly clear that errors of judgment are an

inescapabLe feature of human decision making. This reaLization not only makes
it necessary to recast the traditional view of the literature, but it aLso
provides a potential cornerstone for unraveling certain hitherto unrecognized
differences among different types of organizational systems.

II. PORTFOLIOS SELECTED IN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS

—7--

In this section, we investigate two questions. First, how is the
portfolio selected in each of the two systems affected by the exogenous
parameters representing the initial portfolios and the characteristics of the

screens? Second, what is the relative performance of the final portfolios in
the

two systems, and how is this influenced by the exogenous parameters?

While answering the second question, we assume that the two systems have the

same initial portfolios and screening mechanisms; the differences in their
performance

are therefore solely

due to the difference in their

This assumption is not required for answering the first

question since it does not involve any comparison across the systems.

The statistics of the portfolio selected which we etamine in some detail

are: the proportion of original projects selected and t (expected) profit
from

the portfolio selected. We also point out how some other statistics can

be analyzed.

Therefore: A polyarchy always selects a larger proportion of initial
projects than a hierarchy.

The reason behind this result is quite intuitive. Consider a
hypothetical situation in which the second firm in a polyarchy does not accept
any project, whereas the higher bureau in a hierarchy accepts all of the

projects forwarded to it by the lower bureau. The proportion of projects
accepted in the two systems, then, would be the same, narnely, E[p(x)].

It

follows then that the actual proportion of projects accepted in a polyarchy
will

always exceed that in a hierarchy.

In fact, this intuition can be extended further. To see this, let good
(bad) projects be denoted by an arbitrary non—empty set A within the range of

x. Then the screening is completely faultless (erroneous) if
p(x) = 1 for x c A, and it is completely erroneous (faultless) if p(x) = 0,

The

signs

of (9) and

(10) can now be evaluated using the standard properties of stochastic

dominance.'' The key results are as follows.
An improvement (worsening) in the initial portfolio in the sense of
first—order stochastic dominance leads to a larger (smaller) proportion of

projects being selected in both a polyarchy and a hierarchy. An
improvement (worsening) in the initial portfolio in the sense of second—order

dominance leads to a larger (smaller) proportion of

Explicit expressions for S are derived in the Appeadix I. From these
expressions, one can obtain bounds on the magnitudes of n, and also one can
ascertain how a5 is influenced by changes in the screening function. As one
can see in Figure 3: A higher (lower) slackness in screening raises (lowers)
the proportion of projects selected in both systems. We also show that:

A

higher (lower) discriminating ability in screening lowers (raises) the

proportion selected in a polyarchy, whereas it raises (lners) the proportion
selected in a hierarchy.

B. Profit in Alternative Systeiis

Probably the single most important indicator of the performance of a

system is its (expected) profit. We begin our analysis o profit with simple
initial portfolios which contain two types of projects; mere general
portfolios are examined later.

Two Types of Projects: Consider an initial portfolio consisting of two
types of projects, good and bad, with respective net profits x and —x2, where

and x2 are positive. The probabilities of passing tLrough a screen are

denoted by parameters p1 and p2 respectively. The initial portfolio

contains a fraction n of good projects. If tY = yP —

The above expression allows us to demarcate the parameters' space ifltO

two regions: one in which a polyarchy has a higher profit than a hierarchy,

and the other in which the reverse holds. To see this in its simplest form,

line,

since p1 > p2 .

We are concerned only with the area
Now take, for a moment, the case in

which the initial portfolio contains good and bad projects in equal

proportions, i.e., n = 1/2.

Then a polyarchy has a higher profit in the

region ODA, whereas the reverse holds in the region ADB. That is, polyarchy
has a higher profit if

p1 + p2 < 1,

(12)

and the reverse holds otherwise.

The intuition behind this result is as follows. Recall that a polyarchy
selects more projects, good as well as bad, than a hierarchy. A polyarchy's
profit from good projects is greater, but so is its loss from bad projects.
For a polyarchy to perform better, therefore, its higher profit from good

projects must outweigh its higher loss from bad projects. Now, the expression
(11) shows that a polyarchy's relative profit from good projects is highest

when p1= 1/2, and this decreases when p1 diverges from one—half. Similarly,
a polyarchy's relative loss from bad projects is highest when p2 =

1/2, and

it decreases as P2 diverges from this point. When we add the gain and the
loss, then we find that a polyarchy has a higher profit level if (12) iS

satisfied.
If the initial portfolio contains a smaller proportion of good projects,

that is if n < 1/2, then from (11), we find that the parameter space is

separated by a hyperbola like OEA, which is inside the region ODA'2. A
polyarchy has a higher profit within the region OEA, and the reverse holds

outside of it. The region OEA shrinks if the proportion of good projects in
the initial portfolio is smaller, and it coincides with the line
OA if a +

0.

The opposite case, in which the initial portfolio contains a greater

proportion of good project has a parallel implication. A polyarchy then has a
higher profit outside of the region AFB, and the reverse holds inside it. Not
surprisingly, the two regions OEA and AFB coincide wIth the triangles ODA and

ADB

respectively,

as a tends to one—half.

The same figure allows us to interpret the case in which good and bad

significantly larger than p2) then

a

profit even if, within a range, the initial portfolio has fewer good projects
and if the gain from a good project is smaller than the loss from a bad

has higher profit if p1 is large, and if it is close to p2.

—13--

A qualitative summary of the results is as follows. If the Initial
portfolio improves (because of a larger proportion of good projects, a higher
gain from a good project, or a lower loss from a bad project), then the

relative profit in a polyarchy (compared to a hierarchy) improves. The
reverse happens if the initial portfolio worsens. Within a range of initial
portfolios, however, a polyarchy has a higher profit than a hierarchy if the

screening of projects is tight and if it has high discriminating ability. The
opposite conclusion holds if the screening is slack and if it has low

it might be

useful to hypothesize about the relevant range of these parameters. Common
experience suggests that the world is full of unprofitable ideas, whereas

profitable ideas are quite scarce. Also, the (net) profit that can be
typically made from even the best project is limited. In contrast, the losses

The sign of the above expression depends critically on p which, it should be
recalled, is the probability that the average project (which according to

(14a) has a nonpositive profit) will pass through a screen. For brevity in

exposition in what follows, we call the screening tight if p < 1/2.

We

note the foLlowing qualitative results.

First, the intuition developed in the earlier section concerning the

screening function is confirmed in the present case as well. Specifically, a
greater tightness or a greater discriminating ability in screens corresponds
to a higher relative profit in a polyarchy, provided the screening is tight.

Second, we obtain some new insights concerning the initial portfolio: A
larger negative skewness in the initial portfolio implies a higher relative

profit in a polyarchy. Also, a larger variance implies a higher relative
profit in a polyarchy, provided the screening is tight.

Third, we note some of the circumstances in which the profit level in a

—15—

polyarchy is greater or smaller than that in a hierarchy.

It is obvious from

(15) that if the screening of projects is indiscriminate, then the profit in a
polyarchy can not be larger than that in a hierarchy.

Therefore: For a polyarchy to have a greater profit than a hierarchy, it
is necessary that the screens should have some discriminating ability.
Further, a polyarchy has a lower profit if the inItIal portfolio is

symmetric and the screening is slack. On the other hand, a polyarchy has a
higher profit if the mean of the initial portfolio is close to zero, and if
the screening is tight.

h5(x) denote the probability that a project with profit x is among the

projects selected in system s. Then from Bayes' theorem

hS(x) =

fS(x)g(x)

Moments of the final portfolios can be derived using the above pdf.

the final portfolios can be obtained similarly.

Note that the covariance (18) is positive because p(x) is positive and,
therefore, x and fS

are

positively related. Thus: the final portfolios in

both a polyarchy as well as in a hierarchy have higher means than the means of

their initial portfolios. This happens because both systems improve upon
their initial portfolios due to the discriminating ability of their screens.'5

the performance of economic systems is affected by exogenous changes in this
Thus far we have taken the initial

portfolio. This is clearly a partial equilibrium view, since it ignores the
responses and incentives of those who invent projects. In a more general
equilibrium view, which we explore in this section, we explicitly take such
responses into account.

There are many ways to represent the incentives which influence
inventors'

behavior, the constraints which inventors face, and how these two

aspects are related to the relevant features of the alternative economic

systems. What

we emphasize here is the commonly observed fact that the

acceptance of an idea or invention is often the most significant
inventor,

reward to its

and that inventors would attempt to invent those projects which have

greater chances of being accepted in an economic system.

Specifically, we assume that the gain to an inventor from a project
—17—

depends on whether the project is accepted or not. The utilities to an
inventor from an accepted arid a rejected project are denoted by U and U
U

respectively, where Ua

and U's are exogenous paraaeters.'6 We make

this assumption partly for simplicity, but it is also true that, in the
present problem, pecuniary reward to inventors can be linked only tenuously
with the actual values of projects.17

We visualize the project creation process as follows. There are a large
number of inventors. Each of them selects a technology of invention from a
family of such technologies. A particular technology determines the number of
projects which will be generated, and it also determines the statistical

distribution from which these projects would be drawn. If inventors are
identical then, in a symmetric equilibrium, they will choose the same
technology and the resulting collection of projects will constitute the
initial project portfolio.

One can therefore represent the inventor's choice as being exercised

through parameters (N, ), where N is the number of projects and the vector
influences the pdf of the initial project portfolio. The pdf, thus, is

represented as g(x, ).

(19)

The maximand of inventors can then be written as

N[JUfSg(x, )dx + fUr(1 —

cases are worth noting.

If there is no fixed fee (that is, Ur + 0, and the second term in (20) drops

the

number of projects selected. On the

other hand, if there is no bonus (that is, Ua =

Ur

and only the second term

in (20) matters) then the inventors maximize the number of projects
invented. These responses are in accord with the intuition.

N2 = N2(N1).

Clearly, we need to consider only those cases in which there is a trade—off

function (accept or reject) of observations y.
In

addition,

the screening rules will depend on the nature of information

flows within economic systems. For example, if firms ia a polyarchy do not
share information, then a firm can not distinguish between the projects which
are being evaluated for the first time from those projects which were rejected

by the other firm.20 A firm, therefore, will use the same screening rule for

—2 1—

all projects that it receives.

On the other hand, if firms provide to one another their own observations
on

the

projects which they reject, then they might use two screening rules:

one for the projects being evaluated for the first time and another for the

rest of the projects. In fact, the same could happen even at an intermediate
level of information flow in which firms label their rejected projects.

It is important to note here that the architecture of the economic system
itself conveys some information to its constituents, which they will use in

setting Bayesian decision rules. For example, even when there is no
information sharing, the two firms would not act independently, since each
firm knows that some

of

the projects it receives are those rejected by the

other firm and, consequently, the portfolio of projects faced by a firm is not
a replica of the initial portfolio, but it has been modified by the other
firm.

Similarly,

in

a hierarchy, an important question is whether the upper

bureau uses the entire information collected in the organization (i.e.,
observations made by both bureaus) in its own screening rule,

or

that only a

part of the entire information is available at the top. In the case of no
information sharing between the bureaus, the upper burea&s screening will be
based on its own

information,

and on the knowledge of how

the

portfolio has

been modified by the lower bureau, but not on what value was observed by the
lower bureau for a particular project.2'

In the section below we examine the case in which there is noinforaation sha-

ring between screens in either of the two economic systems. This is partly
for simplicity, but it also represents a base case which brings out the trade—
of fs which would remain important regardless of the nature of information

—22—

flows.

B. cut—off Levels

Project

for Observed Project Values

evaluators often use cut—off levels for screening; a project is

accepted if its observed profit is above the cut—off level, and it is rejected

otherwise. Suppose that every screen makes one scalar observation; that the
errors in the observations made by different screens are identically and

independently

distributed; and that errors are additive,22 i.e.,

entail, in general, different cut—off points than what independent

level of profit

in the economy will be higher (or at. least no smaller) in the social optimum

than in the private optimum. What we note then, is that the selection of
projects in a polyarchy might generate an externality, although the firms are

identical (even concerning the information they have).25 This externality
could prevent the firms from using those screening rules which maximize the

economy's profit. In contrast, there is no selection externality in a
hierarchy; since the optimal screening rules maximize the economy's profit.

—25—

C. Two Types of Projects
Consider a portfolio consisting of two types of projects. Denote the
(random) observations on good and bad projects by y1 and y2 . A general

property of cut—off points is seen as follows. Suppose for a nment that the
cut—off point R in a screen is set at the highest observation that a bad

project can yield, i.e., R = max y2 .

Then, the screen will block the bad

projects completely, though several good projects might be rejected as a

consequence. It is obvious that there Is no gain in setting the cut—off point
at a level higher than max y2, since by doing so one losies additIonal good

projects, without affecting bad projects (which are not being selected in any
case).

By a similar logic, it
observation

is never advantageous to

set R below the lowest

that a good project can yield, at which level all good projects

are accepted.26 Thus
(36)

maxy2>R>rniny1

The trade—off within the above range of R is obvious: A. higher cut—off level
leads to fewer bad projects being accepted, but also to more
being

rejected. For

good projects

brevity, we refer to the upper and lover limit in (36) as

the highest and the lowest cut—off points.

In Appendix II, we have derived explicit solutions for symmetric

projects, i.e., x1 = x2 =

x,

when the observation errors are uniformly

distributed with mean zero. The qualitative results are summarized below:
(i) A lower (higher) proportion of good projects in the initial
portfolio corresponds to a tighter (slacker) screening lU

—26—

both systems. For

instance, if the proportion of good projects is greater than two—thirds, then
both systems adopt the lowest cut—off level, ensuring that no good project is
rejected.

This certainly implies a significant probability of accepting a bad

project, but this screening rule is optimal since there are fewer bad projects
in the initial portfolio.

(ii) The screening rule in a polyarchy is more conservative than that in
a hierarchy. For example, if the proportion of good projects is less than
one—half, then a polyarchy adopts the highest cut—off level, ensuring that no
bad project is selected, even though it loses many good proJects by adopting

this screening rule. In contrast, a hierarchy never finds it optimal to adopt
the highest cut—off level.

(iii) A polyarchy has a higher (lower) profit than a hierarchy if the
proportion of good projects in the initial portfolio is less (more) than one—

half. Obviously, if one hypothesizes (as we did earlier) that unprofitable
ideas typically outnumber the profitable ones in a portfolio, then the present

model predicts that a polyarchy is a superior institutional arrangement. This
result can be understood in two parts. First, as noted above, a small
proportion of good projects prompts the decision makers to set tighter

screening rules. Second, according to the intuition developed earlier in the
paper, tighter screening implies a relatively better performance in a
polyarchy.

V. CONCLUDING RENARKS

In this paper, we have proposed a typology of economic systems based on
how their constituents are arranged together. We have compared the

the two systems, when individuals use optimal decision rules based on

information available to them.

There are other important reasons as well why the nature of errors

associated with different architectures may differ. For instance, it is
widely believed that the quality of decision making (i.e., who does what)
varies greatly across organizations; some individuals are better able to

screen projects than others. Two questions that can then be posed are: (i)
How does a system's performance depend on the assignment of individuals of
different abilities to different positions within the system, and (ii) How are
these decisions affected by the system's architecture.

Decisions about who is to occupy what position within an organization are
usually made by other individuals within the system, and these decisions are
affected, in turn, by factors which are similar to those which affect

decisions on projects. Thus, the architecture of economic systems affects the
quality of those who make judgments about people as well as about projects.

This provides a basis for analyzing the ru1es of succession, and what we
call (in Sah and Stiglitz (1984b)) the self—perpetuating aspects of economic

—28—

sys terns.

Another characteristic of economic systems which affects their
performance is the nature of rewards and punishments meted out to the decision

makers. This

has, of course, been the

question around which much of the

recent literature on incentives has focused. In the present paper we have not
emphasized this aspect as much as it deserves.28 This, however, is not
because we think that incentive problems are unimportant, but because we think
that some of them are rather well understood in the literature, and the new
aspects upon which we focus here (for example, aggregation of errors) have
received insufficient attention.
On

the other hand, we should point Out that the architecture of a system

may be critical in determining what incentive

structures are feasible. For

example, in a hierarchical structure, promotions constitute an important part
of the rewards, a kind of reward which may not always be desirable in a

polyarchy. On the other hand, in polyarchical structures, several parallel
units perform similar functions, and it is possible to devise reward
structures, based on relative performance. These reward. struictures have a

number of desirable properties concerning incentive, risk, and flexibility,29

and these may not be feasible in a hierarchical system. Different
architectures may also differ in the degree of individual accountability which
is

feasible within them. One criticism of modern bureaucracies is, for

example, that collective decision making
punish

makes

it difficult

to reward and

bureaucrats individually.

Although we have motivated the present analysis in the context of
economic systems, our approach also has implications for the economics of

internal organizations. There are two main differences.

—29—

First, certain kinds

of externalities (such as the selection externality we pointed out earlier)
might
if

be internalized by a corporation in setting its internal rules. Second,

one internal architecture is better than another (based on whatever the

corporate criterion might be), then one might expect a corporation to adopt
the

better architecture.3° Whether a similar response arises in an economic

system is not obvious, since the theories of societal response have not
reached the same level of articulation as those of corporate response.

Moreover, the problems of the design of economic systems are so complex
that

it might not be

reasonable to expect that one would find the best of all

possible systems. The analogy to computer architecture is then suggestive:

the standard question in this case is not to find the best architecture,
since it is nearly impossible to find it, but to analyze the properties of
alternative structures, with a view to making some possible improvements.
The architecture of an economic system affects the behavior of the

organization in other ways as well; some of which have bea the subject of
extensive study outside economics. Social psychologists thave emphasized, for
example, that an individual's behavior may differ if he has participated in
the decision. making process compared to when he has been ordered to undertake

a particular task. Though these aspects of human behaviar have not
traditionally been incorporated into economic analysis, if they are important
determinants of economic behavior, e.g., of the effort exerted by individuals
or of the quality of their decision making, then they should be.
The

above discussion is by no means exhaustive. Yet, it is clear that to

all, or even a

few, of these facets simultaneously would be nearly

impossible. We have chosen, therefore, to examine a few limited aspects in

According to (A15) and (A17), a polyarchy uses the lowest cut—off point if

the other hand, uses the lowest cut—off point (see (A18)) if a > 1/2, but it
never uses the highest cut—off point. Also, it is obvious from the above
expressions that the cut—off point is raised in both systems (either

continuously, or in steps, depending on the region of a) if a goes down.

Of course, this is not the only useful typology. We discuss so other

We assume that the projects are being evaluated sequentially. The
probability of a project being accepted in a polyarchy remains the same,

however, even if the projects are being evaluated simultaneously. (An
example

of simultaneous screening is the evaluation of manuscripts by

publishers, in contrast to the sequential evaluation of maauscripts by

journal editors.) What differs in these two cases is the cost of
evaluation, and the time taken in decision making.

to focus on the

out to be the case when optImal screening rules are deterrnined In a

6.

There is not much

point

in considering portfolios which contain only

profitable projects, or only unprofitable projects. It is highly
unlikely that real world portfolIos have such features. In any event, if
there are such portfolios, and if project evaluators know

We are abstracting from the screening costs which may differ in the two
systems. See footnote 24, however, on this issue.

The last condition merely rules out those uninteresting cases in which
all projects are either accepted, or rejected.

9.

The only uncertainty in the present model is in project acceptance. See
Sah and Stiglitz (1984a) for a discussion of project uncertainty and some
of its implications.

10. We also assume that the end—points of the projects' distribution are
fixed.

11. That is:

G(x) < (>) 0, with strict inequality holding for at least

some x, implies an improvement (worsening) in the sense of first—order

prestige), so that an accepted project is more desirable than a rejected
project,

even if

the financial rewards

are independent of project

acceptance. The assumption that U's are exogenous parameters implies
that the inventors' effort is not significantly sensitive to the

parameters of their choice. Also, we assume that the

financial

rewards

are negligibly small compared to the (net) profit in a system. These
assumptions can be relaxed by
pecuniary

endogenizirig inventors' efforts and the

rewards.

17. Such a link is nearly impossible for projects which are rejected, since
it is difficult to ascertain the profit from a project which has never
been

undertaken. Even for the projects which are accepted, the actual

values are known much later in time

than when the decisions are made.

Moreover, the actual outcomes of accepted projects are often contaminated
by other factors over which

inventors of projects have little or no

control. Even then, some

dependence between pecuniary rewards to

inventors and the actual values of accepted projects. might be desirable

if monitoring costs are small and if there are no impediments to

is possible to link the rewards
the (ex—ante) observed values of projects. A full analysis of such

arbitrarily complex contracts. Also, it

incentive

schemes, however, is not attempted in the present paper.

18. If there is a possibility of significant variation ifi

the

level of

effort, then there would be one such constraint for each level of effort.

19. Depending on parameters of the function (23) and on what the magnitude of
U is, one can demarcate the space of acceptance probabilities

(p1 and p2) into regions in which one system has a higher or lower
profit than another. See Footnote 13.

20. It is assumed, however, that a firm has the information whether a project
was evaluated earlier by them or not, and the firm uses this information
to prevent a project from being evaluated more than once.

21.

Which one of

the

the possible information flows actually exists would depend

costs involved. In addition, information is often contaminated in

the process of transfer. (Not only is it generally difficult for one
individual to communicate to another all that he knows, but also thete
are incentive problems associated with whether it is in his interest to

do so). These factors are important in both polyarchies and
hierarchies. It is not obvious, therefore, that information

sharing is

more easily achieved within a bureaucracy than among business firms, as
is

sometimes believed.

22. Each one of these aspects can be generalized and can be made

endogenous. The number of observations, for example, would depend on the
cost and the technology of observation making.

23. A more complete determination of screening rules will, of course, take
into account itS impact on the incentives of inventors. For brevity, we
do not present here the details of such an analysis.

evaluating a project. We discuss the implications of evaluation costs in
Sah and Stiglitz (1984a).

25. Some aspects of this externality are parallel to

those

arising in the

of screening and sorting. Also, note that the statements
concerning screening externalities will hold in nre general models as
context

well.

26. If y1

and y2 do not overlap, i.e., if mm y1 > max

y2,

then the

decision problem disappears. This is because one can achieve perfect
selection by selecting any R in the non—overlapping region. We do not
concern ourselves with situations in which perfect laference is possible.

27. The nature of questions in which we are interested are not new. Ever
since Plato (1968) stated the problem of defining a typology of

alternative state systems, and that of comparing them, these questions

have been the centers of controversial debates in the literature on

political theory. See Popper (1950) for an appraisal of some of the
earlier literature concerning state systems. The differences between our
approach and the approaches taken in the political theory literature are
briefly sketched in Sah and Stiglitz (1984c).

28. For example, our model for determining screening rules can be extended to
include the possible effect of individuals' effort on errors, and the
ffürt—reward trade off whicth is optimal in eanh of the two systems.
Note, however, that the incentive structure may

not

always affect

individuals' performance; it may not take much more effort to make a good
decision than a bad one, but it may

take

much more abilFty.

29. See Nalebuff and Stiglitz (1983).

30. We have examined here only two

polar

architectures. More

generally,

organizations (as well as economic systems) combine hierarchical and

polyarchical features. Committees with alternative voting rules and
different information structures are simple, but important, examples.
Also note that the problem of finding the "best" architecture (given

exogenous parameters) is methodologically the san as the one of
comparing alternative architectures (which we have adopted in this
paper); though, in certain circumstances, it might be possible to use
standard optimization techniques by positing parametrically defined
architectures.
