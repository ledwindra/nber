Social Networks and Trade Liberalization

NBER Working Paper No. 10769

JEL No. A1
ABSTRACT
We discuss how social considerations can affect the desirability of trade liberalization in a
conventional small open economy model. We consider a representative family in which there are
location specific network effects from interactions with other family members, such as joint
consumption, joint emotional support, and coinsurance. The benefits an individual receives from
the network they participate in are nonlinearly related to the number of family members located in
urban and rural areas. Family members choose whether to locate in urban or rural areas and average
and marginal network benefits differ. With differential network effects in urban and rural areas, in
a model with traded urban and rural goods, free trade will no longer be the best policy. We show this
through a numerical example, and suggest that the conventional economists case for free trade may
need to be more nuanced once social considerations of this type are taken into account.

Introduction

Economists base their advocacy of free trade in small open economy models on simple analytical structures in which Ricardian gains from comparative advantage are fully
exploited under complete openness. While the literature provides many counter examples in the presence of such features as market structure, rent shifting, infant industries
and others, little or no analytical work has explored how social considerations can influence the case for free trade. This is despite an extensive sociological literature, and
anti-globalization protests based on social concerns.
Here we consider a simple formulation in which one set of social considerations is
considered which influence the desirability of free trade in such models. We consider a
two good world with separate urban and rural products both of which are traded, and
with labor as the intersectorally mobile input. We consider migration decisions between
sectors as determined not only by wage rate differences between sectors, but also by the
value to individuals of their participation in location specific (urban-rural) networks.
We have in mind a family structure in which there is value to individuals from their
interactions with other family members in the locality (urban or rural) through joint
consumption with other family members in the location, emotional support from family
members, coinsurance, and other benefits.
While these benefits are hard to quantify, and in reality are considerably more complex than in our simple treatment, we show here how an analytical representation of
2

their role can modify the conventional case for free trade. We consider a representative
family in which there are separate urban and rural network benefits available to individual family members which depend on the number of family members who choose to
reside in each location. The individual benefits from these two separate networks are
nonlinearly related to the number of family members who locate in urban and rural
areas, and average and marginal network benefits differ. We show through numerical
simulation that with differential network effects from location in urban and rural areas,
free trade will no longer be the best policy. The implication is that the conventional
economists case for free trade may need to be more nuanced once social considerations
are taken in to account.
Specifically, we first numerically solve a simple two good trade model in the absence of
network benefits for an equilibrium using assumed parameter values with and without
a tariff on the good produced in the urban sector (assumed imported). In this case,
wages are equalized between the two sectors through migration of labor, and without
network effects removal of the tariff is welfare improving. This is as in conventional
trade analysis.
Using the same model parameterization, we then introduce network benefits and
choose parameter values for the model such that the intensity of the network effect is
set higher in the rural sector through parameter selection. The presence of differential
network effects causes the wage rates in the urban and rural sectors to differ, and in the

3

case we analyze, removal of the tariff on the urban good is welfare worsening. However,
this is not a general result since the model implies that there will be an optimal tariff
rate given any parameterization of network effects, and if the comparison is between an
actual tariff rate and free trade and involves a tariff rate larger than the optimal tariff
rate, then free trade may still dominate in any particular pair wise comparison. Optimal
policy will only be free trade where network effects are symmetric across urban and rural
areas. We also assume that other instruments, such as a tax on migrating labour, are
not available.
The main point of the paper, therefore, is to argue that in the presence of differential
network effects in urban and rural areas trade liberalization can be welfare worsening.
The literature on consumption insurance in rural areas in low income countries provides
some evidence for the existence of community ties in rural areas (see Townsend (1995),
Fafchamp and Lund (2000)), and seemingly supports our analysis.

A Two Good Model with Network Effects

We consider a small open economy populated with N identical individuals, and with
two sectors with separate products and regional identities and a defined social network
operating in each. We assume rural (1) and urban (2) sectors, produce an agricultural
good (1) and a manufactured good (2) respectively using labor (n) and a fixed factor in

4

each sector. Each individual, for simplicity, owns one unit of labor. World prices for the
two goods, pw1 and pw2 , are taken as given.
In the presence of a tariff on imports, domestic prices are given by p1 = pw1 , if good
1 is exported and p2 = pw2 (1 + τ2 ), if good 2 is imported (which is what we assume as
the initial direction of trade).
The utility function for an individual who locates his/her labor in sector j we assume
is of CES form, written as
Uj = λj cρj1 + (1 − λj ) cρj2

 θρj

µ

nj j

1−θj

,

(1)

where cji is consumption of good i (= 1, 2) and nj is the number of people in sector j.
This formulation reflects the feature that individuals derive utility not only from
consumption of goods, but also from participation in the network in the region that
they choose to live in. An individual decides where to locate by comparing the utility
of locating , working and consuming in each of the two networks.
We assume, for simplicity, that the more people that are in the network the more
preferrend the outcome, but this may not be the case in practice if there are conflicts
between individuals or crowding/congestion effects. λ is the share parameter on the two
consumption goods in the CES sub-utility function defined over goods. ρ determines the
elasticity of substitution between the two goods. θ and µ are parameters which determine the strength of the network effects. In the absence of prior literature, we assume

5

parameters for this network sub-function for each sector. θj is the constant elasticity of
substitution share parameter between the network and traditional consumption benefits.
µj is an exponent which implies that average and marginal network benefits differ. nj
is the number of members of the representative family (of size N ) who locate in sector
j. For simplicity, we assume that the family is characterized by a single family.
The budget constraint individuals face if they choose to locate in sector j is
p1 cj1 + p2 cj2 = wj Lj + Rj

(2)

where p1 and p2 are domestic prices of goods 1 and 2 respectively, wj is the wage in
sector j, Lj is the amount of labor which locates in sector j, and Rj is the amount of
transfers these individuals receive both from the returns to the two fixed factors and
tariff revenues.
The two consumption goods (good 1 in the rural sector and good 2 in the urban
sector), are produced according to decreasing returns production functions which use
labor and sector specific fixed factors. These are written as
Y1 = A1 nα1 1

(3)

Y2 = A2 nα2 2 ,

(4)

where Ai and αi are productivity and share parameters in the two sectors.
An equilibrium in this model can be characterized as follows:
1. Individual who locate in sector j given prices p1 , p2 , w1 and w2 , and R, solve the
6

following utility maximization problem:
max

cj1 ,cj2

subject to:

λj cρj1

+ (1 −

λj ) cρj2

 θρj

nj j

1−θj

p1 cj1 + p2 cj2 = wj + R.

(5)
(6)

2. Labor is paid its marginal value product in each sector.
3. Transfers, R, are given by the sum of the returns to the fixed factors and tariff
revenues. For simplicity these are assumed equally divided among the population.
4. A migration condition across the two locations, U1 = U2 , is satisfied for all individuals.

In equilibrium, trade balance holds, i.e. pw1 XM1 + pw2 XM2 = 0, where XM1 and
XM2 are net imports (exports) of the two goods.

Numerical Computation of Equilibrium

Analytical comparative static analysis for this model is not feasible and so we use numerical simulation analysis to compare equilibria under free trade and in the presence
of a tariff. We numerically solve for model equilibria in the following way. N, pw1 , pw2 ,
τ1 and τ2 are taken as exogenous. Given wj and R, we solve each individual’s maximization problem assuming they locate in region j. First order conditions combined with the
budget constraint then yield demands for each consumption good, under an assumed

where XMi are net imports of the two goods. The labor market clears, that is
N = n1 + n2 .

(13)

and transfers, R, are the sum of the returns to the fixed factors and tariff revenue. We
assume for simplicity that these are equally divided among the population, so that
Rj =

In equilibrium the migration condition implies

Trade balance holds as a property of an equilibrium, that is

pw1 XM1 + pw2 XM2 = 0.

We use these conditions in a numerical optimization package (GAMS) and solve for both
tariff and free trade equilibria and compare them. We are also able to reverse solve the
model in calibration mode using the same code.

Some Numerical Examples of Welfare Worsening
Trade Liberalization

For the model set out above we have constructed some examples of welfare worsening
trade liberalization using arbitrarily chosen model parameters. We use the parameter
values set out below in an experiment in which we eliminate a tariff on imports and
compare free trade with tariff equilibrium. We do this first in the absence of network
effects. These examples only serve to make our point that social considerations can
influence the desirability of free trade, since network benefits in practice are difficult to
quantify. We leave it for later work to refine and apply our approach more concretely
to actual settings for particular economies.

Using the following exogenous parameter values
Population of individuals in the representative family :
Number of labor units per person :
Number of families :
World prices :

N = 100
L=1
1
pw1 = 1, pw2 = 1.5

Utility parameters :

ρ = 0.5, λ1 = λ2 = 0.5

Production shares :

α1 = 0.8, α2 = 0.7

Productivity parameters :
Tariff rate:

A1 = 1.3, A2 = 1
τ1 = 0, τ2 = 0.1.

The equilibrium solution for the model is that
n1 = 74.81, n2 = 25.19
U1 = U2 = 0.461,
and the remaining model solution values are
Demands :
Output :
Wages :
and Net Trade :

c11 = 0.357, c12 = 0.131, c21 = 0.357, c22 = 0.131
Y1 = 41.03, Y2 = 9.57
w1 = 0.439, w2 = 0.439
XM1 = −5.323, XM2 = 3.55.

If we eliminate the tariff and compute a free trade equilibrium solution, the corresponding
10

variables in equilibrium are

n1 = 80.72, n2 = 19.28
U1 = U2 = 0.463,
and

Demands :
Output :
Wages :
and Net Trade :

c11 = 0.333, c12 = 0.148, c21 = 0.333, c22 = 0.148
Y1 = 43.60, Y2 = 7.94
w1 = 0.432, w2 = 0.432
XM1 = −10.30, XM2 = 6.87.

In this case the demand for good 2 increases when the tariff is eliminated, whereas
that for good 1 falls with the removal of the tariff. Note that in the absence of network
effects wages are equalized in the two sectors through migration. Since utility increases
for individuals in both sectors with the removal of tariff on the urban good, trade
liberalization is unambiguously welfare improving in this case.
We next use the same set of parameter values for an experiment in which we eliminate
a tariff on imports and again compare free trade with tariff equilibrium, but now do this
in the presence of differential network effects across urban and rural areas. We find that
trade liberalization is welfare worsening in this case when network benefits are taken
into account.

11

We assume the following for the network parameters in the model parameterization

Network parameters:µ1 = 1.3, µ2 = 1.1, θ1 = θ2 = 0.5
In the tariff case (τ1 = 0, τ2 = 0.1), the model solution is now
n1 = 20.03, n2 = 79.77
U1 = U2 = 6.538,
and the remaining model variables are

Demands :

c11 = 0.430, c12 = 0.158, c21 = 0.267, c22 = 0.0.098

Output :

Y1 = 14.30, Y2 = 21.48

Wages :

w1 = 0.571, w2 = 0.31

and Net Trade :

XM1 = 15.69, XM2 = −10.46

The higher wage in the rural sector offsets the stronger network effect in the urban sector
due to the substantially larger number of people who locate in the urban sector, even
though µ1 > µ2 .
With free trade (τ1 = 0, τ2 = 0), the model solution is
n1 = 26.142, n2 = 73.588
U1 = U2 = 1.386.

12

and the remaining model variables are

Demands :

c11 = 0.40, c12 = 0.178, c21 = 0.25, c22 = 0.111

Output :

Y1 = 17.84, Y2 = 20.27

Wages :

w1 = 0.540, w2 = 0.289

Trade :

XM1 = 11.103, XM2 = −7.402

Thus in the presence of differential network effects for individuals trade liberalization
is in this case welfare worsening as there is a decrease in the utility of individuals
located in both sectors when the tariff is removed on good 2. Hence differential network
effects between rural and urban sectors imply that trade liberalization can be welfare
worsening when social considerations are take into account. If the above set of non
network parameter values is used with the same network effects in both the sectors,
trade liberalization is again beneficial.
In these computations we only compare equilibrium in the presence of an arbitrary
tariff to one under free trade. Given differntial urban rural network effects, an optimal
tariff can be computed, although we have not done that here. Free trade can thus
dominate an arbitrary tariff since the tariff chosen may greatly exceed the optimal tariff.

Conclusion

In the paper we use numerical simulation to show that when social considerations are
taken into account the conventional argument that trade liberalization is welfare improving for a small open price taking economy need not apply. This reflects the presence of
social networks in urban and rural areas that individuals may choose to join. Network
benefits create uninternalized externalities, whose differential externality benefits can be
captured through a tariff.
While simplistic, we believe our analysis is relevant to the wider debate on the social
consequences of globalization, where social factors strongly enter verbal discussion of the
desirability of free trade but are absent from the analytics of economists. More complex
formulations with positive and negative network effects are possible, and we leave these
for later elaboration. Empirical implementation of our structure may be difficult, but
this does not detract from our main point.
