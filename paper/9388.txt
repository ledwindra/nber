How Well Do Banks Manage Their Reserves?

NBER Working Paper No. 9388
December 2002
JEL No. G21, D80
ABSTRACT
In this paper we investigate how well banks manage their reserves. The optimal policy takes
into account expected foregone interest on excess reserves and penalty costs for going below
required reserves. Using a unique panel data-set on daily clearing house settlements of a crosssection of Mexican banks we estimate the deposit uncertainty banks face, and in turn their optimal
reserve behavior. The most important variables for forecasting the deposit uncertainty are the
interbank fund-transfers of the day, certain calendar dates, and the interest differential between the
money market rate and the discount rate – a measure reflecting the bank’s opportunity cost of money
holdings. For most banks the model’s prediction accord relatively well with the observed reserve
behavior of banks. The model produces reserves costs that are significantly smaller relative to the
case when reserves are set via simple rule of thumb. Furthermore, alternative motives for holding
reserves (such as liquidity and reputation effects) do not seem to be the explanation for why certain
banks hold relatively large reserves.

Introduction

Banks play a major role in facilitating the way the financial sector operates. The efficiency
with which banks utilize reserves is important for understanding not only operational banking
behavior but also for the role that banks play in the transmission mechanism. In this paper we
analyze banks’ reserve operations and quantify the extent to which their reserve management
policy is optimal – in a sense of minimizing expected reserve costs.
The reserve management problem is interesting because of the inherent asymmetry in
costs incurred by the foregone interest when the bank meets its reserve requirement and the
alternative, more expensive, case in which the bank incurs a penalty cost for having reserves
fall below the reserve requirement. A key ingredient in assessing the probability that the
reserves of a bank will fall short of its reserve requirement is the stochastic process for the
bank’s deposits and withdrawals. Given this process and some other relevant state variables
the bank’s optimal decision can be deduced. The uncertainty and therefore the resulting
reserve position at the beginning of the next day is due to the fact that certain operations
of withdrawals and deposits take place after the bank sets its overnight reserve position.
Therefore, much of our empirical effort is aimed at estimating this stochastic process. Given
our estimates of this process we derive the predicted optimal reserve positions. Based on
the latter, the actual reserve costs are compared to the estimated costs had the banks set
their reserve positions according to the model. This comparison reveals the degree to which
banks follow an optimal decision process for managing their overnight reserves and the costs
for not doing so.
The panel data set and the environment we study are quite unique. The data set contains
daily observations on the reserve positions as well as other components of the balance sheet
for all banks in Mexico during the years 1990-1991. This data set allows us to estimate
the stochastic process for deposits and withdrawals in a relatively precise way. During this
period the Mexican banking system had a very simple structure — a feature that provides a

2

laboratory environment for our research question. In contrast to the U.S. system, the central
bank in Mexico essentially served as a payment clearing house; therefore, there were no official
reserve requirements, there were no significant reputation issues such as excessive use of the
discount window, nor were there any complications arising from Wednesday settlements as
they were done every night. Moreover, the panel structure of the data allows us to address
not only the reserve behavior over time but also systematic differences in behavior across
banks. Finally, reserve management is quantitatively a significant issue. For example, during
1990 the annual reserve costs of the Mexican banking industry (equivalent to 180 million
dollars) was about 10% of the industry’s total profit. Thus reserve management could have
an important quantitative effect on banks’ overall profitability and deviation from optimal
rules could translate into large reductions in the operating profits.
We find that a good forecast of the overnight withdrawals — the key variable generating
overnight payment uncertainty — is based on a few types of intra-day operations. The
forecasts of the overnight withdrawals result in good predictions of the reserve behavior
undertaken by most banks. Overall, the model’s reserve prediction seem to accord relatively
well with observed reserve behavior. Specifically for 9 out of the 19 banks in our sample,
we find insignificant differences between the model’s predicted reserve behavior and the
reserves actually used by the banks. For some banks, the model’s predicted reserve position
results in larger costs, although those are not statistically significant. These banks engage
in many activities for which the bank is likely to have a better information set than the
econometrician. For some of the other banks, the model produces somewhat lower reserve
costs. For these banks, particularly the regional banks, the reserves are on average larger
than what the model predicts – lending some support to the idea that other factors (such
as reputation, liquidity, etc.) may govern the level of reserves. However, these alternative
motives do no seem to be statistically significant. Finally, the model prediction are quite
robust. The model produces reserves costs that are significantly smaller relative to the case
when reserves are set via simple rule of thumb.

In terms of prior work, there are numerous classical papers on optimal cash management
and the precautionary demand for money (e.g., Baumol (1952), Tobin (1958), Miller and
Orr (1966), Hausman and Sanchez-Bell (1975), Frenkel and Jovanovic (1980), Whalen
(1986)). Some recent papers examine more directly banks’ reserve policy (e.g., Cothren and
Waud (1994), Angelini (1998), Furfine (1998), Clouse and Elmendorf (1997)). Specifically,
Bartolini, Bertola, and Prati (2001) examine the effect of the ”reserve maintenance period”
on banks’ reserves and the interaction with the supply of federal funds. As in their case, our
theory emphasizes the asymmetric role minimum reserve requirements and their penalty costs
introduce into the reserve management problem. In particular, our empirical methodology
combines panel data with non-linear time series characterization for the stochastic process
for deposits and withdrawals. Our main contribution is in combining this characterization
of banks’ deposit uncertainty with a model for managing reserves to structurally examine
how uncertainty influences banks’ reserve behavior.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 models the optimization problem faced
by a typical bank. Section 3 describes the characteristics of the data set and some specific
institutional characteristics of the Mexican banking and financial sector. Section 4 describes
the estimation methodology and the empirical results. Section 5 provides conclusions.

Model

In this section we develop a model for the optimum level of reserves for a typical bank. In
Mexico, the effective reserve requirement is zero. However, a negative balance results in a
penalty at a relatively high rate. This restriction lends itself to a specification in which at
every period t, the bank has the objective of avoiding the penalty cost without incurring the
opportunity cost due to positive excess reserves represent.1 To introduce some notation, let
1

Since the Mexican system does not have the two-week Wednesday clearing mechanism the problem the
bank faces lacks any intertemporal aspect (at least as far as reserves are concerned) and is essentially a one
period problem. It can be easily shown that the multi-period minimization problem with respect to reserve
management will reduce to the one period cost minimization discussed below.

a bank start the day with a certain balance in the reserve account, yt , where for simplicity,
we eliminate the bank index i. During the day the bank performs operations in the money
and capital markets that generate incoming and outgoing payments to and from the reserve
account. We define odt as the net incoming payments.
In addition to the set of operations performed during the day, odt , there are overnight
operations affecting the balance of the account. These operations come from the settlement
of the nation-wide clearing houses, and they can be divided into two types. First, the bank
receives check deposits during the day that are cleared only overnight, z1t . Second, the
bank’s customers issue checks that are deposited at other banks, z2t . The first type of check
deposits, z1t , increases the balance of the bank’s reserve account. In spite of the fact that
these operations are cleared during the night they are perfectly known to the bank as of 5
PM – the time the bank must set its overnight reserve position. Hence, the bank can fully
anticipate the effects of z1t in setting its reserve position. Deposits at other banks, z2t , are
withdrawals, from the bank’s standpoint, and will reduce its balance account at the central
bank. Note that these operations are unknown to the bank as of 5 PM. The uncertainty
with respect to z2t prevents the bank from perfectly controlling the end-of-day balance, and
creates the random realization of its reserve balance at the beginning of next period.
Let Ω1t denote the information known to the bank by 5 PM. This information includes
the payments during the day, odt , and the check deposits z1t . Thus, Ω1t depicts the state of
the system when the window of operations affecting the reserve account is closed. Without
loss of generality, we define the position of the reserve account at 5 PM as:

y5t = yt + odt + trt

(1)

where trt is the amount the bank decides (at 5PM) to transfer to its reserve account based
on the information Ω1t . Note that trt can be negative if the bank chooses to reduce its reserve
position. Following our description, the balance at the end of the day follows,

5

yt+1 = y5t + z1t − z2t
We assume that the stochastic process z2t is drawn from a cumulative differentiable
distribution function F (·), with a corresponding probability density function f (·) – possibly
dependent on an observable vector Xt ⊂ Ω1t . The realized reserve costs are then,
Ct+1 = yt+1 rtD 1yt+1 ≥0 + |yt+1 |(rtP − rtD )1yt+1<0

(2)

The first term is the foregone interest (the overnight Repo rate, rtD ) when there are positive
reserves; the second term reflects the positive costs when the reserve position is negative, in
which case the investment opportunities at rtD has to be subtracted from the penalty costs
rtP .2

The transfer, tr∗ , that solves (5), yields the optimal position of reserves at 5 PM, y5t
.

Since rtP > rtD , the right hand side is a positive number between zero and one and there
∗
clearly exists a unique y5t
(trt∗ ) which solves (5). Note that Φ has time varying mean and

variance, µt and σt . This is in anticipation that the distribution function will depend on
an observable vector of variables Xt , and a time invariant vector of parameters θ, which we
∗
write as Φ(·|Xt , θ). Thus on any given day, the optimal position, y5t
, will therefore be a

function of rtD , rtP , θ, and Xt . Thus in estimating the model, we first estimate θ using data
on z2t and Xt and then use the first order condition to derive the predicted optimal reserve
position.

The Mexican Banking System

In this section we provide a brief description of the Mexican Banking system and the reserve
requirements banks faced during the period of our study. The analysis performed in this
paper concentrates on the years 1990 and 1991. During this period there were no major
changes in the reserve requirements of the banks.3
The Mexican financial system is composed of the Central Bank (Banco de Mexico),
commercial banks, security broker-dealer institutions, development banks and other auxiliary
institutions. Commercial banks are authorized to provide investment banking services and to
manage investment funds. Table 1 provides general characteristics of all Mexican commercial
banks as of December 1989. These characteristics are essentially constant throughout our
sample period. Within our sample period commercial banks were not required to hold
reserves at the central bank. Moreover, reserves held in the central bank paid no interest. In
3

Central Bank procedures currently curtail the use of more recent data.

7

spite of the fact that there were no statutory reserve requirements there was an explicit role
for holding a reserve account within the central bank (with a slight abuse of terminology we
will continue to refer to this account as a reserve account). These accounts, which essentially
constitute the reserve system in Mexico, are used to settle inter-bank operations such as fund
transfers, money market transactions, foreign exchange, cash deposits and withdrawals, and
the check settlement of the clearing house.
At 5 PM, banks had to decide how much money to leave at the reserve account to support
the operations generated by the settlement of the clearing house. A positive balance in the
reserve account generates a holding or opportunity cost equivalent to the current market
rate for overnight deposits. On the other hand, a short position generates a penalty cost
at a price established by the central bank’s discount rate.4 In summary, a bank has to
forecast overnight operations so that the opportunity cost of a positive end-of-day balance,
and the penalty charged for overdrafts are minimized, consistent with the model outlined in
the previous section.
The amount of excess reserves left in the reserve accounts and the cost of holding those
reserves are significant. Consequently, improvements in the management of the reserve
account can potentially generate significant cost reductions. For instance, in 1990 the reserves
balances generated a combined holding and penalty cost equivalent to about 180 million
dollars. These costs range from 3%-11% of the banks’ financial profits. Details regarding
banks profitability measures and their reserve costs are given in Table 1.

3.1

Data

The sample data comprises operations of the reserve accounts of the 19 commercial banks
that operated in the Mexican financial system. The data includes operations from January 1,
1990 to November 29, 1991. Once holidays and weekends are eliminated, there are 460 data
points for each of the 19 banks. The daily data was used to recreate, as much as possible,
4

In our sample period the daily discount rate was three times the daily equivalent of the primary auction
of a 28-day government T-Bill rate(Cetes).

8

the operational and financial picture faced by a bank when a reserve management decision
was made. The leading dimension of our panel is the time series as we have data on daily
operations for 19 banks.
The operational data was obtained from the archives of the high-value payment system of
the Mexican Central Bank. This system tracks the operations affecting the reserve account
of every bank. Using the transaction-log, we constructed time series of the operations
performed by each bank. Specifically, we constructed a time series for funds transfer (f tt ),
cash deposits and withdrawals (cdt ), tax related operations (txt ), and the deposits and
withdrawals generated by the check clearing process (z1t , z2t ). Using the beginning of day
balance, yt , and the rest of the operations during the day (f tt , cdt , txt ), we construct the
position at 5 PM. Table 2 shows the basic statistics of these variables to illustrate their
importance and volatility.
To complete the operational data, we obtained financial information relevant for the
banks’ decision. First, from historical financial databases, we obtained the time series that
characterized the overnight penalty cost rtP . The overnight opportunity cost, rtD is the daily
equivalent of the 28-day Cetes Repo Rate. Second, we obtained financial statements for
each bank to compute measures of financial and managerial performance. In particular, we
obtained the operating cost oc, the financial profits f p, and measures of liquidity and nonperforming loans for each of these banks. Detailed information about the sources of these
data sets is given in the data Appendix.

Estimation and Results

In this section we describe our empirical model and the estimation results. We start our
analysis with standard OLS estimation of the overnight deposit settlement of the clearing
house, namely estimating the process for z2t . We use these OLS results as a convenient
reference point and as means to justify the specific nonlinear system we consequently use.

9

Finally, based on the estimated process for z2t we derive the predicted optimal reserve
∗
positions at 5 PM (that is y5t
) and compare them to the actual positions held by the banks.

4.1

The Settlement of the Clearing House

The key exogenous variable in terms of generating the uncertainty banks face is z2t . We
initially estimate a separate z2t process for each of the banks in our sample. Since we do not
have an explicit model for customer’s check writing behavior, namely the exogenous variable
z2t , we simply want a good and parsimonious statistical representation for this process. We
use a log specification to ensure the positivity of z2t . We start with the following linear
relationship,

0

ln z2t = γ [1, t, CALt ] +

L
X

βl Xt−l + ut

(6)

l=0

where ut is an error term, γ is a vector multiplying a constant, a time trend t, and CALt a
vector of calendar dummy variables, βl is a k × 1 vector of coefficients, Xt is a 1 × k vector
of explanatory variables, and L is the maximal number of lags used for Xt . The vector Xt
contains the variables known to the bank by 5 PM and include: ln z2t−1 , ln z1t , f tt , cdt , txt ,
volt , where ln z1t is the log of check deposits received at the bank from other commercial
banks (the counterpart to z2t ), f tt is the net fund transfers, cdt is the net cash deposits and
withdrawals, txt is the net federal tax related operations, and volt is the volume of operations
performed during the day.
Below we provide further description of each of the variables we use and a short
explanation for how we expect each variable to effect the process ln z2t .
• Check Deposits (ln z1t ) - A bank does not know the value of the checks deposited at
other banks (ln z2t ) but it does know the value of deposits received during the day at
its own branches. The amount of deposits and withdrawals by customers is likely to
be linked, and therefore deposits should provide some information on the withdrawals
10

activity by the bank’s customers. The coefficient is expected to be positive.
• Fund Transfers (f tt ) - Interbank fund transfers are used to settle operations such as
bond purchases, foreign exchange, and many other settlements. Since many interbank
operations are a consequence of an operation requested by a customer, paid by a check,
a high positive correlation is expected between fund transfers and cleared checks.
• Cash Deposits and Withdrawals (cdt ) - A bank performs cash (currency) deposits and
withdrawals at the Central Bank, to fulfill the operational vault cash requirements of
its branches. Since a bank does not know the number of people that will go to the
branches to perform withdrawals or cash checks, it needs to forecast this demand ahead
of time. Hence, it is likely that client demand for currency is positively correlated with
the demand of checking account resources.
• Tax Collection and Disbursement (txt ) - The federal tax collection and disbursement
is done through the branches of some banks. Also, banks distribute checks for federal
payments. Thus, a positive correlation is expected between tax operations and cleared
checks.
• Calendar Dates (CALt ) - This vector contains a set of dummy variables capturing
calendar cycles when the bank expects more checks to be cleared. The bank expects
Thursdays (thut ) to have checks with larger values than other weekdays because the
settlements of primary auction of government bonds occur on that day. Similarly, days
before and after holidays generate a higher volume of operation (bht , aht ). Another
calendar effect takes place at the middle and at the end of the month (d1530t ), when
most workers get paid. Finally in December (dect ) the number of check transactions
is increased as companies pay Christmas bonuses and the monetary base expands.
We estimate equation (6) separately for each bank ignoring the panel nature of our data.
The idea is to maintain an information structure close to that available to the banks. We start
11

with the estimation of individual banks by running OLS of equation (6). We included all the
variables mentioned above with two lags for the transaction variables (ln z1t , f tt , cdt , txt )5 .
The variables that were significant for all banks (with p − value < 0.10) were the fund
transfers f tt , tax payments txt , the log of check deposits ln z1t and its first lag ln z1t−1 . Other
variables that were significant for most of the banks are the first lag of the clearing process
ln z2t−1 , the cash deposits cdt , the time trend t, and the dummy calendar for Thursdays thut .
The number of operations volt was not significant. This is an indication that it is not
the number of operations but the value of them that has an effect in the prediction of the
mean of the process. The first and second lag of the transaction variables (f tt , cdt , txt ) were
consistently insignificant. Other than the Thursdays thut calendar variable, there was no
other consistent calendar effects. An explanation of this outcome might be that the calendar
peaks are already incorporated in the other transaction variables.
In summary, only 9 (including the intercept) of the 17 proposed variables were statistically
significant in, at least, 70% of the banks, all with the expected signs. The larger set of
variables was never chosen according to the Akaike and Schwartz BIC criteria. Guided by
our desire for a parsimonious model we adopted the restricted model with 9 variables.6
The OLS residuals show that the variability in ln z2t seem to come in clusters. Further,
there is a large degree of conditional volatility with thick tails. The optimal decision (as
given by equation (5) is not only a function of the mean but also a function of the variance
of the clearing process (ln z2t ). Thus, it is useful to have a framework that can predict well
not only the conditional mean but also the conditional variance of the stochastic process.
To model the variance we use an Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic process of
order 1, denoted ARCH(1) (see Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986)). This model suggests
that large and small forecast errors appear in clusters. In this form of heteroskedasticity the
5

We also ran the regression using the credits and debits of the transaction variables (f tt , cdt , txt )
independently. For instance, using incoming and outgoing fund transfers instead of their difference. However,
this separation of the variables did not improve the R2 of the regressions.
6
We also checked whether the Repo rate, the US Dollar/Peso exchange rate and the return on Mexican
Stock Exchange had significant effect on ln z2t . These were marginally significant for a very small number
of banks and were rejected using the BIC criteria, and therefore were not included.

12

variance of the forecast error depends on the size of the preceding disturbance. Thus, the
framework for estimating ln z2t can be written as follows,

ln z2t = γ 0 [1, t, CALt ] +

L
X

βl Xt−l + ut where

l=0

ht =

E(u2t |u2t−1 )

= α0 + α1 u2t−1 .

We use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to determine the parameters of the
conditional mean and conditional variance of ln z2t . The parameter estimates of the ln z2t
process based on the conditional variance ARCH(1) specification are given in Table 3.7 The
first nine columns describe the coefficients of the conditional mean. These basically follow the
patterns found using the simple OLS regression. There are reasons for why some variables
are insignificant for some banks. The four banks that do not show a significant thut calendar
effect, are not very active in the primary auction of government bonds, and therefore do
not show a consistent peak of operations on Thursdays. Second, the four banks that do not
show a significant coefficient for the net cash deposits and withdrawals cdt have many cash
facilities – a feature that makes the transfer of cash very flexible and so this variable is less
of an indicator of future customer operations.8
The next three columns in Table 3, describe the parameter estimates of the conditional
variance (α0 and α1 ) and the p-value of a Likelihood Ratio test comparing the homoskedastic
OLS system with that of the ARCH specification. The last column provides a measure of fit
via the adjusted R2 . Table 3 shows that for 12 out of 19 cases the parameter α1 is significant.
The Likelihood Ratio (LR) test confirms that the ARCH(1) specification is significantly
different than the one without ARCH effects for almost all of the banks. Finally, to check
whether the residuals from the ARCH(1) estimation are indeed homoskedastic and are
7

We also tested higher order ARCH terms, however, they were not significant. We also experimented
with a GARCH(1, 1) specification but could not reject the ARCH(1) specification, except for banks 7 and
10 –see details in Table 3.
8
Some commercial banks operate cash facilities on behalf of the Central Bank.

13

uncorrelated over time we regressed them on a host of variables (including lagged residuals,
squared residuals, and other lagged instruments such as z1 and z2 . The homoskedasticity was
rejected for two banks; however, the inclusion of these variables directly in the estimation
did not yield significant changes. The important point is that the time varying variance, σt ,
a key variable for setting next period reserves, can be modelled as locally log-normal.
We conduct a few additional experiments. We utilized some cross-bank information in
estimating the clearing process. For each bank i, we included in addition to the variables
described above, the variables (ln z1t , f tt , cdt , txt ) of banks j 6= i. This approach reflects
the importance of cross-industry information. Presumably, the cross-industry information
available to us is not available (at least in real time) to banks. This distinction is of interest
because such information can potentially improve predicting the appropriate reserve position.
However, in spite of the richness of these data set, the adjusted R2 (not reported) did not
show any significant improvements. This result implies that cross-bank information does
not produce significant improvements in the prediction of bank i’s cash withdrawal process
ln z2t .

4.2

The Decision Process

Given the estimated process for ln z2t , we derive the optimal position of the reserve account
established in (5). Recall that the solution for the optimal transfer trt∗ , and therefore the
∗
optimal position at y5t
, is based on a log-normal specification for the random variable ln z2t .

Thus, the parameters of the density function f for ln z2t process characterize the conditional
mean µt (θ, Xt ), and the conditional variance σt2 (θ, Xt ).

for every t by solving (5):

reserve account under the assumed process for z2t . Formally, ln y5t
should equal the observed

value for ln y5t point by point. However, it is unlikely that we have the same information
set as that used by the bank, and certain variables are likely to exhibit measurement errors.
Consequently, we assume that the observed reserve position deviates from the predicted
position by υt , an i.i.d. measurement error,
∗
ln y5t = ln y5t
+ υt where υt ∼ N (µv , σv ) .

Equation(7) serves as an overidentifying restriction on our model.

(7)

In evaluating this

∗
additional moment condition we take into account the fact that the estimates of ln y5t

depend on f (θ, Xt ) which is estimated with some error.9
The results for the Wald test described by (7) are given in Table 4.10 Using the critical
χ2 value of 3.85 (the 5% significance level), there are nine banks for which the model we
specify is not rejected. If we reduce the critical value to 2.71 (the 10% significance level) only
seven banks do not reject the model. The rejection of the model by some banks makes it
evident that substantial differences can be observed across banks. To illustrate the diversity
in how well our model performs in terms of predicting banks reserves, Figures 1 and 2 plot
∗
ln y5t against ln y5t
for the best and worst case (bank 6 and bank 18) respectively. Theory

predicts the dots should be on the 45-degree line. Bank 6 in Figure 1 has a much tighter fit
in that respect.
9

To account for the standard errors induced in estimating θ, it is convenient to think of our problem as
a two stage GMM estimation procedure (see Newey (1984), Ogaki (1993)). In a nutshell, the score function
of the MLE constitute the moments corresponding to the first stage estimation of θ, while the second stage
is simply the overidentifying restriction implied by (7). Since the first stage is an exactly identified system,
and there are no parameters to estimate in the second stage, the sum of squared errors in (7) is a Wald test
distributed as a χ2 with one degree of freedom.

The υ errors, as theory suggest, are not highly autocorrelated. Using regressions υt were regressed on
two lags of υ and one lag of z1t−1 and z2t and were found not to be predictable.

Observed and Optimal Reserve Costs

Rejections of our model for reserves can be the outcome of either banks outperforming our
model or alternatively banks not following an optimal cost minimization policy. To get a
better insight of the decision process, we compare the cost incurred by each bank to the
∗
one implied by the optimal value y5t
. That is, we add the ex-post observed z1t and z2t
∗
∗
to the decision value y5t
to obtain the optimal end-of-day balance yt+1
. We then compute
∗
the daily cost implied by the optimal decision by using yt+1
in the cost function (2) and
P
∗
summing these values for the whole sample C ∗ = Tt=1 Ct+1 (yt+1
). Analogously, we compute
P
the overall costs based on the ex-post observed daily costs as C ob = Tt=1 Ct+1 (yt+1 ).

The first two columns of Table 5 provide a comparison of the cost based on the actual
∗
value yt+1 and those based on yt+1
. The third column shows the difference between the two.
∗
The costs based on y5t
outperform those based on the observed reserve positions for 7 of

the 19 cases.11 These results highlight a few issues. First, in terms of point estimates, 12
banks achieve better reserve position than is implied by the model (that is the costs based
∗
on y5t
are higher than those based y5t ). It it is quite plausible that these banks have more

information than we do. A source of this additional information could be details of wholesale
operations that bank treasurers usually know and that we cannot observe. In other words,
in some cases banks are aware of wholesale operations that will be settled by checks. These
operations are subcomponents of z2t of which we only have an aggregate measure. Second,
our model performs better in 7 banks. This outcome is an indication that some banks do not
use information efficiently or as we discuss below have some alternative objective in terms of
reserves than the one given by (4). Nonetheless, it is interesting, that in spite of the fact that
the information used in our analysis is at best equal to what the banks had at the time they
11

In an attempt to improve the model’s fit of (6) and therefore the prediction efficiency we tried several
other approaches. In particular, we tried to use the full information set increasing the number of variables
in the model to 17. The result of this exercise was an average improvement in the cost of about 0.05%.
However, this improvement did not help the model to outperform the banks reserve policy in any of the
cases in which the banks outperformed the model.

16

made their decision, our model still managed to outperform the observed costs.12 Moreover,
in all of the 7 cases that our model outperforms actual costs, the Wald test based on the
reserve decision rejects the model – indicating that analyzing the relative costs is informative
beyond the statistical evaluation of equation (7).
It should be kept in mind that the cost estimated by our model, C ∗ , is a function of the
∗
variable y5t
which in turn is estimated with some error. Based on the standard error of the

random variable C ∗ , we create a one-sided test that considers whether the observed cost C ob
is greater or equal to the estimated cost C ∗ . When we construct this test we observe that
none of the banks reject the hypothesis. That is, once standard errors are incorporated no
banks’ observed costs can be claimed to be larger than the estimated optimal costs. This in
some sense provides the strongest evidence for the claim that banks operate their reserves
policy quite well — either better than the model or statistically not more costly.
To further analyze the model’s quantitative implications for reserve costs we also compare
the model’s costs to the case when the bank follows some simple rule of thumb when setting
its reserves. We use two alternative rule of thumbs. In the first case reserves are set so
that Et [yt+1 ] = 0. In the second case reserves are based on the unconditional mean and
variance of z2t . The first rule is motivated by a ’naive’ bank that wants to set expected
reserves to zero. The second rule ignores any time variation in the mean and variance of the
clearing process. These costs are depicted in Table 5 under the columns of C ∗ (Et (yt+1 )) and
C ∗ (Ez2t ) respectively. These columns clearly demonstrate a large deterioration in reserve
costs relative to that implied by our baseline model. This shows that the optimal decision
rules imply distinct outcome relative to these simple rule of thumb and thus lending further
support for the model. Finally, the column marked panel in Table 5 shows the costs predicted
by the model when the panel’s (as oppose to individual) law of motion for ln z2t is imposed.
Again, the restrictions imposed by the panel estimation imply significant deterioration in
12

One caveat is that in spite of using rolling basis for computing the reserve costs, the parameters estimates
for ln z2t , the clearing process, are based on the whole sample. This is just a finite sample issue. Our results
are not sensitive to using sub-sample estimates for the clearing process.

average costs – 2.37 times larger than the estimated costs using bank-specific process.

4.4

Alternative Motives for Reserves

Our approach thus far considered a relative simple environment where banks care only about
the financial costs associated with reserves. The Mexican system is simpler than that of the
U.S. and there is no explicit discount window procedure. Nonetheless, one may conjecture
that reputational concerns may induce banks to hold a larger quantity of reserves than
the model would otherwise predict. For example, banks may hold more reserves than the
model imply due to other ’liquidity’ needs or to discern any problematic features in their
balance sheet such as a large fraction of non-performing loans. One indication of this is that
in general the model produces more negative events than what is actually observed. The
discrepancy can be quite large. For example, bank 18 (bank 5) produces 100 (83) negative
cases in the data while the model produces 144 (206) cases. In addition, the last two columns
of Table 4 indicate that there is some evidence that the model tends, on average, to set bank
reserves below what they in fact were. In light of this, we regress the realized excess reserves
∗
yt+1 − yt+1
on a measures of liquidity and the fraction of non performing loans (both are

defined in the data appendix).
First, we regress, in the cross-section, the excess reserves on the fraction of their nonperforming loans at the beginning of our sample. The idea is that those banks with a
larger fraction of non-performing loans would tend to hold more reserves – thus a positive
coefficient is expected. A similar argument holds with respect to liquidity. Banks with less
liquidity require more reserves and thus a negative coefficient is expected. The regression
results are reported in Table 6 Panel-A where we use for each bank its average quantities
over the sample. First, note that these results should be taken with caution as there are
only 19 banks in the cross-section. The liquidity measure has the right sign but . The
non-performing loan measure is significant and positive. Next, we use the time series and

18

relate each banks’ daily excess reserves to its non-performing loan in the previous month.13
We now run a pooled regression for the banks. Liquidity still shows up negatively, while
non-performing loans shows up positive but insignificant. Finally, we ran each bank’s excess
reserves on its liquidity and non-performing loans separately. The results (not displayed)
indicate that only five banks out of 19 have a significant positive coefficient. Moreover, of
these five banks only one, bank 16, is a bank for which the model results with lower costs
than the observed ones. In all, the evidence supporting these specific alternative motives for
holding reserves is quite weak.

4.5

Other Factors and Reserve Costs

We investigate whether the efficiency of managing reserves measured as Ciob , is correlated
with financial profits. Financial profits, f pi , are interest charged to customers net of interest
paid by the bank. The idea is that banks that are good at managing their investment
portfolio would also be good at managing reserves — hence generating a negative relationship
between f pi and Ciob . Operating costs, oci , reflect expenses incurred by a bank in performing
its regular operations, such as employee salaries. Low operating costs may be an indication
of administrative efficiency. Thus a positive correlation between oci and Ciob is an indication
that administrative efficiency is perhaps also associated with good reserve management.
We ran a cross sectional regression of the observed costs, Ciob on a constant, the financial
profits f pi , the operating cost oci , a dummy for the regional banks, the number of checking
accounts (thousands) at each bank checki , and the number of branches brani – the latter two
variables capturing some measure of size. Panel C in Table 6 shows that the variables oci
and checki are positive and significant at the 5% significance level, whereas f pi is negative
and significant at the 10% level. The negative sign on f pi is an indication that good financial
performance is associated with a low cost Ciob . Similarly, the positive sign of oci indicates
that on average banks that are have low operating costs also tend to have low reserve
13

This financial information is only available to us at a monthly frequency and we assume it is constant
throughout the month.

19

costs.14 Given the size of the cross-section, these results need to be interpreted with caution.
However, they suggest that reserve management performance is likely be correlated with
other performance measures of banks.15

5

Conclusions

We formalize banks’ reserve decision and characterize empirically, in the context of the
Mexican financial system, some of the factors that influence the reserve management
behavior. This system is unique in its simplistic institutional structure and affords an
environment that is very close to the one studied in models of optimization under uncertainty
of cash management. The data set provides a unique opportunity for investigating the banks’
reserve management behavior as it includes the daily positions in the central bank of all
private banks in the system.
We identify the intra-day variables that govern the law of motion of overnight deposits
— the uncertain component banks face in setting their reserves. Empirically it is important
to allow this process to have time-varying volatility and certain time dummies. We examine
empirically how banks set their reserves in light of this uncertainty. Statistically, none
of the banks seem to have significantly larger costs than what is predicted by the model.
This is a striking example in which economic agents do not seem to behave systematically
different than what theory would predict. We show that model leads to reserve costs that
are significantly lower than the costs that would be associated with the use of alternative
simple rule of thumb – lending further support to the model. Finally, although banks tend
to hold on average more reserves than the model predicts, there is little support that this is
due to some liquidity and reputation concerns.
14

The same regression using operating profits yields similar estimates – indicating the results with financial
profits are not merely a mechanical result.
15
An additional interesting feature arising from informal inspection of Tables 4 and 5 suggests that
geographical location may also influence reserve costs. In particular the banks which appear significantly
more efficient than the model are regional banks. That is, they do not have branches nation wide and
their headquarters are outside Mexico City. Hence, the limited geographical dispersion may be helpful in
managing the reserve account.

C = t=1 Ct+1 (yt+1 ) is the observed cost and yt+1 is the observed decision value. ∆ depicts
the difference between the cost generated by the use of the model of individual banks and the
actual cost ∆ = C ∗ − C ob . C ∗ (Eyt+1 ), describe the costs based setting the reserves according to
the previous day. C ∗ (z2t ) provides the costs based on setting reserves to the previous days’s z2t .

C ∗ (P anel) illustrate the costs based on decision rules using the optimal decision yt+1
generated by
the panel model. check depicts the number of checking accounts (in thousands) managed by each
bank.
