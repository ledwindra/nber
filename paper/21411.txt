The Contribution of Female Health to Economic Development

NBER Working Paper No. 21411

JEL No. O1
ABSTRACT
We analyze the economic consequences for less developed countries of investing in female health.
In so doing we introduce a novel micro-founded dynamic general equilibrium framework in which
parents trade off the number of children against investments in their education and in which we allow
for health-related gender differences in productivity. We show that better female health speeds up
the demographic transition and thereby the take-off toward sustained economic growth. By contrast,
male health improvements delay the transition and the take-off because ceteris paribus they raise fertility.
According to our results, investing in female health is therefore an important lever for development
policies. However, and without having to assume anti-female bias, we also show that households prefer
male health improvements over female health improvements because they imply a larger static utility
gain. This highlights the existence of a dynamic trade-off between the short-run interests of households
and long-run development goals. Our numerical analysis shows that even small changes in female
health can have a strong impact on the transition process to a higher income level in the long run. Our
results are robust with regard to a number of extensions, most notably endogenous investment in health
care.

Introduction

The interplay between gender (in)equality and economic development has received considerable attention in recent literature.1 However, a key aspect of gender inequality has
to do with health, and this has not yet been thoroughly examined.2 Generally, four channels appear to matter: (i) Healthy women are more able to participate productively in
the labor market with direct consequences for effective labor supply and hence the level
and growth of economic output. (ii) Better health increases the returns to educational
investments: This occurs both through lower morbidity, allowing for greater labor market
participation at the intensive margin, and lower mortality, affecting labor market participation at the extensive margin (Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney, 2009; Albanesi and
Olivetti, 2014). (iii) Better health of mothers directly affects the health of children through
in utero effects and the mothers’ ability to breastfeed and nourish their children in other
ways (Field et al., 2009). Female health thereby improves development prospects over the
long run through direct intergenerational transmission of human capital (cf. Bloom et al.,
2014a). (iv) Better female health may lower fertility and thus youth dependency with a
knock-on effect on female labor participation and educational investments (Bloom et al.,
2009). Lower fertility may arise as a direct consequence of improved reproductive health
through availability of contraceptives (Bailey, 2006), but it is also triggered indirectly as
a response to changes in the female opportunity costs of child rearing and changes in the
returns to education. The consequence is a swing in the quality-quantity trade-off toward
the quality of children (e.g. Galor and Weil, 2000; Soares and Falcão, 2008; de la Croix
and Vander Donckt, 2010).
In this paper we develop a micro-founded dynamic general equilibrium model that
examines some of the mechanisms by which improvements in female health can stimulate
economic development. Overlapping generations of families choose consumption, numbers
of children, and educational investments in their children. Education in turn translates
into the stock of human capital of the next generation. We integrate decision-making at
the household level into a two-sector economy, in which effective labor is either combined
with a fixed factor in the production of goods or employed within an education sector. We
solve for the dynamic general equilibrium and study the macroeconomic repercussions of
individual choices, and thereby the conditions under which the economy switches from a
low-growth regime that corresponds to a poverty trap with high fertility and no educational
investments into a modern sustained growth regime with declining fertility and increasing
educational investments. Note that we do not analyze the historical take-off to sustained

long-run growth that is associated with the industrial revolution in currently industrialized
countries. Rather we focus on contemporaneously poor countries that can benefit from
technological spillovers from the rest of the world (for an appropriate description of the
historical evolution from stagnation to growth see Galor and Weil, 2000).3
Our particular focus lies in the role of female health, which affects female labor productivity and female labor force participation for any given level of education. Two findings
motivate this focus: First, health is a crucial element of human capital and, as such, represents a central determinant of individual productivity (cf. Bloom et al., 2004; Bloom
and Canning, 2005; Prettner et al., 2013). Second, while women face a longer life span
than men, they experience higher productivity losses due to greater morbidity during their
working lives (cf. Bonilla and Rodriguez, 1993; Vos et al., 2012). Case and Paxson (2005)
recently made some advances in our understanding of this female-male health paradox by
identifying the crucial role of differences in the distribution of conditions over the sexes
during younger ages, when women suffer to a greater extent from chronic conditions that
are objectively associated with higher morbidity. For any given condition, however, males
are typically affected more severely, which explains higher rates of male mortality.
We examine how household choices vary with the level of female health and what
the implications are for macroeconomic outcomes. Specifically, we seek to understand
whether better female health contributes to higher rates of economic growth and an earlier transition from stagnation to sustained economic growth. As healthier females have
better access to the labor market (and higher earnings), raising children incurs a higher
opportunity cost even within the high-fertility regime. This tends to enhance economic
growth from technology adoption although the distinction may be insubstantial until the
take-off. More importantly, better female health facilitates the economic transition in
that it lowers the earnings threshold at which educational investments in children become
profitable. These investments then trigger both the educational and demographic transition that underlie economic development. While this suggests a decidedly positive role
for female health in economic development, an offsetting tendency exists. This is because
greater participation of healthy women in the labor market raises aggregate labor supply,
which in turn depresses earnings in the low-growth regime and, thereby, the incentive for
households to undertake investments in education. However, we show both analytically
and numerically that despite this offsetting effect, female health unambiguously speeds up
the economic transition.
We contrast these findings with the impact of improvements in male health alone, as
well as with equiproportional improvements in the health of both sexes. By a pure income
effect, male health improvements tend to increase fertility and, thereby, slow down economic growth and the progress toward economic transition. For equiproportional health
improvements for both sexes, we find that economic growth during the low-growth regime

The article by Galor and Weil (2000) laid the foundations of unified growth theory. For other contributions and extensive overviews see e.g. Kögel and Prskawetz (2001), Jones (2001), Hansen and Prescott
(2002), Galor and Moav (2002), Galor (2005), Galor and Moav (2006), Galor (2011), Doepke (2004),
Cervellati and Sunde (2005), Strulik and Weisdorf (2008), and Strulik et al. (2013).

remains unaffected, while it rises in the sustained growth regime. Strikingly, this finding
mirrors the empirical results of Cervellati and Sunde (2011), who find that health improvements foster growth of per capita income after the demographic transition but not prior to
it. Furthermore, we find that equiproportional health investments promote the transition
from low growth to sustained growth, although not to the same extent that female health
investments alone do.
Taken as a whole, our findings suggest a distinct role for development policies targeted
at female, rather than male, health improvements. Potential policies that are targeted to
female health might include the reduction of iodine deficiency, which, during pregnancy,
has a more severe negative effect on the cognitive abilities of female children than of male
children (cf. Field et al., 2009), and vaccination against human papilloma virus to prevent
cervical cancer, which is the second deadliest cancer among women in the developing world
(cf. Luca et al., 2014). While such policies may be based on female disadvantage regarding
access to health care to begin with,4 our analysis suggests an additional rationale on
development grounds: targeting female health tends to lead economies out of poverty traps
or at least to significantly accelerate progress towards an economic take-off. Furthermore,
female health tends to foster long-run growth prospects as well. However, targeting female
rather than male health comes at a lower instantaneous utility gain to the household. This
highlights a conflict between the short-term interests of utility-maximizing households and
long-run development goals (cf. Duflo, 2012).
While we understand health and differences in health across genders to be exogenous for
much of our analysis, we show in subsection 6.2 that our results are robust when allowing
for endogenous and gender-specific investments in health. Notably, we show that men
may be advantaged in terms of health investments and health outcomes as a consequence
of households seeking to maximize their net income. This result is notable insofar as we
do not have to resort to tastes or social norms to explain discrimination against women
in terms of health and health care. Adding elements of taste-based discrimination would
only strengthen our findings.
Unlike previous work that has focused on partial equilibrium or stable growth paths, we
are able to characterize the impact of gender-specific health on the full process of economic
development. This allows us to highlight the role of general equilibrium repercussions and
to explicitly calculate the timing of the economic transition. By emphasizing the role of
female health in economic development, our model bears some resemblance to the theoretical analyses in Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney (2009), Albanesi and Olivetti (2014),
de la Croix and Vander Donckt (2010), and Agénor et al. (2010). The first two of these
articles examine how fertility and educational choices at the household level depend on
maternal mortality but do not extend this analysis into a macroeconomic framework. de
la Croix and Vander Donckt (2010) consider the impact of female health, modeled as more

is biased against women, Bhalotra (2010) and Baird et al. (2011) for disproportionate mortality of girls in
the presence of economic crisis, and Bloom et al. (2001) and Self and Grabowski (2012) for evidence on
difficulties for women to access health care when they lack autonomy.

life years lived in good health, on fertility and gender-specific educational investments in
a collective household model with Nash bargaining. While they can conclude that female
health contributes to a transition to a low-fertility regime with educational investments in
both male and female children, de la Croix and Vander Donckt’s macroeconomic environment consists of an exogenous increase in wages over time. Thus, they are abstracting from
general equilibrium effects that modulate the transition. While our framework features
a simpler model of the household (although one that gives rise to similar mechanics), its
general equilibrium formulation allows a complete analysis of macroeconomic dynamics.
Furthermore, our framework allows us to explicitly calculate how gender-specific health
investments affect the timing of the economic transition.5 Finally, Agénor et al. (2010)
consider a complex household model within a general equilibrium framework. Their work
highlights the role of public infrastructure for accessing health care, thus giving the analysis a somewhat different focus. Furthermore, they concentrate on balanced growth paths,
whereas we are particularly interested in the transition process.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model,
solves for optimal choices at the household level, and sets out the market equilibrium.
Section 3 is devoted to the dynamics of the model and develops our main result regarding
the impact of female and male health on the economic transition, while Section 4 considers
policy implications. Section 5 numerically characterizes the impact of gender-specific
health on the development process. Section 6 shows that our results are robust with
respect to collective household decision making, endogenous health, and the inclusion of
physical capital, and Section 7 concludes.

The model

In this section we develop a simple analytically tractable dynamic general equilibrium
model of economic development, featuring differences in male and female health. Time
evolves discretely, and in generation t the economy is populated by Nt /2 couples formed
out of a pool of Nt individuals. We assume that males and females pair randomly after
coming of age. Each couple jointly decides on consumption, the number of children,
and the educational investments in each child. The last two decisions determine the
population growth rate and the individual human capital level, respectively, which then
jointly determine the available aggregate human capital stock of the economy in the next
generation t + 1.
The aggregate human capital stock net of the time that is spent on child rearing can
be employed in two sectors: goods production and education. Educational investments
of parents determine employment in the education sector, while aggregate consumption
5

While not analyzing explicitly the role of female health but rather the effects of a general increase in
longevity, Soares and Falcão (2008) nevertheless highlight several similar channels through which health
improvements foster the economic-demographic transition by altering female labor supply and fertility.
Similar to de la Croix and Vander Donckt (2010), their model, too, remains a partial equilibrium/household
level analysis.

determines employment in final goods production. The only input in the education sector
is teachers Lt,E , while final goods are produced by using workers Lt,Y , natural resources
of fixed supply X, and the technologies available to generation t, denoted by At (see Galor
and Weil, 2000). It is assumed that less developed countries have no research sector for
the development of new technologies, but rather adopt technologies developed in more
advanced countries. For a justification of this assumption see Jones (2002), Keller (2002),
and Ha and Howitt (2007), who show that the most developed industrialized countries
almost exclusively drive the technological frontier of the world. Following Benhabib and
Spiegel (2005), p. 941, we model the speed of technology adoption as being positively
influenced by the technological gap between the less developed countries and the technology leaders and negatively influenced by the gap in human capital. The former can be
justified by the notion that the adoption of new technologies is more likely to pay off when
the incremental outputs that can be produced by using them are larger (cf. Howitt, 2000;
Acemoglu et al., 2006), while the latter can be justified by the notion that handling new
technologies requires a certain amount of skills (cf. Nelson and Phelps, 1966).

2.1

Household choices

Consider a less developed economy populated by male-female couples whose preferences
are captured by the following utility function:
u = log (ct ) + γ log (nt ) + δ log (ē + et ) ,

(1)

where ct denotes joint adult consumption, nt refers to the number of children, et denotes
investment in the education of the offspring, and ē represents the education level that
children have without any educational investments by their parents (cf. Strulik et al.,
2013). The rationale for ē > 0 is that children acquire knowledge during childhood by
observing parents and peers. The parameters γ and δ measure the utility weight of the
number of children and their education, respectively. The budget constraint of the couple
is given by
ξm w
bt + ξf w
bt (1 − ψnt ) = ct + et nt ,

(2)

where w
bt = wt ht refers to the wage rate per unit of time, depending on the human capital
of adults, ht , and the wage rate per unit of human capital, wt .6 The parameters ξm and
ξf are measures of male and female productivity as determined by factors other than
education, in particular by gender-specific health, and ψ refers to the fraction of time
that is required for giving birth to and caring for one child. Thus, household income on
the left-hand side of the equation is composed of the husband’s and the wife’s earnings,
both not only increasing in the (common) level of human capital but also in gender6
Note that we abstract from politically, socially, and institutionally motivated gender-specific wage discrimination. Incorporating such an analysis would not change our central results as long as discrimination
was not too severe such that women were prohibited from labor market participation. However, it would
come at a substantial reduction in expositional clarity.

specific productivity as determined by gender-specific health. Because, for developing
countries, time use patterns show that the contribution of mothers to child care dwarfs the
contribution of fathers (cf. Duflo, 2012), we set the male contribution to zero and assume
that women shoulder the full burden of child care. Thus, female earnings are lowered by the
(full) amount of time ψnt required for bearing and rearing nt children. This means that the
quality-independent child costs are represented by foregone female earnings. By contrast,
the quality-dependent child costs are represented by total educational expenditure et nt on
the right-hand side of Equation (2).
The impact of health on productivity and therefore on earnings can be understood
in two ways: First, ξm and ξf may represent health-dependent labor participation in the
sense that only healthy time can be used for productive employment. According to data
from the Global Burden of Disease Study, in 1990 males and females aged 30 live about
0.11 and 0.124 life years in disability (YLD), respectively (Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation, 2013; Vos et al., 2012, p. 2184). Normalizing total time to unity, we would
then obtain ξm = 1 − Y LDm (= 0.89) and ξf = 1 − Y LDf (= 0.876). Furthermore, casestudy evidence indicates that the economic burden of disease (in terms of labor lost) at
the household level primarily falls on females (cf. Bonilla and Rodriguez, 1993). We make
the additional assumptions that child care has to be provided and that this can be done
regardless of parental health status.7 Given that child care is provided unconditionally,
this implies that available working time is 1 − ψnt , of which a share ξf is used effectively,
whereas a share 1 − ξf is lost.8
Second, ξm and ξf may represent productivity at the work place, implying that (effective) wage rates are now given by ξj w
bt , whereas male and female participation are given
by 1 and 1 − ψnt , respectively. Indeed, ample evidence shows that individual productivity
increases with health.9 While our analysis does not rely on a priori assumptions about
the ordering of ξm and ξf , the literature on the male-female health gap suggests that
ξm ≥ ξf .10 Lower female productivity may arise, for instance, due to iodine deficiency, a
problem encountered in many developing countries, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa.
As Field et al. (2009) find from microeconometric evidence, insufficient iodine intake dur7
This, obviously, rules out from our consideration very severe diseases. While we recognize that some
acute infectious diseases may, indeed, debilitate women to the extent they cannot provide child care, several
important chronic conditions (anemia, nonfatal malaria, cataract) are such that they are likely to depress
female labor supply but not their ability to provide (at least basic) child care.
8
One could argue that the provision of child care has negative utility for a woman who is sick. It can be
checked that adding
 a term −φ (1 − ξf ) ψnt to the utility function does not change our results qualitatively

as long as φ ∈ 0, φ .
9
See for example Strauss and Thomas (1998), Schultz (2002), Shastry and Weil (2003), Schultz (2005),
Bleakley (2007), Weil (2007), Bleakley (2010), Bleakley (2011), and Fink and Masiye (2012). The effects
also include health impacts during childhood that reflect on adult productivity. Recent work by Bleakley
(2007) and Bleakley (2010) identifies strong direct effects on adult productivity from childhood exposure
to hookworms and malaria, respectively. Notably, productivity increases even for a given level of schooling.
As Bleakley (2011) argues, better child health tends to raise, as a first-order effect, the quality of a given
quantity of education, whereas ensuing (optimal) changes to the quantity of education only give rise to
second-order effects.
10
As noted previously, this is also mentioned in the literature on female disadvantage with regard to
health and healthcare.

ing pregnancy lowers children’s cognitive ability and subsequent educational attainment,
in particular for girls. Notably this is true even when girls and boys receive the same
amount of schooling. In this context, ξm − ξf > 0 could be interpreted as the extent
to which maternal iodine deficiency impairs female productivity for a given quantity of
education ht (as would arise from educational spending et ).
For fertility to be nonnegative and not to exceed the amount that would induce females
to spend more time on child care than their available time budget allows, we assume that
γ ∈ (δ, ξf /ξm ) holds. Solving the couple’s utility maximization problem then yields optimal

γ−δ

At low levels of wages, w
bt ≤ γē/(δξf ψ), the couple divides household income between
consumption ct and fertility nt alone, while educational investments et are zero. The reason
is that parents prefer a corner solution in which children only learn incidentally because
income is so low that the marginal utility from consumption and fertility outweighs the
marginal benefit from educational investments over and above the basic level. However,
once wages surpass the threshold w
bt = γē/(δξf ψ), investing in their children’s education
such that et turns positive becomes optimal for parents (cf. Strulik et al., 2013). Notably,
the threshold depends on female health alone. By raising the opportunity cost of child care,
improved female health tends to skew the quality-quantity trade-off toward educational
investments rather than the number of children.
For increasing income and human capital, the model replicates a transition from high
to low fertility, that is, fertility converges from above to

where the right-hand side represents fertility in the low-growth regime. Furthermore, as
inspecting Equation (5) shows, once the income threshold for positive educational investments is surpassed, these investments rise with income, paving the way for mass education
(cf. Galor, 2005, 2011; Strulik et al., 2013). With regard to the impact of gender-specific
health on the household allocation we can now state the following11 :
11

Note that we operate under the assumption that the costs of health interventions are borne by foreign
governments or development agencies and that no cost differentials exist between male and female health
interventions. See Subsection 6.2 for an extension in which the household undertakes health investments.

8

Proposition 1. Given the level of earnings, w
bt ,
(i) consumption increases (symmetrically) with male (ξm ) and female (ξf ) health;
(ii) fertility increases (decreases) with male (female) health both in the low-growth and
in the modern growth regime and in the long-run limit; and
(iii) educational investments in the modern growth regime increase with female health and
are unaffected by male health.
Proof. Immediate from differentiation of (4), (5), and (6) with respect to ξf and ξm ,
respectively.
Improvements in male health yield an income effect that unambiguously leads to an
expansion of both consumption and the number of children. By contrast, female health
improvements yield both an income and a substitution effect. The income effect leads
again to an unambiguous expansion of consumption, but this is no longer true with regard
to the number of children. Here, the substitution effect, driven by the greater opportunity
cost of children, leads to a reduction in the number of children. While this is true even
in the low-growth regime, in the modern growth regime the reduction in fertility comes
with greater educational investments. The effect that rising male income leads to higher
fertility, while rising female income leads to lower fertility is well established empirically
(cf. Butz and Ward, 1979; Bloom et al., 2009, with the former focusing on the United
States). Note that spillover effects of female health on the human capital levels of other
household members would only strengthen our results. Furthermore, note also that all
our subsequent derivations hold true irrespective of whether households choose a fertility
rate that is above or below the replacement rate for rising income and human capital. For
models that describe an endogenous convergence toward replacement fertility in the long
run, see Strulik and Weisdorf (2008) and Strulik et al. (2013).

2.2

Population development and labor force participation

Because each couple gives birth to nt children at time t, the replacement rate of fertility
is given by nt = 2 and the adult population evolves according to
Nt+1 =

nt
Nt .
2

(7)

As far as labor market participation is concerned, we abstract from leisure and assume that
individuals inelastically supply their available time net of child rearing. While interpreting
ξm and ξf as health-dependent participation or as health-dependent productivity does
not make any difference to the household analysis and will not make a difference to the
key macroeconomic relationships summarized in the system of Equations (22)-(29), the
subsequent intermediate analysis of employment in terms of workers (Lt ) is based on the
interpretation of ξm and ξf as health-dependent labor participation. Note that for this
9

case human capital ht is homogeneous across gender so that the wage rate, w
bt , is gender
neutral, while labor supply
Nt
[ξm + ξf (1 − ψnt )]
2

Lt =

(8)

depends on health in addition to the time that women allocate to child care.
Remark 1. The productivity interpretation of ξm and ξf implies that the level of human
capital ξj ht is gender specific. Hence, (i) the wage rate ξj w
bt is now gender specific, and
(ii) labor demand and employment in terms of workers (Lt ) will now depend on the gender
composition, whereas (iii) labor supply in terms of workers is no longer health dependent.
In this case, one would have to write out Equations (8), (10), (11), (14)-(16), and (18)
in terms of aggregate human capital (Ht ). Doing so, one can easily derive wages and
earnings as (19) and (20) and the dynamic system (22)-(29), all of which apply regardless
of the particular interpretation of ξm and ξf .

2.3

Education sector

Once the income threshold for positive educational investments is surpassed, aggregate
spending on formal education is given by education expenditures per couple (et nt ) multiplied by the number of couples (Nt /2), thus amounting to

Aggregate education spending is then used to employ Lt,E teachers whose aggregate wage
bill is given by w

These teachers produce the human capital level of the next generation with a teaching
productivity per unit of human capital of η. Because the human capital level of teachers
is ht and educational resources devoted to each child are given by Lt,E /Nt+1 with Nt+1 =
nt Nt /2, we have the following equation of motion for individual human capital,

but is unrelated to male health.

being the number of workers; At ≥ 1 denoting the stock of technologies that a country has
at its disposal; X denoting natural resources of fixed supply; and α denoting the elasticity
of output with respect to human capital. This production function implies, ceteris paribus,
that an increase in human capital employed in goods production and an increase in the
technological sophistication of a country both raise output. Following Galor and Weil
(2000) and assuming that no property rights are defined on the fixed resource X (such
that its return is zero), gives the wage per unit of human capital as the average product

International technology diffusion

In specifying the diffusion of technologies from the technology leaders, i.e., countries that
are advancing the world technological frontier according to Keller (2002), we follow Benhabib and Spiegel (2005), p. 941, and assume that

where Āt and h̄t refer to the technological frontier and the human capital level in the most
advanced countries, respectively. In this formulation the gap between the average human
capital of the less developed country and that of the technology leaders, ht /h̄t , acts as
a technology adoption barrier (cf. Parente and Prescott, 1994). The faster technological
progress is in advanced countries, the faster it diffuses to less developed economies (ceteris
paribus). This can be justified by the notion that adopting new technologies is more likely
to pay off the larger the additional amount of output that can be produced by using them.
A proxy for this additional output is given by the technological gap (cf. Howitt, 2000;
Acemoglu et al., 2006). The role of the gap between human capital levels of developed
and less developed countries as a technology adoption barrier can be justified by the idea
of Nelson and Phelps (1966) that handling new technologies requires a certain amount of
skill.

Note that the low-growth regime represents a locally stable steady-state equilibrium in
which an economy is caught and cannot escape without technological progress that it
imports from the rest of the world. In this sense the latent state variable that eventually
induces a take-off is the stock of technologies in rich countries (cf. Galor and Weil, 2000,
where the latent state variable is the population size). Consider now the development
of the economy from some time t0 onward, assuming that at t0 the economy is in the
low-growth regime. Specifically, we then have

where At+1 /At = max ht /ht At /At − 1 + 1, 1 . It is sufficient for sustained wage growth
(gt > 0) that ht+1 /ht ≥ 1, i.e., human capital is nondecreasing, and At+1 /At ≥ nt /2, i.e.,

13

technological progress does not fall short of population growth, implying that the wage
rate is nondecreasing. We can then derive the following more specific sufficient conditions
for a transition from low growth to modern growth and for sustained economic growth in
the very long run.
Proposition 3. The following holds for the occurrence of a transition and for its sustainability, respectively:
(i) A transition from low growth to modern growth arises if

Proof. See Appendix A.
Within the low-growth regime the wage rate can only increase through a rising “baseline” wage per unit of human capital. This requires that technological growth At+1 /At
overcompensates population growth nt /2 under high fertility. Given that, realistically,
nt /2 > 1 in these economies, this requires that technological growth is positive and sufficiently strong as by condition (31). Assuming that technological growth abates in the
very long run, wages continue to increase unambiguously if human capital continues to
outgrow the population by a sufficient amount. Thus, considering the long-run limits of
human capital growth given in Equation (12) and fertility given in Equation (6), we find
the sufficient condition (32) for sustained long-run growth.12
We can now identify the role of female health in sustained growth and in a transition to
a modern growth regime. To this end, assume that the transition takes place at τ ≥ t0 + 1

which allows us to state our main result.
Proposition 4. Better female (male) health, that is, a higher ξf (ξm )
(i) leads to faster (slower) wage growth in the low-growth regime and in the long-run
limit and
(ii) speeds up (slows down) the transition to modern growth.
Proof. Part (i) follows immediately when inserting the low-growth and limiting values of
nt [cf. Equations (4) and (6)] and the limiting value of ht+1 /ht [cf. Equation (12)] into
(30) and taking the appropriate derivatives with respect to ξf and ξm , respectively. Part
(ii) follows immediately from Equations (35) and (36), respectively.
Economies with better female health tend to experience faster wage growth during
the low-growth regime and in the long-run limit. This is because they tend to exhibit less
downward pressure on the wage rate for an expanding population and greater accumulation
of human capital in the modern growth regime. While greater wage growth in the lowgrowth regime suggests that economic transition is taking place earlier, this is not a
foregone conclusion. The reason is that while wages grow faster within economies with
healthy females [the last term in (35)] and while these economies enter transition at a
lower wage level [the first term in brackets in (35)], they are also starting at a lower
wage level [the second term in (35)]. This is because greater female labor participation
(or productivity) initially tends to depress wages. As it turns out, the economy with
a healthier (and more productive) female labor force experiences economic take-off at an
earlier time. We note from (35) that the impact of female health on the speed to transition
decreases with the growth rate on the path to transition and increases with the time to
transition. Finally, we note that the reduction in the transition threshold is a crucial
factor. This is because when the time to transition is short, the impact of lower fertility
on the growth rate is insufficient to offset the initial reduction in the wage rate.
All of this contrasts with the impact of male health, which, by raising fertility, tends
to slow down economic development. Indeed, male health militates against an economic
transition by lowering both the initial level of wages and their growth rate.

15

We show in Section 6 that our results are robust to extensions of the model taking
account of collective household preferences, endogenous health investments, and physical
capital in the production process.

4

Policy applications

From a development policy perspective, our main result in Proposition 4 implies that
efforts toward health improvements should be targeted at women. Indeed, the model
suggests that redistributing health care from men to women may be beneficial. The
following result shows, however, that such a policy would create a conflict with the interests
of the unitary household in the short run. This argument abstracts from the justification of
the redistribution of healthcare opportunities to women based on an unequal distribution
biased against women to begin with (cf. the literature referenced in the introduction).
Proposition 5. Consider a redistribution of healthcare from men to women such that
dξf = −dξm > 0.
(i) Such a policy unambiguously raises economic growth rates throughout and speeds up
the economic transition, but
(ii) for any given wage, w
bt , it unambiguously lowers household utility, both in the lowgrowth and in the modern growth regime.
Proof. See Appendix A.
Thus, while enhancing economic growth and hastening economic transition, a redistribution of health also lowers household utility. This is true even where such a policy
fosters educational investments in the modern growth regime or induces a transition. Indeed, this follows from a revealed preference argument: Noting from the budget constraint
in Equation (2) that redistribution unambiguously lowers family income, it must be true
that the household with better male health could always mimic the allocation chosen by a
household with better female health and thereby do at least as well. Any deviation in the
allocation (i.e., the choice of a larger number of children) must then be associated with even
greater utility. We realize that this result depends on the assumption of unitary household
decision making and may well change in the presence of collective decisionmaking. This
notwithstanding, it highlights the scope for a conflict between the short-term interests
of utility-maximizing households, which may favor male health improvements, and the
long-term interests of development policies that favor female health improvements.
In many instances, health policies are not targeted at particular individuals within
the household. One may wonder then what the implications are for the pace of economic
development if women and men both benefit equally from a particular health policy.
Proposition 6. Consider an increase in the health of both sexes by a common factor
λ > 1. Such a policy
16

(i) leaves the growth rate unaffected in the low-growth regime and raises the growth rate
in the long-run limit and
(ii) speeds up economic transition.
Proof. See Appendix A.
Given the opposing effects of male and female health on growth and development it
is unclear a priori whether health improvements that affect both sexes alike promote development. Indeed, to some extent this depends on the economic regime itself. While a
proportional increase in the health of both males and females promotes growth by lowering
fertility and raising education in the modern growth regime, this is not true in the lowgrowth regime. In the absence of educational investments, proportional health improvements do not reduce fertility and thereby leave the growth rate unaffected. This result
echoes the finding of Cervellati and Sunde (2011) that the impact of health on economic
growth depends on whether the demographic transition has occurred or not. According to their analysis, health improvements, as measured by increases in life expectancy,
tend to reduce fertility after the demographic transition to the extent that population
growth slows down and per capita income growth increases. Before the transition, however, health improvements raise life expectancy but do not reduce fertility, which may even
increase slightly. Consequently, population growth increases, which in turn compromises
per capita income growth. Although the health effects in our model work through morbidity/productivity rather than mortality/life expectancy, the impact is very similar: In the
presence of a quality-quantity trade-off, female health improvements raise educational investments, and the ensuing increase in the cost of child care is enough to offset the positive
income effect of male health on fertility, which is unambiguously reduced. By contrast,
before the transition, the income effect, calling for an increase in fertility, exactly cancels
the effect from greater female opportunity cost. Whether fertility increases or decreases
ultimately depends on the distribution of health gains in the household. Thus, it is easy to
conceive that if males benefit to a larger extent, fertility does, indeed, increase. What our
analysis also shows is that health improvements common to men and women do, however,
facilitate a take-off toward sustained economic development, albeit more slowly.

5

Numerical analysis

We now illustrate the analytical results with a numerical example based on the parameter
values given in Table 1. Specifically, we consider two exercises: First, we examine the
impact of gender-specific health on the time to transition, seeking to assess the size of
the effect; second, we simulate the dynamic system as given by Equations (22) to (29),
seeking to assess the impact of gender-specific health on the overall development process.
With respect to health we rely on the data of Vos et al. (2012) reporting that at the
global level and for the year 1990 males and females aged 30 live about Y LDm = 0.11
17

and Y LDf = 0.124 life years in disability. In terms of labor participation, this implies
ξf = 0.876 and ξm = 0.89 (i.e., 45.6 and 46.3 weeks per year). We use these values for the
baseline scenario and then assess the impact of a percentage point increase in female health
in Scenario 1, a percentage point increase in male health in Scenario 2, and a percentage
point increase in the health of both sexes in Scenario 3. Note that a percentage point
increase in female and male health amounts to an increase of healthy time of a little more
than three days per year.

Table 2 presents for the baseline case and the three scenarios the pretransition outcomes
in terms of fertility, female labor force participation, economic growth, and the time to
transition. Fertility is around 4.3 children per household, a value that is reasonably well
in line with empirical evidence for developing economies. Female labor force participation
amounts to 0.272, broadly corresponding with the female participation rates reported for
India or Turkey (cf. International Labour Organization, 2012). The growth rate of 5.6%
over a time span of 25 years amounts to annual growth in the order of 0.2% and thus to
an almost stagnating economy.13 In consequence, for our baseline economy, the (latent)
time to transition amounts to 52.6 years. The percentage point improvement in female
health (Scenario 1) lowers this time by some 5 years and 4 months, which is enough to
trigger a transition after 50 years (i.e., with the third generation) rather than after 75
years (i.e., with the fourth generation) as in the baseline. In contrast, a percentage point
increase in male health (Scenario 2) raises the time to transition by about 2 and a half
years. Given our assumption of a period length of 25 years, this does not have a bearing
on the transition process. Finally, an improvement by one percentage point in the health
of both sexes reduces the time to transition by about 3 years and 1 month, which again is
enough to induce an earlier transition.
A period length of 25 years leads to rather extreme impacts of changes in health on
the transition process as it is modeled. Changes in the latent time to transition of similar
and sizable magnitude (as for example those for Scenarios 2 and 3) may either trigger
no effect (as for Scenario 2) or a change in the timing of transition by 25 years (as for
13

We assume for this experiment constant technology adoption of about 3.8% per year. In our simulation
later, technology adoption is specified according to the flexible form of Equation (21), giving rise to an
average on the same order.

18

Scenario 3). In that regard, changes in the latent time to transition are a more realistic
measure of the likely impact of health care on the transition process. Moreover, a long
period length is associated with a second problem: whether or not a health improvement
advances or delays economic transition (by a generation) is very sensitive to the level of
the initial wage w
bt0 and therefore depends crucially on the assumptions about the initial
state of the economy.
In light of these concerns we can arrive at a more robust statement about the role of
health for economic take-off by considering the following stochastic setting. Suppose the
initial conditions of the economy {At0 , Nt0 , X} are randomly drawn from a set of values


G so that they generate an initial wage w
btb0 ∈ wb , wb for which transition arises after
three periods (and three periods only) in the baseline scenario (b).14 Clearly, the range


of initial wages w1 , w1 for which transition arises after 3 periods in Scenario 1 satisfies
w1 < wb and w1 < wb (i.e., the range is shifted “downward”). Intuitively this is due to
the fact that better female health reduces the threshold wage for economic take-off.

can now be read as the probability that the improvement in female health in Scenario
1 advances the economic transition by one period (i.e., by 25 years). For our numerical
example we obtain πb1 = 0.22, which is of sizable magnitude.15
In our second exercise, we graph the development paths for human capital, population,
and income, embracing both pre- and post-transition periods. The impact of female
health improvements is shown in Figure 1. The solid blue line refers to the baseline case,
whereas the dashed red line refers to Scenario 1, i.e., an economy that experienced at the
initial time (1950) a percentage point increase in female healthy time. Both economies
start with the same population size, the same state of technology, and the same land
endowment. They follow the same path until around the year 2000 when they are still
in a low-growth regime without the accumulation of human capital [see panels a) and b)]
and very sluggish income growth [see panel f)]. The sole reason that wages grow at all
is that the technological frontier in the rest of the world grows at a constant rate such
that the distance to the frontier increases, leading to more intense technology adoption
(cf. Howitt, 2000; Acemoglu et al., 2006). Meanwhile, the human capital level in the rest

More specifically, wb := γe/ δψξfb 1 + g b
and wb := γe/ δψξfb 1 + g b
with g b as defined by

Equation (34). Thus, the lower (upper) bound corresponds to the baseline threshold wage discounted by
the growth over three (two) periods. If w
btb0 < wb , the transition would occur after four periods; if w
btb0 > wb ,
the transition would occur after two periods.
15
Similarly, we obtain πb3 = 0.126 as the probability that an equiproportional increase of health for both
genders advances economic take-off by one generation, and (in an analogous way) we obtain πb2 = 0.121
as the probability that an improvement in male health delays take-off by one generation.

of the world also grows persistently such that the gap between the human capital level of
the country under consideration and the rest of the world widens. This acts as a barrier
to technology adoption and prevents an economic take-off from occurring (cf. Nelson and
Phelps, 1966; Parente and Prescott, 1994; Benhabib and Spiegel, 2005). At the point of
take-off (for the baseline scenario this is the year 2025 and for Scenario 1 this is the year
2000), per capita income surpasses the value at which it becomes optimal for individuals
to invest in the education of their offspring. From then on parents choose to have fewer
children but to educate them better. Consequently, a fertility transition sets in and the
rate of population growth declines [see panel d)]. The resulting increase in human capital
helps to close the gap between the human capital level of the country under consideration
and the rest of the world. This in turn leads to faster technology adoption and an increase
of per capita income growth [see panels e) and f)].
In comparison with the baseline scenario we see that the benefits from female health
improvements materialize only over time, but then in an accelerating way. This is due
to diverging growth rates of human capital and income in the modern growth regime,
implying that an initial advantage is magnified. Interestingly, little perceivable difference
exists between the two economies in the “immediate” aftermath of the early transition
(i.e., over the years 2000–2025). Thus, female health improvements appear to create only
a small initial advantage in terms of slightly higher growth rates at a slightly earlier point
in time, but this effect is vastly magnified over the subsequent 50 years.
In Figure 2 we hold female health constant and simulate an increase in male health
by 1 percentage point (Scenario 2). In this case, both economies take off in the year
2025. Nevertheless, even under the modern growth regime, the higher fertility level in
Scenario 2 places a drag on income growth and the growth of human capital, causing
these economies to diverge as well. Finally, in Figure 3, we simulate an equiproportional

increase in health of both sexes (Scenario 3). Despite the earlier take-off of the economy
with better health, the difference in post-transition growth rates is rather limited, implying
that these economies do not follow dramatically divergent development paths.
We should mention that the path of development is not invariant to the sequencing of
events. If female health is improved earlier (later) than male health, the economy ends
up on a higher (lower) income trajectory. This suggests that targeted health interventions
for women are more effective for economic development the earlier they occur. In other
words, failing to act now on improving female health is likely to raise the future cost of
interventions for any given outcome.

Extensions and robustness of the results

In this section we investigate three extensions of the model and analyze whether our results
are robust to these alternative specifications. Subsection 6.1 relaxes the assumption of
unitary household preferences in favor of collective preferences, Subsection 6.2 analyzes
the implications of endogenous investments in health, and Subsection 6.3 sheds light on

Collective household preferences

Frequent arguments hold that household allocations are (empirically) better represented by
models of collective rather than unitary preferences.16 To illustrate the robustness of our
main results, this section derives the allocation under collective household preferences and
sketches out the implications of (female) health improvements. Thus, consider collective
preferences of the form

according to which each partner j = m, f derives utility from private consumption cjt
and from the number of children and their education, the latter two being public goods
within the household. The distribution function θb = θ (ξm , ξf ) is assumed to depend on
the distribution of health. This can be viewed as a reduced form of the more common
representation, where θb depends on the income distribution within the household. Naturally, we have ∂θ/∂ξm = θm ≥ 0 ≥ θf = ∂θ/∂ξf , implying that better female (male)
health tends to increase (decrease) women’s bargaining power. We allow that partners
differ in their preferences over children and their education. Similar to Rees and Riezman
(2012) we follow empirical evidence that men tend to have a stronger preference for private
consumption and the number of children as opposed to education (see e.g. Schultz, 1990;
Thomas, 1990) such that we assume δm < δf ≤ γf ≤ γm . Solving the utility maximization

only differences being that (i) aggregate household consumption ct is now split according
to the distribution rule and (ii) fertility and education as household public goods now depend on the weighted sums γ

following result is straightforward.
Proposition 7. Given the wage rate w
bt ,
(i) aggregate consumption at the household level increases with female health (ξf ), but
responds ambiguously to male health (ξm );
(ii) fertility increases (decreases) with male (female) health both in the low-growth and
in the modern growth regime and in the long-run limit;
(iii) educational investments in the modern growth regime increase (decrease) with female
(male) health;
(iv) the transition threshold decreases (increases) with female (male) health.
The direct impact of health on the household’s choices is now modified by the impact
of health on the household distribution of bargaining power. For female (male) health
improvements this implies that the preference weight on the number of children is reduced
(increased), whereas the weight on education is increased (reduced). In most cases this
simply leads to a reinforcement of the effects found for the unitary household model.
In particular, female health improvements tend to lower fertility and raise education (in
the modern regime) both directly and through the greater emphasis on education rather
than the number of children in household decision making. But two notable changes
occur: First, male health improvements now have an ambiguous impact on household
consumption. This is because the positive income effect is offset by a greater emphasis on
fertility. Second, in the modern growth regime, male health now has a negative impact on
education, because of the lower weight on education in household decision making.
The implications for the process of economic development follow in a straightforward
b f ψ)] unambiguously
way. Note first that the threshold for economic development [b
γ ē/(δξ
24

decreases with female health. This occurs both directly and indirectly through the shift
in household preferences toward the quality rather than the quantity of children. Furthermore, the economic growth rates both in the low-growth and modern growth regimes
increase with female health due to the reduction in fertility. The converse applies to male
health, where the transition threshold itself now increases with male health. It then follows
by analogy to Proposition 4 that improvements in female (male) health unambiguously
hasten (slow) the process of economic take-off.17

6.2

Endogenous health

Consider a setting in which male and female health depend on gender-specific investments
in health improvements. We conceptualize this by modifying the budget constraint
ξm,t w
bt + ξf,t w
bt (1 − ψnt ) = ct + et nt − (im + if ),

(41)

where health-dependent participation ξj,t = ξ j + ξbj (ij,t ) for j = f, m is now composed of
an exogenous part ξ and a part ξbj (ij,t ) that is amenable to health investments ij,t . We
j

also assume ξbj0 (ij,t ) ≥ 0 and ξbj00 (ij,t ) ≤ 0 for j = f, m. Maximizing utility as given by
the original utility function (1) subject to the budget constraint (41) we obtain household
consumption as

Proposition 8. For a gender-neutral health production function ξbm (i) = ξbf (i), it is optimal for the household to invest more in male health if nt > 0.
The result follows in a straightforward way as the returns to health investments in
terms of additional household earnings are greater for men than they are for women due
to their lower rate of labor participation. Notably, this finding provides a productivitybased explanation for why women are discriminated against in terms of health investments
(cf. the references in footnote 4), i.e., it does not rely on a preference bias against women.

Consumption and fertility now depend on the optimal health investments in men and
women, while education depends on the optimal health investments in women. This
additional channel implies that, in contrast to the baseline model, the fertility rate now
depends on the wage rate. The same applies to the transition threshold, which depends
on the wage rate through changes in female health investments. The following can be
shown:18
Lemma 1. (i) Male health investments increase with the wage rate, ∂im,t /∂ w
bt > 0. (ii)
Ceteris paribus, female health investments decrease with fertility, ∂if,t /∂nt < 0, and increase with the wage rate, ∂if,t /∂ w
bt > 0. (iii) If γ < ξf,t /ξm,t , female health investments increase with the wage rate when taking into account the optimal fertility response,
dif,t /dw
bt = ∂if,t /∂ w
bt + (∂if,t /∂nt ) (dnt /dw
bt ) > 0.
While the positive impact of the wage rate on the incentive to invest in male health is
readily apparent, for women this is not entirely clear, because fertility itself now responds
to wages and may, indeed, increase with the wage rate. This notwithstanding, it can
be shown that as long as women participate in the labor market (as is implied by γ <
ξf,t /ξm,t ), female health investments respond positively to an increase in the wage rate.19
With these dependencies settled, it is straightforward to see that exogenous changes
to health essentially have the same impact on the household allocation and the process
of economic development as in the model without endogenous health investments. Consider an exogenous increase in female health. While this has no impact on male health
investments, the reduction in fertility triggers complementary female health investments,
dif,t /dξ f > 0. Overall, this magnifies the impact of female health on economic growth and
the speed toward economic take-off. However, by raising fertility, an exogenous increase
in male health depresses female health investments, dif,t /dξ m < 0, implying even lower
wage growth and a greater delay in reaching transition.
We conclude this extension by noting that endogenous health investments tend to accelerate or dampen the process toward economic transition. Thus, considering an economy
that at time t0 has not yet reached the point of economic take-off, i.e., w
bt0 < γē/(δξf,t0 ψ),
and defining ηt = η (ξf,t , if,t ) × η (if,t , w
bt ) as the product of the elasticity of female health
with respect to health investments, η (ξf,t , if,t ) = ξb0 if,t /ξf,t , and the (partial) elasticity of
f

female health investments with respect to the wage rate η (if,t , w
bt ) = (∂if,t /∂ w
bt ) (w
bt /if,t ),
we propose the following.
Proposition 9. The following holds for the low-growth (pretransition) regime t ∈ [t0 , τ ]:
(i) Fertility decreases with the wage rate, if ηt ≥ (im,t + if,t ) /ct holds for t ∈ [t0 , τ ] .
b = At+1 /At > nt /2, the economy accelerates
(ii) If this is true, then for any given A

We only provide the intuition here (a formal proof is available upon request). According to (i), the impact of a wage increase on fertility is ambiguous. This is unsurprising
because both male and female health investments increase with the wage rate. While the
former drives up fertility, the latter tends to depress it. If, and only if, the impact of the
wage increase on female health, as measured by the compound elasticity η, is sufficiently
strong, does fertility decrease with the wage rate. This is more likely the lower aggregate
health investments are in relation to consumption. An underdeveloped economy for which
technology growth exceeds initial population growth such that wages grow at gt > 0 [cf.
Equation (30)] will then accelerate toward the point of take-off, τ . This is because health
improvements (for males and females) along the development path ultimately work toward
a reduction in fertility, which in turn boosts wage growth. In addition, the improvement
in female health over time continues to lower the transition threshold, implying a further
advance of the time of take-off. Conversely, if female health responds poorly to the wage
rate, health improvements along the development path may increase fertility and, thereby,
slow the transition process.
It is often argued that utility itself depends on health (see for example Grossman, 1972;
Ehrlich and Chuma, 1990; Hall and Jones, 2007; Kuhn et al., 2015; Bloom et al., 2014b;
Dalgaard and Strulik, 2014). We could capture some aspects of the utility-enhancing effect of health investments by adding a term to the utility function that increases with the
gender-specific health levels. In the absence of cross-effects with the marginal utility of
consumption, fertility, and/or educational investments, this would have no impact on our
results. The presence of cross-effects in the utility function would, however, certainly complicate the interactions between health investments and the other endogenous variables.
While there is no reason to think that this would change our central results, the explicit
modeling of this would be complicated beyond the point of analytical tractability.

6.3

Physical capital and FDI

We follow Galor and Weil (2000) in disregarding physical capital as an input in production
[cf. Equation (13)]. Indeed, we believe the assumption that most households do not hold
substantial amounts of savings is reasonable for developing countries. While capital may
play a role in the production process, such capital is then predominantly owned either by
a small class of capitalists within the country or by foreign investors. Focusing on the
latter, however, shows an interesting relationship between (productivity-related) health
improvements within a developing economy and FDI.20
We can examine this in a straightforward way by considering a production function

Yt = Ht,Y

20
Considering a fully-fledged multi-country open economy framework that allows for a detailed analysis
of capital and trade flows would complicate the model considerably. For the sake of clarity, we therefore
restrict ourselves to sketching out the main channels by which health might affect FDI flows in this section.

where Xt is now the supply of physical capital in period t.21 Assuming that the price of
capital is equal to the world-market interest rate, r, and that inputs are paid according to
their marginal product, we then obtain immediately

The following is then easily verified.22
Proposition 10. For the low-growth (pretransition) regime t ∈ [t0 , τ ], it holds that
(i) the level of capital (FDI) in each period increases with both female health (ξf ) and
male health (ξm );
(ii) the growth rate of capital (the growth rate of FDI), increases with male health, but
decreases with female health.
By increasing effective labor supply, better health, regardless of whether it is enjoyed
by females or males, raises the marginal product of capital and, therefore, triggers a greater
investment level. This result is consistent with the empirical findings of Alsan et al. (2006).
Before the transition, the growth rate of the capital stock is determined by the rate of
technical progress within the developing country and the rate of population growth. Thus,
unsurprisingly, the absolute rate of capital growth increases with male health but decreases
b > 1, the same holds for the per capita rate of capital growth.
with female health. Given A
Thus, in contrast to many of our earlier findings, female health improvements compromise
capital accumulation in the pre-transition regime.
21
We realize that this interpretation of our production function implies that technical change At is
capital augmenting. However, for our purposes this is not a crucial assumption. In fact, any specification
α
Yt = Aβt Ht,Y
Xt1−α with β > 0 would lead to a similar outcome.
22
Note that a low-growth regime obtains if the wage rate reported in Equation (45) is sufficiently low.
This is always true for At being sufficiently low.

28

In a world in which the returns on capital do not contribute to the income of the
population under study (because they accrue abroad or to a population of negligible size)
the measure to focus on is the full wage rate, which in the model with capital is given by

Accordingly, wage growth follows as

Noting that ht+1 = ht = e before the transition and recalling Equation (12), the following
is then easy to verify.
Proposition 11. As long as households do not receive capital income,
(i) male health (ξm ) has no impact on the growth and level of wages both before the
transition and in the long-run limit;
(ii) female health (ξf ) has no impact on the growth and level of wages before the transition
but enhances them in the long-run limit; furthermore, it speeds up the economic
transition.
Thus, in the presence of externally held capital, male health loses its role in the development process up to the economic transition. This result may come as a surprise, given
that health has an impact on the process of capital accumulation. With the wage rate
now determined exclusively by the state of technology and the international interest rate,
it does not affect the development process as long as most households do not participate
in the growing returns to capital. After the transition, male health improvements slow
the process of wage growth by stifling human capital growth although this effect vanishes
in the long-run limit. Similarly, female health has no impact on the level and growth of
wages before the transition takes place. Nevertheless, by lowering the transition threshold,
it still contributes to acceleration of the economic take-off. By increasing the accumulation
of human capital after the transition, female health continues to contribute to economic
growth even in the long-run.23

7

Discussion and conclusions

We have studied the impact of female versus male health investments on productivity
within a dynamic general equilibrium model of economic development with endogenous
consumption, education, and fertility. We solved the model and studied the conditions
23

We should caution, of course, that one would expect that at some point after the transition, households
would participate in the accumulation of capital, implying a change in the mechanics of growth before the
long-run limit.

29

under which the economy switches from a low-growth regime with high fertility and no
educational investments to a modern growth regime with declining fertility and increasing
educational investments. By raising female labor participation/productivity and thus the
opportunity cost of children, greater female health has a direct negative impact on fertility.
While this moderately enhances earnings growth during the low-growth phase, which is
otherwise driven by technology adoption, it also has important level effects: on the one
hand, it lowers the earnings threshold that must be met in order to initiate educational
and demographic transitions; on the other hand, it lowers the wage level. As it turns out,
however, starting from the same initial condition, an economy with better female health
will always take off at an earlier date. In contrast, by raising income at the household level,
male health improvements tend to increase fertility and thereby slow growth, the progress
toward demographic and economic transition, and the resulting economic take-off. These
analytical results are reflected in our numerical analysis as well.
From a development policy perspective, a case exists for health improvements to be
targeted at women (e.g., by reducing iodine deficiency or vaccinating against the human
papilloma virus). While this may also be justified on intra-household equity grounds, male
health improvements are more effective in promoting household utility in the short run.
This is because in societies in which males supply a greater share of their time in the labor
market, household income increases by more if men rather than women benefit from a
health-related increase in their earnings. Thus, a conflict may exist between the shortterm interests of the household with a stronger emphasis on male health and long-term
development goals with a stronger emphasis on female health. When health improvements
benefit both sexes alike, growth is only promoted when an economic-demographic transition has already taken place. Only then will the increase in educational investments
associated with better female health lead to an increase in the cost of children that overcompensates for the positive income effect on fertility. Nevertheless, economic take-off is
still sped up as long as health improvements are not disproportionately enjoyed by men.
Our main conclusion, that female health is more conducive to economic development, is
robust with respect to the introduction of collective rather than unitary household preferences, the endogeneity of health investments within the household, and the inclusion of
physical capital in the production function (FDI).
To keep the model analytically tractable and for the sake of clarity, we abstracted
from several issues that would increase the realism of the model. Apart from collective
household preferences, endogenous health investments, and FDI, where we showed that
our results are robust with respect to their inclusion, additional extensions may include i)
utility itself depends on health; ii) reductions in fertility bring about endogenous increases
in maternal health; iii) politically, socially, and institutionally motivated gender-specific
discrimination exists; iv) better male and female health comes with positive spillover
effects on other household members, contemporaneously and over time; v) in the long
run, the quality-quantity preferences might be endogenous to economic development; and
vi) health interventions do not only reduce morbidity but also mortality. However, we
30

have no reason to believe that relaxing the model’s assumptions to incorporate those
aspects would invalidate any of our results. Additional utility from health would raise
the benefits of health investments on top of their effect on economic development, while
maternal health improvements due to reductions in fertility would further reinforce our
results. We do not consider discrimination against women in the labor market or within
the household but find that discrimination against women in terms of health and health
care may result from the maximization of net household income. We do not wish to imply
that we perceive such an outcome to be desirable, or that preference-based discrimination
against women is not an issue. But taking into account additional sources of discrimination
would only reinforce our arguments unless it is so severe that it prevents female labor
force participation altogether. Positive spillover effects of gender-specific health on other
household members would change the results only if the spillover effects of male health were
greater than the spillover effects of female health, which is unlikely. Finally, the endogenous
evolution of preferences toward higher quality of children as opposed to quantity would
speed up the transition and reinforce our results.
One last limitation of our model is that it only examines the impact on labor participation, productivity, and economic growth of variations in morbidity (as opposed to
mortality). While such a channel has been identified as empirically relevant (e.g., Field
et al., 2009), it is by no means the only one. As Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney (2009) and
Albanesi and Olivetti (2014) show, reductions in maternal mortality also serve as a trigger by fostering investments in female education, which ultimately translate into greater
labor participation and lower fertility. An examination of this channel would call for an
extension of our model to incorporate gender-specific educational investments. While such
modeling may provide further insights, we speculate that this would not alter dramatically
the mechanics or the results. To some extent, the sole effect of reductions in maternal
mortality is to alter the sequence of events: In this case, investments in female education
increase before female labor participation increases. By contrast, in our case, reductions
in morbidity trigger greater female participation before they trigger greater educational
investments. In both cases, however, the joint increase in education and participation
comes with a reduction in fertility, which sets off the virtuous cycle of development. That
said, reductions in male mortality may also turn out to be conducive to economic development. As Soares and Falcão (2008) show, greater educational investments in children with
higher life expectancy, regardless of their gender, trigger a fertility decline. However, this
does not contradict our finding that by raising the opportunity cost of children, female
health improvements exert additional leverage on economic development.
Altogether, we believe that our theoretical framework could provide guidance on
household-level empirical analyses with respect to the relations between female health and
development and between female health and household income. This offers as a promising
avenue for further research.

A transition from low growth to modern growth occurs if gt > 0 for all t ≥ t0 . As is
readily checked, this holds if and only if At+1 /At > nt /2. Substituting from Equation (4),
the low-growth level of fertility gives the condition in Equation (31). Part (ii): Assume
that At+1 /At = 1 in the very long run, where the economy has reached the technological
boundary. Substituting the limit values from Equations (12) and (6) into the condition
gt ≥ 0 and taking logarithms gives the condition in Equation (32).
Proof of Proposition 5. Part (i) follows immediately from Proposition 4.

ut > u0t ⇔ γ log (nt ) − log n0t + δ log (ē + et ) − log ē + e0t > 0.

(.1)

Consider now in turn the three cases, where (a) the low-growth regime arises both pre- and
postreform, i.e., the case where w
bt = ht wt < γē/δξf ψ; (b) the modern growth regime arises
both pre- and postreform, i.e., the case where w
bt > γē/δξf ψ; and (c) the case where for
w
bt ∈ [γē/ [δ (ξf + z) ψ] , γē/δξf ψ] the regime switches from low growth to modern growth.
Case (a): As is readily checked from Equations (4) and (5), we have nt > n0t =

γ(ξm + ξf )/ [(1 + γ) (ξf + z) ψ] and et = e0t = 0, implying immediately that the second
equality in Equation (.1) holds.
Case (b): Substituting from Equations (4) and (5) the modern growth values nt and
et together with
n0t =
e0t =

(γ − δ)(ξm + ξf )w
bt
(1 + γ) [(ξf + z) ψ w
bt − ē]

we can rewrite the second inequality in Equation (.1) as
(γ − δ) {log [(ξf + z) ψ w
bt − ē] − log (ξf ψ w
bt − ē)} > 0,
which holds because the term in curly braces is positive and γ > δ by assumption.
Case (c): Substituting from Equations (4) and (5) the value nt from the low-growth
regime and et = 0 together with n0t and e0t as from Equations (.2) and (.3), we can rewrite
the second inequality in (.1) as
*
G (w
bt ) =

γ {log (γ/ξf ψ) − log (γ − δ) + log [(ξf + z) ψ − ē/w
bt ]}

+
> 0.

+δ {log (ē/δ) − log [(ξf + z) ψ w
bt − ē] + log (γ − δ)}

Gwbt < 0 for w
bt ∈ [γē/ [δ (ξf + z) ψ] , γē/δξf ψ]can be verified, implying that
G (w
bt ) ≥ G (γē/δξf ψ)
*
+
γ {log (γ/ξf ψ) − log (γ − δ) + log {(ψ/γ) [γz + (γ − δ) ξf ]}}
=
+δ {log (ē/δ) − log {(ē/δξf ) [γz + (γ − δ) ξf ]} + log (γ − δ)}
= (γ − δ) {log [γz + (γ − δ) ξf ] − log (γ − δ) − log (ξf )}
> (γ − δ) {log [(γ − δ) ξf ] − log (γ − δ) − log (ξf )} = 0,
where the second inequality follows for z

0. Hence, ut

u0t for w
bt

∈

[γē/ [δ (ξf + z) ψ] , γē/δξf ψ], which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 6. Part (i) follows immediately when recalling from Equation (30)
that the growth rate declines with nt in all regimes and increases with et in the long-run
limit and then noting from Equations (4), (6), and (12) that nt is independent of λ,
whereas limwt ht →∞ ht+1 /ht increases with λ. Part (ii) follows in analogy to Part (ii) of the
proof of Proposition 4 with the time to transition given by
ln (w
bτ /λ) − ln w
bt0 /λ1−α
∆=
ln (1 + g)



with w
bτ = γē/δξf ψ, and w
bt0 and g as defined in Equations (33) and (34), respectively.
We then have ∂∆/∂λ = −αλ−1 [ln (1 + g)]−1 < 0.
