Corporate Supply of Index Bonds

SUMMARY

This paper develops a simple theory of the supply of index bonds
by a firm,

and uses that model to examine in some detail possible

reasons for the non—existence of privately issued index bonds in the
United States.

The major elements of the theory involve the trade—off between
the tax advantages of using debt finance and the increasing risk of

bankruptcy debt finance involves. The theory is first used to examine
the

supply of nominal bonds——it is thus a theory of the debt—equity

ratio. Then the firm's optimal supply of index bonds is examined, and

the values of the firmusing the alternative debt instruments i$ compared.
In general, there is no reason to think that nominal bonds dominate
index bonds——i.e. the theory cannot explain why firms have not issued
index bonds.

The paper then turns to a number of other reasons that have been
advanced

for the non—issue of indexed bonds in the United States, such

as the tax treatment of such instruments and the argument that their
issue would saddle the firm with open—ended obligations.

CORPORATE SUPPLY OF' INDEX BONDS

Stanley Fischer*

M.I.T.

This paper develops a simple theory of the supply of index bonds by

a firm, and uses that model to examine in some deti1 possible reasons
for the non—existence of privately issued index bonds in the United States.1
In an earlier paper, I used portfolio theory and the capital asset
pricing model to study the demand for index bonds and some properties of
equilibrium in a capital market with equity assets as well as indexed and

nominal

capital.

bonds,2 and in which individuals may also own

(but nor sell) han

The major conclusions of that paper are that the equilibriur

relationship between the real yields on indexed and nominal bonds depends
on the extent to which equity and human capital are hedges against inflation3

—

the real yield on index bonds tends to be below that on nominal bonds to

the extent that real returns on equity and human capital are negatively
correlated with inflation; that, in the absence of human capital and with

no relative price uncertainty, all private lending and borrowing would
take place through indexed bonds; and that, with human capital, both types

of bonds would in general be expected to exist. I noted that the analysis
did not throw much light on the non—existence of indexed bonds in most
major capital markets.

The non—existence of privately issued indexed bonds is a phenomenon
requiring explanation for two r.ain reasons. First, the tying of contracts
to the price level is not unknown nor even especially unusual in the

United States: labor contracts, rent contracts, certain aspects çf
insurance contracts and even the prices to be paid for future delivery

of manufactured products have all been tied to the price level.4 Second,
there has been no dearth of innovation in the financial area over the years,
although those innovations taking the form of the issue of new types of
securities by existing firms —— such as the certificate of deposit and
the floating rate note —— have been undertaken mainly by banks.

The previous paper concentrated on the demand for inx bonds and
equilibrium in a market composed of lifetime —

utility—maximizing

households.

However, the most likely private issuers of index bonds are corporations.
Accordingly the emphasis in this paper is on the supply of index bonds by
firms whose assumed notivation is the maximization of their stock market value.
It is well known that in the absence of bankruptcy and the differential
tax treatment of equity returns and interest, the Nodigliani—Miller theorem5
establishes that the value of the firm is independent of its debt structure.
A simple theory of the supply of bonds, based on the existence of bankruptcy
and the tax treatment of interest as a business expense is developed in this
paper6 and used to evaluate some of the arguments typically advanced to

3

-

explain the non—existence of indexed bonds.7
The elements of the theory of the supply of index bonds are outlined

in Section I. The theory is used in Section II to examine the view that
firms should be more willing to issue index bonds the more their profits

are (positively) correlated with the price level; Section II also
presents evidence on the correlation of the profits of some American
-

corporations with the price level. Because the theory makes clear the

crucial

role of the tax treatment of indexed payments, Section III reviews

the ambiguous tax status of such payments in the United States. Section IV
considers the argument that systematic underestimation of inflation is

responsible for the non—appearance of indexed bonds. Section V briefly
reviews the argument that index bonds have not been issued because such
bonds would 3addle firms with open—ended obligations which nominal bonds

with call—clau3e protection do not. Two further explanations for non—
issuance of ..ndex bonds are considered: Section VI examines the variability
of the rate of inflation over the past twenty years; Section VII discusses
the costs of innovation and the possibility that a large—scale change in
the form of debt issues would be easier to accomplish than piecemeal

changes. Conclusions are contained in Section VIII. An appendix compares
the variability of hypothetical profit streams for sixteen U.S. firms,

constructed on the assumption that all their long term debt issues
over the period were indexed, with the variability of their actual profit
streams.

I. The Supply of Index Bonds
This section develops a theory of the supply of bonds in the context of
the capital asset pricing model,8 using a number of other simplifying assump—

4

tions. The major result of the section is that neither nominal nor
indexed bonds dominates the other; depending on the stochastic characteristics of profit streams, certain firms will have a higher stock market
value if they issue indexed bonds than if they issue nominal bonds, and
vice versa.

Assume there are only two periods, and consider a firm that has made
its investment decision in period one which will produce (uncertain) real
profits, Tr, in period two. Real profits are assumed to be distributed as:

(1) 1T=x+a(q—l)
where x is a random variable uniformly distributed on (c,d) and q is the

purchasing pcer of money (the inverse of the general price level) in period
two.9 The purchasing power of money has the simple symmetric distribution:

(2) q = 1 +
= 1 — c
The variance of q is

with probability 1/2

0 <

<1

with probability 1/2

and the purchasing po':er of money in period two

is expected to be the same as in period one.'° ote that
that profits are positively correlated

< 0 implies

with the price level, since q is the

inverse of the price level.

The firm is assumed to sell claims on its second period profits.
Initially we examine a situation in which it can sell indexed bonds and

euity. it promises to pay an amount W in real terms to holders of index
bonds, provided its profits are at least W. Such payments are
treated as business expenses.

Any amount of profits not paid out to

index bond holdars is distributed to equity holders, after payment of taxes

5

at rate t.11 If the firmts profits are less than W, it is bankrupt.
In such a cake, equity holders receive no payments. Certain fixed real
bankruptcy costs, b, are assumed to be incurred and bondholders received
either zero or Tt —

b,

whichever is greater, in the event of bankruptcy.

To summarize this discussion, let W be the real anount promised to

index bond holders. Let S be the set of x and q on which the firm is
solvent:

The elements of the theory of the supply of index bonds can now be

seen. The issue of bonds produces a tax advantage, but the core bonds are
issued, the greater the probability of bankruptcy. Thus bonds will be
issued to the point at which the tax benefit balances the expected

bankruptcy costs.13 It should be noted that in the absence of differential

treatment of interest and profit distributions no bonds would be

issued by this firm.

In the capital asset pricing model assets issued by the firm

are

valued

by the market on the basis of their expected return and the covariance of

their returns with the market return. Let

the firm's profits 11, and the return on the market portfolio, R, occurs

through the relationship of each variable to the price level)' Empirical

evidence suests that

is negatively correlated with the price level, end we shall henceforth generally
treat

follows from the requirement

Concerning ourselves now with the interior maximum, the supply of
index bonds is positively related to the maximum profits the firm expects
to earn (d) and to the tax rate on corporate profits (T), and negatively related

to the cos of bankruptcy (b). The effects of price level uncertainty on the
issue of index bonds depend on the product cL; if the firm's profits are
related to the price level in the opposite direction to which the market's

return is telated to the price level (ct<O), price uncertainty increases the

firm's issue of index bonds. If c is positive, then the firm's issue of
index bonds is reduced by price level uncertainty. Thus, it is not the sign
of the correlation of the firm's profits with inflation which affects
the amount of index bonds supplied, but rather the relationship between
the behavior of the firm's profits with inflation and the market's
return with inflation.

The supply function for index bonds (12), does nct establish whether
the firm will hava a higher value by issuin4 index bonds than by issuing no
bonds at all or by issuing (an optimal ax.ount of) nominal bonds. Clearly,
if the firm's minimum profits are positive, it will always profit by
.issuing bonds up to that minimum. Assume therefore that the firm's
minimum profits, c — nc are zero, and calculate the value of the firm
when it is purely equity financed:

aS small, or for high tax rates, or for snail c (an eventuality which is

more than plausible), it is clear that the issue of index bonds will

increase the value of the firm. There is accordingly a presuiption
that the firm will issue some index bonds

rather than be purely equity

in any case, and, under the assumptions cf the theory, there is

certainty that it will do so if c <

if the relationship between its

market return with inflation.

There remains the question of indexed versus nominal bonäs. Suppose
that the fIrm offered to pay nominal bond holders a fixed nominal amount
B in the event that its nominal profits exceed. B, and that in that event,

equity holders receive (1 —

is greater, and equity holders receive nothing.

Equation (26) tells us that when a >

and also the firm is indifferent

between issuing the two types of bonds, then an increase in the variance of
the price level leads it to issue nominal bonds, so long as

large. In turn, (27) suggests that if

and a <

is not too

0, then an increase

in the variance of the price level does not lead the firm towards the issue

of nominal bonds. The conclusion is that the effects of an increase in
uncertainty about the price level on th2 desire to issue index bonds

14

depends on the covariance of profits with the price level; if profits are
positively correlated with the price level, then an increase in the
variance of the price level tends to make a firm more likely to issue
Index bonds.

In this section we derived supply functions for indexed and nominal
bonds and showed that neither type of bond dominates the other from the

viewpoint of the maximization of the firm's stock market value. There
are situations in which a firm issuing nominal bonds will command a
greater stock market value than one issuing indexed bonds — such situations
require, given the inverse correlation between the market and the price
level, an inverse correlation between the firm's profits and the price
level —— and there are also situations in which stock market value is

higher if the firm issues indexed rather than nominal bonds. In addition,
we established, given the empiriclly negative relationship between the
market rate of return and the price level, that the greater the correlation
of a firm's profits with the price level, the more lively its stock market

value will be higher if it issues indexed ratherthan nominal bonds.
Further, the effect of increases in the variartè of the price level on
the relative attractiveness of issuing index, bonds depends on the correla—

tion between the firm's profits and the price level.

II. The Correlation of Profits with the Price Level

a higher stock market value by issuing indexed rather than nominal bonds
if their profits are positively correlated with

with an adjustment (described below) for interest payments and the

consumer price index for sixteen firms. These firms were chosen from the

industrial, public utilities, transportation and merchandising cateorics
of the Fortune 500 firms for 1964. The criterion of selection was
originally to be the largest five firms on the basis of long term debt

outstanding in 1964 in each category, subject to the firms existing in both

1954 and 1973. There are only three transportation firms because debt
issues of many

the

the most likely issuers of index bonds would be Mobil Oil. IBM and Sears.

While the most obvious feature of Table I may be that the correlation
of deviations of real profits with deviations of the price level from their
respective trends is negative for so many firms,

22

the major lesson of the

table is that there is a wide diversity of behavior of profits with respect
to the price level and that there are indeed firms that have a positive
correlation of detrended profits with the detrended price level and that,
according to the theory, might have been expected to issue index bonds.

We conclude th2t the failure of indexed bonds to appear is not due to the
fact that there are no firms whose profits are positively correlated with
t e price level.

The Tax Treatment of Index bonds
The analysis of Section I points to the tax treatment of interest

as a major determinant of the type of security issued.24 Consider two
types of long term bond that can be called "indexed interest" and "indexed

principal" bonds respectively. The indexed interest bond is redeeied at
a nominal par value known at the tire ofissue, say $1000.

It promises to

pay a fixed real rate, say 2, plus the realized rate of inflation over
the previous period at each payment date. The indexed princital bond
Is issued with a nominal par value of, say $1000, which nominal value is

increased at each payment date by the realized rate of inflation over the
preceding period and interest is paid equal to, say again, 2 of the out-

standing principal. Redeption occurs at the nominal value of the outstanding principal which has been cumulated as the price level changes,
and is for the same real value as the initial par value.

would be

treated as a business expense. The following cuotation from the Standard
25
Federal Tax Reporter makes the source of the ambiguity clear:
In reaching its determination as to.the existence of a bona
fide debtor—creditor relationsLiip upon which the payment and
deductibility of interest could be predicated, the courts have
considered such factors as: whether there was a written instrument of the debt; whether the instrument was negotiable,
had a fixed maturity date, and bore a fixed rate of interest;
•,..; and whether there was any valid business reason for the
debt.

19

The only source of ambiguity is the nention of a fixed rate of interest;

on all other ;rounds, the indexed interest qualifies as interest. Since
interest paid on floating rate notes is deductible, it would now appear
that in fact a very strong case could be made that indexed interest
should be treated as deductible, and that there is probably no t&x

obstacle to the issue of indexed interest bonds.26 However, it should be
noted that there does not appear to be any precedent precisely covering
the indexed interest case, and that the issue could only be finally
resolved by rulings applied to a proposed and not a hypothetical bond issue,
so that some uncertainty rerains.
In the case of an indexed principal bond, the tax questions concern
the treatment of the increases in principal to the lender, and also to

the borrower. It is not clear whether only the actual intercst payment
each year would be treated as interest income and the

excess

of the

repayment of r.omir.al principal at rec:rnpcion over the purchase price

would be treated as a capital gain, or -:hecher interest plus nominal

increase in principal would be treated as interest income in each year.

The general use of the realization principle would tend to favor the former

approach. If that were the case, such bonds would generally be nore
attractive to lencers than the typical nominal bond. however, if the
borrower could deduct only the interest paid in each year as a business
expense, it would find indexed principal bonds relatively unattractive.

It is also appropriate here to consider a suggestion which has

been

made that firms would be more willing to issue bonds indexed to their
own output price than bonds linked to the general price level. If their
own output price were perfectly correlated with their profits (which is the

20

behind the suggestion) it is easy to see that the model of

brief, then, it is not obvious that the tax

treatment

of indexed

bonds should deter their issue. It appears likely that indexed interest
bonds would be treated similarly to existing nominal bonds, and it is
even possible that indexed principal bonds would provide some tax

advantages to lenders. The general uncertainty concerning the tax treatment
of indexed bonds suggests that there has been little effcrt made to

clarify their tax status, which in turn suggests that it is unlikely that

the tax treatment o index bonds has held back potential issues.

the United States typically carry a call

the corporation

can repay the debt on specified terms

before maturity but after five years (in general) or ten years (for

utilities) of its existence. Thus corporations appear to be covered
against the possibility that the nominal, interest rate will fall after

their

debt is issued, and they are, of course, covered against increases

in the nominal rate. Accordingly, the call clause protects the corpora-

tion from the risk that the Interest rate and rate

of inflation will fall.

There are three points to be made in connection with the argument

that the call provisions has precluded the issuance of index bonds because
the corporation is covered against increases in nominal

clause provides protection only after five or tea years, and interest

rates can change a great deal in that period. Third, there is no reason
why index bonds should not have similar clauses creating minimut and
maximum nominal payments.

The last two points suggest strongly that the call provision is
not the explanation for the non—existence of indexed bonds.

The Variance of the Rate of Inflation
The analysis of Section I, in particular equation (23'), showed that

the benefit to the firm of issuing indexed rather than nominal bonds
would be small if the variance of the price level were small.

variance

is

itself falls as the time interval

over which the inflation rate

calculated is increased. However it is lower by an order of magnitude

than the variance of, say, the stock market rate of return,33 and it should

probably be regarded as small. In a system in which nominal bonds are,
for whatever reason, the predominant form of bond financing, and in which
innovation is not costless (see Section VII below), the inducement to
issue index bonds is small so long as the variance of the price level
is small.

Whatever the absolute magnitude of the variance of inflation, it
is clear that the periods most favorable to the issue of index bonds were

1954—58 and 1969—73. These are also of course the periods in which economists were most actively discussing indexing. Further, the variance for
1970—74 (11.792) considerably exceeds that for 1969—73 (4.2672). Thus the
recent instability of the inflation rate has created conditions siLbstantialiy

more favorable to the issue of index bonds than existed in the revious ten
years.

VII. The Costs of Innovation
The introduction of the floating rate note34 involved the issuer of the
first such note in discussion and negotiation with the Federal Reserve System

that resulted in modification of the terms of the note.35 Such negotiation
is an obvious cost of financial innovation, as are the costs involved in

listing applications. There are other costs of innovation such as the edu—
cation of the public to the advantages and disadvantages of the new instrument.36
Most of these costs are borne by the innovator and not by subsequent issuers.

27

The fact is, however, that the innovation
was carried out in the case

the floating rate note. The note was aimed at the small borrower
and thus the educational costs could be expected to be relatively high.
of

Further, the difficulties Citicorp encowitered with the Federal Reserve

System steed largely from the fact that the issue was regarded by
financial intermediaries such as savings banks as aimed directly at
their depositors,37 and it is not certain that similar interests would
be affected if an indexed bond were to be issued.

make the costs of innovation for some non—financial corporation low

enough to result in the issue of an indexed
bond. Similarly, if
proposals for reform of the mortgage system39 lead to the introduction of
indexed mortgages, the spread of indexation could thereafter be
rapid.

VIII. Conclusions
ost of the explanations usually advanced for the non—issuance of
private indexed bonds do not appear to explain the phenomenon. There
are firms
the tax

whose profits are positively correlated with the price level;

treatment

of indexed interest would probably not be adverse; the

call clause provides protection to the borrower only after a lengthy
period and a similar provision could in any case be applied in the case
of index bonds; the costs of innovations have not prevented sophisticated

innovation aimed at small lenders. There are two argents that may have

some merit. The first is that expectations of inflation by borrowers
have been systematically higher than those of lenders, however, it is
difficult to belie':e that

than

borrowers

will aE.-ays expect

more inflation

lender, or for that matter, that there are not now lenders whO

would

acept

a low real rate of interest in exchange fcr protection

against inflation. Thus, although evidence on this issue is difficult
come by, it is hard

to believe that this factor would prevent the future

emergence of index bonds. The second is that the variance
has

been low, partivularly relative to the other risks

of inflation

incurred in the

capital markets. Given this low variance, and the existence of some

of

costs

innovation, the incentive for firms to issue indexed bonds has been

small. However, the variance of inflation has recently been higher than
it was in the sixties, and increased instability of the inflation rate,
if maintained, could lead to the emergence of privately issued index
bonds.

Al

Appendix: The Variability of Hypothetical Profit Series for Sixteen
Firms Issuing indexed Bonds

Closely related to the question exai:iined in Zection II of the

correlation of a firm's detrended profits with the detrended price level,
is an issue of independent interest ——

the stability of after—interest

profits if firms were to issue indexed rather than nocinal bonds.

Table Al presents the results cf co=parisons of the variability of
hypothetical real profit streams where firms issued index bonds with the

variability of their actual real profit streams. The construction of the
hypothetical profit series is described in Section IV (the real interest

rate was 1%). Each nmina1 profit series was deflated by the CPI to give
a real profit series.

A linear trend was then fitted to each hypothetical teal profit
series and the sum of squared residuals from that series was calculated
and divided by the square of the mean of the series to give a "coefficient
of variation" of hypothetical real profits around its trend line.
identical procedure was applied to the time series for actual real
profits and the corresponding "coefficient of variation" calculated.

Table II presents tne ratio of the "coefficient of variation" for
the hypothetical real profit series to that for the actual real profit

series. It is seen from Table Al that, given the actual debt issues of
firms, the profits of the industrial firms would on the whole have
been more stable had they issued indexed debt rather than nominal debt,
while profits for the utilities would on the whole have beer. less stable.

The reasons the ratios in Table Al are not uniformly greater (less) than
unity if the corresoonding correlation of Table I is negative (positive)

avoid assuming a full set of contingent ccmmoditics, in uhich case

This is the essence of the view advanced by Kraus and Litzenberger,

the issue of only one type of bond. Our major concern, however, is to
show that neither type of bond dominates the other.

21. An exponential could not be used because profits were negative for some
firms in some years.
22. It is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate on reasons for this
negative correlation. One obvious "explanation" which may be forthcoming
is that all the results tell us is that profits fell over the late sixties
and early seventies when the rate of inflation was high. Since both
regressions treat the inflation rate as essentially constant over specified
periods, residuals will be positive in the late 60's and early 70's. This
explanation is probably statistically correct for the cases it fits but
leaves open the question of why profits fell as the rate of inflation rose.
23. Of course it is possible that the financial officers of all firms believe,
despite the evidence, that their real profits are negatively correlated
with the price level. Presumably, though, the evidence, if it stays firm,
will eventually change such beliefs.

should be adjusted for inflation but rather remain within the

26. In my previous paper on index bonds, I stated that indexed payments
would be treated as dividends, this on the basis of verbal discussion
with students of the question who were certain of the fact. On
further examination, outlined above, I now believe that indexed
interest payments would be treated as interest.
27.

The only statement other than that quoted in the text which I have
been able to find that appears to make the tax status of indexed
interest unclear is 'Thus, interest paid ... at an increased rate
for which there is no consideration, is not deductible (.162 belOw)"
Standard Federal Tax Reporter, 1974, Vol. 2, p. 19,009). Examinatiofl
of .162 (on p. 19,044) suggests that indexed interest would not be
regarded as a "gratuitous payment" (i.e. one for which there is no
consideration) and would be deductible.
