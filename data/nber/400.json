Section one examines the theoretical reasons for expecting unionism to increase job tenure. Section two develops the \"waiting time\" statistics and econometrics needed to analyze tenure and its converse, separations. Section three describes the data sets under study and presents the basic econometric analysis of the effect of unionism on tenure and separations. Section four analyzes the routes by which unionism influences the variables. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of the analysis for understanding the economic effects of unionism.\n\n",
