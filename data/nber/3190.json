The model is an augmented version of Paul Romer's (1987) reformulation of the Solow model. Unlike Romer, however, we find no evidence of an externality to capital. This finding implies nothing about the size of possible spillovers in the creation of  knowledge because in our model, causality runs exclusively from knowledge to capital.\n\n",
