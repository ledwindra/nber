ABSTRACT
Why do firm growth and exit rates decline with size? What determines the size distribution of
firms? This paper presents a theory of firm dynamics that simultaneously rationalizes the basic
facts on firm growth, exit, and size distributions. The theory emphasizes the accumulation of
industry specific human capital in response to industry specific productivity shocks. The theory
implies that firm growth and exit rates should decline faster with size, and the size distribution
should have thinner tails, in sectors that use human capital less intensively, or correspondingly,
physical capital more intensively. In line with the theory, we document substantial sectoral
heterogeneity in US firm dynamics and firm size distributions, which is well explained by
variation in physical capital intensities.

Abstract
Why do firm growth and exit rates decline with size? What determines
the size distribution of firms? This paper presents a theory of firm dynamics
that simultaneously rationalizes the basic facts on firm growth, exit, and size
distributions. The theory emphasizes the accumulation of industry specific
human capital in response to industry specific productivity shocks. The theory
implies that firm growth and exit rates should decline faster with size, and the
size distribution should have thinner tails, in sectors that use human capital
less intensively, or correspondingly, physical capital more intensively. In line
with the theory, we document substantial sectoral heterogeneity in US firm
dynamics and firm size distributions, which is well explained by variation in
physical capital intensities.

1. INTRODUCTION
Firm sizes dynamics are scale dependent: small firms grow faster than large firms
and exit rates decline with size. Scale dependence in growth and exit rates is also
systematically reflected in the size distribution of firms. In this paper we propose
an explanation of this scale dependence that relies on the response of production

decisions to the allocation and accumulation of industry specific human capital. Our
theory can simultaneously rationalize the facts on growth and exit rates as well as
the size distribution of firms. In addition, the theory implies that diﬀerences in the
importance of industry specific human capital, and therefore also physical capital,
across sectors should lead to cross-sectoral variation in the degree of scale dependence
within a sector. We present evidence from a new data-set to document these facts
for the US economy. We find that, as implied by our theory, US sectors with larger
physical capital shares exhibit significantly more scale dependence in firms dynamics
and size distributions.
A large literature beginning with Gibrat (1931) has examined the size distribution
of firms. Figure 1 illustrates what we mean by scale dependence in the size distribution
of firms by comparing the densities of establishment sizes (employment at operations
at a single location) and enterprises (employment at operations under common ownership or control) for the US economy in 2000 to a commonly used benchmark: a
Pareto distribution with shape coeﬃcient one (see, for example, Axtell (2001)). The
Pareto distribution is scale independent in the sense that the distribution is invariant
to truncation of the left tail. The figure shows that the enterprise and establishment
size distributions are similar, reflecting the fact that only the very largest enterprises
possess more than a single establishment. Importantly, both distributions have thinner tails than the Pareto benchmark: there is scale dependence in the size distribution
of firms. In Figure 2, we present these data in a diﬀerent format in order to emphasize
the right tail of the distribution. If production units are distributed according to a
Pareto distribution, the logarithm of the share of production units greater than a
particular employment size varies linearly with the logarithm of employment. If the
Pareto distribution has a shape coeﬃcient of one, the slope of the line is minus one.
If, however, the tails of the actual distribution are thinner than the tails of a Pareto
distribution, as in Figure 1, the relationship is concave and not linear.1
We interpret the similarity between both curves in Figure 2 as evidence that the
1

In Figure 2 one can see that the distributions of enterprises and establishments are similar
for units with less than 400 employees reflecting the fact that most enterprises are formed by one
establishment. The curve for establishments is clearly concave, as is the one for enterprises although
at a larger scale. The latter finding is surprising in light of the commonly held view that the
distribution of enterprises is well described by a Pareto distribution with coeﬃcient one.

2

same economic forces determine the size of establishment and enterprises. In Figure
2 we include data for enterprises with close to one million employees to highlight the
previous statement. Hence, in what follows, we suppress the distinction and refer to
production units simply as firms. Nevertheless, the theory we develop below refers to
the technology of a single production unit and does not address questions of ownership
or control. Consequently throughout the paper we focus solely on establishment data.

Firm dynamics are also scale dependent. For example, it is well-known that small
firms grow faster than large firms, at least when attention is restricted to those firms
that remain in operation.2 This is illustrated in Figure 3 which plots growth rates
by firm size for the US over both one and ten year intervals. This figure shows that
the diﬀerence in growth rates between small and large firms can be as large as twenty
per-cent within a year, and that the accumulated eﬀect of this pattern over a decade
leads to diﬀerences of more than one-hundred per-cent between small and large firms.
2
This fact was most forcefully demonstrated by Mansfield (1962) in his study of firms in the steel,
petroleum, tire and automobile industries. More recent work by Hall (1987) and Evans (1987a,b)
using data on firms, and by Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1989a,b) on manufacturing plants, has
confirmed this finding. See also the surveys by Scherer 1980, Geroski 1995, Sutton 1997, and Caves
1998, who document the robustness of these results across time, industries and countries.

3

Moreover, this scale dependence in growth rates is not limited to the smallest firms,
and is significant throughout the size distribution.
In a typical period, a substantial fraction of production units turn over: some units
exit, while new ones are created. Mansfield (1962) was one of the first to emphasize
the importance of turnover and to find scale dependence in exit rates: small firms are
more likely to exit than large firms. This scale dependence in exit rates is illustrated
in Figure 4 which follows the cohort of firms that exited between 1995 and 1996 in
the years leading up to their death. Several features in this figure should be noted.
First, exit rates decline substantially with size, even for firms with more than 1000
employees. Second, there is no evidence of the “Shadow of Death”: firms declining
in size in the years leading up to their death (Griliches and Regev 1995). There is,
however, strong evidence that recent entrants have higher exit rates as illustrated by
the increased mass of small firms as they approach their exit date. This suggests that
selection is important for small young firms, but not for medium and large ones.

Figures 1 through 4 illustrate the scale dependence in firm dynamics and size distributions for the US over the 1990s. However, scale dependence has also been documented over diﬀerent time periods, sectors, and countries. This is surprising given
4

the enormous diversity of institutions, market structures, and technology. The robustness of these facts demands a theory that emphasizes forces common to a variety
of circumstances and sectors. Moreover, it requires a theory where these facts survive
aggregation and are consistent with aggregate evidence.
To address these facts, we propose an aggregate theory of firm dynamics based on
the accumulation of industry specific human capital. We present a stochastic growth
model with multiple goods. The set of goods in the economy is divided into subgroups that we call sectors. Each sector is in turn formed by a collection of goods that
we call industries. Firms operate in only one industry and hire labor and industry
specific human and physical capital. As long as technology exhibits diminishing
returns to human capital at the firm level, and this is preserved by aggregation within
an industry, an abundance of human capital leads to low rates of return and slower
accumulation of human capital. Conversely, if the stock of the human capital is
relatively low, rates of return are high and accumulation is fast. This process, which
is at the heart of the resource allocation mechanism in the economy, leads to mean
reversion in the stock of industry specific human capital. As long as firms respond
monotonically to fluctuations in factor prices driven by the stock of human capital,
mean reversion in these stocks leads to mean reversion in firm sizes. This results in
small firms growing faster than large firms.
The same process also implies that exit rates decline with size. To see this, note
that, given the level of employment in the industry, increases in average firm sizes
imply that some firms exit. The extent to which employment in the industry varies
depends on the degree of substitutability in consumption determined by preferences.
As long as the degree of substitutability is not too large, employment at the industry
level does not increase enough to oﬀset the larger firm sizes, and firms exit. Since
small firms grow faster than large firms, the exit rate is largest for small firms: scale
dependence in exit rates. We can then combine the implications of the model for
growth and exit to show that in the long run the distribution of firm sizes in a
sector converges to an invariant distribution that has thinner tails than the Pareto
distribution with coeﬃcient one.
The driving force behind all of these results is the accumulation of industry specific
human capital. As a result, the mechanism is robust to a variety of diﬀerent environ-

5

ments. To establish this, we also consider diﬀerent production technologies, within
industry firm heterogeneity, alternative mechanisms for the accumulation of human
capital such as learning by doing, and diﬀerences in the form of product market
competition.
The emphasis on the accumulation and allocation of specific human capital implies
that firm growth and exit rates should decline faster with size in sectors that use human capital less intensively. In turn, this implies that the tails of the size distribution
of firms should be thinner the smaller the human capital share. The rate of accumulation of industry specific human capital is tied to industry production either because
the same factors of production are used to generate new industry specific knowledge,
or because past production aﬀect the stock of this knowledge directly through learning by doing. The elasticity of factor prices to factor stocks is positively related to the
share of the factor in production. These prices in turn determine the accumulation
of industry specific factors and therefore the degree of mean reversion. Hence, the
degree of mean reversion decreases with human capital intensity, just as in the neoclassical growth model the speed of convergence decreases with the physical capital
share. Unlike human capital, physical capital investments are tied to production in
a wide variety of sectors that diﬀuses this mechanism. We show that the process of
entry and exit of firms ensures that industry production will display constant returns
to scale, and so physical capital intensities are negatively related to human capital
intensities. This implies that the intensity of physical capital in production is positively related to the degree of mean reversion in human capital and, hence, to the
degree of mean reversion in firm sizes.
We assess the relationship between capital shares and firm scale dependence using
a new data-set commissioned from the US Census Bureau on firm growth and exit
rates, as well as firm size distributions, for very fine size categories and 2 digit SIC
sectors. We first test the implication on growth rates and show that, as predicted by
the theory, there is a positive and significant relationship between scale dependence
in growth rates and physical capital shares. We then proceed to show that this
same relationship is reflected in exit rates and in significant diﬀerences in the size
distribution of firms across sectors. The diﬀerences are large. For example, in order
to make the size distribution of firms in the physical capital intensive manufacturing

6

sector conform to the size distribution of firms in the labor intensive educational
services sector, we would need to take roughly three million employees (about twenty
per-cent of total manufacturing employment) from medium size manufacturing firms
(between 50 and 1000 employees), and reallocate two million to very large firms and
one million to very small firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to make use of detailed firm size data for the entire non-farm private sector. This
allows us to uncover these novel empirical regularities predicted by our theory.3
In contrast to our approach, most recent theoretical attempts to explain the size
distribution of firms have focused on particular dimensions of the dynamics of firms in
an industry assuming elastically supplied factors of production. Another characteristic of most of these frameworks is that they generate scale dependence via selection
mechanisms: unsuccessful firms decline and exit. In Jovanovic (1982), this selection
occurs as firms learn about their productivity, while in Hopenhayn (1992), Ericson
and Pakes (1995) and Luttmer (2004) a sequence of bad productivity shocks leads
firms to exit. In Kortum and Klette (2003), it occurs as firms add and subtract
product lines in response to their own and competitors’ investments in research and
development. We acknowledge that these type of eﬀects may be important for small
firms, but we believe that they may be less relevant for the scale dependence observed
across medium sized and large firms.
Another mechanism that has its main impact on small firms is the presence of imperfections in financial markets as in Cabral and Mata (2003), Clementi and Hopenhayn (2002), Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2002) and Cooley and Quadrini (2001).
Cabral and Mata (2003) present evidence that the size distribution of a cohort of surviving firms shifts to the right and approaches a log-normal distribution over time.
They read this as support for the existence of financial constraints on small firms.
However, our model is also consistent with this finding. Since small firms grow faster
than large firms, and enter more in absolute terms, following a cohort of surviving
3

Relatively little work has examined cross-industry diﬀerences in firm sizes. In terms of firm
growth rates, Audretsch et al (2002) found that Gibrat’s Law is a better approximation for the
Dutch services sector than it is for the manufacturing sector. In terms of entry and exit, Geroski
(1983) found that gross entry and exit rates of firms are positively correlated across industries, while
Geroski and Schwalbach (1991) found that turnover rankings were common across countries. Orr
(1974), Gorecki (1976), Hause and Du Rietz (1984) and MacDonald (1986) all found that firm exit
rates were negatively related to measures of physical capital intensity by industry.

firms over time results in distributions where the mass of firms shifts to the right.
As emphasized by Cooley and Quadrini (2001) both age and size eﬀects are independently important; we focus mostly on the latter. Other models, for example Lucas
(1978) and Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2004), produce a size distribution for firms
that inherits the properties of the distribution of managerial ability in the population.
In contrast to all of these mechanisms, our model focuses upon the specificity of
human capital in an industry. Many of the mechanisms in the literature undoubtedly
contribute towards an explanation of firm dynamics. This paper shows, we believe,
that the accumulation of industry specific human capital matters too.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops our theory in
detail for the case in which firms act competitively and derives the key empirical
predictions of our theory. A number of extensions, designed to show the robustness
of our mechanism and its predictions to changes in the institutional environment, are
presented in Section 3, along with a discussion of this link between our theory and
the empirical work on specific human capital by Kambourov and Manovskii (2002).
Section 4 describes our data, and presents results that show that firm growth and
exit rates, as well as the firm size distribution, vary with physical capital shares in
precisely the way predicted by our theory. Section 5 concludes.
2. THE MODEL
We present a stochastic dynamic aggregate model in which firms are perfectly
competitive. Labor is mobile across all industries, while both physical and human
capital are specific to each industry. The model of the firm is standard: fixed costs
plus increasing marginal costs of production imply a U-shaped average cost curve,
while free entry and exit of firms ensures that all firms in an industry operate at the
bottom of their average cost curves. As the focus is upon the allocation of factors
across firms and industries, the demand side of the model is kept as simple as possible
by assuming logarithmic preferences. This assumption, combined with Cobb-Douglas
production functions and log-linear depreciation, ensures that we are able to solve
the entire model in closed form.

2.1 Households
The economy is populated by a unit measure of identical small households. At
the beginning of time, the household has N0 members, and over time the number of
members of the household Nt grows exogenously at rate gN . Households do not value
leisure and order their preferences over state contingent consumption streams {Ct }
of the single final good according to

where δ is the discount factor of the household, and E0 is an expectation operator
conditioned on information available to the household at the beginning of time. This
function reflects the fact that at any point in time, each of the Nt members of the
household consumes an equal share of the households consumption bundle, and that
the household as a whole sums the valuations of each of its members.
The household produces the final good by combining quantities of J diﬀerent intermediate goods {Qtj } according to the constant returns to scale production function

The final good can be used for consumption, as well as for investment in physical
capital in each of the J intermediate good industries Xtj . We distinguish these intermediates by what we refer to as a sector and an industry. In particular, we assume
that there are S sectors in this economy, and that each sector contains Js industries,
where s = 1, ..., S. Each industry produces a single distinct good so that there are
J = ΣSs=1 Js goods being produced in this economy. Sectors diﬀer according to the
methods by which output is produced and factors are accumulated; within a sector,
the parameters governing production and accumulation of factors for each industry
are the same. We also assume that each industry within a sector has the same share
in production of the final good so that θj = θi for all i, j in sector s. Importantly,
each industry within a sector receives its own productivity shock and accumulates its
own stocks of human and physical capital. This is important below: because each
industry within a sector evolves separately, according to a process governed by the
9

same parameters, we will be able to characterize the invariant distribution of firm
sizes within each sector. In thinking about the data, we define our sectors to be
roughly comparable to the list of 3 digit NAICS classifications, while our industries
map into NAICS industries at a much finer level of disaggregation.
In each period, each member of the household is endowed with one unit of time
which the household can allocate to work in any one of the J industries, so that if we
denote by Ntj the amount of time worked in industry j, we have
J
X
j=1

Ntj ≤ Nt .

(3)

Households also rent out their stocks of each of the J industry-specific physical and
human capital stocks, which we denote by Ktj and Htj respectively. Physical capital
accumulates according to the log-linear form
λ

1−λj

Kt+1j = Ktjj Xtj

(4)

.

This log-linear form for physical capital accumulation has grown increasingly popular
as a device for modelling adjustment of physical capital while still admitting closed
form solutions. Here λj captures the importance of past physical capital stocks to
the amount of capital next period: if λj is one, capital does not evolve and is a fixed
factor; if λj is zero, physical capital depreciates fully each period.
Human capital is also assumed to accumulate according to a log-linear function
ω

1−ωj

Ht+1j = At+1j Htjj Itj

.

Here, At+1j is an industry specific shock that is assumed to be i.i.d. with compact
¤
£
support Aj , Aj and is designed to capture the random accumulation within an
industry, while Itj is an investment in human capital accumulation. These industry
specific productivity shocks are the only source of randomness in our model.
We assume that Itj is denominated in terms of the output of the industry itself,
in order to capture the idea that industry specific learning requires some industry
specific inputs, so that the resource constraint for output of industry j, Ytj , is
Qtj + Itj = Ytj .
10

In our framework there are no externalities: Human capital investments are paid by
households, and they rent the new human capital for use in production. In Section 3,
below, we also present an extension of the model which allows for learning-by-doing
externalities and show that it has similar properties. Moreover, with learning-bydoing externalities, households do not appropriate the rewards to industry-specific
learning, which is consistent with empirical evidence on industry specific human capital (for example, Kambourov and Manovskii 2002). The assumption that human
capital accumulation responds to industry-specific production levels is essential for
our results as it will serve as the primary source of industry specific mean reversion.
Finally, as noted above, we assume that the accumulation parameters are identical
across all industries within a sector; that is, ω j = ω i and λj = λi for all i, j in sector
s. The household begins with initial stocks of these specific factors denoted by K0j
and H0j .
2.2 Firms
Production within each industry takes place in production units that we call firms.
To begin, for simplicity, we abstract from firm specific heterogeneity and assume that
each firm in industry j at time t has access to the same production technology; we
relax this assumption in Section 3 below. To produce in a period, the firm must pay a
fixed cost Fj that period. Once the fixed cost has been paid, the firm hires industryj-specific physical capital ktj , in combination with an industry-j-specific labor input
that is, in turn, produced by combining raw labor ntj with industry-j-specific human
capital, htj , and produces according to
·
³ β 1−β ´1−αj ¸γ j
αj
ytj = ktj htjj ntj j
.
(5)
Here γ j < 1 captures the extent of decreasing returns to production which, in combination with the fixed cost, ensures that average costs are “U-shaped” and serves
to pin down the size of the firm. The parameter αj governs the share of physical
capital in value added, while β j captures the share of human capital in the labor
aggregate. Both production parameters and the process governing evolution of the
productivity shock are assumed to be common across all industries within a sector:
αj = αi , β j = β i and γ j = γ i for all i, j in sector s.
11

None of our results depend upon the denomination of the fixed cost, and so to
begin we assume that it is denominated in the units of the firms output. This has the
expositional advantage of pinning down the scale of production of the plant (measured
in terms of output), so that we can easily analyze the eﬀects of changes in factor prices
on the size of the firm (measured in terms of the number of employees); we return to
this assumption below.
2.3 Capital accumulation and labor allocation
To complete the characterization of the evolution of firm sizes in this economy,
all that is necessary is to characterize the evolution of productivity and factors in
equilibrium. If we allow for a non-integer number of firms, this economy satisfies
all of the assumptions of the welfare theorems. As we are primarily interested in
allocations, and not prices, we proceed by solving the Social Planning Problem for this

Inspection of this problem reveals that the choice of the number of firms is entirely
static: µtj only appears in the resource constraint for industry j at time t. This implies
that we can first solve for the optimal number of firms before solving for the dynamics
of the economy. The first order condition with respect to µtj is given by

If the stock of specific factors is high relative to the amount of labor employed in
the industry (which corresponds to the case of relatively cheap specific factor prices),
firms size measured in terms of the number of employees will be small. Similarly,
mean reversion in the stock of relative specific factor stocks will drive mean reversion
in firm sizes. Importantly, the qualitative nature of the relationship between factor
stocks and firm size can be reversed, without changing the result that mean reversion
in these stocks produces mean reversion in firms sizes. In the next section, we show
that the incentive to accumulate produces precisely the required mean reversion in
the general equilibrium of our model.
Substituting for the optimal number of firms into the resource constraint gives

This is our first main result: by varying the number of firms, each of which produces
at the bottom of its average cost curve, the industry behaves as though it has constant
returns to scale.
The result is an entirely standard log-linear multi-sector growth model with a new
constant returns to scale production function.4 As a result of the log-linear assumptions, we get the well-known result (see, for example, the appendix to Rossi-Hansberg
and Wright (2004a)) that income and substitution eﬀects oﬀset to ensure that a fixed
proportion of the labor supply is allocated to each industry, a fixed proportion of the
final good is consumed, while fixed proportions are invested in each industry, and a
fixed proportion of the output of each intermediate input is used for investment in
human capital specific to that industry.

2.4 Implications for Firm Growth, Exit, and the Firm Size Distribution
With these results in hand, we can now characterize the evolution of firm sizes in
the economy. Taking natural logarithms and diﬀerences of the expression for firm size
(12) we find that the growth rate of a firm in industry j is given by
ln nt+1j − ln ntj =

¡
¢
αj + β j (1 − αj ) gN − αj [ln Kt+1j − ln Ktj ]
−β j (1 − αj ) [ln Ht+1j − ln Htj ] ,

and substituting for the evolution of human capital we get
ln nt+1j − ln ntj =

¡
¢

−β j (1 − αj ) [ln At+1j + (ω j − 1) ln Htj + (1 − ω j ) Itj ] .

This equation reveals that the growth rate of a firm in industry j is driven by
three factors. The first is the deterministic growth in the aggregate labor supply
gN which, other things equal, encourages firms to expand in size over time. We will
often assume that either population growth is zero, or that firms growth rates are
being measured relative to trend, in order to abstract from this term. The second
factor is the growth in industry specific physical capital. However, as physical capital

Cobb-Douglas production function.

investment in each industry is a constant proportion of the aggregate production of
the final good, this is also determined by aggregate forces. Over time, if the number of
industries is large so that industry-specific randomness washes out in the aggregate,
the aggregate economy converges to a a steady state and this term will be a constant.
In what follows we assume this is the case in order to focus on industry specific
variation; in general, the results that follow can be thought of as being conditioned
upon the state of the aggregate economy. Finally, we have the contribution of industry
specific variability, which works through the shock to human capital accumulation,
and the level of industry output which aﬀects human capital accumulation through
Itj : if industry output is high, human capital accumulation proceeds, on average, at
a faster pace.
Before turning to a discussion of scale dependence in growth rates, it is useful to
begin by examining the conditions under which we get scale independent growth or,
in other words, the conditions under which we get Gibrat’s Law. First, suppose we
eliminate human capital as a factor of production by either reducing the importance
of labor as a whole (that is, reducing (1 − αj )) or reducing the importance of human
capital in producing labor services (that is, reducing β j ). In this case, the firm grows
at a deterministic rate that is independent of scale. This is due to the fact that the
only source of industry-specific randomness comes from shock to the accumulation
of human capital.5 Second, suppose that human capital is accumulated exogenously,
or that ωj = 1 : this ensures that output in an industry has no eﬀect on the pace of
its human capital accumulation.6 With the aggregate economy in steady state, the
growth rate of the firm becomes
¡
¢
ln nt+1j − ln ntj = αj + β j (1 − αj ) gN − β j (1 − αj ) ln At+1j ,

which is a constant plus an i.i.d. random variable: the growth rate of the firm is
5
One way to retain randomness in production while still eliminating human capital as a factor
is to scale up the shock to human capital by the inverse of the elasticity of human capital in
production β j (1 − αj ). In this case, the growth rate of the firm also satisfies Gibrat’s Law and
becomes ln nt+1j − ln ntj = αj gN − ln Ât+1j , where Ât+1j is the scaled shock process.
6
If ω j = 1, human capital in industry j, and consequently also output, is diﬀerence stationary. If
industry j is of positive measure, the aggregate physical capital stock will not in general converge
to a steady state under this assumption. As long as 1 − ω j is positive, no matter how small, the
existence of a steady state is preserved. When we refer to the case of ω j = 1 below, we shall think
of 1 − ω j arbitrarily small but positive.

15

independent of the size of the firm.
To see how firm growth rates depend upon firm size in general, assume as before
that population growth is zero and that the aggregate economy is in steady state
so that physical capital is constant in all industries. Then using equation (12) the
growth rate of the firm, after substituting for Itj , can be written as
¡
¢
ln nt+1j − ln ntj = nC − (1 − ω j ) 1 − β j + αj β j ln ntj − β j (1 − αj ) ln At+1j , (13)

where nC is a constant term that depends on the physical capital stock. We summarize
the results of this discussion in the following proposition in which we emphasize the
eﬀect of changes in physical capital intensity, an observable parameter which we focus
upon in our empirical analysis.
Proposition 1 Firm growth rates are weakly decreasing in size. The higher is the
physical capital share, the faster growth rates decline with size. The growth rate of
firms is independent of its size only if either human capital is not a factor of production
(in the limit as β j or (1 − αj ) are equal to 0), or human capital evolves exogenously
(in the limit as ωj approaches one).
The log-linearity of the model was shown above to imply that the employment
allocation across industries was constant over time. Combined with the result of the
above proposition, this has strong implications on exit rates: there is exit whenever
firm sizes grow on average. In a more general model in which the labor allocation
varies in equilibrium this result continues to hold as long as the elasticity of substitution in consumption of each good is not too large. This is suﬃcient to guarantee
that the labor allocation to the industry does not change by as much as firm sizes.
Moreover, the above proposition implies that the higher the physical capital share,
the faster the exit rate decreases with firm size.
Corollary 2 Firm exit rates are weakly decreasing in size. The higher is the physical
capital share, the faster exit rates decline with size. The exit rate of firms is independent of size only if either human capital is not a factor of production (in the limit as
β j or (1 − αj ) are equal to 0), or human capital evolves exogenously (in the limit as
ω j approaches one).
16

These implications for the relationship between physical capital shares, firm growth
rates and exit can be tested directly using longitudinal data. In combination with
the assumption that the distribution of firm sizes has converged to its long-run distribution, we can also test this implication with data on the size distribution of firms.
Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2004) showed that the combination of scale independent
growth for a finite number of industries, combined with this form of entry and exit,
is suﬃcient to generate an invariant distribution that satisfied Zipf’s law: the size
distribution is Pareto with coeﬃcient one. Away from these limits, when there is
mean reversion in firm growth rates, it can be established that there exists a unique
invariant distribution that has thinner tails than implied by Zipf’s Law: there is a
relative absence of very small, and very large, firms. We can also establish that the
tails of the size distribution become thinner as physical capital shares increase. These
claims are proven in the following three propositions.
Proposition 3 (Zipf’s Law) If either human capital is not a factor of production (in
the limit as β j or (1 − αj ) are equal to 0), or human capital evolves exogenously (in
the limit as ω j approaches one), the size distribution of firms converges to a Pareto
distribution with shape coeﬃcient one.
Proof. See Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2004) Proposition 4.
Outside of these special cases, we can also characterize the invariant distribution of
firm sizes. We begin by establishing the existence of a unique invariant distribution.
The proof of the following proposition requires compactness of the space of firm sizes
which follows directly from our assumption that log productivity levels lie in the
¤
£
compact set ln A, ln A for some A suitably small and A suitably large, and that
firm sizes are measured relative to trend (or equivalently that population growth is
zero). These assumptions imply that
ln ntj ∈ LN ≡

Proposition 4 For any αj , β j , ω j ∈ (0, 1), there exists a unique invariant distribution over firm sizes in sector j.
17

Proof. The proof is independent for each sector so we drop j from the notation. The
size of a firm at time t + 1 is given by
¡
¡
¢¢
ln nt+1 = g (nt , At+1 ) ≡ − ln At+1 + 1 − (1 − ω j ) 1 − β j (1 − αj ) ln nt ,

where we have assumes that the population size is fixed (alternatively, we could work
with variations from trend). This lies in the compact set LN defined above. Let µ
be the probability measure over A. Then, the probability of a transition from a point
n to a set S is given by
Q (n, S) = µ (A : g (n, A) ∈ S) .
For any function f : LN → R define the operator T by

Since the set LN is compact, we are able to use Theorem 12.12 in Stokey, Lucas
and Prescott (1989) to prove that there exists a unique invariant distribution, if we
can show that the transition probability function Q satisfies the Feller property, is
monotone, and satisfies the mixing condition.
To see that it satisfies the Feller Property, note that the function g is continuous
in ln n, and ln A. Since g is continuous and bounded, if f is continuous and bounded,
f (g(·)) will be continuous and bounded and therefore so is T f . Hence T maps the
space of bounded continuous functions into itself, T : C(S̄) → C(S̄). To see that
it is monotone, we need to prove that if f : LN → R is a non-decreasing function,
then so is T f. But this follows from the fact that the g is non-decreasing in n. Hence
f (g(n, A)) is non-decreasing in n and therefore so is T f.
Finally, to show that it satisfies the mixing condition, we need to show that there
exists c ∈ LN and η > 0 such that

Let c = 0. As g is continuous and decreasing in A, there exists an A0 such that for
all A ≤ A0 , g (n, A) > 0. Let η 0 = 1 − µ(A0 ). Similarly there exists an A00 such
that for all ε ≤ A00 , g (n, A) < 0. Let η 00 = 1 − µ(A00 ). Call the minimum of these
probabilities η. Then c = 0 and η guarantee that the mixing condition holds. Theorem
12.12 in Stokey, Lucas and Prescott (1989) then guarantees that there exists a unique
invariant distribution, and that the iterates of T ∗ converge weakly to that invariant
distribution.
For any αj , β j , ωj ∈ (0, 1) , we have established that the invariant distribution of
firms sizes has thinner tails than the Pareto distribution with coeﬃcient one. Moreover, we can order distributions in terms of the thinness of their tails, and can show
that industries with higher physical capital shares have thinner tails. This will be
useful below when we contrast the size distributions of firms in industries with diﬀerent physical capital shares. We make these notions precise in the following definition
and proposition.
£ ¤
Definition 5 Let λ and ψ be probability measures on b, b . The probability measure
£ ¤
λ has thinner tails than ψ if there exists x and x ∈ b, b such that for all b ≤ x ≤ x,
λ ([b, x]) ≤ ψ ([b, x]) , for all x ≤ x ≤ x, λ ([x, x]) ≥ ψ ([x, x]), and for all x ≤ x ≤ b,
λ ([x, x]) ≤ ψ ([x, x]) .
In order to apply this definition, we need to standardize the support of the size distributions produced by our model. This is also necessary to contrast the implications
of our model with the data where the size categories are the same for all industries.
If we scale the productivity process Atj by
¢
¡
1 − ω j 1 − β j (1 − αj )
β j (1 − αj )
the support of the firm size distribution is unchanged across industries and is equal
¤
£
to − ln A, − ln A . Under this scaling, we prove the following proposition.
19

Proposition 6 For any αj , β j , ω j ∈ (0, 1) , the invariant distribution of firm sizes
has thinner tails than the Pareto distribution with coeﬃcient one. Other things equal,
if αj > αk , the invariant distribution of firms in sector j has thinner tails than the
invariant distribution of firms in sector k.
Proof. The first claim is immediate form the discussion above. To see the second, for
each α denote the unique invariant probability measure of firm sizes (see Proposition
4) by λα : LN → [0, 1] , where LN denotes the Borel σ−algebra associated with
LN, with associated transition function Qα and operator Tα∗ . Since λα is an invariant

and hence λαk is not the invariant distribution αk , and the operator Tα∗j maps the λαk
into distributions with thinner left tails. The case for intermediate and high ln n are
analogous.
In this section, we established that the process of accumulating industry specific
human capital alone is suﬃcient to generate many observed properties of firm size
dynamics and firm size distributions. In particular, mean reversion in the stock of
industry specific human capital will cause small firms to grow faster than large firms
and exit rates of firms to decline with size. Moreover we were also able to establish
that the invariant distribution of firm sizes would have thinner tails than the Pareto
distribution with coeﬃcient one.
20

As a consequence of using the accumulation of industry specific human capital to
explain scale dependence, our theory also predicts that the degree of scale dependence
varies with the physical capital intensity of the industry. In Section 4 below we
examine this implication in US data. Before turning to the data, the next section
establishes that these implications are robust to a number of diﬀerent modelling
assumptions that were adopted above either for simplicity or expositional reasons.
3. ROBUSTNESS OF THE MECHANISM
In the introduction we argued that it is essential that any proposed explanation for
the documented patterns in firm dynamics and size distribution be robust to the wide
variety of diﬀerences in institutions and market structures for which these patterns
have been observed. In this section, we establish that the mechanism described above
in a particular setup survives generalization to environments in which the specification
of firm costs are diﬀerent, to the introduction of firm level heterogeneity, to alternative
mechanisms for the accumulation of human capital such as learning by doing, and to
an environment in which competition amongst firms is monopolistic. In each case, we
show how the general pattern of mean reversion in industry specific human capital
stocks leads to mean reversion in firms sizes.
3.1 Firm Costs
The basic mechanism of our paper relies on mean reversion in the stock of industry
specific human capital of production. Mean reversion in turn leads to the mean
reverting characteristics that we emphasized for firm dynamics and size distributions.
Nothing about this argument depends upon the qualitative relationship between the
relative stock of factors, and the relative size of the firm. In the model presented
above, we assumed for simplicity that the firms cost structure combined decreasing
returns to scale with a fixed cost denominated in terms of the firm’s output. This
combination implied that the output of the firm was constant, so that firms reduced
employment (and hence size in terms of employment) when the stock of specific human
capital grew. In other words, reversion to the mean in the stock of specific factors
from above, produces reversion to the mean in firm sizes from below.

21

Changes in the specification of the cost structure have the potential to reverse the
qualitative relationship between factor supplies and firm size. To see this, assume as
before that each firm in industry j at time t produces output according to equation
(5). Now, however, assume that fixed costs depend on the average number of workers
hired in industry j at time t, n̄tj . In particular, assume that fixed costs are given
ξ
by Fj n̄tjj . We have in mind institutional or organizational costs (for example dealing
with unions or other industry organizations) that depend on the average size of firms
in the industry. Individual firms do not take into account the eﬀect of their hiring
decisions on the fixed costs, so the problem of the firm is identical to the one presented
above. The problem of the firm is to maximize profits
ξ

max Π ≡ max ytj − rtj ktj − stj htj − wtj ntj − Fj n̄tjj ,

ktj ,htj ,ntj

ktj ,htj ,ntj

where rtj , stj , wtj denote the corresponding factor prices. We assume that 0 ≤ ξ j < 1
and so if ξ j = 0 we have the same case studied above. Taking first order conditions
and allowing for free entry and exit so that profits are zero implies
¢
¡
ξ
1 − γ j ytj = Fj n̄tjj .

Now output changes with the average level of employment in the industry and, since
in equilibrium all firms are identical, also with the employment level of the firm. Given
this symmetry, equilibrium in factor markets implies that the size of the typical firm
in the industry is given by

This equation is analogous to the case considered above with a pure fixed cost.
The main diﬀerences are that now both employment and output respond to changes
in factor supplies.7 Moreover, the direction of the change can diﬀer: for ξ j < γ j ,
the behavior of employment is as before, declining with the industry physical and
human capital stocks; for ξ j > γ j this pattern is reversed and the size of firms
7
Notice that because the fixed costs entail an external cost, the equilibrium will not be Pareto
optimal. However, one can set up a pseudo-social planner problem that yields the same aggregate
implications than the problem discussed in the Section 2 (see also Section 3.4).

22

depends positively on the stock of both types of capital but negatively with industry
employment. In either case, the main properties for firm growth and exit rates, and
the size distribution, are preserved: regardless of whether firms in industries with
large human capital stocks are large or small they revert to the mean. The example
illustrates that the necessary property of firm sizes is that they respond monotonically
to the stock of human capital in the industry. The direction of this response is not
important: in the case where ξ j > γ j , reversion to the mean in the stock of specific
factors from above, produces reversion to the mean in firm sizes from above. Mean
reversion in the stock of human capital then leads to the same arguments and results
we presented above.
3.2 Within Industry Firm Heterogeneity
In the theory presented above, we abstracted from heterogeneity amongst firms
within an industry in order to focus our attention on heterogeneity across industries.
This allowed us to emphasize the contribution of the accumulation of industry specific
human capital to the evolution of firm sizes. Clearly, there exist diﬀerences in firm
sizes even within narrowly defined industries. While this may be caused by aggregation (data is rarely available beyond the three or four digit SIC levels), it is probable
that some firm specific heterogeneity remains. In this section we demonstrate how
firm specific heterogeneity can be added to our framework, and show that it does
not change the key empirical implications of our theory for the diﬀerences in firm
dynamics and size distributions across industries.
Consider the model of Section 2, where we suppress time and industry subscripts.
Suppose that after having decided to produce in a period (that is, after paying the
fixed cost F ) each firm i ∈ [0, µ] observes a firm specific productivity shock zi . This
shock is assumed to be i.i.d. over time, firms and industries within a sector. After
observing this shock, the firm i can then hire labor ni and industry-j-specific physical,
ki , and human capital, hi , to produce output according to
µ h
i1−α ¶γ

yi = zi ki hi ni
.
To see how this aﬀects the results, we consider once again the social planners
problem. To begin, suppose that the planner has decided that there are µ firms in
23

the industry employing N workers. The amounts of industry specific physical and
human capital are fixed at K and H. The planner then observes the identities of the
firms that receive each productivity shock. The problem of the planner is then to
allocate factors across firms in the industry to maximize industry output

From this equation, it is easy to see that the form of the industry production function
is exactly the same as for the original problem, and consequently that the choices of
N and µ, as well as investment in both types of capital, are analogously determined.
Clearly, the addition of an i.i.d. productivity shock has no eﬀect on the mean
growth and exit rates of firms in that industry. Consequently, the model has the
same implications for growth and exit at the sector level. Further, the distribution
of average firm sizes is unchanged, and so the relationship between factor intensities
and the shapes of the firm size distribution is unchanged. One implication that can
be aﬀected is the range of cases under which Zipf’s Law exactly holds: when the
conditions of Proposition 3 hold, we observe Zipf’s Law for average firm sizes, but
only for actual firm sizes if either all firms are identical within an industry, or if the
distribution within an industry is also Pareto with coeﬃcient one. We might think
of the latter as being produced by a similar mechanism as the one laid out in this
paper, working through firm specific human capital.
3.3 Learning-by-Doing Externalities
In the model of Section 2, we assumed that human capital accumulation required
some industry specific inputs. The dependence on industry-specific inputs was important for our model, as it allows human capital accumulation to vary with output
in the industry, and is the primary source of mean reversion at the industry level.
In that model, the inputs to learning were purchased by consumers, and the resulting level of human capital was rented out by consumers, so that there was no
externality. An alternative assumption that has similar eﬀects is the assumption that
human capital is accumulated from learning-by-doing externalities of the form
ω

1−ω j

Ht+1j = At+1j Htjj Ytj

,

which states that the higher is output in the industry, the higher is accumulation of
human capital. Importantly, this involves no resource cost to the economy. Suppose
also that production occurs according to
25

¤γ 1−γ
£ α
Ytj + Fj µtj = Ktjj (Htj Ntj )1−αj j µtj j ,

so human capital operates exactly like labor augmenting technological progress.
Although we can no longer use the social planners problem to solve for equilibrium
allocations in this model, but we can use a pseudo-planner problem to solve it as we do
in Subsection 3.4. Similar reasoning then produces an expression for the normalized
rate of the growth of the firm of
ln nt+1 − ln nt = nC − αj (1 − ω j ) ln nt − (1 − αj ) ln At+1 ,
where nC again denotes a constant specific to this formulation. If there is no learning
by doing, or ωj = 1, there is no mean reversion in human capital stocks, and firm
growth rates satisfy Gibrat’s Law. As before, increases in the capital intensity of an
industry increase the rate of mean reversion in firm sizes.
This extension emphasizes that it is not industry specific human capital per se, but
rather the sensitivity of current production decisions to past output in the industry,
that is important for our results on mean reversion. This is important in the light
of recent research by Kambourov and Manovskii (2002) who argue that there is little
evidence for industry-specific human capital in individual earnings data8 . However,
this evidence is consistent with industry-specific learning-by-doing externalities where
individual workers do not appropriate the returns to industry-specific human capital.
3.4 Monopolistic competition
The previous model uses an extremely simple theory of the firm to derive conclusions on the size distribution of firms. In this section we use a diﬀerent theory of the
firm to show that the conclusions derived above are not specific to that particular
theory of the organization of production in firms. For this we use the Dixit-Stiglitz
monopolistic competition model with taste for variety. In this model substitution for
varieties in the same industry limits demand for a particular variety in an industry
8

Our model makes no distinction between workers within an industry, and so cannot distinguish

between industry-specific human capital and the occupation-specific human capital emphasized by
Kambourov and Manovskii (2002).

26

and therefore determines the size of the firm. The model includes naturally the two
margins we have emphasized so far, the number of firms in an industry and the size of
these firms. We need a version of this theory where both margins react to factor accumulation. In particular, a theory that includes the three factors that we introduced
in the model above. Now, physical and human capital are specific to an industry but
mobile across varieties within that industry.
3.4.1 Households.–
As above, we assume that there are J industries divided into sectors with similar
technologies. Now, however, we assume that each industry consists of a continuum
of potential varieties which we index by . Households provide labor and industryspecific (but not variety-specific) physical and human capital to each variety within an
industry. Output of each variety Dtj is combined by the household using a constant
elasticity of substitution production function with parameter σ j > 1 to produce a
composite industry good that is used for investment in human capital and as an
input to production of a final good (in combination with the composite goods of
other industries) that is consumed and invested in physical capital.
That is, the problem of a consumer is to purchase goods and accumulate industry
specific capitals to maximize lifetime utility, or

3.4.3 Capital accumulation, labor allocation and firm sizes.–
All that remains is to calculate the accumulation decisions of agents. Although this
can be done directly from the agents decision problem, it is instructive to compute
them in an analogous way to the allocations for the perfectly competitive economy
discussed above. Although the welfare theorems do not hold for this economy, the
fact that the markup of these monopolistic firms is constant combined with the loglinearity of the model means that the equilibrium allocations can be obtained as the
solution of an equivalent optimum problem that is identical to the social planners
problem used above, except that the resource constraint is now

for all t and j (see Chapter 18 of Stokey, Lucas and Prescott (1989) for another
example of this pseudo-economy approach). As before, the solution of this model
has the household accumulating a fixed proportion of the output of each industry
to produce investment in physical and human capital. The allocation of labor to
work in each industry is fixed at the same levels as before. From these results it is
straightforward to show that the evolution of firm sizes in the model with monopolistic
competition is identical (with γ = 1) to the evolution of firm sizes in the model with
perfect competition. In particular, analogues of Propositions 1, 3, 4, and 6 and of
Corollary 2 continue to hold.
4. EVIDENCE ON SCALE DEPENDENCE BY SECTOR
The model above has several empirical implications that are consistent with findings
in the empirical literature. Firm growth and exit rates decline with size, and the size
distribution has thinner tails than the Pareto with shape coeﬃcient one. On top of
this, in our theory the degree of reversion to the mean in human capital stocks, and
therefore in firms sizes, increases with the degree of diminishing returns in human
capital, or equivalently decreases with the degree of diminishing returns in physical
capital. A very low physical capital share implies a high human capital share, hence
a low degree of diminishing returns in human capital and, therefore, a low degree of
reversion to the mean in firm sizes. As the physical capital share increases from zero
30

the degree of diminishing returns in human capital increases as does the reversion
to the mean in firm sizes. This implication of the model implies that the degree of
mean reversion in growth rates, the degree of scale dependence in exit rates, and
the thinness of the tails of the size distribution, are intrinsically determined by the
importance of industry specific physical capital in technology. In this section we
contrast this implication with the data.
4.1 Data
We have investigated the variation in scale dependence across sectors using data
on growth rates and the distribution of firm sizes. We use two data-sets constructed
especially for us by the US Census Bureau. The first is a data-set from the Statistics
of US Businesses (SUSB) program on establishment size distributions by sector at
the two digit SIC level for 1990 and three digit NAICS level for 2000. These data are
constructed from a number of sources including the annual County Business Profile
(CBP) data files. The second data-set, from the Business Information Tracking System (BITS), contains data on growth rates of establishments between 1990 and 2000,
and deaths of establishments by size category for 1995-1996. These new data sets
have several advantages for our purposes in comparison with the publicly available
data sources. First, they provide the number of firms per size category for the finest
size categories that the US Census will release given the confidentiality restrictions.
Because of our emphasis on the shape of the size distribution, this level of detail is
crucial. Previous analysis of the size distribution of firms have, to our knowledge,
used data for much larger size bins or only for a couple of sectors. Second, it includes
all sectors in the private non-farm US economy, including both manufacturing and
services. This is important for our study given that we want to understand the effect of sectoral diﬀerences in physical capital shares on the size distribution of firms.
Variations in physical capital shares are much larger across service and manufacturing sectors than within them. Third, the data refers to establishment sizes, and not
enterprise sizes, which as we argued before is a better fit for our theory. The unique
aspect of the longitudinal data-set is that it tracks the size of firms for several years,
and, for exiting firms, for three years before they exit.
We also need to calculate physical capital shares. We do this using the Bureau of
31

Economic Analysis (BEA) Industry Accounts. We use data on labor costs and value
added at basic prices to construct labor shares which include human capital. We then
construct physical capital shares as one minus the labor share. This implies that the
physical capital shares we use include everything that is not classified as labor. There
are two potential problems with the physical capital shares we compute. First, the
physical capital shares include land shares. Land is not an industry specific factor,
but as its share is usually small, this should have a negligible eﬀect on the physical
capital shares we use. Second, we are using the physical capital share in value added,
but our theory is abstracting from the use of intermediate inputs. To address the
former, we only consider industries with physical capital shares smaller than one half,
although the result are similar if we consider all sectors. To address the latter, we
also present results with physical capital shares adjusted for the share of value added
and the share of materials purchased from the same industry.
4.2 Growth Rates
We begin by examining the growth rates of surviving firms. As a first step, consider
an example with two sectors. Educational services is a very labor and human capital
intensive sector with a physical capital share of 0.054, while manufacturing is much
more physical capital intensive with a physical capital share of 0.397. If the theory is
consistent with the data, given that manufacturing is more physical capital intensive,
we should see growth rates of manufacturing firms decline faster with size than growth
rates of firms in the educational sector (Proposition 1).
Figure 5 illustrates that this is the case, and shows that the diﬀerences are very
large over a period of ten years. Not only do small firms grow faster than large firms
in both sectors, but the scale dependence is significant for the entire range of firm
sizes. The diﬀerence between the growth rates in these two sectors increases with
firm size and is, for the largest firms, more than 40 per-cent.
This evidence is not particular to the pair of sectors in the example. We examine
next the implication of our theory that scale dependence in growth rates increases with
physical capital shares (denoted by αj ) for all industries. We use data on the growth
of firms, gj , in a particular size category, xj , and estimate the following regression:
ln (1 + gj ) = ãj + b̃ ln xj + ẽαj ln xj + ε̃tj .

This amounts to fitting an exponential trend where the parameter varies linearly
with physical capital shares by sector. We estimate this relationship using weighted
least squares to take into account the fact that there are many more firms in the
smaller size categories. We calculate the weights using data on the number of firms
in each size category. The theory predicts that the estimate of ẽ should be negative
and significant.

The estimate of ẽ is presented in the first column of Table 1. The third column of
Table 1 presents the result of a similar exercise fitting a power function instead of an
exponential. Given the largest firm size in our sample, a larger (in absolute value)
coeﬃcient implies more scale dependence for all firm sizes. The results in Table 1 show
33

that scale dependence increases significantly with sectoral physical capital shares: A
doubling in the size of firms in manufacturing (αj ≈ 1/3) decreases average growth
by about 4% while in educational services (αj ≈ 0) the growth rate is roughly the
same.
As mentioned before, the physical capital shares have been calculated as 1 minus the
share of labor compensation in value added. Given that materials are an important
fraction of gross output in an industry, this may result in physical capital shares that
are too large relative to the ones in gross output. Since our theory does not include
materials, it is not designed to address this distinction. To address these concerns
we calculated the share of value added plus the share of inputs originating from the
same sector using the input-output data provided by the BEA. We then multiply
this share by the physical capital share to obtain an adjusted physical capital share.
If all intermediate inputs originated in the same sector, the original physical capital
shares would equal the adjusted physical capital shares. If the rest of the materials
used in production are homogeneous, the adjusted physical capital shares would diﬀer
from the original shares, and the adjustment is theoretically exact. In general, even
with this adjustment, we are abstracting from the eﬀects of mean reversion in human
capital stocks in other industries. However, one would expect the omission of these
eﬀects to bias our coeﬃcients toward zero. Given the statistical significance of our
results presented in columns two and four of Table 1, we believe that this does not
undermine our empirical strategy.9 The omission of intermediate inputs from other
sectors may account for some of the unexplained variation in growth rates. Variation
across sectors in other parameters of the model, such as the share of raw labor, the
variance of productivity shocks, or the depreciation parameters, may account for some
of the unexplained variation too.
The last ten years have witnessed a substantial decline in employment among
large manufacturing establishments. A potential concern is that this may be driving
the larger scale dependence observed in these sectors. To address this concern,
we replicate the previous exercise for manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors separately. The results presented in Table 2 show that this phenomenon is
9

Adjusting the physical capital shares increases the number of sectors in our sample with physical
capital shares below one-half from 44 to 52.

34

not driving the results in Table 1. The point estimates for both manufacturing and
non-manufacturing are close to the ones for the whole economy. The estimates for
non-manufacturing are highly significant as before. For manufacturing the estimates
are less precise reflecting the smaller variation in physical capital shares among these
sectors. This was precisely our original justification for using all sectors in the economy. Table 2 presents results only for exponential trends, the result for power trends
are similar.

Our estimation of b̃ and ẽ assumes that both β j and ωj are constant across industries
(call these values β and ω respectively). We can then use the estimates presented in
Table 1 and 2, together with the estimates of b̃ and Equation (13) to infer values for
β and ω. The estimates of b̃ for the exercises in the first two columns of Table 1 are:
−.23 (s.e. .01), −.24 (s.e. .01). This values imply a share of specific human capital
in labor services given by β = .29 and .35, and a share of investments in human
capital production given by 1 − ω = .33 and .35, respectively. That is, the model,
and the estimation above, imply that the share of labor services related to specific
human capital is around one third. Thus, as we have argued in this paper, the share
of specific human capital consistent with the scale dependence in firm dynamics is
very significant. Other forms of human capital that are not industry specific, and
therefore are associated with individuals and not with an industry are, of course, not
included in this share. If some of the industry specific human capital is accumulated
through learning by doing, and therefore not appropriated by individuals as in Section
35

3.3., these numbers will be biased down. The inferred share of investments in human
capital production (1 − ω) is certainly reasonable given that we are using 10 year
growth rates. We replicated the same exercise for the manufacturing and service
sectors. The estimates of b̃ for the exercises in the first and third column of Table
2 are: −.20 (s.e. .15) and −.23 (s.e. .01). This yields β = .35 and 1 − ω = .31 for
manufacturing, as well as β = .29 and 1−ω = .33 for services. Industry specific human
capital is, therefore, more important in the service sector than in manufacturing and
it depreciates more slowly, although the diﬀerences are small and insignificant in light
of the imprecision of our estimates for the manufacturing sector. This is reassuring
given our assumption that both β and ω do not vary significantly across industries.
4.3 Size Distribution of Firms
We next turn to the implication of our theory for the size distribution of firms. From
the available data we can calculate the share of firms in sector j with employment
larger than xj , which we denote by Pj . If the distribution of firm sizes is Pareto with
coeﬃcient one, or growth rates are scale independent, the relationship between ln Pj
and ln xj should be linear with slope minus one. If growth rates depend negatively
on scale, the tails of the distribution are thinner than the tails of a Pareto with
coeﬃcient one, and the relationship is concave. Our theory states that the degree
of concavity should be positively related with physical capital shares (Proposition
6). A first look at the data is presented in Figures 6 where we plot ln Pj and xj for
educational services and manufacturing.
This representation of the size distribution emphasizes the degree of concavity and
makes diﬀerences between two distributions particularly clear for large firm sizes. The
diﬀerences between the distribution are also clear if we look at the density functions.
The density of firm sizes in these two sectors (with normalized means) is presented
in Figure 7. It is clear how the distribution of firm sizes in the educational sector
has more mass for very small and large firms, and less mass for intermediate firms
than in the manufacturing sector. This is particularly clear for small firms in the
graph. The figure also compares these distributions with the Pareto distribution with
coeﬃcient one (that corresponds to a straight line with slope -1 in Figure 6). The
Pareto distribution with coeﬃcient one has even more mass at the tails and less at the
36

center, consistent with Proposition 6 as long as β j , ω j , (1 − αj ) > 0. Both industries
have thinner tails than the benchmark, but as the theory predicts, the diﬀerence is
larger for the manufacturing sector. As emphasized in the introduction, the diﬀerences
between these distributions are economically large. If the manufacturing sector had
the same distribution as the educational sector, around 20% of the labor force in the
sector that currently works in medium size firms would need to be reallocated to firms
with less than 50 or more than 1000 employees.

In order to test the relationship between physical capital shares and the size distribution of firms for all sectors, we use our new data set on the size distributions
of establishments for 1990 and 2000. To examine this, we estimate the following
regression
ln Pj = âj + b̂j ln xj + dˆ(ln xj )2 + êαj (ln xj )2 + ε̂j ,
where âj and b̂j are industry specific coeﬃcients. This amounts to constraining the
quadratic term to vary linearly with the physical capital share. The model now
predicts that ê should be negative and significant. The results are presented in Table
3.

37

The estimate of ê for 1990, in the first column of Table 3, is negative and strongly
significant. We also estimated the same regression using NAICS three digit sectors in
2000. The physical capital shares used in this regression are not as trustworthy as the
ones in 1990 given that we had to convert the data available for 2000 from the BEA
to this industry classification system. Even with this problem, the results presented
in the second column of Table 3 show that the estimate of ê is smaller in absolute
value but still negative and strongly significant. The results with adjusted physical
capital shares are presented in the third column of Table 3, which further confirms the
empirical significance of the mechanism in our theory. As for growth rates the results
are similar when we use the sub-samples of manufacturing and non-manufacturing
sectors.

4.4 Exit Rates
Our mechanism, which emphasizes mean reversion in stocks of specific factors,
when combined with particular assumptions on preferences, also implies that exit
rates should decline with firm size. Furthermore, the rate of decline should vary with
physical capital shares. Figure 8 illustrates this using BITS data for US manufacturing
and educational services in 1995-1996. The dashed lines represent exit rates in 19951996 by establishment size category. The thin solid lines represent the exit rates in
1995 by 1994 size category, and the dark line by 1992 size class. The number of firm
deaths is divided by the number of surviving firms to compute exit rates.
For firms with more than 50 employees the theory does well. Exit rates decline
clearly faster with size for manufacturing than for educational services. Overall, the
exponential trend in manufacturing is steeper than in educational services, although
the diﬀerence is small given the large variance (a rate of decline of −0.0379 for man38

ufacturing and −0.0364 for educational services).10 The results hold more strongly
across all sectors in the economy, especially if we focus on the size distribution of exiting firms three years before they exit. The reason we believe this is the best test for
our theory is that it reduces exit produced purely by selection. We run the following
regression
ln (1 + ERj ) = ǎj + b̌ ln xj + ěαj ln xj + ε̌tj ,
which amounts to estimating an exponential relationship between exit rates and sizes
three years before exit.

The results are presented in Table 4. The first two columns present the weighted
least squares results with weights given by the total number of firms in the representative size category, for both unadjusted and adjusted physical capital shares. The last
two columns present results from the same exercise using a power function instead of
an exponential. The results are consistent with our theory: All of the estimates are
negative and significant. The results are also economically significant: A doubling of
10

Orr (1974), Gorecki (1976), Hause and Du Rietz (1984) and MacDonald (1986) found that firm
exit rates were negatively related to measures of physical capital intensity by industry. Given that
these studies do not distinguish among firms with diﬀerent sizes, the negative relationship may be
the result of the dependence predicted by our theory. This would be the case if firms in physical
capital intensive sectors are larger on average.

not decline with size in educational services.

5. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have constructed a theory that is consistent with some well known
facts on scale dependence in firm dynamics and firm size distributions. The mechanism emphasizes the role of the accumulation of industry specific human capital. We
have shown that this mechanism is robust to institutional and economic diﬀerences
across sectors and countries. We claim that the ubiquitous presence of these facts has
to be the result of a mechanism that is present in a variety of circumstances. The
central role of accumulation of industry specific human capital in the theory led us to
focus on cross sectoral diﬀerences in the importance of human, and therefore physical,
capital in production, and in particular physical capital intensity. Increases in the
importance of industry specific physical capital lead to an increase in the degree of
diminishing returns in human capital, and hence more scale dependence in growth,
exit rates, and firm size distributions. Since it was the theory that guided our focus
on this particular dimension of the data, the available evidence in the empirical literature is only indirect. Consequently, we take this prediction to the data and show
that it is a surprisingly good description for the cross-section of US sectors.
Our theory implies that exit rates should decline with size. Conversely, it implies
that entry rates should increase with size. The model’s implications on exit rates are
consistent with the empirical evidence. However, entry rates do not seem to increase
40

with size; new entrants start their businesses at a small scale. On the one hand, it is
puzzling that a theory that does a good job in explaining many related phenomena
is not successful in this particular dimension. On the other, we built a theory under
the strong assumption that entry is frictionless: a strong assumption especially if we
look at firm sizes in their first year of existence. Detailed longitudinal data on entry
and exit may shed light on whether looking at size several years after entry eliminates
this mismatch.
In the introduction we commented on diﬀerent studies that have emphasized financial as well as other types of frictions. What we show in this paper is that even though
these frictions may be important for entry, they are not needed to generate any of the
other empirical observations. This points to frictions in entry that might be alleviated
with particular policies. It is important, however, that these policies do not interfere with the growth and exit of existing firms; processes that are well described by
our eﬃcient economy. Our results are, in general, not sensitive to government policies
that aﬀect firms independently of their size. Scale dependent policies may aﬀect some
of our implications and Restuccia and Rogerson (2004) argue that scale dependent
policies may have large eﬀects on eﬃciency. International evidence on firms dynamics
and the size distribution of firms, when combined with our benchmark, could shed
some light on the empirical significance of scale dependent policies.
By emphasizing the accumulation of specific human capital, our theory also makes
predictions for the future evolution of the firm size distribution. The ongoing specialization of developed economies in services will have important consequences on
firm sizes and firm dynamics. Our theory predicts that this will lead to a more dispersed distribution of firm sizes, where we will see more small and more very large
firms. These arguments suggest that we are moving towards an economy in which
the dominance of large firms in some industries, like Walmart, will coexist increasingly with large numbers of small firms in diﬀerent industries within the same sector,
like bakeries or tailors. This trend is the natural result of the eﬃcient division of an
industry’s production among firms.
