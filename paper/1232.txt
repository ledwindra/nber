The Theory of Optimum Deficits and Debt
ABSTRACT

The paper surveys a number of neo—classical and neo—Keynesian approcaches to

government financial policy. After reviewing the very restrictive conditions under
which financial policy is just a veil without real consequences, non—neutral financial

in neo—classical models is analyzed. At full employment, the substitution of
borrowing for lump sum taxes crowds out private capital formation in a closed economy.
policy

Government financial policy can be used to implement optimal intertemporal risk
distribution schemes. In the presence of distortionary taxes, the smoothing of

may be optimal even where this involves systematic and predictable
departures from continuous budget balance.
tax rates over time

The case for deficit finance and the operation of the automatic fiscal stabilizers
in a Keynesian world with disequilibrium in labour and output markets is restated.

The case for any kind of active financial policy rests on the presence of
capital market imperfections (including incomplete contingent forward markets
such as insurance markets), on the longevity of the institution of government and
on the government's unique ability to tax.

Finally, certain long—run aspects of the fiscal and monetary stance are

analyzed. This includes their sustainability, i.e. the consistency of long—
term spending and taxation plans with the monetary objectives and the crowding out

targets. The concepts of the comprehensive net worth of the public sector and its
permanent income are central to this analysis. The current U.K. position appears to
be one of an unsustainable, "permanent surplus."

1. Introduction
This paper deals with some of the issues that arise in connection with
the optimal financing of a given progrannne of "exhaustive" public

spending on goods and services. The determination of the size and
composition of this real spending programme is not considered. A more
general

view would encompass the optimal joint determination of the

public sector 's consumption and investment programme

financing,

and its method of

but even the less ambitious approach adopted here raises a

very wide range of issues and considerations.

Government financial policy is about the management of the public sector

balance sheet, broadly defined. It includes the choice of taxation
versus borrowing. It also concerns the composition or structure of
taxes (lump-sum, direct, indirect, degree of progression, etc.) and
the characteristics of the debt instruments issued by the government
(interest-bearing or non-interest bearing, legal tender, maturity, degree

of indexing, etc.). Monetary policy, exchange rate management and foreign
exchange market intervention therefore belong to financial policy as
much as open market operations or bond issues "to finance the deficit".
It should be obvious that questions concerning the distribution of income
(intra—generational as well as intergenerational) are inextricably
intertwined

spending

with questions relating to the financing of a given real

programme. Stiglitz (l983a,b) has emphasised the inevitable

intertemporal and intergenerational risk-sharing attributes of financial
policy, something I shall return to in Section II.

Like any other kind of government intervention in the economy,
government financial policy can be rationalised in one of two ways.

first is intervention for purely distributional reasons. While

The

they are of major importance, I shall not pay much attention in what

follows to the distributional objectives of the government. The dist-

trthutional

consequences of alternative financing rules will,however,

be central. Indeed financial policy influences real economic variables
largely by affecting the intertemporal and interpersonal (including

intergenerational) distribution of income and wealth. The second justification for financial policy is the identification of instance(s) of
market failure together with the attribution to the government of the

ability

to undertake remedial welfare-improving actions that private

agents either cannot undertake or do not find in their own perceived
self—interest to undertake.
The market "imperfections" central to

an appreciation of the

potential welfare-improving role of financial policy are capital market
imperfections.

incompleteness of the set of

markets (or the absence of a full set of Arrow—Debreu securities)

is due to the "technological" constraint that the dead cannot consume
goods and services and the

legal constraint that private agents cannot

impose binding financial obligations on the unborn. In real life this

3

non-existence of certain forward

of

markets

is augmented by a

wide array

capital market imperfections. Private agents are constrained in

spending plans by the illiquidity and non-marketability of
certain assets such as pension rights and human capital (including
their

cuts) . Collateral requirements limit access

credit. These cash flow constraints, liquidity constraints, lack

of suitable collateral, non-marketability of certain assets and a host
of similar capital market imperfections need not take the form of strict
credit rationing but may instead merely be reflected in a market price
of credit that is in excess of its shadow price.

My inability to borrow on the same terms as the U.K. government

is of course not in and of itself evidence of market failure. Recent
applications of the theory of market equilibrium under asymmetric
Information to credit markets (see e.g. Webb [1981], Stiglitz and Weiss
[1981, 1983 1)

however, have shown how adverse selection or moral hazard

can generate privately rational but socially inefficient equilibria that
may be characterized by credit rationing, excessive spreads between lending
and borrowing rates, etc.

Granted the existence of significant and persistent capital

market imperfections, does the "opportunity set" of the government
differ from and in certain respects dominate that of private agents?
In the overlapping generations model already referred to, there are
two

features

that differentiate private and public possibility sets.

First, the institution of government is longer-lived than the individual

4

private agents. Frequently endowed with eternal life, governments can,
in these models, enter into contracts that extend beyond the life-span

of

any given generation. In this way governments can be a substitute

for some of the non—existent forward markets. Second, the authorities

have the power to tax, i.e. the power to impose unrequited charges or
payments

on

individuals. For good reasons, governments are exceedingly

of thith power

and discourage

private agents from assuming this

prerogative which is classified as theft when exercised on private
initiative.

The

power to tax enables the government to redistribute income

between members of the same generation at a point in time, over time

for an (a group of) individual(s) and between generations.

This power

tax is also the reason why, in an uncertain world, governments can

and improving indirectly the quality of all public debt. Most of the
other differences between private and public opportunity sets referred

o in the literature derive from the greater longevity of the institut2/

ion

of government and the government's power to tax.

The view of

government financial policy I am advocating has governments acting as

a superior financial intermediary, changing the composition of private
sector portfolios over time and altering private disposable income flows.
Well—designed policy interventions of this kind exploit the government's
"comparative advantage" in borrowing to smooth out income

streams and

facilitate risk sharing. By exploiting its position as the "natural
borrower", or borrower of first resort, governments can minimize the

extent to which disposable income, current cash flow and the portfolio

of liquid, marketable or realizeable assets become binding constraints
on private consumption, investment, production and portfolio allocation
decisions.

This view of financial policy is at the opposite end of the spectrum
from the ancient "debt neutrality" position as restated by Barro [1974]

(see also Buiter [1979, l980a] and Carmichael [1982]). Debt neutrality,

i.e. invariance of the real solution trajectaries of the economy underchanges in the borrowing—taxation mix, prevails if financial policy
cannot affect the intertemporal (including the intergenerational) distribution

of income and terms of trade. With infinite-lived households or,
equivalently, finite-lived

households characterized by

any or all of these exceedingly restrictive assumptions causes

Relaxing

this Modigliani—Miller theorem for the public sector to break down and a

potential

welfare-improving role for active financial policy to emerge.

Active financial policy is most easily defined as the orthogonal

complement of passive financial policy. Passive financial policy I
define as balanced budget financial policy, i.e. a continuous or period—

by-period matching of receipts and expenditures. Weakly passive financial
policy permits balanced budget redistribution; strictly passive financial
policy compels taxes and taxes net of transfers and subsidies to be the

same. It is well—known that, e.g. in the over-lapping generations model
of Diamond [1965] , a balanced budget social security scheme implemented

through lump sum taxes on the young and lump—sum transfer payments to the

old will depress capital formation. Most balanced budget intertemporal
or intergenerational redistribution schemes can be reproduced in terms of
their effects on all real endogenous variables by unbalanced budget policies

involving public sector borrowing or lending. e.g. the social security
scheme

just mentioned is isomorphic to government borrowing with debt

service financed by new debt issues and by lump sum

therefore identify active financial

with policies that permit, under specified conditions, systematic

and predictable departures from budget balance.

Active financial policy, as just defined, has a wide range of functions

7

and. consequences, only a few of which can be considered here. By
influencing the interpersonal, intertemporal and intergenerational
distribution of income it will affect risk sharing, the extent to
which households can smooth consumption over the life cycle and capital

formation. All this can occur in models in which current goods and
labour markets clear continuously. I shall discuss this briefly in
Section II. If lump sum taxes are not feasible, the timing of distortionary
taxes will influence to total excess burden or dead weight loss imposed

on the economy. The same will hold if tax collection costs in any given
period are a more than linearly increasing function of the marginal or

average tax rate in that period. This is considered in Section III.
Again this applies in labour and output market clearing models.

For models with a strong new classical flavour, it has been established
that various contingent or conditional financial rules (monetary or
fiscal feedback rules) which are, in general, inconsistent with continuous
budget balance, will alter the joint distribution function of real
economic variables by changing the information content of currently observed
prices when there is incomplete information about the current state (Weiss
[1980] ,

Turnovsky

[1980 1

, Buiter

[l980b, 1981 1).

While of some theoretical

interest, this financial stabilization channel appears to be of secondary
practical importance and I shall not consider it any further here.

In a world with persistent labour market and/or output market disequil-.
ibriuin, the capital market imperfections that are the sine qua non of

financial policy spill over into the markets for output and labour.

E.g.

the existence of the multiplier, which is due to the inclusion of current

8

disposable

income as an argument in the private consumption function,

over and above its contribution to permanent income, reflects a

cpital market imperfection -

the

difficulty of borrowing against the

security of anticipated future labour

income.

In a fixed price model

the operation of the multiplier amplifies the effect of demand shocks

on output and employment. Financial policy entailing temporary deficits

3/
may be the appropriate government response.

The balanced budget

multiplier theorem would appear to suggest that any desired response to

demand

shocks can be achieved without deficits by varying both exhaustive

public spending and taxes net of transfers. I would argue that, to a
first order approximation, optimal budgetary stabilization policy of this
kind

would involve varying taxes and transfers in response to demand

shocks while leaving the path of public consumption and investment spending

unchanged. The intuitive reasons for this are that if public sector
consumption spending is worthwhile, it is worthwhile

regardless of the

demand shocks that afflict the economy and that the time profile

public sector capital formation is dictated within rather narrow

limits by the time profile of future planned public sector production.
The government's spending programme on goods and services should be
designed to achieve the best feasible public—private consumption mix out

of permanent national income. The tax-transfer-borrowing and money
creation rules should be aimed at optimizing national permanent income,
keeping private disposable income in line with private permanent income
and ensuring an adequate share of disposable, realizable (financial)

such illiquid assets as human capital.

The above

policies and

applies to the optimai design of exhaustive spending

financing policies. If, as in the U.K. today, certain

categories of public spending (especially public sector capital
formation) have been cut to levels that are well below

most reasonable

notions of optimality and if at the same time a "Keynesian" fiscal
boost

to aggregate demand is desirable, both structural (or allocative)

and stabilization purposes can be served by a larger volume of spending
on goods and services (social overhead capital formation and investment

in some of the nationalized industries in the U.K.). In Section IV I
review briefly some of the well—known arguments .about the role of

deficits

and debt in short run stabilization policy when

disequilibrium

there is

in labour and product markets.

Concern about debt and deficits on the part of the authorities tends
to derive from two alleged consequences of public sector deficits. First,

to the extent that deficits are monetized they are feared to lead to
inflation. Second, to the extent that they are not monetized but financed
by

issuing interest—bearing debt, they are feared to "crowd out" interest-

sensitive private spending, especially private capital formation. This

"crowding out" can occur either through uard pressure on real interest
rates caused by additional borrowing or by displacing private capital
formation at given real interest rates, as in Sargent and Wallace [1981 1

(see also Buiter [1982a, b; 1983 1

). Section

V considers in

some depth the

10

"eventual monetization" implied by the government's fiscal and financial
4/
—
plans and the long-term financial crowding out
implications of the

government'sbudgetary and monetary policy. While these issues belong
to the domain of positive rather than normative fiscal and financial

policy, they are of considerable practical interest. On the principle
that feasibility is a prerequisite for optimality Section V therefore
analyses the sustainability, consistency and credibility of fiscal,

financial and monetary policy. The comprehensive net worth and permanent
income of the public sector are two central concepts in this analysis.

II.

Financial policy with lump—sum taxes and transfers when goods markets
and factor markets clear.

Using the analytical framework of the simple overlapping generations

model without intergenerational gift and bequest motives, Stiglitz [1983a,b
establishes the following propositions for the case where unrestricted

lump sum

taxes and transfers are possible

and output and factor markets

clear.

Proposition I (Stiglitz 1983a)
An increase in the government deficit has neither real nor inflationary
effects so long as the associated changes in (lump sum) taxes are distribution

I only consider the familiar financial crowding out issue. Other forms
of "direct" crowding out due to compleinentarity or substitutability
between private and public consumption and investment etc. are not
dealt with (see Buiter [1977] ).

11

neutral and so long as the debt will eventually be reduced to its
original level.

Proposition II (Stiglitz 1983b)

A temporary change in the structure (maturity composition, nature
and degree of index linking, etc.) of the public debt has no real or
price level effects provided it is accompanied with the appropriate
lump sum taxes/subsidies to avoid any distributive effects.

Proposition III (Stiglitz 1983a, b)

A change in the interest rate paid on (unindexed) government debt
financed by a change in the supply of such debt has price level effects
but no real effects.

Note that all these propositions apply to an economy in which there

is no explicit or implicit transactions technology. Government debt has
a store of value function only; there is no special medium of exchange or
means of payment function for a subset of the public sector's financial
liabilities, i.e. there are no monetary assets. "Inflation" in Stiglitz's
models is a decline in the price of public debt in terms of real output.

The first two propositions give the conditions under which the Modigliani-

Miller theorem for the public sector holds in this economy. The third
propositionis the familiar classical dichotomy.

12

The interest of Propositions I —

III lies

in the extreme restrict-

iveness of the conditions under which financial policy will be neutral.

Stiglitz goes on to show that

Proposition IV (Stiglitz 1983a)

Any anticipated changes in financial policy other than those
described in propositions I, II and III have both real and price level

effects on the economy. Any unanticipated change has no real effects
on the economy only if

it doesn't change individual's subjective

probability distributions concerning future government financial policy
and if all changes in debt are accompanied by changes in lump—sum taxes
and subsidies to neutralize any distributional consequences.

Having established the non-neutrality of "almost all" financial
policy actions or rules, the design of optimal financial policy can

be tackled. Since the class of models under consideration is rather
far removed from practical applications, I shall limit the discussion
to two aspects of optimal financial policy.

Government

debt and private capital formation

In the Diamond version of the overlapping

generations model, debt

issues

involve redistribution from the young to the old. This depresses

saving

and capital formation in the short run and lowers the steady—

state capital-labour ratio. In such economies private decentralized
decision making can result in equilibria in which the real interest rate

13

is below the natural growth rate. This dynamic inefficiency can be
eliminated by issuing government debt to absorb excessive private

saving. If the real interest rate exceeds the growth rate such Pareto—
improving financial policies are not feasible. Given the government's
social welfare function (which would typically be strictly increasing
in the welfare of each generation), social welfare improving financial

policy actions may still exist. E.g. budget surpluses and government
lending can boost capital formation. The welfare loss this imposes on
those currently old may be more than compensated for by the welfare gains

of

the young and

future generations.

of

Optimal intertemporal risk distribution schemes

The effects of

financial policy on private capital formation occur

even without uncertainty. In a stochastic environment government financial
policy

can generate changes in the intertemporal (and specifically the

intergenerational)

distribution of risk. In the

two period overlapping

generations model, individuals of different generation cannot trade risks
in the market place. The longevity of the institution of government

permits intergenerational risk sharing through the public debt—tax-transfer
mechanism. A detailed analysis can be found in Stiglitz (1983a, b) who

shows that the optimal (in terms of an individualistic social welfare
5/
function ) intertemporal distribution of wealth and risk can be implemented,

at a constant price level, through financial policy involving only a single

5. Stiglitz [1983a] uses a social welfare function that is the discounted
sum of each generation's utility. The proposition about optimal intergenerational

risk sharing transcends this specific parameterization.

taxes and transfers. When lump—sum taxes

and transfers cannot

fully adapted to individual characteristics, the existence of a

variety

of public sector debt instruments is potentially welfare improving.

The time profile of debt and deficits under optimal financial policy
will be a function of all taste and technology parameters in the economy,
of the stochastic shocks disturbing it and of the authorities' objective

functional. Generalizations are impossible other than the rather self—
evident one that a policy of continuous budget balance is likely to be
optimal under a set of conditions of measure zero.

III. Financial policy with distortionary taxes and transfers when goods markets
and factor markets clear.

Recently Barrow [1979, 1981] and Kydland and Prescott [1980] have
applied a well known "uniform taxation" theorem in public finance to
the macroeconomic problem of optimal public sector debt

and deficits in

an economy with continuous full employment. In the absence of uncertainty
and given suitable symmetry, homogeneity and separability assumptions,
it is optimal to levy wage taxes at a constant proportional rate throughout
an individual's lifetime. (See Sandmo [1974, 1976] , Sadka [1977] and

Atkinson

and Stiglitz [1980 1).

The

argument

assumes the

non-availability

of lump sum taxes and subsidies. The original public finance literature
was formulated in terms of the deadweight loss or excess burden of fiscal

15

programs involving distortionary taxes, whose minimization (under fairly
strict conditions) required the equalization of planned tax rates over

the present and the future. Barro's papers consider the possibility of
tax collection costs being an increasing and strictly convex function
6/

of the ratio of the net total tax take to the tax base.

Even in non-

stochastic models, a rigorous statement has not been given of the
conditions under which the result holds true that the optimal total tax
take as a proportion of GDP (or of labour income?) is constant over time,
for an economy with the real—world plethora of direct and indirect taxes,

taxes on labour and capital income and taxes on wealth. For a stochastic
environment,

rate solution translates approximately into a Martingale

in the government budget constraint and the independence of the tax
base from collection costs and the time path of taxes. (See Kremers
[1983] )

16

equation (1) follows. An important (and implausible) restriction this
7/

imposes is that of non-stochastic discount rates.

-

Many empirical as well as conceptual problems stand in the way of
a direct application of (1) to normative or positive policy design.

How does one approximate the "average marginal tax rate" that belongs

in equation (1)? What is the proper tax base to relate the tax rate
to? Should one use taxes or taxes net of transfers and subsidies, as
the theory suggests?

In spite of these and other objections to the strict "uniform
expected tax rates over time" proposition, the notion that it is
optimal to smooth planned tax rates relative to planned exhaustive
public spending because collection costs and/or excess burdens increase

In
more than linearly with the tax rate, is likely to be robust.
the strict

version of equation (1) the theory implies that a temporary

increase in public spending unaccompanied by a matching increase in

real output (the tax base) should be financed at least in part by
borrowing. A transitory increase in real output will, given public
spending, be associated with a budget surplus. The "countercyclical"

IV. Optimal debt and deficits when labour and output markets don't clear
The Keynesian arguments for running larger deficits (smaller
surpluses) when

(larger

effective

demand is depressed and smaller deficits

surpluses) when effective demand is buoyant are familiar.

Tax cuts in the face of negative demand shocks (or the "automatic"
decline of taxes and rise in transfer payments when economic activity
falls, that is written into most existing tax and benefit laws) help

maintain disposable income. To the extent that disposable income rather
than permanent income is the binding constraint on private demand, such
active financial policy helps dampen fluctuations in output and employment.

In Keynesian models, with workers off their notional labour supply
schedules and possibly also firms off their notional demand curves for
labour, avoiding demand—induced swings in real activity is sensible
policy.

By reducing taxes (net of transfers) and increasing borrowing during
the downswing, exhaustive public spending during the downswing will be
financed to a larger extent by private agents who are not constrained by
current disposable income —

demand will
fall

the

purchasers of the bonds.

Total consumption

therefore decline by less than if taxes, which I assume to

equally on disposable-income—constrained and permanent income—constrained

20

private

agents, had been kept constant during the downswing.

When the

economy recovers, the additional debt incurred during the downswing can

be repaid out of higher than normal taxes. The demand effects of
cyclical tax cuts during the downswing and

tax

increases during the

upswing may not be symmetric if, as seems likely, more private agents
are constrained in their spending by current disposable income during
the

downswing than during the upswing.

The smoothing out of consumption over the cycle permitted by counter-

cyclical financial policy would be

desirable because of its intertemporal

allocative effects even if product and factor markets cleared. Its
virtues are enhanced by the initial demand—disturbance-amplifying presence
of labour and output market disequilibrium.

when used for cyclical stabilization, successful financial policy
should not imply any trend increase in the real stock of debt or in the

debt—output ratio. If real interest rates are increasing functions of
current and anticipated future deficits,the transitory and reversible
deficits that are associated with countercyclical policy should have but

minor effects on real interest rates. Thus, by raising the level of
activity, countercyclical deficits absorb private saving in the short run

without lowering the capital stock in the long run. If real interest rate
determination is more myopic, even short run and reversible increases in
deficits and debt may lead to significant crowding out of interest-

sensitive private spending. In most existing macromodels such crowding
out can be avoided by monetizing part of the deficit. Provided this

21

monetization is reversed (and is expected to be reversed) in proper
countercyclical fashion during the upswing, it

should

have no effect

on trend monetary growth and thus on inflationary expectations.

For the sake of completeness, I will conclude this section with the
familiar reminder that there are no "model—free' measures of the short—

run

effect

of fiscal or financial policy on aggregate demand. Neither

the uncorrected or raw deficit, nor the cyclically corrected deficit,
nor the cyclically and inflation—corrected deficit nor the permanent

deficit of Section V are proper measures of fiscal impact. The "demandweighted" (i.e. marginal-propensity-to-spend-on-domestic-output_adjusted),
cyclically corrected deficit calculated e.g. in the U.K. by the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research, as well as the "demand-

weighted", cyclically adjusted and inflation corrected deficit calculated
for the U.K. by Buiter and Miller [1983] are appropriate indices of the

would be to simulate one's preferred model of the economy under different
values of fiscal and financial policy parameters and to call the difference
between the solution trajectories (or the statistics describing them)
the measure of fiscal impact. These fiscal stance measures will therefore
a) be model—specific, b) have time subscripts attached to them and c) be
functions of when a particular fiscal or financial action (or rule change)
was first anticipated, of its anticipated degree of permanence and of the
degree of confidence with which these expectations are held.

10. In the case of Buiter and Miller [1983] the "inflation correction",
or more appropriately, the debt service correction, presupposes that
private financial intermediaries transform current interest payments
from governments into permanent (disposable) real interest income flows
to households.

V. Longer—run aspects of the fiscal and monetary stance:
sustainability, consistency and credibility

-

Preoccupation with the current budget deficit or public sector

borrowing

requirement (PSBR) can be criticized for a variety of

reasons. First, the budget deficit is likely to be a poor or even
perverse indicator of the short—run cyclical demand effects of

spending and taxation policy. Second the size or change of the deficit
bears no straightforward relation to the allocative or structural

effects of government spending and tax programmes. A third major
reason for not paying too much attention to the PSBR is that it

conveys little or no information on the

sustainability of the

fiscal stance, i.e. on the consistency of long—term budgetary spending—
taxation plans, monetary targets and financial crowding out objectives.
The level or change in the current deficit are uninformative as to
the credibility of the government's budgetary, debt and

monetary policy.

In what follows I combine the comprehensive accounting framework
developed in Buiter [19831 with the permanent cost of debt service
approach of Miller (Miller 11982] ,

Miller

and Babbs [1983 1).

With this

apparatus one can address the following issues. First, can previously
planned spending programmes be financed, given projected real output
growth, without raising explicit tax rates or increasing seigniorage

(the inflation tax)? Second, what is the "eventual monetization"
implied by the fiscal stance, i.e. is the government's anti-inflationary

monetary stance fiscally compatible and credible? Third, given the

23

spending and taxation plans and the monetary target, is there likely to
be financial "crowding in" our "crowding out", i.e. is there a tendency
for the real stock of interest bearing debt to fall or to rise (relative
to trend output)?

To evaluate.sustainability and consistency we complement the government budget constraint given in (2) by a comprehensive public sector

grew at the natural rate,

the entire decline (increase) in the public sector net worth-GNP ratio would
come about through an increase (reduction) in the interest—bearing debt—GNP

ratio. In most models not exhibiting debt neutrality, such an increase
(decrease) in the "debt burden" causes financial crowding out (crowding in).
The degree arid time pattern of this financial crowding out (in) will of

course be model specific. A simple model with full crowding out is given in

Even if PK(t) = 1, a programme satisfying (6') which would keep the
expected public sector net worth-trend GDP ratio constant, implies
anticipated variations in the share of public consumption in trend net

output, if the short real interest rate varies over time. An alternative
and more desirable approach, following Hicksian permanent income notions,
starts from the constraint (assumed to hold with strict equality) that

the present value of public consumption must not exceed W(t), i.e.

by the construction of an empirical proxy for W. For DW(t) we multiply
this by the short real rate interest net of the natural rate of growth;

for D(t) the real consol coupon yield net of the natural rate of growth

must be estimated. Even more informative would be a complete calculation
of both sides of (7). As this involves projecting the entire course of
future public consumption spending, it is also more difficult in practice.

At this stage, a piecemeal approach to the calculation of

required to obtain a better

are the following:

(a) "Cyclical" corrections to tax receipts and transfer payments.
The yield from several major taxes (income taxes, national
insurance contributions, VAT, corporation tax) varies inversely
with cyclical deviations of economic activity from its full

employment, trend or natural level. The opposite correlation
holds for such transfer payments as unemployment benefits. Cyclical
corrections to the conventionally measured deficit are, from
this

perspective, desirable not because they provide a better

approximation to the short—run demand effect of the budget, but as

one step
or

towards

the calculation of public sector permanent income

of the permanent deficit.

35

16 /

In

Table 1 I use the IMP's

estimates

of the cyclical correction.

These are very conservative in that they do not assign a zero
cyclical correction to 1979 but instead assume the cyclically
corrected deficit to be 2.3% of GDP larger than the actual deficit
in 1979 and 1.4% of GDP in 1980.

This seems to indicate an expectation of a normal unemployment

rate in the U.K. of 8 or 9 per cent. The Institute of Fiscal
17/
on the other hand, while coming up with very similar
Studies,
year—to—year changes in the cyclical correction, puts its level

2 to 2½ percentage points of GDP higher. What matters for the
sustainability

calculation is that a reasonable proxy for the

expected average future levels of capacity utilization and unemployment be used. These levels may well be functions of the fiscal
policies adopted by the authorities and need not be equal to any
"natural" or "full employment" values.

(b)

There may be planned, projected or expected changes in the scale

and scope of certain tax and benefit programmes. E.g. under existing
legislation governing contributions and benefits, the greying of
the U.K. population implies a growing excess of pension payments

over contributions. Similar concerns have been voiced in the U.S.
While one could try to make some further rough structural or demographic
corrections to the "cyclically corrected" tax and transfer total,
I have not done so in Table I.

Adopting

the IFS cyclical correction instead of the one calculated

by the IMP would lower the permanent deficit by 2 to 2½ per cent of GDP

compared to the figures in the last column of Figure II. Together with
a slightly more generous estimate of the permanent income from North Sea
oil this would generate a 5 or 6 per cent of GDP permanent surplus in

1982. This would leave room for a sizeable sustainable increase in the
share of public consumption spending in trend GDP over its current level

and/or a cut in taxes or increase in transfer payments. Alternatively
the government could choose to indulge in a bout of financial "crowding
int',

using its "permanent" surplus to reduce the real stock of interest—

bearing debt. The U.K. economy, unlike the USA, would appear to have

lots

of fiscal elbow room.

monetary growth is governed in steady state by the trend public

sector current account (or consumption account) deficit, with debt service
evaluated at the real interest rate net of the natural rate of growth.

This deficit measure can differ dramatically from the conventionally
measured public sector financial deficit or PSER, which is often and
erroneously taken as an indicator to eventual monetization. (See Sargent

Conclusion

Bringing

together in an integrated analytical framework the many

heterogeneous perspectives on debt and deficits that were touched upon

in

this paper is left as an exercise for the reader. What is apparent

even now is that the theory of macroeconomic policy design, as it
relates to public spending, taxation, debt management, social security,

and monetary and exchange rate policy, is a branch of the theory of

public finance, albeit a rather underdeveloped branch. Most traditional
public finance theory has been restricted to the case of Wairasian,

market—clearing economies with a complete set of markets. Most macroeconomic
analysis, except for some simple supply—side economics, ignores the efficiency
aspects of fiscal and financial policy.

harmful

The arbitrary and indeed very

dichotomy between "macroeconomic" stabilization policy — using

fiscal and financial instruments to minimize deviations from full

employment equilibrium — and "public finance" allocative or structural

policy —

altering

the full employment equilibrium — can no longer be

justified.

Both the "classical" and the "Keynesian" approaches to financial
policy reviewed in this paper force one to conclude that a balanced
budget policy is very likely to be harmful in a wide range of circumstances.

42

While mere sound economic analysis is unlikely to convince those who
are firmly committed to a balanced budget, it may help persuade a
sufficient number of uncommitted citizens of the need to ban this
spectre of false fiscal responsibility.
