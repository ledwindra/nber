Introduction

We introduce an algorithm for solving dynamic economic models that merges stochastic simulation and projection approaches: we use simulation to approximate the
ergodic measure of the solution, we construct a fixed grid covering the support of the
constructed ergodic measure, and we use projection techniques to accurately solve
the model on that grid. The grid construction is the key novel piece of our analysis:
we select an -distinguishable subset of simulated points that covers the support of
the ergodic measure roughly uniformly. The proposed algorithm is tractable in problems with high dimensionality (hundreds of state variables) on a desktop computer.
As an illustration, we solve one- and multicountry neoclassical growth models and a
large-scale new Keynesian model with a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.
One stream of literature for solving dynamic economic models relies on stochastic
simulation. This stream includes the methods for solving rational expectations models, e.g., Fair and Taylor (1983), Marcet (1988), Smith (1993), Maliar and Maliar
(2005), Judd, Maliar and Maliar (2011), as well as the literature on learning, e.g.,
Marcet and Sargent (1989), Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996), Pakes and McGuire
(2001), Powell (2011). The key advantage of stochastic simulation methods is that
the geometry of the set on which the solution is computed is adaptive. Namely, such
methods solve economic models on a set of points realized in equilibrium which makes
it possible to avoid the cost of finding the solution in areas of the state space that are
eﬀectively never visited in equilibrium. However, a set of simulated points itself is
not an eﬃcient choice either as a grid for approximating a solution (it contains many
closely-located and hence, redundant points) or as a set of nodes for approximating
expectation functions (the accuracy of the Monte Carlo integration method is low).
Another stream of literature for solving dynamic economic models relies on projection techniques; see, e.g., Wright and Williams (1984), Judd (1992), Christiano
and Fisher (2000) and Kruger and Kubler (2004). Projection methods use eﬃcient
discretizations of the state space and eﬀective deterministic integration methods, and
they deliver very accurate solutions. However, conventional projection methods are
limited to fixed geometries such as a multidimensional hypercube. In order to capture
all points that are visited in equilibrium, a hypercube must typically include large
areas of the state space that have a low probability to happen in equilibrium. The
size of the hypercube domain, on which projection methods operate, grows rapidly
with the dimensionality of the problem.
We propose a solution method that combines the best features of stochastic simulation and projection methods, namely, it combines an adaptive geometry of stochastic simulation methods with eﬃcient discretization techniques of projection methods.
2

The grid we construct covers the high-probability area of the state space roughly uniformly. In Figure 1a and Figure 1b, we show a two-dimensional example of such a
grid.

The technique we use to construct the grid in the figure is called an -distinguishable
set (EDS) technique, and it consists in constructing a set of points, which are situated
at the distance at least  from one another, where   0 is a parameter. In this
paper, we establish computational complexity, dispersion, cardinality and degree of
uniformity of the EDS grid constructed on simulated series. Furthermore, we perform
the worst-case analysis, and we relate our results to recent mathematical literature on
covering problems (see, Temlyakov, 2011) and random sequential packing problems
(see, Baryshnikov et al., 2008).
Our construction of the EDS grid relies on the assumption that a solution to
the model is known. Since the solution is unknown in the beginning, we proceed
iteratively: guess a solution, simulate the model, construct an EDS grid, solve the
model on that grid using a projection method, and iterate on these steps until the
grid converges.
We complement the eﬃcient EDS grid with other computational techniques suitable for high-dimensional problems, namely, low-cost monomial integration rules and
a fixed-point iteration method for finding parameters of the equilibrium rules. Taken
together, these techniques make the EDS algorithm tractable in problems with high
dimensionality — hundreds of state variables!
We first apply the EDS method to the standard neoclassical growth models with
one and multiple agents (countries). The EDS method delivers accuracy levels comparable to the best accuracy attained in the related literature. In particular, we are
able to compute global quadratic solutions for equilibrium problems with up to 80
state variables on a desktop computer using a serial Matlab software (the running
3

time ranges from 30 seconds to 24 hours). The maximum unit-free approximation
error on a stochastic simulation is always smaller than 001%.
Our second and more novel application is a new Keynesian model which includes
a Taylor rule with a zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates. This model
has eight state variables and is characterized by a kink in equilibrium rules due to the
ZLB. We parameterize the model using the estimates of Smets and Wouters (2003,
2007), and Del Negro et al. (2007). The EDS method is tractable for polynomial
degrees 2 and 3: the running time is less than 25 minutes in all cases considered. For
comparison, we also assess the performance of perturbation solutions of orders 1 and
2. We find that if the volatility of shocks is low and if we allow for negative nominal
interest rate, both the EDS and perturbation methods deliver suﬃciently accurate
solutions. However, if either the ZLB is imposed or the volatility of shocks increases,
the perturbation method is significantly less accurate than the EDS method. In particular, under some empirically relevant parameterizations, the perturbation methods
of orders 1 and 2 produce errors that are as large as 25% and 38% on a stochastic
simulation, while the corresponding errors for the EDS method are less than 5%. The
diﬀerence between the EDS and perturbation solutions is economically significant.
When the ZLB is imposed, the perturbation method considerably understates the
duration of the ZLB episodes and the magnitude of the crises.
The EDS projection method can be used to accurately solve small-scale models
that were previously studied using other global methods.1 However, a comparative
advantage of the EDS algorithm is its ability to solve large-scale problems that
other methods find intractable or expensive. The speed of the EDS algorithm also
makes it potentially useful in estimation methods that solve economic models at
many parameters vectors; see Fernández-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramírez (2007) for a
discussion. Finally, the EDS grid can be used in applications unrelated to solution
methods that require to produce a discrete approximation to the ergodic distribution
of a stochastic process with a continuous density function.
The rest of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, we describe the construction of
the EDS grid and establish its properties. In Section 3, we integrate the EDS grid
into a projection method for solving dynamic economic models. In Section 4, we
apply the EDS algorithm to solve one- and multi-agent neoclassical growth models.
In Section 5, we compute a solution to a new Keynesian model with the ZLB. In
Section 6, we conclude.

A discrete approximation to the ergodic set

In this section, we first introduce a technique that produces a discrete approximation
to the ergodic set of a stochastic process with a continuous density function, we then
establish properties of the proposed approximation, and we finally relate our results
to mathematical literature. Later, we will use the resulting discrete approximation
as a grid of a projection-style solution method.

2.1

A class of stochastic processes

We focus on a class of discrete-time stochastic processes that can be represented in
the form
+1 =  (  +1 ) 
 = 0 1 
(1)
where  ∈  ⊆ R is a vector of  independent and identically distributed shocks,
and  ∈  ⊆ R is a vector of  (exogenous and endogenous) state variables. The
distribution of shocks is given by a probability measure  defined on a measurable
space ( E), and  is endowed with its relative Borel -algebra denoted by X.
Many dynamic economic models have equilibrium laws of motion for state variables that can be represented by a stochastic system in the form (1). For example, the
standard neoclassical growth model, described in Section 4, has the laws of motion for
capital and productivity that are given by +1 =  (   ) and +1 =  exp (+1 ),
respectively, where +1 ∼ N (0  2 ),   0 and  ∈ (−1 1); by setting  ≡ (   ),
we arrive at (1).
To characterize the dynamics of (1), we use the following definitions.
Def 1. A transition probability is a function P :  ×  → [0 1] that has two
properties: (i) for each measurable set A ∈ X, P (· A) is X-measurable function;
and (ii) for each point  ∈ , P ( ·) is a probability measure on ( X).
Def 2. An (adjoint) RMarkov operator is a mapping M∗ :  →  such that
+1 (A) = (M∗  ) (A) ≡ P ( A)  ().
Def 3. An invariant probability measure  is a fixed point of the Markov operator
M∗ satisfying  = M∗ .
Def 4. A set A is called invariant if P ( A) = 1 for all  ∈ A. An invariant
set A∗ is called ergodic if it has no proper invariant subset A ⊂ A∗ .
Def 5. An invariant measure  is called ergodic if either  (A) = 0 or  (A) = 1
for every invariant set A.
These definitions are standard to the literature on dynamic economic models; see
Stokey, Lucas and Prescott (1989). P ( A) is the probability that the stochastic
system (1) whose today’s state is  =  will move tomorrow to a state +1 ∈ A. The
5

Markov operator M∗ maps today’s probability into tomorrow’s probability, namely,
if  (A) is the probability that the system (1) is in A at , then (M∗  ) (A) is
the probability that the system will remain in the same set at  + 1. Applying the
operator M∗ iteratively, we can describe the evolution of the probability starting
from a given 0 ∈ X. An invariant probability measure  is a steady state solution
of the stochastic system (1). An invariant set A is the one that keeps the system
(1) forever in A, and an ergodic set A∗ is an invariant set of the smallest possible
size. Finally, an invariant probability measure is ergodic if all the probability is
concentrated in just one of the invariant sets.
The dynamics of (1) produced by economic models can be very complex. In
particular, the Markov process (1) may have no invariant measure or may have multiple invariant measures. These cases represent challenges to numerical methods that
approximate solutions to dynamic economic models. However, there is another challenge that numerical methods face — the curse of dimensionality. The most regular
problem with a unique, smooth and well-behaved solution can become intractable
when the dimensionality of the state space gets large. The challenge of high dimensionality is the focus of our analysis. We employ the simplest possible set of
assumptions that allows us to expose and to test computational techniques that are
tractable in high-dimensional applications.
Assumption 1. There exists a unique ergodic set A∗ and the associated ergodic
measure .
Assumption 2. The ergodic measureR admits a representation in the form of
a density function  :  → R+ such that A  ()  =  (A) for every A ⊆ X.
Let us comment on these assumptions. The existence of invariant probability
measure  follows by Krylov-Bogolubov theorem under assumptions of a"tightness"
and weak continuity (Feller property) of the operator (M∗ ); see Stachursky (2009,
Theorem 11.2.5). The "tightness" assumption can be replaced with an assumption
that  is compact; see Stokey, Lucas and Prescott (1989, Theorem 12.10). The
existence and uniqueness of the ergodic probability measure require far more restrictive assumptions such as Doeblin and strong "mixing" type of conditions; see
Stokey, Lucas and Prescott (1989, Theorems 11.9 and 11.10, respectively). Finally,
the existence of a density function is equivalent to the existence of Radon-Nykodim
derivative of  with respect to the Lebesgue measure; see, e.g., Stachursky (2009,
Theorem 9.1.18).

2.2

A two-step EDS technique for approximating the ergodic set

We propose a two-step procedure for forming a discrete approximation to the ergodic
set. First, we identify an area of the state space that contains nearly all the probability mass. Second, we cover this area with a finite set of points that are roughly
evenly spaced.
2.2.1

An essentially ergodic set

We define a high-probability area of the state space using the level set of the density
function.
Def 6. A set A ⊆ A∗ is called a -level ergodic set if   0 and
A ≡ { ∈  :  () ≥ } 

R
The mass of A under the density  () is equal to  () ≡ ()≥  () . If  () ≈ 1,
then A contains all  except for points where the density is lowest, in which case
A is called an essentially ergodic set.
By construction, the correspondence A : R+ ⇒ R maps  to a compact set. The
correspondence A is upper semi-continuous but may be not lower semi-continuous
(e.g., if  is drawn from a uniform distribution [0 1]). Furthermore, if  is multimodal,
then for some values of , A may be disconnected (composed of disjoint areas).
Finally, for   max { ()}, the set A is empty.

Our approximation to the essentially ergodic set builds on stochastic simulation
and relies on the law of iterated logarithm. Formally, let  be a set of  independent
random draws 1    ⊆ R generated with the distribution function  : R → R+ .
For a given subset  ⊆ R , we define  ( ; ) as a characteristic function that counts
the number of points from  in . Let J be a family generated by the intersection
of all subintervals of R of the form Π=1 [−∞  ), where   0.
Proposition 1 (Law of iterated logarithm). For every  and every continuous function , we have

That is, the empirical distribution function 
b () ≡ (;) converges asymptotically
to the true distribution function  () for every  ∈ J at the rate given in (2).
We use the following algorithm to select a subset of simulated points that belongs
to an essentially ergodic set A .
(Algorithm A ): Selection of points within an essentially ergodic set.
Step 1. Simulate (1) for  periods.
Step 2. Select each th point to get a set  of  points 1    ∈  ⊆ R .
Step 3. Estimate the density function b ( ) ≈  ( ) for all  ∈  .
Step 4. Remove all points for which the density is below .

In Step 2, we include in the sample  only each th observation to make random
draws (approximately) independent. As concerning Step 3, there are various methods
in statistics that can be used to estimate the density function from a given set of
data; see Scott and Sain (2005) for a review. We use one of such methods, namely,
a multivariate kernel algorithm with a normal kernel which estimates the density
function in a point  as

 (2)2  =1

where  is the bandwidth parameter, and  (  ) is the distance between  and  .
The complexity of Algorithm A is  (2 ) because it requires to compute pairwise
distances between all the sample points. Finally, in Step 3, we do not choose the
density cutoﬀ
R  but a fraction of the sample to be removed, , which is related to 
by  () = ()≥  ()  = 1 − . For example,  = 005 means that we remove 5%
of the sample which has the lowest density.
2.2.2

An -distinguishable set (EDS)

Our next objective is to construct a uniformly-spaced set of points that covers the
essentially ergodic set (to have a uniformly-spaced grid for a projection method).
We proceed by selecting an -distinguishable subset of simulated points in which all
points are situated at least on the distance  from one another. Simulated points are
not uniformly-spaced but the EDS subset will be roughly uniform, as we will show
in Section 2.3.
Def 7. Let ( ) be a bounded metric space. ¡A set ¢  consisting of points

1    ∈  ⊆ R is called -distinguishable if       for all 1 ≤   ≤
 :  6= , where   0 is a parameter.
8

EDSs are used in mathematical literature that studies the entropy; see Temlyakov
(2011) for a review. This literature focuses on a problem of constructing an EDS
that covers a given subset of R (such as a multidimensional hypercube). We study
a diﬀerent problem, namely, we construct an EDS for a given discrete set of points.
To this purpose, we introduce the following algorithm.
(Algorithm   ): Construction of an EDS.
Let  be a set of  point 1    ∈  ⊆ R .
Let   begin as an empty set,   = {∅}.
Step 1. Select  ∈  . Compute  (   ) to all  in  .
Step 2. Eliminate from  all  for which  (   )  .
Step 3. Add  to   and eliminate it from  .
Iterate on Steps 1-3 until all points are eliminated from  .

The cost of this algorithm is assessed below.
Proposition 2 The complexity of Algorithm   is of order  ().
Proof. Consider the worst-case scenario for the complexity. We take 1 ∈  ,
compute  − 1 distances to all other points and obtain that all such distances are
larger than  so that no point is eliminated. Further, we take 2 ∈  , compute  − 2
distances to all other points and again, no point is eliminated. We proceed till  ∈
 for which we compute  −  distances. Thus, the first  points are placed into
  . Subsequently, we eliminate the remaining −
scenario, the
P points. Under this
(+1)
complexity is ( − 1) + ( − 2)  + ( − ) = =1 ( − ) =  −
≤ .
2
When no points are eliminated from  , i.e.,  = , the complexity is quadratic,
 (2 ). However, the number of points  in an EDS is bounded from above if 
is bounded; see Proposition 4. This means that asymptotically, when  → ∞, the
complexity of Algorithm   is linear,  ().
2.2.3

Distance between points

Both estimating the density function and constructing an EDS requires us to measure
the distance between simulated points. Generally, variables in economic models have
diﬀerent measurement units and are correlated. This aﬀects the distance between
the simulated points and hence, aﬀects the resulting EDS. Therefore, prior to using
Algorithm A and Algorithm   , we normalize and orthogonalize the simulated data.
9

To be specific, let  ∈ R× ¡be a set ¢of simulated data normalized to zero
mean and unit variance. Let  ≡ 1    be an observation  = 1 (there are 

observations), and let  ≡ 1    be a variable  (there are  variables), i.e.,
¡
¢
 = 1    = (1    )> . We first compute the singular value decomposition
of , i.e.,  =  > , where  ∈ R× and  ∈ R× are orthogonal matrices, and
 ∈ R× is a diagonal matrix.¡We then perform
a linear transformation of  using
¢
PC≡  . The variables PC= PC1   PC ∈ R× are called principal components

(PCs) of , and are orthogonal (uncorrelated), i.e., PC

principal components PC1  PC are normalized to unit variance.
2.2.4

An illustration of the EDS technique

In this section, we will illustrate the EDS technique described above by way of example. We consider the standard neoclassical growth model with a closed-form solution
(see Section 4 for a description of this model). We simulate time series for capital
and productivity level of length 1 000 000 periods, and we select a sample of 10 000
observations by taking each 100th point (to make the draws independent); see Figure 2a. We orthogonalize the data using principal component (PC) transformation,
and we normalize the PCs to unit variance; see Figure 2b. We estimate the density
function using the multivariate kernel algorithm with the standard bandwidth of
 = −1(+4) , and we remove from the sample 5% of simulated points in which the
density is the lowest; see Figure 2c. We construct an EDS; see Figure 2d. We plot
such a set in the PC and original coordinates in Figure 2e and Figure 2f, respectively.
As we see, the EDS technique delivers a set of points that covers the same area as
does the set of simulated points but that is spaced roughly uniformly.2 In Section
2.3, we will characterize the properties of the constructed EDS analytically.
2

Our two-step procedure produces an approximation not only to the ergodic set but also to the
ergodic distribution (because in the first step, we estimate the density function in all simulated
points including those that form an -distinguishable set). The density weights show what fraction
of the sample each "representative" point represents, and can be used to construct weighted-average
approximations. Given our purpose to construct a set of evenly-spaced points, we do not use the
density weights, treating all points equally.

10

2.2.5

Other procedures for approximating the ergodic set

We have described one specific procedure for forming a discrete approximation to the
essentially ergodic set of stochastic process (1). Below, we outline other procedures
that can be used for this purpose.
First, our two-step procedure has a complexity of order  (2 ) because the kernel
algorithm computes pairwise distances between all observations in the sample. This
is not a problem for the size of applications we study in the present paper, however,
it might be expensive for larger samples. In Appendix A, we describe a procedure
that has a lower complexity, namely,  (). We specifically invert the steps in the
two-step procedure: we first construct an EDS on all simulated points, and we then
remove from the EDS those points where the density is low.
Second, we can use methods from cluster analysis to select a set of representative
points from a given set of simulated points (instead of constructing an EDS). Namely,
we partition the simulated data into clusters (groups of closely-located points), and
we replace each cluster with one representative point. This technique is exposed
in Appendix B using two clustering methods, an agglomerative hierarchical method
and K-means method.3

2.3

Properties of EDSs

In this section, we characterize the dispersion of points, the number of points, and
the degree of uniformity of the constructed EDS. Also, we discuss the relation of our
results to recent mathematical literature.
2.3.1

Dispersion of points in the EDS

We borrow the notion of dispersion from the literature on quasi-Monte Carlo optimization methods; see, e.g., Niederreiter (1992, p.148) for a review. Dispersion
measures are used to characterize how dense is a given set of points in a given area
of the state space.
Def 7. Let  be a set consisting of points 1    ∈  ⊆ R , and let ( ) be
a bounded metric space. The dispersion of  in  is given by
 ( ; ) = sup inf  (  ) 
∈ 1≤≤

3

(4)

The clustering methods were used to produce all the numerical results in the earlier versions of
the paper, Judd et al. (2010, 2011). In the current version of the paper, we switch to EDSs because
their properties are easier to characterize analytically and their construction has a lower cost. In
our examples, projection methods operating on cluster grids and those operating on EDSs deliver
comparable accuracy of solutions.

11

where  is a (Euclidean) metric on .
Let  (; ) denote a ball with the center  and radius . Then,  ( ; ) is the
smallest possible radius  such that the family of closed balls  (1 ; )    ( ; )
covers .
Def 8. Let  be a sequence of elements on , and let 1    ∈  ⊆ R be the
first  terms of . The sequence  is called low-dispersion if lim  (; ) = 0.
→∞
In other words, a sequence  is low-dispersion if it becomes increasingly dense
when  → ∞. Below, we establish bounds on the dispersion of points in an EDS.
Proposition 3 Let  be any set of  points 1    ∈  ⊆ R with a dispersion  ( ; )  . Let ( ) be a bounded metric space, and let   be an EDS
1    constructed by Algorithm   . Then, the dispersion of   is bounded by
   (  ; )  2.
Proof. The first equality follows
for each  ∈   , Algorithm   removes
¡ because
¢

all points  ∈  such that      . To prove the second inequality, let us
assume that  (  ; ) ≥ 2 toward a contradiction. ¡
¢
(i) Then, there is a point  ∈  for which inf     ≥ 2, i.e., all points

(ii) An open ball  (; ) contains at least one point ∗ ∈  . This is because
 ( ; )   implies inf  (  )   for all , i.e., the distance between any point
 ∈

 ∈  and its closest neighbor from  is smaller than .
(iii) Algorithm   does not eliminate ∗ . This algorithm eliminate only those
points around all  ∈   that are situated on the distance smaller than , whereas
any point inside  (; ) is situated
larger than  from any  ∈   .

Then,  must belong to EDS   . Since ∗ ∈  (; ), we have  ( ∗ )    2,
a contradiction.
Proposition 3 states that any  ∈  has a neighbor  ∈   which is situated at
most at the distance 2. The dispersion of points in an EDS goes to zero as  → 0.
2.3.2

Number of points in the EDS

The number of points in an EDS is unknown a priory. It depends on the value of 
and the order in which the points from  are processed. Temlyakov (2011, Theorem
12

3.3 and Corollary 3.4) provides the bounds on the number of points in a specific class
of EDSs, namely, those that cover a unit ball with balls of radius . We also confine
our attention to a set  given by a ball, however, in our case, balls of radius  do
not provide a covering of . The bounds for our case are established in the following
proposition.
Proposition 4 Let  be any set of  points 1    ∈  (0 ) ⊆ R with a dispersion  ( ; )  . Then, the number of points in   constructed by Algorithm  
¡  ¢
¡
¢
is bounded by 2
≤  ≤ 1 +  .

Proof. To prove the first inequality, notice that, by Proposition 3, the balls  (1 ; 2)
   ( ; 2) cover . Hence, we have  (2) ≥   , where  is the volume
of a -dimensional unit ball. This gives the first inequality.
To prove the second inequality, we consider an EDS on  (0; ) that has the
maximal cardinality  max . Around each point of such a set, we construct a balls
with the radius . By definition, the distance between any two points in an EDS is
larger than , so the balls  (1 ; )    ( ; ) are all disjoint. To obtain an upper
bound on , we must construct a set that encloses all these balls. The ball  (0; )
does not necessarily contain all the points from these balls, so we add an open ball
 (0; ) to each point of  (0; ) in order to extend the frontier by . This gives us a
set  (0;  + ) =  (0; )⊕ (0; ) ≡ { :  =  +   ∈  (0; )   ∈  (0; )}. Since
the ball  (0;  + ) encloses the balls  (1 ; )    ( ; ) and since  ≤  max ,
we have  () ≤  ( + ) . This yields the second inequality.
In some applications, we need to construct an EDS that has a given target number
of points  (for example, in a projection method, we may need a grid with a certain
number of grid points). To this purpose, we can use a simple bisection method. We
2
fix 1 and 2 such that  (1 ) ≤  ≤  (2 ), take  = 1 +
, construct an EDS
2
and find  (); if  ()  , then we set 1 =  and otherwise, we set 2 = ,
and proceed iteratively until  () converges to some limit (which was close to the
target value  in our experiments). To find the initial values of 1 and 2 , we
−1
and
use the ³
bounds established
in Proposition 4, namely, we set 1 = 051 
´
1

−1

2 = 2  − 1
, where 1 and 2 are, respectively, the largest and smallest
PCs of the simulated points (since the essentially ergodic set is not necessarily a
hypersphere, as is assumed in Proposition 4, we take 1 and 2 to be the radii of
the limiting hyperspheres that contain none and all PCs of the simulated points,
respectively).

2.3.3

Discrepancy

We now analyze the degree of uniformity of EDSs. The standard notion of uniformity
in the literature is discrepancy from the uniform distribution; see Niederreiter (1992,
p. 14).
Def 10. Let  be a set consisting of points 1    ∈  ⊆ R , and let J
be a family of Lebesgue-measurable
subsets ¯of . The discrepancy of  under J
¯
¯ ( ;)
¯
is given by D ( ; J ) = sup ¯  −  ()¯, where  ( ; ) counts the number of
∈J

points from  in , and  () is a Lebesgue measure of .
D ( ; J ) measures the discrepancy between the fraction of points (;) contained in , and the fraction of space  () occupied by . If the discrepancy is low,
D ( ; J ) ≈ 0, the distribution of points in  is close to uniform. The measure of
discrepancy commonly used in the literature is the star discrepancy.
Def 11. The star discrepancy D∗ ( ; J ) is defined as the discrepancy of  over
the family  generated by the intersection of all subintervals of R of the form
Π=1 [−∞  ), where   0.
Let  be a sequence of elements on , and let 1    ∈  ⊆ R be the
first  terms of . Niederreiter
³ (1992, p.´ 32) suggests to call a sequence  low∗
discrepancy if D (; J ) =  −1 (log ) , i.e., if the star discrepancy converges to
zero asymptotically at a rate at least of order −1 (log ) .
The star discrepancy of points which are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution [0 1] converges to zero asymptotically, lim D∗ (; J ) = 0, a.e. The rate
→∞
of convergence follows directly from the law of iterated logarithm stated in Proposition 1, and it is (log log )12 (2)−12 ; see Niederreiter (1992, p. 166-168) for a
general discussion on how to use Kiefer’s (1961) results for assessing the discrepancy
of random sequences.
If a sequence is a low-discrepancy one, then it is also a low-dispersion one; see
Niederreiter (1992, Theorem 6.6). Indeed, a sequence that covers  uniformly must
become increasingly dense everywhere on  as  → ∞. However, the converse is not
true. A sequence that becomes increasingly dense on  as  → ∞ does not need to
become increasingly uniform since density may be distributed unevenly. Thus, the
result of Proposition 3 that the dispersion of an EDS converges to zero in the limit
does not mean that its discrepancy does so.
Nonetheless, we can show that for any density function , the discrepancy of an
EDS is bounded on a multidimensional sphere.

(  ; B) is defined as the discrepancy of 
over the family  generated by the intersection of -dimensional open balls  (0; )

Proposition 5 Let  be any set of  points 1    ∈  (0; 1) ⊆ R with a dispersion  ( ; )  . Then, the discrepancy

Relation to mathematical literature

We now compare our results to mathematical literature that focuses on related problems.
2.4.1

Existence results for a covering-number problem

Temlyakov (2011) studies the problem of finding a covering number — a minimum
number of balls of radius  which cover a given compact set (such as a -dimensional
hypercube or hypershpere). In particular, he shows the following result. There exists
an EDS   on a unit hypercube [0 1] whose star discrepancy is bounded by
∗
D
(  ; J ) ≤  · 32 [max {ln  ln }]12  −12 

15

(5)

where  is a constant; see Temlyakov (2011, Proposition 6.72). The discrepancy
of such an EDS converges to 0 as  → ∞ (i.e.,  → 0). However, constructing
an EDS with the property (5) is operationally diﬃcult and costly. Also, Temlyakov
(2011) selects points from a compact subset of R , and his analysis cannot be directly
applied to our problem of finding an -distinguishable subset of a given finite set of
points.
2.4.2

Probabilistic results for random sequential packing problems

Probabilistic analysis of an EDS is non-trivial because points in such a set are spatially dependent: once we place a point in an EDS, it aﬀects the placement of all
subsequent points.
Some related probabilistic results are obtained in the literature on a random
sequential packing problem.4 Consider a bounded set  ⊆ R and a sequence of
-dimensional balls whose centers are i.i.d. random vectors 1    ∈  with a
given density function . A ball is packed if and only if it does not overlap with
any ball which has already been packed. If not packed, the ball is discarded. At
saturation, the centers of accepted balls constitute an EDS. A well-known unidimensional example of this general problem is a car-parking model of Rényi (1958). Cars
of a length  park at random locations along the roadside of a length 1 subject to
a non-overlap with the previously parked cars. When cars arrive at uniform random positions, Rényi (1958) shows that they occupy about 75% of the roadside at
jamming (namely, the expected value is lim []  ≈ 0748).
→0

For a multidimensional case, Baryshnikov et al. (2008) show that the sequential
packing measure, induced by the accepted balls centers, satisfies the law of iterated
logarithm (under some additional assumptions). This fact implies that the discrepancy of EDS converges to 0 asymptotically if the density of points in an EDS is
uniform in the limit  → 0. However, the density of points in an EDS depends on
the density function  of the stochastic process (1) used to produce the data (below,
we illustrate this dependence by way of examples). Hence, we have the following negative conclusion: an EDS needs not be uniform in the limit even in the probabilistic
sense (unless the density function is uniform).
4

This problem arises in spacial birth-growth models, germ-grain models, percolation models,
spacial-graphs models; see, e.g., Baryshnikov et al. (2008) for a review.

16

2.4.3

Our best- and worst-case scenarios

One-dimensional versions of our Propositions 4 and 5 have implications for Rényi’s
(1958) car parking model. Namely, Proposition 4 implies that the cars occupy between 50% and 100% of the roadside ( 12 ≤ lim ≤ 1). These are the best- and
→0
worst-case scenarios in which the cars are parked on the distances  and 0 from each
other, respectively. (In the former case, evil drivers park their cars to leave as little
parking space to other drivers as possible, and in the latter case, a police oﬃcer directs the cars to park in a socially eﬃcient way). The density functions that support
the worst- and best-scenarios are the ones that contain the Dirac point masses on
the distances 2 and , respectively.
Proposition 5 yields
the worst-case scenario for discrepancy in√ Rényi’s (1958)
√

model, D ( ; B) ≤ √2+1 ≈ 017, which is obtained under ∗ = √2+1
. This bound
is attainable. Indeed, consider an EDS on [0 1] such that on the interval [0 ∗ ],
all points are situated on a distance , and on [∗  1], all points are situated on the
∗

distance 2. In the first interval, we have 2 ≤  ≤ 2 + 1 points and in the second

by Proposition 5. To support this scenario, we assume that  has the Dirac point
masses on the distances  and 2 in the intervals [0 ∗ ] and [∗  1], respectively.
When the dimensionality increases, our bounds become loose. Proposition 4
¡ ¢
implies 12 ≤ lim ≤ 1 which means that  can diﬀer by a factor of 2 under
→0
the worst- and best-case scenarios; for example, when  = 10,  can diﬀer by a

However, we cannot improve upon the general results of Propositions 4 and 5: our
examples with Dirac point masses show that there exist density functions  under
which the established bounds are attained.

Incorporating the EDS grid into projection methods

We refer to the set of points produced by the two-step procedure of Section 2.2 as
an EDS grid. In this section, we incorporate the EDS grid into projection methods
for solving dynamic economic models, namely, we use the EDS grid as a set of points

17

on which the solution is approximated.

3.1

Comparison of the EDS grid with other grids in the
literature

Let us first compare the EDS grid to other grids used in the literature for solving dynamic economic models. We must make a distinction between a geometry
of the set on which the solution is computed and a specific discretization of this
set. A commonly-used geometry in the related literature is a fixed multidimensional
hypercube. Figures 3a-3d plot 4 diﬀerent discretizations of the hypercube: a tensorproduct Chebyshev grid, a low-discrpancy Sobol grid, a sparse Smolyak grid and
a monomial grid, respectively (in particular, these grids were used in Judd (1992),
Rust (1998), Krueger and Kubler (2004), and Pichler (2011), respectively).
An adaptive geometry is an alternative used by stochastic simulation methods;
see Marcet (1988), Smith (1993), Maliar and Maliar (2005), Judd et al. (2011) for
examples of methods that compute solutions on simulated series.5 Focusing on the
right geometry can be critical for the cost, as the following example shows.
Example. Consider a vector of uncorrelated random variables  ∈ R drawn from
a multivariate Normal distribution  ∼ N (0  ), where  is an identity matrix. An
essentially ergodic set A has the shape of a hypersphere. Let us surround such a
hypersphere with a hypercube of a minimum size. For dimensions 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 30
and 100, the ratio of the volume of a hypersphere to the volume of the hypercube
is equal to 079, 052, 031, 016, 3 · 10−3 , 2 · 10−14 and 2 · 10−70 , respectively. These
numbers suggest that an enormous savings in cost are possible by focusing on an
essentially ergodic set instead of the standard multidimensional hypercube.
However, a stochastic simulation is not an eﬃcient discretization of the high-probability
set: a grid of simulated points is unevenly spaced, has many closely-located, redundant points and contains some points in low-density regions.
The EDS grid is designed to combine the best feature of the existing grids. It
combines an adaptive geometry (similar to the one used by stochastic simulation
methods) with an eﬃcient discretization (similar to that produced by low-discrepancy
methods on a hypercube). In Figure 3e, we show an example of a cloud of simulated
points of irregular shape, and in Figure 3f, we plot the EDS grid delivered by the
two-step procedure of Section 2.2. As we can see, the EDS grid appears to cover the
high-probability set uniformly.
5

For a detailed description of Marcet’s (1988) method, see Marcet and Lorenzoni (1999).

18

Tauchen and Hussey (1991) propose a related discretization technique that delivers an approximation to a continuous density function of a given stochastic process.
Their key idea is to approximate a Markov process with a finite-state Markov chain.
This discretization technique requires to specify the distribution function of the
Markov process explicitly and is primarily useful for forming discrete approximations of density functions of exogenous variables. In contrast, the EDS discretization
technique builds on stochastic simulation and does not require to known the distribution function. It can be applied to both exogenous and endogenous variables.
There are cases in which the EDS grid is a good choice. First, focusing on a
high-probability set may not have advantages relatively to a hypercube; for example,
if a vector  ∈ R is drawn from a multivariate uniform distribution,  ∼ [0 1] ,
then an essentially ergodic set coincides with the hypercube [0 1] , and no saving
in cost is possible. Second, in some applications, one may need to know a solution
outside the high-probability set, for example, when analyzing a transition path of
a developing economy with a low initial endowment. Finally, there are scenarios in
which EDSs have large discrepancy as shows the worse-case analysis of Section 2. We
did not observe the worst-case outcomes in our experiments. However, if the density
of simulated points is highly uneven (e.g., Dirac point masses), the distribution of
points in an EDS may be also uneven. If we know that we are in those cases, we
may opt for other grids such as a grid on a multidimensional hypercube.

3.2

General description of the EDS algorithm

In this section, we develop a projection algorithm that uses the EDS grid for solving
equilibrium problems. It is also possible to use the EDS grid in the context of
dynamic-programming problems (we show an application in Section 4.3).
3.2.1

An equilibrium problem

We study an equilibrium problem in which a solution is characterized by the set of
equilibrium conditions for  = 0 1     ∞,
 [ (      +1  +1  +1 )] = 0

(7)

where (0  0 ) is given;  denotes the expectations operator conditional on information available at ;  ∈ R is a vector of endogenous state variables at ;  ∈ R is
a vector of exogenous (random) state variables at ;  ∈ R is a vector of non-state
variables — prices, consumption, labor supply, etc. — also called non-predetermined
19

variables;  is a continuously diﬀerentiable vector function; +1 ∈ R is a vector of
shocks. A solution is given by a set of equilibrium functions +1 =  (   )  and
 =  (   ) that satisfy (6), (7) in the relevant area of the state space. In terms
of notations of Section 2.1, we have  = (  ),  = (   ) and  =  +  . The
solution (  ) is assumed to satisfy the assumptions of Section 2.1.
3.2.2

A projection algorithm based on the EDS grid

Our construction of the EDS grid in Section 2.2 is based on the assumption that the
stochastic process (1) for the state variables is known. However, the law of motion for
endogenous state variables is unknown before the model is solved: it is precisely our
goal to approximate this law of motion numerically. We therefore proceed iteratively:
guess a solution, simulate the model, construct an EDS grid, solve the model on that
grid using a projection method, and iterate on these steps until the grid converges.
Below, we elaborate a description of this procedure for the equilibrium problem (6),
(7).

Choices related to the construction of the EDS grid

We construct the EDS grid as described in Section 2.2. We guess the equilibrium rule
b simulate the solution for  periods, construct a sample of  points by selecting
,
each th observation, estimate the density function, remove a fraction  of the sample
with the lowest density, and construct an EDS grid with a target number of points
 using a bisection method. Below, we discuss some of the choices related to the
construction of the EDS grids.
Initial guess on  . To insure that the EDS grid covers the right area of the
state space, we need a suﬃciently accurate initial guess about the equilibrium rules.
Furthermore, the equilibrium rules used must lead to nonexplosive simulated series.
For many problems in economics, linear solutions can be used as an initial guess; they
are suﬃciently accurate, numerically stable and readily available from automated
perturbation software (we use Dynare solutions; see Adjemian et al., 2011).
The choices of  and  . Our construction of an EDS relies on the assumption
that simulated points are suﬃciently dense on the essentially ergodic set. Namely,
in Proposition 2, we assume that each ball  (; ) inside A contains at least one
simulated point. The probability Pr (0) of having no points
R in a ball  (; ) inside


A after  draws satisfies Pr (0) ≤ (1 −  ) where  ≡ (;)  ≈    and 
is the volume of a -dimensional unit ball. (Note that on the boundary of A where
 = , we have Pr (0) = (1 −  ) ). Thus, given  and , we must choose  and
 =  so that Pr (0) is suﬃciently small. We use  = 100 000 and  = 10, so that
our sample has  = 10 000 points, and we choose  to remove 1% of points with the
lowest density.
The choices of  and . We need to have at least as many grid points in the EDS
as the parameters  and  in b and b (to identify these parameters). Conventional
projection methods rely on collocation, when the number of grid points is the same
as the number of the parameters to identify. The collocation is a useful technique in
the context of orthogonal polynomial constructions but is not applicable to our case
(because our bisection method does not guarantee that the number of grid points is
exactly equal to the target number ). Hence, we target slightly more points than
the parameters, which also helps to increase both accuracy and numerical stability.
Convergence of the EDS grid. Under Assumptions 1 and 2, the convergence of
the equilibrium rules implies the convergence of the time-series solution; see Peralta21

Alva and Santos (2005). Therefore, we are left to check that the EDS grid©constructed
ª
on the simulated series also converges. Let Γ0 ≡ {0 }=1 0 and Γ00 ≡ 00 =1 00
be the EDS grids constructed ¡on two¢ diﬀerent sets of simulated points. Our criteria
of convergence is sup inf
 0  00  2. That is, each grid point of Γ00 has a grid
0
0
00  ∈Γ
00
 ∈Γ

point of Γ0 at the distance smaller than 2 (this value is used because it matches
the maximum distance between the grid points on the essentially ergodic set; see
Proposition 3).
3.2.4

Other choices in the EDS algorithm

The innovative feature of the projection algorithm of Section 3.2.2 is the EDS grid.
The rest of the choices (such as a family of approximating functions, integration
method, fitting method, etc.) should be made in a way that is suitable for a specific
application. In making these choices, we must take into account the trade-oﬀ between
accuracy, computational cost, numerical stability and programming eﬀorts. Below,
we identify several techniques that are particularly eﬀective for high-dimensional applications (in conjunction with the EDS grid) and that are very simple to implement.
First, we approximate the unknown equilibrium rules using standard ordinary
polynomials. Such polynomials are cheap to construct and can be fitted to the data
using simple and reliable linear approximation methods.
Second, we rely on deterministic integration methods such as the Gauss-Hermite
quadrature and monomial integration methods. Deterministic methods dominate
in accuracy the Monte Carlo method by orders of magnitude in the context of the
studied numerical examples; see Judd et al. (2011) for comparison results.6 The
cost of Gaussian product rules is prohibitive but monomial formulas are tractable
in problems with very high dimensionality (even in models with hundreds of state
variables). In particular, we use monomial formulas whose cost grows only linearly
or quadratically with the number of shocks.
Finally, we solve the system of equations in Step 2 using a fixed-point iteration
method, namely, we find the parameters vector in approximating functions on iteration  + 1 as (+1) = b() + (1 − ) () , where b() and () are the parameters vectors

For example, assume that a Monte Carlo method is used to approximate

and  = 10 000, we have approximation errors of order √ = 10−4 . To bring the error to the level
of 10−8 , which we attain using quadrature methods, we need to have  = 1012 . That is, a slow

simulation.

in the beginning and the end of iteration  and  ∈ (0 1]. For a fixed EDS grid, we
consider the solution as being converged when the diﬀerence between the approximating functions on two consecutive iterations is smaller then a given value. The
cost of fixed-point iteration does not practically increase with the dimensionality of
the problem.
3.2.5

Evaluating the accuracy of solutions

Provided that the EDS algorithm succeeds in producing a candidate solution, we
subject such a solution to a tight accuracy check. We specifically generate a set of
points within the domain on which we want the solution to be accurate, and we
compute residuals in all equilibrium conditions.

If the quality of a candidate solution is economically inacceptable, we modify the
choices made in the EDS algorithm (i.e., simulation length, number of grid points,
approximating functions, integration method) and recompute the solution. In the
paper, we evaluate the accuracy on a set of simulated points. This new set of points is
diﬀerent from that used in the solution procedure: it is constructed under a diﬀerent
sequence of shocks. Other possible accuracy checks include an evaluation of residuals
in the model’s equations on a given set of points in the state space (Judd, 1992), and
testing the orthogonality of residuals in the optimality conditions (Den Haan and
Marcet, 1994); see Santos (2000) for a discussion.
3.2.6

Potential problems

An EDS grid is an eﬀective grid for high-dimensional problems, however, the EDS algorithm shares the limitations of projection methods. In particular, the combination
of computational techniques described above does not guarantee the convergence;
and even if the algorithm converges, there is no guarantee that it converges to the
23

true solution. Below, we outline some problems that may arise in applications and
discuss how these problems can be addressed.
First, stochastic simulation can produce explosive time series under high-degree
polynomials. To restore the numerical stability, we may try to use other better
behaved families of approximating functions or to restrict the equilibrium rules to
satisfy certain growth limits (e.g., concavity, monotonicity, non-negativity).
Second, local perturbation solutions may be not a suﬃciently accurate initial
guess, and the resulting EDS grid may not represent correctly the essentially ergodic
set. Finding a suﬃciently good initial guess can be a non-trivial issue in some
applications, and techniques from learning literature can be useful here; see Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis (1996) for a discussion.
Third, fixed-point iteration may fail to converge. Newton methods are more
reliable in the given context but they also do not guarantee finding a solution. Globalsearch techniques are a useful but expensive alternative.
Finally, small residuals in the equilibrium conditions do not necessarily mean that
we found the solution. For certain models, equilibrium may fail to exist; see Santos
(2002) for examples. Furthermore, a candidate solution may be a minimum or just
a regular point rather than a maximum, and the analysis of second-order conditions
may be needed. Also, there could be multiple equilibria; see Feng et al. (2009) for
related examples and their treatment.
In all our examples, the projection method based on the EDS grid was highly
accurate and reliable, however, the reader must be aware of the existence of the
above potential problems and must be ready to detect and to address such problems
if they arise in applications.

Neoclassical stochastic growth model

In this section, we use the EDS approach to solve the standard neoclassical stochastic growth model. We discuss some relevant computational choices and assess the
performance of the algorithm in one- and multi-agent setups.

 () = ln (),  = 1 and  () =  , the model admits a closed-form solution
+1 =   (this solution was used to produce Figures 1 and 2).

4.2

An EDS algorithm iterating on the Euler equation

We describe an example of the EDS method that iterates on the Euler equation. For
the model (8)—(10), the Euler equation is
1 () =  [1 (0 ) (1 −  + 0 1 (0 ))] 

(11)

where primes on variables denote next-period values, and  denotes a first-order
derivative of a function  with respect the th argument. Under the Euler equation
approach, we must solve for equilibrium rules  =  ( ) and  0 =  ( ) that
satisfy (9)—(11).
In Table 1, we provide the results for the Euler equation EDS algorithm under
the target number of grid points  = 25 points.
The accuracy of solutions delivered by the EDS algorithm is comparable to the
highest accuracy attained in the related literature. The residuals in the optimality
conditions decrease with each polynomial degree by one or more orders of magnitude.
For the fifth-degree polynomials, the largest unit-free residual corresponding to our
least accurate solution is still less than 10−6 (see the experiment with a high degree
of risk aversion  = 5). Most of the cost of the EDS algorithm comes from the
construction of the EDS grid (the time for constructing the EDS grids is included in

the total time for computing the polynomial solution of degree 1). Computing highdegree polynomial solutions is relatively fast (a few seconds) for a given grid. We
perform sensitivity experiments in which we vary the target number of grid points
and find that the results are robust to the modifications considered. We also vary the
number of nodes in the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, and we find that even the 2node rule leads to essentially the same accuracy levels as the 10-node rule (except the
fourth and fifth-degree polynomials under which the accuracy is somewhat lower).
This result is in line with the finding of Judd (1992) that in the context of the
standard growth model, even few quadrature nodes lead to very accurate solutions.
Autocorrection of the EDS grid. Suppose our initial guess about the essentially
ergodic set is poor. To check whether the EDS grid is autocorrecting, we perform the
following experiment. We scale up the time-series solution for capital by a factor of
10, and use the resulting series for constructing the first EDS grid (thus, the capital
values in this grid are spread around 10 instead of 1). We solve the model on this grid
and use the solution to construct the second EDS grid. We repeat this procedure
two more times. Figure 3 shows that the EDS grid converges rapidly.

26

We tried out various initial guesses away from the essentially ergodic set, and
we observed autocorrection of the EDS grid in all the experiments performed. Furthermore, the EDS grid approach was autocorrecting in our challenging applications
such as a multi-agent neoclassical growth model and a new Keynesian model with a
zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Note that the property of autocorrection
of the grid is a distinctive feature of the EDS algorithm. Conventional projection
methods operate on fixed domains and have no built-in mechanism for correcting
their domains if the choices of their domains are inadequate.
EDS grid versus Smolyak grid. Krueger and Kubler (2004), and Malin, Krueger
and Kubler (2011) develop a projection method that relies on a Smolyak sparse grid.
Like conventional projection methods, Smolyak’s method operates on a hypercube
domain (and, hence, the size of the domain grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the state space). However, it uses a specific discretization of the hypercube
domain which yields a sparse grid of carefully selected points (the number of points
in the Smolyak grid grows only polynomially with the dimensionality of the state
space).
We now compare the accuracy of solutions under the Smolyak and EDS grids.7
We construct the Smolyak grid as described in Malin et al. (2011), namely, we use the
7

Also, the Smolyak and EDS methods diﬀer in the number of grid points (collocation versus
overidentification), the polynomial family (a subset of complete Chebyshev polynomials versus a
set of complete ordinary polynomials), the interpolation procedure (Smolyak interpolation versus
polynomial interpolation) and the procedure for finding fixed-point coeﬃcients (time iteration versus
fixed-point iteration). These diﬀerences are important; for example, time iteration is more expensive
than fixed-point iteration, the collocation is less robust and stable than overidentification.

The Smolyak grid has 13 points (see Figure 3c), so we use the same target number
of points in the EDS grid. With 13 grid points, we can identify the coeﬃcients in
ordinary polynomials up to degree 3. In this case, we evaluate the accuracy of solutions not only on a stochastic simulation but also on a set of 100 × 100 points which
are uniformly spaced on the same domain as the one used by the Smolyak method
for finding a solution. The results are shown in Table 2.
In the test on a stochastic simulation, the EDS grid leads to considerably more
accurate solutions than the Smolyak grid. This is because under the EDS grid, we
fit a polynomial directly in the essentially ergodic set, while under the Smolyak grid,
we fit a polynomial in a larger rectangular domain and face a trade-oﬀ between the
fit inside and outside the ergodic set. However, in the test on the rectangular domain, however, the Smolyak grid produces significantly smaller maximum residuals
than the EDS grid. This is because the EDS algorithm is designed to be accurate
in the essentially ergodic set and its accuracy decreases more rapidly away from the
essentially ergodic set than the accuracy of methods operating on larger hypercube
domains. We repeated this experiment by varying the intervals for capital and productivity in the Smolyak grid, and we have the same regularities. These regularities
are also observed in high-dimensional applications.8

The EDS algorithm iterating on the Bellman equation is successful in finding
polynomial solutions of degrees 2—5 (the polynomial solutions of degree 1 imply a
degenerate case when the equilibrium rules are constant).
The comparison with Table 2 shows that the Bellman equation algorithm produces much larger approximation errors (of order 10−4 − 10−6 ) than the Euler equation algorithm. The accuracy of the Bellman equation method is lower because it
heterogeneous agents. Their findings are the same as ours: on a stochastic simulation and near
the steady state, the CGA solutions are more accurate than the Smolyak solutions whereas the
situation reverses for large deviations from the steady state.

parameterizes the value function (while the Euler equation method parameterizes the
derivative of the value function) and eﬀectively, loses one polynomial degree. Also,
the Bellman equation is much faster.

4.4

EDS algorithm in problems with high dimensionality

We now explore the tractability of the EDS algorithm in problems with high dimensionality. We extend the one-agent model (8)—(10) to include multiple agents, which
is a simple way to expand and to control the size of the problem. There are  agents,
interpreted as countries, which diﬀer in initial capital endowment and productivity
levels. The countries’ productivity levels are aﬀected by both country-specific and
worldwide shocks. We study the social planner’s problem. We do not make use of
the symmetric structure of the economy and approximate the planner’s solution in
the form of  capital equilibrium rules, each of which depends on 2 state variables
( capital stocks and  productivity levels). For each country, we use essentially
the same computational procedure as that used in the representative-agent case. For
a description of the multicountry model and details of the computational procedure,
see Appendix D.
Determinants of cost in problems with high dimensionality. The cost of
finding numerical solutions increases with the dimensionality of the problem for various reasons. There are more equations to solve and more equilibrium rules to approximate. The number of terms in an approximating polynomial function increases,
and we need to increase the number of grid points to identify the polynomial coefficients. The number of nodes in integration formulas increases. Finally, operating
with large data sets can slow down computations or can lead to a memory congestion. If a solution method relies on product-rule constructions (of grids, integration
nodes, derivatives, etc.), the cost increases exponentially (curse of dimensionality) as
is in the case of conventional projection methods such as a Galerkin method of Judd
(1992). Below, we show that the cost of the EDS algorithm grows at a relatively
moderate rate.
Accuracy and cost of solutions. We solve the model with  ranging from 2
to 200. The results about the accuracy and cost of solutions are provided in Table
4. We consider four alternative integration rules such as the Gauss-Hermite product
rule with 2 nodes, denoted by  (2), the monomial rule with 2 2 +1 nodes, denoted
by 2, the monomial rule with 2 nodes, denoted by 1, (see Judd, 1998, formulas
7.5.9—7.5.11), and the Gauss-Hermite rule with one node, denoted by  (1).

Table 4. Accuracy and speed in the multicountry model depending on the integration method used.

The accuracy of solutions here is similar to that we have for the one-agent model.
For the polynomial approximations of degrees 1 and 2, the residuals are typically
smaller than 01% and 001%, respectively. A specific integration method used plays
only a minor role in the accuracy of solutions. For the polynomial approximation
of degree 1, all the integration methods considered lead to virtually the same accuracy. For the polynomial approximation of degree 2,  (2), 2 and 1 lead to the
residuals which are identical up to the fourth digit, while  (1) yields the residuals
which are 5 − 10% larger. These regularities are robust to variations in the model’s
parameters such as the volatility and persistence of shocks and the degrees of risk
aversion (see Table 8 in Judd, Maliar and Maliar, 2010, a working-paper version of
the present paper).
The running time ranges from 36 seconds to 24 hours depending on the number of
countries, the polynomial degree and the integration technique used. In particular,
the EDS algorithm is able to compute quadratic solutions to the models with up to
40 countries and linear solutions to the models with up to 200 countries when using
inexpensive (monomial and one-node quadrature) integration rules. Thus, the EDS
algorithm is tractable in much larger problems than those studied in the related literature. A proper coordination between the choices of approximating function and
integration technique is critical in problems with high dimensionality. An example of such a coordination is a combination of a flexible second-degree polynomial
with a cheap one-node Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule (as opposed to an ineﬃcient
combination of a rigid first-degree polynomial with expensive product integration
formulas).

New Keynesian model with the ZLB

In this section, we use the EDS algorithm to solve a stylized new Keynesian model
with Calvo-type price frictions and a Taylor (1993) rule.9 Our setup builds on the
models considered in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), Smets and Wouters
(2003, 2007), Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets and Wouters (2007). This literature
estimates their models using the data on actual economies, while we use their parameter estimates and compute solutions numerically. We solve two versions of the
model, one in which we allow for negative nominal interest rates and the other in
which we impose a zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates.10 The studied
9

In an earlier version of the present paper, Judd et al. (2011) use a cluster-grid algorithm (CGA)
to solve a new Keynesian model which is identical to the one studied here except of parameterization.
10
For the neoclassical growth model studied in Section 4, it would be also intersting to explore
the case with occasionally binding borrowing constraints. Christiano and Fisher (2000) show how

31

model has eight state variables and is large-scale in the sense that it is expensive
or even intractable under conventional global solution methods that rely on product
rules.
The literature that finds numerical solutions to new Keynesian models typically relies on local perturbation solution methods or applies expensive global solution methods to low-dimensional problems. As for perturbation, most papers compute linear approximations, and some papers compute quadratic approximations
(e.g., Kollmann, 2002, and Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2007) or cubic approximations (e.g., Rudebusch and Swanson, 2008). Few papers use global solution methods; see, e.g., Adam and Billi (2006), Anderson, Kim and Yun (2010), and Adjemian and Juillard (2011). The above papers have at most 4 state variables and
employ simplifying assumptions.11 A recent paper of Fernández-Villaverde, Gordon, Guerrón-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramírez (2012) uses a global solution method
(namely, Smolyak’s method) to study the predictions of a model similar to ours, and
it provides an extensive analysis of the economic significance of the ZLB.

The set up

The economy is populated by households, final-good firms, intermediate-good firms,
monetary authority and government; see Galí (2008, Chapter 3) for a detailed description of the baseline new Keynesian model.

Numerical analysis

Methodology. We use the estimates of Smets and Wouters (2003, 2007) and
Del Negro et al. (2007) to assign values to the parameters. We approximate nu−
merically
© the equilibrium rules  =  ( ),ª =  ( ) and  =MU( ) with
 = ∆−1  −1              using the Euler equations (34), (35)
and (38), respectively. We solve for the other variables analytically using the remaining equilibrium conditions. We compute the polynomial solutions of degrees 2
and 3, referred to as EDS2 and EDS3, respectively. For comparison, we also compute first- and second-order perturbation solutions, referred to as PER1 and PER2,
respectively (we use Dynare 4.2.1 software). When solving the model with the ZLB
by the EDS algorithm, we impose the ZLB both in the solution procedure and in
subsequent simulations (accuracy checks). Perturbation methods do not allow us to
impose the ZLB in the solution procedure. The conventional approach in the literature is to disregard the ZLB when computing perturbation solutions and to impose
the ZLB in simulations when running accuracy checks (that is, whenever  happens
to be smaller than 1 in simulation, we set it to 1). A detailed description of the
methodology of our numerical analysis is provided in Appendix E. We illustrate the
EDS grid for the model with the ZLB in Figure 5 where we plot the time-series
¡
¡ solu¢¢
tion and the grids in two-dimensional spaces, namely, (  ∆ ) and   exp   .
We see that many points happen to be on the bound  = 1 and that the essentially
ergodic set in the two figures is shaped roughly as a circle.

36

Accuracy and cost of solutions. Two parameters that play a special role in
our analysis are the volatility of labor shocks  and the target inflation rate  ∗ .
Concerning   , Del Negro et al. (2007) finds that shocks to labor must be as large
as 40% to match the data, namely, they estimate the interval   ∈ [01821, 06408]
with the average of  = 04054. Concerning  ∗ , Del Negro et al. (2007) estimate
the interval  ∗ ∈ [10461 10738] with the average of  ∗ = 10598, while Smets and
Wouters (2003) use the value  ∗ = 1. The inflation rate aﬀects the incidence of the
ZLB: a negative net nominal interest rate is more likely to occur in a low- than a
high-inflation economy.12
In Table 5, we show how the parameters  and  ∗ aﬀect the quality of numerical
solutions. In the first experiment, we assume   = 01821 (which is the lower
bound of the interval estimated by Smets and Wouters, 2003), set  ∗ = 1 and allow
for a negative net interest rate. Both the perturbation and EDS methods deliver
reasonably accurate solutions. The maximum size of residuals in the equilibrium
conditions is about 6% and 2% for PER1 and PER2, respectively (10−121 and 10−164
in the table), and it is less than 1% and 02% for EDS2 and EDS2, respectively
(10−202 and 10−273 in the table). We also report the minimum and maximum values
of  on a stochastic simulation, as well as a percentage number of periods in which
  1. Here,  falls up to 09916, and the frequency of   1 is about 2%.
12

Chung, Laforte, Reifschneider, and Williams (2011) provide estimates of the incidence of the
ZLB in the US economy. Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2009) study the economic significance
of the ZLB in the context of a similar model. Also, Mertens and Ravn (2011) analyze the incidence
of the ZLB in a model with sunspot equilibria.

Table 5. The new Keynesian model: the EDS algorithm versus perturbation algorithm.

We design the next two experiments to separate the eﬀect of the volatility of
labor shocks   and the inflation rate  ∗ = 1 on the quality of numerical solutions.
In the second experiment, we consider a higher volatility of labor  = 04054,
and we set  ∗ = 10598, which is suﬃcient to preclude net nominal interest rates
from being negative. The performance of the perturbation methods worsens dramatically. The residuals in the equilibrium conditions for the PER1 solution are
as large as 25% (10−059 ), and they are even larger for the PER2 solution, namely,
38% (10−042 ). Thus, increasing the order of perturbation does not help increase the
quality of approximation. The accuracy of the EDS solutions also decreases but less
dramatically: the corresponding residuals for the EDS2 and EDS3 methods are less
than 5% (10−131 ) and 1.2% (10−191 ), respectively. For the EDS method, high-degree
polynomials do help increase the quality of approximation.
Finally, in the third experiment, we concentrate on the eﬀect of the ZLB on
equilibrium by setting  ∗ = 1 and by imposing the restriction  ≥ 1 under the
low-volatility   = 01821 of labor shocks assumed in the first experiment. Again,
we observe that the accuracy of the perturbation solutions decreases more than the
accuracy of the global EDS solutions. In particular, the maximum residual for the
PER2 solution is about 5%, while the corresponding residuals for the EDS2 and
EDS3 solutions are less than 2.7% (10−158 ) and 1.6% (10−181 ), respectively.
To appreciate how much the equilibrium quantities diﬀer across the methods,
we report the maximum percentage diﬀerences between variables produced by EDS3
and those produced by the other methods on a simulation of 10,000 observations.
The regularities are similar to those we observed for the residuals. The diﬀerence
between the series produced by PER1 and EDS3 can be as large as 17%; the diﬀerence
between the series produced by PER2 and EDS3 depends on the model: it is about
1% when the ZLB is not imposed in the model with   = 01821 but can reach 10%
when the ZLB is imposed; and finally, the diﬀerence between the series produced
by EDS2 and EDS3 is smaller in all cases (504% at most for the model in which
the ZLB is imposed). Generally, the supplementary variables  and  diﬀer more
across methods than such economically relevant variables as  ,  and  .
Economic importance of the ZLB. Figures 6a and 6b plot fragments of a stochastic simulation when the ZLB is not imposed and imposed, respectively, for the
model parameterized by  = 01821 and  ∗ = 1. When the ZLB is not imposed,
both the perturbation and EDS methods predict 5 periods of negative (net) interest
rates (see periods 4, 6-9 in Figure 6a). When the ZLB is imposed, The EDS method,
EDS2 and EDS3, predict a zero interest rate in those 5 periods, while the perturbation methods, PER1 and PER2, predict a zero interest rate just in 3 periods (see
38

periods 4, 6 and 7 in Figure 6b).

The way we deal with the ZLB in the perturbation solution misleads the agents
about the true state of the economy. To be specific, when we chop the interest rate
at zero in the simulation procedure, agents perceive the drop in the interest rate
as being small and respond by an immediate recovery. In contrast, under the EDS
algorithm, agents accurately perceive the drop in the interest rate as being large and
respond by 5 periods of a zero net interest rate (which correspond to 5 periods of
negative net interest rates predicted in the case when the ZLB is not imposed). The
output diﬀerences between PER2 and EDS3 are relatively small when the ZLB is
not imposed but they become quantitatively important when the ZLB is imposed
and can be as large as 2%.

Lessons. The studied new Keynesian model is a challenging application for any
numerical method. First, the dimensionality of the state space is large; second, the
volatility of exogenous variables is high; and finally, there is a kink in the equilibrium
rules due to the ZLB. We choose this application in order to subject the EDS method
to a tight test that makes it possible to see its limitations.
Our results indicate that the EDS method is able to confront the above challenges.
First, the running time for the EDS method ranges from 4 to 25 minutes; the EDS
method would be tractable in much larger applications, as our results for the multicountry model suggest. Second, the EDS method produces very accurate solutions
if the volatility of shocks is not excessively high, and its accuracy can be increased
using polynomial functions of higher degrees, unlike the accuracy of the perturbation
methods. Finally, in the presence of the ZLB, the perturbation and EDS methods
may produce qualitatively diﬀerent results. The accuracy of both the EDS and
perturbation methods is limited by their use of polynomials, which are not well
suitable for approximating equilibrium rules with kinks. The EDS algorithm may
do better in terms of accuracy if we use functional families that can accommodate
kinks. However, this lies beyond the scope of the present paper.

Conclusion

We introduce a projection algorithm that operates on a high-probability area of the
ergodic set of an economic model. The EDS algorithm is tractable in problems with
much higher dimensionality than those studied in the related literature. In particular,
we are able to compute accurate quadratic solutions to a multicountry growth model
with up to 80 state variables. Furthermore, we are able to compute an accurate
global solution to a new Keynesian model. This model is of particular interest to the
literature as it is used by governments and financial institutions all over the world
for the policy analysis. We find that perturbation methods are not reliable in the
context of new Keynesian models, and we show examples where perturbation and
global solution methods produce qualitatively diﬀerent predictions. We emphasize
that all the numerical results in the paper are obtained using a standard desktop
computer and serial MATLAB software. The speed of the EDS algorithm can be
increased by far using more powerful hardware and software, as well as parallelization
techniques.

Appendix A. A cheaper version of the EDS technique
We show a version of the EDS technique which is cheaper than that described in
Section 2.2. The idea is to invert Steps 1 and 2: we first use Algorithm   to
construct an EDS on all simulated points, and we then use Algorithm A to remove
from the EDS the low-density points. To be more specific, in Step 1, we produce a
set  of  points 1    ∈  ⊆ R by simulation of (1) and select an EDS  
of  points, 1    ; and in Step 2, we estimate density function b
 ( ) ≈  ( )
for all  ∈   and remove from   a subset of points that represents a fraction of
the sample  which has the lowest density. To control the fraction of the sample
removed, we use the estimated density function b
. Note that when eliminating a




(
)

point  ∈   , we remove    of the original sample. We therefore can proceed
=1 (  )
with eliminations of points from the EDS one by one until their cumulative mass
reaches the target value .
An advantage of this version of the EDS technique compared to the baseline one
is its lower cost. In our baseline version, the kernel algorithm computes pairwise
distances between all  simulated points which has the cost of order  (2 ). In
the modified version, the kernel algorithm estimates the density function only in 
points contained in the EDS, and thus it computes the distances from  points to
 points with the cost of order  (). If  ¿ , this may be far smaller than
 (2 ), the complexity of the baseline two-step procedure of Section 2.2.
An illustration of the cheaper version of the EDS technique. To illustrate
the application of the cheaper version of the EDS technique, we use the example of

47

the neoclassical growth model with a closed-form solution studied in Section 2.2.4;
see Figures 7a-7f. We first compute the normalized PCs of the original sample; see
Figure 7b (this step in the same as in Figure 2b). We compute an EDS   on
the normalized PCs; see Figure 7c. We then estimate the density function in all
points of   using the kernel density algorithm. We finally removed from   a set
of points that has the lowest density function and that represents 5% of the sample.
The removed points are represented with crosses in Figure 7d. The resulting EDS
is shown in Figure 7e. Finally, we plot the EDS grid in the original coordinates in
Figure 7f.

Appendix B. Clustering algorithms
Instead of the EDS technique, we can use methods from cluster analysis to construct
a grid for our projection algorithm; see Everitt et al. (2011) for a review of clustering
methods. In this case, we partition the simulated data into clusters (groups of closelylocated points), and we replace each cluster with just one representative point. In
Figures 8a-8c, we show an example in which we partition a set of simulated points
into 4 clusters and construct 4 representative points. A representative point is the
closest point to the cluster center (computed as the average of all observations in the
given cluster).

In this section, we discuss two clustering methods that can be used in the context
of our analysis, an agglomerative hierarchical and K-means ones. The advantage of
clustering methods is that we can control the number of grid points directly (while the
number of points in an EDS depends ¡on ). The drawbacks
are that their complexity
¢
3
+1
is higher (it is of order  ( ) and  
log  for the agglomerative hierarchical
and K-means algorithms, respectively), and that the properties of grids produced by
clustering methods are hard to characterize analytically.
48

As is in the case of the EDS technique, two versions of the clustering technique
can be constructed: we can first remove the low-density points and then construct
representative points using clustering methods (this is parallel to the basic two-step
EDS procedure of Section 2.2), or we can first construct clusters and then eliminate
representative points in which the density function is the lowest (this is parallel
to the cheap version of the two-step procedure described in Appendix A). Prior to
an application of clustering methods, we preprocess the data by constructing the
normalized PCs as we do when constructing an EDS grid in Section 2.2.

Appendix B1. Hierarchical clustering algorithm
A hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm which begins from individual objects (observations) and agglomerates them iteratively into larger objects — clusters.
Distance between groups of observations. As a measure of distance between
two groups of observations (clusters),  ≡ {1    } and  ≡ {1    }, we
use Ward’s measure of distance.13 This measure shows how much the dispersion of
observations changes when clusters  and  are merged together compared to the
case when  and  are separate clusters.
Formally, we proceed as follows:
¡
¢
Step 1. Consider the cluster . Compute the cluster’s center  ≡ 1   L as
P
a simple average of the observations,  ≡ 1 =1  .
Step 2. For each  ∈ , compute distance  (  ) to its own cluster’s center.
Step 3. Compute the dispersion of observations in cluster  as a squared sum of

P
distances to its own center, i.e.,  () ≡
[ (  )]2 .
=1

Repeat Steps 1-3 for cluster  and for the cluster obtained by merging clusters
 and  into a single cluster  ∪ .
Ward’s measure of distance between  and  is defined as
e ( ) =  ( ∪ ) − [ () +  ()] 


(B1)

This measure is known to lead to spherical clusters of a similar size, see, e.g., Everitt
et al. (2011, p. 79). This is in line with our goal of constructing a uniformly spaced
grid that covers the essentially ergodic set. In our experiments, Ward’s measure
13

If a measure of distance between groups of observations does not fulfill the triangular inequality,
it is not a distance in the conventional sense and is referred to in the literature as dissimilarity.

49

yielded somewhat more accurate solutions than the other measures of distance considered, such as the nearest neighbor, furthest neighbor, group average; see, e.g.,
Romesburg (1984) and Everitt et al. (2011) for reviews.
Steps of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. The zeroorder partition P (0) is the set of singletons — each observation represents a cluster.
Step 0. Choose measures of distance between observations and clusters. Choose
, the number of clusters to be created.
Step 1. On iteration , compute all pairwise distances between the clusters in
partition P () .
Step 2. Merge a pair of clusters with the smallest distance into a new cluster.
The resulting partition is P (+1) .
Iterate on Steps 1 and 2. Stop when the number of clusters in the partition is
. Represent each cluster with a simulated point which is closest to the cluster’s
center. Below we illustrate the operation of this algorithm by way of example.
A numerical example of implementing the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. We provide a numerical example that illustrates the construction of clusters under the agglomerative hierarchical algorithm. The sample data
contains 5 observations for 2 variables, 1 and 2 :

We will consider two alternative measures of distance between clusters, the nearestneighbor (or single) and Ward’s ones. Both measures lead to an identical set of
clusters shown in Figure 9. On iteration 1, we merge observations 1 and 3 into a
cluster {1 3}; on iteration 2, we merge observations 4 and 5 into a cluster {4 5}; on
iteration 3, we merge observations 2 and {4 5} into a cluster {2 4 5}; and finally,
on iteration 4, we merge clusters {1 3} and {2 4 5} into one cluster that contains
all observations {1 2 3 4 5}. Below, we describe computations performed by the
clustering algorithm. We first consider the nearest-neighbor measure of distance
which is simpler to understand (because the distance between clusters can be inferred
from the distance between observations without additional computations). We then
50

show how to construct clusters using the Ward’s distance measure, which is our
preferred choice in numerical analysis.

Nearest-neighbor measure of distance. The nearest-neighbor measure of distance between the clusters  and  is the distance between the closest pair of
e ( ) = min  (   ). Let  (   ) =

The smallest non-zero distance for the five observations in 1 is 13 = 05. Thus, we

all observations into a single cluster (thus, the number of clusters existing, e.g., on
iteration 2 is 5 − 2 = 3).

of distance (B1). As an example, consider the distance between the singleton

Appendix B2. K-means clustering algorithm

A K-means clustering algorithm obtains a single partition of data instead of a cluster
tree generated by a hierarchical algorithm. The algorithm starts with  random
clusters, and then moves objects between those clusters with the goal to minimize
variability within clusters and to maximize variability between clusters. The basic
K-means algorithm proceeds as follows:
Step 0. Choose , the number of clusters. Generate randomly  clusters to
obtain initial partition P (0) .
Step
iteration , for each cluster  ∈ P () , determinePthe cluster’s center
¡ 1 1. On
¢
 ≡    L as a simple average of the observations,  ≡ 1 =1  .
Step 2. For each  , compute the distance  (  ) to all clusters’ center.
Step 3. Assign each  to the nearest cluster center. Recompute the centers of
the new  clusters. The resulting partition is P (+1) .
Iterate on Steps 1—3 until convergence.
Unlike the hierarchical clustering algorithm, the K-means algorithm can give
diﬀerent results with each run. This is because the K-means algorithm is sensitive
to initial random assignments of observations into clusters. In this respect, K-means
algorithm is similar to Algorithm   that can produce diﬀerent EDSs depending on
the order in which points are processed.

Appendix C. Neoclassical stochastic growth model

 = 095 and  = 001. We normalize the steady state of capital to one by assuming  = 1−(1−)


10th point so that  = 10 000. The damping parameter is  = 01, and the convergence parameter is  = 10−11 . In Algorithm EE and Algorithm BE, we parameterize the capital equilibrium rule and value function, respectively, using complete ordinary polynomials of degrees up to 5. For example, for degree 2, we have
b ( ; ) = 0 + 1  + 2  + 3 2 + 4  + 5 2 , where  ≡ (0  5 ). We approx
imate conditional expectations with a 10-node Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule. We
57

compute the vector of coeﬃcients  using an LS method based on QR factorization.
To construct an initial EDS grid, we simulate the model under an (arbitrary) initial
guess 0 = 095 + 005 (this guess matches the steady state level of capital equal
to one).
After the solution was computed, we evaluate the quality of the obtained approximations on a stochastic simulation. We generate a new random draw of 10 200
points and discard the first 200 points. At each point (   ), we compute an Eulerequation residual in a unit-free form by using a 10-node Gauss-Hermite quadrature

We restrict our attention to the case in which the countries are characterized
by identical preferences,  = , and identical production technologies,   =  , for
all . The former implies that the planner assigns identical weights,  = 1, and
consequently, identical consumption  =  to all agents. If an interior solution

however, we do not do so. Instead, we compute a separate equilibrium rule for each
country, thus, treating the countries as completely heterogeneous. This approach
allows us to assess the cost of finding solutions in general multidimensional setups in
which countries have heterogeneous preferences and technology.

Equilibrium conditions. Condition (34) in the main text follows from (E17) un
(1 − ) = 1 which ensures that the model admits
der the additional assumption −1
a deterministic steady state (this assumption is commonly used in the related literature; see, e.g., Christiano et al. 2009). Conditions (35)—(40) in the main text
correspond to conditions (E18), (E23), (E33), (E3), (E27) and (E36) in the present
appendix.
Steady state. The steady state is determined by the following system of equations

where ∗ (the target inflation) and  (the steady-state share of government spending
in output) are given.
Calibration procedure. Most of the parameters are calibrated using the estimates of Del Negro et al. (2007, Table 1, column "DSGE posterior"); namely, we
66

assume  = 1 and  = 209 in the utility function (15);  = 007,  = 221, and
 = 082 in the Taylor rule (41);  = 445 in the production function of the finalgood firm (21);  = 083 (the fraction of the intermediate-good firms aﬀected by
price stickiness);  = 023 in the government budget constraint (27); and  = 092,
 = 095,  = 025,   = 054%,   = 038%,   = 1821% (the latter is a
lower estimate of Del Negro et al., 2007, Table 1, column "DSGE posterior"), and
 = 4054% (an average estimate of Del Negro et al., 2007) in the processes for
shocks (17), (28) and (18). From Smets and Wouters (2007), we take the values of
 = 095,  = 022,  = 015,  = 045%,  = 023% and   = 028% in the
processes for shocks (24), (19) and (30). We set the discount factor at  = 099. To
parameterize the Taylor rule (41), we use the steady-state interest rate ∗ = ∗ , and
we consider two alternative values of the target inflation,  ∗ = 1 (a zero net inflation
target) and  ∗ = 10598 (this estimate comes from Del Negro et al., 2007).
Solution procedure. The EDS method for the new Keynesian model is similar
to the one described in Section 4.2 for the neoclassical growth model. We describe
the algorithm below.
To approximate the equilibrium rules, we use the family of ordinary polynomials.
To compute the conditional expectations in the Euler equations (34), (35) and (40),
we use monomial formula 1 with 2 nodes.
We use the first-order perturbation solution delivered by Dynare as an initial guess
(both for the coeﬃcients of the equilibrium rules and for constructing an initial EDS
grid). After the solution on the initial EDS solution is computed, we reconstruct
the EDS grid and repeat the solution procedure (we checked that the subsequent
reconstructions of the EDS grid do not improve the accuracy of solutions).
The simulation length is  = 100 000, and we pick each 10th point so that
 = 10 000. The target number of grid points is  = 1000. In Step 2b, the
damping parameter is set at  = 01, and the convergence parameter is set at
 = 10−7 . We compute residuals on a stochastic simulation of 10 200 observations (we eliminate the first 200 observations). In the test, we use monomial rule
2 with 2 · 62 + 1 nodes which is more accurate than monomial rule 1 used
in the solution procedure. Dynare does not evaluate the accuracy of perturbation
solutions itself. We wrote a MATLAB routine that simulates the perturbation solutions and evaluates their accuracy using the Dynare’s representation of the state
space which includes the current
endogenous state variables {∆−1ª −1 }, the past
