A similar strong association holds for the post-world War II period for a broader cross section of nations. A number of considerations suggest that this association is causal, and that a high rate of machinery investment is a necessary prerequisite for rapid long-run productivity growth - a hypothesis also supported by narratives from the history of technology.\n\n",
