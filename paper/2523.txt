Some Empirical Evidence on the Production Level and Production
Smoothing Models of Inventory Investment

Cost

ABSTRACT

The production smoothing model of inventories has long been the basic paradigm
within which empirical research on inventories has been conducted. The basic hypothesis
embedded in this model is that inventories of finished goods serve primarily to smooth
production levels in the face of fluctuating demand and convex cost functions. However
once we allow for shocks to technology and the costs of producing output firms will also use
inventories to shift production from periods in which production costs are relatively high to
periods in which production costs are relatively low. In this sense inventories can serve to
smooth production costs rather production levels. In this paper we examine the empirical
plausibility of the production level and production cost smoothing models of inventories.
Our basic strategy is to derive and contrast a set of unconditional moment restrictions
implied by these models in a way that minimizes the role of auxiliary assumptions
regarding market structure and industry demand. We find overwhelming evidence against
the productionlevel smoothing model and very little evidence against the production cost
smoothing model. We conclude that the variance of production exceeds the variance of
sales in most manufacturing industries because the production cost smoothing role of
inventories is quantitatively more important than the production level smoothing role of
inventories.

Introduction

The production smoothing model of inventories has long been the basic paradigm
within which empirical research on inventories has been conducted. The basic hypothesis
embedded in this model is
production levels in

that inventories of finished goods serve primarily to smooth

the face of fluctuating demand and convex cost functions, In fact, the

variance of production exceeds the variance of shipments in virtually all manufacturing

industries (see for exampleBlanchard (1983), Blinder (1986a) and West (1986)).
Broadly speaking the responses to this finding fall into one of two categories. First,
a variety of authors have modified the traditional linear quadratic production smoothing
model to allow for an "accelerator" target inventory level, which arises because it is costly
for firms to allow inventories to deviate from some fraction of actual or expected sales (see
for example Blanchard (1983), Eichenbaum (1984) and West (1986) for empirical
formulations of this accelerator inventory target level). Kahn (1987a, 1987b) formally

demonstrates that this accelerator effect can be justified by modeling the stockout
avoidance motive for inventory accumulation. Once this effect is embedded in otherwise
standard production smoothing models there is no a priori reason to expect the variance of
sales to exceed the variance of production.
Second, a variety of authors have sought to modify

the basic production smoothing

models in ways which imply that firms hold inventories primarily to smooth production

than production levels per se. For example Remy (1987), following a
suggestion made in Blinder (1986a), argues that if imperfectly competitive firms operate in
costs rather

a region of declining marginal costs, then cost minimizing firms will choose to make

production more variable than sales.
Other authors like Eichenbaurn (1984), Maccini and Rossana (1984), Blinder
(1986b), Christiano and Eichenbaum (1987), Miron and Zeldes (1987) and West (1987)
retain the assumption of convex cost functions but convert the production level smoothing

model into a productioncost smoothing model by allowing for shocks to technology and the
costs of producing outpot. Here firms use inventories to shift production to periods in
which production costs are relatively low.

In this sense inventories serve to smooth

production costs rather than levels and there is no a priori reason to expect
of production and sales. The relative
unambiguous ordering between the variance
magnitudes

of these two unconditional moments will depend on all of the structural

the preferences underlying
parameters which describe agents' production possibilities,
demand for the goods in question, market structure and the laws of motion for the shocks
to demand and costs.
It is difficult to judge the plausibility of these alternative responses based on the

existing empirical evidence. On the one hand, the evidence presented by

(1987) is obtained from models which are formally over—identified. Unfortunately,
these over—identifying restrictions are tested, they are decisively rejected.

In our view,

these rejections ought to be interpreted with a great deal of caution, at least with respect

to the issue of the importance of technology shocks. The models considered by Blanchard
and Eichenbaum(1987) embed a host of strong

circumstances it is simply very difficult to ascertain which aspects of the models are being
on the importance of

costs shocks per se.

The purpose of this paper is to examinethe empi'rical plausibilityof the production
level and productioncost smoothingmodels of inventories. Our basic strategy is to derive
and contrast a set of unconditional moment restrictions implied by these models in a way

that minimizes the role of auxiliary assumption regarding market structure and industry
2

demand. Consequently we focus our analysis on the necessary conditions for cost
minimization when firms can meet sales, at least in part, out of inventories.
We use art empirical methodology that was suggested by Hansen (1982) and Hansen

and Singleton (1982) who show how to exploit conditional moment restrictions which
emerge from economic theory to estimate and test representative consumer models using
generalized method of moments estimators. As Garber and King (1983) have emphasized,

many applications of this methodology have assumed the absence of shocks to agents'
criterion functions. So for example, in their analyses of the intertemporal capital asset
pricing model, Hansen and Singleton (1982), Dunn and Singleton (1986), Eichenbaum and
Hansen (1988) and Eichenbaum, Hansen and Singleton (1988) do not allow for shocks to
the representative agent's preferences. Under these circumstances the economic theory
being investigated generates relationships between the data and the parameter vector of

interest which would be exact abstracting from the fact that the econometrician does not
directly observe agents' conditional expectations. The only source of error terms in these
econometric analyses is

the difference between agents' conditional expected values of

various functions of observable state variables and their ex post values. When we rule out
shocks

to firms' costs our analysis maps directly into this estimation and testing strategy.

However, when we investigate the production cost smoothing model we must modify

that

strategy to allow for the fact that while agents' observe the shocks to their cost functions,
the econometrician does not. Since the relationships which we investigate are linear in the
state variables, we are able to utilize a strategy discussed in Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld
(1983) and Hansen and Sargent (1982) to overcome the difficulties associated with
unobserved shocks to agents' criterion functions.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follws. In section

2, we describe

the

technology facing firms and then, using this specification, derive relations among
inventories, sales and technology shocks. In section 3, we describe

a strategy for estimating

and testing the two versions of our model. In section 4, we discuss our data and present our

empirical results. Finally, concluding remarks are containedin section

2.

The Model

In this section we accomplish two tasks. First, we display a simple parameterization
of the total cost function faced by firms which embodies both the production level and
production cost smoothing motive for holding inventories. We then derive a first order
condition for cost minimization which must be met in equilibrium.
Since we wish to accommodate two different types of inventory costs that have been
considered in the literature, we assume that total inventory costs, denominated in units of
some numeraire consumption good, are given by

(2.1)

= (b/2)[S — cIJ2 +eiI + (e2/2)I,

the costs of storing inventories of finished goods. The term (b/2)[St —
cI]2 represents the costs associated with allowing inventories to deviate from some fixed
proportion of sales. This "accelerator"term has been used in a variety of empirical analyses
This term reflects

In order to provide a complete solution to this problem we must impose strong
restrictions on the nature of market structure and industry demand (see for example
Eicheribauxn (1983)). Since we seek to minimize the role of auxiliary assumptions in our
empirical analysis we work only with the necessary condition for cost minimization. For

any given sales (and revenue) process, the first order necessary condition for cost
minimization is given by the expectational difference equation:

It depends negatively on the current value of sales. Agaln this captures

the notion that, in the presence of an increasing marginal cost function,firms would rather
meet current sales out of current inventories than increasecurrent output.
Relation (2.8) also implies that desired inventories depend negatively on u, the
time t shock to production costs, This is because firms wish to lower production levels in
periods when marginal production costs are high. In addition

I depends positively on

current and expected future shocks to costs. This motive for inventory accumulation
reflects the fact that firms wish to build up inventories (via production) in periods when
costs are relatively low, and meet future sales out of these stocks of inventories. In this
sense inventories can serve to smooth production costs rather than production levels.

3. Testing the ProductionLevel and ProductionSmoothing Versions of the Model

In this section we accomplish three tasks. First, we derive the set of testable
implications which the model of section 2 imposes when there are no shocks to costs.
Second, we derive the analogous restrictions which

that model imposes when the marginal

costs of production are stochastic. Finally, we show how to simultaneouslyestimate and

test both versions of the model using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
procedure discussed in Hansen (1982) and Hansen and Singleton (1982).
Estimating The ProductionLevel Smoothing Model
When there are no shocks to the marginal cost of production, relation (26) can be
written as,

(31)

Et{(l-AL)(1_AflL)It+i +S1 _(1_bcfa)St//3_eit/afi}= 0.

It is convenient to define the vector valued function

restrictions amount to assuming that the observable state variables in the system inherit

the trend properties of the unobserved exogenous shocks to the system. This type of
assumption has been extensively used in maximum liklihood analyses of linear rational
expectationsmodels (see for example Sargent (1978)). Under this (untestable) assumption,
relation (3.1)' implies that the estimation methodology discussed above can be applied to
detrended (and demeaned) inventory and sales data.

Estimating The Production Cost Smoothing Model
Consider now the situation in which we do not impose the a priori restriction that
the cost function is deterministic. To see the nature of the problem that emerges here
suppose for the moment that the shock to marginal costs,

u, is serially uncorrelated over

time. Then (2.6) can be written as:

Empirical Results

The inventory data are end of month inventoriesof finished goods, adjusted by the

Bureau of Economic Analysis from the book value reported by firms in constant dollars
The data were also adjusted using a procedure suggested by West (1983) which ensures

that inventories and shipments are measured in comparable units. Unfortunately,
seasonally unadjusted data on inventories and sales are not available. Miron and Zeldes
(1987) suggest an approximateprocedure for reinsertingthe seasonal factors back into the

data. They find, however, that their results are quite insensitive to this correction.
Consequently, we proceeded as much of the empirical literature does and used seasonally
adjusted data which were demeaned and detrended using a second order polynomial
function of time..

b and

increasing and the accelerator effect is operative,

Third, the parameter p is estimated quite accurately and indicates substantial serial
correlation in the stochastic component of marginal thsts. Fourth, the parameter A is
estimated quite accurately and for most industries is cnnsistent with the notion that firms
close any gap between actual and target inventories quite quickly. For example when Kiag
equals 3, the estimated values of A imply the values of T5 summarized below:

Chemicals

In all cases the point estimatesindicate that firms

close 95%

of a gap between actual and

target inventories within approximately4 months. Excluding Chemicals and Apparel this
adjustment occurs weU within three months. Overall we conclude, both on the basis of our
formal statistical tests and the behavioral interpretations of the estimated structural

parameters, that there is very little evidence against the production cost smoothing model
of inventories.

We conclude this section by discussing an important caveat concerning our results,
namely

the power of the statistical tests used to asses the empirical plausibility of the
20

production cost smoothing model. As we indicated in

ction 3 the presence of cost shocks

(or for that matter measurement error) imples that ra dom variables which are contained
in agents' time t—-l information set but which are not contained in agents' time
information set cannot be used as instrumentsin testing and estimating the model.

One possible interpretation of our test results is that while the production cost
smoothing is false, our test is simply not sufficiently power to detect this fact. Needless to
say this interpretation of our results cannot be ruled

ot a priori.

Given

a well specified

alternative model of inventory investment it would be possible to investigate the power of
our tests using a variety of Monte Carlo methods. Unfortunatelythere does not seem to be
any well developed alternative model of inventory investment which would violate the

optimality conditions investigated in this paper (at least if we abstract from functional
form considerations). Absent such an alternative, we take our results to be suggestive
rather than definitive.

Conclusion

-

In this paper we investigated the empirical plausibility of the production level and
production cost smoothing models of inventory investme4t. We find overwhelming evidence

against the former model and very little evidence against the latter model, West (1987),
working from an exactly identified model, also finds evidence that cost shocks play at least
as important a role as

demand shocks in determining the time series properties of inventory

investment. In this sense our study is complementary to his. Based on this evidence we
conclude that the variance of production exceeds the variance of sales because one of the
primary functions of inventories is to allow firms to shift production from periods in which
production costs are relativelyhigh to periods in which production costs are relatively low.
As we noted in the introduction,a variety of authors have incorporated cost shocks

into their empiricalanalyses. Yet when those models are tested they are decisively rejected.
The results in this paper suggest that what is being rejected are subsets of the auxiliary
assumptions maintained by those authors, not the basic production cost smoothing model
of inventories. Results in Lichenbaum (1983) and Aiyagari, Eckstein and Eichenbaum
(1988) suggest that the empiricalimplications of a large class of inventory models are not
very sensitive to specification of industry structure. In our view a more promising avenue
for improving the empirical performance of fully specified empirical models of inventory
investment lies in a more careful analysis of industry demand and the impact of
measurement errors.
