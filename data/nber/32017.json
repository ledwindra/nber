    "abstract": "\n\nRecent work shows that popular partially-linear regression specifications can put negative weights on some treatment effects, potentially producing incorrectly-signed estimands. We counter by showing that negative weights are no problem in design-based specifications, in which low-dimensional controls span the conditional expectation of the treatment. Specifically, the estimands of such specifications are convex averages of causal effects with \u201cex-ante\u201d weights that average the potentially negative \u201cex-post\u201d weights across possible treatment realizations. This result extends to design-based instrumental variable estimands under a first-stage monotonicity condition, and applies to \u201cformula\u201d treatments and instruments such as shift-share instruments.\n\n",
