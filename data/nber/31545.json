    "abstract": "\n\nIn theory, unilateral divorce laws alter the private incentive to invest in human capital by permitting either spouse to initiate the division of the marital assets. Using several causal research designs we show that both men and women are less likely to attain a bachelor\u2019s degree in states with unilateral divorce laws\u2014especially individuals who were exposed to the laws when making educational choices and who live in states requiring an even split of assets upon divorce. Unilateral divorce laws do not distort human capital investment generically\u2014but rather in contexts where the property division laws invite moral hazard.\n\n",
