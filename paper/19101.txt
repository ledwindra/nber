The Effect of Medicare Advantage on Hospital Admissions and Mortality

NBER Working Paper No. 19101
June 2013
JEL No. I1,I13,I18
ABSTRACT
Medicare currently allows beneficiaries to choose between a government-run health plan and a privatelyadministered program known as Medicare Advantage (MA). Because enrollment in MA is optional,
conventional observational estimates of the program's impact are potentially subject to selection bias.
To address this, we use a discontinuity in the rules governing MA payments to health plans that gives
greater payments to plans operating in counties in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with populations
of 250,000 or more. The sharp difference in payment rates at this population cutoff creates a greater
incentive for plans to increase the generosity of benefits and therefore enroll more beneficiaries in
MA in counties just above versus just below the cutoff. We find that the expansion of MA on this
margin reduces beneficiaries' rates of hospitalization and mortality.

The welfare implications of public versus private production of publicly-financed
services have been the subject of considerable debate (Shleifer 1998). Proponents of
private production highlight the greater incentives for efficiency and greater ability to
match services to individuals' preferences generally associated with markets. Opponents
emphasize the problems associated with imperfect monitoring and the ability of private
suppliers to avoid unprofitable clients.
This debate has become increasingly relevant as the country struggles to improve
the operation of the Medicare program. Medicare, which provides publicly-financed
health insurance to the elderly and disabled, is the second-largest (after Social Security)
and the fastest-growing piece of the federal budget. This year, Medicare spending will be
3.7% of GDP, which is forecast to rise to 5.2% of GDP by 2027 (Congressional Budget
Office 2012). While the program has been successful in improving the lives of
beneficiaries, it is also widely acknowledged to be highly inefficient, with some
estimating that 20 percent of program spending is of questionable value (Skinner, Fisher,
and Wennberg 2005).
Medicare currently allows beneficiaries to choose between a government-run
health plan known as Traditional Medicare (TM), and privately-administered plans,
known as Medicare Advantage (MA). Enrollment in MA has grown rapidly in recent
years, now accounting for 27 percent of all beneficiaries and 22 percent of program
payments (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012). The opposing views of private versus public
production have been manifested in two distinct policy perspectives on MA. On one
hand, MA plans may be better able to encourage physicians and hospitals to manage care
appropriately, leading to lower costs and/or better health outcomes. On the other hand,
MA plans may reduce welfare, by avoiding enrollment of sicker patients, stinting on care

2

for sicker patients once they are enrolled, or incurring administrative costs that are
disproportionate to their benefits.
Identifying the effects of MA on resource use and quality of care is thus of firstorder importance from the perspective of economics and national fiscal policy. But
because enrollment in MA is optional, conventional observational estimates of the
program's impact are potentially subject to selection bias. To the extent that beneficiaries
who choose MA are unobservably healthier those who choose TM, conventional
estimates of the effect of MA will represent some combination of the program's true
causal effect and unobserved differences in its patient population.
In this paper, we offer a new approach to this problem. We use a discontinuity in
the rules governing MA payments to private health plans that gives greater payments to
plans that cover beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (MSAs) with populations of 250,000 or more. The sharp difference in payment
rates at this population cutoff creates a greater incentive for plans to increase the
generosity of benefits and therefore enroll more beneficiaries in MA in counties just
above versus just below the cutoff. The induced incremental enrollment, in turn, allows
us to identify the effect of MA on the use of medical services and the quality of care for
the incremental enrollees. We find that the expansion of MA on this margin reduces
Medicare beneficiaries' rates of hospitalization and mortality.
The paper proceeds in four parts. Part I provides background on the MA program
and a summary of the vast academic literature on the effects of public versus private
provision of publicly-financed health insurance. Part II describes our experimental
design in detail and the data that we use to investigate the effects of MA relative to TM.
Part III presents our econometric models and results, and Part IV concludes.

I.

Medicare Advantage: Background and Previous Literature
The Medicare program has a long history of private-sector involvement (see

McGuire, Newhouse, and Sinaiko 2011 for an excellent and comprehensive review).
Private insurance plans were introduced to Medicare starting in 1985 with the goals of
expanding beneficiary choice and transferring to the Medicare program some of the
efficiencies thought to have been achieved by managed care plans in the private sector.
Enrollment in private Medicare plans has always been, and still is, optional for
beneficiaries. Those beneficiaries who choose to enroll in a private plan continue to pay
Medicare premiums to the government, equal to about 13 percent of the value of their
benefits (CMS 2011, Table I.1).

In return, they receive their coverage through (and may

pay supplemental premiums to) an MA plan. MA plans receive from Medicare a
predetermined monthly payment, adjusted for the demographic characteristics and health
status of their enrollees.
There is a vast empirical literature that seeks to investigate the relative
performance of MA and TM. This literature has three distinct parts. The best-developed
arm compares the budget cost of MA to that of TM. The finding from this work is clear:
MA spends more than would TM to cover a similar set of beneficiaries (MedPAC
2012a). In 2011, for example, MA spent $1.10 for every dollar that would have been
spent by TM; in 2012, the comparable figure is predicted to be $1.07. This is all the
more striking since the preponderance of evidence suggests that MA enrollees are on
average healthier (MedPAC 2012b).
However, this anomaly is by design. Medicare pays MA plans as a function of a
legislatively-determined rate called the "benchmark," and benchmarks are on average set
well above what it would cost TM to coverage a comparable population. The Affordable

4

Care Act (ACA) reduces MA payments, but they will still be more than TM, likely
because it is immensely popular with beneficiaries: at least some of the extra payments
to plans are passed back in the form of supplemental benefits.
Thus this work leaves two important questions unanswered: notwithstanding
supplemental benefits, does MA consume more or less resources than TM, and is the care
it provides of higher or lower quality? Researchers have sought to address the first of
these questions by comparing rates of use of specific services available in both MA and
TM, controlling for the demographic characteristics and health status of enrollees. This
work generally finds that MA enrollees use fewer services, and experience more
appropriate use, than do their counterparts in TM. For example, Landon et al. (2012) find
that MA enrollees have fewer emergency-room visits, ambulatory surgeries, and inpatient
admissions than comparable TM enrollees. Other work examines rates of readmission to
the hospital (Lemieux et al. 2012, Cohen et al. 2012) and rates of admission for
outpatient-care-sensitive illnesses (Basu and Mobley 2012), and finds them to be lower in
MA as well.
Comparisons of the quality of care in MA versus TM have been more mixed. On
one hand are the studies catalogued above that find lower rates of use of services in MA
typically associated with inferior care (Kruzikas et al. 2000), which points to better
quality of care in MA versus TM. Researchers have also found significantly lower
mortality in MA versus TM (Dowd et al. 2011). On the other hand have been studies
such as Keenan et al. (2009), which show that beneficiaries in MA self-report less
favorable experiences with Medicare than comparable beneficiaries in TM, although
more recent analysis by MedPAC (2012a) suggests that the gap between MA and TM
plans on this dimension is shrinking.

5

Yet, the research design of all of these studies suffers from an important
limitation. They identify the effect of interest by comparing outcomes for beneficiaries
who choose MA rather than TM, controlling for the observable differences between
them. The assumption underlying this strategy -- that enrollees in MA are comparable to
those in TM, conditional on observables -- is potentially problematic. There is evidence
of favorable selection into MA on the basis of observables, and the model used to adjust
payments to MA plans on the basis of observables explains only a fraction of the
variation in beneficiaries' use of services (MedPAC 2012b). Because the unobservable
characteristics of beneficiaries are likely positively correlated with the observables, the
possibility remains that at least part of the estimated cost and quality advantage of MA
over TM is due to unobserved differences in their covered populations rather than the true
causal effects of the programs.
In addition, some related work finds that private health plans in the government's
Medicaid program have been more costly and/or lower quality than their publicly-run
analogue. Private plans were used in the Medicaid program by some states as early as the
1970s, but expanded dramatically after the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997,
which made it possible for states to require certain beneficiaries to enroll in managed care
without obtaining a federal waiver. Two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries now receive
most or all of their benefits through a private plan (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012).
Duggan (2004) finds that the cost but not the quality of care increased in California
counties after versus before they switched most Medicaid beneficiaries to private plans;
Aizer, Currie, and Moretti (2007) use a similar identification strategy and find that the
phase-in of Medicaid managed care reduced the quality of prenatal care and increased the
rates of adverse birth outcomes.

6

Findings from these studies of Medicaid are not necessarily generalizable. First,
the low-income populations that they examine face challenges that the broader elderly
population does not. Second, the data they use comes from California in the 1990s,
which may not reflect the current state of private health plans nationally. Third, in
California, Medicaid fee-for-service reimbursement rates (on which Medicaid managed
care payments are based) are much lower than Medicare rates (Zuckerman, Williams, and
Stockley 2009). Nonetheless, this work provides a cautionary note to the otherwise
generally favorable assessment of MA from the observational analyses.
For these reasons, assessing the performance of MA remains an open empirical
issue. In this paper, we offer a new approach to identifying its effects. We make use of a
discontinuity in the benchmark rate on which Medicare's payments to plans are based. In
the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, Congress established "urban
floors": minimum benchmarks, effective in 2001, for MA plans serving beneficiaries in
counties that were part of MSAs with populations of 250,000 or more in 2000. Plans in
smaller markets were paid lower rates. According to Pope et al. (2006), urban floors had
a major impact on the program, causing plans to expand their benefits and widen their
networks, thereby raising enrollment beyond what it would have otherwise been.
Although the impact of floor rates has been examined in other work, no study to date has
used the urban floor to identify the effect of MA on service use and quality of care.

7

II.

Experiment and data
To understand the nature of our experiment, it is necessary to understand the rules

governing payment to MA plans.1 Plans bid to offer coverage, where the bid is to cover
an average beneficiary. Medicare bases its payment to plans on the relationship between
the bid and the benchmark (payments to plans are also adjusted for their enrollees'
demographics and health). The benchmark is a publicly-disclosed, county-level number
which is a function of several factors, including the county's average historical spending
on TM beneficiaries. If a plan bids above the benchmark, enrollees must pay a premium
equal to the difference between the bid and the benchmark. If a plan bids below the
benchmark, it receives a "rebate" from Medicare equal to 75 percent of the difference,2
which it must pass back to beneficiaries in the form of supplemental benefits or premium
offsets. Thus the existence of an urban floor in the benchmark rate creates a pseudorandom experiment: beneficiaries in counties subject to the urban floor are more likely to
be offered plans with a higher benchmark relative to TM in the area and thus more
generous benefits and/or lower premiums.
We study the utilization of services and quality of care for beneficiaries in the 449
counties that are part of MSAs with populations between 100,000 and 400,000 in 2000.
We compare outcomes from counties in MSAs with populations between 100,000 and
249,999 (not subject to the urban floor) to outcomes from counties in MSAs with
populations between 250,000 and 400,000 (subject to the urban floor).
We use data from several sources. To construct the cohort of beneficiaries that
we examine, we use data from the MedPAR, enrollment, and Part D Plan Characteristics

This paragraph follows closely the explanation in MedPAC (2012c).
The 75 percent rebate which was effective in 2009 (our study period) has been decreased for subsequent
years, and conditioned on plan's measured quality, by the Affordable Care Act.

Files (all files come from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). MedPAR
contains information on the inpatient hospital admissions of every Medicare beneficiary
enrolled in TM, and since 2008, every beneficiary enrolled in MA. We match these data,
at the beneficiary level, with data from the enrollment file, which contains information on
demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and county of residence) and whether the
beneficiary was enrolled in MA or TM. For beneficiaries enrolled in MA, we determine
the type of MA plan in which they enroll with the Part D Plan Characteristics File. With
this information we construct a cohort of elderly beneficiaries (aged 65-99) who were
enrolled in TM for all months of 2009 that they were alive, or enrolled in an HMO, Local
PPO, or Regional PPO MA plan for all months of 2009 that they were alive. We exclude
beneficiaries enrolled in other types of MA plans, in particular Special Needs Plans,
Private Fee For Service Plans, and Employer Plans. These types of plans are
characteristically different from other types of plans, and Special Needs and Employer
Plan enrollees are characteristically different from other enrollees and subject to different
payment rules.
We augment our primary data with information on counties from other sources.
First, we obtained information on the county composition and population of MSAs from
the Census Bureau website.3 Second, we obtained information on the characteristics of
counties from the 2011 Area Resource File and the 2009 American Hospital Association
survey. We did this to investigate the extent to which counties in MSAs above versus
below the urban floor had similar incomes and numbers of physicians and specialists.
Third, we constructed zip-code level measures of hospital market competitiveness
(measured by a Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI)) and the density of hospital market

characteristics (for-profit/non-profit/public, teaching, system, and hospital-size status)
using 2008 Medicare data according to the method in Kessler and McClellan (2000).
Fourth, we obtained information from the CMS website on the composition of MA
enrollment by plan type,4 the average risk score of MA enrollees,5 and the average risk
score of TM enrollees6 to investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in counties above
versus below the urban floor had similar health status. We match either the MA average
risk score or the TM average risk score to each beneficiary based on his Medicare
enrollment status.
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations of our outcome and control
variables for all non-rural Medicare beneficiaries and beneficiaries from MSAs with
population 100,000 - 400,000. For beneficiaries from MSAs in this population range, it
also presents descriptive statistics by county floor status (in MSAs with above versus
below 250,000 population), along with p-values from difference-in-means hypothesis
tests (based on heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors clustered at the county level).
The first row of the table shows that floor status affects incentives and MA enrollment in
the way that a simple model would predict. Beneficiaries from counties above the urban
floor threshold have a significantly higher benchmark payment rate ($832) than do
beneficiaries from counties below the threshold ($784), or about 6 percent. It is also true
that beneficiaries from above-threshold counties are significantly more likely to enroll in
MA -- 11.3 percentage points as compared to 6.1 percentage points, p < 0.001.

The next panel of the table presents average outcomes by floor status, and
previews our analysis. On average, 16.8 percent of non-rural beneficiaries are admitted
to the hospital at least once; the admission rate in our sample is slightly higher at 16.9
percent. This aggregate rate, however, masks an important difference in counties above
versus below the floor threshold. Beneficiaries from above-threshold counties have an
admission rate of 16.4 percentage points, whereas those from below-threshold counties
have a rate of 17.3 percentage points. This difference of 0.9 percentage points, or
approximately 5 percent, is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The rate of
admissions for conditions thought to be sensitive to appropriate outpatient care (referred
to in the literature as ambulatory-care-sensitive (ACS) (Nicholas 2011) or preventable
(Basu and Mobley 2012) admissions) is also statistically significantly lower in abovethreshold counties; although the difference is smaller in magnitude, it is proportionately
almost twice as large. Mortality in the two groups is not statistically distinguishable at
conventional levels.
If the above-threshold and below-threshold counties were otherwise similar, these
results would imply that expansion of MA along the margin we examine leads to fewer
hospitalizations but better (or at least no worse) health outcomes. In terms of most
(although not all) important covariates, above- and below-threshold counties are not
statistically distinguishable. The CMS risk scores for the two groups -- Medicare's best
guess as to the groups' expected medical spending -- are virtually identical (0.975 versus
0.977). T-tests fail to reject no difference in the age, gender, racial, and regional profiles
of the two groups as well. There are some notable differences in the two types of
counties. Most striking, of course, is the difference in their size. The average beneficiary
in a below-threshold county lives in a significantly smaller MSA than one in an above-

11

threshold county. This is relevant because other work shows that small urban areas had
fewer MA options than large areas even before urban floors were established (Pope et al.
2006, Table 3-4). There are other relevant differences between the groups, also likely
related to size. Above-threshold counties have higher (beneficiary-weighted) Medicare
enrollment and median income ($47,300 versus $44,500, p = 0.023), although their
poverty rates are not statistically distinguishable at conventional levels. Their residents
are also more likely to be admitted to larger hospitals (100-299 and 300+ beds, versus
<100 beds). The extent to which these factors explain differences in MA enrollment or
outcomes is an important question to which we now turn.

III.

Econometric models and results
Our models specify the hospitalization or mortality during 2009 of beneficiary i =

1, ..., Nzc in zip code z = 1,..., Z that lies in county c = 1,..., C, Yizc, as a function of MA
enrollment status, health and demographic characteristics, and zip-code and county
characteristics:
Yizc = α + βMAizc + Xizcγ + Hczδ + Wcη + uizc ,

(1)

where
Yizc

is an indicator = 1 if the beneficiary had a hospital admission, an ACS admission,
or death in 2009;

MAizc is an indicator = 1 if the beneficiary was enrolled in MA for all of 2009;
Xizc

is the CMS risk score and indicator variables for the age (70-74, 75-79, 80-89, 9099, omitted group is 65-69) gender, and race of the beneficiary;

Hzc

represents zip-code level hospital market characteristics, including the HHI, a
hospital capacity index, and the density of for-profit, non-profit (omitted group is

12

public), teaching, system, 100-299 bed and 300+ bed (omitted group is <100 bed)
hospitals;
Wc

contains the county's number of Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 (and its square
and cube), its 2009 median income and other county-level characteristics in 2009,
and its MSA's population in 2000 (on which its floor status is based, and its
square and cube); and

uizc

is an error term that we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each county.
OLS estimates from this model identify the effect of MA on Yizc only under the

assumption that MA enrollment decisions are uncorrelated with uizc , which is likely to be
incorrect. For this reason we specify the MA enrollment decision as a logit model of Xizc,
Hzc, Wc, and Zc , where Zc is an indicator = 1 if county c is in an MSA with population of
250,000 or more:
Pr( MAizc  1) 

exp(  X izc  H zc  Wc   Z c   izc )
,
1  exp(  X izc  H zc  Wc   Z c  izc )

(2)

and vizc is an error term that we allow to be arbitrarily correlated within each county.
We follow Wooldridge (2010, section 21.4.1.) and estimate (1) by instrumental variables,
using as instruments Xizc, Hzc, Wc, and MAhatizc , where MAhatizc are the predicted values
from (2). We also present OLS estimates of (1) for comparison.
Finally, we estimate placebo models in order to investigate the validity of the
assumptions underlying our IV strategy. We present OLS and IV estimates of (1) and (2)
using DIED2000izc and MA2000izc, respectively, as dependent variables. DIED2000izc is
defined for the cohort of beneficiaries enrolled in either MA or FFS Medicare for all 12
months in the year 2000, DIED2000izc = 1 if beneficiary i died in 2000, 0 otherwise;

13

MA2000izc = 1 if beneficiary i was enrolled in MA for all 12 months of 2000.7 Because
the urban payment floor did not take effect until 2001, in the absence of unobserved
differences in beneficiary health or the medical care environment between above- versus
below-threshold counties, there should be no effect of floor status on MA enrollment, and
in turn no negative IV effect of MA on DIED2000izc.
Table 2 presents estimated marginal effects from (2), the logit of MA enrollment
on Xizc, Hzc, Wc, and Zc . For ease of interpretation, all effects in this and subsequent
tables are measured in percentage points, i.e., on a scale from 0 to 100. The table reports
heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allowing for arbitrary clustering within
counties. The first row of the table shows that counties above the 250,000 population
threshold have significantly greater MA enrollment, with a marginal effect evaluated at
the mean of the other variables of 4.7 percentage points. The effect of the other
covariates is consistent with previous research. High-risk and older beneficiaries are
significantly less likely to enroll in MA; female, black, and beneficiaries from poorer
MSAs are significantly more likely to enroll. With these estimates, we construct a
predicted probability of enrollment in MA for each beneficiary which we use as an
instrument to estimate equation (1).
Table 3 presents selected OLS and IV estimates from equation (2), the effect of
MA on hospital admissions, ACS admissions, and mortality.8 MA enrollment reduces
the rate of admission to the hospital in general and for ACS conditions. According to the
IV estimates in column (2), MA reduces the probability of admission by 3.4 percentage

7

The variables Xizc, Wc, and Zc are defined as above, except a) they are based on 2000 data and b) exclude
the CMS risk score, which did not exist and cannot be calculated for 2000. We substitute conventional
county-level measures of hospital market competitiveness and other market characteristics (Hc) based on
hospital bed shares from the year 2000 because we did not have sufficient information to calculate Hzc.
8
We report estimates for covariates that differed significantly above versus below the floor threshold.

14

points (standard error 1 percentage point). On a base admission rate of 16.9 percentage
points (table 1), this amounts to a 22 percent reduction. Part of the effect of MA on
admissions arises out of its impact on ACS conditions; MA reduces the probability of an
ACS admission by 0.69 percentage points (standard error 0.38 percentage points,
significant at the 10 percent level). There is also a significant IV effect of MA on
mortality of 0.7 percentage points (column (6), standard error 0.19 percentage points); on
a base of 4.6 percentage points, this amounts to a 15 percent reduction. Although the IV
estimates are smaller than the OLS estimates, they are not statistically distinguishable
from them at conventional levels, based on the IV standard errors. Of the other
covariates, only the CMS risk score has a uniformly significant effect, suggesting that
most of the impact of differences in the other covariates in above- versus below-threshold
counties are accounted for by the polynominals in area size.
Table 4 presents results from placebo models of (1) and (2). They show results
from models of the probability of enrollment in MA in the year 2000, and the OLS and
IV effects of MA on mortality in 2000, using as an instrument the predicted probability of
enrollment based on what the floor status of each year-2000 beneficiary's county would
have been, had the urban floor then been in effect. These estimates have no causal
interpretation, since the instrument on which they are based is by definition invalid.
Instead, they are intended as a diagnostic test for the presence of unobserved differences
in the probability of MA enrollment and beneficiary health in the year 2000 between
above- and below-threshold counties. None of the year 2000 models include controls for
the CMS risk score, since risk adjustment did not begin until 2004.
These tests suggest that the instrument is picking up the incentive effects of the
benchmark on enrollment and is otherwise uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of

15

health. According to column (1), there is no significant or economically important effect
on MA enrollment of residing in an above-threshold county in the year 2000, before the
payment change was implemented. The positive coefficient on MA in column (3) is
inconsistent with the hypothesis that beneficiaries in above-threshold counties had better
health in 2000; if anything, it suggests that the opposite is true. To the extent that arealevel differences in health are time-invariant, this finding suggests that our IV strategy
understates (in absolute value) the true effect of MA.
We also reestimated the IV models underlying Table 3 excluding the risk score to
investigate whether our estimated effects might be due to endogeneity in the score's
determination. If MA plans encourage more intensive coding, and more intensive coding
leads to higher risk scores, estimates of the effect of MA conditional on risk score would
be inconsistent. The inconsistency arises because of positive correlation between
measurement error in the risk score and the instrument; overstated risk scores for MA
beneficiaries would make MA appear to have a greater beneficial effect on health than it
actually did. However, we found no evidence to support this hypothesis. IV estimates
of the models underlying Table 3 excluding the risk score were of approximately the
same magnitude, although their standard errors were larger, reflecting the larger variance
of the residual in equation (1).

IV.

Conclusion
Medicare currently allows beneficiaries to choose between a government-run

health plan known as Traditional Medicare (TM), and privately-administered plans,
known as Medicare Advantage (MA). Assessing the relative performance of TM and
MA is an important issue, with first-order implications for not only national health and

16

fiscal policy but also economic theory. However, because enrollment in MA is optional,
evaluating the MA program is difficult. Beneficiaries who choose MA are observably
healthier than those who choose TM. Because observational data on health is notoriously
incomplete, and unobservable differences are likely positively correlated with
observables, conventional analysis of MA's impact are potentially subject to selection
bias -- bias that would tend to make MA look more efficient than it actually is.
In this paper, we offer a new approach to identifying the effects of MA. We use a
discontinuity in the rules governing MA payments to private health plans that gives
greater payments to plans that cover beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations of 250,000 or more. The sharp
difference in payment rates at this population cutoff creates a greater incentive for plans
to enroll beneficiaries in MA in counties just above versus just below the cutoff. The
induced incremental enrollment, in turn, allows us to identify the effect of MA on the use
of health services and the quality of care.
We find that the higher payment rate in these "urban floor" counties leads to
significantly higher MA enrollment. In turn, payment-induced MA enrollment leads to
statistically significantly lower rates of hospitalization and lower mortality. These
findings support the hypothesis that MA provides better care than TM.
Our findings are consistent with recent regression-based estimates of the effect of
MA. Landon et al. (2012), for example, find significantly fewer admissions per
beneficiary in MA versus TM in 2009 using a matching algorithm; although our IV
estimates are larger than their estimates, they are not statistically distinguishable. Dowd
et al. (2011) find lower mortality in MA plans in the 1990s, although their selectioncorrected estimates show a much larger effect on mortality than do ours.

17

Because our identification strategy depends crucially on the assumption that
county floor status is uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of service use and
health, we conducted placebo tests to investigate its validity as an IV. We estimated the
effect of county floor status on MA enrollment, and the effect MA on mortality, in the
year 2000. In the absence of correlation between the instrument and unobservables, there
should be no effect of MA: the payment increases due to the floor didn't take effect until
2001. We found no evidence that beneficiaries from counties that later had
discontinuously higher payment rates were more likely to enroll in MA, healthier, or less
likely to need hospital care -- if anything, the opposite appears to be true.
Although we find that MA leads to fewer hospitalizations and less mortality, we
cannot say that MA is more efficient than TM. Because the incremental MA enrollment
underlying our estimates is induced by higher payment rates, we cannot determine
whether the superior care received by MA enrollees is due to better management by
private health plans or to the additional services provided to beneficiaries as a result of
the higher rates. Indeed, other work has found increasing payment to MA plans reduces
the rate at which their beneficiaries are hospitalized for certain conditions, which
suggests that the latter mechanism may be relevant (Nicholas 2011). By implication, we
cannot say whether MA plans would provide better care than TM, were they to be paid
less than they were in 2009. This limitation of our study design is important. The ACA
significantly reduces payments to MA plans in the future, especially those in areas with
benchmarks that are above TM spending levels -- which is obviously related to county
floor status. For this reason, our findings cannot be directly extrapolated to the future
performance of MA.

18

However, our estimates can be used as a starting point to bound MA's efficiency
gains and inform current policy. To determine whether MA is more efficient than TM
from a social perspective requires a comparison of the marginal expenditure/benefit ratios
in the two programs. To derive this from our estimates for MA, the key question is the
share of floor-induced increases in the benchmark that represent real resources consumed
by health plans or beneficiaries, in the form of MA plan management expenses or
additional services that contribute to health, versus the share that are transfers, in the form
of funds returned to Medicare (i.e., the 25% of the difference between the bid and the
benchmark), gains to plans' shareholders, lower MA premiums or cost sharing for
beneficiaries, broader MA provider networks, or services like vision coverage (which,
although they may provide utility, do not directly reduce mortality or otherwise improve
conventional measures of health outcomes). If we assume that all of the $48/month
increase in the benchmark (the difference between the benchmark in above- versus
below-threshold counties, table 1) due to the floor represents real resource use, and the
only relevant measure of benefit is avoided mortality, then the MA expansion we
examine would be efficient as long as TM's marginal expenditure/benefit ratio were
greater than approximately $165,000 per year of life saved, since MA spent $576 (=
$48*12) per year to get approximately 3.5 fewer deaths per thousand beneficiary-years (=
0.0070 calendar-year mortality reduction from table 3 / 2).
For several reasons, this understates the cost-effectiveness of MA. First, it
attributes no direct benefit to patients from the decrease in hospitalizations we observe,
over and above any effect on mortality. Second, it assumes that no mortality benefits
persist beyond 6 months on average. Third, it assumes none of the increase in the
benchmark is returned to Medicare, and none represents a transfer to beneficiaries or

19

plans. Nonetheless, the underlying calculations illustrate the sort of information that
would be necessary in order to assess more precisely the benefits of expanding MA.
For purposes of policy, the key question is how much of the gains from MA that
we observe could be achieved in the absence of increased government outlays in the form
of the higher benchmark. This is related (although not identical) to the question above.
To the extent that spending increases attributable to the urban floor represent transfers,
the gains from expanding MA could be achieved without them, at least in theory. If all of
the increases were transfers, none would be necessary to obtain the quality improvements
that we found, as long as beneficiaries could be otherwise induced into the program by
(for example) making TM less attractive.
Future research, along the lines of Song, Landrum, and Chernew (2012), might
seek to estimate or simulate the value of these parameters. Future work should also seek
to evaluate the performance of MA in the post-ACA world, where payments to MA plans
will be less generous on average than they were historically, and the performance of MA
under competitive bidding. Finally, future research might seek to investigate how MA
interacts with the competitiveness of hospital, physician, and insurance markets, to
determine the circumstances under which the gains from MA that we find would be most
likely to be achievable.
