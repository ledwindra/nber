    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores the interface between personality psychology and economics.  We examine the predictive power of personality and the stability of personality traits over the life cycle.  We develop simple analytical frameworks for interpreting the evidence in personality psychology and suggest promising avenues for future research.\n\n",
