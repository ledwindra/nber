Global Real Estate Markets — Cycles and Fundamentals
Bradford Case, William Goetzmann, and K. Geert Rouwenhorst

NBER Working Paper No. 7566
February 2000

ABSTRACT
The correlations among international real estate markets are surprisingly high, given the
degree to which they are segmented. While industrial, office and retail properties exist all around the

world, they are not economic substitutes because of locational specificity. In addition, the broad

securitization of real estate property companies has, until recently, lagged that of other types of
companies. Never-the-less, international property returns move together in dramatic fashion. In this

paper, we use eleven years of global property returns to explore the factors influencing this comovement. We attribute a substantial amount of the correlation across world property markets to
the effects of changes in GNP, suggesting that real estate is a bet on fundamental economic variables

which are correlated across countries. A decomposition shows that a local production factor is more

important in some countries than in others.

I. Introduction
The real estate business is distinguished from almost all others by the fact that its "product"
is not portable. For the most part, property owners compete locally for business. While inter-urban

competition for industrial, office or retail space exists, customer choice depends upon a number of
economic factors beyond the price and quality of the space. Thus, one would expect the correlation

of changes in property values across markets to diminish with the distance between them. There
are no short-term arbitrage forces preventing prices in one local market from suddenly getting hot
while prices in another local market are dropping--buildings from one market cannot be moved to

the other. For the same reasons, one might also expect international property markets to exhibit
low correlations due to the difficulties of re-locating businesses across national boundaries. Studies

measuring the diversification benefits of real estate and other asset classes suggest real estate
compares favorably in this dimension (e.g. Eicholtz. 1996. Eicholtz and Hartzell, 1996. Eicholtz et.

Al, 1998, Liu and Mci, 1998, Liu, Hartzell and Hoeseli, 1997). After looking at recent published

empirical evidence, it is clear that international real estate investment is useful for portfolio
diversification.

This logic makes the evidence about co-movement in intemational property returns all the
more striking. Goetzmann and Wachter (1996) [OW] document that the real estate crash in the early
1990's was feitby nearly every country in the world. Despite their separation by political boundaries

and great distances, the world's office markets plunged into a slump together. While economists
looked for local reasons for local decreases in property values, the reality is that there were no safe

havens for property investors in the years 1991 and 1992. Diversification did not help. The
conjecture in GW was that this slump was due to exposures to global GDP. Unfortunately,
2

insufficient time-series data prevented any formal test of the conjecture. Work by Quan and Titman

(1998), using the same data sources as GW and longer time series document that real estate is
significantly correlated to stock returns and to changes in GDP. In his in-depth analysis of the
international real estate slump of the 1990's, Renaud (1997) considers the degree to which unique
events in the late 1980's may have led to the correlated change in real estate prices and the global
economy. He also discusses the co-cyclycality of global economies and real estate. Together, these

recent studies suggest that a mix of global and local economic factors influence the world's real
estate markets.

In this paper, we use 11 years of commercial property data to examine the relationship
between GNP changes property returns. We explore the relationship in considerably more depth
than OW and take a different approach to GDP effects than Quan and Titman. Our goal is to separate

global from local economic effects on the covariance of real estate returns. In particular, we test to

see whether the correlations across global real estate markets are due to common exposures to

changes in world GDP. In addition, we estimate the incremental value of local economic
fluctuations in explaining real estate performance. We find strong evidence to show that removing
the effects of both country-specific GDP and global GDP from returns significantly decreases global

real estate market correlations. Of the two, global GDP has the greatest effect.

The implications of our results are twofold. First, world real estate markets are largely
correlated through common GDP effects. Thus, we find that even markets that are segmented by

definition can exhibit significant correlations if they are exposed to a common source of risk.
Second, we show that an investment in a global real estate portfolio is essentially a bet on broad
trends in global production.

II. Data
International property return data is difficult to obtain. Some authors have collected returns

from publically traded property companies in a number of countries for successful analysis. This

is useful but not always representative of the markets in all countries, and depends upon the
existence of public markets in property companies. Our data source is a recently dissolved global

consortium of real estate firms that collectively shared yield and effective rent data sampled and

assembled on an annual basis. Until recently, these firms were affiliated through International
Commercial Property Associates (ICPA), with a successor agreement with ONCOR International.

Over the past decade, their estimates of yields and effective rents were formed by firms operating
in each market according to commonly agreed upon standards. These estimates were published as
ICPA's "International Property Bulletin" and ONCOR's "World Real Estate Review," and "European

Property Bulletin." Both ICPA and ONCOR have ceased publishing these data, but London-based

Hillier Parker has continued to organize European firms to share data for European markets. In
addition, the data for Asian real estate markets is also collected by several affiliates of Hillier Parker
and published by its Hong Kong affiliate. Brooke Hillier Parker, in "Asian Property Market Survey."

Throughout the time ICPA existed, new markets entered --particularly emerging markets in Asia.
The existence of these markets in the database is undoubtably conditioned upon investor interest,

and thus potentially biased by positive performance. Thus, some of the markets included in our
database may have been "backfilled" and the paucity of data about other markets, particularly the

lack of industrial and retail information about Japan, for example, may result from recent lack of
interest in international investing there.

Since we do not have income and capital appreciation returns reported as such in the
4

database, we estimate them using yields and cap-rates. Specifically, total returns (income and
appreciation) for prime industrial, office, and retail real estate in 22 cities around the world is the

sum of the estimated yield and the change in capitalized estimated effective rents:
=

equals

+ _______ - I

where T1, equals estimated total return for city i at time I; i,r

the estimated yields (going-in cap rates); and R1 equals estimated effective rents. This

implicitly assum.es that the perpetuity formula is a reasonable approximation to value. Rents and
yields were estimated for consistently-defined standard properties in the prime commercial districts

of each city by commercial real estate firms in each country.
While these sources present data for a large number of cities, the analysis must be restricted
to those markets for which estimated rents and yields are available for every year during the period

1987-1997. Table 1 shows the 22 markets from 21 countries included in the analysis under this
criterion. Two German markets, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt, are inc]uded. because the required data
were available for both cities.
While the effective rent data are given in nominal terms and generally denominated in local

currency, from the perspective of a U.S. investor it is more relevant to consider returns expressed
in U.S. dollars. Therefore the nominal foreign-currency returns were converted to real U.S. dollar

terms by using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each year and then deflating by the U.S.
inflation rate.

Table I shows the geometric means, arithmetic means, and standard deviations of the total

5

return series computed for each type of real estate, and for the stock market total return series. The
average total returns are in some cases spectacu]arly high: for example, the geometric means for the

11-year period exceed 20 percent for industrial space and office space in Hong Kong, Portugal,

Singapore, and Thailand and for retail space in Portugal and Thailand. At the same time, these
investments were extremely volatile, with standard deviations exceeding 40 percent in several cases.

The volatility for the U.S. is only slightly higher than obtained from other appraisal-based indices.

As a check on whether the yield-based return series' for the U.S. correspond to appraisalbased returns in the U.S. we measured the correlation to the NCREIIF index . The U.S. Industrial
property index had a correlation of .84 to the NCREIF index and the U.S. Office property index had

a correlation of .56. Neither had a significant correlation to the NARE1T index of equity real estate

investment trusts. Thus, we are using series' that more closely resemble and indeed track the
appraisal-based indices commonly used in the U.S to measure commercial real estate performance.

Figure 1 shows the trend in real estate returns over the period 1987 through 1997 for each
country and property type. The crash of the early 1991 through 1993 shows up clearly as a majority
of markets and property types experiences negative real returns during the period. There were almost

no safe havens during this period. Only Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Portugal had strong
positive returns in the three-year slump. The year 1997 closely resembles the early 90's, when most

real returns were negative. The comovement between markets also shows up in the correlations.
We do not report the entire 60 by 60 correlation matrix, however, on average, the correlations within

property types across countries ranged between 0.33 and 0.44.

Figure 2 shows the dollar-denominated changes in GDP for each country, deflated by the
U.S. CPI over the same time period. The eleven-year period contains two booms and two busts in
6

the global economy. The relationship to the real estate cycles is unmistakable --property returns
clearly fluctuate with GDP changes. In the next section we more formally test the effects of GDP on

real estate market trends and correlations.

ifi. Methodology
In this section we test the hypothesis that international real estate markets are correlated
through GDP. To do this, we first remove the effects of a country's own GDP on its property return

series through univariate linear regression of the return series on contemporaneous GDP changes.

Then for each property type, we compare the correlation matrices of the raw returns and of the
regression residuals. Finally, we perform a paired t-test of the off-diagonal elements in the return
and residual correlation matrixes to determine whether the difference in the means is significant.
Rejecting the null hypothesis of equality of returns and residual correlations would provide strong
support for the hypothesis that the co-movement of global real estate markets is driven by common

exposure to factors affecting production. We then perform the same test after removing the effects

of an equal-weighted index of GDP changes. This second test allows us to examine whether
exposure the global economy explains correlations. In the second test, we expect the average
correlation to decrease, since we are simply extracting a common factor. This is not necessarily the

true when we extract each country's own GDP effect, however. If local GDP effects are important
and uncorrelated across countries, then removing them could increase correlations of the residuals.

If the local the GDP factor reflected both important local economic effects and globa' economic
effects, then correlations could either increase or decrease.

7

III.] T-test results
Table II reports the results of the paired t-test for each property-type in the sample. The
correlation of dollar-denominated returns is relatively high for each property-type, although highest

for office properties. It is tempting to attribute this high correlation to the fact that customers for
class A office space in major countries around the world have increasingly become the same 100
multi-national firms, however we no empirical evidence to support this conjecture. The table shows

that purging the returns of the effects of own-country GDP changes results in a significant drop in

average correlation across country. The largest proportional drop was in the Industrial property
sector -- the sector most closely tied with production -- which dropped to a third of it value. Notice

that purging the returns of the equal-weighted GDP factor results in an even larger and strongly
significant decrease in average correlation across countries. In fact, the average correlation in the
Industrial property sector drops to 0.087.
Another way to evaluate the effects of removing local GDP and global GDP is to examine
the change in summed variance. Removing the global factor decreases variance by 58 to 72 percent.

Removing only the local factor results in 20 to 30 percent variance reduction.

1112 Global vs. Local Effects

The analysis thus far shows that the effect on covariance of removing an equal-weighted
global GDP factor is, on average, important. Cross-sectional differences may be relevant, however.

For example, the recent performance of Asian real estate markets suggests that local GDP factors
may overwhelm global trends.

Th order to compare the relative effects of global vs. local GDP

effect, we use econometric methods to separate the two. In Table ifi we report the R2 from
8

regressions in which we separate the GDP factor into local and common components. To do this,
we first regress each GDP series on the equal-weighted global GDP factor and save the residuals.
Next, we use these residuals in a regression, together with the equal-weighted global GDP factor as

variables to explain each real estate market. I.e. in stage 1, we estimate the local GDP factor X1

with the regression: G1, = a+

J67, + ),

where G1 is the change in GDP for country i at time

and G is the equal-weighted global GDP factor realization at time t. Tn stage 2, we use X1 and G
as regressors to explain the total return series for a real estate market: 77, = a+flG + 44, + ç and

save the R2 from this regression as RA2. Finally, we use only G as an explanatory
variable: 77,

= a+

+

and save the R2 from this regression as RB2.

In order to determine the importance of the local GDP component to the global GDP

component, we take the difference in R2 and divide by the R2 from the regression on the global factor

alone. That is: (RA2 -R2)/R2. It is important to note that the number of time-series observations
in each regression is only eleven. Thus, we would expect relatively high R2 from a regression with
two explanatory variables. We have not used adjusted-R2, although this would be appropriate if we

were explicitly testing an hypothesis with this ratio. With these caveats in mind, we use the ratio
on]y for the purposes of indicating the tendency in each market for the local factor to predominate
over the global factor. In fact for most markets, the g]obal factor is most important-- the incremental

variance explained by the local residual variable is less that the amount of variance explained by the

global factor. There are a few markets that differ from this norm, however. We find that Australia,
Canada, Hong Kong, Thailand, U.K. and to some extent, the U.S., Malaysia and Spain are countries
where local GDP effects dominate global influences. We might expect this for the U.S. and the U.K.
9

since the GDP factor is equal-weighted and these two countries' GDP's would obviously have a
larger than equal weight were we using gross GDP weights, or market capitalization weights. This

is not true for some of the other countries, however. The table suggests that, while fundamental
economic factors explain much of the performance of local real estate markets, the effects of local
economic deviations from global trends are more important for some countries, the U.S. included.

111.3 Time-series regressions

Although we have only eleven years of data, it is useful to further consider how the global
GDP factor is r&ated to the fluctuations of property returns. In Table ifi weregress equal-weighted

portfolios of property-types on the equal-weighted GDP factor, and include the one-year lagged

values of GDP changes and the lagged property-type return itself, in order to control for
autocorrelation in the regression error. Note that in each case, the contemporaneous GDP change
is significantly related to returns, and the lagged value is not. In this regard, our time-series results

are broadly consistent with Quan and Titman (1998). This is potentially important, because one
criticism of all appraisal-related real estate data is that itcaptures "asking rents" not "effective rents."

Asking rents are typically sticky and thus area stale measure of real estate markets. The lack of a
lagged relationship between GDP and real estate returns suggests that contemporaneous economic
conditions are reflected in our data. This does not mean our return series' are unpredictable random

walks. lii two of the three regressions, office and retail, the lagged value of the return series is also
significant, indicating strong persistence.

10

1114 US. Time-Series Regression

Although long-term international data is unavailable, we have time-series data for the U.S.

commercial property market that extends from 1960. We use Ibbotson Associates Business Real

Estate total annual return series from 1960 through 1994, and the NCREIF index for years 1995
through 1997. This is the dependent variable in a regression that includes four years of lagged values

and contemporaneous and four lagged values of U.S. GDP growth. The results of this regression are

reported in Table 4.

Contemporaneous GDP growth has a coefficient of .65 and is strongly

significant. The inclusion of four lags for each series appears to eliminate the autocorrelation of the
errors in the regression -- the Durbin-Watson statistic is 2. This regression indicates that in at least

one market where we do have long-term data, the relation between GDP growth and real estate
returns is a strong one.

IV. Diversification

The co-movement of real estate markets through exposure to global GDP changes is
potentially meaningful to investors because it suggests that despite the obvious importance of local
economic conditions to the determinants of property values, diversification has its limits. One way

to explore these limits is to consider how the volatility of a real estate portfolio decreases as more

markets are added to the portfolio. Figure 3 shows the average percentage reduction in volatility
achieved by adding additional countries in sequence, by property type. Country stock markets are

provided for a comparison. The greatest percentage reduction in risk through international
diversification is achieved by the industrial property type and the least percentage of reduction in risk

through international diversification is achieved by office markets. Both office markets and retail

11

markets appear to offer slightly lower relative benefits to international diversification than do equity
markets. In general, however the figure suggests that the international diversification benefits to real

estate are similar in magnitude to those of the equity markets. This is somewhat surprising in light
of the fundamentally location-specific nature of real estate as an investment.
Figure 4 shows the result of removing the global GDP factor from each series. In effect, the

figure shows the results of a portfolio continuously hedged against GDP risk. Notice that the risk

of the industrial portfolio drops considerably, and is well below the equity portfolio limit. The
lower bound is at 13.7 % of the variance of a portfolio with a single country industrial real estate
portfolio investment.

V Conclusions
Our analysis of the re]ationship between changes in GDP and international property returns

suggests that the cross-border correlations of real estate are due in part to common exposure to
fluctuations in the global economy, as measured by an equal-weighted index of international GDP

changes. Country-specific GDP changes help explain more of the variation in real estate returns.

Indeed, in some countries local factors explain considerably more, in percentage terms, than do
global factors. Our study suggests that, while real estate is fundamentally local, demand for space

apparently responds to contemporaneous changes in the global economy. Our analysis of
international diversification suggests that portfolio volatility is reduced by cross-border property
investment, but that only one asset class, Industrial properties, actually yields greater diversification

benefits than international equity market diversification.

This table reports the results of testing the hypothesis that the average off-diagonal elementin the correlation
matrix of property-type returns across countries in the sample is equal to the average off-diagonal element
in the correlation matrix of residuals that result from the return series being regressed on its own change in
GDP. All returns and residuals and GDP changes are real U.S. dollar denominated. Please note, [-statistics
have not been corrected for doubled off-diagonal values in the correlation matrices.

from (1) regressions of returns on the equalweighted g'obal CDP factor and the orthogonal local GDP factor for each market and (2) regressions
of returnson theequal-weightedglobal GDPfactoralone. Theorthogonallocal CDPfactorisconstructedby regressingeach country's
change in ODP
on the equal-weightedglobal GDP factor, which is constructed as an equal-weighted portfolio of each country's change in GDP. The ratio is the
difference in R2 between the two regressions, scaled by the R2 of the regression on the global GDP factor alone. Ratios for countries where the
incremental R2 due to local GDP changes exceeds R2 due to the global GDP factor are in hold. 1(2 are unadjusted.
