    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper presents the first systematic estimates of the direct money costs of reproduction-related health services. In 1982 Americans spent approximately $17.7 billion for contraception, abortion, treatment of infertility, obstetrical care, and infant care. This represented 5.5 percent of total health care spending and was equal to $327 per woman of reproductive age (15?44). Obstetrical care accounted for almost half of the reproduction-related expenditures and infant care accounted for morethan one-third. The paper discusses the demographic, technologic, economic,and sociopolitical factors that determine these expenditures. It also considers related public policy issues regarding legal status, sources of funding, and allocation of resources.\n\n",
