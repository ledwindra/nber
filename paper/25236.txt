ABSTRACT
We compare patterns of unemployment and joblessness between Canada and the U.S. during the
Great Recession. Similar to previous findings for the U.S. in Kroft et al. [2016], we document a
rise in long-term unemployment in Canada. This increase is not accounted for by changes in the
observable composition of the unemployed. We then extend the matching model in Kroft et al.
[2016] to exploit the restricted-access panel data from the Canadian Labor Force Survey which
contains information on the time since the last job (“joblessness duration”) for both unemployed
individuals and non-participants. This allows us to model duration dependence in all labor force
flows involving either unemployment or non-participation. To calibrate the extended matching
model, we create a new historical vacancy series for Canada based on relative employment in
“recruiting industries”, allowing us to construct a monthly Beveridge curve for Canada. We find
that the calibrated model matches the time series of unemployment fairly well, but does less well
matching non-participation. Our results also indicate that allowing for duration dependence in
flows between unemployment and non-participation is crucial for explaining overall levels in
long-term joblessness, and that changes in the duration distribution among the unemployed and
non-participants contributed less to the deterioration of labor market conditions in Canada,
relative to the U.S. In part, this difference comes from the fact that the U.S. recession was much
more severe.

Introduction

The textbook model of the labor market features a matching function mapping unmet search demand
and supply into new employment relationships (Mortensen and Pissarides [1994]; Pissarides [1985]). In
previous work, we examined how this framework performed over the Great Recession in the United States
in accounting for the dramatic rise in long-term unemployment and the outward shift in the Beveridge
curve (Kroft et al. [2016]). Our main result was that a standard matching model with unemployment (U)
and vacancies (V) and a constant job finding rate did a poor job reproducing these stylized facts. We
thus enriched this matching model along two dimensions. First, we allowed for duration dependence in
the job finding rate of the unemployed, consistent with a range of empirical evidence (e.g., experimental
work such as Kroft et al. [2013] and recent structural econometric work such as Bentolila et al. [2017]).
Second, we allowed for flows between the labor market states employment (E), unemployment (U), and
non-participation (N), instead of focusing exclusively on flows between employment and unemployment,
as in the standard matching model.1 We calibrated our enriched matching model and found that it
accounted for most the rise in long-term unemployment and about half of the outward shift in the
Beveridge curve.
In this paper, we compare the labor market dynamics in Canada and the U.S. before, during, and
after the Great Recession, building on the model in Kroft et al. [2016] and using restricted-use panel
from the Canadian Labor Force Survey (LFS) – the counterpart to the U.S. Current Population Survey
(CPS). This comparison is of interest because, as we demonstrate, the dynamics of the Great Recession
in Canada and the U.S. were quite different. By focusing on Canada, we thus subject our matching model
to a new “out-of-sample” test. In the process, we also expand and build on our prior analysis in several
ways to make five additional contributions.
First, we document how the U.S. labor market has evolved since March 2013 (where our prior analysis
left off). Our results indicate that the model continues to track long-term unemployment share fairly
well and accounts for some of the outward shift of the Beveridge curve. However, the model continues
to over-estimate the job finding rate among non-participants and thus under-estimate the stock of nonparticipants. This remains one of the enduring puzzles of the Great Recession in the U.S.
Second, we present new evidence on unemployment dynamics in Canada during the Great Recession
and compare Canada to the U.S. We document a rise in long-term unemployment in Canada that was
less pronounced than the rise in the U.S. Similar to what Kroft et al. [2016] found for the U.S., we find
that observables cannot explain the rise in long-term unemployment; rather, the increase was widespread
1 Throughout

the paper, we will use non-participation (N) and out-of-labor force (OLF) interchangeably.

across demographic groups. We also find that at the onset of the recession in Canada, job finding rates
among the unemployed declined by similar amounts in the U.S. and in Canada; however, the decline
in the job finding rate in the U.S. persisted for much longer. Our results indicate that Canada did
not experience a decline in the rate at which non-participants transitioned into employment, which also
contrasts with our findings for the U.S.
Third, we exploit a unique feature in the LFS data to study the dynamics of flows between labor
force states. Similar to the CPS, the LFS records the length of ongoing unemployment spells for the
unemployed. In addition to this, the LFS (but not the CPS) reports time elapsed since last employed for
both non-participants and the unemployed.2 We refer to this meaure as “joblessness duration” and we
explore how labor market flows involving non-participants vary with it. We find that the job finding rates
for non-participants decline with the duration of joblessness and this decline is of the same magnitude as
the one observed among the unemployed. Furthermore, we find that the unemployed become more likely
to transition to non-participation and non-participants become less likely to transition to unemployment
as the duration of joblessness increases.
Fourth, our finding that flows involving non-participants vary with the duration of joblessness motivates us to augment and improve the matching model in Kroft et al. [2016] in a straightforward yet
important direction. We calibrate our extended matching model using a similar approach to that in Kroft
et al. [2016] and find that allowing for duration dependence in joblessness for all flows involving nonparticipants helps account for the observed levels in long-term joblessness and their changes during the
2008-2009 recession. By contrast, allowing for duration dependence in all flows helps – but is not central
to – understanding the aggregate rates of employment, unemployment, and non-participation observed
over the same time-period. The observed behavior of these stocks is dominated by average flows between
the three labor force states, which can be adequately captured without modeling long-term joblessness.
Our fifth contribution is to construct a new vacancy series for Canada, which we use to develop a
Beveridge curve for Canada. This is necessary because (to our knowledge) there is no widely-accepted
2 There are a priori reasons why one might want to use measures of joblessness duration as opposed to unemployment
duration. As noted by Clark and Summers [1979], joblessness duration is a much more useful measure than unemployment
duration in order to understand the costs of unemployment. Joblessness duration, as opposed to unemployment duration,
is also conceptually easier for survey respondents to understand since it does not require actively tracking time spent
searching for a job. Kudlyak and Lange [2017] document that the duration data based on the survey responses in the CPS
is inconsistent with the observed patterns of unemployment, non-participation, and employment observed in the CPS. In
many instances, individuals report long durations of unemployment even though they were just observed to transition from
non-participation or employment to unemployment. In part, these responses are in fact consistent with the questions asked
by the CPS. The duration question in the CPS refers to time spend searching for employment. Respondents may report
long durations even though they just transitioned from employment into non-employed because they continued searching
while holding stop-gap jobs. That is, the CPS-respondents might often give logically consistent answers to the questions
they are asked, while labor market researchers make a logical leap in interpreting these data as representing unemployment
durations. Kudlyak and Lange [2017] also present evidence from the 4-month CPS panels in the U.S. that suggests the
same patterns of how joblessness affects transitions that we observe in Canada are also present in the U.S. In particular,
they show that job finding rates conditional on non-participation decline rapidly in the duration since last employment.

vacancy series in Canada that spans the years before, during, and after the Great Recession. Our vacancy
measure is based on relative employment in “recruiting industries” and is inspired by Landais et al. [2018].
Landais et al. [2018] use employment in recruiting industries to create a reliable proxy for the U.S., where
vacancy data are more widely-available and so the proxy can be validated. We follow the same approach
to create a proxy for vacancies in Canada. We use this proxy to calibrate the Canadian matching model
and to construct a Beveridge curve for Canada. We demonstrate that the Beveridge curves in Canada
and the U.S. have a broadly similar shape. However, unlike the U.S., the Beveridge curve in Canada did
not shift outward significantly during the Great Recession.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data sources used in the
analysis and the construction of our vacancy proxy using “recruiting industries”. In Section 3, we compare
and contrast the recessions in Canada and the U.S. Section 4 analyzes the composition of the long-term
unemployed and the “long-term jobless” out of the labor force. Section 5 revisits the analysis in Kroft
et al. [2016] using U.S. data, replicating the main results and extending the results to the most recent data
available. Section 6, focuses on the Canadian experience during the Great Recession. It describes the
incidence of long-term joblessness among the unemployed in Canada, reports results from the composition
analysis of long-term joblessness, describes the extension of the model to account for joblessness duration,
and discusses the model calibration and counterfactual results using the restricted-use LFS data. Section
7 concludes.

Data

This section briefly describes our data sources. See Kroft et al. [2016] for more details on the U.S. data.

2.1

United States

Current Population Survey (CPS)
We use monthly CPS data between January 2002 and October 2015 (extending beyond the April 2013
end date in Kroft et al. [2016]). Our sample comprises all employed, unemployed, and non-participants
aged 25-55. The data is age-adjusted to the 2000 age distribution.3 In the cross-section, we keep track
3 Specifically,

we adjust the sum of the weights for each age (in years) to be equal to the sum of the weights for the same
age in the base year 2000. In the U.S., this age adjustment has a negligible effect on trends in the employment rate. This
comes from the fact that we have limited the sample to ages 25-55. If we had instead used a 25-65 age range, then the trend
in the employment rate would be more sensitive to whether or not we had adjusted for changes in age composition. This is
because most of the changes in age distribution from 2000 until 2016 is concentrated above age 55. These results are shown
in Appendix Figures 29 through 31. Thus, the main age restriction (which we carry throughout the paper) makes our main
results likely insensitive to whether or not we age-adjust the sample.

of the total population of each category to estimate the “stocks”. To create panel data, we match observations across successive months, matching on household identifier, line number, age, gender, and race.
We use the matched panel data in addition to the CPS cross-sectional estimates of the unemployed, the
employed, and non-participants to estimate the transition rates between unemployment, employment,
and non-participation in each month. We also compute overall (pre-2008) transition rates by unemployment duration (into both employment and non-participation). Finally, we compute transition rates from
employment and non-participation into unemployment, by unemployment duration.

Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)
We use monthly JOLTS data to compute the total number of vacancies. We use these vacancy data to
calibrate the matching model during the pre-2008 period. We then use the post-2008 vacancy data as
one of the exogenous forcing variables for our counterfactual scenarios.

2.2

Canada

Labor Force Survey (LFS)
We use restricted-access Canadian Labor Force Survey (LFS) data. The definition of unemployment varies
somewhat between Canada and the U.S.. To be able to compare the data from the two countries, we
went back to the survey responses to the LFS and recoded labor force states in the LFS to be comparable
to those from the CPS (see Bernard and Usalcas [2014] and references contain therein). Similar to the
U.S., we limit ourselves to the age range 25-55 and re-weight the data to match the 2000 age distribution
in Canada. We also force the transition rates to be consistent with the cross-sectional data on stocks
using the methodology described in Kroft et al. [2016].
An important advantage of the Canadian data is that respondents are asked about the duration of
joblessness in addition to the duration of unemployment. As Elsby et al. [2013] and Kroft et al. [2016]
both report, unemployment durations as usually constructed based on the CPS are frequently inconsistent
with the observed panel of labor force states when observations in the CPS are linked to construct an
individual-level panel data set. In the CPS, unemployed respondents are asked to report how long they
have been actively looking for a job. It has become standard practice to use reported durations in response
to this question as indicating unemployment durations. If respondents interpreted this question as labor
statisticians would like them to, they should report durations of less than a month when surveyed in the
month after a transition from either employment or out of the labor force to unemployment. However,
respondents often report substantially longer durations of unemployment during these months. Kudlyak

5

and Lange [2017] present evidence that respondents might include short jobs (stop-gap jobs) during which
they continued to search for more permanent employment when they answered this question. By contrast,
the question on the duration of joblessness in the LFS is relatively simple to interpret. This suggests
that responses to the duration of joblessness are more likely to align with the concept in question. In
addition, the duration of joblessness question is asked both of the unemployed and of non-participants.
We therefore focus on joblessness duration for the bulk of our empirical analysis, both for conceptual
reasons and to have same duration concept for both unemployed individuals and non-participants.

2.3

A New Vacancy Series for Canada

In Kroft et al. [2016], we used the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) to compute the total
number of vacancies each month in the U.S.. Unfortunately, to our knowledge there is no counterpart data
series in Canada that allows us to directly compute vacancies for the relevant time period. The vacancy
measure from the Job Vacancy Statistics (JVS) series is only available since 2011 and the measure from
the Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) is only available since 2015.4 While other data sources exist,
none are adequate for our purposes.5
Recently, Landais et al. [2018] developed a proxy for vacancies in the U.S. This proxy is called the
“recruiting-producer ratio” and is defined theoretically as the ratio of the number of recruiters relative
to the numbers of workers engaged in production. Empirically, Landais et al. [2018] define this ratio as:

τ=

ρ × rec
l − ρ × rec

where rec is the seasonally-adjusted monthly number of workers in “recruiting industries”, defined as employment in North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 56131, and l is the seasonallyadjusted monthly number of workers in all private industries.6 The parameter ρ is a scaling factor used
to adjust for labor devoted to recruiting by firms not belonging to the recruiting industry and therefore
not captured by rec. In the U.S., Landais et al. [2018] set ρ = 8.4 based on survey evidence from 1997.
Why should this measure be correlated with vacancies? The basic idea is that when firms are posting
4 The

JVS is reported monthly and the data is collected at the establishment level, whereas the JVWS is reported
quarterly and the data is collected at the business location level. The JVWS also has a larger sample, and includes
vacancies from businesses primarily involved in agriculture, which the JVS does not. For more information on these two
vacancy series, see the publication http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-514-g/75-514-g2015002-eng.htm.
5 The Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses (CFIB) produces a survey of vacancies. However, it suffers from a
number of limitations. First, it excludes the public and utilities sector. Second, it allows for passive job search and doesn’t
require an open position to exist, just for the business to have an unmet need. Third, it comes from registered CFIB
members who voluntarily take the “Your Business Outlook Survey”. Non-responses to the vacancy question are coded as
zero vacancies. The other source of vacancy data comes from the Conference Board which uses online data from roughly 80
job-posting websites collected by WANTED Technologies. However, this vacancy series also suffers from serious limitations
and was in fact discontinued because of reliability issues.

relatively more jobs, there are more resources allocated to recruiting. Thus, τ should be procyclical, and
this is indeed what Landais et al. [2018] find.
In our analysis, we follow Landais et al. [2018] and use employment in recruiting industries in Canada
as a proxy for the ratio of vacancies to the population. Unfortunately, employment counts by 5-digit
NAICS codes are not available in Canada. Thus, we instead use employment in the 4-digit NAICS
industry code 5613 measured in the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH) to measure the
number of employees employed in the recruiting industries.
To construct τ , we also need an estimate of ρ, the proportionality factor meant to capture the ratio
of workers outside the recruiting industry that are engaged in recruiting. We expect our estimate ρ to
be smaller than the estimate from Landais et al. [2018] since we define the recruiting industry to be
broader.7 Below, we estimate the adjustment factor ρ as one of the parameters entering the matching
function. The estimate will depend on the model specification and in particular on whether we allow for
duration dependence in the job finding rates of the unemployed and/or non-participants. Our preferred
specification allows for both duration dependence among the unemployed and non-participants. ρ for our
preferred specification is 2.6 and we will use this value when we describe the vacancy series. Fortunately,
the measure τ and its cyclical properties are robust to variation in ρ; the time series of τ varies little even
when we employ substantially different values for ρ.
Figure 1 compares the recruiter-producer ratio in the U.S. with the vacancy measure taken from
JOLTS and also shows the recruiter-producer ratio for Canada, calculated using the SEPH data. Note
that in the U.S., the recruiter-producer ratios based on NAICS code 56131 and 5613 behave very similarly
over time, suggesting that basing our vacancy series on the 4-digit NAICS code in Canada will not be a
major problem for our analysis. Morever, it suggests that we should not be surprised to recover a similar
scaling factor, even though we are using a broader employment category.
Furthermore, the recruiter-producer ratio and JOLTS evolve similarly over time in the U.S. – the
decline by similar amounts at the onset of the 2001 and 2008 recessions and likewise recover by comparable
relative amounts subsequent to these recessions. To provide another way of validating the vacancy proxy
in the U.S., in the Appendix we report predicted job finding rates (for both unemployed and nonparticipants) in the U.S. using both the JOLTS measure as well as the recruiter-producer ratio proxy.
The predicted job finding rates are very similar across the two measures, bolstering the case that the
proxy based on the recruiter-producer ratio in Canada may be an adequate substitute for a JOLTS-like
vacancy series which does not exist for a sufficiently long period in Canada for our analysis.
Overall, comparing the U.S. and the Canadian time series patterns in vacancies as measured by the

recruiter-producer ratio, we find that over the last recession, the recruiter-producer ratio declined less in
Canada than in the U.S. This finding lines up with the general observation that the recession was less
severe in Canada than the Great Recession in the U.S. – Canada instead experienced a “Not-Quite-Great
Recession”.

The 2008-2009 Recessions in Canada and the U.S.: A Brief
Overview

3.1

Unemployment and Employment-to-Population Rates

Both Canada and the U.S. experienced a rapid, sharp increase in the unemployment rate during the
Great Recession, but the magnitude, persistence, and onset of the Great Recession differed between the
two countries. The NBER determined that the U.S. was in a recession for 18 months from December
2007 to June 2009, while the recession in Canada lasted only 7 months from November 2008 to May
2009.8 The recessions differed not just in length but also in their severity. The movements in key labor
market outcomes, illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, were about twice as large in the U.S. as in Canada.
Figure 2 shows that for the U.S., the unemployment rate among 25-55 year olds increased by about 5
percentage points over the Great Recession, compared to a 2.5 percentage point in the unemployment rate
in Canada. In the U.S., the employment-to-population ratio (Figure 3) declined by about 4 percentage
points compared to a 2 percentage point decline in Canada.9
The figures also show that Canada recovered more rapidly than the U.S. By mid-2010, the unemployment rate in Canada had dropped back by about half of its increase in 2009, while in the U.S. the
unemployment rate remained at levels similar to those in late 2009. Since then, both Canada and the
U.S. slowly returned to unemployment rates comparable to the pre-recession period. However, the U.S.
has only managed to claw back about half of the decrease in the employment-to-population ratio, while
Canada returned to the pre-recession levels of the employment-to-population ratio by the end of 2012.

3.2

Long-Term Unemployment and Joblessness

In addition to the overall increase in unemployment, the Great Recession also increased unemployment
at long durations. Figure 4 shows the share of the unemployed with unemployment durations exceeding

distributions in the two countries.

6 months for the U.S. and the share of the unemployed with unemployment (not joblessness) durations
exceeding 26 weeks for Canada. In both countries, the long-term unemployment (LTU) share increased
significantly, but the rise was much more pronounced in the U.S. In the U.S., the LTU share increased
by about 25 percentage points, while in Canada it rose by only about 10 percentage points. Additionally,
the decline in the LTU shares in both countries has been very slow. By October 2015, the LTU share in
the U.S. was about 30 percent and in Canada it was about 20 percent.
As described above, a useful feature of the Canadian data is that we can observe joblessness durations
for both the unemployed and non-participants, which is something that the CPS does not keep track of.
Figure 5 shows the share of long-term joblessness (LTJ) for the unemployed. We see that it fluctuates
in the pre-recession period around 45 percent and increases to rougly 55 percent in the post-recession
period. Among the unemployed, the increase in percentage points in long-term joblessness is of the same
magnitude as the increase in long-term unemployment. In percent, it is much smaller since the base
incidence of long-term joblessness is substantially larger.
Figure 6 shows the share of long-term joblessness for non-participants. Rates of long-term joblessness
are much higher for non-participants than they are for the unemployed. This reflects the fact that this

group is composed of many individuals who are not on the margin of entering the labor market. Similar
to the trends for the unemployed, the LTJ share among non-participants declined prior to the recession
and increased moderately during the recession. While most of the increase in long-term joblessness
concentrated in the first few months of the Great Recession among the unemployed, the increase in LTJ
among non-participants has been much more gradual. It is indeed not clear whether this increase in
LTJ has run its course by October 2015, when our data ends. Overall, the relative increase in LTJ is
much more pronounced among the unemployed since the share of LTJ is of course much lower among
the unemployed. Nevertheless, since there are many more non-participants as compared to unemployed,
an increase of 4 percentage points in the LTJ share among non-participants is an important empirical
pattern.

3.3

Transition Rates

Figure 7 provides another way of examining the relative labor market performance in Canada and the
U.S. over time. It shows the job finding rates and the job loss rates depending on whether they involve
unemployment or non-participation. We present smoothed data by taking 6-month moving averages.
The top two panels show the job finding rates conditional on U or N and the bottom two panels show
the rates at which the employed transition into U or N.
Starting with the job loss rates, we see that for Canada, the E-to-U rate increased slightly from
1 percent to about 1.5 percent, but quickly returned back to normal levels. By contrast, in the U.S.
the E-to-U rate increased from about 1 percent to around 2 percent and remained elevated during the
Great Recession. In both countries, the rates at which individuals transitioned from employment to nonparticipation remained relatively stable. Considering the job finding rates, we observe an initial decline
for the unemployed that is similar in size in both Canada and the U.S. However, Canada returned to its
prior levels more rapidly. Among non-participants, unlike the U.S. which experienced a drop in the job
finding rate, we do not observe a significant decline in job finding rates in Canada. It is striking that in
the U.S., job finding rates among non-participants so far have not fully recovered to their pre-recession
levels.
It is thus not the initial decline in job finding rates among the unemployed that explains why the
2008-2009 recession was “Great” in the U.S. and not in Canada. Rather, the persistence in the decline of
job finding rates and job loss rates account for the severity of the recession in the U.S.. Canada escaped
a Great Recession primarily because its labor market rebounded more quickly and because job finding
rates among those out of the labor force did not deteriorate substantially.

Beveridge Curve

The Beveridge curve is one of the main diagnostic tools used to understand the labor market performance
over the business cycle. Using the vacancy series constructed according to the recruiter-producer ratio we
are in a position to produce what we believe to be the first monthly Beveridge curve for Canada covering
this entire time period.
Figure 8 shows this Beveridge curve depicting the vacancy-to-population rate and the unemploymentto-population rate in our data. The data depicted here are quarterly averages running from Q1 2001 to
Q3 2015. Figure 8 clearly depicts the downward-sloping relationship familiar from Beveridge curves in
other countries such as the U.S. or the UK. Compared to the U.S., we do not see a substantial “outward
shift” in the Beveridge curve in Canada. We also show the analogous relationship between vacancies and
non-participants in Figure 9. It is clear that there is less of a systematic relationship between vacancies
and non-participants than between vacancies and unemployment.

The Role of Composition for Trends in Long-Term Unemployment and Long-Term Joblessness in Canada

As described above (see Figures 5 and 6), the rates of long-term unemployment and long-term joblessness
in Canada rose sharply at the end of 2009 and have since remained elevated. Roughly half of the increase
still remains. We now explore this increase in more depth. We first assess how much of the increase
can be accounted for by changes in the observable composition of the unemployed and non-participants.
Specifically, we consider education (high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, and college
graduate), age (six 5-year age groups between 25 and 55), region, and gender. We proceed to separately
investigate the role of composition across these categories in the time-patterns of the LTU among the
unemployed and LTJ among non–participants. Long-term unemployment and long-term joblessness are
both defined using a 6-month cut-off.
In the Appendix, we present both the incidence and share of LTU conditional on each of the above
listed characteristics among the unemployed. These figures illustrate that the variation in LTU over
time is quite similar across different characteristics. Furthermore, when there is variation in LTU across
observable characteristics, the share of the different groups among the unemployed does not change
dramatically when the recession hits. Consequently, these figures suggest that there is limited scope for
changes in the composition of the unemployed to account for the overall change in LTU for unemployed
workers.
Figure 10 combines all of these characteristics together to predict the change in LTU from compositional changes in the sample of unemployed individuals using a shift-share procedure. We find that the
predicted change in the overall LTU share based on compositional changes is very small, mirroring the
results we found in Kroft et al. [2016] for the U.S. To create this figure, we go through each characteristic
(gender, age, etc.) and we predict the change in LTU based on the change in composition after 2008 and
the 2002 incidence of LTU for this characteristic. We then sum these predicted changes across all of the
characteristics.10 Our projection uses each of the characteristics shown in Appendix.
We repeat the same exercise for non-participants. In the Appendix, we show a similar pattern of
long-term joblessness across education groups, but large differences in levels. In addition to the large
10 As noted to us by Andrew Berger-Gross, our procedure may overstate the role of composition if there are correlated
compositional changes among groups with a high incidence of LTU in the initial period. An alternative procedure would
instead calculate the incidence of LTU for narrower cells (e.g., LTU for each gender-age-region-education cell) and then follow
the same procedure but using only this one “combined characteristic” defined by this mutually exclusive and collectively
exhaustive set of cells. This procedure is less prone to upward bias, but in practice it likely limits the number of characteristics
one can use due to the curse of dimensionality. In public-use CPS data, we have verified that this alternative procedure
produces extremely similar results to our procedure. In either case, one concludes that there is no strong role for composition
in understanding overall trends in LTU.

pre-recession differences in LTJ levels by education, there are also meaningfully different trends in the
composition of long-term jobless non-participants, with more long-term jobless non-participants having
high education in recent years (as compared to earlier years). Despite these differences in levels and
trends by education, however, the limited overall role of compositional changes in accounting for LTJ
trends among non-participants is shown in Figure 11. As with the long-term unemployed in both U.S.
and Canada, the results suggest no meaningful role for compositional changes in accounting for national
trends in long-term joblessness.
Thus, the overall rise in LTU and LTJ in Canada after 2009 was not isolated to specific demographic
groups, but rather was experienced broadly across the labor market. These results using observables do of
course not speak directly to the potential for compositional changes based on unobservables. Nevertheless,
they do suggest that changes in the composition of the unemployed are not driving the observed patterns
in LTJ during the recession.

Replicating and Extending Kroft et al. [2016]

So far, we have shown how the labor market experience in Canada during the last recession differed
from the U.S. experience. For the remainder of the paper, we explore the ability of a standard matching
model augmented with duration dependence in labor market flows to match the observed patterns in
unemployment and non-participation as well as long-term unemployment and joblessness over the business
cycle. This work builds substantially on Kroft et al. [2016], and we begin by reviewing the methodology
employed in that paper.11 Our treatment here is sparse, and we refer the reader to Kroft et al. [2016] for
details.
The Matching Function
At the core of our analysis of the U.S. labor market in Kroft et al. [2016] is a matching function which
determines the number of meetings between job openings and both unemployed and non-participants.
α

M (Ut + sNt , Vt ) = m0 (Ut + sNt ) Vt1−α

(1)

The (Ut , Nt ) variables are the stocks of unemployed and non-participants; Vt are vacancies and (m0 , s, α)
are parameters. One can interpret (Ut + sNt ) as the total units of search effort on the labor supply side
where each unit of search effort delivers an identical probability of a meeting with a vacancy. Then s
represents the relative search effort of those deemed out of the labor force. The probability of a meeting
per unit of search effort is

M (Ut +sNt ,Vt )
Ut +sNt

= m0 x1−α
where xt =
t

Vt
Ut +sNt

is a measure of market tightness

that accounts for non-participants.12
The function A(d) is defined as the relative job finding rates of the unemployed with durations
of unemployment d. This function captures “true” duration dependence (sometimes called “structural
duration dependence”); i.e., the genuine causal effect of longer durations on the job finding rate. As
described in Kroft et al. [2016], this modeling assumption is motivated partly by recent field experimental
evidence on duration dependence in “callbacks” for interviews (Ghayad [2013], Kroft et al. [2013]). It is
also consistent with recent structural econometric work that finds evidence of “true” duration dependence
using population-level data from Spain (Bentolila et al. [2017]) and with recent work finding a causal
effect of duration of joblessness on re-employment wages (Nekoei and Weber [2017], Schmieder et al.
[2016]), since these papers interpret these results as suggesting human capital depreciation, which would
cause “true” duration dependence. We emphasize that understanding how much of the A(d) function

that we estimated from observation data represents “true” duration dependence remains very much an
open question, with a range of recent evidence suggesting a smaller role for “true” duration dependence
in generating observed pattern of duration dependence (Farber et al. [2015], Ahn and Hamilton [2016],
Jarosch and Pilossoph [2016]). In this paper, we will proceed under the assumption that we have access
to the function A(d) representing “true” duration dependence. The job finding rates of the unemployed
with duration d and the non-participants in Kroft et al. [2016] are given by

λU E (xt ; d)
λN E (xt )

= A(d)m0 x1−α
t

(2)

= sm0 x1−α
t

(3)

We normalize A(0) = 1 and assume that A(d) follows a double-exponential decay function. We
estimate the parameters of A(d) and the parameter s using data on job finding rates by duration and
non-participation from the period 2002-2007 preceding the Great Recession. The functional form and
parameters of the functions M (U + sN, V ) and A(d) and s are constant over time. Thus, when we
examine the performance of our model over the Great Recession, we ask whether the search environment
accounting for duration dependence is stable over the Great Recession except for the demand for labor.
Simulating labor flows
To simulate the labor market, we need to measure or model flows between all three labor force states
(E, U, N ). In addition, we need to measure or model the duration distribution of the flows into unemE

(d) and λN
ployment. Above, we showed how to model the endogenous flows into employment: λU
t
t

The remaining flows in the labor market are exogenous processes in our analysis. As stated in Kroft et al.
[2016], to construct these flows we assume that if “non-participants move to unemployment, they draw
an unemployment duration from the (empirical) distribution of unemployment durations estimated from
observed N-to-U transitions.” Similarly, when employed workers move into unemployment, they draw an
unemployment duration from the empirical distribution of unemployment durations.13 These two empirical distributions are defined as θtN U (d) and θtEU (d), respectively. The dynamic equations governing
changes in the stocks are then

13 One of the lessons we draw from the analysis in this paper as well as in Kroft et al. [2016] is that it is crucial to
account for the fact that transitions between unemployment and non-participation vary across the duration distribution.
The assumptions made in Kroft et al. [2016] are ad-hoc, but, as we will see below, they do succeed in roughly accounting for
the fact that the durations reported by non-participants that transition to unemployment are relatively long. The advantage
of the data on long-term joblessness for both U and N available in Canada is that we can replace these ad-hoc assumptions
with direct measurements of the durations of those transitioning.

5.1

Updating Kroft et al. [2016] to Oct. 2015

The analysis in Kroft et al. [2016] use data up until April 2013. In this Section, we explore the implications
and performance of the model since then.

Discrepancy from Kroft et al. [2016]
Before we turn to the updated analysis, we regret to report that some of the results shown here for the
period up to April 2013 differ slightly from those reported in Kroft et al. [2016]. In preparation for this
paper, we revisited the code used for Kroft et al. [2016] and discovered a coding error in the dynamic
equations used to construct the flows. In particular, the code did not exactly implement equations (4) (7) (which were written correctly in the published paper). Upon re-running the analysis, we found that
this mistake did not affect our main conclusions, but it did have some effect on a few of the quantitative
results.
In Figure 12, we compare the predicted and observed shares in LTU in Panel A and B. Panel A shows
the results updated to October 2015 using our original code. By contrast, Panel B shows results using
the updated code. Using the corrected code, Panel B shows that we underestimate the actual share of
long-term unemployed during the Great Recession by about 5 to 10 percentage points. The mean error
in the (out-of-sample) prediction is about −6.8 percentage points (with a mean squared prediction error
of 0.0057, or 57 squared percentage points).
Comparing Panels A and B, one sees that the consequence of the coding mistake is that Kroft et al.
[2016] reported a higher LTU share in our counterfactual series than warranted. By implication, our
reported counterfactual job finding rate for the unemployed was too low. Consequently, while our prior
simulations from Kroft et al. [2016] fit the job finding rates conditional on unemployment very closely, we
now tend to find a counterfactual job finding rate conditional on unemployment that exceeds the actual
job finding rate by about 2 percentage points in the period following the Great Recession (see Panel A

in 13). This tends to narrow as the discrepancy in the LTU share declines towards the later years.
The consequence of this coding discrepancy is fairly minor relative to the observed job finding rates
that typically vary between 20 and 30 percent. Thus, this does not substantively affect the ability of the
model to fit the simulated stocks in the labor market and leaves our main conclusions largely unchanged.
We still find that the model can account for a large share of the increase in LTU and some of the outward
shift in the Beveridge curve, and we continue to find (as before) that the model does not do a good job
accounting for trends in non-participation during and after the Great Recession.14

Kroft et al. [2016] since April 2013
How did the model fare in the two-and-a-half years since we completed the previous analysis? We find
that the model does quite well when considering the share of LTU (Figure 12) and the job finding rates
conditional on unemployment (Figure 13). Indeed, on both dimensions the model does better after April
2013. Figure 12 shows that the stock of LTU declines rather slowly but steadily. By the end of 2015, the
observed and counterfactual share of LTU has declined to 35 and 30 percent respectively from about 50
and 40 percent respectively right after the Great Recession.
The model, however, fits the data much less well when we consider job finding rates among the nonparticipants. Those rates are consistently overestimated after 2008 (see Panel B of Figure 13,). The
persistent feature of the U.S. labor market that is most difficult to explain is not unemployment or
long-term unemployment, but non-participation since 2008.
Consider next the Beveridge curve shown in Figure 14. Since April 2013, labor demand as measured
by vacancies has continued to increase and unemployment continued to decline. However, even though
vacancies exceed the rates observed at any time between 2002 and 2007, unemployment however has not
declined to those levels seen in that period - indicating that the Beveridge curve has indeed shifted.
In Kroft et al. [2016] we reported that we could explain about half of the shift in the Beveridge curve
until April 2013 using the changing duration structure. A gap of about 1 percentage point however
remained to be explained outside of our model. Since then, we have seen the gap between the observed
and the counterfactual Beveridge curve close from a little above 1 percentage point to about half a
percentage point. Overall, the model does a fairly good job of accounting for these additional 30 month
of data on unemployment and vacancies.
14 We can use the average error (bias) and the mean squared error – calculated both “in sample” and “out of sample”
– in order to assess the goodness-of-fit for both panels of Figure 13. In Panel A, the “in sample” average error is -0.0022
and the MSE is 0.00034; the analogous “out of sample” statistics are 0.0199 and 0.00051, respectively. In Panel B, the
“in sample” average error is -0.0002 and the MSE is 0.00004, and the analogous “out of sample” statistics are 0.011 and
0.00018. Relative to the average job finding rates in each panel in the “in sample” pre-period, there is a greater bias in the
predictions for the N-to-E flows relative to the U-to-E flows.

As noted in Kroft et al. [2016], the model fails to explain by how much non-participation increased
during the Great Recession. This failure of the model persists after April 2013. This becomes apparent
when one considers the Beveridge curve in non-participation in Figure 15, which depicts the relation
between non-participation and vacancies. It should be noted however that the failure comes almost
entirely from the counterfactually predicted sharp decline in non-participation up until April 2013 at a
time when we observed actual non-participation rates to increase. Since then, the model has tracked the
changes in the stock of non-participants quite well.
Overall, we conclude that over the additional two years out-of-sample, the model calibrated on 20022007 data continues to perform very well when matching the dynamics in long-term unemployment,
reasonably well when fitting the evolution of unemployment overall, but (as reported before) fails to
match the persistent decline in the stock of non-participants.

The 2008-2009 Recession in Canada: A Laboratory to Understand Counterfactuals

We now turn to the Canadian Labor market. The Canadian LFS, in contrast to its American counterpart
the CPS, contains data on how long individuals have been without work, regardless of whether they are

currently unemployed or non-participants. This allows us to extend the matching model to account
for a richer specification of how the duration of joblessness affects labor force transitions. The obvious
extension is to allow the job finding rate of both the unemployed and those out of the labor force to
depend on how long individuals have been out of employment. Thus, we model the job finding rate for
those out of the labor force as follows:

λN E (d; xt ) = sB(d)m0 x1−α
t

(8)

where B(d) captures the duration dependence in the job finding rate among those out of the labor force.
This function is analogous to A(d) in equation (2).
In addition, with the LFS, we can now model how transitions between unemployment and nonparticipation depend on the duration of joblessness. To capture these, we model the duration-dependent

where C(d) and D(d) are functions capturing the duration structure in these transition rates. These
functions are obtained by averaging the transition rates over the entire data period and then allowing
for the relative transition rates to vary month-by-month up to duration of 24 months. After 2 years of
joblessness, transition rates are postulated not to vary with the length of joblessness any further.

6.1

Observed Duration Dependence in Labor Market Flows

Using the Canadian LFS between January 2001 and October 2015, we next describe how joblessness
durations affect labor market flows, including flows originating among those out of the labor force. These
flows are shown as functions of the duration of joblessness in Figure 16 for job finding rates and Figure
17 for flows between unemployment and non-participation.
For both groups, the job finding rate declines sharply over the first few months of joblessness and then
flattens out somewhat. At a duration of one year, the job finding rate is about one-third that of a newly
jobless individual, whether the individual is unemployed or out of the labor force. We also observe strong

Figure 17: Transitions U  N by Duration of Joblessness in Canada

Notes: This figure reports average monthly transition rates between unemployment and non-participation
by joblessness duration.
duration patterns in flows between unemployment and non-participation. Figure 17 shows that the probability of transitioning from unemployment to non-participation increases and the probability of making
a reverse transition from non–participation to unemployment declines steadily with joblessness duration.
These findings are consistent with research in the U.S. that finds that individuals are increasingly likely
to withdraw from the labor market the longer they are out of a job (Krueger et al. [2014]).
We use A(d) to describe duration dependence (in jobless duration) for unemployed workers, and B(d)
to describe duration dependence (in jobless duration) for non-participants. To capture these relationships,
we estimate two separate flexible nonlinear functions over the spell to allow for the possibility that the
pattern of duration dependence differs across these two groups. The functional form for both A(d) and
B(d) depends on two parameters and is (1 − a) + a ∗ exp(−b ∗ d). For both functions, we estimate
the parameters (a, b) using non-linear least squares (NLLS) regression based on the “cell” averages (i.e.,
average job finding rate by joblessness duration) across the time-period from January 2001 to October
2015. The NLLS estimation is weighted using the number of observations at that duration. The estimated
parameters are reported in Table 1.
Overall, we find that these functions fit the job finding rates across the duration distribution well (see
Appendix Figure 38.) Both functions show steep declines (of more than 50 percent) over the first several

months. For the unemployed, the function “flattens out” considerably after roughly six months, which
mirrors what has been found in the U.S. (Kroft et al. [2016]). For non-participants, the function also
steeply declines, but does not flatten out quite as rapidly, and also declines further in absolute terms:
after 12 months, the job finding rate of non-participants is less than 20 percent of a non-participant with
a jobless duration of 0, while for unemployed individuals the job finding rate (at 12 months) is roughly
30 − 40 percent of the job finding rate of an unemployed individual with duration of 0.
With these estimates, we next examine how job finding rates change over time based solely on changes
to the distribution of joblessness durations. For the unemployed, this is the average of the A(d) function
(averaged across stock of joblessness durations). Intuitively, in a recession, longer spells receive more
weight and so pull down the mean A(d). For Canada, the mean is roughly 52 percent in the pre-recession
period and drops to about 48 percent during the recession as can be seen in Figure 18 . This compares with
a drop from about 75 percent to about 65 percent during the Great Recession in the US. The smaller
decline in A(d) in Canada compared to the U.S. is consistent with the trends in LTU/LTJ for both
countries, showing that the recession was much deeper in the U.S. and generated much more long-term
unemployment.
For non-participants, we report how the job finding rate conditional on non-participation evolved
solely based on the distribution of the duration of joblessness. This measure is obtained by averaging

B(d) is much lower than the average A(d), starting around 25 percent in the pre-recession period and
falling to about 23 percent during the recession. This reflects the fact that most of the jobless among
the non-participants have very long spells and long-term joblessness increased only slightly for this group
during the recession.

Calibrating the Extended Matching Model with Canadian data

To calibrate the matching model in equations (2) to (8), we require estimates of the parameters entering
the matching function (s, m0 , α, ξ) as well as the functions A(d), B(d), C(d), and D(d). We described in
the previous section the functional form and estimation of A(d) and B(d). For the functions C(d) and
D(d), we use the transition rates by month of joblessness duration averaged over the period from January
2001 to October 2015. We do not impose a functional form on C(d) and D(d) and show them in Figure
17.
To estimate the matching parameters (s, m0 , α, ξ) we only use the data up to the onset of the recession
in October 2008. The parameter estimates of the matching model as well as estimates of A(d) and B(d)
are shown in Table 1.15
15 As

in Kroft et al. [2016], we estimate the model parameters using a minimum distance procedure that minimizes the sum

Figure 20 shows the observed and fitted job finding rates for the unemployed from January 2001 to
October 2015. The figure shows both the fit for the full model allowing for both duration dependence
among the unemployed and those out of the labor force, as well as the fit for a model that is restricted to
allow only for duration dependence among the unemployed. The predicted values for these two models
overlap almost perfectly. Overall, we see that the model fits the overall decline in job finding rates fairly
well, with the exception of the initial decline in observed job finding rates.
As we calculated for the model predictions for the U.S. data (see Figure 13 and footnote 14), we
calculated the average error (bias) and the mean squared error (MSE) – both “in sample” and “out of
sample” – in order to assess goodness-of-fit. In Figure 20, the “in sample” average error is -0.00002 and the
MSE is 0.0003 for the “No Duration Dependence” model. For the full model with duration dependence
among both the unemployed and those out of the labor force, the average error is -0.00004 and the MSE is
0.0003. The analogous out-of-sample statistics are 0.0129 and 0.0005 for the “No Duration Dependence”
model and 0.0048 and 0.0006 for the full model. Thus, the full model has similar MSE out of sample as
the model with no duration dependence, but has much smaller average error (bias).
Figure 21 shows the observed and fitted job finding rates among non-participants. Here we find that
of squared differences between the model-predicted U-to-E and N-to-E flows and the observed flows. We prefer to evaluate
the model fit using the average error and mean squared error for the predicted flows to employment (from unemployment
and non-participation), but an alternative measure of model fit could be constructed based on test statistics from the
minimim distance procedure.

allowing for duration dependence in both U and N improves the fit of the model. The thick line shows the
fit of our preferred model, while the dashed line shows the fit without duration dependence among those
out of the labor force. The restricted model overestimates the job finding rate among non-participants
after 2012, while the unrestricted model does a reasonable job of fitting these later periods as well.
Overall, we note that the model fits the decline in the job finding rate reasonably well.
It is noteworthy that in Canada, but not in the U.S., the matching model estimated on the prerecession period matches the job finding rates even after the recession. This is true even if we estimate
the restricted model in Kroft et al. [2016] rather than the model with enriched dynamics (equations (8),
(9), and (10)). In either case, the matching model estimated on Canadian data fits the job finding rates
both quantitatively and qualitatively, while in the U.S. we underestimate the decline in the job finding
rate especially among those out of the labor force.16
16 Using the same goodness-of-fit statistics reported for previous figures showing model-based job finding rates, the “in
sample” average error is 0.00006 and the MSE is 0.00003 for the “No Duration Dependence” model. For the full model
with duration dependence among both the unemployed and those out of the labor force, the average error is 0.0001 and the
MSE is 0.00002. The analogous out-of-sample statistics are 0.0043 and 0.00005 for the “No Duration Dependence” model
and 0.0037 and 0.00004 for the full model. Thus, the full model has somewhat smaller average error than the “No Duration
Dependence” model, and both of these models have smaller average error than the analogous statistics for predicted N-to-E
flows in the U.S. data.

Counterfactual Results

Figures 20 and 21 were constructed using the observed distributions of the duration of joblessness across
the entire time period. These figures therefore do not speak to how well the model performs in generating
counterfactual distributions across (U, N, E) and across the duration of joblessness. We now turn to
counterfactual simulations that allow us to probe how well the model of labor force flows developed here
describes the dynamics of the labor market overall.
In particular, we simulate the model using as exogenous forcing variables the vacancy series, the job
loss rates conditional on U and N , and the transition rates between U and N observed in the data.17 We
keep constant the parameters of the matching model (equations (2) and (8)) and the relative transition
rates A(d), B(d), C(d), and D(d).
We begin by using the dynamic equations to simulate long-term joblessness (>26 weeks) among the
unemployed and those out of the labor force. Figure 22 shows the observed share of long-term joblessness
(>26 weeks) among the unemployed as well as for 3 different counterfactual scenarios starting in October
2008. The dashed thin line refers to the model without any duration dependence. Surprisingly, this
model does fairly well in fitting the long-term joblessness distribution conditional on unemployment. The
thick dashed line (labeled “DD in U”) shows the counterfactuals based on a model that allows only for
duration dependence among the job finding rates of the unemployed, but not among non-participants,
nor in U  N flows. This model predicts a larger share of long-term joblessness than observed in the
data. It does so because it does not account for the fact that many of those unemployed for long periods
become non-participants (see Figure 17). By contrast, the full model allowing for duration dependence
in job finding rates among both the unemployed and those out of the labor force and also for duration
dependence in flows U  N fits the observed data better than the other models.
Figure 23 shows the same data and counterfactuals for the long-term jobless conditional on being out
of the labor force. Models that do not allow for duration dependence in the job finding rates of nonparticipants as well as in flows between unemployment and non-participation under-estimate the share of
long-term joblessness among the non-participants. This is because these models do not capture the large
unbalanced flows between unemployment and non-participation at high durations of joblessness. Once
we allow for duration dependence in these flows, we can fit the patterns in long-term joblessness quite
well using the stable matching framework and a duration structure that is unchanged over the study
period.
17 For the latter, we take the average transition rates λ
U N and λN U as well as the duration distribution observed in the
data to construct the rates of transitioning between U and N conditional on duration 0. These are used as the forcing
variables in the dynamic simulation.

Another way of assessing the performance of the model presents the counterfactual stocks of employment and unemployment during the recession. These are shown in Figures 24 and 25, where both stocks
are normalized by the population (so these are employment-population and unemployment-population
ratios). Here we see that all of the models trace out a path for employment that exceeds the observed
path, and a path for unemployment that falls short of what is actually observed. Part of this comes from
the fact that the model-based job finding rate was predicted to be slightly higher than what was actually
observed during the recession.
Figure 26 traces out the counterfactual Beveridge curve in unemployment using the full model with
duration dependence in all flows since the onset of the recession in October 2008. Also displayed is
the observed Beveridge Curve over this time period. We see that the model predictions trace out the
same general shape of the Beveridge curve, but we observe a difference (between predicted and actual
unemployment-population ratio) of around one-half to one percentage point over the recession. The fit
of the counterfactual N − V curve (see Figure 27) is not as good as the fit of the Beveridge curve in
unemployment in that the model persistently underestimates the share out of the labor force by about 1
percentage point.
Thus, we have so far seen that the dynamics of long-term joblessness conditional on unemployment
and non-participation are sensitive to correctly modeling the duration dependence in both job finding

matching the stocks of unemployed and non-participants over the recession.

6.4

A Canadian Great Recession in Labor Demand

The final question we want to take up using our full counterfactual model is whether the Canadian labor
market performed better than the U.S. labor market primarily because of differences in the demand
for labor over the recessionary period. Perhaps Canada avoided a Great Recession because Canadian
employers continued to create vacancies at higher rates and because Canadian employers did not lay-off
as many workers during the recession itself. To investigate this question, we take the counterfactual
model that we saw fits the data well over the recession and apply to it the same time series pattern in job
separation rates and in vacancies observed in the U.S. during the Great Recession. That is, we apply the
percentage decrease in vacancies observed during the Great Recession to the vacancy series in Canada
starting in October 2008 and we likewise apply the increase in the job loss rate over the Great Recession.
To illustrate, the vacancy rate in the U.S. in December 2008, one year after the onset of the Great
recession stood at 66 percent of the vacancy rate in December 2007. In our next set of counterfactual
simulations we thus postulate that the vacancy rate in Canada in October 2009 stands at 66 percent of
that in October 2008, the onset of the Canadian recession. At that point, the vacancy rate in Canada

41

had in fact only declined by about 19 percent. We proceed in the same fashion for job loss rates and thus
impose higher job losses on the Canadian economy.
The two panels in Figure 28 show the implied time series of the unemployment rate and nonparticipation rate from the full counterfactual model as well as the counterfactual model that does not
allow for duration dependence.18 We have highlight three results from this exercise. First, by coincidence
both of the counterfactual models closely approximate the observed patterns in the unemployment rate
in Canada. Second, even under the conditions of the Great Recession in terms of labor demand, the full
model and the model without any duration dependence do not diverge widely in predicted unemployment and non-participation over the recession. This reinforces the conclusion that duration dependence is
significantly more important for understanding the patterns in long-term joblessness than it is for understanding the overall performance of the labor market in terms of the broad labor force stocks (E, U, N ).
We believe this to be the case because these latter stocks and their dynamics are quite sensitive to the
flows early during jobless spells, since the majority of jobless spells are relatively short.
Third, the two panels in Figure 28 show that the much greater decline in labor demand and the larger
and more persistent increase in job loss rates in the U.S. compared to Canada is not enough to explain the
different labor market experiences of the two countries over the last decade. Clearly, imposing U.S.-style
deterioration in labor demand would have significantly worsened the recession in Canada, but it does
not seem as if this would have induced a Canadian Great Recession. Rather, it seems that the recession
in Canada was mild compared to the recession in the U.S. in large part because the rate at which job
seekers were matched to vacancies did not break down to the same extent in Canada as it did in the U.S.
In other words, the matching model was more stable in Canada during this time period.

Conclusion

Long-term unemployment rose sharply in both Canada and the U.S. during the Great Recession. The
levels of long-term unemployment continue to remain elevated in both countries and are not explained by
shifts in the observable characteristics of the unemployed. Similar to our previous analysis of the Great
Recession in the U.S., we turned to a matching model to try to understand these labor market dynamics.
The Canadian labor market data permitted us to extend the matching model in one important direction –
since we observe joblessness spells for both unemployed individuals and non-participants, we could model
how job finding rates vary with the duration of joblessness for both groups, something that we were unable
to do in the U.S. analysis. Additionally, we could allow for duration dependence in all flows between

“full” counterfactual model here includes duration dependence in both U and N.

unemployment and non-participation. Our results indicate that job finding rates for non-participants
are strongly negatively associated with the duration of joblessness. Flows between unemployment and
non-participants also depend significantly on the duration of joblessness. When we broaden the matching
model to include these features for Canada, we find that the fit of the model improves.
Our analysis suggests several important directions for future research. First, there are gaps in the
measurement framework of the BLS that should be addressed. Our paper and the work by Kudlyak and
Lange [2017] suggest that durations of joblessness and durations of unemployment are distinct economic
phenomena. Joblessness durations and unemployment durations do not measure the same thing and
researchers interpreting the duration of unemployment as the time since an unemployed individual was
last employed will be mistaken. Additionally, we demonstrate in this paper that accounting for joblessness durations among the unemployed and non-participants has important quantitative implications for
modeling the dynamics of the labor market. Thus, we believe that the CPS should consider following the
LFS in collecting data on time since last employment for both the unemployed and the non-employed.
Given rising interest in trends in labor force participation (see, e.g., Abraham and Kearney [2018]), this
seems like a worthwhile data investment. In the meantime, the panel nature of the CPS can serve to provide some information on the duration of joblessness that can be used to supplement the cross-sectional
measure of unemployment duration.
Second, our findings point to the importance of understanding flows between U and N , both overall
and by duration of joblessness. Only part of the newly unemployed are continuously actively searching for
employment and thus observed to be unemployed throughout their jobless spells. Many others move in
and out of the labor force and between non-participation and employment. When they become employed,
many are often in precarious jobs of short durations (see also Krueger et al. [2014] and Kudlyak and Lange
[2017]). One way to interpret this evidence is to postulate the existence of a dual labor market and to
think of part of the population as either being caught in – or choosing to engage in – a labor market with
short attachments and many transitions across unemployment, non-participation, and employment. This
suggests room for future work develoipng models that can capture this kind of labor market behavior.
Third, we hope other researchers will extend these results to more recent years and also apply them to
the study of future business cycles. Additionally, we have focused throughout our analysis on prime-age
workers (age 25-55). This excludes older workers, who are working longer in both Canada and the U.S.
One approach to include older workers would be to combine traditional matching models of the labor
market with traditional labor demand models that allow for imperfect substitution between older and
younger workers. This is the approach taken in Cosksun [2018], building on Card and Lemieux [2001],
and it may provide a useful template for studying a broader range of joblessness trends.
44

Fourth, in this paper we have applied the methodology of Landais et al. [2018] to calculate a new
vacancy series for Canada. This is a new measure that still needs more testing and validation, but we
believe it has promise. One important caveat is that this measure may capture variation in both “pure”
vacancies as well as variation in what Davis et al. [2013] describe as “recruiting intensity.” An interesting
avenue for future work is asssessing how much of the variation in the recruiting proxy captures each of
these distinct forces.
Fifth, we believe that a more geographically disaggregated analysis might provide useful insights. We
reported that the more severe contraction observed in the U.S. relative to the Canadian labor market
cannot be explained simply by the greater decline in labor demand or the more persistent degree of job
losses observed in the U.S. Rather, we found the matching model to be more stable in Canada than
the U.S. However, it is hard to know whether the severity of the recession itself might have lead the
matching function to break down or if something else caused this decline in the matching function. One
way to make progress would be to examine how the matching model did at a sub-national level, looking
across states, regions, or commuting zones. Do we observe that the matching model was particularly
unstable in those regions of the U.S. and Canada most severely hit by the recession? Similarly, “border
comparisons” focusing on areas on either side of the U.S.-Canada border might help control for differences
in the structures of the two national economies. Such regional analyses, however, are currently difficult
to carry out since vacancy measures are typically not available at the regional level. However, we believe
that regional analyses may be able to construct a recruiter-producer following Landais et al. [2018] ratio
at a sub-national level. This could allow researchers to construct “local Beveridge curves” and study
labor demand questions at a local level using this methodology to construct a proxy for local vacancies.
This paper provides some initial evidence that a matching framework provides a useful way to understand the performance of labor market in Canada in the recent past. It provides a parsimonious
framework, expanded in a transparent manner, to account for duration dependence in modeling flows
out of non-participation and unemployment as well as other forms of heterogeneity. Overall, we interpret
the results from this paper as providing suggestive evidence that joblessness may be a useful measure for
analyzing labor market trends.

where m denotes month; Y denotes unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, or employment
to population ration. Age is restricted to 25-55 or 25-65 years old.
We plot change of Y and contribution of aging for employment rate and labor force participation rate
in Figures 29 and 30. Contribution of age change is much smaller in the 25-55 years-old sample than in
the 25-65 years-old sample.
