ABSTRACT
Estimating the value of medical innovation is a continual challenge. In this research, we quantify
the impact of antihypertensive therapy on U.S. blood pressures, risk and number of heart attacks,
strokes, and deaths. We also consider the potential for further improvements. We estimate the
value of innovation using equations relating blood pressure to adverse outcomes from the
Framingham Heart Study. Our results show that without antihypertensive therapy, 1999-2000
average blood pressure for the U.S. population age 40 plus would have been 10-13 percent higher.
86,000 excess premature deaths from cardiovascular disease (2001), and 833,000 hospital discharges
for stroke and heart attacks (2002) would have occurred. Life expectancy would be 0.5 (men) and
0.4 (women) years lower. At guideline care, there would have been 89,000 fewer premature deaths
(2001) and 420,000 fewer hospital discharges for stroke and heart attack (2002) than observed. Our
analysis suggests that antihypertensive therapy has had a significant impact on cardiovascular health
outcomes but that mortality gains would have been approximately twice as high if guideline care had
been achieved for all.

Hypertension is an established risk factor for conditions including coronary heart
disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Over 50 million adults were
hypertensive in 1999-2000, including 43 percent of adults age 40 and over (i.e., had Stage
I or II blood pressures, or reported taking antihypertensive medicine). The risk of
developing hypertension increases with age; lifetime risk is estimated at approximately
90 percent for individuals with normal blood pressures at age 55 or 65 and who survive to
age 80 to 85.1 The economic burden of CHD and stroke is substantial. Applying the
methodologies of Rice et al. and Hodgson and Cohen to 2002 data, the total economic
burden of CHD and stroke is estimated at $120.6 and $48.9 billion, respectively.2,3
Drug therapy for hypertension has improved over the past four decades. Only
limited drug therapy existed in the late 1950s and early 1960s; the only FDA-approved
drug therapies for hypertension were vasodilators (approved in 1946), peripherally acting
agents (1953) and diuretics (1958).4 Most patients who would be treated immediately
today with effective drug therapy were untreated, or treated less effectively. For
example, while Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine (1962) found that diastolic
blood pressure was important in determining mortality, it justified treatment only in
properly selected cases, stating, “A woman who has tolerated her diastolic pressure of
120 for 10 years without symptoms or deterioration does not need specific treatment for
hypertension.”5 As late as 1971-75, only nine percent of the population age 40 and over
with hypertension reported in NHANES taking medication for it, and blood pressures
were poorly controlled; 79 percent of this treated group still had Stage I or II blood
pressures. Thus, the earlier time period could be called “drug-naïve” with regard to
widespread use of a range of effective drug therapies.

4

Over time, additional antihypertensive drugs became available – calcium channel
blockers and beta blockers (1970s and 1980s), and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin
receptor antagonists (1980s and 1990s). In 1999-2000, we calculate that 61 percent of
the population age 40 and over with hypertension reported in NHANES taking
medication.
Our objective is to estimate the actual impact of antihypertensive therapy on the
U.S. population over the past four decades and identify potential further improvements if
guideline care were achieved. Despite documented major strides in cardiovascular
disease management, there has been no systematic estimate of the total impact of
antihypertensive therapy on health outcomes. We use national survey data to estimate the
impact of drug treatment on average blood pressures, and the best-available published
risk equations to estimate the impact on the risk and number of MI, strokes, and deaths.
Because the objective is to estimate the “real world” impact of antihypertensive therapy
on outcomes for the entire population, representative national survey data were used,
rather than estimates derived from highly controlled clinical trials.

METHODS

Data Sources

We use data on 5,046 individuals age 30-79 from the 1959-62 National Health
Examination Survey (NHES) and 2,284 individuals age 40-79 from the 1999-2000
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); U.S. life expectancy
tables from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); hospital discharge figures
from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS); and published risk equations from
the Framingham Heart Study. All observations from NHES and NHANES populated
with the required data were included in calculations, which were performed using SAS,
release 9.1.

Statistical Analysis

Determinants of hypertension, including body mass index (BMI), diabetes, family
history, excessive alcohol use, high salt diet, exercise, race, age and sex were identified
from literature searches. Data on BMI, diabetes, race, age and sex were used to model
observed blood pressure among a drug-naïve sample (the 1959-62 NHES sample).
The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and these explanatory factors was
estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, with separate equations for
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and for men and women.

6

The explanatory variables are race (BLACK, OTHER, with white being the omitted
category), AGE (nine variables corresponding to five-year cohorts beginning with age 35,
age 30-34 being the omitted category), BMI, BMI2 (to account for possible nonlinearities in the effect of BMI on BP), and DIABETES (either reporting taking insulin or
having a blood glucose level>140 mg/dL) DIABETES, BMI, and BMI2 terms control for
the impact of secular population changes in the levels of diabetes and obesity.
To predict BP in the absence of antihypertensive drug therapy, the estimated
structural relationship based on data from 1959-62 is applied to observed values of the
explanatory variables for individuals in the 1999-2000 NHANES sample. Following
JNC-V definitions, predicted and observed systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BPs for
each individual are assigned to five categories: Optimal, Normal, High Normal, Stage I
and Stage II Hypertension.6 The resulting distribution of predicted BPs for 1999-2000 is
compared to the distribution of observed BPs. Controlling for other identified risk factors
for which data are available, the difference between the two distributions is attributed to
antihypertensive therapy. Two risk factors – sodium intake and exercise – could not be
included in the predictive model because data are available only for 1999-2000. A
sensitivity analysis of the impact of these variables on BP, using 1999-2000 data, was
conducted.
The impact of antihypertensive therapy on risk of death and total deaths from
CHD is estimated using Framingham Heart Study risk equations estimated by Wilson et
al.7, together with NCHS population life tables and cause of death statistics. The impact
of antihypertensive therapy on risk of stroke and MI, and hospital discharges for stroke

7

and MI is estimated using Framingham Heart Study risk equations estimated by
Anderson et al.8, and NHDS hospital discharge statistics.
The Wilson et al. risk equations are generated from a hazard model predicting the
probability of a CHD event (angina, MI, or death from CHD) within the next 10 years,
and include variables for age, total cholesterol, HDL-C, BP, diabetes and smoking.
These equations are applied to each individual in the NHANES sample based on the
individual’s observed characteristics. For each individual, the probability of a CHD
event within 10 years is calculated based on (1) observed BP and (2) predicted BP in the
absence of antihypertensive therapy, and a relative risk ratio calculated by dividing the
two. The calculated relative risks are averaged across individuals within each sex-age
cohort, according to sample population weights. Since the variable of interest is death
from major cardiovascular disease, average risks are combined with the probabilities for
men and women of a given age, n, surviving to age n+1 (from the NCHS life tables),9 and
with the share of deaths due to major cardiovascular disease (ICD/10 I00-I78) by sex-age
cohort (from NCHS cause of death tables by sex and age).10 By adjusting for the share of
total mortality due to death from major cardiovascular disease, increases in the risk of a
CHD event in the next 10 years are assumed to increase the risk of death from major
cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years proportionally. Improvement in life
expectancy attributable to antihypertensive therapy is calculated as the difference
between life expectancy at birth reported by NCHS (with observed BPs) and calculated
with predicted BPs. Predicted life expectancy is derived by adjusting the risk of death in
each year for men and women age 40 and above by the relative risk described for the
corresponding sex-age cohort, and summing over all ages.

8

The Anderson et al. risk equations are generated from separate parametric models
predicting the probability of stroke and MI for men and women of given characteristics
(age, BP, smoking, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C, diabetes and ECG-LVH) over the
next 4 to 12 years. The recommended specification incorporating SBP is used. For each
individual, the risk of stroke and MI, respectively, in the next five years is calculated
based on (1) observed BP and (2) predicted BP in the absence of antihypertensive
therapy, and a relative risk ratio calculated by dividing the two. The number of avoided
hospital discharges is calculated by applying the relative risk ratio to hospital discharge
statistics for stroke (ICD/9 430-438) and MI (ICD/9 410) by sex and age from the NHDS
for 2002. These risk equations allow us to isolate the effect of BP from other factors such
as secular changes in serum cholesterol levels, diabetes rates and smoking, which also
affect CHD risk.

RESULTS

Predictive Structural Model of Untreated Blood Pressure

OLS multivariate regression relating SBP and DBP to risk factors was used with a sample
of 2,382 men and 2,664 women age 30-79 from the 1959-62 NHES. Results appear in
Table 1.

Table 1

Figure 1 is derived by applying the structural relationship from the untreated BP
model for men and women, respectively, to observed characteristics of individuals in the
1999-2000 NHANES sample. The predicted SBPs and DBPs without antihypertensive
drug therapy and observed BPs for each individual are assigned to five categories:
Optimal, Normal, High Normal, Stage I and Stage II Hypertension. If an individual’s
predicted systolic and diastolic BPs are in different categories, the more hypertensive
category is assigned.

Figure 1

For example, observed BPs for men age 40-49, treated or not, were: 36 percent
Optimal, 26 percent Normal, 21 percent High Normal, 14 percent Stage I and 3 percent
Stage II Hypertensive. For the same cohort, predicted BPs without treatment were: 22

10

percent Optimal, 22 percent Normal, 19 percent High Normal, 27 percent Stage I and 10
percent Stage II Hypertensive.
Calculating weighted average BPs for each sample, we find that in the absence of
antihypertensive drug therapy, average BPs for the population over 40 would be 10-13
percent higher (10.0 to 10.7 percent for men and 10.4 to 12.9 percent for women for SBP
and DBP, respectively). Women age 70-79 exhibited the greatest difference between
predicted and observed BPs, with 61 percent predicted and 29 percent observed with
Stage II hypertension, compared to 41 and 12 percent, respectively, for men age 70-79.
However, these women also experienced rates of Stage II hypertension 2.5 times higher
than their male counterparts.

Statistical Sensitivity Analyses

To allow for nonlinearities, the continuous BMI variables in the BP prediction equation
were replaced by six categories from the literature: “less than or within normal BMI
range”, “marginally overweight”, “overweight”, “very overweight”, “severely obese”,
and “morbidly/super obese”.11 The relationship between BP and BMI is linear for
women and weakly concave for men.
Variables measuring reported sodium intake and exercise habits (available only
for 1999-2000) were also included in the model. Both have been identified as
hypertension risk factors in the literature. Neither increased the explanatory power of the
model significantly; the predicted BP distributions were nearly identical with or without
these variables. Variables for sodium intake were never statistically significant and often

11

had incorrect signs, while the exercise variable was occasionally significant. They had
no significant impact on BMI or BMI2coefficients, and increased the R2 measure only at
the third decimal point. To assess possible non-normality in the model’s error terms, a
log-transformation of the dependent variable was regressed on the same variables. This
specification did not increase the model’s explanatory power nor the precision of the
estimated coefficients significantly.

Impact of Blood Pressure on Life Expectancy and Total Deaths from Major
Cardiovascular Disease

Applying the Wilson et al. risk equation for CHD events within the next 10 years to each
individual in the 1999-2000 sample, and averaging the effect over the entire population,
the total increase in life expectancy associated with antihypertensive drug therapy is 0.5
years (men) 0.4 years (women). Averaged over only the population with predicted Stage
I or Stage II hypertension, the values are 0.9 years (men) and 0.6 years (women).
Applying the change in risk of death to total deaths for each sex-age cohort, an estimated
86,000 excess premature deaths from cardiovascular disease (50,000 men, 36,000
women) would have occurred in 2001 among the U.S. population age 40 plus in the
absence of antihypertensive drug therapy. For adults age 40 plus, observed 2001 total
deaths and deaths from major cardiovascular disease are four and nine percent lower,
respectively, than predicted levels with untreated BPs. Due to potential competitive
mortality, these estimates represent reductions in premature deaths due to cardiovascular
disease; reductions in total mortality from all causes in a given year may be lower.

12

If all patients with Stage I or Stage II hypertension who reported being untreated
had been treated, as recommended in JNC 712(p 1211), and all treated patients achieved
normal BPs, we calculate an additional 89,000 fewer premature deaths from major
cardiovascular disease in 2001 than actually occurred. This is likely an underestimate
because it assumes that those dying are no more likely to have high BP than the general
population.

Impact of Blood Pressure on MI and Stroke

Similarly, for each individual in the NHANES 1999-2000 sample, we calculate the
separate risks of stroke or MI within the next five years, applying the Anderson et al.
equations. In the absence of antihypertensive drug therapy, there would have been
572,000 more hospital discharges for stroke in 2002 (162,000 men, 410,000 women), and
261,000 more discharges for MI (87,000 men, 174,000 women). This is a 38 percent
reduction in discharges for stroke and a 25 percent reduction for MI, compared to
predictions with untreated BPs. Most of this improvement represents stroke and MI
avoided altogether, rather than delayed. Even if all the predicted reduction in discharges
were for patients with predicted Stage II hypertension (those most likely to have a stroke
in the future), we calculate only seven percent of discharges for stroke and five percent
for MI would have occurred in the future; the remainder were avoided altogether.
We also calculate considerable improvements if guideline care were achieved. If
all untreated patients with Stage I or Stage II hypertension had been treated, and all
treated patients achieved normal BPs, there would have been an additional 278,000

13

(stroke) and 142,000 (MI) fewer hospital discharges in 2002 than actually occurred. This
is likely an underestimate because it assumes that those discharged for stroke and MI are
no more likely to have high BP than the general population.

DISCUSSION

By many measures, hypertension is much better treated now than in the past.
Although further efforts are still needed to bring health benefits to all, awareness,
treatment, and control of hypertension have shown considerable improvement since
NHANES II (1976-80)12(p 1207). The estimated impact of antihypertensive therapy on BP
is substantial: approximately 10 percent (SBP) and 13 percent (DBP) for both men and
women age 40 plus, compared to predicted untreated BP. Better-controlled BP translated
into nine percent fewer deaths from major cardiovascular disease in 2001, and 38 percent
and 25 percent fewer hospital discharges for stroke and MI in 2002, respectively,
compared to predicted levels in the absence of drug therapy. Placing the estimated
reduction of approximately 86,000 deaths in context, U.S. deaths from motor vehicle
accidents totaled approximately 42,000 in 2001.13

Figure 2
This study quantifies the impact of antihypertensive drugs in terms of avoided
premature deaths from cardiovascular disease and excess hospitalizations for stroke and
MI. Assigning a monetary value to these outcomes and drawing on figures from the
literature for 1998, we calculate a benefit-cost ratio of over 12:1 for men and 11:1 for
women by comparing life expectancy benefits to antihypertensive drug expenditures. We
assume each year of additional life in good health is valued at $90,000 (a generally
accepted value of $100,000, less $10,000 in average support costs during non-working
years paid by government),14 and expenditures on antihypertensive drugs average $2,600

15

for men (over a 73.8-year expected lifespan) and $3,248 for women (over a 79.5-year
expected lifespan).15 We discount both costs and benefits at three percent a year, the
inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury bond yield.
Previous studies have concluded that antihypertensive treatment is cost-effective;
Weinstein reports estimates of the number of quality-adjusted life years achieved with
each $1 million spent on antihypertensive drug therapy as between 20-50
(antihypertensive treatment, DBP 95-104) to more than 200 (beta-blockade postmyocardial infarction, high risk). As a benchmark, $1 million spent for dialysis for endstage renal disease is estimated to yield 10-20 quality-adjusted life years.16
Reduced hospitalizations for stroke and MI increase calculated net benefits
further. Dividing figures from the literature for total hospital costs for CHD and
cerebrovascular disease17, 18 by corresponding hospital discharges, and assuming hospital
costs represent 70 percent of direct medical costs in the year following stroke and MI,19
we estimate 2002 total direct medical costs avoided due to fewer strokes and MI of $10.7
billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. Including the impact of antihypertensive drugs on
quality of life and work productivity would increase the benefit–cost ratio further.
While the benefits have been substantial, significant opportunities remain to
extend drug treatment to more who could benefit. We estimate life expectancy could
increase an additional 0.3 years (men) and 0.1 years (women) if therapy were extended to
all with Stage I or Stage II hypertension not currently treated with medication, and an
additional 0.2 years for both men and women if those treated achieved normal BP. These
figures translate into an additional 89,000 avoided premature deaths from major

16

cardiovascular disease, and an additional 278,000 (stroke) and 142,000 (MI) avoided
hospital discharges, compared with actual 2002 levels.

Study Limitations

The methodology used is a residual analysis. It controls for all risk factors for which data
are available, and confirms that omitted sodium and exercise variables are unlikely to
have a significant impact. There remains, however, the possibility that unknown factors
may have contributed to differences between observed and predicted BPs. In particular,
some researchers suggest a downward cohort effect due to unknown, population-level
factors. Using the same datasets, Goff et al. find that the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile
levels of observed BP by age were lower for more recent birth cohorts. However,
because observed BPs include both treated and untreated BPs, the observed cohort effect
is confounded by the impact of treatment. Even in lowest-decile SBPs, where
“pharmacologic management is unlikely to have had any impact,”20 1999-2000 NHANES
data show nine percent age 40 plus reported taking hypertension medication (increasing
to 29 percent age 60 plus). We adjust for this confounding treatment effect by calculating
the ratio of untreated to all lowest-decile SBPs in the 1999-2000 sample (by age), and
adjusting the authors’ estimates thereby. Assuming the improvement in the lowest decile,
as adjusted, to be entirely due to a cohort effect would reduce our estimate of the impact
of BP improvements modestly, from a nine- to an eight-percent reduction in 2001
premature deaths from cardiovascular disease.

17

Our calculations assume the 1959-62 data provide a reliable predictive basis for
calculating the structural relationship between BP and explanatory variables, notably
BMI and BMI2, and that the sample is “drug-naïve.” While NHANES data are available
for subsequent time periods (1971-75, 1976-80, 1988-94, and 1999-2000), their
suitability for estimating this relationship is compromised by the increasing proportion
being treated with antihypertensive drugs, thereby rendering the remaining untreated
population increasingly unrepresentative. When similar equations are estimated in later
years with only the remaining untreated individuals, the predicted impact of a change in
BMI (and BMI2) on BP was always positive, but generally became smaller over time,
consistent with an increasingly selective untreated population. While treatment rates
were low in 1959-62 and few effective clinical options were available, to the degree that
some individuals were treated effectively, predicted untreated BPs for 1999-2000, and
therefore the estimated impact of treatment on mortality and morbidity, would be
understated. The study design may also overestimate strokes and MI avoided due to a
“survival bias”; specifically, in the absence of effective BP control, the total population
with hypertension would have been smaller and some individuals who had a stroke or MI
in 2002 would have died previously. However, there is a likely countervailing
underestimation effect, in that those discharged for stroke and MI are assumed to be no
more likely to have high BP than the general population. The net impact of these effects
is unknown.
Finally, the study design relies on Framingham Heart Study risk equations. To
the degree that these equations were estimated on an essentially all-white population, and
that cardiovascular risk for the same level of BP may be higher for non-white

18

populations, all other factors held constant, we have underestimated the impact of
treatment.
