What Really Happened to Consumption Inequality in the US?
Orazio Attanasio, Erich Battistin, and Hidehiko Ichimura
NBER Working Paper No. 10338
March 2004
JEL No. E21, E26
ABSTRACT
This paper considers data quality issues for the analysis of consumption inequality exploiting two
complementary datasets from the Consumer Expenditure Survey for the United States. The
Interview sample follows survey households over four calendar quarters and consists of
retrospectively collected information about monthly expenditures on durable and non-durable goods.
The Diary sample interviews household for two consecutive weeks and includes detailed
information about frequently purchased items (food, personal cares and household supplies). Most
reliable information from each sample is exploited to derive a correction for the measurement error
affecting observed measures of consumption inequality in the two surveys. We find that
consumption inequality, as measured by the standard deviation of log non-durable consumption, has
increased by roughly 5% points during the 1990s.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of inequality over the 1980s and 1990s has received an enormous amount of
attention and a voluminous literature studies it. However, most of the existing studies consider
either inequality in wages (hourly earnings) or incomes. These studies have documented a very
large increase during the 1980s, especially during the first half of that decade, followed by some
more moderate increases during the last part of the 1980s and the 1990s.
Several dimensions of the evolution of inequality have been extensively studied. In particular, many researchers have tried to decompose the observed increase in inequality into increases
in inequality between well defined groups (for instance, based on educational attainment) and
within groups. Others have focused instead on the decomposition of the increase in inequality between increases in the variance of permanent components of wages and earnings and
transitory components.
Very few studies have considered the evolution of inequality in consumption. This is partly
due to the paucity of data sources containing individual level consumption data. One of the
first papers to use the Consumer Expenditure Survey in the US (CEX in the following) to study
the evolution of consumption inequality is Cutler and Katz (1991), documenting an increase in
consumption inequality that substantially paralleled the increase in wage and income inequality.
Slesnick (1993), on the other hand, analyzes the evolution of poverty in the US and stresses that
the picture that emerges when one uses consumption instead of income to measure poverty,
is very different, both in terms of levels and of dynamics. Attanasio and Davis (1996) focus
on differences across education and year of birth cohorts and report that, coherently with the
Cutler and Katz (1991) evidence, especially at relatively low frequencies, relative wage changes
are pretty much reflected in relative consumption changes. Slesnick (2001), instead, claims that

3

the evolution of consumption inequality is in sharp contrast to that of income inequality: ”...the
widely reported U-turn in inequality in the United States is an artifact of the inappropriate
use of family income as a measure of welfare. When well-being is defined to be a function of
per equivalent consumption, inequality either decreased over the sample or remained essentially
unchanged depending on the choice of equivalence scale” (p.154).
More recently, Krueger and Perri (2003) discuss results based on the analysis of the CEX
until 2001 that are roughly consistent with those reported by Slesnick (2001). In particular,
Krueger and Perri (2003) stress that after a modest increase during the first part of the 1980s,
consumption inequality is substantially flat. Attanasio (2003) and Battistin (2003), on the
other hand, present evidence, based on both the Interview and the Diary segments of the CEX
that seems to contradict such a view. Blundell, Pistaferri and Preston (2002) use the PSID
until 1992 and show that the inequality of food consumption is increasing in that dataset.
A fair conclusion that can be drawn from the few studies above is that the evidence on
the evolution of consumption inequality in the US is far from clearcut and that there is not
much agreement in the literature. This state of affairs is particularly unsatisfying because measures of consumption inequality and their evolution can be particularly useful and informative.
As Blundell and Preston (1998) stress, under certain condition, consumption comparison can
be more informative about welfare differences than income comparisons. Well-being is determined by consumption rather than income. Consumption changes will take into account any
mechanism that individual households have to buffer income shocks (either because they are
transitory or because they are somehow insured).
Deaton and Paxson (1994) spell out some of the implications of the life cycle model for
the evolution of the cross sectional variance of consumption inequality. Blundell and Preston

4

(1998) show how to use information on the evolution of income and consumption inequality
and some of the insights from the permanent income model to decompose changes in income
variances in changes in the variances of transitory and permanent components. An approach
complementary to Blundell and Preston (1998) is that of Attanasio and Davis (1996) who frame
their evidence in terms of a test of consumption insurance, along the lines proposed by Cochrane
(1991), Mace (1991) and Townsend (1994). Essentially, what Attanasio and Davis (1996) label
‘uninsured relative wage changes’ is closely related to Blundell and Preston ‘permanent’ shocks,
which cannot be self-insured within a life cycle model.
The current lack of consensus and even the small number of studies that have analyzed in
detail consumption inequality are related to the nature of the individual level data currently
available on consumption expenditure. The CEX is a relatively small survey, collected mainly
to compute weights of the CPI, rather then studying consumption inequality. Moreover, the
survey is affected by other problems. There is now substantial evidence that by aggregating
CEX data it is not easy to obtain figures corresponding closely to figures from National Income
and Product Accounts (NIPA) Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, for many commodities (see McCarthy et al., 2002). While the differences between CEX and NIPA-PCE data
can partly be explained by definitional and coverage differences and it does not necessarily arise
from problems with the CEX (see, for instance, Slesnick 1992), the amount by which the CEX
underestimates national aggregates is massive (around 35%) and compares badly with other
surveys such as the Family Expenditure Survey for the United Kingdom. Moreover, the relationship between the aggregated CEX and NIPA-PCE data has worsened considerably during
the second part of the 1990s (see for example Battistin, 2003).
The main goal of the CEX (that is the computation of CPI weights) is reflected in the

5

existence of two completely separate surveys, one based on retrospective interviews (Interview
Sample, IS in the following) and one based on weekly diaries (Diary Sample, DS). The idea
is that some expenditure items (such as large, infrequent items) are better measured by retrospective interviews, while others (such as frequently purchased and small items) are better
measured by diaries.
Indeed, until 1986, the DS only collected information on frequently purchased items. Since
1986, both surveys are in principle exhaustive, but it is quite clear from the BLS literature and
from informal communications, that some items are reliably measured in the IS and others in
the DS. This data structure does not constitute an important problem if one is only interested
in means, but it creates a problem if one needs information on total consumption expenditure
for a given household, as it is the case if one wants to study consumption inequality across
households. Of course, in the absence of reliable data on total consumption for a given household
that would allow to study inequality at the individual level, one could focus on differences in
mean consumption across well defined groups of households. But such an approach would miss
an important dimension of inequality, that is within group inequality.
One of the most puzzling results that arises from the analysis of CEX consumption inequality
data is that the evolution over time of consumption inequality as measured in the IS and DS
is very different (see Attanasio, 2003, and Battistin, 2003). In Figure 1, we plot the standard
deviation of log of per-adult equivalent non-durable consumption from 1982 to 2001 for IS
and DS data (diary information is only after 1986). The figures are based on all households
headed by an individual aged 25 to 60. The difference is remarkable: the DS plot shows a
substantial increase, amounting to around 10 percentage points between 1986 and 2001. The
IS plot, on the other hand, shows a path that is substantially flat. As the IS shows an increase

Figure 1: Standard deviation of log per capita monthly expenditure
in the variance across education groups (see Attanasio and Davis, 1996 and Attanasio, 2003),
a constant overall inequality also constitutes indirect evidence of a decline in inequality within
groups.1 Regressing the two lines on a constant and a linear time trend, one obtains (after
1986) a trend coefficient of 0.04 for the IS and of 0.64 for the DS with a t statistic of 1.17 and
12.66, respectively. The correlation between the residuals of the two regressions is 0.26.
This evidence is particularly puzzling because the differences in mean non-durable consumption between the two surveys is relatively stable over time (as we show in Section 3).2
Moreover, in many other dimensions the CEX offers a picture of inequality that is remarkably
consistent with that obtained from other (extensively explored) datasets. In what follows we
provide some evidence in this respect.
The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we provide additional information on the dynamics
of inequality of consumption and its components in the two CEX surveys and relate it to the
1

This follows since V ar(y) = V ar(E[y|z]) + E[V ar(y|z)], where groups are denoted by z.
Attanasio (2003), however, shows that if one conditions on cohorts defined from education and year of
birth, the differences in the dynamics of inequality between the two surveys is not as remarkable as in Figure 1.
Whether this is genuinely due to conditioning or to the small sample sizes in the DS once one crosses education
and year of birth cohort is, however, debatable.

dynamics of wage inequality, as measured both in the CEX and the Current Population Survey.
Second, we use the information that some items are better measured in the DS and others in the
IS and some assumptions on the nature of measurement error in the two surveys, to construct
an unified picture of the dynamics of consumption inequality in the US between 1986 and 2001
(and particularly for the 1990s).
The fact that some items are better measured in one survey than in the other implies
that consistent means for total (non-durable) consumption can easily be obtained for any
consistently defined group of consumers combining the two surveys. However, to get an estimate
of inequality (say the standard deviation of log consumption or the coefficient of variation of
consumption) one needs to deal with the covariance between different consumption items that
are well-measured in different surveys. One can make use of the measurement-error ridden
measure in both surveys and, under some assumptions we discuss in Section 4, obtain point
estimates of the growth of the coefficient of variation of non-durable consumption.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the CEX and its
components. We describe in detail the nature of the information on consumption available in
the DS and the IS, as well as the sample we select for the rest of our analysis. In Section 3
we discuss the evolution of average consumption over time in the two surveys. We also report
some evidence on comparing the pattern of wage inequality in the CEX and in the Current
Population Survey that, complementing that in Attanasio (2003), shows that the two surveys
tell similar stories in this dimension. Finally, in this section, we also discuss the puzzle presented
in Figure 1. In particular, we consider and dismiss a few simple explanations for the divergence
in inequality between the two surveys. In Section 4, we write down the basic relationships and
assumptions we use to obtain an estimate of the variance of consumption by combining the two

8

surveys we have. In Section 5 we present the results we obtain using such an approach. Section
6 concludes.

THE CEX SURVEYS

The CEX is currently the only micro-level data set reporting comprehensive measures of consumption expenditures for a large cross-section of households in the US. The CEX has a long
history: the first survey was collected in 1916-1917. More recently, the CEX was collected in
1960-1961 and 1972-1973. As the main scope of the survey is to compute weights for the CPI,
data were collected roughly every ten years. As a consequence, the survey methodology and
the questionnaires are not homogeneous across the early surveys and this makes inter-temporal
comparisons difficult. However, in 1980 it was decided to collect data on a continuous basis
with a methodology that was roughly consistent over time. Since then, and especially after
1982, the instruments changed only marginally and in very few occasions. Therefore, with
some important caveats (see the discussion in Battistin, 2003) it is conceivable to use the time
series of cross sections since 1982 for inter-temporal comparisons.
As we mentioned above, the CEX consists of two separate surveys, the Interview Survey
(IS) and the Diary Survey (DS). In this section, we summarize the main features of these two
components. In particular, Section 2.1 describes the IS and the DS questionnaires. Section 2.2
discusses the extent to which the IS and the DS are comparable with respect to sample designs,
population coverage and information collected. In the same subsection we also discuss the
definition of household total consumption we use in the analysis. Finally, Section 2.3 presents
some evidence on the sample we use in this paper. The reader interested in more specific details
on the survey methodology in the CEX is referred to Battistin (2003) and Bureau of Labor
Statistics (2003).

2.1

Diary and Interview Samples

In the CEX, sample consumer units are households (literally, “all members of a particular housing unit who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, or some other legal arrangement”; see
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2003). The survey consists of two separate and independent samples
of households, each of them with its own questionnaire. The IS is a rotating panel including
5000 units each quarter. The DS consists of repeated cross sections of households (around
4500 per year) interviewed over a two-week period. Response rates for the two components are
reasonably good (around 80 percent). Starting in 1999, the sample size has increased by about
40%. More detailed characteristics of the two surveys are discussed extensively in Battistin
(2003).
In the IS, households are interviewed about their expenditures every three months over
five consecutive quarters. The first interview, however, is a contact interview on which there
is no information in the public database. After the last interview households are dropped
and replaced by a new unit, so that - by design - 20 percent of the sample is replaced out
every quarter. Only one person responds for the whole consumer unit, typically the most
knowledgeable of expenditures in the family. The percentage of households completing all five
interviews is about 75 percent.
In the DS, consumer units are asked to self-report their daily purchases over two consecutive
one-week periods using product-oriented diaries. Each diary is organized by day of purchase
and by broad classifications of goods and services. Respondents are assisted by printed cues and
- whether it is needed - by interviewers at pick-up. The percentage of households completing
both diaries is about 92 percent.
Crucial to our exercise is that the two samples drawn are random and representative of the

10

same population. The two survey components are in fact based on a common sampling frame:
the 1980 Census for those households sampled in the 1980s and the 1990 Census for households
sampled in the 1990s. Sample designs differ only in terms of frequency and over sampling of
DS households during the peak shopping period of Christmas and New Year holidays.

2.2

The information collected in the CEX

In this paper, we use twenty years of data from both surveys of the CEX between 1982 and
2001. From 1980 to 1985 the DS only collected information on frequently purchased items,
while it became comprehensive in 1986. Because of this our analysis will focus especially on
the 1986-2001 period.
Both the DS and the IS collect detailed information on individual commodities, identified
by several hundreds of Universal Classification Codes (UCC). The information on frequently
purchased items, and especially food items, is much more detailed in the DS. In the IS food is
made only of two large components: food at home and food away from home. We perform a
first level of aggregation on both surveys. This aggregation is mainly dictated by the categories
that form the CPI defined by the BLS. We further aggregate these categories into non-durable
consumption and other consumption expenditure.
Throughout the analysis we will be focusing on the expenditure on non-durable goods and
services. The expenditure categories considered have been defined so that definitions are comparable and consistent over time and across surveys (see Battistin, 2003). Expenditure on
non-durables is defined according to the definition in Attanasio and Weber (1995): food and
non-alcoholic beverages (both at home and away from home), alcoholic beverages, tobacco and
expenditures on other non-durable goods such as heating fuel, public and private transports
(including gasoline), services and semi-durables (defined by clothing and footwear). The cate-

gories included in our definition of non-durable consumption are listed in Table 1. We consider
nine expenditure categories, corresponding to roughly 280 and 400 UCC for IS and DS data,
respectively.3
Whilst the bulk of the questionnaires and survey methodology were remarkably stable over
time, some minor changes did occur. New diaries with more cues were introduced in the DS
after 1991; for the IS, the food question changed in 1982 and 1987. Some UCC have changed,
mainly reflecting the diffusion of new goods,4 but our aggregates are not affected substantially
3

As we mentioned above, expenditures referring to “Housing and Public Services” and “Non-durable Services” have been introduced in the DS only after 1986, with the exception of very few items for “Home Maintenance Services” and “Non-durable Entertainment Expenses”. Similarly, information on “Fuel” and “Transportation” expenses is not available from public tapes between 1982 and 1985. As for IS data, the time series of
food at home expenditure presents discontinuities introduced by changes in survey design in 1982 and 1987 (see
Battistin, 2003). A detailed description of the items used to define the categories of non-durable consumption
can be downloaded at http://www.stat.unipd.it/∼erich/papers.html, separately for IS and DS data.

For instance, the UCC corresponding to expenditure on personal computers was divided into two UCC
relating to software and hardware.

12

by these changes. Battistin (2003) maps UCC into the nine categories in Table 1 accounting
for these changes.
Both surveys are almost exhaustive. This implies that, for most items, we have a measure
both for the households in the DS and for those in the IS. The only exception for the definition
of consumption considered in our analysis is given by some small items (mainly housekeeping
services and personal care - these categories are reported in italic in Table 1 in the “Non-Durable
Goods and Services” category) for which information is collected in the DS, but not in the IS.
We discuss how we tackle this problem below.
We exclude from our definition of consumption expenditures on durables, health, education
as well as mortgage and rent payments. The main reason to exclude expenditure on durables is
that it is not directly linked to consumption. One would like to measure the services provided
by the existing stock of durables, rather than the increase in the stock of durables. Similarly,
education and health expenditure obviously have an important investment component. Moreover, in the case of health, the CEX only measures out-of-pocket expenditures. Finally, we
excluded rent because we do not have a reliable measure of rental equivalent for home owners
and mortgage payments because they are not directly related to the consumption of housing
services. Whilst all the exercises for which we report results use the expenditure on non-durable
and services as our definition of consumption, we also performed some experiments with total
consumption, as defined by the BLS. The results we obtained in these cases were substantially
similar to those we report.
To estimate average consumption, the BLS follows the standard international procedure
of exploiting information from recall questions for more durable and less frequently purchased
items bought in the quarter prior to the interview. Diary-based records of purchases carried out

13

within a two-week period are used for more frequently purchased items such as food. According
to Bureau of Labor Statistics (2003), neither survey is expected to measure accurately all
components of consumption. In what follow, we label the commodities that the BLS thinks are
better measured in the DS as D goods and services, and those that are better measured in the
IS as R goods and services. In Table 2 we list which categories belong to the D and R groups
according to the BLS.5

2.3

The selected sample

In this analysis, we focus on households headed by individuals aged at least 25 and no more
than 60 and not self-employed. The family head is conventionally fixed to be the male in all
husband/wife families (representing the 56% and 53% of the whole sample for IS and DS data,
respectively). Battistin (2003) presents a detailed description of less important selection criteria
used to derive the working sample considered in the analysis.
Although the two surveys are designed to be representative of the same population, there are
5

It is worth noting that, although the level of aggregation considered by the BLS is finer, the classification
procedure exploited in what follows broadly reflects the one currently being used in the publication of CEX
data. See also the discussion in Battistin (2003), where evidence on the validity of this classification is produced
with respect to other expenditure surveys in the world.

significant differences between the two samples along several dimensions and with a different
pattern over time (even using the population weights provided by the BLS). To control for
observed compositional differences between the two samples (for instance the DS is slightly
more educated than the IS sample), Battistin (2003) weights DS households with the inverse
of the probability of being in the IS sample, estimated as a function of characteristics common
across the two samples (propensity score weighting; see Battistin et al., 2003, and Hirano et
al., 2003).
The specification adopted (see Table 1 in Battistin, 2003) includes education, race, age
and work-related information of the head, as well as information on household composition
(proportion of children and members within certain age bands) and family income. These
variables have proved relevant to data quality in previous analysis of CEX data (see Tucker,
1992). We use the same procedure here. However, results obtained using BLS population
weights or propensity score weights are basically identical. Table 3 reports, for each year, the
size of the sample we end up with for the two surveys. As it is obvious from the table, sample
sizes are not huge, particularly for the DS sample. This represents a real problem if one wants to
control for several observable characteristics, such as year of birth and education. The increase
in sample size in 1999 we mentioned above is evident in this table.
Monthly expenditure in the DS is defined as 26/12 = 2.16 times the expenditure observed
over two weeks, assuming equally complete reporting. Family consumption is adjusted using the
OECD adult equivalence scale, which gives each adult beyond the first a weight of 0.7 and each
child (under 18) a weight of 0.5. While such an adult equivalence scale is clearly arbitrary, the
results we obtain are only minimally affected by the consideration of alternative scales.6 Real

In previous versions we have reported results based on different adult equivalence scales. The choice of the
scale, changes the results very little.

expenditures are obtained using the Current Price Index published by the BLS. Consumption
data are also corrected for seasonality, using a simple seasonality model estimated on the whole
dataset.
Both surveys collect information on a very large set of household characteristics (demographics and work-related variables) as well as on income and assets (using a twelve-month
recall period). The latter information is subject to top-coding in both components of the CEX
and known to be not as reliable as the expenditure information: the amount of incomplete
income reporters is about 13 percent in the two surveys and missing values are currently not
imputed (see McCarthy et al., 2002). Since the percentage of incomplete income reporters is
so high, we included all of them in the final sample. In our robustness analysis we checked
whether the exclusion of households with incomplete income responses makes any difference to
our main results.

EVIDENCE ON CONSUMPTION AND WAGES

In this section we present three sets of results. First, we compare expenditure means from
the two CEX surveys to aggregate values from national accounts data. We find important
differences between IS and DS figures and, crucially, in the ratio of CEX to NIPA figures over
time. Second we present some data on the evolution of wage inequality exploiting CEX and
Current Population Survey. This evidence shows that the overall picture painted in the two
surveys is essentially the same. Finally, we present some additional information on the evolution
of consumption inequality from the two survey components of the CEX.

Consumption means

In Figure 2, we compare total non-durable expenditure in published CEX tables to the figures
one obtain for a similar category in the NIPA accounts for PCE.7 The CEX aggregates are computed using the population weights provided by the BLS and using published information from
both the DS and the IS. Two elements are worth stressing from this picture. First, even though
there are some important definitional differences, discussed extensively by Slesnick (1992, 2001)
amongst others, one can not help noticing that the CEX figure massively understates the one
from PCE data. While this does not necessarily mean that for every single consumption item
the PCE provides superior information (see for instance the discussion in McCarthy et al.,
2002), this evidence contrasts sharply with similar comparisons for the UK, where aggregating a time series of individual cross sectional data, one obtains close to 95% of non-durable

We are grateful to David Johnson at the BLS for making this graph available to us. Non-durables includes
food at home, food away, alcohol, apparel and services, maintenance and repairs, utilities, household operations, housekeeping supplies, gasoline and motor fuel, vehicle maintenance, vehicle rental and other, public
transportation, fees and admissions, other entertainment supplies, personal care, tobacco. The contents of this
figure are comparable to those of Figure 3.2 in Slesnick (2001; page 51), although the latter figure looks at total
expenditure on durable and non-durable goods.

consumption, as documented in Banks and Johnson (1998). Second, while the divergence between CEX and PCE is roughly constant in the first part of the sample, the difference seems
to increase in the second part of the 1990s. This evidence is consistent with that reported by
other researchers including Slesnick (1992), Sabelhaus (1996), Slesnick (2001) and several BLS
internal publications.
As we are interested in combining the information from the IS and the DS, it might be
interesting to compare the estimates of aggregate non-durable consumption that emerge from
the two surveys. In Figure 3, we plot the time series of average log non-durable consumption
computed in the two datasets. While average consumption is consistently higher in the the IS
than in the DS, we also notice that the relative difference between the two surveys is roughly
constant over time and in particular after 1991.8
In Figure 4, we plot the time series of the average level (rather than log) of monthly nondurable consumption from the two data sets. The two series are very different in the first part
of the sample, but they converge remarkably starting in 1991. Of course Figure 1, where we
plotted the standard deviation of log consumption, and Figures 3 and 4, that plot the average
level and log consumption, are not independent: under the assumption of log-normality, one
would be able to derive any one from the other two figures. We can summarize the evidence
from these pictures by saying that, especially from 1991, the average log and level consumption
estimated from the two surveys move very closely to each other, while the standard deviation
diverges considerably.
8
This hypothesis can be tested statistically and can not be rejected at standard significance levels. Battistin
(2003) finds that the relationship between mean expenditures in the two surveys varies a great deal considering
a similar analysis by expenditure group.

3.2

Wage inequality in the CEX and in the CPS

There is a widespread perception that income figures in the CEX are not particularly reliable,
especially relative to other more established and better explored data sets, such as the Current
Population Survey (CPS). Before starting with the analysis of consumption inequality, it is
therefore worth reporting some information on how the CEX performs in measuring the level
and inequality of wages (hourly earnings) over time relative to the CPS, which has been widely
used in the study of wage inequality.
From one of the supplementary CEX files it is possible to obtain measures of earnings
and hours worked for each household member. We compare the figures we obtain using these
measures to analogous measures obtained from rotating CPS files.9 Using this information, we
compute the average and the standard deviation of log male hourly earnings in both datasets
for the 20 years from 1982 to 2001. We perform the exercise both for the whole sample and for
cohort/educational attainment groups.
Top-coding levels are different in the two datasets and have changed over time. In both
data sets, we compute the mean and standard deviation of each cell by fitting (in each cell)
a log normal distribution truncated at the top-coding level. This procedure assumes that the
log-normal distribution fits reasonably well the distribution of wages even for the top few percents that are top-coded. This type of correction is particularly important for comparisons over
time as top-coding levels change.
We start by computing the mean and standard deviation of log hourly male earnings in the
IS and in the CPS for all males living in urban areas aged between 25 and 60. If we correlate
9

The CPS is not exempted from problems. There are several changes, both in terms of definitions of various
variables (such as relation to the household head) and in top-coding levels. We have used the NBER extracts
and suggestions to correct for changes in definitions and variable labels over time. We discuss what we do for
top-coding below. We thank David Card for providing us with the data for 2000 and 2001 and for some useful
suggestions.

the averages, we obtain a correlation coefficient of 0.62. Regressing the IS average on the CPS
average, we obtain a coefficient of 0.83 (s.e.= 0.26), a constant not statistically different from
zero and an R-squared of 38%.
Correlating the standard deviation of log wages we obtain a coefficient of 0.5. A regression of
the IS standard deviation on the CPS standard deviation yields a coefficient of 0.32 (s.e. 0.13),
a constant of 0.16 (se 0.05) and an R-squared of 26%. Relating changes in mean log wages in
the two datasets yields a correlation coefficient of 0.44, while changes in the standard deviation
in the two datasets yield a correlation coefficient of 30%. We interpret this evidence as saying
that the CEX and the CPS depict similar pictures in terms of the dynamics of inequality in
wages.
To conclude this section, in Figure 5 we plot the standard deviation of log wages in the
CPS. This figure shows a consistent increase throughout the sample period. Between 1990 and
2000, this measure of wage inequality increases by about 0.04. This will be a useful point of
reference when assessing the size of the increase in consumption inequality.

3.3

Consumption inequality

In Figure 1 we plotted the standard deviation of log non-durable consumption in the IS and the
DS. We have already stressed the difference in the time series pattern of the two measures of
consumption. Very similar evidence can be obtained considering other measures of inequality.
Battistin (2003) for instance, reports evidence on the Gini coefficient, and various measures
belonging to the Generalized Entropy Family. This difference is particularly puzzling given
the substantial stationarity between the difference in mean consumption in the two surveys
over time. To make sense of the remarkably different pattern we observe in Figure 1, we start
analyzing simple explanations. In particular, we check whether the difference could be explained
by: (i) changes in questionnaires and survey methodology; (ii) changes in the frequency of
purchases of commodities; (iii) changes in the willingness to answer surveys; and (iv) changes
in the differences in sample compositions.
• Changes in questionnaires and survey methodology. From official BLS documents, analysis of the questionnaires and conversations with BLS staff, we could not identify any
substantive change that would explain the observed differences. The only substantive
change occurs in the IS for the question for food consumed at home, changed in 1982 and
1987 (see Battistin, 2003). The first change, 1982, is outside our interval and the second
change, 1988, precedes the point in which the two measures of inequality start to diverge
(1991). Moreover, such an explanation would be difficult to square with the absence of
changes in the difference of means.
• Increase in the number of zeros in the DS. A potentially attractive explanation is the
following. Over time, people shop less frequently and purchase larger quantities in each
shopping trip. As the horizon of the two surveys is different (two weeks for the DS, three

months for the IS), the DS would result in the same mean (or a stable difference over time)
but increasingly larger variances over time in the DS because of the increased number
of zeros. Table 4 (see Battistin, 2003) shows that the number of non-zero expenditures
for non-durable items varies over time for some groups (particularly, it decreases for
‘alcohol’, ‘tobacco’ and ‘clothing’) but with the same pattern across samples. If anything,
the number of zeros seems to increase more in the IS than in the DS (see for instance
food and alcohol). We can therefore confidently dismiss such an explanation.
• Over time people have become less willing to answer accurately or answer at all. Obviously
it is difficult to judge the importance of measurement error over time. However, one can
check whether attrition rates and/or the fraction of incomplete income responses have
changed substantially over time and differentially so for the two surveys. Anecdotal
24

evidence shows that wealthier individuals are less willing to answer. Survey response
rates did not change much over time, remaining between 80% and 90%. McCarthy et al.
(2002) and Slesnick (2001) report evidence in this respect. The same is also true for the
percentage of incomplete income responses. It is therefore unlikely that this could explain
the different trend in inequality painted by the two CEX surveys.
• Survey non-response. It is widely believed that households who refuse to take part into
surveys are over-represented by very rich and very poor. If so, we would possibly underestimate inequality because of under-representation of CUs in the upper and lower tail
of the distribution of consumption. It might be that a larger number of wealthier individual are being lost in the IS survey. While such an hypothesis has been suggested (by
Sabelhaus, 1996, among others) it is unlikely that it could explain the observed different
pattern between IS and DS. We control for differences in sample composition by using
our propensity score weights and do not find that these differences (or other differences in
sample composition) can explain the different dynamics of inequality in the two samples.
• Changes in sample compositions. As we have already mentioned the composition of the
IS and DS is different, even after using the BLS weights. For instance, the DS is better
educated than the IS. While these differences change marginally over time, we control for
them by using propensity score weights and show that these differences cannot explain
the different dynamics of inequality.
Having discarded some simple explanations of the puzzling patterns observed in Figure 1,
we now look at the dynamics of inequality in the two subsets of goods we have defined as R
goods and D goods in Table 2. This is possible because both sets of goods are observed in both
surveys. In Figure 6, we plot the square of the coefficient of variation of ‘D goods’ as measured

in both surveys, while in Figure 7, we plot the square of the coefficient of variation of ‘R goods’
as measured in both surveys.
Two features of these pictures are noteworthy. First, the coefficient of variation of ‘D goods’
seems to be increasing in both surveys. On the other hand, the coefficient of variation of ‘R
goods’ increases slightly in the DS, while it stays constant in the IS after 1990. The drop
observed in IS for 86 and 87 may be related to the change in the food question as discussed in
Battistin (2003). The divergence in the path of measured coefficients of variation between the
two surveys is particularly evident in the first part of the sample, until 1990. Second, for both
sets of goods, the coefficient of variation is much larger in the DS than in the IS. This feature
might be a consequence of the shorter horizon covered by the DS and the larger number of
zeros documented in Table 4.

COMBINING INFORMATION FROM INTERVIEW
AND DIARY SAMPLES

Rather than pursuing further the attempt to explain the difference between inequality measures
observed in the IS and DS, in this section we propose a different approach. The main reason for
the existence of two different samples is that the BLS believes that different methodologies are
more appropriate in measuring different commodities. Indeed, the weights for the CPI, as well
as aggregate estimates produced by the BLS, ultimately combine information from the IS and
the DS, in that some commodities are deemed to be better measured in the IS, while others in
the DS.
In Table 2 we listed which categories, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (2003), are
better measure by each survey. Let C ∗ be total expenditure on all non-durable commodities
∗
+ CR∗ ,
C ∗ = CD

27

(1)

∗
where CD
and CR∗ represent expenditures on items that are better measured in DS and IS data,

respectively. Obviously, being both surveys (almost) exhaustive, a measure of ‘R goods’ exists
also in the DS and a measure of (most) ‘D goods’ exists also in the IS.10
More accurate estimates of average non-durable consumption can easily be obtained by
combining information from the two surveys. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that straightforward pooling can not be implemented since diary and recall expenditures are not observed for
the same survey households. If one is interested in the variance of non-durable consumption,
the problem is more complicated.
In what follows, we will be interested in the squared coefficient of variation
CV (C ∗ )2 =

∗
∗
V ar(C ∗ )
V ar(CD
) + V ar(CR∗ ) + 2Cov(CD
, CR∗ )
=
.
∗
E(C ∗ )2
[E(CD
) + E(CR∗ )]2

(2)

The reason for this choice is twofold. First, if total consumption is log-normally distributed,
the following relationship holds exactly
·

¸
V ar(C ∗ )
V ar(lnC ) = ln
+1 ,
E(C ∗ )2
∗

so that the quantity in (2) is informative on the variance of log consumption. Blundell and
Lewbel (1999) provide strong empirical evidence to support the fact that, in a variety of datasets
the cross sectional distribution of consumption seems to be very well approximated by a lognormal.11 Second, regardless of the distribution of consumption, the squared coefficient of
variation provides a first order approximation to the variance of log-consumption and therefore
is of some interest as an index of inequality.
10

The reason for the qualifiers in parentheses is the existence of a small subset of commodities (mainly personal
care items) on which there is information in the DS and no information in the IS (as pointed out in Table 1).
We discuss the implications of the presence of these goods after we describe our approach.
11
It is worth noting that the measure of total consumption considered by Blundell and Lewbel (1999) is
derived from the Family Expenditure Survey for the UK, where information on ‘R’ and ‘D’ goods is collected
on the same households using the most appropriate methodology as defined in Table 2.

28

Each household is either observed in the DS or in the IS. However, for each households, in
both surveys, we observe expenditure on both D and R commodities. In what follows, we will
denote by C d total non-durable expenditure as measured in the DS and by C r total non-durable
expenditure as measured in the IS.12 Observed consumption in the two surveys is then given
by
d
+ CRd ,
C d = CD

(3)

r
+ CRr .
C r = CD

As we mentioned above, the BLS thinks that the DS measures accurately commodities in D,
while the IS measures well commodities in R. We translate this assertion in the following
extreme assumption.
Assumption 1
d
∗
CD
= CD
,

CRr = CR∗ .
Accordingly, the reporting error in DS and IS figures comes from CR and CD , respectively
C d − C ∗ = CRd − CR∗ = νRd ,

If Assumption 1 is satisfied, the mean of IS and DS errors is identified by E(νD

)−
d
E(CD

d
can be estimated by E(C ∗ ) = E(CRr ) + E(CD
). Figures for IS and DS errors as proportion of

As mentioned above, for the time being we are ignoring the fact that some ‘D goods’ are not observed in
the IS. We tackle this problem below.

29

total non-durable expenditure are reported in Battistin (2003), where implications on estimated
saving rates from the IS are also discussed.13
Note that we do not require measurement error to be of the classical type. Indeed, classical
measurement error , and in particular the absence of correlation between the measurement error
and the true level of the relevant variable and Assumption 1 would imply a larger measured
variance of ‘R goods’ in the DS and of ‘D goods’ in the IS. This implication is obviously
contradicted by Figures 6 and 7 .
As we can easily estimate the denominator of (2) by combining the two data sets, we will
focus here on the estimation of the cross sectional variance for a given group of individual
households. From equation (2), it is clear that to estimate the variance of C ∗ we lack an
∗
estimate of the Cov(CD
, CR∗ ). Equations (4) and (5) together with Assumption 1 imply that

observed covariances in the two surveys are informative about such a covariance, since

Clearly, if we assumed that either Cov(CD

to identify Cov(CD

∗
r
that Cov(CD
, vRd ) = 0, we could test whether Cov(CR∗ , νD

these alternative two tests are equivalent to testing whether

While the assumption of no measurement error in D commodities in the DS and of no measurement error
in R commodities in the IS is extreme, it is made here only for expositional convenience. As we discuss later,
it can be slightly relaxed without changing the substance of our argument.

Equation (6) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for our identification assumption. If
∗
∗
r
Cov(CD
, νRd ) = 0, we can identify Cov(CD
, CR∗ ) from the DS, while if Cov(CR∗ , νD
) = 0 we can

identify from the IS. Unfortunately, the restriction in equation (6) is rejected in our data (see
Battistin, 2003).
However, if we are only interested in the changes of the variance (or of the coefficient of
variation) of consumption, we can use a weaker and less unappealing identification assumption.

Such an hypothesis is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the point identification of

A non-rejection of the relationship in (8) does not guarantee that Assumption 2 is correct:
it is possible that the covariances of measurement error with the true value change in both
31

surveys in the same way, while we need that such covariances are constant over time. It should
be stressed however, that the assumption of a homoscedastic measurement error is implicitly
made by all studies that analyze changes in inequality over time.
As we mentioned above, for some commodities, mainly personal care items, the only available information is that in the DS, as the IS does not ask the relevant retrospective questions.
This slightly complicates the approach sketched above. Equation (1) now becomes
∗
∗
+ CR∗ ,
+ CDp
C ∗ = CDr

(9)

∗
∗
where CDr
are ‘D goods’ also available in the IS and CDp
are ‘D goods’ available only in the

DS. Equation (3) now becomes
d
d
C d = CDr
+ CDp
+ CRd .

Equation (9) implies that one cannot obtain a complete estimate of average total non durable
consumption from the IS. Moreover, when one wants to compute the variance, one gets
∗
∗
∗
∗
V ar(C ∗ ) = V ar(CDr
+ CDp
) + V ar(CR∗ ) + 2[Cov(CDr
, CR∗ ) + Cov(CDp
, CR∗ )].

(10)

The first of the two covariances in the last expression can only be estimated, under the
∗
∗
assumption that Cov(CDp
+ CDr
, νRd ) = 0. As before, if we are only interested in the changes
∗
∗
in this covariances, we can use the less restrictive assumption that ∆Cov(CDp
+ CDr
, νRd ) = 0.
∗
∗
r
However, we will not be able to test the hypothesis that ∆Cov(CDp
+CDr
, νRd ) = ∆Cov(CR∗ , νD
).

In other words, if all the commodities in the DS were also observable in the IS, we could use
either the covariance between D and R goods estimated in the DS or that estimated in the IS
∗
to compute the (changes in the) variance of total consumption. Now, at least for Cov(CDp
, CR∗ )
∗
we are forced to use the DS. For Cov(CDr
, CR∗ ), however, we can use, as before both surveys.

In addition to the raw estimate, we also plot a smoothed version of each measure obtained by
a third order moving average.
The necessary condition in equation (8) is equivalent to the hypotheses that the distance
between the two lines in equation (7) is constant. In Table 5 we test such a hypothesis by
regressing the difference between the two lines on a constant and a linear trend and test for
the coefficient of the linear trend to be zero. Unfortunately, we can reject the null if we use the
whole sample (see the left hand side panel). However, if we restrict the sample to the 1990s
(see the right hand side panel), we do not reject the null. The changes in the DS questionnaire
in the early 1990s, might constitute a justification for restricting the sample to the 1990s.
A possible interpretation of Figure 8 is that regardless of whether we use the DS or the
∗
IS based measure of Cov(CDr
, CR∗ ), the evidence indicates a slight decline of inequality in the

34

late 1980s followed by a sustained increase during the 1990s. The magnitude of the increase,
∗
however, is debatable. If we use estimates of Cov(CDr
, CR∗ ) based on the DS, we get a larger

increase than if we use estimates from the IS.14
If we decide that Assumption 2 is a valid one, the two lines in Figure 7 give us two measures of
the changes in consumption inequality. An issue is therefore how to combine this information to
obtain a single efficient measure. Figure 9 presents our estimates of the evolution of consumption
inequality (from an arbitrary starting point) obtained from the entire CEX sample, as it results
from combining efficiently the two lines in Figure 8. In the Figure we also plot confidence
intervals (dotted lines).
Denoting with θ̂R and θ̂D the estimate of (2) obtained using IS and DS covariances respectively, we obtain the estimates in Figure 9 as
αθˆR + (1 − α)θ̂D ,
where the value of α is chosen so to minimize the variance of the estimator. The first order
condition gives
α∗ =

Cov(θ̂D , θ̂D − θ̂R )
V ar(θ̂D − θ̂R )

,

which corresponds to the coefficient of an OLS regression of θ̂D on θ̂D − θ̂R . We estimate the
optimal value of α for each time period t between 1986 and 2001 via re-sampling methods using
1000 pseudo-samples from the original dataset.
To improve the readability of figure 9, Table 6 reports observed inequality growth over time
from IS and DS data. As we mentioned above, the level of inequality is not identified. Strictly
speaking the figure is only informative about changes in inequality over time. We pin down
14

By using stronger assumptions, one can also relax Assumption 1 of no measurement error in some components of the survey. In the Appendix we spell out which assumptions are necessary to achieve identification in
this case. The results we present below would be unaffected by this slightly different approach.

35

the level so to place the initial level of inequality between the initial levels of inequality in the
DS and IS in 1986.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the estimate we obtain for the changes in inequality are in between
the paths for the DS and the IS. However, having gone through the exercise of using optimally
the information coming from the IS and the DS, the interesting question is a quantitative
one: by how much does inequality increase according to our estimates? The answer is: by a
substantial amount. According to our results, inequality rises by about 5.4 percentage points
over the 1990s. This results is economically very different from that reported by Krueger and
Perri (2003) and from the change observed in the IS, which is approximately 1 percentage point
increase during the same period and points out to an order of magnitude similar to the increase
in the inequality in male wages mentioned in Section 3.

CONCLUSIONS

This paper starts from the puzzle that, when following the evolution of consumption inequality during the late 1980s and the 1990s in the US in the two available surveys, one obtains
very different and contradictory patters. We use the information that some components of
consumption are better measured in the Diary survey while others are better measured in the
Interview survey to obtain a new view on the pattern of inequality in the US. Obviously, as
we do not observe the same households in the two surveys, we can get a point estimate of the
cross sectional variance of total non-durable consumption only by making some assumptions
on the nature of measurement error.
From our analysis we conclude that consumption inequality has increased substantially more
than what indicated by the path of the standard deviation of log consumption in the Interview
Survey (and substantially less than what indicated in the Diary Survey). The increase, of 5.4
36

percentage points, is economically significant.
Our results are reasonably robust. Moreover, of the two assumptions we have used we
can conceivably relax the one that states there is no measurement error in some commodities
in the Diary Survey and in other commodities in the Interview Survey. By assuming that
stationarity of the measurement error processes we would obtain essentially the same results
we have presented in this paper.
Assumption 2 is crucial to identify changes over time in consumption inequality but the
assumption does not help identification of its level. Without that assumption, one can try to
put bounds on the unknown covariance between expenditure on items in R and D. Battistin
(2003) shows that Cauchy-Schwartz bounds on the level of consumption inequality can be
derived using Assumption 1. By looking at these bounds, Battistin (2003) shows that the
effect of reporting errors should be massive to discard increasing inequality over time, even if
Assumption 2 were not satisfied. Battistin (2003) performs a sensitivity analysis with respect
to the true value of the correlation coefficient between items in R and D, ρ∗ say. Inequality is
found to be statistically increasing over time unless the effect of reporting errors on ρ∗ is such
that observed correlations in IS and DS data and ρ∗ are more than 100% apart (in absolute
terms).
