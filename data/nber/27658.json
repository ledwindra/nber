    "abstract": "\n\nGrowing reliance on student loans and repayment difficulties have raised concerns of a student debt crisis in the United States, but little is known about the effects of student borrowing on human capital and long\u2010run financial well\u2010being. We use variation induced by recent expansions in federal loan limits combined with administrative datasets to identify the effects of increased access to student loans on credit\u2010constrained students\u2019 educational attainment, earnings, debt, and loan repayment. Increased student loan availability raises student debt and improves degree completion, later\u2010life earnings, and student loan repayment while having no effect on homeownership or other types of debt.\n\n",
