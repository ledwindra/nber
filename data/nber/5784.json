This paper assesses the empirical evidence of this aproach, by deriving an explicit solution for the optimal international portfolio and applying the model to a set of fourteen OECD countries.  Computing asset returns according to a `fundamentals' approach, it is possible to account for an average gap of no more than 10-15 percantage points between estimated domestic ownership shares and domestic shares under full diversification.  When stock-market data are directly used, the predicted coefficient of home bias shrinks to 3%.\n\n",
