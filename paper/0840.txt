A Comparison of Tournaments and Contracts

ABS TRACT

Tournaments, reward structures based on rank order, are compared with
individual contracts in a model with one risk—neutral principal and many

risk—averse agents. Each agents's output is a stochastic function of his
effort level plus an additive shock term that is common to all the agents.

The principal observes only the output levels of the agents. It is shown
that in the absence of a common shock, using optimal independent contracts

dominates using the optimal tournament. Conversely, if the distribution
of the common shock is sufficiently diffuse, using the optimal tournament

dominates using optimal independent contracts. Finally, it is shown that
for a sufficiently large number of agents, a principal who cannot observe
the common shock but uses the optimal tournament, does as well as one who
can observe the shock and uses independent contracts.

1. Introduction
At the Olympics prizes are awarded not on the basis of absolute

performance, but rather on the basis of relative performance. Similarly, in
most organizations one of the most important rewards is promotion. If the
hierarchical structure of the organization is fixed, employees at any one
echelon are competing for a fixed, smaller number of positions at the next

higher echelon. The goal for these employees is not just to do well, but to
do better than their peers.
The existing literature on incentives and contract design has been
concerned primarily with the case where a principal employs only one agent,

and rewards him on the basis of absolute performance. Exceptions include two
recent papers about tournaments——reward structures based on rank order, and
one that considers more general compensation schemes for iailti—agent settings.

The first is by Lazear and Rosen [1981], who examine the problem of a

risk—neutral firm with two employees. The output of each agent depends
stochastically on his own

effort

and on an additive shock that is common to

both. The agents do not know the value of the common shock at the time they
choose their effort levels; they do know its distribution. It is shown that
if the agents are risk—neutral, an optimal two—person tournament is

equivalent, for all three parties, to offering the optimal incentive contract

to each agent independently. In either case, because the agents are risk—
neutral, the moral hazard problem can be avoided costlessly by shifting all

risk onto the agents. Lazear and Rosen also compare linear piece rates and
tournaments for the case of risk—averse agents and a normally distributed

shock. They show that

if

the variance of the shock term is sufficiently

large, the optImal tournament yields higher expected utilities.

Stiglitz [19811 compares tournaments and independent contracts using a

—2—
somewhat different specification of the production technology. Here the shock
is nultiplicative, so that it affects the marginal product of labor. A wide
variety of cases and examples are studied.
Finally, Holmstrom [1981] examines arbitrary relative performance schemes

for risk—averse agents. He shows that for either additive or multiplicative
shocks, because the mean output level is a sufficient statistic for all of the

information about the common shock, optimal contracts can be designed in which
each agent's reward depends only on his own output level and on the mean
output level.

In all of these models, compensation schemes that base an agent's reward
on the performance of his peers as well as his own, take advantage of the fact
that the vector of output levels for the whole group is a source of

information about the common shock——which by assumption the principal cannot

observe directly. Optimal compensation schemes for groups of agents can, in
general, have arbitrary and complicated functional forms——depending on
assumptions about tastes, technology, and distributions for the error terms.
In practise, on the other hand, rather simple schemes are often used.
Consequently, it is useful to study the properties of simple schemes——to

understand when they perform "almost" as well as "optimal contracts. That is
the viewpoint adopted here, where we compare the efficiency of independent

contracts and tournaments. Under the former each agent's reward depends only
on his own output level, while under the latter it depends only on his rank

order. These represent the extreme cases of reward structures based on
absolute and relative performance.

We consider a situation in which one risk—neutral principal employs a

group of identical risk—averse agents. As in the Lazear—Rosen model, each
agent's output is assumed to depend stochastically on his own effort and a

—3—
common additive shock term. The common shock might represent economic

conditions which affect all of the agents. We allow agents to observe private
signals, correlated with this common shock, before they choose their effort

levels. The realized output of each agent then is a stochastic function of
his effort and the value of the common shock. The principal observes only the
output levels of the agents.

We assume throughout that the principal is constrained to offer a fixed
minimum level of expected itility to each agent, so that we can judge the
relative performance of contracts and tournaments by examining the expected

payoff of the principal. The principal's objective function is the sum of the
outputs of all the agents minus the sum of the rewards paid to all of them.

We show that for any finite number of agents, in the absence of a common
error term, using the optimal tournament is dominated by using optimal

independent contracts. In the absence of a common shock, the output levels of
the rest of the group convey no information about the effort level of an

agent. Using a tournament in this case only introduces extraneous noise into
the payoff function that agent faces. Since the agents are risk—averse, this
is costly for the principal.

Conversely, given any group of at least two agents, if the distribution
of the common error term is sufficiently diffuse, then the optimal tournament

dominates using optimal independent contracts. In this case using tournaments
eliminates a major source of noise, while adding a relatively minor one.

Finally, given any fixed distribution for the common error term, for a
sufficiently large number of agents, using the optimal tournament dominates

using optimal independent contracts. In fact, if the number of agents is
sufficiently large, a principal who cannot observe the value of the common
shock and uses an optimal tournament can do as well as a principal who can

—4—
observe the value of the shock and uses general, interdependent contracts.
For a large enough group of agents, an agent's rank order is an extremely
accurate signal about his output level net of the common additive shock.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 tastes,
technology, distributions, and feasible sets of tournaments and contracts are
described; in Section 3 tournaments and independent contracts are compared;
and in Section 4 the conclusions are discussed.

2. The Model
We consider the problem faced by a principal who employs a fixed group of

agents, i —

1,.,n.

The agents are all identical ex ante. The preferences of

each agent i over his income, m1, and his effort, x1, are represented by the
von Neumann—Morgenstern utility function

U1(mj,x1) =

is strictly increasing and strictly concave.'

The output of agent 1, y1, depends stochastically on his effort level,

x1. In particular,

—

+n,

(2)

where n c R is a random variable affecting all of the agents, and zi is a
random variable whose distribution depends on x1. Let F( ;x1) denote the
conditional distribution function for Zj given x1; since the agents are

identical ex ante, F does not depend on i. Assume that

for

any effort level x

) 0, the distribution function for output, F( ;x) has a continuous density

—5—
function f( ;x) which is positive everywhere and continuously differentiable
in x.

The agents observe private signals about n before choosing their effort
levels; let a1 c R denote the signal observed by agent 1, and let C denote the

distribution function for (n,a). Note that this formulation includes
situations where all agents observe the same signal, independent signals,

completely,

signals that reveal 11

and signals that are uncorrelated with n.

Assume that Zj and (n,a) are independent, and assume that r has zero mean.

f

ndG(r,a)

(3)

(Except where otherwise indicated, integration is over the entire range.)
The principal's problem is to design a reward structure for the n

agents. The principal is risk—neutral and seeks to maximize the expected sum
of the outputs net of total payments to the agents.

E[

(y1 1—1

mi)]

(4)

By assumption the principal observes only the output levels of the
agents, y

he cannot directly observe either the agents'

effort levels or the realization of any random variable. Under independent
contracts agent i's reward depends only on his own

output

level, Yj' while

under a tournament it depends only on the rank order of y1 in y.
Given any reward structure, the problem facing each agent is to choose a

level of effort. First consider the situation under independent contracts.
Since the agents are identical, we can consider the problem facing a
representative agent 1.

It is convenient to think of the principal as

—6—
constructing the reward function in terms

of utility. For any reward fnction

R(y), let v(y) be defined as its representation in utility terms, v(y)

u(R(y)).

The cost to the principal of providing this level of utility is then given by

y(v(y)), where y u. Since u is strictly increasing and strictly concave,
y is strictly increasing and strictly convex. Agent i observes

and then

chooses the level of effort that maximizes his expected utility. Since the
optimal level of effort will depend on the value of ci, the optimal decision
rule for the agent is a function X(ai).

The principal's problem is to choose (v,X) to maximize (4) subject to the
two constraints that X be an optimal decision rule for the agent given v, and

that the expected utility of the agent be at least u0. Given G, define Si(G)
to be the set of contracts that are feasible for the ith agent:

{(v,X)I v:R+ +

Si(G)

[O,B],

X:R +

R+;

X(a1) c argmax f v(y)f f(y—ri;x)dG(rI,aiIa)dy —

ff (v(y) —

X(a))f(y—n;X(a))dG(n,a)dy

)

x, v

u°};

(5b)

and define Pi(v,X,G) to be the expected payoff of the principal from the
contract (v,X):

Pj(v,X,G)

ff (y —

y(v(y))f(y—rx(a1))dydc(,a).

The feasible set is always non—empty, since it always contains the "no—

incentive contract: (v u0,X

payoff to the principal under this contract, call it

independent

of C.

P0

ff (z + n —

Pi(v°,X°,G)
=

y(u°))f(z;O)dzdc(n,a)

f zf(z;O)dz — 1(u°)

Next consider the situation under a tournament. As above it is
convenient to express rewards in terms of utility. In an n—person tournament

with prizes (W1,W2,...,w), define w =

(w1,w2,...,w) by w u(W1), Vi.

(We use the numbering conventional In the study of order statistics: "first
place" Is the lowest outcome, and w1 is the prize received by the agent with

the lowest output, etc.) We will consider symmetric Nash equilibria of the
game in which each agent's strategy is his effort level.2
Since each agent's output is given by y1

Y1

>

Yj <> Z

z1 + 71:

>

Zj•

That is, the rank order of the outputs depends only on the zj's and

on r.

Therefore, the realization of (i,a) does not affect the game played by the

agents, and the equilibrium effort level will be Independent of a. Hence we
can analyze the game in terms just of the z1's. In an n—person tournament,
agent I wins prize w if and only if zi Is the jth order statistic of

(z1,...,z). Define:

•j(z;x)

= (fl_j)!(j_l)!z;x)F(z;x)(1_F(z;x))i

That is, •j(z;x) Is the density function for the jth order statistic in a
sample of size n drawn from the distribution F( ;x).

—8—
As above, the principal is constrained to offer the agents an expected

utility of at least u°. We are interested only in tournaments that have
symmetric Nash equilibria. Given n and G, the set of feasible n—person
tournaments, ST(n,C), is defined by:

Lemma 1: The set of feasible tournaments, the expected payoff of the principal
under any feasible tournament, and hence the optimal tournament, each depend
on the number of players ii, and on the distribution function F, but not on
the distribution function C.

Lemma 1 is interesting in its own right, since it says that tournaments are

robust against lack of information or lack of agreement about G. It will also

—9—
be

useful for our later results. Note that the set of feasible tournaments is

always non—empty, since it always contains the "no—incentive" tournament:

for all n. The payoff per agent to the principal

under this tournament is P°.

First we will show that the proposed contract satisfies (5a) and (5b).

In Lenuna 2 we show that any contract for which the payoff function is

piecewise continuous and the agent's optimal effort level is unique, can be
approximated arbitrarily closely by a payoff function that is a step

function. Then in Lemma 3 we show that each of these step function contracts
can be approximated arbitrarily closely by tournament with a sufficiently
large number of players.

Q.E.D.

Conclusions
In the model above, all agents' output levels are subject to the same

random shock. Thus, the output levels of the group provide the principal with
information about the value of the common shock, and consequently about the
portion of any particular agent's output that is attributable to effort.

Relative performance schemes——of which tournaments are an extreme form——allow
the principal to make use of this information.

Obviously tournaments employ available information in a rather

inefficient and inflexible way. In the model above, tournaments tend to
reduce the randomness of any agent's compensation by filtering out the common

shock term. However, they also tend to increase the randomness in any agent's
compensation by making his reward depend on the idiosyncratic shocks of his

peers. Proposition 1 and 2 show that the relative advantage of tournaments
vis a vis contracts depends on which effect dominates.
Despite the fact that a tournament makes inefficient use of information,
Proposition 3 shows that this entails no loss if the number of agents is

sufficiently large. In large groups, the rank order of an agent's observed
output is a very accurate esimator of his output net of the common shock.

Tournaments are not, in general, "optimal" contracts. Why then are

rankings so commonly used as an evaluation criterion? First, it may be

substantially

easier to determine agents' rankings than to measure their

output levels. In addition, as shown in Lemma 1 neither the set of feasible
tournaments nor the optimal tournament depends on the distribution function
f or the common shock and agents' signals. This is an obvious advantage if
that distribution is unknown or imprecisely known——as it would be, for

example, in nonstationary environments. Since in large group the inefficiency
due to information loss is negligable, tournaments will perform very well in
such settings.

'The

fact that "effort enters linearly into each agent's utility function

involves no loss of generality. Since "effort" is never aggregated across
agents, units of effort are simply defined as whatever causes units of

disutility to the agent. Under this units convention P reflects both the
concavity of the agent's utility function in "hours" (or some other standard
unit of measurement), as well as the concavity of the production function in

"hours." If at least one of these functions is strictly concave, then (3)
holds. The agent's utility of income is bounded to avoid problems of the type
discussed by Mirrlees [19751.

2For arbitrary prize structures, there may be no Nash equilibrium——

symmetric or otherwise. This is of no importance to us, since we are
considering only tournaments that are designed so that they do have a

symmetric Nash equilibrium. The restriction to tournaments with symmetric
equilibria is purely on the grounds of tractability.

3This result is (almost) a special case of Theorem 10 in Holmstrom

[19811. (In Holmstrom's model agents do not have access to any information
about the common shock.) Proposition 1 is included here for the sake of
completeness.
