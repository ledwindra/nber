Markov Forecasting Methods for Welfare Caseloads
Jeffrey Grogger
NBER Working Paper No. 11682
October 2005
JEL No. I3
ABSTRACT
Forecasting welfare caseloads, particularly turning points, has become more important than ever.
Since welfare reform, welfare has been funded via a block grant, which means that unforeseen
changes in caseloads can have important fiscal implications for states. In this paper I develop
forecasts based on the theory of Markov chains. Since today's caseload is a function of the past
caseload, the caseload exhibits inertia. The method exploits that inertia, basing forecasts of the future
caseload on past functions of entry and exit rates. In an application to California welfare data, the
method accurately predicted the late-2003 turning point roughly one year in advance.

I. Introduction
Forecasting welfare caseloads has become more important than ever. One reason
is the magnitude of recent fluctuations. Figure 1 exhibits the number of welfare cases in
California between July 1985 and March 2005. The general patterns there are similar to
those in other states. After growing slowly during the late 1980s, caseload growth
accelerated starting around 1989. When the caseload peaked in March 1995 (about a
year later than the national caseload peak), almost 915,000 households were receiving aid
under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. In the late 1990s
the caseload plummeted, reaching a low of just under 445,000 cases in November 2003.
Since then it has grown a bit, standing at nearly 463,000 cases as of March 2005.
Whether the recent rebound represents a true turning point, foretelling further
growth in the caseload, or a relatively minor fluctuation about a new, stable level, is a
matter of keen interest for both forecasters and program administrators. Turning points
are particularly difficult to forecast, and public aid caseloads represent no exception to
this rule. Dynarski et al. (1991) attempted to forecast Food Stamp caseloads, which
fluctuated in a manner similar to the welfare caseload during the 1980s and 1990s.
Despite their extensive modeling effort, Dynarski et al. concluded that their model did
not yield "highly accurate" forecasts, and that "none of the … models would have
captured the increase in participation that began in 1989" (p. xi).
From the viewpoint of program administrators, turning points impose a particular
burden. Unforeseen swings in the caseload complicate the appropriations process. They
may also cause logistical problems for the administration of eligibility and service
delivery operations.

Perhaps most importantly, recent changes in the funding of welfare programs
mean that substantial fluctuations in welfare caseloads could have broader implications
for state spending and tax policy. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Restoration Act (PRWORA) replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families (TANF) and changed the funding formula used to finance welfare expenditures.
Whereas AFDC expenditures were shared between federal and state governments, TANF
is funded with a block grant. This means that sufficient growth in TANF cases could
force states to curtail eligibility, reduce benefits, reduce spending on other state
programs, or raise taxes to support higher spending. Although the threat of such welfaredriven fiscal dislocations is currently low due to the high funding level of the TANF
block grant, recent proposals to reduce the federal block grant could present states with
difficult choices if caseloads were to rise substantially.
The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new method for forecasting welfare
caseloads. I refer to the technique as Markov forecasting because it is motivated by
results from the theory of Markov chains. I apply the technique to caseload data from
California. It provides forecasts of the caseload a little more than one year in advance.
Most importantly, it predicts turning points reasonably well.
It differs in important ways from the two traditional approaches to forecasting,
known as time-series forecasting and econometric forecasting. Time-series forecasting
treats future caseloads as a function of past caseloads and past forecasting errors (Box
and Jenkins, 1970). Its advantage is that it can be applied relatively quickly and cheaply
to any time series. Its disadvantage is that it takes no special account of the nature of the
data, and thus represents something of a black box. The traditional alternative,

2

econometric forecasting, models the caseload as a function of variables thought to
influence it, such as economic conditions and the policy environment (Granger and
Newbold 1977). Its advantage is that it shows why the caseload changes. Its
disadvantages are that such models can be costly to construct and that their forecasts
require forecasts of the independent variables thought to affect the caseload.
Markov forecasting is based on a model of caseload evolution. In the simplest
terms, today’s caseload depends on yesterday’s caseload plus entries and exits. Because
today’s caseload depends in part on yesterday’s caseload, the caseload exhibits inertia.
Markov forecasting exploits that inertia to base forecasts of the future caseload on current
entries and exits. Put differently, current entries and exits affect current caseloads, but
since today’s caseload affects future caseloads, current entries and exits affect future
caseloads as well. If turnover is not too great, then there is a lag between changes in
entries and exits and the time that those changes are fully reflected in the caseload. Thus
current trends in entries and exits help predict future caseloads.
Markov theory motivates a leading indicator that is based on entries and exits.
The leading indicator is the key to Markov forecasting. A problem with the leading
indicator is that it exhibits much more month-to-month volatility than the caseload. It
stands to reason that a smoothed version of the leading indicator, which distinguishes the
underlying signal from month-to-month noise, should provide a better predictor of the
relatively smooth caseload. I propose a means for choosing the key smoothing
parameters to optimize a measure of out-of-sample forecasting performance.
I develop this approach more formally in the third section of the paper, after
describing my data in the next section. I present results in section IV. Finally, in the

3

conclusion, I discuss a number of ways in which the approach might be generalized in
future work.
II. Data
My data come from the California Department of Social Services’ Form CA237,
which tracks the movement of cases on and off the rolls on a monthly basis. The data
consist of monthly state-level welfare entries, welfare exits, and the caseload as of the
end of the month. My sample period runs from July 1985 to March 2005. Since the late
1990s these data have been available on-line at the DSS web site.1
Table 1 presents some summary statistics. The monthly caseload, which is
depicted in Figure 1, averaged 650,632 cases over the sample period. On average, entries
and exits are similar, averaging roughly 41,000 to 42,000 per month. This implies that on
average, about 13 percent of the caseload turns over each month. The average exit rate,
defined as exits divided by the previous month’s caseload, is 6.7 percent.
Figure 2 depicts entries and exit rates. Entries are represented by the short-dashed
line and the exit rate is represented by the long-dashed line. The scale for entries is on
the left; the scale for the exit rate is on the right. The solid line in the figure is the ratio of
entries to exits, which I discuss in more detail below.
As compared to the caseload, entries and exits exhibit much more month-tomonth volatility. Nevertheless, the general trends in entries and exits help explain the
substantial swings in the caseload during the sample period. As seen in Figure 2, entries
rose gradually from the beginning of the sample period to about the beginning of 1994.
The exit rate was roughly constant, aside from monthly volatility, until the late 1980s. It

then fell till early 1994. Thus the rise in the caseload in the early 1990s stemmed from
both an increase in entries and a decrease in the exit rate.
After early 1994, entries declined and the exit rate rose. Just as the increase in the
caseload during the early 1990s stemmed from increasing entries and a decreasing exit
rate, the decrease in the caseload during the latter half of the 1990s resulted from a
decrease in entries and an increase in the exit rate. Grogger, Haider, and Klerman (2003)
estimated that decreasing entries accounted for about 66 percent of the caseload decline
between 1995 and 2000, with increasing exit rates accounting for the remainder.
After the 1990s, entries began to rise again, at least until the beginning of 2004.
By themselves, increasing entries would result in higher caseloads. However, the exit
rate continued to rise until mid-2004. Thus between the beginning of 2000 and 2004, the
caseload fell due to increases in the exit rate, despite increasing entries. Since the
beginning of 2004, the pattern has reversed. By itself, the sharp decline in the exit rate in
2004 would have increased the caseload. Figure 1 indicates that it has indeed risen, but
the increase would have been greater without the decline in entries that appears at the end
of the sample period.
III. Methods
A. The Welfare Caseload as a Markov Chain
An important feature of Figures 1 and 2 is that turning points in entries and exits
tend to precede turning points in the caseload. This is most obvious in the mid-1990s.
Whereas entries peaked and exits reached a low in early 1994, the caseload rose until
March 1995. Markov theory provides insights into why this is true. It also motivates a
leading indicator of the caseload that is based on entry and exit data.

5

The basic building block of a Markov chain is a relation that describes the current
caseload as a function of the past caseload and current entries and exits. The simplest
possible model of caseload evolution is given by
Ct = Ct −1 + Et − X t
= Ct −1 (1 − xt ) + Et

(1)

where Ct represents the caseload in month t, Ct-1 represents the caseload in the previous
month, Et represents current entries, Xt represents current-month exits, and xt represents
the exit rate, defined as xt = Xt/Ct-1. The top line says simply that current cases equal last
month’s cases plus entries less exits. The second line expresses the same relationship in
terms of entries and the exit rate, which is a more useful form for the analysis to follow.
Because the current caseload depends on the past caseload, the caseload exhibits
inertia. This means that it takes time for the full effects of changes in entries or exits to
be reflected in the caseload. Markov forecasting exploits this lag to forecast future
caseloads on the basis of current entries and exits.
Equation (1) is referred to as a first-order Markov chain because the process
depends on only current entries and exits and the first lag of the caseload. Higher-order
models could be employed for forecasting, but they would require household-level data
rather than the state-level aggregated data I use here. The reason is that households are
only at risk of exiting during the second month of their spell if they do not exit during the
first month. It is impossible to distinguish first-month exits from second-month exits
with aggregate data. I discuss higher-order models further in Section V.
A key property of a Markov chain is its steady state (see Klerman and Haider
2004 and references therein). The steady state represents the target toward which the
caseload would converge if entries and the exit rate were to remain constant indefinitely
6

at values E and x, respectively. For the simple model in equation (1), the steady state is
given by
C=

E
.
x

(2)

In the welfare context, the notion of a steady state may seem to be of little value.
As shown in Figure 2, entries and exit rates are never constant for very long.
Nevertheless, the notion of the steady state motivates the leading indicator of the welfare
caseload which is the key to Markov forecasting. I refer to this quantity as the implied
steady state, or ISS. It is given by
E
Ct = t .
xt

(3)

The implied steady state has nothing to do with constant entry or exit rates; it is a
function of current entries and exit rates, and thus changes over time just as entries and
exits change over time. However, if entries and the exit rate were to remain constant at
their current values, the ISS represents the target toward which the caseload would
converge.
In fact, the ISS represents a target more broadly construed. To see this, note that
the change in the caseload from month t-1 to month t can be written as
Ct − Ct −1 = xt (Ct − Ct −1 ) .

(4)

Since the exit rate is always positive, equation (4) says that the change in the caseload
will always have the same sign as the difference between the ISS and last month’s
caseload. Thus if the ISS exceeds last month’s caseload, then the caseload will grow. If
the ISS is less than last month’s caseload, then the caseload will fall.

7

The ISS is plotted in Figure 2 as the solid line. As entries grew and the exit rate
fell in the early 1990s, the ISS rose sharply, preceding the rise in the caseload. The peak
in the ISS occurred in March 1994, one year before the peak in the caseload. The ISS
then fell for several years as the caseload fell. The ISS began rising again in late 2002,
about a year before the caseload reached its recent low in November 2003.
B. Smoothing and Forecasting
Since the turning points in the ISS precede the turning points in the caseload, the
ISS provides a leading indicator of the caseload that can be used in forecasting. One
problem with the ISS is that it exhibits much greater month-to-month volatility than the
caseload. Its value for forecasting would be greater if the month-to-month noise could be
distinguished from the underlying signal that predicts the direction of the caseload.
One technique for distinguishing signal from noise is smoothing. In principle,
one could smooth the ISS directly and use the smoothed values for forecasting.
Alternatively, one could smooth the entries and exit rate, then construct a smooth ISS
from the smoothed entries and exits using equation (3). This latter approach has the
advantage of illustrating whether trends in the ISS stem from trends in entries, the exit
rate, or both. Since this latter approach provides more information, this is the approach I
adopt.
There are many different techniques one could choose for smoothing, ranging
from moving averages to polynomial regression. In the current application I utilize
lowess smoothing. Lowess smoothing involves running a separate smoothing regression
of the dependent variable (entries or the exit rate) on the independent variable (time) for
each value of the independent variable. In this case, this means that a separate smoothing

8

regression is run for each data point. The regression for each data point contains a
limited number of observations within a neighborhood of the data point. The smoothed
value of the dependent variable is the predicted value from that regression (Cleveland
1994).
A virtue of lowess smoothing is that it is local in nature. Only nearby
observations are used to form the smoothed values. In polynomial regression, in contrast,
all observations are used to form smoothed values for each data point. The result is that
aberrations in end-point observations, for example, can affect smoothed values for all
data points.
Of course, one has to define which observations are within the neighborhood of
each data point. In STATA’s implementation of lowess smoothing, the neighborhood is
defined by a bandwidth that indicates the proportion of observations that is used in each
lowess regression. Bandwidths near zero imply that very few observations are used in
each regression, so the fit is highly local. A bandwidth of one implies that all
observations are used in each regression, so the fit is a straight line.
An important question is how to select the bandwidth. Too small a bandwidth
delivers little smoothing, defeating the purpose. Too large a bandwidth may oversmooth
and miss important trends. Furthermore, the degree of smoothing will affect one’s
forecasts. Moreover, bandwidths are not estimated like regression coefficients, but rather
chosen by the analyst. This could add an element of subjectivity to the approach. To
avoid the subjectivity problem, I use the data as a guide to parameter selection, choosing
the bandwidths to minimize the mean squared error of the forecasts that are based on the
smoothed ISS.

9

More concretely, let Et ( β E ) represent the smoothed estimate of Et for bandwidth

β E . Let xt ( β x ) represent the smoothed estimate of xt for bandwidth β x . Define
Ct ( β ) = Et ( β E ) / xt ( β x ) as the smoothed estimate of the ISS given parameter vector ,

where β = ( β E , β x ). The smoothed ISS is used to construct a forecasting regression that
takes the form
Ct = α 0 + α1Ct − L ( β ) + ut ,

t = L+1, …T

(4)

where α = (α 0 ,α1 ) is a vector of parameters that is estimated by OLS, ut is a zero-mean
disturbance term, T is the number of observations used for estimation, and L is the lag
length, that is, the number of months by which the ISS leads the caseload.
Most simply, one could carry out a grid search over various values of and L and
choose and L to minimize the mean square error from equation (4). For each value of
( , L), one would compute

and the mean squared error. The values of , L and

that

minimized the mean squared error would be used to construct Ct − L ( β ) and generate
forecasts of Ct.
However, using such a within-sample fit criterion could lead to overfitting, which
in turn could result in poor forecasts. To avoid overfitting, I choose and L via crossvalidation, which provides an out-of-sample fit criterion (Pagan and Ullah 1999). For
each value of ( , L), I estimate equation (4) not once, but T-L times. From each
regression I drop one observation, select optimal values of ( , L), construct Ct − L ( β ) ,
estimate , and compute the squared prediction error for the omitted observation. The
average of these out-of-sample squared prediction errors is used as the objective function.

10

For forecasting I then employ the values of ( , L) that minimized the objective function to
construct Ct − L ( β ) and estimate

using all the observations.

The grid search was carried out for values of L ranging from 10 to 15 and for
values of β E and β x ranging from .1 to .5 by increments of .01. The optimal parameter
values fell well within the interior of the search space, as I discuss next.
IV. Results
Since my ultimate goal is to assess the forecasting performance of the approach, I
employ only a subset of the sample in estimation. To assess whether the approach
predicts turning points well, I end the estimation sample in November 2002, a full year
before the caseload reached its minimum in November 2003. This provides 209
observations for estimation, leaving 28 observations, extending from December 2002 to
March 2005, to evaluate the forecasts.
The top panel of Table 2 reports the results of the grid search. The optimal values
for β E and β x are 0.23 and 0.20, respectively. This means that roughly one-quarter of
the observations were used to construct the smoothed entry value for each data point, and
one-fifth of the observations were used to construct the smoothed exit value. The optimal
lag length L is 14. This means that the optimal forecasting horizon for the model is just
over one year.
The smoothed entry, exit rate, and ISS series are displayed in Figure 3, where
they are superimposed over the raw series. Despite the relatively low bandwidths, the
series appear quite smooth. The key trends in the entry and exit series discussed above
are quite prominent. The smoothed ISS seems to fit quite well, even though it was
computed indirectly from the smoothed entry and exit rate series rather than estimated

11

directly. It achieves its maximum value in January 1994, 14 months before the caseload
peak in March 1995. It achieves its minimum value in November 2002, 12 months
before the recent caseload minimum in November 2003.
Figure 4 displays the smoothed ISS and the caseload. The potential forecasting
power of the ISS is quite evident. For the most part, the ISS looks like the caseload to
come. In principle, one could simply use a 14-month lag of the ISS to forecast the
caseload, although the forecasting regression in general should do a better job.
The results from the forecasting regression are presented in panel B of Table 2.
The optimal predictor of the caseload is a value equal to 92.6 percent of the smoothed
ISS, lagged 14 months, plus 48,037. Both coefficients are quite large in relation to their
standard errors, but since the standard errors do not account for the fact that the smoothed
ISS is pre-estimated, it cannot be assumed that the usual t-statistics have standard
asymptotic normal distributions. It seems likely that the standard errors are too small,
since they neglect the considerable dependence that arises from pre-estimation.
Figure 4 depicts the forecasts. These were constructed by using the grid search
values in Panel A of Table 2 to construct smoothed ISS values for the period December
2002 to March 2005, then using the regression parameters from Panel B to construct
both point and interval forecasts 14 months in the future. In Figure 4, the caseload data
used in estimation are represented as solid circles; the point forecasts are represented by
the solid curve. Upper and lower 95 percent predication intervals are represented by
dashed curves. Because these are based on the conventionally-computed standard error
of the forecasting regression, they neglect the additional source of error that arises from
the pre-estimated regressor. Thus they are probably optimistic, meaning that the true

12

confidence intervals should be wider. The actual values of the caseload for the period
December 2002 to March 2005 are represented by open gray circles.
One feature of the forecasts is that they appear to be too low. For most of the
post-estimation period, the forecasts cluster around the upper end of the 95 percent
prediction interval rather than the middle. On average, the forecasts are low by about
18,200 cases, or about 4 percent of the average number of cases over the period.
At the same time, the model does a reasonably good job at predicting the turning
point that appears toward the end of the sample period. The forecasts achieve their
minimum value in January 2004, just two months after the caseload achieved its
minimum value. Furthermore, the forecasts strongly suggest that the November 2003
low point represents a true turning point, rather than just a relatively minor fluctuation
around a stable level. After the beginning of 2004, the forecasted caseload rises sharply.
Table 3 presents quarterly forecasts for the 14-month period following the end of
the sample period. Values in columns (1) to (3) are those depicted in Figure 5; that is,
they are constructed from estimates based on pre-December-2002 data. The point
forecasts rise by 12 percent over this period, from 461,745 to 516,210. The interval
forecast for the end date, May 2006, runs from 497,075 to 535,344. Relative to the
March 2005 value of about 463,000 cases, this represents growth of 7.4 to 15.6 percent.
Of course, in a real forecasting setting, one would use all the data at one’s
disposal to generate predictions of the future caseload. This suggests constructing
forecasts based on estimates obtained over the full sample period that ends in March
2005. Furthermore, comparing estimates based on different sample periods allows one to
assess the stability of the forecasts.

13

Full-sample forecasts are shown in columns (4) through (6) of Table 3. At the
beginning of the forecast period, the two sets of point forecasts differ by about 8,000
cases, or about 2 percent of the forecasted caseload. By the end of the forecast period,
the forecasts are more similar, differing only by about 3,000 cases. Throughout the
forecast period, the reported forecast intervals overlap to a considerable extent, indicating
the true forecast intervals must overlap to an even greater extent. Thus the forecasts are
fairly stable; adding nearly two-and-a-half years of new data has a relatively small effect
on the forecasts, even though those data come largely from the period after the turning
point had been reached. Both sets of forecasts predict that the California welfare
caseload should grow fairly substantially by May 2006.
V. Conclusions
With the passage of PRWORA, states bear the risk associated with their welfare
programs. Federal funding is now provided via a block grant. If the caseload were to
grow dramatically, states could be forced to reconfigure their programs, reduce spending
on other programs, or raise taxes. Accurate caseload forecasts cannot change the growth
rate of the caseload, but they should help reduce surprises, which in turn should reduce
any fiscal dislocations that arise from caseload growth.
The Markov forecasting method proposed above provides analysts with a new
tool to forecast caseloads. It is fairly accurate and reasonably stable. Perhaps most
importantly, it handles turning points well. Based on data that ended a year before the
most recent turning point, the model forecast an increase in the California caseload
beginning in January 2003, only two months after the caseload actually reached its recent
minimum.

14

Although the method has been illustrated with welfare data, the technique is more
broadly applicable. It can be used to forecast any variable that can be thought of as the
accumulation of entries into and exits from a program. It should be useful in forecasting
not only welfare caseloads, but also Food Stamp, foster care, and Medicaid caseloads.
There are a number of ways one might extend the analysis to produce more useful
and potentially more accurate forecasts. One is to generalize the model by allowing for
higher-order Markov chains. If exit rates vary by spell length, and spell lengths vary in
predictable ways, then higher-order models may provide more accurate forecasts. To
allow exit rates to vary by spell lengths requires household level data, however, which
may not be as readily available as the aggregate data on entries and exits which can be
used to estimate the first-order models described above.
Another extension would be to combine the econometric approach to forecasting
with the Markov approach. The way to do this would be to model entries and exit rates
econometrically as a function of variables such as benefit levels, eligibility rules, and
economic conditions. One could use such a model to forecast changes in entries and exits
as a function of changes in those variables, then use the forecasted entries and exits to
construct Markov forecasts of the caseload.
There is a sense in which this exercise is unnecessary. Ultimately, all changes in
economic or policy conditions must affect the caseload by affecting either entries or exits.
Thus the effect of such changes will be implicitly captured by the approach outlined
above, even if they are not explicitly modeled. At the same time, it is often helpful to
explain forecasts in terms of the reasons for the observed changes, so combining the
Markov approach with econometric forecasting may increase the utility of the forecasts.
