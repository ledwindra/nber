     Three    recent papers measure the marginal     excess burden of labor

taxes in the United States.        They obtain very different results even

where they all use a zero uncompensated       labor supply elasticity and

assume that the additional revenue is spent on a public good that is

separable     in utility.   The impression is that other parameters must

                             in results.
explain the differences

     Yet each paper uses a different concept of excess burden.         Nere, I

calculate     all three measures   in one model and show how conceptual

differences explain the results.        Only one of these measures   isolates

the distortionary     effects of taxes in a way that depends on the

compensatedlsbor supply elasticity.         The other two measures incorporate

income effects and thus depend on the actual change in labor.          This

result was obscured because those papers report positive marginal excess

burden even with a zero uncorspensated labor supply elasticity.         This

paper shows conditions      under which their measure is zero, and it


 interprets    the measures in light of recent literature.

     Much of welfare economics has been plagued by differences                  in the

concepts used to measure changes in consumer welfare.              One example of this


problem is presented in striking clarity by the case of a wage tax when the

uncompensated labor supply is vertical,             that is, when labor is inelastic.

Three recent papers in the American Economic Review consider this case, but

they reach very different       conclusions.

     All three papers calculate the "marginal excess burden" of a dollar of

additional tax revenue in the case where labor is inelastic and where the

           dollar is spent on a public good that is separable            in utility.
marginal

Their results are summarized in Table          1.     Charles Stuart   (1984) builds a

simple two-sector      general equilibriummodel and finds in this case that

"marginal excess burden" is 7 cents.           Charles Ballard, John Shoven, and John

Whalley (1985) use a more complicatedgeneral equilibriummodel where their

"marginal excess burden" is 12 cents.           Edgar Browning    (1987) employs         a

simple partial equilibrium        model and obtains a corresponding         figure of 21

cents.     He   concludes   that "almost all of the differences        in results can be

traced to different assumptions about key parameter values" (p.11).

     Certainly      the results are sensitive to assumptions about the marginal

tax rate, the degree of progressiviry,          the use of the revenue, and the

compensated and uncompensared        labor supply elasticities.        As   I   show in this


paper, however,      almost all of the differences        in these cited results can be

rraced to differences        in their definitions      of marginal excess burden.

     These three papers have been discussed             in other papers that introduce

new models and further definitions.1           Some confusion    remains, so one purpose

of this paper is to clarify the different definitions and reconcile the

return to the exact model of Stuart, replicate his result, and add calculs-

tions for the other two definitions       of marginal excess butden O4EB).2 I also

show how Stuart's general equilibrium model reduces to Browning's partial

equilibrium model.      Thus I am ahle to show all three measures in Btowning's

model as well.       The first section relates these three papers to some others

in the literature.       The second section illustrates the different concepts of

welfare,    and the third section performs the actual calculations.



I.   Discussion

      The standard public finance textbook defines excess burden of a wage

tax as the difference between consumet welfare under that tax and under a

lump sum tax with the same revenue (e.g. Harvey Rosen, 19B5, Joseph

Stiglitz,    198).     Synonyms   include welfare cost, efficiency cost, or dead-

weight loss.      In the literature, much discussion involves the choice of

consumer welfare measure.3         For a change from the original equilibriumwith

a pra-existing wage tax, Stuart uses the compensatingsurplus (CS), Ballard,

Shoven, and Whalley use the equivalentvariation          (EV), and Browning uses the

compensatingvariation (CV).          Together with the equivalent surplus (ES)

 these constitute "The Four Consumer's      Surpluses"   of Sit John Hicks (1943),
                                                                   -
 as renamed in Hicks (1954).




 °Stuart  (1984) and Ballard (19B7) perform two kinds of policy experiments.
 Using Ballard's terms, revenue is spent by government in a "balanced-budget"
 experiment, and it is returned as a lump sum transfer in a "differential"
 experiment.   Here, I consider only one experiment and calculate different
 measures.   Balanced budget spending is the only experiment that appears in
 all three papers, but that one equilibrium outcome is described very
 differentlyby the three burden measures.

each   otherA The big       difference   among the three papers        that I review is

introduced     by the revenue figure subtracted.       Browning subtracts          the change

difference by       the actual change    in revenue (dR).    His   Y1EB    is    (CV-dR )/dR.

Stuart subtracts       the actual change in revenue and calculates (CS-dR)/dR.

Ballard,      Shoven, and Whalley calculate      (RV-dR)/dR.5      Because      the welfare

measures       CS   and EV are numerically close for small changes, the latter

two    !1EB    measures   are always similar in my results below.

       Given the textbook definitionof total excess burden, a corresponding

concept at the margin would compare the increment in the wage tax to a small

lump sum tax with the same revenue (Auerbach,          l9BS).      Only Browning's

concept of "marginal excess burden" corresponds to this definition.                    His

measure depends on the matginal tax rate and on the compensatedlabot supply

elasticity.         It is positive in the special case where labor is "inelastic,"

so he would answer that the tax is still distorting.               Unfortunately,      though,

Browning      leaves   the incorrect impressionthat the cost-benefit analyst

should use one plus his marginal excess burden (l+MEB)                  as the marginal

cost of funds (MCF).         This MCF     can be defined as the change in consumer

welfare (CS, EV, or CV) divided by the actual change in revenue (dR).                       In

the case where labor does not change, the           HCF equals one.5



'Mayshar      (l9BBb) provides   a formal proof of   their   equivalence at the margin.
5They never state this expressionexplicitly, however, so others misunder-
stand what was calculated. Triest (19BB) assumes that this MEB is measured
in pre-tax prices, when it is actually in prices of the original cue-tax
equilibrium.  Mayshar (l9BBb) introduces tV-dR as a "new" measure, not
knowing that this is the measure of Ballard, Shaven, and Whalley.
 6This result is in Anthony Atkinson and Nicholas Stern             (1974), Stuart (1982),
                                              -4-



     The best intuition for this result derives from Atkinson                     and Stern

(1974).   They isolate three reasons to deviate from the conventional rule of

Paul Samuelson     (1954) that the sum of the marginal          rates of substiturion

(MRS) should equal the marginal rare of rransformarion                   (MRT).    The first

modification    is that revenue may be affected by any complemenrarityor


substitutability      between the public project and the taxed good.                All three

papers ignore this possibility.             Second, the rule is modified          if taxes are

not lump sum.    This "disrortionary effecr" of Atkinson and Stern is measured

by Browoing'spaper.           Third,   the rule is modified    for income effects that

change the amount of the taxed good.            This "revenue effect" of Atkinson and

Stern exactly offsets the disrorrionary effect in the special case where

actual labor does not change.           The project is worthwhile if          XMRS>MRT,       which

means that the       MCF—1.

     The measures of Stuart and of Ballard, Shoven, and Whalley effectively

combine the disrorrionary          effect and the revenue effect.          As can be seen

from the above formulas, they define "marginal excess burden" as the

marginal cost of funds minus one.7             With this definition,       the cost-benefit

analyst        use    (l+MEB)      as the    MCF.    In the special case where labor does

not change and the MCF—1, however, this               1155   is zero.     Because of the

terminology    of excess burden, they leave the incorrect impressionthat the

tax is not "distorting."            The wage tax    j disrorring in the conventional
sense that it leaves consumers worse off than a lump sum tax.

      In addition, with        a   pre-exisring wage tax and      1155    defined as      MCF-l,


David Wildasin (1954), Ballard (19B7), Triest (1985), Mayshar (1988a,b), and
others. Also, Wildasin shows that Browning ceuld use l+MEB    for the MCF
if he had assumed that the public good has no effect on compensated labor
supply.  Instead, Browning assumes no effect on actual labor supply.

7Papers that use similar definitions include Stuart (1982), Ballard (1987),
Ahmed and Croushore (1988), and Mayshar (19881), among others.
a lump sum tax increment has a negative "marginal excess burden"                The lump

sum increment has no distortionaryeifect, hut it has a revenue eifect

because it reduces disposable       income and thus causes an increase        in labor

subject to the wage tax.

     For these reasons,        some say that    MCF-l    should not be called "marginal

excess burden" but should instead be called "marginal welfare cost,"               (e.g.

Ballard, 1987) or "marginal efficiencycost" (e.g. David Bizer and Stuart,

1987).     These terms are generally     regarded as synonyms, however.

     I   conclude that    MCF-l     should not be used to define        g   concept like

marginal excess burden, welfare cost, efficiency cost, or deadweightloss.

All such definitions      leave the incorrect impression that the wage tax is not

distorting.      The marginal cost of funds is the relevant concept in any case,

so the cost-benefit      analyst must simply add back the one subtracted.

     Finally,     the fundamental difference among the three definitions of

"marginal     excess burden"    is obscured    by the   fact that Stuart (1984) reports

7 cents and Ballard, Shoven, and Whalley report 12 cents, even though the

uncompensared labor supply elasticityis zero.               Ballard (1987) shows that

 this measure of "MEB" is zero in a simple model when the uncompensated labor

 supply elasticity is zero, and he concludes that complications in the models

 (discussed below)    lead to non-zero    results.       As shown in Stuart   (1982) and

 Mayshar    (1988b), however,    the condition for       MCF'l   (or that this "MEB"—O)    is


 not that the uncompensated       elasticity be zero but that actual labor supply

 be unchanged.     In more general models, labor supply can be affected by

 income and by prices other than the net wage.             In simulations   below, using

 the model of Stuart, I show that a non-zero            uncoopensated   labor supply


 elasticitycan exactly offset these other income and price changes such that

 the actual labor supply is unchanged and this "MiS" is zero.
II. Concepts     of Excess Burden

     Figure 1 depicts the choice between leisure (ou the horizontal axis)

and labor which earns units of the numeraire good denoted in dollars (on the

vertical axis).      A proportional tax on     labor pivots the budget around its

horizontal   intercept,     to a flatter line marked "new prices.'        In the special

case of inelastic       labor, the new choice point B must lie directly below the

initial point A.        Tax revenue is this vertical distance, AB, in dollars.

Government is assumed to spend the revenue in a manner that does not affect

the labor-leisure       choice, so the public good is separable       in utility.

     The equivalent variation, distance AC in the diagram, is the number of

dollars taken away from the consumer at old prices that would reduce utility

by an   amount    "equivalent" to the tax.     Since   AC exceeds   revenue AB, the

excess burden is BC (Kay, 1980).        The compensatingvariation, distance DF,

is the number of dollars at new prices that would "compensate"             for the tax

and raise utility back to the old level.          Excass burden in this case is       OF
sinus EF, the revenue that would occur at new prices if the consumer                ir
compensated (Diamond and McFadden, 1974).          Using the two variation measures,
excess burden is related to       a compensatedchange in      labor supply.

     The less commonly used compensatingsurplus is the amount of the

numeraire    good that must be added to the consumer's new bundle to reach the

old utility,      the distance   from B back to A.     The consumer may not re-

optimize.      Stuart   (1982) notes that both the      MET and ZMES      are measured

in terms of      a particular cosssodity and   that the compensatingsurplus can

measure welfare in the same commodity.8          The compensating surplus is exactly



tIt is perfectly consistent, however, to measure costs and benefits of the
public project by income equivalents and use the EV. Besides, Slutsky
equal to revenue         in this case, so Stuart's measure of excess burden is zero.

Using this measure with inelastic labor, the tax is entirely                      nondistotting.

His measure yields zero 'marginal excess burden" in this model.                       The reason

he obtains 7 cents is explained below,               but in general his marginal excess

burden is related to the actual change in labot supply.

          In contrAst, Browning follows the standard approach.                  The wage tax is

still distortingeven though labor supply does not change, because a lump

sum tax with the same revenue would leave the consumer on a higher

indifference curve.           Browning's   actual calculations can be described using

Figure 2, where the gross wage is fixed at                w.    The marginal      tax rare    a

may exceed the average tax rare             t.   The initial net wage is           w(l-m°),   and

labor supply is                Initial excess burden is rho area ABC, the area
                         L.
between the tax wedge AC and the compensatedlabor supply curve                        S.      When
the marginal          tax rate is increased by       dm (—m' -m°), this measure of excess

burden increases by the shaded area, ACCE. Actual labor supply is still
 0                             *
    but compensated labor is
                              L1. The change in excess burden is:


                                                                        *
                  ACUE — ACHE      -
                                       (EDFH-ACFC)      — CV   -   dR       ,                     (1)


where ACHE is the compensating             variation,   EDFH is the revenue at the new

rate       m'   when the consumer is compensated, and ACFC is the revenue at the

old rate        m0.     In other words, the change in excess burden is the CV minus
  *
dR    ,   the   change tn revenue measured at marginal rates along the compensated

curve.       This formula corresponds to Auerbach (l9g5, p.72).

          Alternatively,      with no initial tax, excess burden can be defined as the

equivalent variation      minus actual revenue.            This measure also compares     the

wage tax to    a   lump sum tax.    With a pre-exisringwage tax, however, the

correspondingconcept at the margin would compare                 a   small additional wage

tax to an equal-yieldlump sum increment.           Auerbach (1985, p.72) shows that

such a measure also requires a calculationof the change in revenue along a

compensated curve.       This point could be demonstratedusing a figure that

looks just like Figure 2, except that consumers                are held to the         utility

level along           when m°      is raised to   m'   .     Then ACHE is the equivalent

variation,    and         is the change in revenue using marginal               rates while

holding to the new utility.         The change in excess burden is ACDE.              Thus the

CV and     EV measures converge as the tax change gets very small.

     For total excess burden, Ballard, Shoven and Whalley use the equivalent

variation,    and they subtract actual revenue.              For "marginal excess burden,"

however,   they subtract the actual change in revenue rather than the change

along a compensatedcurve.           Thus their "marginal excess burden" is not the

increase     in their total excess burden for a small increase in the tax.                    In

fact, for the simple model of Figure 1, they would get large total excess

burden and (approximately) zero "marginal excess burden."

      To see this point, consider a small wage tax with no other distortions

in Figure 1.        When the equivalent variation AC and the revenue AB are both

arbitrarilysmall, the excess burden BC is approximately                    zero.   Only as the

tax becomes large does the excess burden become noticeable.                     How reinterpret

Figure 1 so that "old prices" represent a large pre-exisringwage tax, and

"new prices" indicate a small additional tax.                 Then the equivalentvariation

AC and the actual change in revenue AB are still arbitrarily small.                     The

difference,     BC, is the "marginal excess burden"            of    Ballard,   Shoven, and

Whalley.      It is near zero for the same reason that the excess burden of a
small tax is near zero, as if they ignore the pre-existing tax.

       Thus Ballard, Shoven, and Whalley use a measure that yields zero

"marginal       excess burden"        in this simple model with inelastic labor.                 The

reason they obtain 12 cents is discussed below.



III. The Calculation of Marginal                   Excess Burden
                                                                                         *
       For   the change in excess burden,                   Browning assumes that       S    is linear

and calculates the shaded area of Figure 2.                         Thfs assumptionis unimportant,

however,     because      S       only needs       to be approximately        lindmr over a small

range.     Thus the ares           (CV.dR*)        is                                 The compensated

supply     L      does not change.            If    dt is the change in averagm tax rate,

then                     is the actual change in revenue.                  Thus Browning calculates:9

        The parameter         dm/dr        indicates      the progressivity        of the tax change.

Assuming     that the change maintains                  progressivity,     dm/dt     is the same as

r—m/t      in Stuart's paper.              Browning      sets the initial      m—.43     and t—. 31, so

dm/dt      is    1.39.     He also sets            dm—.01     and    9—0.2, so equation      (2) yields

21 cents for "marginal excess burden" as shown in Table 1.                              The measure in




 °Browning prefers his other case, where government spending restores the
 original utility level and thus has an income effect on labor supply. This
 other case is not the same as Stuart's other case where the revenue is
 returned lump sum (since the latter is not enough to reach the old utility).
 I use the case where public spending has no effect on labor, because it is
 the only case consideredby all three papers.

dm/dt, and the compensated                elasticity             rj.



       To substitute Stuart's parameters,                          set     m—.427,    t—.273, and         r—l.544.

The   "liES"   from equation (2) is then 24 cents as shown in Table                                 1.    Thus the

difference      in published results is not due to parameters.'°

       To calculate his "marginal excess burden' in a general equilibrium

model, Stuart first assumes that a single aggregate consumer                                       has an

endowment       L        that can be supplied to th€ market sector as labor                                     or

used in home production as leisure                         L2:



                                                                                                                     (3)

''Equations (B) and (9) follow Varian (19B4, p.264), where the LV and CV
are both positive for a utility gain. Note that E(P' ,U') is equal to I',
so the LV in (B) is -[E(P' ,U')-E(P°,U')] + (I?I0). In other words, it
includes both the change in consumer surplus and the change in money income.
The LV in Auerbach (1965) is only the change in consumer surplus. These
definitions differ here because money income changes. To help clarify this
distinction, the concepts in (8) and (9) are called the "equivalent gain"
and "compensating gain" by King (1983).

burden" is 7 cents, just ss in published                   results.        Table 1 shows that the

measure of Ballard,       Shoven, and Whalley is also 7 cents.                      Using the same

               outcome, however,       Browning's          measure is 25 ceuts.             Thus the
equilibrium

results differ because the measurer             differ.

     When labor is inelastic in Figure                1,    Stuart's measure was shown to


provide zero excess burden.           So why does he get 7 cents?                   The reason is that

this simulation in his model with a zero uncoispensated labor elasticity does

not lead to zero change       in actual labor suppl\.

     Ballard (198?) gets zero "marginal excess burden" in a similar model

with a flat wage tax, and he concludes that Stuart did not get zero because

of progressivity.         It is true that this change in the progressive tax

structure effectivelychanges           the "virtual"             income of the consumer,          but the

point here is that this "MEg" will not be zero whenever any aspect of the

reform causes a change in income or in other prices that leads to a general

equilibriumresponse in the quantity of labor.

     To sec his parameters, Stuart differentiates                       labor supply with respect

 to the net wage and imposes three conditions:                     the uncnmpensated labor supply

 elasticity is zero, the compensated             'i       is     .2, and the initial         F2
                                                                                                  is I.

 The implied     6   is    1968.36,    a   is    .9429, and            p    is    1.0625.     This

 procedure    is consistent with the definition                  of an elasticity,          since the

 differentiation     varies only the net wage and holds all other prices

 constant.     As an alternative procedure, I search a three-dimensional                           grid

 for values of 6, m, and        p     that satisfy three conditions                  for this

 simulation in general equilibrium:             ,     —
                                                           .2,    F   — 1, and actual labor does

 not change.     The resulting parameters are                    6—1720.44,      m—.9300,    and p—2.2lBO.

 In this case the same one percent increase in m                           leaves actual labor un-


 changed,    and the Table shows that Stuart's measure is exactly zero.
                                      -13-



      These new parameters   should not be preferred to Stuart's.      Indeed, they

imply that the uncompensated labor supply elasticity        is not exactly zero.

They are used here only to clarify rhe important conceptual point that

Stuart's measure   is zero when actual labor supply does not change.       This

point was obscured in Stuart's paper because readers naturally        thought that

his 7 cent figure was comparable    to Browning's 21 cent figure.

      Using these new parameters, the measure of Ballard, Shoven, and Whalley
is also zero.   So why do they get 12 cents?     Their uncompensated    elasticity

is similarly set to zero in a model with progressive        taxes and with varying

prices, so their actual labor supply also changes.         In addition, as pointed

our by Ballard (1987), they have other taxes that introduce second-best

effects.   The simulation here demonstrates that they would find zero

"marginal excess burden" if they reduced their model to one consumer,        two

sectors, no other taxes, and unchanged supply of labor.'2

      The model of Ballard, Shoven, and Whalley is net used here to calculate
                                                                                  *
the   three different measures.   The reason is that the calculation of dR

would be extremely difficult in a model with many tax instruments.         It would

require net only the compensated labor supply, but also the compensated

demand for each coenodity,    the sales tax on each compensated     quantity, and

all factor taxes on producers     at those quantities.'3

       As shown in Table 1, the use of these new parameters reduces all three


'2The point of this paper does not arise when their measure is used in a
revenue neutral reform, as in every previous application of their model.
They use (B), the "equivalent gain" of King (1981).
'3Hansson and Stuart (1988) point out this difficulty with the Browning
measure.  In this case, one could solve numerically for the lump sum tax
that is "equivalent" in terms of utility to the simulated tax change. irh
more consumers, however, one needs to solve for more "equivalent" tax
amounts.  Alternatively, the revenue could be returned as lump sum gifts
while jusr using the CV or EV. In Stuart's model, with one consumer,
this alternative is extremely close to the Browning measure.
                                            - 14-


measures    of marginal excess burden.        While     the first two fall from 7 cents

to zero, Browning's measure falls from 25 cents to 20 cents.

      Finally,    I   impose partial equilibrium conditions on Stuart's model by

setting     a—A—b—B—l.     In this case,                and             so the consumer's
                                             Y1—L1             Y2—L2,

problem reduces to that of Figure 1.            An additional        grid search is performed

to impose the three conditions        discussed above          ('7—2,   P-l, and   actual labor

unchanged).      The necessary utility parameters             are   6—2052.31,   o—.7420,    and

p—.SSlO.      In this case, Stuart's model reduces exactly to Browning's model.

Table 1 shows that Browning's 9IEB" is 24 cents while the other measures are

zero.      Browning's partial equilibriummodel therefore                overstates his own 14EB

by   20 percent relative      to a comparable       general equilibrium      model.



IV. Conclusion

        In all of these calculations,       the compensatingand equivalent

variations are very close to the compensating surplus.                     In Figure   1,   the

vertical distance between the two indifference curves is always close to the

distance     between two parallel price lines.       The big difference is introduced
                                                                  *
by   the revenue figure subtracted.         Browning subtracts  dR and thus compares

the distorting tax increase to a lump sum increment with the same revenue.

The other two measures are always similar to each other because they both

subtract the actual change in revenue.               These other measures        are zero in

Stuart's     model when actual labor supply is unchanged.

        With only the distortionary        effect, Browning's        "marginal excess burden"

 is a familiar     concept.    It is analogous to a concept of total excess burden

 that compares     the whole tax to a lump sum tax.             However,    it is not enough

 information     to set public spending.        Wirh the addition of the revenue

effect,     the other two measures    do provide enough information              to decide on a
                                           -15-



project    that is separable in utility.          Because they are zero for a

distorting tax, however,       they should not be called marginal        excess burden,

welfare cost,    efficiency   cost, or deadweight      loss.    They are defined as the

marginal   cost of funds minus one, but there is really no need for any

concept other than the        MGF    itself.   Given the tax used to fund it, the

project    is worthwhile if tho benefits       exceed the      MGF.

     An    important   implication    Is that the decision      to fund a public project

depands irrevocablyon the nature of the project.               The assumption that the

project has no effect on labor supply may be convenient, but it is unlikely

to be valid.     The best procedure is to specify the particular project in the

utility of consumers,      including any complementarity         to labor or leisure,   and

then calculate    whether the tax and spending package increases welfare.

consumption, but they differ on other assumptions.

b. The other assumptions borrowed from Stuart's model are: q—.2 for the
compensated labor supply elasticity; a—.427 for the marginal tax rate;
and r—da/dr—l.S64 for the constant ratio of the marginal tax rate to
the average tax rate.

c. It is not possible to use the same assumptions in the Eallard-Shoven-

Whalley model, for reasons described in the text.

Appendix:    General Equilibrium          Welfare Effecrs

        In Stuart's      model, rhe only tax is on labor in the market sector.

Total    revenue is split between redistributions,                  Tr, and government      spending,

C.    Marginal revenue is spent only on C, so:



                C—       g0+   twL1                                                                 (Al)

        From sources in the literature, Stuart sets the initial                      m—,427 ond

        Stuart makes a small error in reporting that g0 is -63,1, but the

correct value only changes his marginal                 excess burden slightly.

        To add calculations for the compensating and equivalent variations,                          it

is convenient to reformulate              the model    in terms oi demands:
                                                -A2 -



              —   a                +(l-a)                                and                             (A3)
                      (l.P26)/[a            P2
              —   S   +   ()J(3pfl/pCIUy)CpiC]                                                           (p.4)




Substitutionback into (6) yields the indirect utility function:



    V(?I) — (I-P28)/E where                 E   —
                                                    t+(i.o)mP2l0])                    .                  (A5)



P is the composite price, an index of                        and    2'     Solution       for    I


yields the the expenditure         function         E(P,U) — UP    + 8P2.

     To calculate Browning's measure using this model, I follow Auerbach
                             *           0                            V

between the new producer price and the new consumer price all times the

compensated    quantity,     and   R°   is the old price differenoe times the old
                                                                          0-

            in equation (A4),       Production               equals that demand.           Hext      I   use

                                                                                Taxable     labor
