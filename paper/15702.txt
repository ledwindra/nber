ABSTRACT
This paper uses the sequence of government budget constraints to motivate estimates of interest payments
on the U.S. Federal government debt. We explain why our estimates differ conceptually and quantitatively
from those reported by the U.S. government. We use our estimates to account for contributions to
the evolution of the debt to GDP ratio made by inflation, growth, and nominal returns paid on debts
of different maturities.

Introduction

This paper shows the contributions that nominal interest payments, the maturity composition of
the debt, inflation, and growth in real GDP have made to the evolution of the U.S. debt to GDP
ratio since World War II. Among the questions we answer are these. Did the U.S. inflate away
much of the debt by using inflation to pay negative real rates of return? Sometimes, but not
usually. Did high net-of-interest deficits send the debt-GDP ratio upward? Substantially during
World War II, but not too much after that. How much did growth in GDP help contribute to
holding down the debt GDP ratio? A lot. How much did the variation in returns across maturities
affect the evolution at the debt to GDP ratio? At times substantially, but on average not much
since the end of World War II.
Our answers to these questions rely on our own accounting scheme and not the U.S. government’s.1 Our accounting emerges from a decomposition of the government’s period-by-period
budget constraint, to be described in section 2 and justified in detail in appendix A. We use
prices of indexed and nominal debt of each maturity to construct one-period holding period yields
on government IOU’s of various maturities. Multiplying the vector of returns by the vector of
quantities outstanding each period then gives us the appropriate concept of interest payments
that appears in the government budget constraint.
Unfortunately, the government’s interest payments series fails to measure the concept that
appears in the government budget constraint, the equation that determines the evolution of the
debt to GDP ratio. Appendix B describes how the government’s measure ignores capital gains and
losses on longer term government obligations, an error that is revealed by the absence of holding
period yields for longer maturity government obligations in what we think is the government’s
formula for interest payments. The government creates its estimate of interest by summing all
coupon payments and adding to that sum a one-period holding period yield times all principal
repayments. The government could drive that measure of interest payments to zero every period
by perpetually rolling over, let us say, zero-coupon 10 year bonds. Such bonds would never pay
coupons and never mature: each period they would be repurchased as nine year zero-coupon
bonds and reissued as fresh 10 year zero-coupon bonds. Though the government accounts would
put interest payments at zero, the government would still pay interest in the economically relevant
sense determined by the government budget constraint.

Interest payments in the government budget constraint

Let Yt be real GDP at t and let Bt be the real value of government IOU’s owed the public. That
least controversial equation of macroeconomics, the government budget constraint, accounts for
how a nominal interest rate r̃t−1,t , net inflation πt−1,t , net growth in real GDP gt−1,t , and the
net-of-interest deficit def t combine to determine the evolution of the government debt-GDP ratio:
Bt−1 def t Bt−1
Bt
= (r̃t−1,t − πt−1,t − gt−1,t )

The appropriate concept of a nominal return r̃t−1,t is one that verifies this equation.2
The nominal yield r̃t−1,t and the real stock of debt Bt in equation (1) are averages of pertinent
objects across terms to maturity. To bring out some of the consequences of interest rate risk and
the maturity structure of the debt for the evolution of the debt-GDP ratio, we refine equation (1)
to recognize that the government pays different nominal one-period holding period returns on
j
j
the IOUs of different maturities that compose Bt . Thus, let Bt−1
and B̄t−1
be the real values
P
j
of nominal and indexed zero coupon bonds of maturity j at t − 1, while Bt−1 = nj=1 Bt−1
and
Pn
j
j
B̄t−1 = j=1 B̄t−1 are the total real values of nominal and indexed debt at t − 1; let r̃t−1,t be the
net nominal holding period yield between t − 1 and t on nominal zero-coupon bonds of maturity
j
j; let r̄t−1,t
be the net real holding period yield between t − 1 and t on inflation indexed zero
coupon bonds of maturity j.3 Then the government budget constraint expresses the following law
of motion for the debt-GDP ratio:

Notice how equation (2) distinguishes contributions to the growth of the debt-GDP ratio that
depend on debt maturity j from those that don’t. Thus, πt−1,t and gt−1,t don’t depend on j and
j
j
and r̄t−1,t
operate on the total real value of debt last period; but the holding period yields r̃t−1,t
j
and
do depend on maturity j and operate on the real values of the maturity j components Bt−1
j
B̄t−1 .
Section 3 describes the behavior of holding period yields across maturities. Section 4 then
displays the outcome of our accounting exercise by decomposing the evolution of the ratio of
debt to GDP into components coming from inflation, growth in real GDP, nominal yields, and
the maturity composition of the debt. Appendix A describes the data and the theory of the
term structure of interest rates that we use to construct components of the government budget
constraint (2). Appendix B compares our estimates of interest payments on the U.S. government
debt to quite different estimates reported by the Federal government. Appendix B also reverse

The nominal value of interest payments from the government to the public is t−1,tYt−1
where pt−1 is the
price level at t − 1. Unfortunately, the U.S. government reports something that it calls ‘interest payments’ as a
r̃
pt−1 Bt−1
component of Federal expenditures, but this is not the same as the term t−1,tYt−1
that belongs in (1). As we
discuss in appendix B, what the government reports presumably was designed to answer some question, but that
question is not “what is the appropriate interest payment to record in order to account properly for the motion
through time of the real government debt owed to the public?”
3
In a nonstochastic version of the standard growth model that is widely used in macroeconomics and public
finance, the net holding period yield on debt is identical for zero-coupon bonds of all maturities (e.g., see Ljungqvist
and Sargent, 2011, chapter 11). The presence of risk and possibly incomplete markets changes that.

engineers the question that the official government interest series seemingly answers, though we
confess limited success in making sense of that question. To help bring out the quantitative
significance of the interest rate risk that confronts the government and its creditors, appendix
C constructs counterfactual series for the evolution of the debt/GDP series under alternative
hypothetical debt-management policies the choice among which would have no impact on the
evolution of the debt-GDP ratio in a world without interest rate risk.

Risk and return across maturities

To set the stage for the role that interest rate risks will play in our story, for various maturities
j measured in years, figure 1 shows contributions to the propulsion of B/Y in formula (1) from
Bj

j
t−1
nominal interest payments r̃t−1,t
Yt−1 . The figure shows that volatility of nominal interest rate
payments has been larger for longer horizons. For the period 1942-2008, figure 2 plots average
one-year real holding period while figure 3 plots the standard deviation of the one-year real holding
by maturity.4,5 Figure 2 reveals that while longer maturities have generally been associated with
higher and more volatile returns, returns on bonds maturing in 15, 20 and 30 years were on
average lower than those for adjacent maturities. This outcome reflects investors’ preferences for
newly issued or so-called ‘on the run’ securities.
Figure 4 plots the average maturity, in years, of the Treasury debt held by the public. Immediately after World War II, the average maturity of the government portfolio was approximately 7
years. Over the next three decades, it fell steadily, reaching a trough in the mid-1970s at around
2 years. In the 1960s and early 1970s this fall is partly the consequence of federal legislation,
repealed in 1975, which prevented the Treasury from issuing long-term instruments paying interest above a threshold rate, that market rates exceeded during that period. As we shall see, by
causing the Treasury to shorten the average maturity of its debt during the high inflation years
of the 1970s, this law prevented the government from fully benefiting from the negative implicit
real interest it managed to pay through inflation. Since the repeal of this restriction, the Treasury
has lengthened the maturity the average maturity to between 3 and 4 years.

Contributions to the evolution of the U.S. debt-GDP ratio

Figure 5 reports the ratio of the market value of U.S. Treasury debt to GDP from 1941 to 2008.6
In 1941, this ratio was 29.6 and in 1945 it stood at 66.2 percent. It fell steadily over the next

A principal aim of stochastic discount factor models like the one proposed by Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) is
to capture how means and standard deviations of one-period holding period yields depend on maturity.
5
TIPS are not included in the holding period yields in these graphs.

Figure 5 plots the ratio of the end of the calendar year total market value of interest-bearing marketable
Treasury securities held by private investors to GDP. This measure of government debt is narrower than other
Federal debt series sometimes reported. It does not include nonmarketable securities (e.g. savings bonds, special
issues to state and local governments), securities held by other government entities (e.g. the Federal Reserve or the
Social Security Trust Fund), or agency debt (e.g. Tennessee Valley Authority). Further each security is valued at
market prices rather than par values. See appendix A for a complete description of how this series was constructed.

three decades, reaching a trough in 1974 at 11.3 percent. After the deficits of the 1980s, it peaked
again in 1993 at 42 percent. It fell below 30 percent during the Clinton administration, but by
December 2008 it had climbed back to 37.8 percent.

Figure 8 plots the inflation rate, the growth rate of real GDP, and the value weighted return on
the government’s debt portfolio. For the first half of the sample, the growth rate of GDP exceeded
the return on the debt, while in the second half of the sample, the return on the government debt
exceeded the growth rate.
Table 1 and figures 6, 7, and 8 reveal the following patterns in the way that the U.S. grew,
inflated, and paid its way toward higher or lower B/Y ratios:
1. From 1945 to 1974, the debt to GDP ratio fell from 66.2 to 11.3. Of this 54.9 percentage
drop,
(a) 12.5 was due to negative real returns on debt via inflation. This largely (10.3 out 12.5)
hit the long-term bond holders. The average maturity of the debt was around 7 years
right after WWII.
(b) 21.6 was due to growth in real GDP.
(c) 20.8 was due to running primary surpluses
2. During the 1970s, the U.S. continued to inflate away part of the debt, but the magnitudes
were small.
(a) Long term bond holders received negative real returns, but since there was not much
debt outstanding (B/Y was less than .2) and the average maturity of the debt was low
(around 2 years), the government was unable to nail the long-term bond holders as it
had done immediately after WWII.
(b) B/Y continued to grow during the 1970s in spite of the government inflating away
part of the debt. The causes were insufficiently rapid real GDP growth and primary
deficits.
3. During the Reagan-Bush (41) years (1981-1992),7 the debt to GDP ratio grew from 16.6 in
1982 to 42.0 in 1993– an increase of 25.4 percent.
(a) Almost half of this increase (11.3) came from primary deficits.
(b) Despite strong GDP growth, B/Y grew by more than the primary deficits due to
large real returns paid to bond holders. Returns to long-term bond holders account
for nearly 10.0 of the 25.4 increase. Thus, while long-term bondholders were heavily
taxed by inflation after WWII, they did very well when Volcker brought inflation down
during the early 1980s.

deviation of 4.9 percent. Figure 9 reveals three especially striking outcomes:

3. Annual real returns were considerably more volatile in the period between 1980 and 2006 –
a period of low volatility in GDP growth often described as the Great Moderation.
We see in table 2 that the average growth rate of the real GDP exceeds the sum the average
real return paid to the government’s creditors and the average deficit-to-GDP ratio. Finally it is
interesting to note that since the introduction of TIPS, their returns have on average exceeded
those of the nominal debt. For the TIPS the real return for the period from 1998 to 2008 is 4.3
percent with a standard deviation 7.4. For the nominal portion of the debt over this ten-year
period, the real return was 3.3 percent with a standard deviation 3.7.

Conclusion

From 1946 to 1974, the United States reduced the debt to GDP ratio far below what it had
been immediately after World War II. During these three decades, the U.S. managed to reduce
its debt-to-GDP ratio by 85 percent by a mixture of negative real returns on its bonds, primary
surpluses, and rapidly growing real income. Only about 20 percent of the decline in the debt-GDP
came from using inflation to deliver negative returns to bond-holders. The remaining 80 percent
was split about equally between growth in GDP and running net-of-interest surpluses.
The mix has changed. Since 1974, for the most part, government creditors have on average
been paid positive, though highly volatile, real returns. In particular, during the early 1980s, when,
perhaps unexpectedly, Paul Volcker brought down inflation, government bondholders earned positive real returns that outpaced the growth in real GDP, increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio beyond
what would have been implied by the Reagan-era primary deficits themselves. The debt paydown
9
It is interesting to compare these outcomes with predictions of Lucas and Stokey’s (1983) model of tax smoothing, according to which government debt pays low returns when there are high government expenditure shocks. See
Berndt, Lustig, and Yeltekin (2009) for an empirical study and also Lustig, Sleet, and Yeltekin (2008).

of the 1990s was largely driven by years of primary surpluses with the positive real interest paid
to bondholders roughly offsetting growth in real GDP.
We get these conclusions by manipulating the government’s period-by-period budget constraint. Directly computing real returns on government debts of various maturities lets us accurately measure contributions to the evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, we claim to
have reverse engineered the question answered by the government’s series on interest payments,
whose intertemporal properties differ from ours substantially.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt-to-GDP ratio will return to World
War II levels by the end of 2011 as a consequence of recent large primary deficits and drops in
GDP growth.10 This has reawakened concerns that rising government interest payments could
eventually unleash inflation or other painful fiscal readjustments via ‘unpleasant monetarist arithmetic’ (Sargent and Wallace (1981)).11 A key element of that unpleasant arithmetic is the ratio
of interest payments on the government debt to government expenditures or GDP. So to frame
the tradeoffs and risks facing the United States, it is important to account appropriately for the
substantial interest rate risks that the U.S. government shares with its creditors.

Good accounting

At each date t, we compute the number of dollars the government has promised for each date
t + j in the future. We regard a coupon bond consisting of a stream of promised coupons plus an
ultimate principal payment as a bundle of zero coupon bonds of different maturities. We price
it by unbundling it into a set of component zero-coupon bonds, one for each date at which a
coupon on the bond is due, valuing each such component individually, then adding up the value
of the components. In other words, we strip the coupons from the bond and price the bond as a
weighted sum of zero coupon bonds of maturities j = 1, 2, ..., n. The market and the government
already do this. Prestripped coupon bonds are routinely traded.
We treat nominal bonds and inflation-indexed bonds separately. For nominal bonds, let stt+j
be the number of time t + j dollars that the government has promised to deliver, as of time t.
To compute stt+j from historical data, we add up all of the dollar principal-plus-coupon payments
that the government has promised to deliver at date t + j as of date t. We let s̄tt+j be the number
of inflation protected t + j dollars, or time t + j goods, that the government has promised to
deliver, as of time t.
Since zero-coupon bond prices were not directly observable until prestripped coupon bonds
were introduced in 1985, we extract the nominal implicit forward rates from government bond
price data. We then convert these nominal forward rates on government debt into prices of claims
t
on future dollars. Let qt+j
be the number of time t dollars that it takes to buy a dollar at time
t + j:
t
qt+j

=

1
≈ exp(−jρjt )
(1 + ρjt )j

where ρjt is the time t yield to maturity on bonds with j periods to maturity. The yield curve
t }n , where n is
at time t is a graph of yield to maturity ρjt against maturity j. The vector {qt+j
j=1
the longest maturity outstanding, prices all nominal zero coupon bonds at t. To convert t dollars
to goods we use
vt =

1
pt

where pt is the price level in base year 2005 dollars, and vt is the value of currency measured in
goods per dollar.
For inflation-protected bonds (TIPS), let s̄tt+j be the number of time t + j goods that the
government promises to deliver at time t. For indexed debt, when we add up the principal and
coupon payments that the government has promised to deliver at date t + j as of date t, we must
adjust for past realizations of inflation in ways consistent with the rules governing TIPS.
To compute a real price of a promise, sold at time t, of goods at time t + j, ρ̄jt , we construct
a real yield to maturity as
ρ̄jt = ρjt − πt−1,t

15

where πt−1,t is the inflation rate from t − 1 to t realized at t. We appeal to a random walk model
t ,
for inflation to justify this way of estimating real yields to maturities.12 We then compute q̄t+j
the number of time t goods that it takes to purchase a time t + j good, by:

Data

The price and quantity data for nominal bonds are in the CRSP Monthly Government Bond File.13
The quantity outstanding of the Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are in December

In the CRSP data set the quantity of publicly held marketable debt only goes back to 1960. We extended this
series using data from the Treasury Bulletin.

issues of the U.S Treasury’s Monthly Statement of the Public Debt. For the pre-1970 period, we fit
a zero-coupon forward curve from the coupon bond price data via Daniel Waggoner’s (1997) cubic
spline method. Waggoner fits the zero-coupon one-period forward-rate curve with a cubic spline
employing a set of roughness criteria to reduce oscillations in the approximated curve. For 1970
to 2008, we use the nominal and real zero-coupon yield curves computed by Gurkaynak, Sack and
Wright (2006, 2008). The value of currency vt is the inverse of the fourth quarter observation of
the GDP price deflator.

market value of the interest bearing debt at the end of period t. It excludes nonmarketable
securities (e.g. savings bonds, special issues to state and local governments), securities held by
other government entities (e.g. the Federal Reserve or the Social Security Trust Fund), or agency
debt (e.g. Tennessee Valley Authority). While the Treasury typically reports the par value of the
debt, Seater (1981), Cox and Hirschhorn (1983), Eisner and Peiper (1984), Cox (1985), and Bohn
(1992) have calculated series on the market value of the Treasury’s portfolio. Our debt series most
closely aligns with Seater’s (1981) MVPRIV2 series (see his Table 1) and Cox and Hirschhorn’s
(1983) series “Market value of privately held treasury debt” (see their Table 6).
Eisner and Pieper (1984), Eisner (1986), and Bohn (1992) computed similar measures of the
government’s interest payments. Rather than computing the terms on the left side of (5) directly,
they exploited the inter-temporal budget constraint (1) to compute interest payments r̃t−1,t Bt−1
as the change in the market value of debt minus the primary deficit. An advantage of that
approach is that there no need to construct the pricing kernels and stripped series; the market
value of the debt can be computed directed from the observed prices and quantities outstanding.
An advantage of our approach is that since we compute the returns on the debt directly our
measure is not sensitive to how the primary deficit is measured. Furthermore, our arithmetic
also allows us (a) to account for the different holding period yields on obligations of different
maturities and thereby form the decompositions of interest payments in table 1 and figures 1 and
6, (b) to execute the counterfactual debt management experiments described in appendix C, and
(c) to dissect the difference between our estimates of the interest costs and those reported by the
Treasury. We turn to this last task in appendix B.

B

Bad accounting: what the government instead reports as interest payments

As documented earlier by Hall and Sargent (1997), our estimates of the interest paid on U.S.
government debt differ substantially from those reported by the government. In this section,
we attempt to track down the sources of differences between our way of accounting for interest
and the government’s. Since they give different answers, these two interest payment series must
be asking different questions. Our series answers the question “what interest payments appear
in the law of motion over time of real government indebtedness?”14 What question does the
14

The law of motion of real government indebtedness is also known as the government budget constraint.

18

government’s interest payment series answer? And how can we compute it in terms of the objects
q, q̄, s, s̄ defined in appendix A?
We won’t get much of an answer by reading government reports. Issues of the Treasury
Bulletin from 1957 to 1982 contained the following concise description of the government’s method
for computing its interest expenses:
The computed annual interest charge represents the amount of interest that would be
paid if the interest-bearing issue outstanding at the end of each month or year should
remain outstanding for a year at the applicable annual rate of interest. The charge
is computed for each issue by applying the appropriate annual interest rate to the
amount of the security outstanding on that date.
We interpret these statements to mean that the government computes interest expenses by adding
next year’s coupon payments to the product of the outstanding principal due next year and the
one-period holding period yield on one-period pure discount bonds. In this appendix, we shall
verify this interpretation by executing this computation with the q, q̄, s, s̄ series from appendix A
and show that it produces a time series that closely approximates the government’s reported series
on interest payments. Then we’ll try to reverse engineer a question that this series is designed
to answer. Finally, we’ll describe in detail how the government’s concept of interest costs fails
to match the concept required by the government’s budget constraint (1) or (2) because it treats
coupon payments and capital gains improperly.
To cast the government’s computations in terms of our notation, it is useful to define the
t−1
t−1
t−1
decomposition st−1
= st−1
t
t (tb) + st (p) + st (c) where st (tb) represents the par value of onet−1

coming
t (p) denotes the contribution to st
t−1
from principal due on longer term bonds that mature at t, and st (c) represents coupon payments
on longer term bonds accruing at time t.
Then we believe that the government reports the following object as its nominal interest
payments at time t:

Figure 10: Our Reverse Engineered Estimates of the Government’s Reported Interest Payments
The dashed-red line in the officially reported interest costs divided by the market value of debt. The solid blue line
is equation (14) divided by the market value of debt.

In Figure 11 we contrast the Federal Government official interest payment series with our
interest payment series using annual end of the year data from 1941 to 2008. 15 In this graph,
we report both our measure of interest paid (the solid blue line) and the government’s reported
interest payments (dashed green line) as percentages of the market value of debt. As can be seen
in this figure, our series is lower on average and considerably more volatile than the government’s.
As we report in table 3 the official interest payments average 5.79 percent of the debt while our
measure of the real return on the debt averages 1.69. We then subtract the inflation rate from
officially reported interest payments (dashed red line). The two series have roughly the same
mean (2.02 versus 1.69). Up until the 1980s it appears that much of the difference between the
reported series and our series is due to inflation. Post-1980 something else is going on, namely,
nominal interest rate risk that, in a lower and less volatile inflation environment, translated into
real interest rate risk.
15

The Federal Government reports its interest payments in two places: the annual budget issued by the Treasury
and the NIPA. We use fiscal data from the NIPA Table 3.2 rather than budget data from the Treasury for two
reasons. First, the Treasury’s reports data for the fiscal year, which runs from October to September while we
measure the cost of funds on a calendar year basis. Second, NIPA interest payments (NIPA table 3.2, line 28)
exclude interest paid to other government trust funds, such as the Social Security trust fund. Interest on the public
debt reported by the Treasury includes interest paid to these trust funds. NIPA interest payments do include
interest paid to the Military and Civil Service retirement funds, because the NIPA shows the assets for these funds
in the household sector. We net out these payments using data on NIPA table 3.18B, line 24.

What question is being answered?

To what question is the object computed in (15) the answer? Frankly, this has us stumped. Object
(15) mixes apples and oranges – imputed interest and principal repayments – in peculiar ways. The
spirit of the calculation seems to be, “let’s calculate the total funds the government must devote at
time t to servicing its debt,” where the devil resides in the details of what one means by servicing.
An interesting question, might be “given the structure of debt in place at t − 1, how many dollars
of principal plus coupons fall due at t?” But that is not what the government computes either.
The real valuenof the total
has to³ come up to honor´ its promises at t
³ funds that the government
´o n
t−1

t−1
is evidently vt st (c) + st (tb) + st (p) + s̄t (c) + s̄t−1
+ s̄t−1
t (tb) + s̄t (p) = vt st
t .
The government seems to want to exclude repayments of principal and to record only enough
t−1
interest payments to roll over its outstanding principal. Thus, the quantity vt st−1
t (c) + s̄t (c)
measures the quantity of real resources that the government has to come up with to make coupon
payments
³ (but not principal
´ ³repayments) to bond
´ holders. The government also has to come up
t−1
t−1
t−1
t−1
with vt st (tb)+st (p) + s̄t (tb)+ s̄t (p) in repayments of principal at time t. Apparently,
the government multiplies these principal payments by the appropriate one-period holding period
1
1
yields for one-period zero-coupon bonds r̃t,t−1
, r̄t−1,t
, sums the outcomes, and counts that sum as
a contribution to its total interest payments.

A symptom of the conceptual error in the government’s interest payment series is the absence of

(16)

can help isolate the source of the government’s error in computing its interest costs. This expression reveals the following misconceptions in the government’s way of estimating its interest
payments:
1. The first term in braces is total coupon payments. But coupon payments should not be
viewed as pure interest payments: they are part principal repayments, part interest payments.
2. The second term in braces correctly measures what is properly a part of government interest
payments according to our budget-constraint-driven definition (1) or (2), namely, the capital
gains or losses that the government pays on its one-period zero coupon bonds; but . . .
3. Expression (16) evidently contains no accounting for the capital gains or losses that the
government pays on its zero coupon bonds of maturities longer than one-period. Onej

Counterfactual debt management

As a way to bring out quantitatively the possibilities that interest rate risk has presented debt
management authorities, we perform some artificial counterfactual experiments that study what
the time path of B/Y would have been under alternative settings for {stt+j }, on the assumption
t }.16
of unchanged {vt , qt+j
We consider alternative debt-management policies in which the government issues only nominal interest bearing debt. The class of feasible financing rules is

This equation can be solved recursively to build up paths for stt+j and decompositions of interest

We consider four policies:

where ρi,j is the correlation coefficient between the holding period returns of i and j period
zero-coupon bonds, and σi is the standard deviation of the holding period return for an i
period zero-coupon bond.

Aizenman and Marion (2009) run a series of counterfactual experiments holding the maturity structure of the
debt fixed at it historical values and varying the inflation rate. In contrast, we hold the inflation rate at its historical
rates and vary the maturity structure.

each period. We assume the government knows vt+1 and qt+j
prior to choosing stt+j .

For the first two policies, the entire debt is purchased and resold each period make sure
all the debt is held in either one-year bills or ten-year zero-coupon bonds (depending on the
experiment). For the third and fourth policies, we assume the government can see into the
future. Under the third policy, we assume the government knows the variances and covariances
of the holding period returns of the different maturities over the sample period (1942-2008) when
it computes the weights of the minimum variance portfolio. For our sample period, the timeinvariant portfolio shares that minimize the variance of the holding period returns are: f1 = 1.26,
f5 = −0.35, f10 = 0.09. Under the clairvoyance policy, we not only assume that the Treasury
can fully anticipate movements in the term structure one year in advance but can also act on
this foresight by freely shifting the government policy to minimize its interest costs. While it is
unrealistic to expect that the Treasury could ever implement either of these last two polices, they
provide ‘best-case’ or ‘upper bound’ benchmarks, to compare to the alternative policies.
For all four experiments, we start with the market value of debt at the end of 1941. In
figures 12, 14, 16, and 18, we plot the holding period returns for each of these counterfactual
portfolios. In figures 13, 15, 17, and 19, we plot the time path of the debt-to-GDP ratio for each
portfolios. In table 4 we report for each portfolio the mean and standard deviation of the holding
period returns and the terminal debt-to-GDP ratio.
Prior to the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in 1951 the path of returns is close to invariant
to the choice of portfolio. Examination of figures 12, 14, 13, and 15 indicates that debt management policies weighted toward longer maturities would have led to lower interest costs and less
accumulation of debt over the period from the Accord until the early 1980s. After the early 1980s,
debt-management policies weighted toward shorter maturities would have generally lowered interest costs and led to less accumulation of debt. From figure 4 it is clear that the Treasury and
Federal Reserve steadily reduced the average maturity of outstanding debt from the 1940s until
the early 1970s; they then increased the average maturity during the late 1970s and throughout
the 1980s. Our analysis indicates that to have minimized its borrowing costs, the government
should have engaged in the opposite strategy.
Over the entire sample, a portfolio of shorter maturity debt would have generated lower
borrowing costs, a reduction in the variance of the returns, and a lower 2008 debt-to-GDP ratio
than a portfolio of longer maturity debt. Consistent with the plot of the nominal payouts reported
in figure 1, we see in figures 12 and 14 that the high volatility of returns in the post-1980 period
was largely concentrated in the longer-term securities. The weights for the minimum variance
portfolio suggest that the bills-only policy is close the minimum variance portfolio. This suggestion
is verified in figures 12 and 16.17

Given the ability of nominal debt to act as a hedge to fiscal shocks, it may not be optimal for the government

Table 4: Counterfactual Debt Management Policies
Under the clairvoyance policy we see that even if the Treasury could have minimized its interest
costs, returns would have been considerably more volatile than we observed and we would still
have a positive debt-to-GDP ratio. The illustrates the limits of debt management to offset deficit
spending. Even with the 20/20 hindsight, it would not have been possible to shift all the burden
of deficit spending onto bondholders.
