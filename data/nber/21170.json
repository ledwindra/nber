    "abstract": "\n\nAfter highly publicized lawsuits against McDonald\u2019s in 2002, 26 states adopted Commonsense Consumption Acts (CCAs) \u2013 aka \u2018Cheeseburger Bills\u2019 \u2013 that greatly limit fast food companies\u2019 liability for weight-related harms.  We provide the first evidence of the effects of CCAs using plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of CCA adoption across states.  In two-way fixed effects models, we find that CCAs significantly increased stated attempts to lose weight and consumption of fruits and vegetables among heavy individuals.  We also find some evidence that CCAs increased employment in fast food.  Finally, we find that CCAs significantly increased the number of company-owned McDonald\u2019s restaurants and decreased the number of franchise-owned McDonald\u2019s restaurants in a state.  Overall our results provide novel evidence supporting a key prediction of tort reform \u2013 that it should induce individuals to take more care \u2013 and show that industry-specific tort reforms can have meaningful effects on market outcomes.\n\n",
