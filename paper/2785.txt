CREDIBILITY, DEBT AND UNEMPLOYMENT:
IRELAND S FAILED STABILIZATION

ABSTRACT

Can the credibility of a stabilization plan affect the
output costs of diainflation? The new classical economics has asserted
this possibility, but little evidence has been brought forward. This paper
analyzes the stabilization program of Ireland in the l980s against the
background of the new classical economics, The main questions are two: Did
EMS membership yield a special credibility bonus? And is the
stabilization program sustainable. The answer to both questions is
negative.

The idea of a credibility bonus Is an attractiye potential
policy implication of EMS membership: by joining the EMS, playing by the
rules of fixed exchange rates and benefiting from the stabilizing
influence of German inflation targets, a country's policy makers achieve a
dramatic turn around in expectations, in inflation and in long-term
interest rates. But the evidence on international disinflation in the
1980s shows that it was not limited to EMS members; all OECD countries
experienced sharply reduced inflation and a large drop in long-term
nominal interest rates, EMS membership did not contribute to reduce the
sacrifice ratio of disinflation. In fact Germany, on whose anti-inflation
credentials the credibility effects are supposedly based has one of the
highest sacrifice ratios among DECD countries.
Ireland did reduce inflation to the German level, but a
serious public debt problem has emerged and the unemployment rate stands
near 20 percent. This raises questions of the Sargent-Wallace kind about
the sustainability of the program.

IRELAND'S FAILED STABILIZATION1

A much debated issue in the macroeconomics of stabilization is the
existence of a credibility effect and how to reap it. Can confidence in a
stabilization plan can affect the output costs of a disinflation? The new
classical economics has asserted chat this is, indeed, the case: a new program
(under new management) if it were fully credible, would lead economic agents to
set wages and prices in accordance with the announced program. The transition
to low inflation could be achieved without much delay and without significant
unemployment. Long-term nominal ssaet prices would quickly reflect the change

in expectations Indeed, in the perspective of the new classical economics any
different outcome would be the consequence of a misreading of the program or a
lack of belief in the policy makers' determination to actually carry out the
announced measures.

The credibility literature has blossomed in the aftermath of the
work of Barro and Gordon (1983) and Backus and Driffill (1985). The theory is

clear and plausible, but the evidence is primarily anecdotal. mete ace,
hovever, some attempts to lend empirical support to thts strand of thinking.
In particular Sargent (1982, 1963, 1986) has given a strong reading of this

paradigm in his deacription of the ends of four hyperinflations. He has also
interpreted the 1926 Poincare stabilization in France as a clear example of the

model's predictions.2
It is interesting to look at the recent disinflation experience
worldwide, but particularly in several high-inflation countries in Europe to

judge the extent to which success at reducing inflation can he seen as another
instance of these texthonk cases of credible stabilization. The sharp break in
the pattern of high inflation and high nominal interest rates in the early

l983s in Ireland, Italy, the UK or Denmark can certainly be interpreced as a
response to [he shift in policies and a sign of confidence and imprcved
expectations.

The emphasis on the central role of expectations is en attractive
interpretation of the policy implications of EMS membership: by joining the
EMS, playing by the rules of fixed exchange rates and benefiting from the
stabilizing influence of German inflation targets1 a country's policy makers
achieve a dramatic turn around in expectations, in inflation and in long-term
interest rates. But there is nor only the question whether EMS membership did
in fact play a critical role. There is elso a wider failure of the paradigm in
a caae like Ireland's: while inflation and lone-term nominal intereat rates did
decline, real intareat rates turned sharply higher (fiscal correction

notwithstanding) and unemployment increased massively, as did public debt. ke
therefore conclude that Ireland's experience bears more resemblance to the

unsustainable path of Sargent-Wallace 'tmonetariat arithmetic" than to Poincare-

style costless stabilization. This paper concentrates on the experience of
Ireland; it attempts to identify special EMS effects in the stabilization hut
also places it in the wider context of what happened to inflation and interest
rates in the group of industrial countriea.
Our analysis starta out with a sketch of the new classical paradigm,
using the Poincare stabilization as a concrete example of the difficulty
encountered in interpreting a ccncrete case. From there we proceed to an
analysis of the decline in inflation and interest rates in the 1980a. The
following two sections deal with the specific experience of Ireland. The
concluding section draws some policy conclusions.

policies. The equilibrium hypothesis is that economic agents set prices, wages
and interest rates on the basis of all available information in a manner thac
achieves their plans. There is no anticipated, involuntary unemployment in this
world. In the new classical model a fully understood and believed shift in
monetary policy to e noninflationsry stance should rot lead to any protracted
unemployment: economic agents will recognize the shift in policy and will aet a
che future path of all nominal variables --wages, prices, interest races-- to
be consistent with this new monetary regime under conditions of full
employment.

Sargent (l986,p.lll) baa characterized the implications of the new
classical economics in contrasting this school of thought with the Phillipscurve tradition:

"ge now turn to the second group of theories of inflation, which are the

But Sargent (lSS,p. 114) also notes that in those circumstances
where there is no clearly identifiable1 credible change in regime a policy
shift can prove costly. Commenting sceptically en the Thatcher experiment, he
notes:

The alternative to the equilibrium model would be a Taylor-Fischer
model of

long-term wage contracts. These wage contracts would be

reflect rationally the public's expectations about monetary and fiscal policy
Unlike in the equilibrium model, however, the concern for relative wages of
different groups (or for real wages) leaves open the poaaibility of at least
temporary unemployment as the economy adjusts to a shock or to a change in the
monetary regime.3 Credibility effects must be added as an extra source of
unemployment. This latter possibility, of course, also exists in the
equilibrium approach. In fsct, Sargent (l986,p.llS) comments (in contrasting
the Thatcher stabilization with that of Poincare) on the difficulty in
assessing gradualist versus shock treatments.

"Gradualism itwitea speculation about future reversals, or U.turna. in
policy. Large contemporary government deficits unaccompanied by concrete
prospecta for future surpluses promote realistic doubts about whether
monetary restraint must be abandoned sooner or later to help finance the
deficit. Such doubts not only call into question the likelihood that the
plan can succeed in reducing inflation permanently but also can induce
high real costs in terms of depressed industry and lengthened unemployment
in response to what may be viewed as only temporary downward movements in
nominal demand due to the monetary restraint."

Subsequent literature in the new classical mode has focuaed on
expectations forration in a context of imperfect information games as the
central source cf a program's real effects. Following the work of Earro and

Gordon (1963) the literature views the inflation issue as a game between the
public ar.d a policy maker whoae anti-inflation attitudea are not known to the

public with certainty. Policy makers may or may not be strongly anti-inflation
crienred; consecuently hey may or not seek to fool the public into a low-

about policy makera on the basis of actual inflation experience, inflationist
policy makers have en interest in building anti-inflation credentials which
they then would hope to exploit later in a more dramatic inflation surprise.
That possibility exists because the public never knows with certainty the

policy mskers true preferences.

Persson (1988) in his survey shows thst credibility is central to the
effects cf regime changes in the new classical model. Work by Backus and

1.2 4ging Credibility
How would one in fact, at the time of a stabilization program, judge

the degree to which a program inspirea credibility? Sargents own
qualifications make entirely clear that a fully credible stabilization must be
a rare event. The problem is that at the outset of a program there is no
assurance of how effective the measures in fact will be and whether they can be
sustained. Programs fflay look poor from the outset and in fact fsil; but they

may also look poor but then succeed as a result of unexpectedly favorable
developments. Alternatively, a program, may look as if it were certain to
succeed and then is brought down by unexpectedly unfavorable developments.
Finally there is the rare program that looks good and in facc turns out to be
successful. In those cases where stabilization in fact succeeded there is
rarely any evidence that this success was apparent from the outset.
In Dornbusch (1987) I review the course of stabilization in Germany

to aae the point that confidence and credibility trailed by months behind the
fact of stabilization. It. Dcrnbusch and Fischer (1986) we show the difficulty

judring st the outset failing and successful programs. a note in particular
that out of 3 stabilization efforts, two fail. The same point has bean made by
it

ebb (1965)
Focusing

on the credibility of a program in the parspeetive of the

new classical economics, any ds;repan:y from full employment would be a

reflection of less than full credibility. An slcerna:ive is to obsee changes
in long-tarn nominal interest rates. A decline in long-term interest rates

can be interpreted would be evidence that a stabilization program is supported
by credibility. Disappearance of yield differentials, both on short and on
long-term securities, show a disappearance of expectations of rising inflation
and increasing currency depreoiation Changes in long-term interest rates are
then measures of how public confidence in stabilization is progressing.
Applying the term structure theory, the yield on long-term bonds reflerte
current and anticipated future short-term interest nominal rates A For a given
real interest rate, thanges in the yield on long-term bonds represent changes
in the path of expected inflation,
Credible stabilization leads to an expectation of disinflation and hence to
reduced long-term interest rates. Conversely, a policy nix that is ultimately
expettad to become inflationary is reflerted in high conical long-term interest
rates. Andersen and Riaager (19S7, 1988) have illustrated this reputation-based
disinflation model by studying the path of interest rates in Denmark during the
l982 stabilization,

We turn next to the 1926 Pointare stabilization which illustrates
nar.y of the issues raised in this section.

1.3 An illustration: The Poirrare Stabilization

There are not many examples of "fully rredible stabilization", bt
the 1926 Pointare stabilization in France has become the exanole par exrellenre
as a result of Sargent'a vigorous portreval of the episode.

4See Begg (1983) for the relation between the yield on long- term bonds and the
sequence of future short rates.

1.3.1 The Events France had emerged from World War I with a substantial public
debt. Would the country go the way of Germany, with hyperinfletion, or the way

of the UK with an attempt to restore the prewar parity of gold? Keynes (1926)
discussed the issues of exchange rates, debts and budgets in his Opan Letter
to the French Minister of Finance".5 He saw France's large public debt as an

obstacle tn stabilization and argued that
"the level cf the Franc exchange will continue to fall until the
commodity value of the frsnc due to the rentiet has fallen to a
proportion nf the nstionsl income which accords with the habits and
mentality of the country."
In fact, depreciation and inflation were chosen in the early 1920t
ss the means of reducing the real value of debt. The inflation was created
basically by maintaining low interest rates on the floating debt, thus assuring
exchange deprecistion and ultimately an exchange rate collapse as shown in

Figure 1. In 1921-2& the debt-GDP ratio averaged 16? percent: by 1926 it had
already declined to only 114 percent. Against this favorable background
Poincare undertook the decisive 1926 stabilization.
Successful stabilizations can only be judged ex post: many

stabilizations in their early stages (like bebies) show great promise and only
later can one determina which were the decisive events that made this one

succeed and that one fail. The Poincare stabilization was different ss udged
by the urgency of the situation, the decisiveness of the measures and the
special role of Pointsre as a known and eatablished fiscal conservative, here
is how Wolfe (195l,p.34) describes the events:

government expenditures.

An external loan was arranged and the proceeds were used to reverae currency
depreciation. The Franc appreciated within a month by 28%. Wholesale prices had
been rising at 8-10% per month, now they fell for two months. Stability had been
achieved!

These measures and eventa convey precisely what we would understand
to be the essential measures for successful stabilization. But (with apologies to
credibilists) the description just offered is that of the £a.U..ad 1924

stabilization, not of the successful 1926 stabilization.

Having made our point, consider next the July 1926 stabilirstion. At
the center of the stabilization is (once again) Poincare. Sargent writes:

"Raymond Poincare was s fiscal conservative, who had raised taxes while
Prime Minister in 1924, and was known to advocate balanced budgets and
France's return to gold.. as soon as he assumed control of the government.
and even before his program was enacted by the legislature, the Franc
recovered and inflstion stopped, -- The stabIlization of the French Franc
vas followed by several years of high prcsperit. The French stabilization
thus seema to fit the prediction of the rational expectations equilibrium
aDproach."

The immediate turnaround in the French Franc (Fisure 1) does, indeed,
convey

the impreasion of an overnight change in the public's perception of

polity. Interestingly, the budget had already been balanced before the crisis
got undervay. Makinen and ;'oodward (1957) reccgr.Ice this point and show that

the

crisis was related to the floating debt and interest rate ceilings, not to

the budget, Political instsbility, in particular the notion of a capital le

11

promoted by the Left? had added to the motives for capital flight. With
Poincare holding office there was an immediate recognition that special
taxation of capital would not be a risk anymore, at least for the time being.
Taxation did increase, but the immediate reason for the strong appreciation is

no doubt a sharp increase in short-term interest rates ahown in Figure 2. An
increase interest rates always is a means to attract capital inflows, bring
about exchange appreciation and thus impose at least temporary inflation
stabilization.

Was the Poincsre stabilization perceived by the public as a
relatively permanent improvement for public finance, inflation and
depreciation? The movement of long-term bonds--the yield on the 3% rentes shown
in Figure 2-- suggests otherwise. There was, in fact, no sharp and immediate
drop in the long-term interest rate. Between May and November 1926 the yield on

3 rentes only fell from 6.29 to 6.02 percent. Moreover, throughout 1926-2?
(excepting mid-1926) the yield on long-term bonds exceeded the short rate,
thus suggesting a belief that stabilization remained tentative.6 Of course, cbs
realized reel short-tern interest rate was exceptionally high: In the 12 months
from July 1926 wholesale prices fell by 25.8 percent and consumer prices by 3
percent and that is how stabilization was achieved fcr the time beine.
The very gradual decline of the yield on long-term bonds, corpared
with the rapid recorsr-v o the Franc, suggests that exchange rats policy was

mediately credible. 3ut that credibility takes a very spetial form: credible

61n fact, even 2 years after successful stabilization the yield on long-term bonds
remained higher than after the breakdown of the unsuccessful 1924 stabilization.

until further notice. In that case one would expect, with a positive short-term
interest differential, an inflow of capital which supports the exchange rate
policy. Following the informal exchange stabilization, tong-term bond yields
did not fall much, suggesting that stabilization remained tentative until it
was validated by the sheer experience of the new policies and their viability.
Models of speculative attack on a fixed exchange rece regime show in
fact exactly this possibility. Even policies that mre ultimstel1 unsustainable,
they can survive for a while provided they are supported by reserves and/or
high interest rates.7 This is the key to understanding why some of the programs
that ultimately fail can be 'tapt up for a while.

1.3.2 Evsluaticn: The Poincare stabilization, judged in the context of the
credibility literature helps make two points. First, there is no realistic way
of telling whether s particular stabilization program will in fact succeed with

certainty or fail without question, The Poincare program did succeed, there
remains the question whether it succeeded because of the fiscal reform of the
previous years, the erosion of the real value of the public debt that had
already taken place before or because of the decisive support to the exchange
race.

The second point is thac successful stabilization is rarely if eve:

established from one day

to

the next. The political circtatances in which

instability emerges do net change overnight. Stiff measures might be taken, 'cut

7See Salant and Henderson (1978), Krugman (1979), Flood and Carber (1984) and

(1987),

13

there is no assurance that they will not be revoked the next day (as was the
case in France in 1924). There is no effective precommitment and hence
stabilization is something that can only be established with the passage of
time. Once the public adapts to the new reality, and views stability as the
rule, this stability is extrapolated and is reflected in reduced long-term
interest rates. In the short run credibility thrives mostly from tight money
and a fixed exchange rate. The behavior of long-term interest rates in Franca,
following the 1926 stabilization, certainly does not suggest an immediate
confidence in a sharp break of the inflation process.

1.4 Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic
A final strand of lIterature highlights the izplioationa of
unsustaInable (and hence incredible) policy regimes. Sargent and 1.'allaoe (1981)

have explored the implications of an unsustainable shift to tIght money. They
consider a world where budget deficits are financed by money and debt. A shift
toward reduced money creation implies accumulation of debt and a rising
interest burden.

If debt grow:h becomes excessive the shift to tight

cannot be

sustained: ultimately. to avoid insolvency inflationary money creation becomes

necessay as a means to finance the accumulated interest bill. Sargent and
allace conclude(Sargent (198G,p.l39):
"without help from the fisral authorities, fighting current inflation with
monetary polity must eventually lead to higher future infation."

rich:

This problem is of interest because in several European countries,

moat notably in Ireland, inflation stabilization by tight money has, in fact,

14

translated into an extraordinary fiscal problem: the debt ratio has risen far
above 100 percent and keeps rising. There is a genuine question of how the
mushrooming of debt can be stopped and whether future inflation will be che
answer. Historically there is ample precedent for debt reduction through
inflation and capital levies as Alesina (l988a) and Eichengreen (1988) have
shown. The question is which way Ireland might go. If high future inflation,
with the benefits of seigniorage and inflationary debt liquidation is the
answer, the question arises why nominal long-term interest rates have declined
so much.

We

turn next

to the Irish stabilization to see how much credibility

factcrs can be discerned in that experience.

2. DISINFlATION IN IRElAND
After having pegged its exchange rate to the pound sterling since
1922 Ireland abandoned the sterling peg in 1978 and joined the EMS. And as the
ENS

became increasingly a zone of monetary stability, Ireland played the game

with gteat success. By 1988 inflation had declined practically to the Cenan

level! The

Irish

membership

was an effective disinflation device for couricries who had lacked a

experience would thus seem to bear out the argument that ENS

firm anchor and hence were experiencing drifting, high inflation races.
This argument has been advanced in a number of recent papers
including Akerhoim (1988), Collins (1988), Ciavazzi and Pagano (1987),
Ciovannini

and Cievazci (1987, 1989), as well

as Andersen and Risager (1987).

Akerholm sumnarizes this hypothesis as follows.

15

"By joining an international fixed exchange rate area like the ENS, tha
country could demonstrate a atronger commitment to a fixed exchange rate;
a depreciation is no more a unilateral affair but requires the approval of
all the participanta in the currency area. Furthermore, short-term
borrowing facilities and co-operative errangements would be made available
in order to safeguard the financiel base for intervention at times of
market unrest. Hence, the risks of a depreciation are reduced, which
should help reduce risk premis and impose more flexibility on the behavior
of the labor market."

As we shall see asset markets did, in fact, show a response in the
sense of credibility although that effect did not go all the way to the
elimination of yield differentials, Because yield differentials did remain
high,

while

inflation differentials vanished, real interest rstms increasingly

became a problem. But an even more important issue was the lack of a flexible
labor market. A major fiscal contraction hsd no counterpart in a crowding-it of
net exports via increased international competitiveness. The elimination of
inflation therefore gave rise cc a fiscal problem and unemployment of
unprecedented proportion.

2.1 :nfletion and interest Rates

The yield on 15-veer bonds in Ireland peaked in Febnoarv 1962 and by
October had declined by 5 percentage points. The rapid decline of long-term
interest

rates was merched, as

The magnitude of the decline in yields is far more rapid and aizeable
than what occurred during the Poincare stabilization. The immediate question is
to know what happened in politics and/or economic policy to bring about so
massive a change in interest rates? Table 2 ahows the main events in politics,

It is tempting to aaaign to EMS membership and specifically the
policy of not seeking large realignments a central role in the shift of
inflationary expectations. We investigate that hypothesis in more detail below.

2.2 The 1982 Adjustment
The height of instability prevailed at the beginning of 1982 when
the government fell on the issue of a tight budget. Early 1982 provides a
watershed not in the sense that the need and willingness to implement
stabilization first became apparent. Certainly the need for auscerity had been

clear at least since 1981. Figure 4 shows the long-term interest differential
with Germany. This differential increases sharply toward the end of 1981 and
the beginning of 1982 and then falls off rapidly. The decisive fact of early

l982was that a political ccnsensua emerged to actually push these measures
forward. Moreover, this consensus survived changes in government and thus
rained tomentum. The consensus supported four specific policy measures:
• A shift toward consistently positive and high real interest rates.

negative rates, starting in 1982 real rates are always positive and

• A fixed exchange rate policy in the context of the EMS

provided a

strong anchor. It s especially significant that in both 1982 EMS realignment
Ireland maintained the central rate.

. A fiscal policy of consistently reducing the primary deficit,

a reduction to 6.2 percent, followed in 1983 and 1984 by a further reduction to
only 1.9 percent. Fiscal action thus was

drematic.8

Partly as a result of ricing unemployment, partly as a

result of

wage agreements the increase in labor compensation slowed down from 18,1% in
1981 to only 14.4% in 1982.

An essential element in translating these factors into a reduction
long-term inflation expectations was the emerging political

of

consensus on the

need for fiscal correction following the inflation of 25% per year in late
1981. The fact that the new Fianne Fail government in Maroh submitted broadly
the same budget as the one on which the previous government had fallen
substantiates this consensus.

The various pieces of the stabilization effort had strongly
reinforcing features. Specifically tight monetary policy

assured that credit

demand would be financed abroad since the cost of borrowing abroad (including
reduced exchange depreciation) now seemed lower than domestic

loan rates. That

in turn meant capital inflows and hence support for the exchange rate.
exchange race strongly supported by capital inflows, nominal

cith the

interest rates

could come down to a narrower differential.
The decline in nominal long- term interest rates can thus be

interpreted as e response to the policy package and to the fact of a major
reduction in inflation. A special role must go to the exchange rate policy.

8The data are set out in the appendix.

Not

20

taking advantage of an EMS realignment for devaluation in 1982 signified a
shift from an accommodating exchange rate policy to a determined effort to
squeeze inflation. At this stage the EMS was clearly becoming an instrument of
disinflation. The resulting change in exchange rate expectations allowed a
decline in short and long-term interest rates.

It is also interesting to note that in 1982 the term structure was
basically flat. In terms of models of policy makers' reputation there is no
suggestion (perhaps surprisingly) that confidence was stronger in the near term
than in the long term. Interpreting the term structure in terms of risks of
depreciation the premium above Cermsn rstes was flat across maturities. We
return to this point below.

2.3 Post-1982 Consolidation
Following the initial adjustment in interest rates, the period from
1982 to 1988 shows steady further decline in rates. Over this period inflation
was brought down to less than 2 percent1 the primary budget moved all the way
to surplus and unemployment increased to above 18 percent. Much of the budget
progress was concentrated in 1963-84 when the Drirnaty deficit was brought down

to less than 2% of COP. Infistion declined rapidly and already by 1984 had
already fallen to the level of the averaae of the 12 European countries and
then kept up with the pack.
One especially interesting episode in this period of cor.solidation is

late 1986 and early 1987. In this period the pound sterling (not in the ENS)

weakened against the EMS currencies. Sterling is of special interest to Ireland

21

because mote than 40 percent of imports come from the UK and the UK market
accounts for more than 30 percent of Ireland's exports. Starting in mid-1985
sterling started depreciating, reaching a cumulative peak of 38 percent
(against the DM) in the first quarter of 1987. Thia depreciation caused a
growing loss of competitiveness in Ireland and hence raised increasingly
questions about the country's ability to hold on to the EMS central rate.
In the first 1986 realignment the Irish rate was not moved, but in
the August 1986 realignment Ireland devalued by 8 percent. But this realignment
was insufficient to allay the fears that further devaluation might ensue. These
fears were reinforced by slippage on the budget correction. The long-term
differential with Germany increased from 3

to

8 percent in this episode,

highlighting the fear of depreciation. (See Figure 4) The government fought the
deteriorating expectations, and the resulting capital outflows, with a sharp
tightening of monetary conditions. The short-term interest rate increased frcm
10 percent to 14.6 percent. Pressure on the Irish pound stopped only when
sterling stopped declining in early 1987.
By 1988 strengthening of fiscal contractioo, continuing high real
interest rates and the resulting high unemployment brought down inflation to

German levels and short and long-tan nominal interest rstea had declined to
lass than 10 percent. There continued to be a differential relative to OH
rates, but little queation that the Irish pound, for the time being, was a
harder currency.

-

Before asking questions about the sustainability of the program we
turn to an international comparison. In the 1980s long-ten interact rates

22

declined worldwide. It is therefore interesting to ask how the Irish experience
compares with that of other countries, Specifically, how isuch of the decline in

inflation and interest rates Ireland was due to worldwide factors and how much
can be attributed to the stabilization?

3. INTERffiATIQfl COMPARISONS

In this section we review the international disinflation
and the pattern of declining long-term interest rates worldwide,

experience

The evidence

is relevant in judging whether EMS membership played an obvious and major role
in the Irish disinflation. To answer that question we consider evidence on
three points;

• There was a worldwide disinflation and reduction in long-term
interest rates in the 1980s and thus Ireland's case wss by no means special.
•

We consider

evidence on whether EMS membership exerts a credibility'

bcnus and thus reduces the costs of disinflation.
• It is also interesting to ask whether the Irish reduction in
interest rates is unusual in view of the large accunulation of debt. To address
that question we look at the role of inflation and fiscal factors as
determinants of long'term interest rates in a cross section of countries,

3.1 Interest Rates and Oisinflsn
Ireland was not the only country to experience disinflation in the
lSEOs. On the contrary, evefl' single OECO country went through the same shift

in policies and enjoyed a reduction in inflation and an accompanying reduction
in long-term interest ra:as.

public. The wage-setting public does not know at the outset whether the
government is or is not the inflationist type in the way modelled by Barro and
Cordon (1983). Upon adoption of exchange rate targets there is an immediate
decline in short-term interest rates. But uncertainty about the governments
true nature persists and is reflected in a positively sloped term structure
which reflects the possibility of an ultimate devaluation.
In this analysis actual experience of reduced inflation and anti-

inflation policy decisions and the fact of a fixed exchange rate lead to a
gradual reinforcement of the belief that ftjg policy maker is not inflationist.

As a result over time the level of long-term interest rates further declines,
The term structure premium vanishes as the public conaolidatea their belief
that government does not harbor the intention of an ultimate inflation burst.
This model is used by Andersen and Risager to identify the key policy
decisions that load to a change in expectations and thus to a decline in
term Danfsh interest rates and in the term structure premium. These

3.2 The Cost of Disinflation
Consider next the question whether EMS membership confers specisl
disinflation advantages. That question has been addressed in an extensive
literature on the EMS and especially by Ungerer et al (1986), Rogoff (1985),
Collins (1988) and Cuitian cc al (1988). Both Rogoff and Collins emphasize that
inflation convergence did not occur in the first few years of the ENS; indeed,
a tendency toward converges only atarta

after

1982. Moreover, as alresdy noted

above most industrialized countries had reduced by 1988 inflation rates to
blow 5 percent, independent of EMS membership. Ungerer et al (1986) did find a
significant EMS effect in estimated inflation equations, but their findings are
rightly questioned by Collins.

Rather than considering the question of inflation convergence and the
possibility of an EMS-induced break in the inflation performance there is an
alternative approach that focuses on sacrifice ratios. The sacrifice ratio- -

defined

as the number of extra percent unemployment years per percent reduction

in inflation-S measures the cost of disinflation. If EMS membership conveys
special disinflation advantages we would expect, other things equal, a lower

sacrifice ratio for EMS members. Table 5 shows the sacrifice ratios for all
OECD members (except Turkey and Iceland) for the disir.flatior. experience of

1981-1988.

Note: The sacrifice ratio is calculated aa the ratio of the cumulative
unemployment above the 1981 level divided by the disinflation between 1981 and
1988, using consumer price inflation. All data from OECD Economic Outlook.

It is immediately obvious that EMS membership does not make for small
sacrifice ratios and a regression (not reported here) bears out that fact. It
is striking that Germany, whose anti-inflation reputation is supposed to give
the EMS the credibility bonus has one of the highest sacrifice ratios. This
evidence should firmly lay to rest the view that EMS membership can make
disinflation easiet; it may make it more credible, but even so ft certainly
does not make it cheaper in terws of lost output.

3.3 Convergence
RAther than focussing qn disinflation we can also lock at the

prospects of inflation differentials. If we are willing to assume that longterm real interest rates are equslized across countries then nominal interest
differentials

on 1ong cen securities represent trend differentials in

28

inflation, Alternatively, without any assumption about real interest rates,
long-term interest differentials represent trend bilateral exchange rate
changes. Table 6 shows the average and standard deviation of bilateral longterm interest differentials of various countries with Germany.

It is

apparent that differentials between EMS members and Germany are

neither smaller nor more stable than those between noruuembers and Germany. In

fact, current inflation differentials have narrowed more than long-ten
interest differentials. This suggests that trend depreciation of exchange
razes is expected to remain a characteriatic of the EMS, except between Germany
and the Netherlands.

3.5 Determinants of Lane-ten Interest Razes:
The literature on long-term interest rates has been relatively
unsuccessful in explaining the large changes in the 1980a in individual
countries. 1e use

international

cross section evidence to identify the key

2g

determinants of long-term interest rates. In particular we are interested to

separate out the role of inflation of fiscal variables and once again any
special EMS affecta.

In country studiee there aay be some scope to use aurvey data and
budget forecasta as explanatory variables for (forward-looking) long-term
interest rates, but there is little hope to do so for a large group of
countries. In fact, even consistency of the fiscal dsta may already ha an
issue. We therefore concentrate on current actual variables. Our cross section
covers the main industrialized countries with annual data for the time period
1974 to 1997.

The basic question is what role inflation and fiscal variables play
in determining sn individual country's long-term interest rate. We also want to
know whether the EMS plays s special role in the determination of long-term
interest rates of partner countries. The basic hypothesis is that a country's
long-term interest rate, given external interest rates, is higher the higher is
the rate of inflation. If fiscal variables are to play a role we would expect a
non- interest surplus to be an indication of stabilization and reduced future

inflation. As such it should imply a lower long-term interest rate. finally, if

fears of Sargent-Wallace inflstionsr debt liquidation are a concern we expect
a higher debt/CNP ratio to imply a higher expected rate of inflation and hence
a hfgher interest rate.
In Table 7 we use a pooled annual data of industrialized countries
for the period 1974-87 to uncover the determinants of the large shIft in long- -

term interest rates among industrialized countries.

INFDIFF— differential of inflation with Germany.

Equations 1. and 5. explain long-term interest rates by debt ratios,
the non-interest budget and the inflation rate. Each of the explanatory

31

variables has the expected sign and is significant. Note that the coefficient
cf inflation is significantly different from unity. This is not surprising
because current inflation is certainly not a good indication (on a one-for-one
basis) of future inflation, in addition, of course, there is no presumption of
s constant real interest rate, A further interesting point is the role of the
debt ratio. Net public debt (as a fraction of GD') has a significant positi\Te

effect on long-terN interest rates. But the effect is quantitatively small in

that an extra 60 percent of GD? in debt raises the long-term rate by only a
percentage point.

A difficulty with equations 1. and 5. is that they concentrate
extlusively on national determinants and do not allow for a common world
capital market or constraints from a monetary regime like the EMS. We therefore
now turn to these factora. In our discussion we concentrate on the regressions
for European countries.

Equation 6. introduces the German long-term interest rats (for the
other European countries) as an additional explanatory variable. This procedure

assumes that Germany sets exogenously its policies and long-ten rate,

but that

the rest of Europe is influenced by the German rate. We obsee that the German
rate is, indeed significant. Higher German rates raise interest rates in

other

European countries. At the sac time the debt variable becomes insignificant.
Further regressions show the influence of the inflation differential
between a coun;r s.nd Germany (flTFDIFF). This variable, too, is highly

as determinants of long-term interest rates. This is a striking finding because
it runs so much counter to the belief that extremely high debt ratios Cas that

that notion, the equations support the view that current flows variables such

We have already seen in Table S steve that Ireland had one of the highest

increased so

much.

4. FAILED STABILIZATION
Ireland has stopped inflation and the primary budget today is in
surplus. In the near-term a major outbreak of inflation and depreciation is
entirely implausible. Inflation stabilization thus is a fact. But so are two
other points: Firs:, as Figure 10 and Table B show, stabilization has come

stabilization is not complete and can even be said to have failed. Second,

"Only limited progress has been made so far in halting the
accumulation of large Exchequer Deficits; the resulting high levels of
taxation, crowding-out pressures and crushing debt interest bill (nearly
half in respect to foreign debt) have created a difficult environment for
investment and growth. Employment has only recently begun to stabilize
after a prolonged fall, Unemployment has climbed to the unacceptably high
average of 18.75 well above the Community average, but the figure would be
much larger had not emigration moved to high new levels recently, thereby
offsetting the strong underlying growth in the labor supply.

The triumph of low inflation has thus come at the cost (perhaps inevitable) of
extraordinary high unemployment, massive emigration and a precarious debt
overhang. 10

Two questions can be asked at this stage. One is to know why

stabilization led to high unemployment and escalating debt ratios. The other is to
know whether the Irish debt situation ia unsustainable in some well-defined sense.

If so what are the policy options?

4.1 What Went Wrong?
Several factors come together in explaining the extraordinarily poor
performance of the Irish economy. The firs: is that fiscal contraction per se
reduces real aggregate demand and thus reduces output and employment. The textbook
says that expenditure reducing policies must be accompanied by expenditure switching
policies if full employment is to be maintained, These have, not, in fact been used.
On the contrary, the real exchange rate has been allowed to appreciate rather than
depreciate and the real interest rate has increased sharply. Thus increased net
exports due to stronger competitiveness or higher investment were not brought forth
to make up the slack,

part the higher real interest rate is a counterpart of the hard currency play which
continues to command less than full credibility.

at ion The exceptionally high real interest rate has had an immediate effect

on budget dynamics in a way suggested hy Sargent and Wellace (1981) with a
positive and high real interest rate (relative to the growth rate of income) the
ratio of debt to CDI' rises. The recessionary monetary-fiscal and exchange rare

mix has pushed down the growth rate of income and pushed up the real interest
rate. As a result the debt ratio is rising very sharply.

A further factor that deserves attention is seigniorage. In a strongly
growing snd moderately inflating economy the government tan finance part of the
budget deficit by money creaticn. The shift to a low inflation policy sacrifices
these seigniorage revenues. To the extent that slow growth is a byproduct. this
further reduces the scope for money creation. In Ireland, as Table 10 above
shows, the reduction in seignicrage is more than a percent of CDt and thus
represents a significant component of the deficit financing problem.

The mid-1988 forecast for Ireland's budget shows a surplus for the
primary balance. Other things equal the budget improvement (if sustained)
stabilizes or even reduces the debt-income ratio in the years ahead. But real
interest rates continue to be very high. In

In jud;ing whether the debt dynamics is stable at the current levels of

the parameters one has to consider the effective real interest tate ;aid on the
debt. This is the weithted average of realized after-tax real interest rates on
the domestic and (by differing denomination) foreien debt. tne comolete
Ingredients for that calculation are not available, but Table A-I in the Appentix
sets out some of the elements, It appears that a fair amount of the debt was

issued as long-tern bonds in the period of high interest rates. Giava:zi end
Pagano (1988) estimate that the average maturity of the Irish domestic debt Is

41

8 years. Thus at least for the present realized real interest rates are very

There is also a question whether foreign debt is tax exempt and for that
reason has a significantly higher cost. In sum, there does not seem to be a
sensible way to Judge whether the parameters imply a stable debt ratio, one that
further rises or that declines very moderately. But it is entirely clear that a
period of high real interest rates in the world economy would make Irish debt
entirely unsustainable. Since such a scenario has a significant possibility (as
does the low growth outlook) any discussion of sustainability must recognize this
possibility.

.3 Policy Options
Suppose that one concluded that Irish debt is unsustainable, what are
the options that have been suggested? It is easy to identify measures which would
solve the problem:

The average level of taxation in Ireland is not significantly higher
than the average for all OECD countries. The major problem is that the cax
structure ia very inefficient, with large segments of the potential tax base
almost completely excluded from taxation. As a result labor and consumption are
the main targets of taxation, with taxation of corporations, capital including
land or wealth practically non-existent.
Among the feasible options that have been recommended are the following:
• Expenditure cuts are, of course, an option. They are both difficult

and oes:race.
•

The GElD has made a

strong case for broadening the tax base as

the

chief directIon of fiscal reform. Taxation of corporations, as noted, retains
minimal and

exemptions

from the VAT remain plentiful. The introduction of

a

withholding tax (with foreign credit) on the outstanding external debt would also
yteld some revenue.
• A once-and-for- all

intluding land could raise revenue the: could be devoted to

a reduction of

43

the

level of indebtedness. Alternatively, a recurrent wealth tax could finance

part of the deficit.
•

Supply-aide policies are emphasized by many observers as absolutely

central. Unless Ireland becomes far more competitive internationally there is no
chance to grow out of debt. And if Ireland does not very rapidly come out of the
debt trap the real economy will continue to deteriorate. The gain in
competitiveness requires a major reduction in the relative wage in Ireland and
that means devaluation with incomes policy.

Depreciation would not help reduce debt burdens because half

in foreign currency. But for growth a much lower real value of the

punt is essential. If devaluation is accompanied by a forceful incomes policy it
can also help reduce the risk premium.
• Another direction of change, perhaps in combination with a capital

is a restructuring of the debt or even

of the monetary system. At

Ireland pays a confidence tax in that the yield on Irish asseta exceeds that in
Germany by significantly more than the interest differentiel. This implies real

Suppose chat is the risk premium for Irish Tholitical risk. lr. addition the

local currency debt, nearly half of the total debt, tarries a currenry risk
premium of another 2 percentage points (relative to Geriany) . This excess risk

carries a major burden in the budget since it amounts to s ftnancing requirement

44

of fully 1.5 percent of COP per year. This coat can be saved by refunding the
debt into a portfolio of OH, dollar and Yen debt.

Of course1 a decision to move all the way to as debt dencminsted in
foreign currency implies that inflationary liquidation and capital lavies cay
become much harder. It is therefore a step which would only be appropriate in the

process can be largely removed.

An alternative to refunding of the debt would be a return to an

Thus the country should might go the other way adopt the OMark as its currency
and enjoy the reduction in the currency risk premium on its debt. The
intermediate position is doubly expensive because it means foregoing seigniorage
and at the same time incurring the cost of a risk premium.

because the extremely high and inefficient levels of taxation make Ireland a
thoroughly unattractive place for production, in the perspective of a far mote
competitive Europe after 1992 shopping for attractive production locations will
become far more pervasive than it has been in the past and Ireland is bound to
appear Llrtstttactive.

Ireland's problems are worse then these of most countries. There is no
simple clean way out because the debt is so extremely large and the tax burden is
already enough to drive people into emigration. In the lPZOs one would have said
this is the case where a capital levy should restore the normal functioning of
the economy. Unfortunately moderate inflation is not enough and outright levies
are unpopular, even if they may turn out to be the only solution.
The other conclusion we drew deals more broadly with inflation
stabilizarton. A policy cbs: uses a fIxed exchange rate to disinilate and that
requires at the same time fiscal ccnsolidstion can easily run into difficulties.

credibility bonus from EMS membership. Several of the EMS members, including in

particular Germany have the highest sacrifice ratios among the OECD members.
There is some indication of credibility effects in asset markets: long-term
interest rates have followed current inflation to a very significant extent, even
though they have not gene all the way. But Irish market unemployment has
increased sharply and remains stubbornly high: half the inflow into the labor
force emigrates end the other half becomes unemployed! That experience is sharply
at odf.s with the new classical model of the labor market and there is no

plausIble way in which these events tan be interpreted as arising from confusions
about government policy. The lesson for stabilization policy is clearly that
governments must pay far more attention to the need for crowding-in through
increased competitiveness. A major real depreciation at the outset of the program
would provide the required offset to budget cutting.
