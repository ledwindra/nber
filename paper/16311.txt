Measuring the Output Responses to Fiscal Policy

ABSTRACT
A key issue in current research and policy is the size of fiscal multipliers when the economy is in recession.
We provide three insights. First, using regime-switching models, we find large differences in the size
of spending multipliers in recessions and expansions with fiscal policy being considerably more effective
in recessions than in expansions. Second, we estimate multipliers for more disaggregate spending variables
which behave differently relative to aggregate fiscal policy shocks, with military spending having
the largest multiplier. Third, we show that controlling for predictable components of fiscal shocks
tends to increase the size of the multipliers in recessions.

The impact of fiscal policy on output and its components has long been a central part of fiscal
policy analysis. But, as has been made clear by the recent debate over the likely effects and
desired composition of fiscal stimulus in the United States and abroad, there remains an
enormous range of views over the strength of fiscal policy’s macroeconomic effects, the
channels through which these effects are transmitted, and the variations in these effects and
channels with respect to economic conditions. In particular, the central issue is the size of fiscal
multipliers when the economy is in recession.
The gist of the recent literature on this issue has effectively been to echo earlier
Keynesian arguments that government spending is likely to have larger expansionary effects in
recessions than in expansions. Intuitively, when the economy has slack, expansionary
government spending shocks are less likely to crowd out private consumption or investment. To
the extent discretionary fiscal policy is heavily used in recessions to stimulate aggregate demand,
the key empirical question is how the effects of fiscal shocks vary over the business cycle. The
answer to this question is not only interesting to policymakers in designing stabilization
strategies but it can also help the economics profession to reconcile conflicting predictions about
the effects of fiscal shocks across different types of macroeconomic models.
Despite these important theoretical insights and strong demand by the policy process for
estimates of fiscal multipliers, there is little 1 empirical research trying to assess how the size of
fiscal multiplies varies over the business cycle. In part, this dearth of evidence reflects the fact
that much of empirical research in this area is based on linear structural vector autoregressions
(SVARs) or linearized dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models which by

study the effects of fiscal policy on consumption in expansions and recessions.

construction rule out state-dependent multipliers. 2 The limitations of these two approaches
became evident during the recent policy debate in the United States, when government
economists relied on neither of these approaches, but rather on more traditional large-scale
macroeconometric models, to estimate the size and timing of U.S. fiscal policy interventions
being undertaken then (e.g., Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein 2009, Congressional Budget
Office 2009). This reliance on a more traditional approach, in turn, led to criticisms based on
conflicting predictions which used SVAR and DSGE approaches (e.g., Robert J. Barro and
Charles J. Redlick, 2009, John F. Cogan et al., 2009, Eric M. Leeper, Todd B. Walker, and ShuChun Susan Yang, 2010). A main objective of this paper is to explore this gray area and to
provide estimates of state-dependent fiscal multipliers.
Our starting point is the classic paper by Olivier Blanchard and Roberto Perotti (2002),
which estimated multipliers for government purchases and taxes on quarterly US data with the
identifying assumptions that (1) discretionary policy does not respond to output within a quarter;
(2) non-discretionary policy responses to output are consistent with auxiliary estimates of fiscal
output elasticities; (3) innovations in fiscal variables not predicted within the VAR constitute
unexpected fiscal policy innovations; and (4) fiscal multipliers do not vary over the business
cycle. These multipliers are still commonly cited, although subsequent research has questioned
whether the innovations in these SVARs really represent unanticipated changes in fiscal policy,
the challenge relating both to expectations and to whether the changes in fiscal variables, notably
2

Alternative identification approaches, notably the narrative approach of Valerie A. Ramey and Matthew D. Shapiro
(1998) and Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (2010), rely instead on published information about the nature
of fiscal changes. But while the narrative approach offers a potentially more convincing method of identification, it
imposes a severe constraint on its own, that the effects of only a very specific class of shocks can be evaluated
(respectively, military spending build-ups and tax changes unrelated to short-term considerations such as recession
or the need to balance spending changes). Furthermore, the narrative approach tends to provide qualitative
assessments of the effects of fiscal policy shocks while policymakers are most interested in quantitative estimates of
the effects. Romer and Romer (2010) and Ramey (2011) are recent exceptions that provide quantitative estimates of
fiscal multipliers.

taxes, represent actual changes in policy, rather than other changes in the relationship between
fiscal variables and the included SVAR variables.
Building on Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and the subsequent studies, our paper extends
the existing literature in three ways. First, using regime-switching SVAR models, we estimate
effects of fiscal policies that can vary over the business cycle. 3 We find large differences in the
size of spending multipliers in recessions and expansions with fiscal policy being considerably
more effective in recessions than in expansions. Second, to measure the effects for a broader
range of policies, we estimate multipliers for more disaggregate spending variables, which often
behave quite differently in relation to aggregate fiscal policy shocks. Third, we provide a more
precise measure of unanticipated shocks to fiscal policy. Specifically, we have collected and
converted into electronic form the quarterly forecasts of fiscal and aggregate variables from the
University of Michigan’s RSQE macroeconometric model. We also use information from the
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the forecasts prepared by the staff of the Federal
Reserve Board (FRB) for the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We
include these forecasts in the SVAR to purge fiscal variables of “innovations” that were
predicted by professional forecasters. We find that the forecasts help explain a considerable
share of the fiscal innovations, and that controlling for this predictability increases the size of
estimated multipliers in recession.
The next section of the paper lays out the basic specification of our regime-switching
model. Section 2 presents basic results for this model for aggregate spending. Section 3

We prefer introducing regime switches in a SVAR rather than in a DSGE model since it is difficult to model slack
in the economy and potentially non-clearing markets in a DSGE framework without imposing strong assumptions
regarding the behavior of households and firms. In contrast, SVAR models require fewer identifying assumptions
and thus are tied more easily to empirical reality.

results for our method of controlling for expectations. Section 5 concludes.

I. Econometric specification
To allow for responses differentiated across recessions and expansions, we employ a regime
switching vector autoregression model where transitions across states (i.e., recession and
expansion) are smooth. Our estimation approach, which we will call STVAR, is similar to
smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models developed in Clive W. Granger and Timo
Teravistra (1993). One important difference between STAR and our STVAR, however, is that
we allow not only differential dynamic responses but also differential contemporaneous
responses to structural shocks.
The key advantage of STVAR relative to estimating SVARs for each regime separately is
that with the latter we may have relatively few observations in a particular regime – especially
for recessions – which makes estimates unstable and imprecise. In contrast, STVAR effectively
utilizes more information by exploiting variation in the degree (which sometimes can be
interpreted as the probability) of being in a particular regime so that estimation and inference for
each regime is based on a larger set of observations. Note that, to the extent we estimate
properties of a given regime using in part dynamics of the system in another regime, we bias our
estimates towards not finding differential fiscal multipliers across regimes. 4
Our basic specification is:

Coutinho Pereira and Silva Lopes (2010) employ an alternative approach based on estimating a VAR with time
varying coefficients (TVCs) where VAR coefficients are assumed to follow uncorrelated random walks and
estimation is done by Bayesian methods. The variation of coefficients over the business cycle in Coutinho Pereira
and Silva Lopes (2010) is small most likely because (1) Bayesian methods tend to smooth the path of TVCs; and (2)
modeling dynamics as uncorrelated random walks leaves the variation in TVC unrelated to the state of the business
cycle in any structurally meaningful way. In contrast, we allow for an explicit and systematic variation of the
response over the business cycle.

As in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), we estimate the equation using quarterly data and set
𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 = [𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′ in the basic specification where G is log real government (federal, state, and

local) purchases (consumption and investment) 5, T is log real government receipts of direct and
indirect taxes net of transfers to businesses and individuals, and Y is log real gross domestic
product (GDP) in chained 2000 dollars. 6,7 This ordering of variables in 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 means that shocks in

tax revenues and output have no contemporaneous effect on government spending. As argued in
Blanchard and Perotti (2002), this identifying minimum-delay assumption may be a sensible
description of how government spending operates because in the short run government may be
unable to adjust its spending in response to changes in fiscal and macroeconomic conditions. 8
The model allows two ways for differences in the propagation of structural shocks: a)
contemporaneous via differences in covariance matrices for disturbances 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ; b) dynamic
via differences in lag polynomials 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿) and 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿). Variable z is an index (normalized to have

5

We use the traditional approach of defining G to include direct consumption and investment purchases, which
excludes the imputed rent on government capital stocks. While the current U.S. method of constructing the national
accounts now includes imputed rent, this was not the case for most of our sample period. Although the historical
national accounts have been revised to conform to the new approach, we cannot do this for our series of professional
forecasts. Therefore, we utilize the traditional method of measuring G in order to have series that are consistent over
time.

6

To compute G and T, we apply the GDP deflator to nominal counterparts of G and T. We estimate the equations in
log levels in order to preserve the cointegrating relationships among the variables. An alternative but more complex
approach would be to estimate the equations in differences and include error correction terms.

7

We find similar results when we augment this VAR with variables capturing the stance of monetary policy.

In principle, identification can be further strengthened by using sign restrictions. However, given the complexity of
the model and our interest in point estimates rather than ranges, we leave this alternative for future research.

unit variance so that 𝛾𝛾 is scale invariant) of the business cycle, with positive z indicating an

expansion. Adopting the convention that 𝛾𝛾 > 0, we interpret 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿) as describing the

behavior of the system in a (sufficiently) deep recession (i.e., 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) ≈ 1) and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 and 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿) as

describing the behavior of the system in a (sufficiently) strong expansion (i.e., 1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) ≈ 1).

We date the index z by t-1 to avoid contemporaneous feedbacks from policy actions into whether
the economy is in a recession or an expansion.
The choice of index z is not trivial because there is no clear-cut theoretical prescription
for what this variable should be. We set z equal to a seven-quarter moving average of the output
growth rate. The key advantages of using this measure of z are: i) we can use our full sample for
estimation, which makes our estimates as precise and robust as possible; ii) we can easily
consider dynamic feedbacks from policy changes to the state of the regime (i.e., we can
incorporate the fact that policy shocks can alter the regime). 9
Although it is possible, in principle, to estimate {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } and 𝛾𝛾

simultaneously, identification of 𝛾𝛾 relies on nonlinear moments and hence estimates may be

sensitive to a handful of observations in short samples. Granger and Teravistra (1993) suggest
imposing fixed values of 𝛾𝛾 and then using a grid search over 𝛾𝛾 to ensure that estimates for

{𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } are not sensitive to changes in 𝛾𝛾. We calibrate 𝛾𝛾 = 1.5 so that the

9

We also considered, as an alternative, the James Stock and Mark Watson (1989) coincident index of the business
cycle (now maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and called Chicago Fed National Activity Index).
This series dates only to the mid-1960s and cannot be used for endogenous-regime multiplier calculations, but a
potential benefit is that it incorporates more information than the growth rate of real GDP. However, our alternative
estimates using this index (not shown) suggest that the choice between the two definitions of z does not have a
qualitatively important impact on our empirical results.
More generally, we chose the (moving average of) the output growth rate over typical measures of the output gap for
several reasons. First, there is disagreement about which measure of the gap to use and we did not want our analysis
to hinge on this point of contention. Second, it is much easier to compute feedback from policy to state for growth
rates than for filtered series corresponding to the output gap (e.g., consider the two-sided lead/lag transforms
necessary for computing HP filtered series). Third, the gap tends to lag recessions substantially; that is, the
economy can be quickly expanding while the gap is still be large.

economy spends about 20 percent of time in a recessionary regime (that is, Pr(𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) > 0.8) =
0.2) where we define an economy to be in a recession if 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) > 0.8. 10 This calibration is

consistent with the duration of recessions in the U.S. according to NBER business cycle dates
(21 percent of the time since 1946). Figure 1 compares the dynamics of 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) with recessions
identified by the NBER.

Given the highly non-linear nature of the system described by equations (1)-(5), we use
Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods developed in Victor Chernozhukov and Han Hong (2003)
for estimation and inference (see the Appendix for more details). Under standard conditions, this
approach finds a global optimum in terms of fit. Furthermore, the parameter estimates as well as
their standard errors can be computed directly from the generated chains.
When we construct impulse responses to government spending shocks in a given regime,
we initially ignore any feedback from changes in z into the dynamics of macroeconomic
variables. 11 In other words, we assume that the system can stay for a long time in a regime. The
advantage of this approach is that, once a regime is fixed, the model is linear and hence impulse
responses are not functions of history (see Gary M. Koop, Hashem Pesaran, and Simon M. Potter
(1996) for more details). However, we do consider later the effect of incorporating changes in z
as part of the impulse response functions, recomputing z consistently with the predicted changes
in output.

When we estimate {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } and 𝛾𝛾 simultaneously, we find point estimates for 𝛾𝛾 to be above 5 to 10
depending on the definitions of variables and estimation sample. These large parameter estimates suggest that the
model is best described as a model switching regimes sharply at certain thresholds. However, we prefer smooth
transitions between regimes (which amounts to considering moderate values of 𝛾𝛾) because in some samples we have
only a handful of recessions and then parameter estimates for {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } become very imprecise.

10

11

Alternatively, one can interpret this approach as ordering z last in the VAR and setting all z to a fixed value.

7

Most of the impulse response functions and multipliers we present below are for changes
in government purchases, G, and its components. While, primarily for the purpose of
comparison with previous studies, we present some results for changes in taxes in the Appendix
(Figure A1), we have several reasons for focusing on G. First, much of the debate in the SVAR
and DSGE literatures has been about the effects of government purchases. Second, we are less
confident of the SVAR framework as a tool for measuring the effects of tax policy, because (as
discussed above) many of the unexpected changes in T may not arise as a result of a policy
change, but rather as a result of a change in the relationship between tax revenues and aggregate
activity, and because we would expect the effects of tax policy to work through the structure of
taxation (e.g. marginal tax rates) rather than simply through the level of tax revenues. Finally,
identification of tax shocks depends on our ability to purge innovations in revenues of automatic
responses to output and, as discussed in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), the key ingredient here is
the elasticity of revenue with respect to output. However, this elasticity is likely to vary over the
cycle, thereby introducing a bias of unknown magnitude and direction in our regime-specific
estimates. Indeed, we have found that output responses to tax shocks in different regimes are
very sensitive to the assumed elasticity.

II.

Basic Aggregate Results

We begin by considering the effects of aggregate government purchases in the linear model with
no regime shifts or control for expectations, following the basic specification of Blanchard and
Perotti (2002), including the same ordering [𝐺𝐺 𝑇𝑇 𝑌𝑌] for the Cholesky decomposition. Our

sample period is 1947:1—2008:4. Figure 2 displays the resulting impulse response functions
(IRFs) for a government purchase shock. These multipliers demonstrate by how many dollars
output, taxes, and government purchases increase over time when government purchases are
8

increased by $1. 12 In this and all subsequent figures, the shaded bands around the impulse
response functions are 90 percent confidence intervals. 13 Consistent with results reported in
previous studies (see, for example, the survey by Robert E. Hall, 2009), the maximum size of the
government spending multiplier in the linear VAR model (the first column in Figure 2) is about
0.9 and this maximum effect of a government spending shock on output is achieved after a short
delay. The response of future government purchases also peaks after a short delay, indicating
that the typical government spending shock during the sample period is of relatively short
duration. Taxes fall slightly in response to the increase in government purchases. This fall in
taxes may contribute to the positive impact on output that persists even as the increase in
government purchases dies off over time.
The second and third columns of Figure 2 plot the corresponding IRFs with associated
error bands in recessions and expansions, respectively. Because of the smaller effective number
of observations for each regime, particularly for recessions, the confidence bounds are greater for
these IRFs than for those for the linear model in the first column of Figure 2. Even with these
wide bands, however, the responses in recession and expansion are quite different. In both
regimes, the impact output multiplier is about 0.5, slightly below that estimated for the linear
model. Over time, though, the IRFs diverge, with the response in expansions never rising higher
and soon falling below zero, while the response in recessions rises steadily, reaching a value of
over 2.25 after 20 quarters. The strength of this output response in recession is not attributable
simply to differences in the permanence of the spending shock or the tax response. Taxes
actually rise in recession, while falling in expansion. This difference, which is consistent with

12

Because government purchases and output enter the estimated equations in logs, we scale the estimated IRFs by
the sample average values of Y/G to convert percent changes into dollar changes.

13

The Appendix discusses our method of estimating these confidence intervals.

9

the automatic responses of tax collections to changes in output, should weaken the differences in
the observed output responses in recession and expansion; and while the government spending
shock is more persistent in recession, it is stronger in the short run in expansion. 14
To put the magnitudes of these multipliers in perspective, consider multipliers in
Keynesian models as well as the more recent DSGE literature. Traditional Keynesian (IS-LMAS) models usually have large multipliers since the size of the multiplier (when accommodating
monetary policy keeps the interest rate from rising) is given by 1/(1 − 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) where 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 is the

marginal propensity to consume which is typically quite large (about 0.5-0.9). 15 To the extent
that the AS curve in the IS-LM-AS model is upward sloping, the multiplier can vary from
relatively large (the AS curve is flat and there is a great deal of slack in the economy; i.e., in a

recession) to relatively small (the AS curve is steeply upward sloping and the economy operates
at full capacity; i.e., in an expansion). In contrast, an increase in government spending in
modern business cycle models usually leads to a large crowding out of private consumption in
recessions and expansions and correspondingly the typical magnitude for the multiplier is less
than 0.5 (in many cases much smaller). Recent findings from DSGE models with some
Keynesian features (e.g., Lawrence Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo. 2009,
Gauti Eggertsson 2008, and Michael Woodford 2011), however, suggest that the government
spending multiplier in periods with a binding zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates
(which are recessionary times) could be somewhere between 3 and 5. Intuitively, with the

14

Note that the contemporaneous responses of output to a shock in government spending are similar in recessions
and expansions. This result suggests that the differences in the magnitudes of the multipliers across regimes are
driven by the differences in the dynamics (i.e., {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}) rather than in the covariance of error terms (i.e.,
{𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 }).
15

For example, Shapiro and Joel Slemrod (2003) and David S. Johnson, Jonathan A. Parker and Nicholas S.
Souleles (2006) report that the marginal propensity to consume out of (small) tax rebates in 2001 EGTRRA was
somewhere between in 0.5 and 0.7.

10

binding zero lower bound, increases in government spending have no effect on interest rates and
thus there is no crowding out of investment or consumption, which leads to large multipliers. Of
course, our estimates are based on several periods of recession and not just the recent episode
during which the ZLB became an important issue.
In short, our estimates of the government spending multiplier in recessions and
expansions are largely consistent with the theoretical arguments in both (old) Keynesian and
(new) modern business cycle models. Table 1 summarizes these output multipliers for the cases
just considered, as well as those that follow. The table presents multipliers measured in two
ways. The first column gives the maximum impact on output (with standard errors in the second
column) and the third column (with standard errors in the fourth column) shows the ratio of the
sum of the Y response (to a shock in G) to the sum of G response (to a shock in G). The first
measure of the fiscal multiplier has been widely used since Blanchard and Perotti (2002). The
second measure has been advocated by Woodford (2011) and others since the size of the
multiplier depends on the persistence of fiscal shocks. Regardless of which way we compute the
multiplier, it is much larger in recessions than in expansions.
The differences between our regime-based multipliers probably are exaggerated by our
assumptions that the regimes themselves don’t change and that we consider settings
corresponding to very strong expansions or recessions. Hence, one should interpret reported
magnitudes of the multipliers for the two regimes as bounds from polar settings rather than
routinely encountered values. More realistic situations will fall between the extremes. For
example, if the multiplier is smaller in expansion than in recession and the economy has a
positive probability of shifting from recession to expansion in future periods, then the actual
multipliers starting in recession (or expansion) should be a blend of those estimated for the

11

separate regimes. Calculating full dynamic impulse response functions that include internally
consistent regime shifts is complicated, because we must compute the index z and evaluate the
function F(z) at each date along the trajectory. Also, because the IRFs are now nonlinear, they
will depend on the initial value of the index z and the size of the government policy shock. For
example, the more deep the initial recession, and the less positive the spending shock, the less
important future regime shifts out of recession will be. Therefore, we must specify the initial
conditions and the size of the policy experiment in order to estimate the dynamic IRFs.
Figure 3 presents estimates for the historical effects of shocks to government purchases
on output, incorporating regime shifts in response to government spending shocks. For each
period, we consider a policy shock equal to one percent increase in G and report a dollar increase
20
in output per dollar increase in government spending over 20 quarters (i.e., ∑20
ℎ=1 𝑌𝑌ℎ /∑ℎ=1 𝐺𝐺ℎ ).

The size of the multiplier varies considerably over the business cycle. For example in 1985, an
increase in government spending would have barely increased output. In contrast, a dollar
increase in government spending in 2009 could raise output by about $1.75. Typically, the
multiplier is between 0 and 0.5 in expansions and between 1 and 1.5 in recessions. Note the size
of the multiplier tends to change relatively quickly as the economy starts to grow after reaching a
trough. Thus, the timing of changes in discretionary government spending is critical for
effectiveness of countercyclical fiscal policies.

III.

Results for Components of Spending

Just as output multipliers for government purchases differ according to the regime in which they
occur, they can also differ for different components of government purchases (see e.g. Perotti
2007). As discussed earlier, studies using the narrative approach tend to focus on military build-

12

ups, but how useful are these shocks to defense spending in analyzing the effects of other
changes in spending policies, such as those adopted during the recent recession?
Figure 4 shows that IRFs for output in response to defense and non-defense spending
shocks, based on a four-variable VAR including defense and non-defense purchases, as well as
output and taxes. We order the Cholesky decomposition with defense spending first and nondefense spending second, although this does not have an important effect on the results. 16
Clearly, the IRFs have different shapes for the linear model. For a unit shock to defense
spending, output rises immediately by just over 1, which is consistent with Ramey (2011), and
then gradually falls. For non-defense spending, the output effect starts smaller but eventually
exceeds 1 and remains above 0.6 for the entire period shown. Once the results are broken down
by regime, however, we can see a much stronger dependence on the regime of the defense
spending IRFs, which are similar to the linear-model results for the case of expansion but much
more positive in recession, peaking at about 5 in the fifth quarter after the shock. For nondefense spending, on the other hand, the differences between regimes are primarily with respect
to timing rather than size, with the most positive responses occurring rapidly in expansions but
with several quarters’ delay in recessions.
Figure 5 shows the results of an experiment that breaks government purchases down in a
different way, into consumption and investment spending, with consumption ordered first. 17
Once again, the results differ considerably by regime and by spending component. In this
decomposition, both components of spending have positive effects on output in the linear model,
although the effects of investment spending are much stronger, particularly during the first few

quarters when the impact on output exceeds 2 for investment but is around 0.5 for consumption.
Estimating the IRFs separately for recession and expansion leads in general to the expected result
of more positive multipliers in recession than in expansion. The IRFs are also noisier for the
separate regimes, indicating an imprecision of these point estimates that is consistent with the
larger confidence intervals (see appendix figures).

IV.

Controlling for Expectations

As emphasized by Ramey (2011) and others, the timing of fiscal shocks plays a critical role in
identifying the effect of fiscal shocks. In spirit of Ramey (2011), we control for expectations not
already absorbed by the VAR using real-time professional forecasts from three sources. First,
we draw forecasts for output and government spending variables from the Survey of Professional
Forecasters (SPF), an average of forecasts (with the number of individual forecasters ranging
from 9 to 50) available since 1968 for GDP and since 1982 for government spending and its
components. Second, for government revenues, we use the University of Michigan RSQE
econometric model, for which forecasts are available for the period beginning in 1982. 18 Third,
we use government spending (Greenbook) forecasts prepared by the FRB staff for FOMC
meetings. The Greenbook forecasts for government spending are available from 1966 to 2004.
Since the FOMC meets 8 or 12 times a year in our sample, we take Greenbook forecasts
prepared for the meeting which is the closest to the middle of the quarter to make it comparable
to SPF forecasts. Since the properties of the Greenbook and SPF forecasts are similar, we splice
the Greenbook and SPF government spending forecasts and construct a continuous forecast
series running from 1966 to present. For each variable, we use the forecast made in period t-1

year in the fire that destroyed that university’s Economics Department building.

for the period-t value. Because there have been numerous data revisions in the National Income
and Product Accounts since the dates of these forecasts, we use forecast growth rates rather than
levels.
The importance of controlling for expectations is illustrated in Figure 6, which plots the
residuals from projecting forecasted and actual growth rates of government spending on lags of
the variables in our baseline VAR. 19 If the VAR innovations were truly unexpected, then these
two residuals would be unrelated, but the correlation between forecasted and actual growth rates
of government spending (net of the information contained in the VAR lags) is about 0.3-0.4
which points to conclusion that a sizable fraction of VAR innovations is predictable. Therefore,
one should be interested in using refined measures of unanticipated shocks to government
spending.
The simplest way to account for these forecastable components of VAR residuals is to
expand the vector Xt to include professional forecasts. That is, if we let the
SPF/Greenbook/RSQE forecasts made at time t-1 for the growth rate of real government
𝐹𝐹
𝐹𝐹
purchases for time t be denoted ∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
(where ∆𝐺𝐺𝑠𝑠|𝑡𝑡
is the growth rate of government spending

G at time s forecasted at time t) and define the professional forecasts for output and taxes the

𝐹𝐹
𝐹𝐹
𝐹𝐹
same way, we would use the expanded vector in equation (1) [∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
∆𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
∆𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′,

stacking the forecasts first because by the timing there is no contemporaneous feedback from

unanticipated shocks at time t to forecasts made at time t-1. 20 This direct approach is attractive
because it accounts automatically for any effects that expectations might have on the aggregate
variables and for the determinants of the expectations themselves. In practice, however, we have

The figure presents two versions of this plot, with similar results, one relating forecast residuals to VAR residuals
based on real-time data, the other to VAR residuals based on final-vintage data.

found this approach to be too demanding given our data limitations, for it doubles the number of
variables in the VAR while eliminating more than half of the observations in our sample (i.e.,
those before 1982); the resulting confidence intervals are very large, particularly for the
recession regime for which we have effectively fewer observations. 21,22
We consider two alternative approaches. The first alternative is a two-step process. The
first step of this process is to create “true” innovations by subtracting forecasts of the vector Xt
from Xt itself. We then fit 𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 = 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 �1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 )� + 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 ) (i.e., equation (3)) using these
forecast errors (rather than the residuals from the VAR itself). From this step, we use estimated

𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 and 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 to construct contemporaneous responses to shocks in expansions and recessions. The
second step involves using the previously-estimated baseline VAR with regime switches. In this
step, we use the estimated coefficients 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿) and 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿) to map the propagation of

contemporaneous responses created in the first step. This two-step approach has the advantage
of allowing us to base the VAR on our full sample and the original number of variables. Its main
disadvantage is that the IRF dynamics will not necessarily be correct, given that the VAR is
estimated under the assumption that the innovations to Xt are fully unanticipated.
The second alternative approach is to augment the baseline VAR directly, but with only
one variable, pertaining to the forecast of government spending. For example, the vector of
𝐹𝐹
� 𝑡𝑡 = [𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′ where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 is
� 𝑡𝑡 = [∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
variables in the VAR could be 𝐗𝐗
𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′ or 𝐗𝐗

the forecast error for the growth rate of government spending or some other measure of news
about government spending. In the former specification, an innovation in 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 orthogonal to
21

We do consider a more restricted version of this approach shortly, in which we add a series on defense spending
innovations available for our full sample directly to the VAR.

22

Karel Mertens and Morten O. Ravn (2010) distinguish anticipated and unanticipated shocks in a VAR by using
long-run restrictions combined with calibration. We do not use this strategy in part because with regime switches
we cannot distinguish long-run responses in expansions and recessions.

16

𝐹𝐹
∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
is interpreted as an unanticipated shock. In the latter specification, an innovation in the

forecast error or news about government spending is interpreted as an unanticipated shock. 23

The key advantage of this approach is that, with sufficiently long series, we can have a VAR of a
manageable size and yet we can remove directly a predictable component from government
spending innovations.
With these alternative approaches and specifications, unanticipated shocks to government
spending of a given initial size will lead to differing government spending responses over time.
To make IRFs comparable, we normalize the size of the unanticipated government spending
shock so that the integral of a government spending response over 20 quarters is equal to one.
Therefore the interpretation of the fiscal multipliers is similar to the second column in Table 1.
Figure 7 shows the IRFs for different approaches and specifications and contrasts these results
with the results for the baseline specification (1)-(5) that does not control for the predictable
component in government spending innovations. Table 1 reports the maximum and average
multipliers along with associated standard errors.
Panel A (Figure 7) presents IRFs for the first approach. The results suggest that
controlling for expectations increases the absolute magnitudes of the government spending
multipliers, making them more positive in recessions and more negative in expansions. Panel B

the spliced Greenbook/SPF forecast series for the growth rate of government spending. In this

specification, which is estimated on the 1966-2009 sample, the multiplier in the recession regime

23

In principle, these two variants should be the same, but this will not be exactly so because of data revisions. That
is, we have real-time predicted changes, real time actual changes, and ex post actual changes. The difference
between last two changes will be allocated to one piece or the other depending on which variable is included in the
regression.

is a bit larger than in the baseline model while the multiplier in the expansion regime stays
positive but small which contrasts with the baseline model where the multiplier turns negative at
long horizons. By and large, these results suggest that the government spending multiplier in
recessions increases and the multiplier in expansions stays close to zero when we purify
government spending shocks of predictable movements.
� 𝑡𝑡 = [𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′
Panel C (Figure 7) shows results for the second approach with 𝐗𝐗

where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 is the forecast error computed as the difference between spliced Greenbook/SPF

forecast series and actual, first-release series of the government spending growth rate. 24 In this

specification, an unanticipated shock to government spending in an expansion has an effect on
output similar to the effect we find in the baseline model at short horizons. In a recession,
however, the multiplier may be larger than in the baseline model, especially at short horizons,
but the standard errors for estimated output response are also rising which probably reflects the
fact that forecast errors capture only a fraction of the variation in government spending.
Finally, we use spending news constructed in Ramey (2011) to control for the timing of
fiscal shocks (Panel D, Figure 7). Specifically, we augment the baseline VAR with Ramey’s
spending news series, which is ordered first in this expanded VAR. The key advantage of using
Ramey’s series is that, in contrast to the forecast series, it covers the whole post-WWII sample
(1949:1-2008:4) and thus allows a longer estimation period and more precise estimates. One
limitation of Ramey’s news shocks is that they are based only on military spending. But changes
in military spending do account for a large share of variation in total government spending, so
they should still be informative. Also, these shocks are dominated by major historical events

24
An advantage of using real-time data to compute forecast errors is that it makes forecasts and actual series refer to
the same concept of government spending.

18

such as the Korean War which can make multiplier estimates sensitive to using alternative
samples. Panel D shows that controlling for spending news does not materially affect output
responses during expansions and raises responses in recessions, although increased standard
errors call for cautious interpretation of these estimated impulse responses. We view these
findings as corroborating our other evidence on the importance of constructing unanticipated
fiscal shocks, which tend to have larger effects on output in recessions.

V.

Concluding remarks

Our findings suggest that all of the extensions we developed in this paper – controlling for
expectations, allowing responses to vary in recession and expansion, and allowing for different
multipliers for different components of government purchases – all have important effects on the
resulting estimates. In particular, policies that increase government purchases have a much
larger impact in recession than is implied by the standard linear model, even more so when one
controls for expectations, which is clearly called for given the extent to which independent
forecasts help predict VAR policy “shocks.” Given the historical experience of the U.S.
economy, our preferred estimates of the government spending multiplier are between 0 and 0.5
in expansions and between 1 and 1.5 in recessions.
While we have extended the SVAR approach, our analysis still shares some of the
limitations of the previous literature. We have allowed for different economic environments, but
there may be still other important differences among historical episodes that we lump together,
for example recessions, such as the recent one, associated with financial market disruptions and
very low nominal government interest rates, and other recessions induced by monetary
contractions (such as the one in the early 1980s). Our predictions are also tied to historical
experience concerning the persistence of policy shocks, and therefore may not apply to policies
19

either less or more permanent. The effects of taxes, even if purged of expected changes, are still
probably too simple as they fail to take account of the complex ways in which structural tax
policy changes can influence the economy. And, finally, as we enter a period of unprecedented
long-run budget stress, the U.S. postwar experience, or even the experience of other countries
that have dealt with more acute budget stress 25, may not provide very accurate forecasts of future
responses.
These limitations of our analysis should motivate future theoretical work to develop
realistic DSGE models with potentially nonlinear features to understand more deeply the forces
driving differences in the size of fiscal multipliers over the business cycle, the role of
(un)anticipated shocks for fiscal multipliers in these environments, and implications of levels of
government debt for the potency of discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.

The model is estimated using maximum likelihood methods. The log-likelihood for model (1)(5) is given by:

nonlinear and has many parameters 𝚿𝚿 = {𝜸𝜸, 𝛀𝛀𝑹𝑹 , 𝛀𝛀𝑬𝑬 , 𝚷𝚷𝑹𝑹 (𝑳𝑳), 𝚷𝚷𝑬𝑬 (𝑳𝑳)}, using standard optimization

routines is problematic and, thus, we employ the following procedure.

{𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}. Thus, for a given guess of {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 }, we can estimate {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)} with

The procedure iterates on {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } (which yields Π and the likelihood) until an optimum is

reached. Note that with a homoscedastic error term (i.e. 𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐), we recover standard VAR
estimates.

Since the model is highly non-linear in parameters, it is possible to have several local
optima and one must try different starting values for {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 }. To ensure that 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 are

23

positive definite, we use 𝚿𝚿 = {𝛾𝛾, 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ), 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ), 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}, where chol is the

operator for Cholesky decomposition. Furthermore, given the non-linearity of the problem, it
may be difficult to construct confidence intervals for parameter estimates as well as impulse
responses. To address these issues, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method
developed in Chernozhukov and Hong (2003; henceforth CH). This method delivers not only a
global optimum but also distributions of parameter estimates.
We employ the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm to implement CH’s estimation method.
Specifically our procedure to construct chains of length N can be summarized as follows:
Step 1: Draw 𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) , a candidate vector of parameter values for the chain’s n+1 state, as

𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) = 𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) + 𝛙𝛙(𝑛𝑛) where 𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) is the current n state of the vector of parameter values in
the chain, 𝛙𝛙(𝑛𝑛) is a vector of i.i.d. shocks taken from 𝑁𝑁(𝟎𝟎, 𝛀𝛀𝛙𝛙 ), and 𝛀𝛀𝛙𝛙 is a diagonal

matrix.

Step 2: Take the n+1 state of the chain as
𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) with probability min�1, exp�log 𝐿𝐿�𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) � − log 𝐿𝐿�𝚿𝚿(𝑛𝑛) ���
𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛+1) = �
𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) otherwise

where 𝐿𝐿�𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) � is the value of the objective function at the current state of the chain and

𝐿𝐿�𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) � is the value of the objective function using the candidate vector of parameter
values.

The starting value 𝚿𝚿 (0) is computed as follows. We approximate the model in (1)-(5) so that the
model can be written as regressing 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 on lags of 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 , 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 , 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡2 . We take the residual from this
regression and fit equation (3) using MLE to estimate 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 . These estimates are used as

staring values. Given 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 and the fact that the model is linear conditional on 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ,

we construct starting values for lag polynomials {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)} using equation (A3).

The initial Ω𝜓𝜓 is calibrated to about one percent of the parameter value and then adjusted

on the fly for the first 20,000 draws to generate 0.3 acceptance rates of candidate draws, as
proposed in Andrew Gelman et al. (2004). We use 100,000 draws for our baseline and

robustness estimates, and drop the first 20,000 draws (“burn-in” period). We run a series of
diagnostics to check the properties of the resulting distributions from the generated chains. We
find that the simulated chains converge to stationary distributions and that simulated parameter
values are consistent with good identification of parameters.

estimates in the generated chain.

𝑁𝑁

Furthermore, we can use the generated chain of parameter values �𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 to construct

confidence intervals for the impulse responses. Specifically, we make 1,000 draws (with
𝑁𝑁

replacement) from �𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 and for each draw we calculate an impulse response. Since
𝑁𝑁

columns of 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) in �𝚿𝚿(𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 are identified up to sign, the generated chains
for 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) can change signs. Although this change of signs is not a problem
for estimation, it can sometimes pose a problem for the analysis of impulse responses. In
particular, when there is a change of signs for the entries of 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) that

correspond to the variance of government spending shocks, these entries can be very close to
zero. Given that we compute responses to a unit shock in government spending and thus have to
divide entries of 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) that correspond to the government spending shock by

the standard deviation of the government spending shock, confidence bands may be too wide.

To address this numerical issue, when constructing impulse responses, we draw {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}

directly from �𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 while the covariance matrix of residuals in regime s is drawn from

Notes: The figures show impulse responses to a $1 increase in taxes. To control for the automatic tax response to contemporaneous output shocks,
we follow Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and use their estimate of 2.08 for the elasticity of tax revenues with respect output. The shaded region is the
90% confidence interval. Dashed lines show the responses in expansionary (red, long dash) and recessionary (blue, short dash) regimes. The solid
line with circles shows the response in the linear model.

Notes: The figures show impulse responses to a $1 increase in government consumption spending. Shaded region is the 90% confidence interval. Dashed lines show the responses
in expansionary (red, long dash) and recessionary (blue, short dash) regimes. The solid line with circles shows the response in the linear model.
