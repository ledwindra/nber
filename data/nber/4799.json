    "abstract": "\n\nWe use disaggregated data on trade flows, production, and trade barriers for 41 countries in 1988 to examine the political and economic determinants of non-tariff barriers, as well as the impact of protection (both tariff and non-tariff) on trade flows.  We use an econometric framework that allows for the simultaneous determination of trade barriers and trade flows.  Our results are consistent with political-economy theories of the determinants of protection: even after accounting for industry-specific factors, nations tend to protect industries that are weak, in decline, and threatened by import competition.  Countries also give more protection to large industries; these might be thought of as politically important.  Nations use tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and exchange rate controls as complementary instruments of protection.\n\n",
