ABSTRACT
The Producer Price Index (PPI) for the United States suggests that semiconductor prices have barely
been falling in recent years, a dramatic contrast from the rapid declines reported from the mid-1980s
to the early 2000s. This slowdown in the rate of decline is puzzling in light of evidence that the
performanceof microprocessor units (MPUs) has continued to improve at a rapid pace. Roughly
coincident withthe shift to slower price declines in the PPI, Intel — the leading producer of MPUs —
substantially changed its pricing behavior for these chips. As a result of this change, we argue that
the matched-model methodology used in the PPI for MPUs likely started to be biased in the mid2000s and that hedonic indexes can provide a more accurate measure of price change since then. Our
preferred hedonic index of MPU prices tracks the PPI closely through 2004. However, from 2004 to
2008, our preferred index fell faster than the PPI, and from 2008 to 2013 the gap widened further, with
our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 43 percent, while the PPI declined at only an
8 percent rate. Given that MPUs currently represent about half of U.S. shipments of semiconductors,
this difference has important implications for gauging the rate of innovation in the semiconductor
sector.

1. Introduction
How fast are semiconductor prices falling? Data from the Producer Price Index (PPI) published
by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that prices of microprocessor units (MPUs) have
barely been falling in recent years. This very slow rate of price decline stands in sharp contrast
to the rapid declines in MPU prices reported from the mid-1980s up to the early 2000s and the
exceptionally rapid declines in the latter half of the 1990s. If accurate, the apparent slowdown in
MPU price declines in recent years would be troubling, given the long-run relationship between
rates of price decline of semiconductors and the pace of innovation in that sector. 1
A stalling out of innovation in this sector likely would have broader implications for the
economy, as semiconductors are an important general-purpose technology lying behind advances
of the digital revolution, including machine learning, robotics, big data, and massive
connectivity. 2 Given this connection, adverse developments in the semiconductor sector could
damp the growth potential of the overall economy. 3 On the other hand, if technological progress
and attendant price declines were to continue at a rapid pace, powerful incentives would be in
place for continued development and diffusion of new applications of this general-purpose
technology. Such applications could both enhance the economy’s growth potential and push
forward the ongoing automation that has generated concerns about job displacement. 4
The apparent slowdown in the rate of price decline is puzzling given evidence that the
performance of MPUs continued to improve at a rapid pace after the mid-2000s. The key to
resolving the puzzle may reside in another development in the semiconductor industry. Roughly

coincident with the shift to a slower pace of price decline in the PPI, Intel — the leading MPU
producer — dramatically changed its pricing behavior. Prior to the mid-2000s, Intel generally
lowered the list prices of existing chips to remain competitive with newly-introduced chips on a
price-performance basis. However, after the mid-2000s, Intel shifted to a new paradigm in
which it largely kept the list prices of existing chips unchanged.
This change in Intel's behavior could resolve the puzzling disconnect between continuing
improvements in MPU performance and the shift to slower price declines. Namely, we argue
that the matched-model methodology used by BLS is not well suited to capturing price trends in
a pricing regime like the one that has prevailed since the mid-2000s. In such a pricing regime, if
performance is improving over time, then matched-model price indexes for MPUs such as the
PPI likely are biased. We argue that a specific hedonic index ― one based on prices for newlyintroduced models ― is better suited to capturing price trends in these circumstances and
develop new hedonic indexes for quality-adjusted prices using price data for Intel MPUs from
2000 to 2013.
Our preferred index of MPU prices tracks the PPI closely from 2000 to 2004. However,
from 2004 to 2008 — roughly the period of transition to Intel’s new pricing regime — our
preferred index fell faster than the PPI. And from 2008 to 2013, the gap widened further, with
our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 43 percent, while the PPI declined at only
an 8 percent rate.
An important innovation in the paper is that the hedonic regressions utilize measures of
MPU performance on typical tasks for computer users rather than technical variables capturing
physical characteristics (such as feature size) and engineering specifications (such as clock
speed). Performance measures provide a superior control for quality change when constructing

-2-

price indexes for MPUs because they gauge the actual output obtained by a user rather than the
input characteristics used to produce that output. Moreover, with rapid changes in MPU
architecture in recent years, identifying the correct set of technical characteristics (and likely
changes in that set) could be challenging.
To gauge whether our measure of user performance matters empirically, we also estimate
parallel hedonic regressions with technical characteristics as the controls for chip quality. The
price indexes generated by the two approaches are strikingly different after 2004. The declines
in the indexes based on technical characteristics slowed sharply from that point forward, much
like the PPI. After 2004, clock speed ― which had been highly correlated with user
performance ― stopped rising in response to problems with heat generation, but Intel continued
to boost performance in other ways. The hedonic regressions we estimated with technical
characteristics evidently cannot capture the ongoing gains in performance, which translates into
slower declines in constant-quality prices. This result highlights the importance of using direct
measures of performance when estimating hedonic price regressions.
This paper focuses on MPUs rather than a broader set of semiconductor products, a
choice we made for several reasons. 5 First, MPUs are a large segment of the semiconductor
sector; in 2014, they represented about half of U.S. shipments (the scope of the PPI). Second,
price series for MPUs extend back to the mid-1980s, allowing for comparisons of price trends
over time. Given that price trends in this sector often are used to infer rates of technical
progress, this historical comparability is important. Finally, we believe that developments in

Among all MPUs, this paper analyzes prices of the MPUs used in desktop personal computers (PCs), for which
data are the most readily available. In other work, we are developing indexes for MPUs going into servers, the types
of machines that would support cloud computing in server farms and other processor-intensive applications. In
addition, Dan Sichel’s undergraduate thesis student, Sophie (Liyang) Sun (2014) developed price indexes for MPUs
used in laptop computers.

MPU technology likely provide a rough guide to developments in other parts of the
semiconductor sector, such as the chips that are used in smartphones and tablets. 6
Our work on MPU prices builds on important earlier research. Much prior work on
semiconductor prices relied on technical characteristics of the chips to control for quality.
Notable studies that have used this approach to construct hedonic price indexes for
semiconductors (or computing equipment that embeds these chips) include Cole et al. (1986),
Grimm (1998), and Flamm (2007).
Although the technical characteristics used in these studies are correlated with
performance, they may not fully capture the capabilities of the processor for end users. For this
reason, Triplett (1989) and Berndt and Griliches (1993) called for analysis of computer prices
with controls for more refined measures of performance. 7 In this vein, Chwelos (2000 and 2003)
constructed hedonic price indexes for PCs with controls for the results of a suite of benchmark
performance tests. 8
An alternative approach has been to measure semiconductor prices with matched-model
indexes. Aizcorbe, Corrado, and Doms (2003) found that under certain circumstances (highly
granular data on model prices and high-frequency observations), a matched-model index may
produce similar results to a hedonic index. Such highly granular data were used by the Federal
Reserve Board for its MPU price index through 2006, which was constructed as a matchedmodel index. The source data used by the Fed were discontinued after 2006. However, even if

6

The market for chips going into smartphones and tablets is changing rapidly, and it is challenging to obtain
consistent time series on prices and performance. That being said, the production processes and technologies are
similar enough to those for MPUs that developments in MPUs likely provide at least a rough gauge of developments
in these other types of chips.
7
See pages 147 and 91, respectively.
8
In addition, Holdway (2001) examined unit value MPU price indexes using benchmark test scores as a measure of
quality-adjusted units of computing power. Grimm (1998) developed specifications that controlled for millions of
instructions per second (MIPS); this measure of performance, however, has limited ability to account for differences
across MPUs in the translation of instructions into program execution.

-4-

those data were still available, the issues explored in this paper suggest that the matched-model
approach would be problematic for more recent years.
This paper extends the existing literature in two main ways. First, we develop hedonic
price indexes for MPUs that control for quality with performance measures based on typical
tasks performed by end users. Second, we use these hedonic price indexes to assess the
possibility that the PPI has been understating the price declines for MPUs.
The next section highlights the puzzle raised by the very slow rate of decline in the PPI
during recent years at the same time that the engineering frontier for MPUs continued to move
out rapidly. This section also discusses the change in the pricing pattern of Intel MPUs that
occurred in the mid-2000s. Section 3 presents our argument that hedonic price indexes are likely
to better capture price trends than are matched-model indexes (such as the PPI) since that
change. Section 4 reviews our data, which cover the period from 2000 to 2013. In section 5, we
describe the hedonic regressions used to obtain measures of quality-adjusted prices. Section 6
presents our results, and section 7 concludes.

2. The Puzzle
As noted, the PPI for MPUs has fallen very slowly in recent years. This section explores the
plausibility of this extreme slowdown from two different perspectives. The first perspective is
whether the slowdown meshes with the trends in technological advance for MPU chips. The
second perspective focuses on the changes that occurred in Intel's pricing patterns for MPUs,
developments that, as we show below, have important implications for price index measurement.

Technology cycles and chip performance. 9 The standard definition of a semiconductor
technology cycle is the amount of time required to achieve a 30 percent reduction in the width of
the smallest feature on a chip. Because chips are rectangular, a 30 percent reduction in both the
horizontal and vertical directions implies about a 50 percent reduction (0.7*0.7) in the area
required for the smallest chip component. As documented in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013),
the semiconductor industry has achieved massive reductions in scaling over time. Indeed, the
area occupied by a chip component in 2012 was roughly 200,000 times smaller than in 1969.
There is a broad consensus that the pace of technical advance in the semiconductor
industry sped up in the mid-1990s, a development first brought to the attention of economists by
Jorgenson (2001). Table 1 reports the average length of the semiconductor technology cycle (as
defined above) for various periods. For the industry as a whole, the technology cycle averaged
three years until 1993 and then dropped to about two years from 1993 to 2012. Within the later
period, the scaling advances were especially rapid from 1993 to 2003 and a bit slower after 2003.
Even so, the average cycle since 2003 has remained substantially shorter than the three-year
cycle in effect before the 1990s. For Intel's MPU chips, there has been no pullback at all from
the two-year cycle. The upshot is that the cycles in semiconductor technology ― a key driver of
quality improvement in IT products ― have remained rapid. 10
While the pace of miniaturization has been sustained, semiconductor producers have
changed the approach used to translate these engineering gains into faster performance.
Historically, each new generation of technology in semiconductors allowed for an increase in the

10
These continuous increases in chip density are the force behind Moore's Law, which states that the number of
components on leading-edge chips will double every two years. Moore's original formulation (Moore, 1965) pegged
the doubling time at only one year, but in 1975 he revised the period to be two years based on the actual experience
to that point (Intel Corporation, 2005). For a discussion of the outlook for Moore's Law, see Bauer, Veira, and Weig
(2013).

number of basic calculations performed per second (clock speed) for a given chip design.
However, as speed continued to increase, dissipating the generated heat became problematic. In
response, Intel shifted away in the early to mid-2000s from increases in clock speed and boosted
performance instead by placing multiple copies of the core architecture on each chip — a change
enabled by smaller feature size — and by improving the design of those cores. 11
How did this strategy shift affect the rate of increase in performance for end users? For
the period through 2008, Pillai (2013) addressed this question with performance scores from the
Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). 12 These scores are based on standard
tasks designed to reflect the needs of computer users. Figure 1 extends Pillai’s analysis through
2013, plotting average SPEC performance measures for MPUs introduced each year. 13 Starting
in 2004, the figure includes a second SPEC performance measure (the "rate" score) that
incorporates more fully the performance gain from using multiple cores than does the standard
("speed") measure. 14
Figure 1 confirms Pillai's finding that MPU performance gains cooled around 2001 from
the extraordinary pace in the 1990s, though the rate of advance has, nonetheless, remained
substantial through 2013. Using the SPEC rate measure that accounts more completely for the
effects of parallel processing, SPEC performance rose about 32 percent per year on average from
2000 to 2013, down from the 60 percent rate of improvement from 1990 to 2000 and the 36
percent pace over the earlier 1971-90 period (not shown). The figure also plots clock speed for

stalled out during this period (figure 1.11, p. 24).

benchmark suites SPEC® CPU2006 and SPEC® CPU2000. The SPEC score for each year is the average over the
Intel desktop MPU chips introduced in that year. Details are provided in section 4 and in appendix A.

Intel desktop MPUs, highlighting that performance continued to improve even as clock speed
stalled out in the early to mid-2000s. 15
Historically, improvements in the engineering frontier have translated into steep declines
in MPU prices. Figure 2 shows the annual price declines back to 1986, splicing together
estimates from Grimm (1998) through 1992, the Federal Reserve Board for 1993-97, and the PPI
for later years. Over this period, MPU prices fell at an average rate of nearly 30 percent per year,
with especially sharp drops in the second half of the 1990s. However, reported price declines
have slowed dramatically over the past several years. Indeed, the declines in each year since
2010 were smaller than in any prior year back to 1986, breaking the link with the continued
engineering improvements. Perhaps the cost of achieving these engineering advances has
accelerated in recent years. If that were the case, we might expect to see a similar price pattern
for other types of semiconductor chips. No such pattern, though, is evident for memory chips
(DRAMs). 16 As shown in figure 3, DRAM prices have been quite volatile from year to year,
with no clear trend toward slower declines. At least for DRAMs, then, the translation of the
engineering frontier to prices does not appear to have changed.
All in all, the shift to much slower price declines for microprocessors in the PPI is a
puzzle in light of the continued substantial improvements on the engineering front. We next
consider the possibility that changes in the properties of Intel’s posted prices after 2006 could
have distorted the measurement of price trends in the PPI.

15

During the first half of the 1990s, performance also increased more rapidly than did clock speed. Hennessy and
Patterson (2012) discuss this pattern; see the note to their figure 1.11.
16
The most important driver of DRAM performance is the size of the components on the chip, which has continued
to shrink rapidly, as discussed above. See Flamm (1993) for a discussion of characteristics of DRAM chips.

Intel's pricing behavior and market position. Between 2003 and 2006, the properties of
Intel’s posted prices for MPU chips changed dramatically. 17 Prior to 2003, the price of a specific
Intel MPU model tended to drop fairly rapidly in the year or two following its introduction,
especially once a new, higher performance model became available. By 2006, this pattern had
completely changed; the posted price of a specific model tended to remain constant, even after a
new, higher performance model became available at a similar price.
Figure 4 illustrates this shift in pricing behavior. The upper panel shows Intel wholesale
list prices for all desktop models during 2000-01, while the lower panel shows the analogous list
prices for all desktop models during 2011-12. The difference between the two panels is stark. In
the early period, prices fell steeply over a model’s lifecycle. However, by 2011-12, the price
paths are flat or nearly so, with only a few instances of sizable price declines. Figure 5
summarizes this change in life-cycle pricing over the entire 2000-12 period by showing the share
of all Intel desktop MPU models introduced in each year that experienced a price decline within
four quarters of introduction. 18 As can be seen, every model introduced in 2000 and 2001 had at
least one such price cut. But the share then dropped to about 60 percent for the 2004 to 2009
cohorts and took another leg down thereafter, falling to roughly 10 percent for the 2012 cohort.
This shift took place against the backdrop of a changing competitive environment vis-avis AMD, Intel’s primary challenger in the MPU market. Figure 6 plots Intel's annual revenue
from all products (not only MPUs) as a share of Intel's and AMD's combined revenue. Over this
20-year period, Intel's revenue share ranged from just under 80 percent to slightly above 90
percent. In 2002 and 2003, Intel's share stood at the top of this range but then eroded

17

While the BLS does not indicate which companies’ prices are included in the PPI for MPUs, it is only reasonable
to assume that Intel is included given its dominant market position. Moreover, it appears that BLS has been making
at least some use of Intel’s posted prices for MPUs (see Holdway, 2001).
18
The price data in the figure are described in section 4.

-9-

significantly through 2006. Nosko (2010) also documented this share erosion, noting that from
2002 to 2006, AMD "consistently released products whose price/performance characteristics
were similar to or beat Intel's" (p. 8). Documents from legal actions against Intel for alleged
antitrust violations (see, for example, State of New York v. Intel Corporation, 2009) also provide
evidence that Intel was concerned about its losses of market share to AMD during this period.
However, in 2006, Intel began to turn the corner by offering new MPUs that dominated
those sold by AMD (see Nosko, 2010, for details) and subsequently pulled ahead of AMD in a
decisive way, consistent with the recovery in Intel's overall revenue share. By 2013, Intel's
dominance had reached the point that AMD effectively had been relegated to the bottom end of
the MPU market. Indeed, as shown in figure 7, AMD received more than 85 percent of its MPU
revenue from chips that sold for less than $75, the low-end part of the market where Intel derived
only about 15 percent of its revenue. Conversely, Intel received almost 30 percent of its MPU
revenue from chips that sold for $200 or more, a segment in which AMD earned no revenue. 19
This evidence indicates that Intel has enhanced its position in the MPU market since
2006. With less competition from AMD, Intel has greater scope to manage its price structure. 20
By keeping list prices essentially fixed over a chip's life cycle, Intel may be attempting to extract
more revenue from price-insensitive buyers while offering discounts on a case-by-case basis to
other customers. Such price discrimination could reduce the information content of its posted
list prices, potentially biasing the quality-adjusted indexes generated from these prices. The next

19

Figure 7 slightly overstates the market separation between Intel and AMD for the following reason. The source
data used to construct the figure show the average selling prices for distinct product families (Intel's Core i5 Duo, for
example) rather than prices for individual chips. Within each product family, there is some amount of unobserved
price variation. The average selling price for AMD's most expensive product family, the FX-8, was less than $200
in 2013, but two chips in this family (the FX-9590 and the FX-9370) were priced between $200 and $500 at
introduction in July 2013 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_FX_microprocessors). These isolated
cases do not affect the general point that Intel dominates the high end of the MPU market.

section investigates the properties of matched-model and hedonic indexes in the post-2006
pricing environment.
3. Constructing MPU Price Indexes
As noted, the changes in the pattern of Intel’s posted MPU prices raise important questions for
price measurement. Can a matched-model index correctly capture price trends given Intel’s new
pricing regime? If not, what approach to price measurement is likely to deliver estimates that
are most robust to possible measurement error in prices? Finally, in an environment with rapid
gains in MPU performance and changes in chip architecture, what are the best ways to measure
quality change for MPUs?
In this section, we investigate these questions and make the case that — given the new
pricing regime for MPUs that emerged in the mid-2000s — hedonic indexes are preferable to
matched-model indexes. In addition, we argue that, given possible measurement error and
current limitations on data availability, hedonic regressions that rely only on prices in the period
of a model’s introduction are likely to be more robust than hedonic regressions that include
prices over a chip's entire life cycle. We also argue that hedonic indexes using actual measures
of performance have important advantages over those using variables capturing physical
characteristics of MPUs.
Matched-model or hedonic? To fix ideas, we briefly describe the matched-model and
hedonic approaches to price measurement (see Aizcorbe, 2014, for a recent, in-depth treatment
of this topic). Matched-model indexes control for quality change between two periods, say
period 0 and period 1, by averaging price changes for models that were in the market in both
periods. The underlying idea is to measure “pure” (or quality-adjusted) price change for products
whose quality did not change because they were in the market in both periods 0 and 1.

- 11 -

Hedonic price indexes identify “pure” price change by explicitly controlling for quality
change with measures of product characteristics or performance. The hedonic approach
regresses prices on these measures, with the price change left after controlling for quality taken
to be the quality-adjusted price change. Many alternative specifications have been proposed for
hedonic regressions. Perhaps the simplest is to include time dummy variables (time fixed
effects) in the hedonic regression and to read off quality-adjusted price change from the
coefficients on the time dummies. (We discuss in section 5 our preferred specification for the
new price indexes in this paper.)
To illustrate why we prefer hedonic over matched-model indexes for MPUs, we use
stylized examples of Intel’s pricing behavior to highlight the implications of the shift in
behavior. Panel A of figure 8 illustrates the pricing pattern for Intel MPUs prior to the mid2000s in which the price of each MPU model falls as it ages; this panel is a stylized version of
the actual price cascade for 2000-01 shown previously. When a new, higher-quality model is
introduced, the price of the old model falls so that price per unit of quality is at least roughly
equalized across models. In this case, the gap between model prices in periods when two models
are in the market would represent the value of improved quality, and a matched-model index
would correctly adjust for this quality change.
Panel B shows a scenario in which prices of incumbent models do not fall when new,
higher-quality models are introduced — a stylized version of the actual price cascade we
presented for 2011-12. Given the upward trend in chip quality, price per unit of quality in panel
B is falling as new models are introduced. However, a matched-model index would indicate that
quality-adjusted prices are constant because the price of each model stays the same as it ages.
Thus, a matched-model index would give a biased read of trends in quality-adjusted prices.

- 12 -

In contrast, a hedonic index that used appropriate measures of quality would correctly
capture price trends even in the scenario in Panel B. In that scenario, prices are not changing,
but the quality measure in the hedonic regression would account for the improvement in priceperformance ratios when new models are introduced, and a hedonic index would show a
downtrend in quality-adjusted prices reflecting the decline in price per unit of quality.
These scenarios illustrate why we believe that matched-model indexes will generate
biased price trends in the period following the shift in Intel’s pricing behavior, and why we
believe that hedonic indexes are more likely to correctly capture price trends for MPUs.
Introduction-period or full-sample hedonic regressions? A natural starting point would
be to assume that hedonic regressions should be estimated using all available data. However,
under certain circumstances, a full-sample regression can lead to biased estimates of price
change. For example, in the 1980s some researchers constructed price indexes for mainframe
computers using only introduction-period prices for each model. This choice was made because
of concerns that available IBM list prices for older models might not be actual transaction prices
(see Cole et al., 1986).
We believe a similar concern may apply to MPUs. To explain why, we consider two
possible explanations for what lies behind the pricing pattern adopted by Intel in the mid-2000s.
Panel C of figure 8 shows a stylized scenario in which prices of older models are measured with
error. Specifically, posted list prices in this scenario do not represent true transactions prices
because Intel offers “age-related discounts” to selected purchasers as models age. In this
scenario, new models enter the market at the same list price that exiting models leave the market,
just as in panel B. We now add the dashed lines, which show actual transaction prices. These

- 13 -

lines slope downward, as progressively larger discounts are offered on older models as newer,
higher performance models become available.
In the age-related discounting scenario, a full-sample hedonic index based on observable
posted prices would go astray because the posted prices are measured with error. The actual
transaction prices of each model are falling over time but a full-sample hedonic index would not
account for this measurement error, leading to biased estimates of quality-adjusted price change.
In contrast, the introduction-period hedonic index could correctly capture trends in
quality-adjusted prices if age-related discounts were offered as in panel C. 21 In particular, the
introduction-period hedonic would omit observations in which prices were measured with error,
and the performance variables in the regression would control for improvements in quality in
successive periods.
Panel D highlights another scenario (“Drop-off in volume”) that also could create
challenges for a full-sample hedonic index. In this scenario, posted prices do not change, but in
contrast to panel C, we assume they represent actual transaction prices. With this pricing
assumption, the quantity purchased of a model drops off as it ages and faces competition from
newer, more powerful models with lower prices per unit of quality. The solid, heavier line
represents the early, high-quantity part of each model’s life cycle and the thinner line represents
the later part when sales have dropped. If model-level data on shipments or sales were available,
a shipments- or sales-weighted index would account for the declining importance of the older
model. However, model-level quantity data are not readily available. Accordingly, we (and
other researchers) are forced to consider price indexes that put equal weight on every
observation.
21

The introduction-period index would capture price trends even if list prices at the time of introduction do not
represent actual transactions prices provided that discounts at the time of introduction do not vary systematically
over time or across models.

- 14 -

In the scenario illustrated in panel D, an unweighted full-sample hedonic index would put
too much weight on price observations for which there were few transactions. In contrast, an
unweighted introduction-period hedonic index likely would do a better job of capturing the trend
in quality-adjusted prices. By focusing on prices at the beginning of each model’s life-cycle, a
regression that applies equal weights to all observations avoids over-weighting models whose
quantities have dropped off.
For the reasons described here, we emphasize introduction-period hedonic indexes,
although we also report full-sample indexes. Our preference does not reflect a belief that
introduction-period indexes are inherently better, but rather the view that introduction-period
indexes are likely to be more robust to the data limitations that hamper efforts to estimate recent
trends in quality-adjusted MPU prices. In particular, we believe that an introduction-period
hedonic will be more robust to measurement error in list prices (the age-related discount
scenario) and to a lack of model-level shipments data that prevents the use of weighted
regressions (the drop-off in volume scenario).
Performance measures or physical characteristics in hedonic regressions? A longrecognized challenge facing hedonic methods has been the choice of variables to include in the
regression to control for quality. The typical approach has been to include measures of key
physical characteristics of each model, in the belief that these characteristics will serve as a
proxy for what purchasers value. This approach has raised concerns in the past, and researchers
have called for the inclusion of actual performance measures rather than physical characteristics
(see Triplett, 1989, and Berndt and Griliches, 1993). The underlying logic behind using
performance measures is to focus on the output received by users rather than the input
characteristics used to generate that output. For many products, measures of performance are

- 15 -

unavailable so there is little choice but to use characteristics. For MPUs, however, measures of
performance — specifically for the types of tasks actually undertaken by users — are available
as described above. Moreover, specifying an appropriate hedonic regression and finding suitable
data can be difficult for a rapidly evolving product, and using directly measured performance
helps to address this problem.
Accordingly, in this paper, we develop hedonic indexes with performance measures from
SPEC that avoid the difficulties entailed in trying to capture quality for MPUs with rapidly
changing architecture by identifying relevant physical characteristics. Our preferred
performance metrics are described in detail in the next section.
4. Data
Prices and SPEC scores. Our MPU prices are collected from publicly available Intel
price lists for the period from 1999 to 2013. 22 Intel announces wholesale list prices several times
a year for MPUs sold in multiples of 1,000. Unlike single units sold in retail channels, these
“trays” of MPUs do not include a cooling system and carry a shorter warranty. Models are
identified by family (for example, Core i7, Pentium, Core 2 Duo), model ID (for example, i74960X), and selected technical characteristics (for example, amount of cache memory or clock
speed). We merged these price lists to create price data at a quarterly frequency. We restrict our
attention to the 373 MPU models for desktop computer systems introduced between 2000 and
2013.
To measure the relative quality of different chips we use the performance scores from
SPEC that were mentioned in section 2. (These benchmark tests are described in detail in

22

Price lists for the period from April 1999 to December 2006 were collected from an archived version of a website
devoted to computer hardware. Price lists for later dates were obtained directly from Intel’s website. On dates when
both sources were available, we confirmed that the website prices matched Intel price lists.

appendix A.) Briefly, SPEC scores evaluate performance of an MPU on individual tasks that
rely heavily on integer computation (such as word processing) and on tasks that rely heavily on
floating point computation (such as speech recognition). Scores for individual tasks are
measured in seconds, although SPEC rescales these scores so that higher scores indicate better
performance and the units are no longer in seconds. SPEC provides an overall score both for
integer and for floating-point computation, which are calculated as geometric means of scores for
12 integer computation tasks and 17 floating-point computation tasks, respectively. To construct
a single measure of performance, we take the geometric mean of the overall scores for integer
and floating-point tasks. 23
SPEC scores are widely used to compare the performance of alternative MPUs or
computers and also are used as a standard by computer engineers. 24 For example, Hennessy and
Patterson (2012) — the standard text on computer design and architecture — notes that “One of
the most successful attempts to create standardized benchmark application suites has been the
SPEC (Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation) …” (p. 38). This textbook relies on
SPEC scores to measure the growth in processor performance in recent decades. 25
SPEC benchmarks provide several ways to measure MPU performance. The
performance of a single task is measured by the “speed” score and the simultaneous performance
of multiple tasks is measured by the “rate” score. The “speed” and “rate” scores differ in their
use of parallel processing, an important consideration after the introduction of multi-core MPUs
in the mid-2000s. In the “speed” test, a single task may be broken into component calculations
to be run on different processing cores on the MPU. In the “rate” test, multiple instances of the
23

Although the integer and floating-point scores could be included as separate variables in the hedonic regressions
described below, little would be gained relative to the equal-weighted geometric mean, as the correlation between
the two scores is greater than 0.98.

same task may be run simultaneously to more fully exploit the potential of the chip. We use the
“speed” score as our base case, but the results using the “rate” score (available from the authors)
are very similar.
Sample selection. We matched 184 MPU models from our price data, or 49 percent, to at
least one performance score published by SPEC. An important question is whether this selection
on the availability of SPEC scores could bias our results. Table 2 provides information on this
point, showing a range of chip characteristics both for chips with SPEC scores and for those
without scores. 26 As shown in Panel A of the table, average entry prices for chips with SPEC
scores are considerably higher than for chips without SPEC scores. Perhaps not surprising given
the difference in average prices, chips with SPEC scores tend to have technical features
associated with higher performance. Clock speed is somewhat greater for chips with SPEC
scores; the shift to multicore architecture occurred more quickly; and the amount of power used
by the chip (thermal design power 27) is greater. For the most part, these differences in technical
features taken individually are not very large, and there is no consistent difference in the final
characteristic shown in the panel ― the size of the smallest feature on the chip (lithography).
For our purposes, the essential issue is whether price trends differ across the samples of
chips with and without SPEC scores. To examine this question, we construct matched-model
indexes using the PPI methodology (labeled PPI-like) for both samples. As shown in Panel B of
the table, over the full period from 2000 to 2013, the average rate of decline in these PPI-like
price indexes is very similar across the chips with and without SPEC scores (29 percent versus
26 percent, respectively). The two sets of chips also display similar price trends within the

shorter time periods shown in the table. The similarity of the price trends suggests that our
results are not biased by the absence of SPEC scores for some chip models.
Representativeness of our sample relative to the PPI. A second important question is
how well price trends in our sample track those in the PPI. Our sample is for Intel desktop chips,
while the scope of the PPI includes desktop chips from other manufacturers (notably including
AMD), as well as chips for servers and laptops. As can be seen in Panel B, our PPI-like indexes
for Intel desktop chips and the PPI for all MPUs display very similar price trends. Accordingly,
we are comfortable using our results for Intel desktop chips to draw inferences about the
performance of the PPI.

5. Specification of the Hedonic Regressions
To fix ideas, we first describe a dummy-variable hedonic specification:
ln�𝑃𝑖,𝑡 � = 𝛼 + ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 + ∑𝑡 𝛿𝑡 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡

(1)

where Pi,t is the price of chip i in period t, Xk,i,t is the value of characteristic k for chip i in period t
(measured in logs or levels, as appropriate), Di,t∈Y is a vector of time dummy variables (fixed
effects) that equals 1 if chip i is observed in period t and zero otherwise, and εi,t is an error term.
A potential shortcoming of equation 1, highlighted by Pakes (2003) and Erickson and
Pakes (2011), is that the coefficients on the characteristic or performance variables are
constrained to remain constant over the full sample period. One response to that concern is to
run a cross-section regression for every time period and then to use results from those
regressions to build up a price index. 28 Such an approach is appealing because it provides
maximum flexibility for estimated coefficients to change over time and allows the results to be

28

See Aizcorbe’s (2014) discussion and the references there.

- 19 -

used in price index formulas. However, our sample size is too small to run reliable cross-section
hedonic regressions for every quarter or even every year.
As a compromise, we focus on adjacent-period (in our case, adjacent-year) hedonic
regressions. 29 Specifically, we estimate the following regression for each two-year overlapping
period:
ln�𝑃𝑖,𝑡 � = 𝛼 + ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛿𝐷2 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡

(2)

where Pi,t is the price of chip i in year t. We measure Pi,t as the average of the observed prices of
chip i within the year. 30 The dummy variable D2 equals 1 if the price observation is in the second
year of the two-year overlapping period and 0 otherwise. To construct a price index from this
sequence of regressions, we spliced together the percent changes implied by the estimated
coefficients on the D2 variables. In our main results, we rely on the SPEC variable to capture the
performance of each MPU as experienced by users, so that ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 reduces to 𝛽ln(𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝑖,𝑡 ).
As noted in the previous section, SPEC updated its suite of performance tests in 2006.

We use the older (SPEC 2000) benchmarks for the adjacent-year regressions through 2005-06
and the newer (SPEC 2006) benchmarks for the adjacent-year regressions beginning with 200607.
As a comparison, we also estimate equation 2 with a set of chip characteristics on the
right-hand side instead of the SPEC variable. This alternative regression represents the usual
approach to hedonic specification in the literature and allows us to gauge the effect on estimated
price trends of controlling directly for performance. The characteristics included in the
regression are those shown in table 2 ― clock speed (in gigahertz), number of cores, maximum
29

See Triplett (2006) for a discussion of adjacent-period hedonic regressions.
We also estimated regressions at the quarterly frequency for each two-year period and included a time trend
spanning the eight quarters of data included in each regression. That alternative yielded price trends similar to those
reported here.
30

- 20 -

thermal design power (in watts), and lithography size (in nanometers) ― plus cache memory (in
megabytes), a dummy for whether the chip has a separate graphics processing unit, and the
number of threads. 31 We use the natural log of clock speed, thermal design power, lithography
size, and cache memory; the number of cores and number of threads enter the regression in
levels.
6. Results
Table 3 shows estimates of equation 2 using SPEC performance for the overlapping two-year
periods during 2000-06, and table 4 shows estimates for 2006-13. The upper panel in each table
presents estimates that rely only on prices in each MPU model’s introduction period, while the
lower panel presents estimates based on the full sample of price observations. The coefficient on
the second-year dummy variable in each adjacent-year regression measures the rate of change in
quality-adjusted MPU prices from the first year to the second.
Overall, the regressions explain much of the variation in MPU prices. The adjusted R2
averages close to 0.50 across the full set of regressions shown in tables 3 and 4.
Although Pakes (2003) cautions against providing structural interpretations of the
coefficients, we note that the coefficients on SPEC performance are uniformly positive and
significant at the 5 percent level. These coefficients indicate that higher performing MPU
models sell for higher prices and suggest that the performance measure captures an important
element of the quality differences across MPU models.
Analogous tables for the regressions that replace SPEC performance with chip
characteristics are provided in appendix C. These regressions fit the data well, with an average
adjusted R2 of about 0.75. Some of the estimated coefficients are in line with expectations. In
31

MPUs can perform multiple threads—sequences of related program instructions—either by employing multiple
cores or by sharing resources on an individual core. Thus, additional threads provide a form of parallel processing.

- 21 -

particular, the coefficients on clock speed, number of threads, and cache memory are generally
positive and significant, with no instances of significant negative coefficients. In contrast, the
significant coefficients on thermal design power, number of cores, lithography, and the graphics
processor dummy change sign at least once. In addition, the significant coefficients on the
graphics processor dummy are generally negative. Overall, these regressions exhibit the
interpretational issues that often attend hedonic regressions estimated with a vector of product
characteristics. 32
To construct annual price indexes from the SPEC and characteristics regressions, we set
the 2000 value of the index to 100, and then move the index forward year by year with the
implied percent change from each adjacent-year regression. For example, to calculate the
percent change from 2000 to 2001, we exponentiate the coefficient on the year dummy in the
2000-01 regression. 33 We then do the same for the 2001-02 regression, and so on.
We summarize our results in table 5 and figure 9. The table reports average rates of price
change over 2000-04, 2004-08, and 2008-13 from six different measures: the hedonic index
based on SPEC performance and introduction-period prices (our preferred index), three other
hedonic indexes including those using chip characteristics, the MPU price index constructed by

32

For completeness, we also estimated a version of the hedonic regression that included both SPEC performance
and chip characteristics as controls for quality. The results were not crisp, as might be expected given the inclusion
of both a summary measure of performance and chip features that influence the summary measure. In particular, the
coefficient on SPEC performance was positive and significant in less than half of the regressions and insignificant in
the rest. The coefficients on the characteristics, though broadly similar to the characteristics-only regression,
displayed more frequent instances of significant changes in sign.
33
Because the exponential function is nonlinear, the translation from the natural log of prices to price levels requires
an adjustment in order to be unbiased. We apply the standard adjustment based on the estimated variance of the
regression error; see Aizcorbe (2014) for details. This adjustment had very little effect on estimated price trends
over 2000-04, but over 2004-08 and 2008-13 it slowed the estimated annual rate of price decline by as much as 10
percentage points relative to the unadjusted estimates.

the Federal Reserve Board, and the PPI. 34 The figure plots the levels of the PPI and the two
hedonic indexes based on SPEC performance.
From 2000 to 2004, all of the indexes show very rapid declines in MPU prices. As
discussed in section 3, with Intel’s ubiquitous downward re-pricing of existing chips before the
mid-2000s, all of the price indexes—both matched model and hedonic—would be expected to
capture the downward trend in quality-adjusted prices. This expectation is borne out by our
results. As shown in table 5, all of the MPU price indexes fell at an average annual rate of 39
percent or more over 2000-04. In addition, the rate of decline in the PPI (and the Fed’s index) is
very similar to that of our preferred hedonic index.
However, the trends in the indexes diverge after 2004. Although our preferred hedonic
index fell somewhat less rapidly after 2004 than before, the decline in the PPI slowed much more
sharply. Indeed, the PPI fell at an average annual rate of only 8 percent from 2008 to 2013 and
barely declined at all in 2012 and 2013. For the reasons highlighted earlier in the paper, we
believe that this divergence points to likely bias in the PPI for MPUs and suggests that the PPI
could be providing a deeply misleading picture of price trends for MPUs in recent years. 35
The full-sample hedonic index based on SPEC performance declined less rapidly than the
introduction-period index in each period, with the largest difference occurring after 2008. As
indicated by the analysis in section 3, the wider gap after the mid-2000s is what would be
expected under the “age-related discounting” and “drop-off in volume” scenarios if Intel were
keeping posted prices for older models fixed to a greater degree than previously. Because
34

The Federal Reserve series is a matched-model index from 1992 to 2006 linked to an introduction-period hedonic
index after 2006. The hedonic index is constructed from an earlier version of the empirical work presented here.
35
In a closely related study, Sun (2014) estimated hedonic regressions for MPUs used in laptops. Because SPEC
scores were not available for a wide enough set of laptop chips, Sun used a variety of other performance benchmarks
in the regressions. She found that prices for laptop MPUs trended down at a 20 to 30 percent average annual pace
over past ten years, depending on the regression specification. The rate of price decline slowed after 2010, though
not to the extent shown by the PPI.

- 23 -

discounts from posted prices are unobservable, the full-sample index will understate price
declines to the extent that Intel is discounting older models; this bias will be larger than when
posted prices were more flexible. Moreover, to the extent that Intel is allowing priceperformance ratios on older models to rise above those for new models, sales of the older models
likely are falling off more substantially than when posted prices fell over a chip's life cycle.
Given that we do not have model-level shipments data, the index based on the unweighted fullsample index would overweight the older models whose prices are not changing. Under either
scenario (or a combination of them), the full-sample hedonic index will understate the rate of
price decline, supporting our preference for the introduction-period index. 36
The post-2004 slowing in estimated price declines is much more pronounced in the
regressions that use chip characteristics than in those using SPEC performance. As shown in
table 5, during 2004-08 and 2008-13, the price indexes obtained from the characteristics-based
regressions fell at average annual rates ranging from only 1 percent to 21 percent, a far slower
rate of decline than in the corresponding SPEC-based indexes.
The wide gap stems from the post-2004 divergence between the continued performance
gains indicated by SPEC scores and the flat path for chip quality implied by the characteristics
regression (which we demonstrate below). With no quality improvement, the characteristics
regression "thinks" that constant-quality prices are no longer falling more rapidly than observed
list prices.

36

As a robustness check for the introduction-period SPEC regression, we estimated an alternative version that
included not only chip prices in the quarter of introduction but also prices in the three quarters following the chip’s
introduction. The price index obtained from this regression fell at a (bias-adjusted) annual rate of 38 percent, 34
percent, and 39 percent, respectively, over 2000-04, 2004-08, and 2008-13. Thus, MPU price declines are estimated
to have remained rapid whether we use only the introduction-period price or broaden the sample to include prices
observed within a year of introduction.

- 24 -

To measure the implied change in chip quality over time, recall from equation 2 that the
effect of quality on the log of observed chip price in the adjacent-year regression is ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋𝑘,𝑖,𝑡 .
Letting 𝑡1 and 𝑡2 denote the first and second of the two adjacent years, the average value of the
quality effect for the chips that appear in the regression in 𝑡1 is ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 , with an analogous

expression for 𝑡2 . Thus, the change in the quality effect from 𝑡1 to 𝑡2 is ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 �. 37
36F

When SPEC performance is used as the sole control for chip quality, this expression reduces to
𝛽�𝑋�𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑡1 �, where X is ln(SPEC). It is important to note that ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 � measures
the effect of quality change on prices, not the pure change in quality itself. However, on the

reasonable assumption that higher quality is associated on average with higher chip prices, the
sign of ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 � indicates whether chip quality is improving, worsening, or
remaining unchanged, which is sufficient for our purpose.

Figure 10 shows the time series for the price effect of chip quality, measured from each
adjacent-year regression as ∑𝑘 𝛽𝑘 �𝑋�𝑘,𝑡2 − 𝑋�𝑘,𝑡1 �, with each year-pair then linked together to

form the time series. The 𝛽 coefficients and the average chip characteristics are both taken from

the introduction-period version of the regressions, and thus represent the price effect of quality at
the frontier. As can be seen, the SPEC-based series rises every year, implying a sustained
increase in chip quality; this result is consistent with the direct measure of SPEC performance
that was shown previously in figure 1. In contrast, the series based on chip characteristics in
figure 10 only edges up on net after 2003, implying little effect on prices of the improvement in
chip quality from that year forward, punctuated by a sizable decline in 2008. Interestingly, the
characteristics-based series in figure 10 bears a striking resemblance to the series for clock speed
37

Aizcorbe (2006) also measures the price effect of changes in chip quality. Although her method involves taking
the difference between the changes in observed prices and quality-adjusted prices, algebraically this is very close to
what we do.

- 25 -

in figure 1. Thus, even though the characteristics-based regression includes seven MPU
characteristics, clock speed exerts a powerful influence on the implied measure of chip quality in
the regression.
These results raise questions about the constant-quality MPU price indexes obtained from
the regressions that control for quality with chip characteristics. To view those indexes as
credible, one must accept either that the quality of MPU chips was essentially stagnant for the
decade after 2003 or that the market placed no value on rising performance over that decade.
The second condition is implausible on its face, while the first implies that the upward march in
chip quality indicated by SPEC ratings — the industry standard for performance measurement —
is spectacularly wrong. The much more likely conclusion, in our view, is that chip performance
has continued to improve and that constant-quality MPU prices have remained on a steep
downtrend.

7. Conclusion
After falling rapidly through the mid-2000s, the PPI for MPUs has declined very slowly by
historical standards in recent years. Such a slowdown is puzzling given evidence of ongoing
rapid advances in semiconductor technology. To reconcile these observations, this paper
demonstrates that the matched-model procedure used for the PPI for MPUs likely is
inappropriate in the pricing regime that Intel — the dominant manufacturer — adopted in the
mid-2000s. We argue that a hedonic approach based on introduction-period prices is the
preferred way to measure quality-adjusted MPU prices in the current pricing environment. We
implement this hedonic approach with an MPU performance measure that addresses

- 26 -

longstanding concerns in the literature about the use of product characteristics to proxy for
performance.
The results from our preferred hedonic price index indicate that quality-adjusted MPU
prices continued to fall rapidly after the mid-2000s, contrary to the picture from the PPI. Our
results have important implications for understanding the rate of technical progress in the
semiconductor sector and, arguably, for the broader debate about the pace of innovation and its
implications in the U.S. economy. Notably, concerns that the semiconductor sector has begun to
fade as an engine of growth appear to be unwarranted. Rather, these results suggest continued
rapid advances in technologies enabled by semiconductors.
That said, it is important to highlight that our results have limited direct implications for
the measurement of real GDP or output per hour. Semiconductors mostly are intermediate inputs
and so are not counted directly in GDP. Imports and exports are the exception, but trade
quantities are small enough that, even if our preferred price indexes for MPUs were adopted,
measures of real GDP growth would change by only a small amount.
As a final point, we note that our results raise a new puzzle. In recent years, the price
index for computing equipment in the National Income and Product Accounts has fallen quite
slowly by historical standards. If MPU prices have, in fact, continued to decline rapidly, why
have prices for computers ― which rely on MPUs for their performance ― not followed suit?
We believe there is a reasonable chance that the official price indexes for computers have been
measured with error, reflecting in part the challenge of identifying the relevant and likely
changing set of physical characteristics used to measure quality. The end-user performance
measure employed in this paper could help break this knot for computer prices, and we are
investigating this possibility in further work.

Appendix A: Performance Measures from SPEC (System Performance Evaluation
Corporation)
As noted in the text, SPEC is a non-profit corporation that develops performance benchmarks for
computers. This appendix describes the performance benchmarks from SPEC that we use in our
analysis.
For MPUs, SPEC has developed a suite of benchmark tests that evaluate how quickly an MPU
can complete a set of tasks that are developed from real user applications. These benchmark
suites are updated periodically to reflect changes in MPU architecture and in relevant tasks. We
use the latest benchmark, called CPU2006, as well as CPU2000.
The performance of an MPU will depend on characteristics of the system other than just the
MPU; these other elements include memory and the compiler used. SPEC has benchmarks for a
standard configuration (“base” metrics) and a configuration in which compilers are tuned for
maximum performance (“peak” metrics). We use the base metrics.
Further details are provided below on how we use the CPU2006 and CPU2000 benchmarks to
construct the performance measure used in our analysis.
CPU2006
CPU2006 was introduced in 2006, and we use results from CPU2006 to measure the
performance of chips from 2006 to 2013. This benchmark consists of two suites of tasks. The
first suite contains 12 tests that focus on integer calculations, and the second suite contains 17
tests that focus on floating point calculations. For each test, SPEC normalizes the test time by
taking the ratio of the test time on a standardized reference machine to the test time for the MPU
being tested. By scaling results in this way, shorter test times result in higher performance
scores. SPEC then constructs a composite score for calculations by taking the geometric mean of
the normalized individual integer scores; SPEC constructs a composite floating-point score in a
parallel manner. The composite scores we use are called SPECint_base2006 and
SPECfp_base2006.
As noted, these tests cover actual user applications. The integer and floating-point applications
include the following.
•

Integer applications include running PERL scripts, file compression, running a C
compiler, combinatorial optimization, artificial intelligence (playing the games Go and
chess), searching gene sequences, simulating a quantum computer, video compression,
discrete event simulation, running path-finding algorithms, and XML processing.

•

Floating-point applications include computations for fluid dynamics, quantum
chemistry, quantum chromodynamics, molecular dynamics, general relativity, finite
element analysis, linear programming, image rendering, structural mechanics,
computational electromagnetics, weather modeling, and speech recognition.

47

To construct the performance measure used for most of our analysis, we take the geometric mean
of the integer and floating-point composites described above.
With the advent of parallel processing, SPEC began distinguishing between speed and rate
measures of performance. Speed measures focus on how fast a computer completes a single
task. Rate measures focus on how many tasks a computer can complete in a given amount of
time, taking advantage of available parallel processing. 38 The integer and floating-point
performance suites described above are speed measures. Our analysis primarily focuses on these
speed measures as they are available over a longer time span. That said, we also consider rate
measures to more fully account for parallel processing and the rise of multicore chips.
CPU2000
CPU2000 was introduced in 1999 and retired in 2007. We use results from CPU2000 to measure
the performance of chips from 2000 to 2006. The calculation of CPU2000 is very similar to that
of CPU2006 except that the individual performance tests are of a type appropriate to the
computing environment in the earlier period. The CPU2000 integer suite includes 12 tests, and
the floating-point suite includes 14 tests.
Just as with CPU2006, for CPU2000, our analysis relies on the geometric mean of the integer
and floating-point composite metrics, which themselves are geometric means of normalized
results of the individual integer and floating-point tests.
Additional Details
We are able to bridge across the SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 benchmarks because results for 2006
were reported on both benchmarks for many chips. This allows us to estimate hedonic
regressions for adjacent pairs of years through 2005-06 using SPEC2000 and for adjacent pairs
of years starting with 2006-07 using SPEC2006.
An MPU chip often has multiple scores for each of the SPEC benchmark tests. Multiple scores
can arise either because more than one computer vendor tested the chip or because a given
vendor tested the chip under different conditions. The variation in test conditions can reflect
differences in hardware (e.g., the circuit board or amount and type of DRAM) or software (e.g.,
the operating system or compiler). When multiple scores are available for a specific model, we
use the model’s median score.

38

Speed scores do account for some parallel processing; in particular, speed scores allow for auto-parallelization for
a single task, and by 2014 almost all speed scores reported using this feature.

48

Appendix B: Intel Desktop MPUs on Wholesale Price Lists
The table below (see next page) lists every Intel desktop MPU shown on the company's
wholesale price lists starting in 1999. The most recent price list is posted at
http://www.intc.com/pricelist.cfm; price lists for earlier periods were collected from this location
and other online sites. Entry year denotes the year that the MPU first appeared on a price list.
The MPU description is taken directly from Intel's ARK database, located at http://ark.intel.com,
which contains a full history of Intel microprocessors; the note at the bottom of the table
describes the minor ways we edited the ARK description to save space. The final column shows
whether a SPEC score exists for each model. All of the models with a SPEC score are included
in our empirical analysis. Of 373 models introduced by Intel during the period, 184 have SPEC
scores available.
