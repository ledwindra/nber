Introduction
The magnitude of marginal costs, and markups over marginal cost are empirical

questions of considerable general interest in economics. Microeconomists are interested in
markups because they bear on such questions as the relevance of alternative models of
imperfect competition, the welfare consequences of market power, and the benefits of new
product introduction. In recent macroeconomic research as well, markups play a central
role. Although macroeconomic discourse most often focuses on the cyclicality rather than
the level of markups, the degree of cyclicality is often limited by the absolute size of the
markup (Rotemberg and Saloner, 1986).
The estimation of markups is difficult because marginal cost is not directly
observable. There are essentially two ways in which inference about markups and
marginal cost is approached in the econometric literature. One approach is via the cost
function, which is either inferred directly from engineering data or estimated from crosssectional or time series market data. The other is to estimate consumer demand functions,
and compute the markup based on estimated demand elasticities, in combination with a
model of market equilibrium.
This paper takes a quite different approach to measurement of marginal costs and
markup ratios. We argue that the price of a “private label” equivalent or near-equivalent
product provides valuable information about the marginal cost of the nationally branded
product. In particular, because the private label version would not sell at a price less than
its marginal cost, the ratio of the price of the branded product to that of the private label
serves as a lower bound on the markup ratio. The high relative price of national brands is
thus indicative of substantial markups over marginal cost.
Underlying our approach is the notion that private label products are more or less
physically identical to nationally branded products, but the branded product commands a
higher market price due to characteristics not related to marginal costs of either
manufacturing or retail handling. Many of the promotional expenses which vertically
differentiate the branded product from its private label counterpart appear largely as sunk,
or at least fixed, costs. Essentially the same is true of expenditure on research and
development. To the extent that marginal costs of private label goods diverge from those

2

of the branded versions, we present evidence that suggests that manufacturing costs for
the private labels are if anything higher on the margin than those for the corresponding
brands.
Informed by the above considerations and in possession of data on both retail prices
and the retailer’s margins over wholesale, we take the wholesale price of the private label
product as an upper bound for the marginal manufacturing cost of its branded counterpart.
The presumption that retailers’margins must at least cover marginal handling costs allows
inference about the contribution of the retail channel to full marginal cost. We present
several ratios that, under reasonable assumptions, bound the true marginal cost of
manufacturing and selling the branded product from above as well as below.
We emphasize the lower bound measure of the true markup. To briefly summarize
our main results, markups computed in this manner are consistent with, but on the high
side of, those found in previous studies, for the few products for which such studies exist.
Markups for national brands sold in supermarkets are large. Lower bounds on markup
ratios measured this way range from 3.44 for toothbrushes and 2.23 for soft drinks to
about 1.15–1.20 for canned tuna and frozen entrees, with the majority of categories falling
in the range 1.40–2.10.
The ratio of brand to private label retail prices has on occasion been used in the
literature as a measure of the markup. The texts by Scherer (1980) and Carlton and
Perloff (1994) present some informally collected data of this sort. A recent paper by Nevo
(1997) computes the retail price ratio as a check on structural estimation of markups on
breakfast cereals, and finds a markup ratio of about 1.30, very much in accord with the
estimates from the structural approach. Our data indicate, in accord with results from
previous studies, that retailers earn higher margins on private labels than on national
brands. This suggests that the retailer’s margin on the branded variety is most likely the
best indicator of actual marginal handling cost at the retail level. If this is the case, ratios
of retail prices understate national brand markups over the “true” marginal cost of
providing goods to the consumer.
We apply our approach to products in the grocery industry, in which there are many

3

“private label” or “store brand” products in a wide variety of categories.1 We compute our
markup ratios using scanner data from the Chicago area supermarket chain Dominick’s
Finer Foods.2 The Dominick’s data include both retail prices and the retailer’s “margin”
(and hence, implicitly, wholesale prices) for both national brands and the store brand. This
allows us to decompose ratios of the retail prices into a manufacturer’s markup and a
retailer’s markup on wholesale prices – an exercise that will prove to be important in our
efforts to bound the “true” markup from above and below. The product descriptions are
sufficiently detailed that we are able to identify many pairs of national brand and private
label offerings that are comparable in both quality and package size.
The paper is structured as follows. In the next section we present our conceptual
framework. In subsection II-a, we present a simple vertical differentiation model
emphasizing the role of sunk advertising costs, consumer heterogeneity, and competition
for “niche” in carving out a role for private labels and determining the size of the
equilibrium markup. In section II-b, we highlight the role of retail stores and point out
how advertising and competition between retailers leads to an inverse relation between
wholesale and retail margins. In section II-c, the most critical part of the analytical
section, we develop a set of inequalities involving the various price ratios, and show how
we can bound the true markup both above and below.
In section III we answer some possible objections about the comparability of national
brand and private label products. Evidence suggests that to the extent that there are
differences, they point in the direction that prices of private label products overestimate
the marginal cost of national brands - suggesting that our assumptions are in fact
conservative. In section IV we introduce the data and discuss measurement methods. In
section V we present five different but related “markup” ratios, covering both the
1

Fitzell (1998) recounts that private labels go back to the late nineteenth century, and gradually
developed from the sale of bulk commodity staples. From the beginning, the main focus of private label
manufacturers has been on packaged goods - packaged teas, sugar, flour, spices, etc. Early in the
twentieth century, private label manufacturers expanded their activity by offering also canned vegetables
and fruits, frozen foods, bakery and dairy products. Later, the private label industry expanded to include
paper products, detergents, deli items, soft drinks, health and beauty care products, and more recently
even “untouchable” products such as cosmetics, baby food, natural health products, and gourmet
delicacies.

wholesale and retail levels, for over 230 comparable nationally branded-private label
product pairs representing 19 categories. Computing the lower bound on markup ratios
developed in section II, we document that the markups for national brands are large. In
section VI we briefly discuss our findings, linking the variation in the magnitude of the
markup ratios to the materials share in production cost. We conclude the paper in section
VII.

II. Inferring Marginal Cost and Markups From Private Labels: Theory
a.

Vertical Differentiation and the Coexistence of Brands and Private Labels
We begin with a very stylized example of a market with two firms, best thought of as

integrated manufacturers and sellers,3 one producing a branded product, the other offering
a physically identical unbranded product. This example is an adaptation of Tirole (1989,
p. 296-98), which in turn follows Shaked and Sutton’s (1982) model of vertical
differentiation and price competition. Following Sutton (1991), we regard “perceived
quality” as a function of the stock of past advertising A (“brand capital”). No horizontal
differentiation is possible. The two firms both produce at the constant unit cost c. Under
conditions that guarantee that the market will support both the brand and the private label
product, we derive product prices (and thus margins), as well as profits for the two firms.
Firm 1 enters the game with a stock of “brand equity” A = A , which can be thought
of as the return to past expenditure on advertising. Firm 2 has no brand equity: A2 = 0.
Though all consumers prefer the branded product at the same price, willingness to pay for
the characteristics associated with the branding differs across individuals. Let this
heterogeneity, which we might associate either with taste or with income differences, be
parameterized by θ ~ U (θ0 ,θ1 ) , where θ0 ≥ 0 , and θ1 = θ0 + 1 . The utility of a type θ
consumer is U = θ (1 + A) − p if the consumer purchases one unit of the good with brand
equity A at price p, and 0 otherwise. The type θ consumer is thus indifferent between the
branded and the private label good when θ (1 + A ) − p1 = θ − p 2 .
Using a result from Tirole (1989), demands for the two firms as a function of the

5

prices p1 and p2 are then
D1 ( p1 , p 2 ) = θ1 −

p1 − p 2
p − p2
, and D2 ( p1 , p 2 ) = 1
− θ0
A
A

As A becomes large, the products become less and less substitutable, and the relative
demand less and less price-sensitive.
Nash equilibrium occurs when firm i maximizes ( pi − c)Di ( pi , p j ) with respect to
pj (i, j =1, 2). The prices, quantities demanded, and profits in the Nash equilibrium are:
p1 = c +

2θ1 − θ0
A
3

D1 = (2θ1 − θ0 ) / 3

p2 = c +

θ1 − 2θ0
A < p1
3

D2 = (θ1 − 2θ0 ) / 3

π1 = (2θ1 − θ0 ) 2 A / 9 π2 = (θ1 − 2θ0 ) 2 A / 9

Thus the qualitative results are:
• Firm 1, the nationally branded incumbent, charges a higher price than the “private
label” firm 2. However, both charge above marginal cost.
• The excess of price over marginal cost, and the profits of both the brand and the
private label producer, are increasing in the degree of heterogeneity in the population
and in firm 1’s stock of brand capital.4
• Both firms make some profit, although the national brand makes more.
b.

Adding the Retail Sector
The stylized model above illustrates the role of brand capital and heterogeneous tastes

for “perceived quality” in providing a market niche for private labels, and their effect on
markups, quantity sold, and profits. However, we must now add a specific role for
retailers, which are obviously central to our empirical analysis of the supermarket data.
Lal and Narasimhan (1996) construct a model along the lines of the above example, but
with two manufacturing firms, two retailers, and a composite outside good. Their model

3

We introduce retailers in the next subsection.
That the margin of the private label supplier is increasing in firm 1’s stock of brand equity reflects the
“principle of maximal differentiation,” which is not entirely robust (Tirole, 1989).
4

6

is intended to explain why under some conditions a manufacturer's advertising can
“squeeze”, i.e., lower the retail margin while simultaneously increasing the wholesale
margin, a point stressed previously by Steiner (1993).
Stores carry many products, and on any given purchase occasion a typical consumer
buys only a subset of the products. Retailers, Lal and Narasimhan (1996) hypothesize,
therefore tend to compete more aggressively based on the prices of a selected set of wellrecognized nationally branded items by advertising these prices to consumers. Since the
contribution to profit from any customer is the sum of revenue from advertised and
unadvertised items, the intensity of retail competition, as evident from the prices of these
items, increases with the amount the consumer will expend on the unadvertised items once
at the store. This aggressiveness therefore translates into lower retail margins on these
selected items since the retailers expect that consumers, once inside a store, will also buy
non-advertised products on which the retailers receive high margins. Manufacturers who,
via advertising, have established a stock of well-recognized products, are able to charge
high prices to retailers. The higher margin earned by retailers on their private label
products compared with national brands is an important feature of the data we examine.
If the retail level of the channel is very competitive, retail margins are not likely to be
much larger than handling costs. Many authors such as Levy, et al. (1998, 2001) suggest
that the retail grocery industry is indeed very competitive. Retail margins on branded
products are in fact very small for most product groups in our data set.
c.

Lower Bounds for Markups: Algebra5
The “ideal” measure of the markup ratio - that which measures the extent to which

quantity consumed falls short of the first best optimum - is the price paid by the consumer
relative to the full marginal cost of supplying an extra unit. Denote the marginal
p

production cost faced by the brand manufacturer as cb and the marginal cost the retailer
faces in stocking and selling the branded product – the “marginal handling
h

cost”– as cb .6 The “full” marginal cost of providing a unit of the branded product is
5

This section owes a major debt to our discussant, Julio Rotemberg.

6

Note that we do not make the assumption that

cbp and cbh

are constant unit costs. We do not need

7

thus:

cb = cb + cb .
(1)
Consequently, we define the true markup as
p

(2)

h

pbr
µ* ≡ p
,
cb + cbh

where p br denotes the retail price of the branded product. In this subsection, we show
how to bound this ideal measure in terms of quantities that we are able to observe directly
in the data on retail price and store margins.
In line with evidence presented in section III, we postulate that the marginal
production cost of the private label (denoted by g) is not less than that of the brand, i.e.
(3)

cbp ≤cgp .

Because the manufacturer of the private label will not normally sell at a wholesale price
less than its marginal production cost, we have:
(4)

cgp ≤ pgw

Combining (3) and (4), we have:
(5)

cbp ≤ pgw .

Thus the wholesale price of the private label is an upper bound on the marginal
manufacturing cost of the brand.
Likewise, the retailer’s margin on the branded product should at least cover the
marginal handling costs. Letting
(6)

mbr ≡ pbr − pbw ,

where p bw denotes the wholesale price of the branded product, we have:
(7)

cbh ≤mbr .
r

The degree to which mb overstates marginal handling costs depends on the ability of

this assumption in our empirical work, because we are using price data to make bounding arguments
rather than to arrive at point estimates of marginal costs. In particular, if there are fixed costs in
production and/or selling that must be covered, the wholesale price and the retail price will overestimate
marginal costs.

8

the brand manufacturer to extract, on the margin, the rents associated with its brand
r

equity. In the limit, the brand manufacturer extracts all of the rents, and mb equals the
retailer’s true marginal handling cost.7 However, since we are seeking lower bounds for
the “true” markup, the logic of our argument does not in any way depend on such an
assumption. Our bounds will of course be tighter if the marginal profit earned by the store
on brand name goods is small. This is normally the case in practice since, as we will see in
r

section V, for all but a few product categories the observed mb - which must be the sum
of true marginal handling cost and the store’s marginal profit - is itself small.
Adding (5) and (7), we see that
(8)

cb ≡ cbp + cbh ≤ p gw + mbr .

Defining a new ratio µˆ as
(9)

pbr
µˆ ≡ w
,
p g + mbr

pbr
and recalling the definition of the unobservable “true” markup as µ* ≡ p
from
cb + cbh
equation (2), the inequality in (8) implies that
(10)

µˆ ≤µ * .

Equation (10) is the result most central to our empirical analysis because it implies that µˆ
is a lower bound on the “true” or “ideal” markup. Moreover, it shows how to construct a
lower bound on the markup ratio using data directly available in the Dominick’s dataset.
We will refer to the ratio µˆ as our preferred lower bound markup because, as we show
immediately below, it is a tighter lower bound for µ * than is the ratio of the retail prices.

7

There exist some handling cost data in marketing studies that focus on direct product profitability issues.
While we have not yet obtained these cost data, they would allow us to see just how conservative our
assumptions about handling cost are. Because our primary focus in this paper is on constructing a lower
bound on the “ideal” markup, the main thrust of the paper would remain unchanged. See Chen, et al.
(1999) and Marsh Super Study Special Report (Progressive Grocer, December 1992, and January 1993)
for details. We thank Jim Hess for informing us about the existence of such data.

9

Relationship of µˆand µ * to Retail and Wholesale Price Ratios
It is interesting to compare the preferred markup measure µˆ to the retail price

pbr
pbw
ratio r and to the wholesale price ratio w - the former because retail prices are
pg
pg
available in a wide variety of datasets (whereas data on retailer’s margins are less
common), and the latter because it is a lower bound for the manufacturer’s markup over

pbw pbw
r
r
w
marginal production cost; i.e. w ≤ p . Let mg ≡ pg − pg . As section V shows, in
p g cb
the data it is almost always the case that:

mbr ≤mgr ,

(11)

i.e. the retailer earns less revenue net of the wholesale price from selling a unit of the
national brand than from selling a unit of the comparable private label. When (11) holds,
we can see, by combining (8) and (11), and using (5) and (7), that:
(12)

cb ≡ cbp + cbh ≤ cbp + mbr ≤ pgw + mgr = p gr .

The retail price of the private label is an upper bound for the full marginal cost of the
brand; it is, however, a less tight upper bound than the preferred marginal cost measure
that appears in the denominator of µˆ. Hence the markup measure based on retail prices,

µr ≡

p br , is a lower bound for the true markup µ * , and understates µ * to a greater
p gr

extent than does µˆ.
Finally, it is easy to see that the markup measure based on wholesale prices,

pbw
pbr
w
w
µ ≡ w , satisfies µ ≥ µˆ. Recall that µˆ ≡ w
. To go from µˆ to µ , we
r
pg
p g + mb
w

r

subtract mb from both the numerator and the dominator. Since markup ratios exceed
unity, the subtraction has a larger percentage effect on the denominator than the
numerator. It is not, however, possible to say that µ is unambiguously an upper bound

for µ * , because we don’t know the extent to which p g and mb exceed, respectively, the

true marginal production cost and marginal handling cost of the national brand.
In summary, we report five markup ratios:

pbr

b) µ ≡ r , the lower bound measure of the full markup based on retail prices,

The first three ratios, along with the “true” underlying markup ratio µ * ≡ p

satisfy the inequalities:

and

µ r ≤µˆ ≤µ * .
III. Branded and Private Label Products: Issues of Comparability

In section II, we established algebraic conditions under which the ratios we report can
be considered lower bounds on the true markup. The usefulness of our arguments
depends, however, on the maintained hypothesis that neither the marginal production cost

11

nor the marginal handling cost of the branded product exceeds that of the private label
version. The appropriateness of this assumption is an empirical question whose answer
may differ across product categories. In this section we consider three potential
objections to the approach in this paper:

a) Private label goods are inferior products produced at lower cost using cheap, low
quality inputs (the “physical quality” objection).
b) Differences in production technique, scale, and factor prices make variable costs in the
manufacturing process non-comparable even when the final outputs are comparable
(the “production method” objection).
c) Even if the private label product is physically comparable to the nationally branded
version, the activities of advertising and otherwise promoting the national brand (and
perhaps also expenditures on research and development) may create additional
marginal costs for national brands (the “marketing cost” objection).

All three of these objections concern the comparability of the national brand and the store
brand versions, and all potentially call into question the supposition that marginal
production and marketing costs for the private label product are at least as great as those
for their branded counterparts. In the three subsections that we follow, we take up these
objections in turn.

a.

Physical Quality
This subsection has two purposes. First, it presents evidence that private label

products are not in general of lower physical quality than the corresponding national
brands. For the purposes of this paper, this is of interest not in and of itself, but because a
finding of low quality in tests by quality control managers and consumer organizations
might indicate the use of lower quality inputs, and hence lower marginal cost.
Second, though private label products are not in general physically inferior, there is
some evidence of variation in the relative quality of brands and private labels across
product categories. Thus we discuss in this section our efforts to weed out categories in

12

which there are in fact problems of comparability that make it difficult to construct
matching pairs of physically identical products.
Branded and private label versions of a product cannot be economically identical, as
that would violate the law of one price. Objection a) concerns possible differences in the
quality of the physical product and not differences in “perceived quality “ associated with
sunk advertising costs, as discussed by Sutton (1991). Further, because the relevant
concern is with differences in marginal costs, it is in fact not in fact necessary that the
private label product be of equal physical quality in all respects. Superior designs or
propriety formulas that do not affect marginal cost do not pose a problem.8 We focus on
“quality” to the extent that low quality of the private label product is suggestive of the use
of lower cost inputs. We identify product categories in which this appears to be an issue,
and we avoid these in the empirical work reported in sections IV and V.9
Hoch and Banerji (1993), noting the absence of secondary data source on private
label quality comprehensive enough to cover all the SAMI product categories,10
undertook a survey of quality assurance managers at the fifty largest supermarket chains
and grocery wholesalers in the United States (according to Thomas Food Industry
Register). These experts typically have graduate education in food science and have wide
experience testing numerous product categories. For each of the original SAMI
categories the managers were asked: “How does the quality of the best private label
supplier compare to the leading national brands in the product category?” The respondents
gave a rating on a five point scale: a “1” suggests that private labels are much worse in
quality than the national brands while a “5” suggests that the private label quality is fully
comparable to that of the national brand.11 In Exhibit I, we report the means of these

8

See the section below on soft drinks.

9

It turns out that the only product category with a questionable qualitative comparability is bathroom
tissues.
10
For example, Consumer Reports does not have quality ratings for all the products included in our data
set.
11
Hoch and Banerji contacted each of these managers by telephone to solicit their participation, and
followed up with a questionnaire. Thirty-two people (64%) returned the survey, resulting in twenty-five
usable sets of responses (50%). The experts received a one-page set of instructions explaining what is
meant by each question and how to use the scales. They were instructed to evaluate “objective” quality
rather than quality as perceived by customers.

Hoch and Banerji’s (1993, p. 62) own evaluation of the evidence is that “the over
riding sentiment of these experts was that quality of the best private label was quite close
to that of the national brands.” This is consistent with industry observers (e.g. Quelch and
Harding, 1996; Fitzell, 1998) who suggest that while over the long haul private label
products have not consistently exhibited the uniformly high quality standards as national
brands, in recent years private label products have significantly improved in quality and
packaging enhancements, making them comparable to the national brands. The quality
comparability of private label products in these categories is further reinforced by a survey
that asks consumers about their perceptions of the quality premium that national brands
offer relative to private labels (Sethuraman and Cole, 1997). This study finds consumers
are willing to pay a price premium for national brands even though they are aware that the
price premiums do not reflect corresponding quality differences.

14

It is important to stress that the label “Dominick’s Finer Foods” is in itself a kind of
branding which differentiates the supermarket chain’s products from true generics. The
very particular sort of branding practiced by Dominick’s and other supermarket chains,
makes no attempt to provide the utility-yielding associations that is the object of much
national advertising. It may, however, do a very good job of assuring physical quality.
According to Fitzell (1998), private label owners do not compromise on quality because
they cannot really afford to put a store name or their own brand name on a product that
may be considered inferior. Use of a name such as Dominick’s serves a bonding function:
if one good (or the services of one store) proves to be inferior or unpalatable, there is a
spillover on the credibility of all goods and all stores carrying that label.
Finally, we can use Hoch and Banerji’s private label quality ratings along with other
information to identify categories where quality differences are more likely so that we can
learn whether or not the quality differences are likely to indicate lower variable costs for
the private label version. To that end we undertook further study of the two product
categories that were ranked lowest by Hoch and Banerji’s survey and that are also
included in the Dominick’s data: bathroom tissue and soft drinks.

Bathroom Tissue
This was one of the lowest rated categories in terms of quality comparability. Thus
the higher markups may, in this category, represent true input quality differences and
therefore differences in marginal costs. There exists a recent Consumer Reports article on
bathroom tissue as well as recent academic paper by Hausman (1999) on the category.
Both of these, as well as a survey of consumer perceptions by Sethuraman and Cole
(1997), reinforced the belief that this category does indeed have significant quality
variation. The Consumer Reports article reported studies of many products that ranged
broadly from Ultra Plush Charmin to low quality private labels products and Scott tissue.
Hausman (1999) echoes the claim that some brands are of low quality while others are of
high quality. Consistent with this, Sethuraman and Cole (1997) find that consumers rate
bathroom tissue as one of the two product categories for which the quality gap as
perceived by consumers is highest. Further, Hausman (1999) suggests that this is due to

15

real differences in input quality in the pulp used to make the paper, which is likely to lead
to higher costs for higher quality branded manufacturers in this category. We thought this
might allow us to compare the private label Scott, but Scott turns out to have many more
sheets per role than the private label, making it possible that Scott faces higher costs
because of the additional sheets, even if the input costs are the same or lower. In the end
this additional information led us to drop the bathroom tissue category from this paper
(though the price ratios in this category averaged above 2.0). We were not able to find
national brand/private label pairs that were of comparable quality and for which we were
confident that the private label product was not cheaper to produce on the margin.

Soft Drinks
According to our quality experts, soft drinks are one of the least comparable in terms
of quality based on quality control manger’s perceptions. To the degree that the quality
differences relate to cost savings for the private label, this would inflate our markup
estimates. Yet to the degree that the differences in quality are in terms of taste or other
inputs into the syrup, they are unlike to lead to substantial differences in variable costs.
We include soft drinks in this paper because knowledge of the nature of soft drink
production and distribution suggests that the sources of quality differences were not likely
to be related to the marginal costs faced by soft drink manufacturers. In this category the
majority of the costs are bottling and distribution. The cost of the syrup is only a very
small portion of the cost of producing soft drinks.

b.

Production Methods, Scale, Factor Prices, and Other Cost Differences
Even if the final products are physically identical, marginal manufacturing costs may

differ because of differences in production technology, scale, or the prices paid for labor
and/or materials. We report here some observations concerning differences between
national brand manufacturers and manufacturing firms that supply output for sale under
private labels – referred to in the industry as “co-packers.”
We interviewed a number of industry experts on private labels. Their general sense
was that for products of equal quality, the variable costs of producing private labels were

16

likely to be at least as high, and probably higher, than the corresponding costs for national
brands. The general tenor of the responses we received is captured by the following
comment from the vice president of a major private label food broker:
“National brands should be able to physically produce at a lower cost … they are able to negotiate
lower prices on components and vertically integrate to carry out processes themselves rather than
having to buy at higher marginal cost… ”

Below we describe in more detail the nature of manufacturing by co-packers, and its
implications for marginal costs.

Types of Private Label Manufacturers
As spelled out on the web page of the Private Labels Manufacturers Association,
private label manufactures fall into four categories. They are:

1) Large national brand manufacturers that utilize excess plant capacity to supply store
brands.
2) Small, quality manufacturers who specialize in particular product lines and concentrate
on producing store brands almost exclusively. Often, these companies are owned by
corporations that also produce national brands.
3) Major retailers and wholesalers that own their own manufacturing facilities and provide
store brand products for themselves.
4) Regional brand manufacturers that produce private label products for specific markets.

In general, private label manufacturers are smaller, more regional and more
fragmented than their national brand counterparts. Indeed, according to Fitzell (1998), as
the private label manufacturing evolved in the US, the trend has been more toward smaller
manufacturers/processors. As a result, the national brand business, with its high costs of
product development and marketing, was left to the larger manufacturers. For example,
some of the producers for TOPCO (which handles distribution for what is perhaps the
largest private label program in the country) are large enough to produce and market
products successfully under their own brands. In many cases, however, it turns out that
they are small or medium sized producers that lack the necessary financial strength or

17

organizational structure to market their own brand products effectively when facing strong
national competitors (Fitzell, 1998).
We interviewed at some length a production manager at a large branded manufacturer
in the consumer packaged goods industry. Though he preferred to remain anonymous, he
expressed the belief that everything he shared with us is common knowledge in the
industry.
This manager noted that at one time or another, most co-packers produce for branded
manufacturers. To that end, private label manufacturers would have access to the same
equipment and techniques as manufacturers of the brand because they must meet the
quality standards of the national brand manufacturers for which they produce. Further, he
said, branded manufacturers supply some of the equipment for their co-packers. These
observations are also found in the FTC complaint against the proposed merger of General
Mills with Ralcorp, which was at the time (1997) both the fifth largest supplier of ready to
eat breakfast cereal for sale under a national brand name, and the largest producer of
private label cereals.
Our interviewee described three major considerations determining relative production
cost that he called “throughput,” “crewing,” and wage rates. “Throughput” appears to
be industry terminology for number of units produced per hour, while “crewing”
apparently refers to labor intensity. It is not clear that these are entirely separate
considerations from the point of view of microeconomic theory, but we will try to stick as
closely as possible to the terminology used by the interviewee.
The manager contended that throughput for branded manufacturers is significantly
higher than for co-packers, while crewing is indicative of greater automation and lower
labor intensity in production of branded products. First and foremost, private label
manufactures are smaller in scale. Second, private label manufacturers by the nature of
their business need to be more flexible with respect to the quantities they produce. They
often supply multiple private labels, and uncertain demand calls for a degree of flexibility
that limits their ability to benefit from large-scale production runs and the economies of
scale of the brand manufacturer. This leads to lower line speeds and lower “throughput”
for private label manufacturers.

18

As to “crewing,” branded product factories have greater automation than private label
factories, an observation that the manager regarded as central to his belief that brand
manufacturers produce at a lower variable cost. Relative to the private label
manufacturers, branded firms have fewer employees and more equipment per unit of
output. Wage rates, on the other hand, work in the opposite direction: here, brand
manufacturers are at a cost disadvantage. They are more likely to use union workers,
which raises cost, in terms of wages and benefits. This is closely related to the “large firm
effect” on wages in the academic literature (Brown and Medoff, 1989). The manager’s
sense was that the throughput advantage roughly offset the wage disadvantage for an
equal crew size. But the branded manufacturer had a sufficiently lower labor intensity – a
“crewing” advantage - that more than offset the higher wages.
The value of size for national brands has been noted in academic studies as well. For
example, Schmalensee (1978) has shown that national brands benefit from the substantial
economies of scale in production and advertising that accrue through national distribution
in the cereal category. Likewise, Brown and Medoff (1990) have shown that larger
buyers receive substantial quantity discounts on their purchases, although this advantage is
again offset to a greater or lesser extent by higher wage costs.
In sum, industry experts as well as academic articles regard the preponderance of the
evidence as indicating that marginal costs for private label products are at least as high—
and in many cases higher— than marginal costs for the national brands with which they are
paired. This conclusion supports our use of wholesale prices of private label goods as
upper bounds for the marginal manufacturing cost of the corresponding brand name
products.
c.

The Marketing Cost Issue
A third potential difference between national brands and private labels concerns costs

of product introduction and marketing. Industry sources indicate that in general private
label manufacturers do far less in terms of R&D, advertising, trade promotion and
consumer promotion than national brands. For example, Fitzell (1998) states that national
brand businesses have high costs of product development and marketing.

19

This leaves us with the remaining question of how large these costs are and whether
they are fixed or variable costs in nature. We argue that R&D is a sunk cost, and that
national advertising expenditure constitutes predominantly a fixed cost, much but not all of
which can be regarded as sunk in the sense of Sutton (1991). This leaves trade promotion
spending and consumer promotion spending as possible variable cost differences we must
consider. Notice that the largest effect of both trade promotions and consumer promotions
is the reduced price the manufacturer receives from the promotions. Thus they aren’t
marginal cost differences, but adjustments to the prices the manufacturer receives that we
must consider. There are additional costs of implementing the promotional programs that
we should also consider.

Research & Development
R&D is one area where private labels and national brands differ substantially. For
example, according to Fitzell (1982), research and development expenditures of private
label manufacturers usually are substantially lower than the expenditures of the national
brand manufacturers. The managers of national brands see these kinds of expenditures as
critical to maintaining their brand equity. Clearly R&D spending for new product
development is not marginal for products being sold in grocery chains. According to
Monroe (1990), as well as many other authors, research and development costs do not
vary with the (sales) activity and are not easily traceable to a product or segment, and
therefore should be treated as fixed from our perspectives.

Advertising
Advertising spending is another major difference between national brands and private
labels. National brands invest large amounts of money in advertising. For example, in the
Survey of Leading National Advertisers in Advertising Age magazine (2000), it is reported
that advertising spending for major brands is substantial. Further, many brands have been
doing this for many years. Indeed, according to Quelch and Harding (1996), it took over
decades of advertising by the strongest national brands to build their consumer equities.
As another example, it seems that restrictions on television advertising may help explain

20

the strength of private labels in Europe relative to the U.S. because regulated television
markets mean that cumulative advertising for brand names does not approach the U.S.
levels" (Quelch and Harding, 1996).
This has not been true for most private labels because their owners could not afford
the expense of building their own brand equity by adopting multi-million dollar advertising
campaigns (Fitzell, 1998). In the case of the specific retailer we are studying, we know
that it did not invest anywhere near the amounts spent by the national brand manufacturers
of comparable products, even on a per-unit sold or sales basis, on advertising to build
brands.
The question then is whether it is more reasonable to treat advertising expenditures by
manufacturers as a fixed cost or variable cost. If we suppose for a moment that the
branded variant is heavily advertised while the private label version is not, the average cost
of a unit sold (which includes costs incurred by the "marketing department" in addition to
those of the "production department") would be higher for the branded product. The
question, put differently, then becomes whether advertising should be seen as a marginal
cost as opposed to a fixed or sunk cost.
The best evidence we could find on this question in the literature is from the Cox
Annual Survey of Promotional Practices (1996). It surveys consumers, packaged goods
manufacturers and grocery retailers on issues of promotion practice and usage. The
particular survey was conducted in 1995 and its participants included 34% larger firms
(i.e., those with annual sales of $1 billion or more) and 66% smaller firms (i.e., those with
annual sales of less than $1 billion).
When asked about the share of national advertising programs designed to support and
build brand equity, consumer and trade promotions, etc., the survey participants state that
they view their advertising expenses as mostly aimed at building brand equity, which is
more of a fixed or long run cost. According to the survey results, the packaged goods
manufacturers believe that at least 66% of their advertising spending is meant to build
their brand equity only. Of the remaining 34%, 14% of their advertising spending is
devoted to both brand equity and consumer promotions, 7% to both brand equity and
trade promotions, and the remaining 13% to brand equity, trade and consumer

21

promotions. It follows that up to 80% of advertising is related to brand equity. Morton
and Zettelmeyer (2000) also emphasize the difference in fixed costs between national and
store brands. The advertising required to support national brands, they argue, implies that
national brand manufacturers have substantially higher average costs than their marginal
costs of production. This is consistent with the idea that advertising by national brands
may be viewed as a fixed, rather than variable, cost.

Trade Promotions
Manufacturers also invest heavily in trade promotions. In the Cox survey they report
some industry averages on how firms in the grocery industry allocate their promotional
dollars. It looks to be about 50% trade promotions, 25% national advertising and 25%
consumer promotions. So trade promotions are the largest component of manufacturer
spending. Private label manufacturers do not undertake nearly as much trade spending, so
this is another major difference between national brands and private labels.
Fortunately the Dominick’s data already incorporates some of the trade spending in
its wholesale prices, so we have already taken part of manufacturer’s trade promotion
spending into account in our measurement of national brand markups. It is likely that there
are trade promotions that are not captured by the wholesale prices in our data. These are
most likely lumpy payments such as slotting allowances, cooperative advertising
allowances, and various case-discounts and spiffs the manufacturer gives to the retailer.
To the degree that they are lumpy, and not incorporated into the wholesale price that
retailers are using in their pricing decisions, however, it is not clear that these expenses are
truly variable. So these unreported trade expenditures may not be as relevant as the trade
promotions incorporated into the data we use in this paper. But to the degree that the
unreported trade spending is variable, and substantial, our measure of markups will be
overstated.

Consumer Promotions
This is also a major difference between national brands and private labels. Private

22

labels tend to not coupon or promote to consumers.12 While branded manufacturers spend,
on average, 25% of their promotional expenses on consumer promotions. That is about on
par with the amount spent on national advertising.
These activities are likely to be either reductions in the price manufacturers receive
(as with redeemed coupons) or variable expenses to run the promotion. Although scanner
data sets often include some measures of usage of manufacturers’coupons, that is not true
in this data set. To give the reader some sense of how important these may be by category,
we report the percentage of sales made using a coupon for all product categories in our
paper in Exhibit 2.

In summary, we believe there is enough evidence to suggest that using private label
product prices to infer national brand costs is a reasonable assumption in this industry.
There is reason to believe, therefore, that this measure of markup can be appropriate for at
least some categories and products in this industry. Further, since the private label will
have some markup, and the nationally branded products have advantages on size and scale
in production, packaging and negotiation on input prices, we believe that private label
12

Slade (1998) offers some possible reasons for the lack of promotional activity for private label products.

23

product prices provide a conservative measure of these costs.

IV. Data

We use scanner data from Dominick’s Finer Food (DFF), which is one of the largest
retail supermarket chains in the larger Chicago metropolitan area, operating 94 stores with
a market share of about 25 percent. Large multi-store U.S. Supermarket chains of this
type made up about $310,146,666,000 in total annual sales in 1992, which was 86.3% of
total retail grocery sales (Supermarket Business, 1993). In 1999 the retail grocery sales
has reached $435 billion (Chevalier, Kashyap, and Rossi, 2000). Thus the chain we study
is a representative of a major class of the retail grocery trade. Moreover, Dominick’s type
multi-store supermarket chains’sales constitute about 14 percent of the total retail sales of
about $2,250 billion in the US. Since retail sales account for about 9.3 percent of the
GDP, our data set is a representative of as much as 1.28 percent of the GDP, which seems
substantial. Thus the market we are studying has a quantitative economic significance as
well.
The original Dominick’s data consist of up to 400 weekly observations of actual
transaction prices in 29 different categories, covering the period from September 14, 1989
to May 8, 1997. The length of individual product price time series, however, varies
depending on when the data collection for the specific category began and ended.13 The
data come from the chain’s scanner database which contains actual retail transaction prices
of the products along with the profit margin the supermarket makes on each one of them.
From the information on retail prices and the profit margin, we have constructed the
weekly time series of wholesale prices.
The retail prices are the actual transaction prices: the price customers paid at the cash
register each week. If the item was on sale, then the price data we have reflect the sale
price. Although the retail prices are set on a chain-wide basis at the corporate
headquarters of Dominick’s, there may still be some price variation across the stores

13

As Chevalier, et al. (2000) indicate, Dominick’s UPC-level database does not include all products the
chain sells. The database we use represents approximately 30 percent of Dominick’s revenues.

24

depending on the competitive market structure in and around the location of the stores
(Levy, et al., 1998). According to Chevalier, et al. (2000), Dominick’s maintains three
such price zones. Thus, for example, if a particular store of the chain is located in the
vicinity of a Cub Food store, then the store may be designated a “Cub-fighter” and as
such, it may pursue a more aggressive pricing policy in comparison to the stores located in
other zones. In the analysis described below we have used all the data available from all
stores by properly aggregating them across the stores.14
The wholesale prices, which measure the direct cost to the retailer, are computed by
combining the retail price data with the information provided by the retailer on their
weekly gross margins for each product and using the relation, wholesale price = (1 – gross
margin %) multiplied by the retail price. The wholesale prices DFF uses for computing
their gross margin series are constructed by the retailer as a weighted average of the
amount the retailer paid for all its inventory. For example, a profit margin of 25.3 means
that DFF makes 25.3 cents on the dollar for each item sold which yields a cost of good
sold of 74.7 cents. If the retailer bought its current stock of a Kellog’s Corn Flakes, 18oz,
in two transactions, then its wholesale price is computed as the average of these two
transaction prices (no FIFO or LIFO accounting rules are used in these computations).15
For the purpose of this study, we went through the entire DFF’s data set and
identified pairs of national brand and private label products. Of the approximately 350
pairs we were able to locate in the 29 product categories, we have eliminated a portion of

14

Aggregation issues are discussed in detail below in this section. We should note that our retail prices
reflect any retailer’s coupons or discounts, but, as mentioned above, do not include manufacturer coupons.
15
Thus, the wholesale costs in the data do not correspond exactly to the replacement cost or the last
transaction price. Instead we have the average acquisition cost (ACC) of the items in inventory. So the
supermarket chain sets retail prices for the next week and also determines AAC at the end of each week, t,
according to the formula
AAC(t+1) = (Inventory bought in t) Price paid(t) + (Inventory, end of t-l-sales(t)) AAC(t).
There are two main sources of discrepancy between replacement cost and AAC. The first is the familiar
one of sluggish adjustment. A wholesale price cut today only gradually works itself into AAC as old,
higher priced inventory is sold off. The second arises from the occasional practice of manufacturers to
inform the buyer in advance of an impending temporary price reduction. This permits the buyer to
completely deplete inventory and then "overstock" at the lower price. In this case AAC declines
precipitously to the lower price and stays there until the large inventory acquired at that price runs off.
Thus, the accounting cost shows the low price for some time after the replacement cost has gone back up.

25

them because of substantial size differences. For example, if say in cereals category we
compare Kellog’s Corn Flakes to DFF’s Corn Flakes, but the national brand comes in
32oz box (which is a family size) while DFF’s product comes in 18oz box, then the two
products are not really comparable as they are targeted to two different kinds of
customers, and computing prices per oz would not necessarily eliminate this fundamental
problem. Other pairs were eliminated because many non-private label brands did not
really qualify as national brand products as these products are marketed only regionally
(and some even locally only) or they did not have substantial market share. Still other pairs
were eliminated because of our uncertainty about equality of their quality. Finally, we have
imposed a minimum on the length of the weekly time series for them to be informative.
Thus, the results we report in this paper are for national brand-private label product
pairs, such that (1) the national brand product is clearly marketed nationally, (2) the
national brand product is widely recognized, (3) the national brand product has a nontrivial market share, (4) the national brand-private label product pair is comparable in size,
quality, and packaging, and (5) the price time series for the product pairs are available for
at least 24-week period for each of the three price zones.
The product pairs that pass these criteria represent 19 categories, which include
Analgesics, Bottled Juices, Cereals, Cheeses, Cookies, Crackers, Canned Soups, Dish
Detergent, Frozen Entrees, Frozen Juices, Fabric Softeners, Grooming Products, Laundry
Detergent, Oatmeal, Snack Crackers, Toothbrush, Tooth Pastes, Soft Drinks, and Canned
Tuna. In the case of the Soft Drinks category, it should be noted that most of the
nationally branded products included in this category are handled by their manufacturers
through various Direct Store Delivery arrangements.16 Thus, the “handling costs” of these
nationally branded products are incurred by their manufacturers.17 Therefore, to get a
16

Most big retail supermarket stores use some kind of dedicated warehouse channel distribution system
for their product replenishment. However, for number of reasons, the retailers often find it preferable to
obtain some products directly from the suppliers/manufacturers who deliver them directly to the store,
rather than via their normal warehouse channel. The products handled through such Direct Store Delivery
mechanisms usually are high-volume, fast-moving, and/or perishable products. See Levy, et al. (1998) for
further details on Direct Store Delivery arrangements at multi-product retail settings.
17
In the remaining ten categories, which include Bath Soap, Beer, Cigarettes, Front-End-Candies, Frozen
Dinners, Paper Towels, Refrigerated Juices, Shampoos, Soaps, and Bathroom Tissues, we were unable to
find comparable national brand-private label pairs. I.e., in these categories we were unable to find any
national brand-private label product pair that met all five criteria listed above.

26

markup ratio, in this case, we would take the ratio of the retail price of the nationally
branded product over our estimate of the marginal cost of the branded product, calculated
as the sum of the wholesale price of the private label product and our estimate of the
retailer handling cost. We, however, choose to treat the Soft Drink products and the rest
of the products in an identical fashion by using the same formula for measuring the
markup ratio. Therefore, by including in the denominator of the markup ratio the retailer’s
margin on the nationally branded product, we are overestimating the retailer’s handling
cost by counting the retailer’s profit as part of the marginal cost. The resulting markup
measure for the soft drink products will, therefore, be even more conservative than for the
rest of the categories.
To compute the average markup figures for each category, which we report in Tables
1–4, we had to compress the data by three different weighted-averaging procedures. First,
we have computed weighted-average of all weekly price series across all the chain's stores
to get a single weekly wholesale and retail price series for each of the national brand and
private label products chosen for the analysis. The purpose of the weighing procedure we
have implemented is to ensure that the price series coming from the stores that sell
proportionally more than others, receive higher weight. This averaging was done by
weighing the national brand and private label price series from each store according to the
store's sales share in the total DFF's sale where the sales are measured by the weekly sales
figures of the specific national brand and private label products, respectively. Since the
scanner database does not include information on the quantities purchased at the
wholesale level, we used the retail sales figures as its proxy. This procedure likely
introduces a noise in the generated series because the retail sales are more spread over
time in comparison to wholesale purchases, which occur with lower frequency. The noise,
however, will mostly affect the weekly volatility properties of the price series, but the
average values are unlikely to be affected from this procedure in a significant way.
Next, we computed the weighted average weekly values of the above across-store
weighted averaged series by taking each price series for the sample period it was available
and computing its weekly average value by weighing each weekly observation according

27

to the share of that week’s quantity sold in the total quantity sold over the entire sample
period. As before, the purpose of this weighing is to give higher weight to observations
(i.e., weeks) that represent higher sales volume measured in terms of products’quantity
(such as oz’s). In each case the prices of national brand products were weighed using the
sales volume of that specific national brand product while the price series of the private
label products were correspondingly weighed by sales volume of the private label
products. These series then were used to compute various markup measures reported in
Tables 5–8 and A1–A15.
It should be noted that an alternative way of computing these weekly average markup
values for each national brand-private label product pair is to first compute weekly markup
series for the entire sample period covered by each product pair and then compute their
weekly weighted average using the procedure outlined above. The calculations performed
using this procedure have yielded similar quantitative results in terms of the average
markup figures. The procedure we use, however, has the advantage that by first
computing the markup ratios and then averaging them over time (instead of first averaging
them over time and then computing the markup ratios) makes it possible to explore the
time series variability in each individual markup series and perhaps also to provide some
measure of over time variability associated with the markup.
Finally, we have taken the above-calculated average markup figures for each product
pair and computed the average markup for each of the 19 product categories included in
our sample. As before, these category averages were also calculated as weighted averages.
However, unlike the previous steps, here the weighing was done according to the share of
the dollar value of the sales for each product pair in the dollar value of the total sales in
the category. For example, if in the analgesics category we have 24 national brand-private
label product pairs, to compute the category average markup, we took the markup figures
for the 24 product pairs (listed in Table 6) and computed their weighted average, where
the weights are the ratios of the total dollar sales of the pair to the total dollar sales in the
category. The weights here use dollar sales rather than unit sales in order to avoid the
problem of “adding apples to oranges.” The resulting category averages figures are
reported in Tables 1–4.

28

Along with the average markup ratio measures we also report their inter-quartile
ranges. The inter-quartile range figures reported for individual product pairs within each
category (Tables 5-8 and A1-A15) are computed by using the weekly time series of the
corresponding markup ratios and determining the range in which 50 percent of these
weekly markups fall for each product pair. The inter-quartile range figures reported for
category averages (Tables 1–4) are computed by considering the average weekly markups
for each product pair and determining the range in which 50 percent of them fall for each
category.18
In the individual category tables (Tables 5–8 and A1-A15), we identify each national
brand-private label product pair by the name of the branded products because the private
label equivalents of the nationally branded products listed in these tables are always the
Dominick’s store brand products. Note also that in these tables, some brand names appear
more than once. This is because they refer to different sizes. For example, in the analgesics
category reported in Table 5, Advil (with the corresponding private label product) is listed
three times because it comes in three different sizes (“counts”), 10, 50, and 100.

V. Empirical Findings

In this section we report computations of the five markup ratios derived in section IIc above. Our primary objective is to offer the tightest possible lower bound on µ * , the
“ideal” full markup ratio for the nationally branded product. Our second goal is to provide
a sense of the quantitative relationships between the five markup ratios that we derived in
II-c. These ratios offer insight into the anatomy of µˆ ; and because they have
interpretations as markups at specific stages of the production and distribution processes,
they are of interest in their own right.

18

Although not reported to save space, we have also computed two additional measures of variation of
markup ratios over time. First, we have estimated the standard deviation of the markup ratio for each
product pair. Second, we have estimated the weighted standard deviation of the markup ratio for each

[

product pair. The latter differs from the former in that it assigns variable weights to the x(i) − x

[

]2

terms unlike the common procedure, which assigns the same weight, 1/n or 1/(n-1), to each x(i) − x
term.

]2
29

In section V-a, we report the results for category averages. We begin with the
“bottom line,” the “preferred” measure µˆ , our tightest lower bound on µ * . We then
move on to µ w , the ratio of the wholesale prices, which usually exceeds µˆ , and is a lower
bound on the manufacturer’s markup. Next, we discuss µb and µ g , the retailer’s
markups over wholesale price for branded and private label products, respectively. These
provide the link from µ w to the more commonly observed markup ratio computed using
retail prices, µ , which is the last of the five ratios that we report. Finally, we close
r

section V-a with the presentation of a graph that shows µˆ flanked by µ w and µ , and thus
r

offers an empirical counterpart to the bounding inequalities derived in section II-c.
In section V-b we focus in more detail on selected product categories. The category
of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, in particular, has been the object of several studies in the
econometric literature, and we are able to compare our results with available structural
estimates. Finally, examining closely several product pairs in representative categories, we
obtain some insight into within-category variation of the markups.

V-a. Results for Category Averages
The “Preferred” Lower Bound Markup Measure µˆ
In Table 1 and Figure 1 we report our “preferred” lower bound markup measure
labeled µˆ in II-c. The table shows that in four product categories - toothbrushes, soft
drinks, crackers, and grooming products - the mean lower bound markup ratio µˆ is on
the order of 2.0 or higher. In three categories - analgesics, canned soups, and fabric
softeners – µˆ averages between 1.60 and 2.00, while in six categories - oatmeal, cookies,
snack crackers, tooth paste, cereals, and dish detergent – mean µˆ falls approximately in
the range 1.40–1.60. For the remaining six categories - bottled juice, cheese, frozen juice,
laundry detergents, frozen entrees, and canned tuna - the average lower bound markup
ratio is less than 1.40. The categories with smallest µˆ are canned tuna (1.16), frozen
entrees (1.21), and laundry detergents (1.22).

30

Table 1 and Figure 1 provide a good deal of evidence that nationally branded
products are sold at a substantial markup. In more than half of the categories, the average
lower bound on the markup ratio is at least 1.40. Since the measure we report here is
conservative, true markup ratios are likely to be even higher.

Manufacturer’s Markup: Lower Bound Based on Wholesale Prices
w
As discussed in sections II and III, µ - the ratio of the wholesale prices - provides a

lower bound for the brand manufacturer’s markup. In Table 2 we present average µ w by
category. A comparison of the figures in Tables 1 and 2 indicates that with the exception
of the toothbrush and crackers categories, the two markup ratios µ w and µˆ , are of
similar magnitude. For ten categories -fabric softeners, oatmeal, toothpaste, cereal, dish
detergent, bottled juice, cheese, laundry detergent, frozen entrees, and canned tuna - the
difference between the two measures is less than 0.1. For seven categories - soft drinks,
grooming products, analgesics, canned soups, cookies, snacks crackers and frozen juicethe difference between the two measures is between 0.10 and 0.20. Nationally branded
products that have a large manufacturer’s markup according to Table 2, also have large
full markups according to Table 1. This should not be surprising, as we obtained µˆ from

µ w by adding mbr - the retailer’s margin on the brand - to both the numerator and the
denominator of µ w , and as we show immediately below, with a few exceptions, the retail
margins on branded products are quite small.19
As we move down the list to categories with lower markup ratios, the gap between the
two markup measures becomes particularly small, a direct result of the algebraic
relationship between µˆ and µ w . Thus, although the conservative treatment of the
retailer’s handling cost embodied in µˆ is theoretically appealing, its actual quantitative
significance is not overwhelming.

19

This conclusion also holds, for the most part, within individual categories, as Tables 5–8 and A1–A15
indicate.

31

Retailer’s Markups on Private Labels and National Brands
In Table 3 and Figure 3 we report the retailer’s markup – the ratio of retail price to
wholesale price - for the private label ( µ g ), and nationally branded products (µb), by
category. According to Table 3, for all but three products, the retailer’s markup ratios for
the nationally branded products are all less than 1.20. The exceptions are canned soups
(1.46), toothbrushes (1.37), and frozen juice (1.31). Moreover, the retailer’s markups on
nationally branded product are small both in comparison to µˆ and µ w (see Figure 4),
and in comparison to retailer’s markup on the private label. Specifically, in all but one
category (frozen entrees), retail markups are higher for private labels than for national
brands. Second, in all but one category (frozen juice), the retail markups for nationally
branded products are lower than the manufacturers’markups.
According to the figures in Table 3, the retailer’s markup ratios for nationally branded
products range from 1.03 for laundry detergent to 1.46 for canned soups. For more than
one third of categories - grooming products, analgesics, fabric softeners, toothpaste,
cereal, dish detergents, and laundry detergents – the average retailer’s markup ratio on the
brand is less than 1.10.
In contrast, the retailer’s markup ratios for private label products are substantially
higher. Omitting the puzzling case of the toothbrush category (with a measured retailer’s
markup ratio of 4.87), the average retailer’s markup on the private label version ranges
from 1.07 for laundry detergents to 1.76 for soft drinks. Only in the categories of laundry
detergents, dish detergents, cereals, and frozen entrees are retailer’s private label markup
ratios less than 1.20.
Thus we find clear evidence that retailers’markups are higher for private labels than
national brands. This fact is well known in the trade. For example, according to Morton
and Zettelmeyer (2000), retailers “… achieve higher price-cost margins [on private label
products] than those earned with national brands. Industry observers, the popular press
and academic work all indicate that this effect can be quite large.” According to Hoch and
Banerji (1993) “Industry sources suggest that retailer gross margins on private labels are

32

20% to 30% higher than on national brands.” 20

Lower Bound Measure of the Full Markup Based on Retail Prices
Previous authors, such as Scherer (1980), Carlton and Perloff (1994), and Nevo,
(2001), have focused on the ratio of retail prices µ . Though we have made the case that
r

)
r
µ is a better measure than µ of the markup paid by consumers over full marginal cost, it
is useful to report µ as well, both for comparison with these previous studies, and
r

because retail prices are becoming increasingly available with the development of new
technologies in computers, electronic scanners, etc.
Table 4 shows the markup ratios for national brands based on the retail prices of
nationally branded products and private labels, µ . The markup ratios range from a high
r

of 2.33 for toothbrushes to a low of 1.14 for canned tuna. The majority of the markups are
below 1.4, the only exceptions being crackers (2.00), grooming products (1.75),
analgesics (1.63), fabric softeners (1.52), and cookies (1.49), as well as the
aforementioned toothbrushes (2.33). This is in general true within the individual categories
as well, again with the exception of the above categories. Recall that µ underestimates
r

)
r
the full markup to a greater extent than does µ , because µ treats the handling cost
more conservatively by using as its proxy the retailer’s margin on the private label
product.

V-b.

Detailed Results for Some Selected Categories and Products

In Tables 5–8, we report detailed tabulations of all five markup ratios derived in
section II-c, for each national brand/private label pair in the toothbrushes, analgesics,
cereal, and crackers categories, respectively. In Tables A1-A15 of the appendix, we report
20

See also Slade (1998). This divergence between retailer’s margins on branded and private label
products is associated with differences between the profitability of American and European supermarkets.
“In European supermarkets, higher private-label sales result in higher average pretax profits. U.S.
supermarkets average only 15% of sales from private labels, they average 2% pre-tax profits from all
sales. By contrast, European grocery stores such as Sainsbury’s, with 54% of its sales coming from private

33

similar results for the remaining 15 categories.
Among the 19 categories included in our dataset, the toothbrush category (Table 5)
attains the highest average value of our “preferred” lower bound markup ratio with a
category average of 3.44. Within the category, four types of Crest Toothbrush (of
different size and strength) attain a markup ratio in the range of 5.48-5.80, and two types
of Reach Toothbrush attain markup values of 4.36 and 4.56. The results for the remaining
products in this category suggest more moderate market power with markup ratios in the
range of 1.56 for Johnson and Johnson Floss Wax Mint and 1.49 for Pepsodent
Toothbrush.
The manufacturers’lower bound markup ratios calculated using the wholesale prices
attain even higher values. For example, for the four Crest and two Reach toothbrushes,

µ w falls in the range of 13.00-19.84. Overall, the category average of these markup
figures is 10.43. The reasons for these very high measured markup figures, unique to the
toothbrush category, remain a mystery.
The figures in the last two columns of Table 5 suggest that the retailer’s markup on
private label products in this category far exceeds its markup ratio on the corresponding
nationally branded product by nearly an order of magnitude. For example, for the highest
markup brand, the Crest Toothbrush, the retailer’s markup ratio is only 1.14, while the
markup ratio on the corresponding private label is 7.03. Overall, the retailer’s average
markup ratio for nationally branded products in this category, equals 1.37, while the
average markup ratio for private label products equals 4.87.
Finally, the lower bound markup ratios calculated using the retail prices are more
moderate, although for the top four products, the ratio still exceeds 3.00 and for another
two products it is close to 3.00. The category average for this ratio is 2.33.
For the remaining 18 categories we find more moderate markup figures.
Nevertheless, in most categories they are quite substantial. For example, for the analgesics
category reported in Table 6, the average of our “preferred” lower bound markup ratio is
1.84. Several products in this category have especially high markup ratios. For example,
the “preferred” lower bound on the markup ratio for Children’s Anacin-3 Tablets is 4.99
labels, and Tesco, with 41%, average 7% pretax profits” (Quelch and Harding, 1996).

34

(column 1). Four other products with especially high markup ratios are Panadol Children’s
Tablets with the lower bound markup ratio of 3.91, followed by Tylenol Extra Strength
Caplets with 2.53, Tylenol Tablets (Regular) with 2.44, and Bayer Children’s Aspirin with
a markup ratio of 2.28.21
Turning to the manufacturers’markup ratios calculated using the wholesale prices
)
(column 2), we find that they are quantitatively very similar to the values of µ , with the
exception of Children’s Anacin-3 Tablets, with a manufacturer’s lower bound markup
ratio of 7.62, and Panadol Children’s Tablets, with a manufacturer’s lower bound markup
ratio of 6.73. Further, as we move down the list from the highest “preferred” lower bound
to the lowest, the discrepancy between the two ratios essentially disappears, as expected.
Overall, the lower bound manufacturers’markup ratios calculated using wholesale prices
are high. For example, the figures in the table indicate that for 7 of the 24 products in this
category, the manufacturers’lower bound markup ratio exceeds 2.00, and for another 10
products the ratio exceeds 1.7. Only for two products, both Tylenol Extra-Strength
w
Tablets (different sizes), is µ below 1.2. Overall, the average manufacturer’s lower

bound markup ratio for this category equals 2.01.
The figures in the third column of Table 6, which measure the lower bound on the full
markup using retail prices, are smaller than the first two ratios, as predicted by the
inequalities derived in section II-c. Still, the markup ratios we obtain for the analgesics
category are large. For example, of the 24 products, for three products, Children’s
Anacin-3 Tablets, Panadol Children’s Tablets, and Tylenol Extra Strength Caplet, the
markup ratio calculated using only the retail prices exceeds 2.0, for 10 other products the
ratio exceeds 1.6, and for another 8 products the markup ratio exceeds 1.3. The average
markup ratio using retail prices for the analgesics category, equals 1.63.
Finally, the retailer’s markup on the national brand systematically exceeds its markup
on the private label. For example, for 23 of the 24 products (Bayer Children’s Aspirin
being the only exception), the retailer’s markup on nationally branded products in this
category is less than 1.15, with an overall average of only 1.04. In contrast, the markup
21

Ernie Berndt noted that the extraordinarily high markups on children’s medicine might possibly be
explained by parents’ risk aversion regarding their children’s health.

35

ratio on the private label is substantially higher, averaging 1.25.
Next consider the cereals category. According to Table 7, all of the markup figures
we find in this category are smaller than those we reported for the analgesics category. As
the figures in the first column of the table suggest, here the “preferred” lower bound
markup ratio falls in the range 1.27-1.57 with an average of 1.41, again suggestive of very
substantial market power. Total Raisin Bran attains the highest lower bound value with
1.57, followed by Kellog’s Corn Flakes with 1.54, and Post Raisin Bran and Kellog’s Nut
& Honey, each with a lower bound markup ratio of 1.41.
The manufacturers’markup figures reported in the second column of Table 7 are only
slightly higher than the “preferred” lower bound figures. For example, for Total Raisin
Bran, the lower bound on the manufacturer’s markup ratio equals 1.61, in comparison to
the “preferred” lower bound of 1.57. The manufacturers’markup and the “preferred”
markup figures are equally close for the remaining products of the category. Overall,
cereal manufacturers on average mark up their branded product prices to 1.43 of their
marginal cost.
According to the third column of Table 7, the markup ratios we obtain using retail
prices average 1.26 for the cereal’s category. Total Raisin Bran still attains the highest
value with 1.46, while Kellog’s Corn Flakes’markup ratio is a distant second with a value
of 1.23. Finally, comparing the retailer’s markup ratio on branded products and to its
markup ratio on private labels, we again find that the latter, 1.19 on average, exceeds the
former, 1.07 on average.
It is instructive to compare our markup figures in this category to existing
econometric estimates. The category of breakfast cereals has been a subject of several
recent studies, such as Hausman (1997) and Nevo (2001). Nevo presents estimates of
price-marginal cost margins under different assumptions on market structure, and finds
that they range from about a 1.3 to as high as 2.0, very much consistent with the lower
bound measures reported here.
As a final example, consider the crackers category, in which we were able to find 10
matching pairs of national brand-private label products. According to Table 8, our
“preferred” lower bound markup figures are relatively high, with the highest ratio for

36

Nabisco Premium Saltines (2.84), and the lowest for Salerno Graham Cracker (1.34); the
overall category average is 2.07. For four branded products, two Nabisco Premium
Saltines (different sizes) and two Salerno Saltines (also different sizes), the ratio exceeds
2.00. Only for two products is the lower bound markup ratio less than 1.40.
The manufacturers’lower bound markup ratios (second column of Table 8)
substantially exceed the “preferred” lower bound figures. For example, the category
average of the manufacturers’lower bound markup equals 2.57, which is about 25 percent
higher than the “preferred” lower bound. Further, for Nabisco Premium Saltines, the
manufacturer’s lower bound markup ratio is 4.22, about 50 percent higher than the
corresponding “preferred” lower bound.
It turns out that in the crackers category we obtain especially high markup figures
even if we consider the lower bound on the full markup ratio calculated using only the
retail prices. For example, according to Table 8 (column 3), the category average of this
markup ratio is 2.00, which is the second highest (the toothbrush category being first)
amongst all 19 categories included in our study. Individual product markup ratios
calculated using the retail prices range from the highest ratio of 3.12 for Nabisco Premium
Saltine to 1.20 for Salerno Graham Cracker.
Finally, if we consider the retailer’s markup on the nationally branded and private
label products, we find that as before, the retailer’s markup on the private label is
systematically higher than its markup on the nationally branded product, with an average
of 1.50 in contrast to 1.15, a difference of about 20 percent.22
Next, consider some specific products that stand out in other categories. In the
canned soup category (Table A1), the only nationally branded product with a “preferred”
lower bound markup ratio in excess of two is Campbell’s Tomato Soup with a ratio of
2.61. The remaining products in this category attain a markup value of less than 2.00. In
the cookies category (Table A2), two brand name products, Nutter Butter Peanut Butter
and Cameo Crème Sandwich, each attain a “preferred” lower bound markup ratio of about

22

Slade (1998) assumes a 20 percent retail markup for Saltine crackers in her study of price adjustment
costs at several Pennsylvania grocery stores. This is equivalent to a retailer’s markup ratio of 1.20. The
average retailer’s markup ratio on the nationally branded product we report is 1.15 with the inter-quartile
range of (1.12-1.17), indeed very close to what Slade assumes.

37

2.70, and another ten products attain markup values exceeding 1.40. In the snack cracker
category (Table A3), Nabisco Ritz Cracker attains the highest “preferred” lower bound
markup ratio of 1.74, followed by Nabisco Ritz Bits with a ratio of 1.58.
In the soft drinks category (Table A4), we find that Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi Cola
attain “preferred” lower bound markup values of 3.83 and 2.36, respectively. Other
branded products with particularly high lower bound markup ratios in the soft drink
category are Schweppes Ginger Ale with 3.52, Snapple Strawberry and Snapple Pink
Lemonade with 2.88 and 2.47, respectively, Pepsi Diet with 2.28, and Seagrams Ginger
Ale with 2.18. Diet Coke attains a more moderate lower bound markup ratio of 1.69.
Finally, the nationally branded products attaining the highest “preferred” lower bound
markup ratios in the remaining categories include Motts Apple Juice in the bottled juice
category, Minute Maid Pink Lemonade in the frozen juice category, Crest Regular in the
toothpaste category, Kraft Soft Philly Cream Cheese in the cheese category, Dawn Lemon
in the dish detergent category, L.C. Bakes Cheese Ravioli in the frozen entrees category,
Bounce Single Scented in the fabric softener category, Trac II Plus Cart 10 in the
grooming products category, Ultra Ivory-Snow in the laundry detergent category, Quick
Quaker Oats in the oatmeal category, and C.O.S. Lite Tuna in Water in the canned tuna
category.
VI. Discussion
It might be worthwhile to hypothesize as to the determinants of cross-category and
within-category variation in the magnitude of markup ratios. Consider first the withincategory variation. In most categories, we find that more heavily branded and well-known
products achieve higher markups. For example, Kellog’s Corn Flakes, Nabisco Premium
Saltine crackers, Crest, Coca-Cola Classic, Motts Apple Juice, Nutter Butter Peanut
Butter, Nabisco Ritz Crackers, Kraft Cream Cheese, Dawn Lemon dish detergent, Bounce
Single Scented fabric softener, etc., which have the highest markups within respective
categories, all are heavily advertised and widely recognized nationally branded products.
Perhaps a more interesting issue is the variation in markup ratios across product
categories. Basu and Fernald (1997) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1996) provide the

38

following formula linking the gross output markups that are the focus of this paper to the
value added markups, via products material share:

µv =

µ (1 − s )
,
1 − µs

where µ v denotes the markup on real value added, s denotes the intermediate inputs share
in total revenue, and µ denotes the gross output markup. The formula implies that if the
value added markup is to be finite, the gross output markup must not exceed 1/s.
Nevo (2001) using data from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers over the period
1988-1992, provides materials share figures for Ready-to-Eat Cereals (SIC 2043) and for
the food industry overall (SIC 20). For cereals, he reports a materials share of 26.5
percent, which from the above formula implies that the gross output markup should not
exceed 1/0.265 = 3.77. Indeed, according to our findings (see Table 1), the “preferred”
lower bound markup ratio for the cereals category equals 1.41, well below the upper
bound imposed by the above formula.
For the entire food industry, Nevo reports a materials share of 63.4 percent. This
imposes an upper bound of 1.58 on the gross output markup ratio. Twelve of the 19
categories we study would be classified as food. These are soft drinks, crackers, canned
soups, oatmeal, cookies, snack crackers, cereals, bottled juice, cheese, frozen juice, frozen
entrees, and canned tuna. Of these 12 categories, the numerical values of the “preferred”
markup ratios for the last 8 categories fall below 1.58. For two additional categories
(oatmeal and canned soups), the markup ratio is only slightly higher than 1.58. For only
two categories (crackers and soft drinks), does the markup ratio exceed 1.58 substantially.
This suggests that materials share in these two categories must be smaller than 26.5
percent, which seems reasonable.23
Finally, without having actual data on the cost shares of intermediate inputs used by
manufacturers of individual food categories, we strongly suspect that the products with
the lowest markup ratios, such as canned tuna, frozen entrees, cheese, frozen juice, and
23

Moreover, the inter-quartile ranges we report indicate that the great majority of the products in each one
of the 12 categories satisfy this constraint.

39

bottled juice, also have the highest share of materials.24
VII. Concluding Remarks
In this paper we study the size of markups for nationally branded products sold in a
large U.S. retail supermarket chain. Our approach, which we hope will serve as a
complement to more structural econometric approaches, treats the wholesale price of a
comparable private label product as an upper bound on the marginal costs faced by the
brand manufacturer. Using scanner data from a large Midwestern chain, we have
computed various upper and lower bound markup ratios for over 230 products in 19
categories. We found that markup ratios measured this way range from 3.44 for
toothbrushes and 2.23 for soft drinks to about 1.15–1.20 for canned tuna and frozen
entrees, with the majority of categories falling in the range 1.40–2.10. Lower bounds on
manufacturers’markups are even higher. Thus the data indicate that markups on nationally
branded products sold in U.S. supermarkets are large.
Our approach offers several benefits. Because it involves only a simple computation
(once the data have been assembled), the method permits calculation of markups for a
large variety of products. It is transparent and intuitive, and it offers a benchmark
comparison for more structural approaches.
Particularly in light of the importance of markups in recent macroeconomic discourse,
one might ask whether the finding of high markups for heavily advertised differentiated
products generalizes to the economy at large. In this direction, it is worth noting that
many “commodity” products such as automotive parts, personal computers and their
components, and many other producers’goods come in both branded and non-branded
(OEM) versions, and that the price gap for those products is comparable to that for the
supermarket goods we have studied. This is also true for other consumer goods sold
outside the supermarket industry, home and office supply products being one example.

We are grateful to Susanto Basu for calling our attention to the above formula and its implications.
Ernie Berndt noted that the extraordinarily high markups on children’s medicine might possibly be
explained by parents’ risk aversion regarding their children’s health.
