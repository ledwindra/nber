    "abstract": "\n\nThis review essay of the two-volume Cambridge History of Capitalism (2014), edited by Larry Neal and Jeffrey G. Williamson, is divided into three parts.  First, I describe three chapters from the second volume that I recommend for all economists to add depth to their understanding of the world economy today.  Robert C. Allen analyzes the world distribution of income; Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung discuss the history of business groups; and Peter Lindert surveys private and public programs to help the poor.  In each case, they analyze historical backgrounds that illuminate current issues. Second, I criticize the definition of capitalism used in these volumes as too expansive to be useful.  I argue that this definition mars the essays in first volume by stimulating a fruitless search for capitalism in the millennium before the Industrial Revolution.  Third, I describe the essays in this reference work starting from the most recent and ending with those about antiquity.\n\n",
