THE EXTENT OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN LONGITUDINAL EARNINGS DATA:
DO TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT?

ABSTRACT

This

paper examines the properties and prevalence of measurement

error in longitudinal earnings data. The analysis compares Current
Population Survey data to administrative Social Security payroll tax
records for a sample of heads of households over two years. In contrast.
to the typically assumed properties of measurement error, the results
indicate that errors are serially correlated over two years and
negatively correlated with true earnings (i.e., mean reverting).
Moreover, reported earnings are more reliable for females than males.
Overall, the ratio of the variance of the signal to the total variance is

.82 for men and .92 for women. These ratios fall to .65 and .81 when the

data are specified in first-differences. The estimates suggest that
longitudinal earnings data may be more reliable than previously believed.

Without knowing the extent of the falsifications that actually occur
in economic statistics, it is impossible to estimate their influence
upon economic theory.
Oskar Morgenstern

Economists have long been concerned that mismeasurement of data

leads to spurious results or obscures true economic relationships.1 This
concern has been heightened by the increased use of longitudinal data

sets. If measurement errors are uncorrelated over time, then statistical
problems caused by the mismeasurement of economic data may be greatly
exacerbated when longitudinal data are used to estimate fixed-effects or

first-differenced regressions (Griliches and Hausman, 1986). On the
other hand, if economic data are consistently misreported over time, then
first-differencing could conceivably increase the reliability of

longitudinal data. This paper examines the nature and extent of response
errors in longitudinal data on individual-reported labor earnings.

The analysis uses a unique data set that links two consecutive March
Current Population Surveys (CPS) to employer-reported Social Security

earnings records. Data are thus available on each employee's
self-reported earnings and employer-reported earnings at two points in

time. Our maintained assumption is that Social Security payroll records
are a relatively accurate measure of true earnings. Although the results
are specific to annual earnings data reported in the CPS, they have
potentially important implications for a variety of empirical studies.
It is common for annual earnings to appear as a left-hand-side variable

References containing discussions of the prevalence of measurement
error and its effects include Morgenstern (1963), Griliches (1974, 1985),

(1985), and Solon (1987).

in human capital earnings regressions, and as a right-hand—side variable
in unemployment duration models, labor supply studies, consumption

functions, and other empirical analyses. Particularly in the area of
labor supply, many researchers have come to conclude that measurement
error in earnings has a dominant impact on empirical findings (e.g.,

Altonji, 1986, Abowd and Card, 1987, and Ashenfelter, 1984) A better
understanding of the nature and magnitude of measurement error is
necessary to properly account for its influence on empirical analyses.

The paper is organized as follows. Section one describes the data
set that we use. Section two reviews the effect that measurement errors
have on econometric analyses under a variety of assumptions, and presents
a convenient summary statistic to measure the reliability of a variable.
Section three estimates the properties of measurement error in

longitudinal earnings data. The analysis uses Social Security payroll
records as a measure of true earnings, and estimates limited dependent
variable models to account for the censoring of Social Security earnings

at the taxable maximum. In section four we address several potential
problems that might affect the robustness and representativeness of our
results.

The main findings of the paper can be simply summarized:
Differencing CPS earnings exacerbates measurement error problems, but

even in the first-differenced data there is more news than noise. Our
estimates suggest that for men greater than 80% of the measured
cross-sectional variation in yearly earnings corresponds to true

variation, while nearly 65% of the observed variation in

first—differenced earnings is true variation. For the sample of women
these figures rise to 90% in the cross-section and 80% in

—3-

first—differences. Horeover, measurement error appears to be positively
auto—correlated over two years, and negatively correlated with true

earnings. These last two findings are inconsistent with the assumptions
of classical measurement error which are typically employed in empirical
studies.

I. Data
The CPS is a widely used source of labor market data. A stratified,
cluster sample containing about 55,000 households is surveyed every
month, and half of the households are resurveyed the following year.2
Each March the Annual Demographic Supplement to the CPS asks individuals
a question on their annual labor earnings in the previous calendar year.
If an individual is not home at the time of the survey, another household

member is asked to give a "proxy response" for that individual. The
annual earnings question is deliberately asked in the month of March
because it is hoped that individuals will be especially knowledgeable of
their income at this time of year since income tax returns are due in

April. The annual earnings concept in the CPS is meant to reflect all
wages, salary, tips and bonuses before deductions received from employment in the preceding calendar year.
The diagram in Figure 1 outlines the steps we took to generate a

longitudinal employer-employee data set with CPS data. The starting
point was the 1978 CPS-SER Exact Match File. This file was created by a
joint project of the Census Bureau and Social Security Administration
(SSA), and contains survey responses for persons in the March 1978 CPS

Annual Demographic File linked to their respective earnings information
in

SSA administrative records. Individuals in the March

1978 CPS were

asked a supplemental question on their social security number. If the
social security number of the head of the household was not obtained in

Households in the selected addresses are in the survey for four
consecutive months, not interviewed for the following eight months, and

then back in the survey for a final four months. Thus, in any given

month half of the households will be re-interviewed the following year,
and

the other half were interviewed in the previous year.

The match between social security earnings histories and the March 1978 CPS was carried Out by the
Census Bureau and Social Security Administration.
The authors matched the March 1977 CPS to the
March 1978 CPS for household heads on the basis of household ID numbers and personal characteristics.
The 1978 ELS Micro Data File containing information on the household respondent and type of interview
was merged to the data set by the authors on the basis of unique household identifiers. Similar information can not be matched for 1977 because of changes in the identification codes in the BLS Micro
Data File.

the initial interview, CPS surveyors were instructed to call the

household again. Exact matches between CPS and SSA records were then
identified on the basis of the respondent's social security number, name,

age, sex, race and line number. Table 1 gives the sample size at each
step of the way for the sample of household heads. In only about half of
the cases could respondents to the CPS survey be positively linked to
their corresponding Social Security records.
The resulting matched CPS-SER file contains a single cross-section
of responses to the tlarch CPS questions for 1978, and a time—series of

annual covered SSA earnings records for each individual from 1950 to

1978. The Social Security earnings records are taken directly from
employer-reported Form 941 quarterly payroll tax records, which are used
by the Social Security Administration to calculate OASDHI benefits and

determine insured status. Nearly 99 percent of the population we examine
is in covered employment (Alvey and Cobleigh, 1980). One important
limitation of the SSA earnings data is that earnings are censored at the

taxable maximum. The maximum was $16,500 in 1977 and $15,300 in 1976.
Although in these years relatively few women (5%) have earnings above the
Social Security earnings ceiling, nearly half of the males' earnings are
censored at the earnings maximum.

The CPS earnings question and Social Security earnings records

closely approximate the same concept. In fact, CPS surveyors are allowed
to examine respondents' tax forms and W2 statements if they are offered

during the interview. And surveyors are explicitly instructed as to
which line of the tax form to use in filling—out the questionnaire.3 It

however, how often tax forms are actually referred to in
CPS interviews.4

To create a longitudinal data set containing employee and employer

earnings reports at two points in time, we have matched the 1977 March

CPS Annual Demographic File to the 1978 CPS-SER data set. This match is
based on each respondent's unique CPS household identification number,

age, education, sex and race. Half of the observations in the March 1977
CPS are in rotation groups that are re-interviewed in the March 1978 CPS.
Because the match between CPS and SSA records is most accurate and

complete for heads of households, we focus solely on this group. About
two-thirds of the observations in the appropriate rotation groups in the
1978 CPS could be successfully matched to the 1977 CPS.

The 1978 and 1977 March CPS Public Use Demographic Files do not
contain information on whether earnings data are reported by individuals
directly through a self-response or by another household member in a

proxy response. Since whether an individual answered a question directly
by him or herself may influence the accuracy of the response, and since
the likelihood of self—response may differ systematically across groups
of the population (e.g. males and females), this is a potentially

important omission. However, the BLS Basic Micro-Data File, which is
used internally by the BLS, contains information on the identification of

the individual who answered the household questions. The person who
answered the household questions most likely self-responded to the

earnings question as well. We obtained the 1978 BLS Basic Micro-Data
File from the Census Bureau and merged it to the CPS-SER. Unfortunately,

Two other widely used labor market surveyors, PSID and NLS, similarly
allow surveyors to examine tax records.

—7—

because of inconsistencies in the BLS Basic Micro—Data File, comparable
information cannot be merged to the Demographic File for 1977.
Nonetheless, the additional information on the household respondent for
1978 gives some indication of the effect of self-response on the accuracy
of earnings data.

We narrow the sample to private, nonagricultural workers with

positive CPS and Social Security earnings. Individuals who did not report their earnings to CPS and were then assigned earnings via the "hot

deck" procedure are also eliminated from the sample.5 We further
eliminate from the sample workers who earned any self-employment income
during the year or were in occupations that are likely to receive tips.
Most importantly, to improve the accuracy of the Social Security earnings
data we restrict the sample to workers whose longest job during the year

was in a covered industry and occupation.6 Despite these final
restrictions, individuals who move between covered and uncovered
employment during the course of the year will have lower Social Security

earnings than true earnings. As a result, in specifications estimated in
section three we further limit the sample to employees who have only one
employer during the year. Earnings for these workers should •consist
entirely of covered earnings.

See Lillard, Smith and Welch (1986) for a description and analysis of
the hot deck procedure used by the Census Bureau to impute incomes of
nonrespondents.
6

Employees in the following occupations are eliminated from the sample
because they are not covered by the Social Security Act or because they
are likely to receive unreported tips: bartenders, busboys, waiters,
baggage porters, barbers, bootblacks, hairdressers, housekeepers,
laundresses, maids, taxicab drivers, newsboys, clergymen, religious
workers N.E.C., farmers, and agriculture and fisheries workers.

-8-

The three-way link between the 1978 CL'S, Social Security, and 1977
CL'S, and the subsequent restrictions placed on the sample resulted in a

great deal of sample attrition (see Table 1). Since in the process of
matching observations over time and between data sources we have
eliminated from the sample individuals with inconsistent responses to the
age, sex, education or race questions, there is reason to suspect that

the final sample is biased in the direction of giving more accurate
responses than the typical employee.

Despite the difficulty in matching the various data sets and the
imposed sample restrictions, the comparison between the means of several
key variables in the final sample and the population of privately
employed heads of households shown in Table 2 suggests that the sample
may be reasonably representative of its population.

In particular, the

mean age, education, weeks worked, and self-response rate in the final

sample and in the full March 1978 CPS are similar. On the other hand,
the average reported CL'S earnings for calendar year 1977 is 11% greater

for men and 21% greater for women in the final sample than in the full
CL'S. This difference in part reflects higher average earnings of covered
jobs than uncovered jobs, the deletion of workers with self-employment
income, and the restriction that workers in the CPS-SER sample have
positive earnings in two consecutive years.

II. Models of Measurement Error
We assume an individual's reported earnings in natural logarithms in
year t. (CPS) equals his true log earnings (ri) plus an error

CpSt =

r1 ÷ u.

In the case of "classical" measurement error it is assumed that

identically, independently distributed with E(v) =

is

cov(r1, v) = 0.

In

what shall be called mean reverting measurement error, we assume E(v)

0 and cov(q, v) 0]
There are several plausible alternative measures of the accuracy of

economic data.8 First, the variance of v (at) is directly related
to the noise added to the residual variance of a cross—sectional
regression when the dependent variable contains an additive white noise

error component. If the dependent variable is specified in
first-differences and we assume that error variances are constant over
time, then the variability added to an OLS regression because of

correlation coefficient of V.

If

2a2(l-p)

where p is the serial

the measurement error in the dependent

variable is correlated with any of the independent variables, however,
the measurement error problem is more severe since the estimated
coefficients will be biased and inconsistent.

Perhaps a more useful summary measure relates to the magnitude of
the attenuation bias imparted on an OLS regression coefficient because an

independent variable is measured with error. In the simplest case of a
cross-sectional bivariate regression where the independent variable
(earnings) is reported with an additive white noise error, the
proportional attenuation bias is given asymptotically by 1-X, where

We refer to this case as "mean reverting" measurement error because as
and
shown below we find a negative correlation between

measurement error.

A =
+

The quantity A is often referred to as the reliability of the data.
If the independent variable is measured in first-differences and if
we assume that both true earnings and measurement error are stationary

series, then the reliability of CPSt is:

a2
2 (1-p)

2

an+ , (1-r)

where r is the first order serial correlation in true earnings, and p is

the first order serial correlation in measurement error. If the
(positive) serial correlation in earnings exceeds the (positive) serial
correlation in measurement error, the attenuation bias will be greater in
longitudinal data than in cross-sectional data (Griliches and Hausman,
1986).

In the more general case when cov(qt, v)

0, the simple

signal-to-total-variance formulas are no longer appropriate estimates of

the reliability of the data. It can easily be shown that a nonzero
covariance between

and v leads to the addition of covariance terms to

the numerator and denominator of the least squares attenuation bias

formula (1-A). However, the generalization of the reliability formulas
can be compactly written as

=

cov(CPS,

var(CPSt)

—11—

for cross—sectional data, and as

=

cov(CPS,

&i)

var (CPS)

for first-differenced data.

The reliability of a variable in the general case, it should be
noted, is just the slope coefficient from an OLS regression of the
correctly measured variable on the mismeasured variable.9 As a result, A
can also be interpreted as the proportion of a change in the observed
variable that translates into a change in the true, latent variable.

III. Results
To implement the above formulas, we initially assume that Social

Security payroll records are an accurate measure of true earnings (or
that any error in Social Security earnings records is sufficiently small

that it can safely be ignored), and measure q by the log of
employer-reported Social Security earnings data denoted SSEt. We

calculate v by the formula

CPS - SSEt.

The subscript t refers to

wages in period 1 (1976) or period 2 (1977).
If the measurement error is "classical" in the sense that
cov(flt, v) =

0, the sample of workers whose earnings fall below the

Social Security taxable maximum (K) yields a random sample of v. This
convenient result follows because selecting workers on the condition that
<

Kt

is equivalent to sampling on an orthogonal variable. More

generally, however, if

and Vt

are not independent, sampling on

will

It should also be noted that these estimates of A are robust to the
presence of additive white noise measurement error in the variable used
to measure

-12-

Leave us with a nonrandom sample of

We subsequently handle this

truncation problem by making the standard assumption of joint normality.

Figure 2 presents a plot of the density of v for men who were below
the Social Security earnings limit in 1977, and Figure 3 Contains a

similar plot for women. Both plots show a symmetric, unimodal
distribution of errors. Although the distribution is bell shaped the
tails are thicker than one would expect with a normal distribution (the
standard deviation of

in each case is more than three times its

interquartile range). In addition, the plots display a large spike near
zero -- 14% of the women and 12% of the men report earnings that match

their Social Security Form 941 earnings to the exact dollar amount, and
more than 40% of male and female respondents are within 2.5 percent.
The summary statistics given at the bottom of the figures indicate
that in these truncated samples, measurement error has approximately a
zero mean, although women have a slight tendency to under-report their

earnings. Furthermore, the magnitude of the error is substantial. The
error variance is slightly greater than .10 for men and .05 for women.
The error variance represents 27.6% of the total variance in CPS earnings

for men and 8.9% for women. Below we explore whether the seemingly
greater accuracy in earnings data for women can be explained by their
higher propensity to self-respond to the survey.
We next turn our attention to the question of the potential biases
these errors might have on the estimation of economic relationships.
Using an error-ridden measure of earnings as a left-hand-side variable

will produce biased results only if Vt (or Vt) is correlated with a

right-hand-side regressor. Table 3 presents results of regressing V on
a

variety

of typical human capital and demographic variables. Tobit

-13—

procedures are used to account for truncation of Social Security earnings

data. The results indicate, for example, that earnings of younger men
and married men tend to be under-reported.
The magnitude of the coefficients reported in the table equals the

magnitude of the bias expected for these variables when earnings is the

dependent variable of a regression. Although the coefficients in each
Tobit are jointly statistically significant, the estimated bias for each
variable is small compared to its typical effect in an earnings equation.

The R2's implied by these equations are between .01 and .02 for men, and
between .05 and .09 for women.

10

These results suggest that the

mismeasurement of earnings leads to little bias when CPS earnings are on
the left-hand-side of a regression.

Variance-Covariance Matrix of True Earnings and Measurement Error

Next we estimate the variance-covariance matrix of

and v. This

matrix is of interest because it gives an indication of the magnitude and

covariance structure of measurement error over two years. Since Social
Security earnings reports in our data set are censored at the taxable
maximum, we must impute the latent variance-covariance matrix.

Below we

give a brief description of the limited dependent variable techniques

that are used to account for the censoring problem. A rigorous
derivation of our estimator is presented in the Appendix.

These R2's are calculated as

The easiest way to describe our estimation procedure is as a three
of

step process. In the first step we estimate the parameters
the following two equation system:

SSE a1 + 1CPS1

SSE

=

a2

+

2CPS1

+

+

y1CPS2

j2CPS2

+

+

where SSE is the latent, unobserved Social Security earnings record.
The equations are jointly estimated by maximum likelihood assuming a
bivariate Tobit likelihood function which allows for a covariance in the
error terms

(a 12

).

Once the parameters of the system are estimated, in the second step
the following consistent formulas are used to derive the latent elements
of the CPS—SSE covariance matrix:

Var(SSE) =

Var(CPS1)

Cov(SSE,SSE)

Finally, in the third step the resulting variance-covariance matrix
of CPS and SSE is used to derive the variance—covariance matrix of q and

transformations are listed in the Appendix.11
Table 4 reports the MILE imputed variance-covariance matrix of

for the full sample of males. The table also reports the observed
variance—covariance matrix for the truncated sample of males who earned

less than the Social Security maximum. Table 5 contains the
corresponding estimates for the sample of female workers.
As expected, the imputed variances of Social Security earnings
ca2

) exceed the corresponding variances for the noncensored sample.

Fit

Furthermore,

the first order serial correlation in Social Security

earnings increases from .635 in the noncensored subsample to .776 in the
imputed full sample for men, and from .689 to .914 for women.

The limited dependent variable techniques were employed to allow for
a nonzero covariance between

and v. The results suggest that this

estimation technique was necessary since there are large negative
correlations between measurement error and true earnings for men,
exceeding - .40 in each year. However, for women the negative correlation

between measurement error and true earnings is quite small in absolute

magnitude. This result implies that measurement errors lead male
workers' reported earnings to regress to the mean earnings level)2
Because of the likelihood of mean reverting error, we will focus our
attention on the MILE results, although all of our qualitative conclusions
are unchanged in the truncated sample.

In practice, we found it more convenient to reparameterize the
likelihood function in terms of the parameters of interest and estimate
the variance-covariance matrix in one step. Although conceptually
equivalent, this approach has the advantage of yielding the appropriate
asymptotic standard errors.
12

Duncan and Mathiowetz (1985) obtain similar results for a sample of
(primarily male) workers in one production plant.

-16—

The results strongly suggest that reporting errors in CPS earnings

are positively correlated from one year to the next. The implied
auto-correlation coefficient of

is .40 for men, and .10 for women.

This finding implies that a substantial portion of the measurement error
in CPS earnings will "cancel out" when earnings data are differenced.

Unfortunately, with only two years of data it is impossible to
distinguish an auto-regressive process in the measurement error from a
person fixed-effect or from other time-series processes.

Reliability of the Data
We next turn to the magnitude of the attenuation bias that these

results imply. Table 6 presents maximum likelihood estimates of the
reliability coefficient (X) with and without taking account of the
covariance between

and v.13 The results for male workers are

reported for the full sample, and then for subsamples of self-respondents
(in period 2) and males who had only one employer over the year.

Unfortunately, a comparable disaggregated analysis for women is
infeasible because of the small sample size.
First consider the cross—sectional results for the full samples.

Under the assumption of classical measurement error, the reliability of
CPS earnings data is in the low eighty percent range for men, and the low

ninety percent range for women. Allowing for mean reverting measurement
error substantially increases these estimates for men, but only slightly

for women. This is precisely the direction of the effect of mean
reverting measurement error on X that one would expect if

13

a2 <

The reliability coefficients are just transformations of the
covariance matrix of CPS and SSE. This is described in the Appendix.

—17—

It is interesting to compare our estimate of A to that found by
Duncan and Hill (1985) in their evaluation study of the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics. Using self-reported earnings data and employer records
for the employees of one manufacturing plant, they estimate that the
signal-to-total-variance ratio (assuming classical measurement error) for

log annual earnings in 1982 is .76. The signal-to—total variance ratio
is somewhat smaller in Duncan and Hill's evaluation study than here, but

this difference may at least in part be attributable to the lower
variance of the signal inherent in studying one plant.
The results in Table 6 further show that measurement error bias is
exacerbated by taking first differences of the CPS earnings data.

Nonetheless, the point estimates of the reliability coefficient for CPS
in the .78 to .85 range should give solace to those who feared that
little could be learned from longitudinal studies of earnings because

most of the observed changes in these panel data were due to noise. Both
the positive serial correlation and mean reversion in the errors increase
the reliability of first-differenced data relative to the case of
classical measurement error.

To examine the effect of self versus proxy responses on the accuracy
of CPS data, we separately examine the subsample of male workers who
self-reported their earnings for the calendar year 1977 in the 1978 CPS.
Interestingly, there is little evidence that this sample of workers has

more reliable data than the entire sample. Mellow and Sider (1983)
similarly find that self—responded answers to a variety of CPS questions

are not more accurate than proxy responses. This result is particularly
relevant for comparisons between men and women because women heads of

households are far more likely to self—respond to the CPS than men (see
Table 2).

The final subsample that we examine is the group of male workers who
were employed by a single firm in each of the two consecutive years

analyzed. We focus on this sub—sample because Social Security earnings
records are likely to be particularly accurate for these workers as they

were exclusively employed in covered employment. Interestingly, the
results show very similar estimates of the reliability of the data for

the single employer sample of workers and the full sample. This finding
suggests that possible bias in the estimates of X due to incomplete
coverage of Social Security earnings records is not an important problem.

IV. Potential Problems
Our strategy has been to use Social Security earnings data as a
proxy for true earnings to estimate the nature and magnitude of

measurement error. It is worth asking how sensitive our conclusions are

to a variety of potential problems. We see three major ones. First,
Social Security earnings records may not be an accurate measure of

individuals' earnings. Second, the sample we use may be unrepresentative
in a number of important respects. Third, our estimates may be sensitive
to the distributional assumptions we make to account for the truncation

in Social Security earnings records. Although we believe that each of
these points has some force, we do not believe our conclusions are driven

by these potential problems. Below we consider each potential problem in
turn.

—19—

a. Errors in Social Security Earnings Records
Social Security earnings records may be inaccurate for our purposes

for a variety of reasons: Earnings records may be matched to the wrong
person; employer tax reports may be inaccurate; individuals might have

some income from uncovered or under-the-table jobs. Five factors lead us
to believe that our findings are not a direct result of measurement error
in Social Security data.

First, we have chosen our samples to minimize errors in Social
Security data by requiring that administrative records match CPS records

on the basis of age, race, sex and Social Security numbers. Second, our
results are not qualitatively changed when we narrow the sample to males
whose only job was in covered employment over the year.
Third, the cross-sectional estimates of measurement error implied by
our data are similar to those found by other researchers using different
data sets (e.g., Duncan and Hill, 1985, and Nellow and Sider, 1983).
Fourth, white noise measurement error in Social Security earnings would

spuriously induce a negative covariance between

and fl. While a

negative covariance is found for men, the corresponding covariance for
women is virtually zero, and there is no obvious reason to suspect that

Social Security earnings records are more accurate for women than men.
Lastly, we should emphasize that additive white noise measurement
error in Social Security earnings would lead the reliability statistics
we report in the text to be either downward biased (when X equals the
signal-to-total-variance ratio) or unbiased (when X is the slope

coefficient from the regression of the true variable on the mismeasured
variable).

-20-

b.

RepresentativefleSS of Sample

Of necessity, we restrict our samples to heads of households who
remained at the same address over two years, who are successfully matched
to their Social Security records, and who received earnings from covered

employment in two consecutive years. Imposing these restrictions might
generate a sample of individuals that is more reliable than the overall

population.14 While this is true, we doubt that the nature of our sample
can explain our results. As mentioned in section one, as far as
observable characteristics are concerned the sample is not very different

from the full CPS. Furthermore, many of the sample restrictions we
impose are similar to the ones imposed by other researchers in analyzing

longitudinal earnings data. Thus, the results are reasonably
representative of the kinds of samples often analyzed.

c. Normality
We assume joint normality of CPS and SSE to estimate many of the
statistics in the paper. The spike at zero and the thick tails in the
distribution of

are indicative of non-normality. Nonetheless, there

are three reasons to believe that our conclusions are not due to this
a s S

umpt ion.
First, when we re-estimate the models by maximum likelihood

eliminating the spike at zero and the outliers, the conclusions are

qualitatively unchanged. Second, our estimates are similar when we focus
solely on the truncated sample. And most importantly, we believe that

14

On the other hand, we note that movers might experience relatively
large true earnings changes. Therefore, excluding these workers may
reduce the signal in the data.

-21-

under plausible assumptions the truncated sample should give estimates of
the reliability of cross—sectional and first-differenced data that

understate the true reliability of the data. The intuition behind this

result is most easily seen when fl and V are uncorrelated. Since
truncation is based on r) and only indirectly affects v, we would expect
the truncation to reduce the variance of fl but not change the variance

of v. As a result, truncation leads the signal-to-total variance ratio
to increase.

To examine the robustness of this result when q and V are

correlated, we performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations. In the
first case we assumed that the fl's and V's were distributed joint

normally, and in the second case we assumed that the v's represented
mixture of normals.
Under the first assumption we generated samples of 4 random normal
variables, fl] fl2

and

with variances of .5, .5, .1 and .1

respectively. The samples were of size 1,000. We assumed that the fl's
> 0 and
and the V's were positively auto—correlated across time (p
flu 2
> 0), while the fl's and v's were negatively correlated with each
1' 2

< 0). We varied these correlations between .1 and .9 and

other
5,fit

between -.1 and - .9 respectively.

Under the second assumption (i.e., v distributed as a mixture of
normals), we generated 6 random variables, I11 fl2, C1, C,

and

with variances .5, .5, .1, .1 and .01 and .01 respectively. Each sample
size was 1,000. We assumed that the fl's, the c's and the p's were all

positively correlated over time, but that the c's and the p's were both

negatively correlated with the q's. The c's and the p's were also
assumed to be positively correlated. Again, we varied the correlations

-22—

from between .1 and .9 or from -.1 to -.9. From the 's and Ii's we
defined two new variables:

measurement error

and V2. With equal probability, the

was randomly set equal to either

or

while

was randomly set equal to either 2 or p2.
In both of the above cases we calculated X's for both the full

sample and for those with fl's > 0. In all cases that X's calculated on
the full sample were closer to 1 than they were in the truncated samples.

This was true for both cross-sectional and first differenced data. We
conclude from these simulations that truncating on the fl's will typically

induce a downward bias on reliability measures. Therefore, the X's we
estimated on the truncated samples likely underestimate the reliability
of earnings data.

V. Conclusion
This paper has estimated the properties of measurement error in
longitudinal data on earnings. Our estimates contain both good news and

bad news as far as longitudinal earnings data are concerned. The good
news first: Recent work using panel data has emphasized the fact that
differencing data can seriously exacerbate measurement error problems.
For earnings data in particular, common wisdom would seem to be that

changes are dominated by noise rather than signal. Our estimates suggest

that this view is too pessimistic. Fully 75% of the variation in the
change in earnings in CL'S data represents true earnings variation.

The bad news is that our results suggest that the simple models that
have been used to characterize measurement error in past studies are not

appropriate. In particular, the standard (classical) assumption has been
that measurement error is pure white noise. Our results indicate,

—23-

however, that measurement error in earnings data is positively

auto—correlated and negatively correlated with true earnings. A broader
range of measurement error models which allow for non—classical
measurement error might be necessary.

The time-series properties of measurement error seem especially

important. Unfortunately, with only 2 years of data it is impossible to
distinguish a moving average process in the measurement error from an

auto-regressive process or from some other time-series process. A
valuable extension of this work, therefore, would be an examination of
the time—series properties of measurement error in a longer panel of
data.

Appendix

This appendix reviews the limited dependent variable methods we used

to calculate the variety of estimates reported in the text. First, it
should be clear that all the statistics reported in the paper -- X and
—-

the variance-covarianCe matrix of r and

are straightforward

functions of the variance-covariance matrix of Social Security and CPS

earnings. Because of censoring problems this matrix is not directly
observable, but it can be imputed if we make distributional assumptions.
Specifically, we assume that Social Security and CPS earnings are

distributed normally. Consider the following two equation system which
relates Social Security earnings to CPS earnings each year:

where SSE is the latent, unobserved Social Security earnings record.
SSE is only observed if SSEt is less than the earnings maximum (Kr).
This specification is not meant to be structural. Rather, it is used to
estimate the latent variance—covariance matrix of Social Security and CPS
earnings.

Conditional on the CPS earnings, there are four additive components

to the log likelihood function describing this system. Each is presented
below.

The variance-COvariaflce elements involving only CPS earnings are

estimated directly from the observed data.

Once the variancecOvariaflCe matrix of Social Security and CPS
earnings has been estimated, it is straightforward to calculate the
variance-covariance matrix of '1 and v, and to calculate the various

reliability statistics. The variance-covariance matrix of SSE and CPS
may be written as follows:

where H is 16 x 16 matrix of l's, 0's, and -l's. H can be inverted to
solve for the variance-covariance matrix of q and v as an explicit
function of the variance-covariance matrix of SSE and CPS.

The signal-to-noise ratios are easily calculated from the

variance-covariance matrix of q and V. The reliability statistics which
are robust to mean reverting measurement error are calculated as follows:

cov(CPS, SSE)

Finally, we note that asymptotic standard errors are computed by
re—parameterizing the likelihood function in terms of the parameters of

interest using the transformations presented above. These parameters are
functions of, among other things, the variances and covariances of log

CI'S earnings. We account for the sampling variance of CPS earnings by
assuming that lOg CI'S earnings follow a joint normal distribution, and

add the joint marginal density of these earnings to the likelihood
function.
