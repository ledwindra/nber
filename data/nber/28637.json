    "abstract": "\n\nWe study the most under-utilized tax in developing countries\u2014the property tax\u2014by modeling and estimating the welfare effects of tax rate changes and enforcement. The model shows tax hikes impact welfare by reducing compliance and exacerbating liquidity constraints. Enforcement impacts welfare by subjecting non-compliant taxpayers to threats of fines and property seizure. Empirically, administrative data, sharp tax rate increases, and an enforcement experiment show both policies increase revenue. Tax hikes raise welfare since revenue gains surpass liquidity costs. Enforcement reduces welfare as threat costs overshadow revenue increases. Governments can enhance welfare by raising tax rates rather than escalating enforcement.\n\n",
