    "abstract": "\n\nWhile workplace flexibility is perceived to be a key determinant of maternal labor supply, less is known about fathers\u2019 demand for flexibility or about intra-household spillover effects of flexibility initiatives. This paper examines these issues in the context of a critical period in family life\u2014the months immediately following childbirth\u2014and identifies the impacts of paternal access to workplace flexibility on maternal postpartum health. We model household demand for paternal presence at home as a function of domestic stochastic shocks, and use variation from a Swedish reform that granted new fathers more flexibility to take intermittent parental leave during the postpartum period in a regression discontinuity difference-in-differences (RD-DD) design. We find that increasing the father\u2019s temporal flexibility reduces the risk of the mother experiencing physical postpartum health complications and improves her mental health. Our results suggest that mothers bear the burden from a lack of workplace flexibility\u2014not only directly through greater career costs of family formation, as previously documented\u2014but also indirectly, as fathers\u2019 inability to respond to domestic shocks exacerbates the maternal health costs of childbearing.\n\n",
