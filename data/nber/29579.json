    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper demonstrates that information frictions limit the labor market trajectories of young people in the U.S. We provide credible skill signals\u2014recommendation letters based on supervisor feedback\u2014to a random subset of 43,409 participants in New York City\u2019s summer jobs program. Letters increase employment the following year by 3 percentage points (4.5 percent). Earnings effects grow over 4 years to a cumulative $1,349 (4.9 percent). We find no evidence of increased job search or confidence; instead, the signals help employers better identify successful matches with high-productivity workers. But the additional work hampers on-time high school graduation, especially among low-achieving students.\n\n",
