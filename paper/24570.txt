ABSTRACT
A model is developed in which two complementary forms of investment contribute to growth—
technology and skill acquisition, and growth takes two forms—TFP and variety growth. The rate
of TFP growth depends more heavily on the parameters governing skill accumulation, while
variety growth depends, roughly, on the difference between the parameters governing technology
and skill accumulation. Conditions for the existence of a BGP are established, and the effects of
various parameters are characterized. In an example, subsidies to skill acquisition (technology
acquisition) are powerful tools for stimulating TFP growth (variety growth). Investment
incentives off the BGP are also explored.

1. INTRODUCTION
This paper develops a model in which two factors contribute to growth: investments
in technology by heterogeneous rms and investments in human capital by heterogeneous workers. Income growth in turn takes two forms: growth in the quantity
produced of each di erentiated good and growth in the number of goods available.
Call these two forms total factor productivity (TFP) growth and variety growth.
Both types of investment a ect both forms of growth, but the contributions are
not symmetric. Improvements in the parameters governing investment in skill raise
the rate of TFP growth and reduce the rate of variety growth. Improvements in the
parameters governing investment in technology raise the rate of variety growth, while
the e ect on TFP growth is positive, zero, or negative as the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution (EIS) is greater than, equal to or less than unity.
This asymmetry appears despite the fact that skill and technology are modeled as
symmetric in many respects, and on balanced growth paths (BGPs) the rate of TFP
growth is also the (common) growth rate of technology and human capital. But the
factors are fundamentally di erent in two respects. First, human capital is a rival
input while technology is nonrival. That is, an increase in a worker's human capital
a ects only his own productivity, while an improvement in a rm's technology can
be exploited by all its workers.
In addition, the two factors di er in the way entry occurs. Growth in the size of
the workforce is exogenous. Entry by new rms is endogenous, and entering rms
must invest to obtain technologies for new goods. Thus, the expected pro tability of
a new product a ects the incentives of entrants, and the entry rate is governed by a
zero-pro t condition.
Analyzing both types of investment together is important because there is strategic
complementarity in the incentives to invest. Incumbent workers invest in skill to

2

increase their wages. But without continued improvement in the set of technologies
used by rms, the returns to workers' investments would decline and, eventually, be
too small to justify further investment. Similarly, incumbent rms invest in better
technologies to increase their pro ts, but without continued improvement in the skill
distribution of the workforce, their returns would eventually be too small to justify
further investments. Sustained growth requires continued investment in both factors,
and the contribution of this paper is to characterize the interplay between the two
types of investment. It also suggests why empirical work based on regression analysis
is likely to fail: if two factors are highly complementary, a linear framework will have
diculty picking up their e ects.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related literature is discussed in
section 2. Section 3 sets out the production technologies and characterizes the (static)
production equilibrium. The production function for di erentiated intermediates has
two inputs, technology and human capital, and it is log-supermodular. Hence the
competitive equilibrium features positively assortative matching between technology
and skill. Proposition 1 establishes the existence, uniqueness and eciency of a
production equilibrium, describing the allocation of labor across technologies and
the resulting prices, wages, output levels, and pro ts. Lemmas 2 and 3 establish
some homogeneity properties. The rst main result, Proposition 4, shows that if the
technology and skill distributions are Pareto, with locations that are appropriately
aligned, then the equilibrium allocation of skill to technology is linear, and the wage,
price, output, and pro t functions are isoelastic.
Section 4 treats dynamics: the investment decisions of incumbent rms, new entrants, and workers; the evolution of the technology and skill distributions; and the
interest rate and consumption growth. Section 5 provides formal de nitions of a competitive equilibrium and a balanced growth path. A balanced growth path features
stationary, nondegenerate distributions of relative technology and relative human
3

capital, with both growing at a common, constant rate.
Section 6 specializes to the case where technology and skill have Pareto distributions, showing that the isoelastic forms for the pro t and wage functions are inherited
by the value functions for producers and workers. This fact leads to a tractable set of
conditions describing investment and the evolution of the technology and skill distributions on a BGP. The second main result, Proposition 5, provides conditions that
ensure the existence of a BGP.
Section 7 looks at the e ects of various parameters and policies. Proposition 6,
the third main result, describes the e ects of parameter changes on TFP and variety
growth. Because investments of both types have important positive external e ects,
the competitive equilibrium investment rates are presumably too low, and the effects of subsidies to investment are described in Corollary 1. In a roughly calibrated
example, such subsidies are very powerful.
Section 8 examines the incentives to invest o the BGP. Proposition 8 shows, in a
simple setting, that the incentive increases (decreases) for the lagging (leading) factor,
suggesting that growth in one factor alone cannot be sustained in the long run.
Section 9 concludes. Proofs and technical derivations and arguments are gathered
in Appendices.
2. RELATED LITERATURE
This paper is related to two literatures: on di usion of ideas/technologies and on
technology-skill complementarity. Each has both theoretical and empirical components.
The idea that technology di usion is an important factor for growth has a long
history, and in an early contribution Nelson and Phelps (1966) emphasize the role
of educated labor in facilitating such di usion. Jovanovic and Rob (1989) look at
an aggregate model with heterogeneous agents, where meetings between agents can
4

generate both new ideas and imitation|di usion of an idea from the initially more
productive agent to one that is less productive. Jovanovic and MacDonald (1994)
look at innovation and di usion in a competitive industry, where rm-level incentives
are in uenced by the distribution of technologies across their rivals.
Kortum (1997) introduces the notion of a technology frontier as a description of the
state of knowledge in a society, and Lucas (2009, 2015) develops models where that
frontier evolves as a consequence of meetings between agents that result in the transfer
of knowledge. Lucas and Moll (2014) extend those models to allow agents to divide
their available time between production and knowledge acquisition, and Caicedo,
Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2016) embed idea di usion into a model of hierarchies.
Benhabib, Perla, and Tonetti (2017) analyze a model with innovation as well as
di usion. Models of learning by doing at the rm, industry, or society level, as in
Arrow (1962), Stokey (1988), and Bahk and Gort (1993) can also be interpreted as a
type of di usion.
There is also an extensive literature looking at the di usion of technologies or ideas
across international boundaries as engines of growth, including Eaton and Kortum
(1999), Parente and Prescott (1999), Alvarez, Buera and Lucas (2014), Perla, Tonetti
and Waugh (2015), Stokey (2015), Buera and Ober eld (2017). See Buera and Lucas
(2017) for a description of some of the key models of technology di usion.
The model here is most closely related to Perla and Tonetti (2014). Indeed, the
investment model used here, separately for workers and

rms, is exactly the one

developed there, where the single type of agent can equally well be interpreted as a
rm or a worker. The change here is to introduce a production function that uses
both inputs and displays complementarity.
Empirical studies of technology di usion have taken several approaches, looking at
geographic di usion within a country, di usion across rms within an industry, and
cross-country di usion. Geographic di usion of agricultural innovations, where inputs
5

and outputs are easily measured, include Griliches' (1957) early study of hybrid corn
in the U.S., and Foster and Rosenzweig's studies of the introduction of high yielding
varieties in India during the green revolution (1996) and of adoption in a broader
set of countries (2010). In both cases they nd that schooling is an important factor
in explaining di erences. Manuelli and Seshadri (2014) look at the slow di usion
of tractors in U.S. agriculture, while Allen, Bilir, and Tonetti (2017) look at the
geographic di usion of prescriptions for statins across physicians in the U.S.
Mans eld (1961) looks at the di usion of twelve major innovations across large rms
in four industries, nding wide variation in the speed of adoption, much of which can
be explained by the pro tability of the innovation and the cost of adoption. Gort
and Klepper (1982) look at the di usion of 46 new products through entry and exit
of producers, identifying various stages in the product life-cycle that include an early
period of rapid entry and a later period of substantial net exit.
Comin and Hobijn look at cross-country di usion for speci c technologies over two
centuries, in 23 industrial economies (2004) and in 166 countries covering the full
range of income levels (2010). In the former they

nd that human capital is an

important factor in uencing speed of adoption. In Comin and Hobijn (2017) they
build on the latter, looking at adoption lags and intensity of use. They conclude
that di erences in adoption lags account for much of the cross-country divergence in
incomes during the nineteenth century, while di erences in intensity of use account
for further divergence in the twentieth century.
Since many new technologies are `embodied' in new capital goods, technologyskill and capital-skill complementarity are to a large extent two labels for the same
phenomenon, dicult to distinguish either conceptually or empirically. Griliches
(1969) introduced the notion of capital-skill complementarity in a three-input demand
model with capital and two types of labor, and found evidence in its favor in crossindustry U.S. data. Since then the idea has been incorporated into many types of
6

models, including models of long run growth.1 Some of these drop the physical capital
component, looking at technology-skill complementarity, and some retain it, often in
the form of vintage capital.
Jovanovic and Nyarko (1996) explore a single-agent model of learning-by-doing
and technology choice, where the agent switches to better technologies as her skill
improves, while Greenwood and Yorokoglu (1997) investigate the hypothesis that
adoption of new technologies requires signi cant learning, and that skilled workers
facilitate that learning. They nd evidence going back to the period of the Industrial
Revolution that supports this idea. Caselli (1999) studies a vintage capital model
with overlapping generations, looking at the adoption of a single new technology
that is more productive but requires more training for workers. In his model use
of the new technology increases gradually. If it is a suciently large improvement,
the new technique eventually displaces the old one, but only in the long run. In a
similar vein Jovanovic (2009) looks at the spread of technology in a frictionless market
with heterogenous labor, where low-skill agents may prefer to use older technologies
because they are less expensive.
Acemoglu (1998) suggests that reverse causation may also play a role, as over time
newer technologies are designed to complement the rising skills of the workforce. See
Acemoglu (2002) for a more comprehensive discussion of the extensive literature on
1

In other applications, capital-skill complementarity has been used by Stokey (1996) to analyze

the wage e ects of lowering trade barriers between countries with di erent aggregate input mixes;
by Krusell et al. (2000) in a dynamic model with investment-speci c technical change to explain
the increasing skill premium; and by Costinot and Vogel (2010) and Stokey (2016) in static models
to look at the general equilibrium wage e ects of various types of technical changes. Labeled as
skill-biased technical change, it has also been o ered as the main source of the rising skill premium
in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's, as in Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1994); Dunne, Haltiwanger,
and Troske (1996); Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2002), Violante (2002), and Autor, Levy and
Murnane (2003)).

skill-biased technical change.
Nelson, et. al. (1967) suggest that the educational requirement of a technology
declines as the technology ages, emphasizing the role of high-skill labor in di usion.
The idea is that experience|transferable learning-by-doing|allows substitution toward less skilled workers. Thus, short-run and long-run e ects may di er. Nevertheless, sectors with faster rates of technical change should employ relatively more
highly educated labor, an implication that has been studied empirically.
Bartel and Lichtenberg (1987) examine it using cross-industry data for 61 U.S.
manufacturing industries in 1960, 1970, 1980. They nd that the share of labor cost
accounted for by workers with more than a high school education declines with the
average age of the equipment in that industry. Doms, Dunne and Troske (1997) nd in
cross-section that high-tech plants employ more skilled workers, and in time series that
plants with more skilled workers are more likely to adopt new technologies. Bartel,
Ichniowski and Shaw (2007) nd that adoption of IT-enhanced capital equipment is
associated with increases in skill requirements for the operators of that equipment.
Goldin and Katz (1998) report evidence of capital-skill and technology-skill complementarity in manufacturing in the U.S. in the early nineteenth century, where they
were related to the adoption of electric motors and to the transition from artisanal
shops to factories and assembly lines.
More recently, two particular innovations have been examined for evidence of
technology-skill complementarity, computers and internet access. Studies of the former have used cross-industry data as in Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) and Beaudry,
Doms, and Lewis (2010) for the U.S. and Machin and Van Reenen (1998) for seven
OECD countries. Internet access has been studied using geographic variation, as in
Forman et al. (2012) looking at county-level U.S. data, and Akerman et al. (2015)
using data from a broadband rollout in Norway. All nd evidence of technology-skill
complementarity.
8

Only a few papers to date look at multiple engines of growth, all focusing on
skill and technology as the two factors. In an early contribution, Jovanovic (1998)
develops a vintage capital model, where later vintages are more productive, workers
are heterogeneous in terms of skill, and each worker is assigned to one machine.
The model of long-run growth in Lloyd-Ellis and Roberts (2002) features overlapping generations, who acquire skill to implement and invent new technologies. Like
the model here, it features complementarity between investments in skill and technology. But those investments are modeled as schooling and R&D decisions, in contrast
to the di usion model here.
The model in Stokey (2018) is similar in many respects to the one here. The
main di erence is the way investments in technical change and human capital are
treated. There, rms have technologies that evolve as geometric Brownian motions,
as in Luttmer (2007), and the rm's investment rate controls the drift of the process.
Workers' skills evolve in the same way, with an investment decision controlling the
drift. Fairly strong joint restrictions on the investment cost functions are needed to
obtain existence a balanced growth path.
Goldin and Katz (2008) provide a comprehensive review of the evidence on the
co-evolution of education and technology in the U.S. over the twentieth century.
3. PRODUCTION AND PRICES
The single nal good is produced by competitive rms using intermediate goods as
inputs. Intermediate goods are produced by heterogeneous, monopolistically competitive rms. Each intermediate rm produces a unique variety, and all intermediates
enter symmetrically into nal good production. But intermediate rms di er in their
technology level x; which a ects their productivity. Let Np be the number (mass) of
intermediate good producers, and let F (x); with with continuous density f , denote
the distribution function for technology.
9

Intermediate good producers use heterogeneous labor, di erentiated by its human
capital level h; as the only input. Let Lw ; be the size of the workforce, and let
with continuous density

(h);

; denote the distribution function for human capital. This

section looks at the the allocation of labor across producers, and wages, prices, output
levels, and pro ts, given Np ; F; Lw ; :

The output of a rm depends on the size and quality of its workforce, as well as
its technology. In particular, if a producer with technology x employs ` workers with

The elasticity of substitution between technology and human capital is assumed to
be less than unity,  < 1. Firms could employ workers with di erent human capital
10

levels, and in this case their outputs would simply be summed. In equilibrium rms
never choose to do so, however, and for simplicity the notation is not introduced.
B. Intermediate goods: price, output, labor
Let w(h) denote the wage function. For a

rm with technology x; the cost of

producing a unit of output with labor of quality h is w(h)=(h; x): Optimal labor
quality h (x) minimizes this expression, so h satis es
w0 (h )
h (h ; x)
=
:
w(h )
(h ; x)

(4)

It is straightforward to show that if the (local, necessary) second order condition for
cost minimization holds, then  < 1 implies h is strictly increasing in x. The labor
market is competitive, and since the production function in (3) is log-supermodular,
eciency requires positively assortative matching (Costinot, 2009).
Unit cost
c(x) =

w(h (x))

(h (x); x)

is strictly decreasing in x;
c0 (x)
=
c(x)

x (h (x); x)
< 0:
(h (x); x)

As usual, pro t maximization by intermediate good producers entails setting a
price that is a markup of = (

1) over unit cost. Output is then determined by

demand, and labor input by the production function. Hence price, quantity, labor
input, and operating pro ts for the intermediate rm are

have lower prices, higher sales, and higher pro ts. They may or may not employ

C. Production equilibrium
At any instant, the economy is described by its production parameters, the number
of rms and workers, and the distributions of technology and skill.
Definition: A production environment Ep is described by
i. parameters (; ; !; ) ; with  > 1;  2 (0; 1=]; ! 2 (0; 1) ;  2 (0; 1) ;
ii. numbers of producers and workers Np > 0 and Lw > 0;
iii. distribution functions F (x) with continuous density f (x) and lower bound
xm  0 on its support, and

(h) with continuous density

(h) and lower bound

hm  0 on its support.
A production equilibrium consists of price functions and an allocation that satisfy
pro t maximization and labor market clearing.
Definition: Given a production environment Ep ; the prices w(h); p(x); and allocation h (x); y(x), `(x); (x); yF ; are a production equilibrium if (2) and (4)-(7)
hold.
The following result is then straightforward.
Proposition 1: For any production environment Ep ; an equilibrium exists, and
12

it is unique and ecient.
D. Homogeneity properties
The analysis of BGPs will exploit the fact that production equilibria have certain homogeneity properties. Lemma 2 deals with proportionate shifts in the two
distribution functions.
Lemma 2: Fix Ep ; and let EpA be a production environment with the same parameters (; ; !; ) and numbers Np ; Lw , but with distribution functions FA ;

hA (X) = Qh (X=Q);

yA (X) = Qy(X=Q);

Price and employment for any rm depend only on its relative technology x = X=Q,
while its labor quality, output, and pro ts are scaled by Q: Wages and nal output
are also scaled by Q:

A change in Lw leads to proportionate changes in employment, output and pro ts
at each rm and in nal output, with wages, prices and the allocation of skill to
technology una ected.
An increase in Np leads to proportionate decreases in employment and output at
each rm. Final output, the price of each intermediate, and all wage rates change
with an elasticity of

 0: Thus, all increase if variety is valued, if

are unchanged if it is not, if

> 0; and all

= 0:

Pro ts per rm|which re ect both the increase in price and decrease in scale|
can change in either direction. If

> 1; then the love of variety is strong enough

so that an increase in the number of producers actually increases the pro t of each
incumbent. This case occurs only if  < 2 and, in addition, the parameter  is not
too large. In the analysis of BGPs we will impose the restriction   2; to rule out
this case.
E. Pareto distributions
In this section we will show that if the distribution functions F and

are Pareto,

with shape parameters that are not too di erent and location parameters that are
appropriately aligned, the production equilibrium has a linear assignment of skill to
14

technology, and wage, price, and pro t functions that are isoelastic.

4. DYNAMICS
In this section the dynamic aspects of the model are described: investment decisions
of incumbent producers and workers, the entry decisions of new rms, the evolution
of the distribution functions for technology and skill, and the consumption/saving
decisions of households. As in Perla and Tonetti (2014) investment is imitative, and
it is a zero-one decision. The Pareto shape for the technology and skill distributions
this investment technology requires for balanced growth ts well with the production
environment here.
It is useful to start with a brief overview. Time is continuous and the horizon
is in nite. At any date t  0; there are three groups of rms: producers, process
innovators and product innovators. A producer can at any time abandon its current
technology and become a process innovator, attempting to acquire a new technology.
The only cost is the opportunity cost: process innovators do not produce. Success is
stochastic, with a xed hazard rate, and conditional on success the process innovator
receives a technology that is a random draw from those of current producers. Hence
producers become process innovators if and only if their technology lies below an
endogenously determined threshold.
New rms, product innovators, arrive at an endogenously determined rate. Each
entrant chooses a one-time (sunk) investment level, which determines its hazard rate
for success. After paying the sunk cost, product innovators are like process innovators
except that their hazard rate is di erent.
Similarly, at any date the labor force has three groups: workers, retoolers and
trainees. A worker can at any time become a retooler, attempting to acquire a new
skill, and the only cost is an opportunity cost|retoolers do not work. Success is
stochastic, with a xed hazard rate, and conditional on success the retooler receives
a skill that is a random draw from those of current workers. Hence workers become

17

retoolers if and only if their skill lies below an endogenously determined threshold.
The workforce grows at an exogenously xed rate : New entrants, trainees, are
like retoolers except that their hazard rate for success may be di erent.
Note that there is an important asymmetry between rms and workers: the workforce grows at an exogenously xed rate, while entry by new rms is endogenous,
satisfying a free entry condition.
At date t, Np (t); Ni (t); Ne (t) are the numbers of producers, process innovators, and
product innovators, with sum N (t); Lw (t); Li (t); Le (t) are the numbers of workers,
retoolers, and entrants, with sum L(t); F (X; t);

(H; t) are the distribution functions

for technology among producers and skill among workers; W (H; t); H  (X; t); P (X; t);
Y (X; t); L(X; t); (X; t); YF (t); t  0; are the wage function, skill allocation, and so
on; and r(t) is the interest rate. Note that only producers and workers are identi ed
by a technology or skill level.
A. Firms: process and product innovation
Let V f (X; t) denote the value of a producer with technology X at date t: A rm
that chooses to become a process innovator abandons its current technology and
waits to acquire a new one. A process innovator pays no direct costs: there is only
the opportunity cost of forgone pro ts. Abandoned technologies cannot be reclaimed,
so all process innovators at date t are in the same position. Let Vf i (t) denote their
(common) value.
Success is stochastic, arriving at rate xi ; and conditional on success at date t, the
innovator gets a new technology that is random draw from the distribution F (; t)
among current producers. Hence Vf i (t) satis es the Bellman equation

[r(t) + x ] Vf i (t) = xi EF (;t) [V f (X; t)]

Vf i (t) + Vf0i (t);

all t;

where the term in braces is the expected gain in value conditional on success, r(t) is
18

the interest rate, and x  0 is an exogenous exit rate.
The value V f (X; t) of a producer is the expected discounted value of its future pro t
ows. Clearly V f is nondecreasing in its rst argument: a better technology can only
raise the rm's value. Hence at any date t, producers with technologies below some
threshold Xm (t) become process innovators, while those with technologies above the
threshold continue to produce. It follows that at date t; the value of a producer with
technology X is Vf i (t) if X  Xm (t); and the irreversibility of investment means that
Xm (t) is nondecreasing. While a rm produces, its technology X grows (or declines)
at a constant rate x : Hence the value V f (X; t) of a producer, a rm with X > Xm (t);
satis es the Bellman equation2
[r(t) + x ] V f (X; t) =  (X; t) + x XVXf (X; t) + Vtf (X; t);

all t:

Value matching provides a boundary condition for this ODE, and the optimal choice
about when to invest implies that smooth pasting holds. Hence
V f [Xm (t); t] = Vf i (t);
VXf [Xm (t); t] = 0;

all t:

Entering rms|product innovators|have a similar investment technology, except
that they make a one-time (sunk) investment Ie : The success rate of an innovator
depends on his own investment Ie relative to the average spending I e of others in his
cohort, scaled by the ratio of new entrants to existing products. In particular, let
2

At this stage, it would be easy to assume that the technology X of an incumbent evolves

as a geometric Brownian motion. The cross-sectional distribution of technologies among initially
identical

rms, within each age cohort, would be lognormal, with a growing variance, and the

overall distribution would be a mixture of lognormals. When the solution to the model is actually
characterized in section 6, however, the argument relies on technologies across incumbents having
a Pareto distribution. At that point the mixture of lognormals would be incompatible with the
requirement of a Pareto distribution overall, and the variance term would have to be dropped.

and is willing to enter if and only if the maximized value is nonnegative. Since xe
diverges as  ! 0; in equilibrium there is positive entry at all dates, E(t) > 0. All
entering rms choose the same investment level, and their common success rate is
xe (t) = e =(t). Free entry, together with the form of the function xe ; imply that
their common expenditure level is bid up to exhaust pro ts,
Ie (t) = Vf e (t; xe (t));

all t;

and aggregate spending by entrants at t is E(t)Ie (t):
B. Workers: investment in human capital
Workers invest to maximize the expected discounted value of their lifetime earnings.
An individual who chooses to invest|a retooler|stops working, abandons his old skill
20

and waits to acquire a new one. Let V w (H; t) denote the value of a worker with skill
H at date t, and let Vwi (t) denote the value of a retooler.
Success for retoolers is stochastic, arriving at rate hi > 0; and conditional on
success at date t, the individual gets a skill level drawn from the distribution

(; t)

across current workers. Hence Vwi (t) satis es the Bellman equation

[r(t) + h ] Vwi (t) = hi E

(;t) [V

(H; t)]

Vwi (t) + Vwi
(t);

all t;

where the term in braces is the expected gain in value conditional on success, and
h  0 is an exogenous exit rate.
Clearly V w (H; t) is nondecreasing in its rst argument: higher human capital can
only raise the worker's expected lifetime income. Hence at any date t; all individuals
with skill below some threshold Hm (t) become retoolers, while those with skill above
the threshold continue working. It follows that at date t; the value of a worker with
skill H  Hm (t) is Vwi (t); and the irreversibility of investment implies that Hm (t) is
nondecreasing.
While an individual works, his human capital H grows (or declines) at a constant
rate h ; which can be interpreted as on-the-job learning. Hence the value V w (H; t)
for a worker with skill H > Hm (t); satis es the Bellman equation
[r(t) + h ] V w (H; t) = W (H; t) + h HVHw (H; t) + Vtw (H; t);

all t:

As for rms, value matching and smooth pasting hold at the threshold Hm (t); so
V w [Hm (t); t] = Vwi (t);
VHw [Hm (t); t] = 0;

all t:

New entrants into the workforce|trainees, have an investment technology like the
one for retoolers, except that their hazard rate for success, call it he ; may be di erent.
They pay no costs, so their value function Vwe (t) satis es the Bellman equation

C. The evolution of technology and skill
Next consider the evolution of the group sizes (Np ; Ni ; Ne ) and (Lw ; Li ; Le ) and the
distribution functions F and

:

The number of producers Np (t) grows because of success by innovators of both
types, and declines because of exit and decisions to switch to process innovation.
The producers that switch to innovating around date t are those with technologies
X(t) that are close enough to the threshold Xm (t) so that growth in that threshold
overtakes them. Since technologies for producers grow at the rate x ; there is a
positive level of switching at date t if and only if

while the number of product innovators Ne grows because new entrants join. Each
declines because of exit and success, so

(x + xe ) Ne (t);

(x + xi ) Ni (t);
all t:

The distribution function F for technology among producers evolves because their
technologies grow at rate x ; they exit at the rate x ; innovators of both types succeed,
and rms at the threshold Xm (t) switch to process innovations. As shown in the

D. Consumption
Individuals are organized into a continuum of identical, in nitely lived households
of total mass one, where each dynastic household comprises a representative crosssection of the population. New entrants to the workforce arrive at the xed rate h +;
so each household grows in size at the constant rate   0; and total population at
date t is L(t) = L0 et :
23

Members of the household pool their earnings and they own the pro t streams from
rms. The investment decisions of rms and workers, both incumbents and entrants,
maximize, respectively, the expected discounted value of net pro ts and wages. Hence
there are no further investment decisions at the household level. Since there is no
aggregate uncertainty, the household faces no consumption risk.
The household's income consists of the wages of its workers plus the pro ts from
its portfolio, which sum to output of the nal good,
YF (t) = Lw (t)E

(;t)

[W (H; t)] + Np (t)EF (;t) [(X; t)] ;

That income is used for consumption and to nance the investment (entry) costs of

5. COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIA, BGPS
This section provides formal de nitions of a competitive equilibrium and a BGP.
We start with the de nition of a (dynamic) economy.
Definition: An economy E is described by
i. parameters (; ; !; ; ; r^; ) ; with  > 1;  2 (0; 1=]; ! 2 (0; 1) ;  2 (0; 1) ;
 > 0; r^ > 0;   0;
ii. parameters j  0; ji > 0 and j ; for j = h; x; and he > 0;

v. initial distribution functions F0 (X) with continuous density f0 (X) and lower
bound Xm0 on its support, and

0 (H)

with continuous density

0 (H)

and

lower bound Hm0  0 on its support.
A. Competitive equilibrium
The de nition of a competitive equilibrium is standard.
Definition: A competitive equilibrium of an economy E consists of the following,
for all t  0:
a. the numbers of producers, process innovators, product innovators, workers,
retoolers, and trainees, [Np (t); Ni (t); Ne (t); Lw (t); Li (t); Le (t)] ; and the in ow rate
E(t) of product innovators;
b. distribution functions F (X; t); (H; t);
c. prices and allocations [W (H; t); P (X; t); H  (X; t); Y (X; t); L(X; t); (X; t); YF (t)] ;

d. value functions V f (X; t); Vf i (t) for producers and process innovators and an

investment threshold Xm (t); and a value function Vf e (t; ); investment level Ie (t);
success rate, xe (t) for product innovators;

e. value functions [V w (H; t); Vwi (t); Vwe (t)] ; for each workers, retooler, and trainees,
and an investment threshold Hm (t) for retoolers;
f. per capita consumption c(t); and the interest rate r(t);
such that for all t  0;
i. [W; P; H  ; Y; L; ; YF ] ; is a production equilibrium, given [Np ; Lw ; F; ] ;


ii. V f ; Xm solve the investment problem of producers, given [r; ; Vf i ] ; Vf i and


Vf e are consistent with r; V f ; F ; Ie satis es the optimization and entry conditions;

and the success rate for product innovators is xe = xe (1; E=Np );

iii. [V w ; Hm ] solve the investment problem of workers, given [r; W; Vwi ] ; and [Vwi ; Vwe ]
are consistent with [r; V w ; ] ;
iii. [Np ; Ni ; Ne ; F ] are consistent with [Xm ; E] ; and the initial conditions [Np0 ; Ni0 ; Ne0 ; F0 ] ;
and Xm (0) = Xm0 ;
v. [Lw ; Li ; Le ; ] are consistent with Hm and the initial conditions [Lw0 ; Li0 ; Le0 ;

0] ;

and Hm (0) = Hm0 ;
vi. c solves the consumption/savings problem of households, given [r; YF

EIe ] ;

and
vii. the goods market clears.
B. Balanced growth
The rest of the analysis focuses on balanced growth paths, competitive equilibria
with the property that quantities grow at constant rates, and the normalized distributions of technology and skill are time invariant.
Let Q(t)  EF (;t) (X) ; t  0; denote average technology at date t. On a BGP
Q grows at a constant rate, call it g; and the distributions of relative technology
26

x = X=Q(t) and relative human capital h = H=Q(t) are constant. By assumption
total population L grows at the xed rate : On a BGP the number of rms N also
grows at a constant rate, call it n; and the shares of rms and individuals in each
category, [Np =N; Ni =N; Ne =N ] and [Lw =L; Li =L; Le =L] are constant. The growth rates
g and n are endogenous.
It follows from Lemma 2 that on a BGP the labor allocation in terms of relative
technology and relative skill is time invariant. The growth rates for wages, prices,
output levels, and so on are then described by Lemma 3, where

; de ned in (8),

measures the impact of variety growth. In particular, average product price grows
at rate

n; average output per rm at rate g + 

rm at rate 

n; and average employment per

n: Output per capita (wages), aggregate output, and pro ts per rm,

grow at rates
gw = g + n;

gY = gw + ;

g = gY

Total investment costs Eie EF []; also grow at rate gY : If

n:

(21)

> 1; then love of variety

is so strong that an increase in the number of producers actually raises the pro ts
of each incumbent. In a dynamic model with free entry, this feature poses obvious
problems. In the rest of the analysis we will assume that   2, which implies

< 1:

These observations lead to the following de nition.
Definition: A competitive equilibrium for E is a balanced growth path (BGP) if
for some g > 0 and n; with gY ; gw and g as in (21), the equilibrium has the property
that for all t  0:

The rest of the analysis focusses on a class of

economies for which BGPs exist, and studies the determinants of the growth rates g
and n of TFP and variety
6. CONDITIONS FOR BALANCED GROWTH
In this section we will show that if an economy E has initial distribution functions
F0 and

0

that are Pareto, with shape and location parameters that satisfy the

requirements of Proposition 4, then the normalized value functions vf p (x) and vw (h)
29

for producers and workers inherit the isoelastic forms of the normalized pro t and
wage functions, and simple closed form solutions can be found. Moreover, the growth
rates g and n, as well as other features of the BGP, can be solved for explicitly. The
arguments are summarized in Proposition 5, which provides sucient conditions for
existence and uniqueness of a BGP.
A. Production equilibrium
Suppose the initial distributions F0 and
and (

h ; Hm0 ) :

0

are Pareto, with parameters (

x ; Xm0 )

Assume (9) holds, de ne ";  and ah by (10)-(12), and assume that

Hm0 = ah Xm0 : Average technology under the initial distribution is

Use Q0 to de ne the normalized distribution functions

Hence the hypotheses of Proposition 4 hold for F^ ; ^ ; and given Np0 ; Lw0 ; (14)-(17)
describe the production equilibrium [w; p; h ; y; `; ; yF ] :
B. Firms, investment in technology
Next we will characterize the normalized value functions [vf p (x); vf i ; vf e0 ] and investment cost ie0 for entrants as functions of (g; n) ; and derive one additional equation relating (g; n) : Recall that a BGP requires positive process innovation, which in
30

turn requires g > x ; so that the investment threshold grows faster than producers'
technologies. We will assume that this condition holds.
Consider the investment decision and value of a producer. As shown in the Appendix, if  and V f have the forms required for a BGP, and (x) has the isoelastic form
in Proposition 4, then the normalized value function vf p (x) for a producer satis es
(r

g + x ) vf p (x) = 2 (x=xm )1



(g

x ) xvf0 p (x);

x  xm ;

where 2 is as de ned in (18), with Lw = Lw0 and Np = Np0 : This equation is a rstorder ODE. Value matching provides a boundary condition, yielding the solution
vf p (x) = 2 Bx (x=xm )1



2 Bx ) (x=xm )Rx ;

+ (vf i

x  xm ;

(25)

where the constant Bx > 0 and characteristic root Rx < 0 are known functions of the
parameters. The rst term in (25) is the value of a producer who operates forever,
never investing. The second term represents the additional value from the option to
invest in process innovation. The smooth pasting condition


vf i = 2 Bx 1
Rx

;
=
r g + x

(26)

determines vf i , the normalized value of a process innovator, from the optimal choice
of the investment threshold by a producer switching to process innovation.
But from the perspective of a rm that has already switched and is waiting for a new
technology, its value vf i is the expected discounted value across current producers,
adjusted for exit, growth, and waiting time. That is, on a BGP vf i also satis es
g + x ) vf i = xi fEF^ [vf p (x)]

(r

vf i g :

To simplify this condition, substitute for EF^ [vf p (x)] and vf i from (25) and (26) and
factor out 2 Bx to get
r

g + x =

(

Rx (1 ) xi

1 + ) ( x Rx )
31

(27)

Since r; g and Rx involve g and n; while all of the other parameters in this expression

equation for process innovators places on the ratio EF^ [vf p (x)] =vf i :
For any success rate ; on a BGP the normalized value vf e () of a product innovator, gross of the sunk cost, satis es
(r

g + x + ) vf e () = EF^ [vf p (x)] ;

(28)

which determines the function vf e : The ow of new entrants is determined by the
rate of variety growth, E = (n + x ) N; so the entry rate is  = (n + x ) N=Np : As
shown below, the ratio N=Np is constant on a BGP, so the entry rate  > 0 is also
constant. In any equilibrium ie =ie = 1; so the success rate for product innovators is
also constant,
xe0 = xe (1; ) = e = > 0:
From (28), the value of an entrant is then
vf e0 =

(29)

and expected pro ts just cover entry costs if
ie0 = vf e0 :

(30)

We must also check the incentive to invest. Given the function vf e () in (28), the
entry rate ; and the average investment ie of others in its cohort, the normalized
problem of a product innovator is

max vf e [xe (ie =ie ; )]

The argument for the labor force is analogous except that the entry rate of trainees

where the constant Bh > 0 and characteristic root Rh < 0 are known functions of the
parameters. The rst term in (32) is the value of a worker who never invests, and
the second represents the additional value from the option to retool. The value of a

D. Flows of

rms and workers, the evolution of technology and skill

On a BGP the number of rms grows at a constant rate n; and the shares of rms
engaged in production and the two kinds of innovation are constant. Hence the ow
of new entrants at any date is
E = (n + x ) N;

(36)

and the entry rate is constant,

It is easy to check that if Xm and Hm grow at rate g; as required on a BGP, then
the distribution functions F (; t) and

E. Consumption, the interest rate
On a BGP per capita consumption grows at the rate gw ; so the interest rate is
r = r^ + gw :

(40)

Aggregate income grows at the rate gY ; so its present discounted value is nite if and
only if r > gY ; or
r^ > gY

F. Existence of BGPs
The growth rates (g; n) are determined by (27) and (34). Substituting for gw ; g ; r;

then E has a unique competitive equilibrium that is a BGP.
7. GROWTH RATES ON THE BGP
In this section we will examine the e ect of various parameters on the growth rates
g and n: We will also look at subsidy policies that increase growth and provide a
roughly calibrated numerical example. In the example, subsidies to retooling have a
powerful e ect on growth.
A. Growth rates
If preferences are logarithmic,  = 1; or if

= 0; so variety is not valued, then

Wn = 0 and the rst equation in (42), by itself, determines g: Thus g is a weighted
sum of the skill parameters h ; hi ; h ; and the rate of time preference r^, and the
technology parameters x ; xi ; x ; do not enter. Faster on-the-job skill growth h
raises g; as does a higher success rate hi for retoolers. A higher exit rate h or

36

discount rate r^ reduces g: If  > 1 and

> 0; then TFP growth has a downward

adjustment for variety growth.
From the second equation in (42), the rate of variety growth n increases one-for-one
with population growth, with adjustments for di erences in the parameters governing
technology and skill acquisition. As noted in section 4, data on the distribution of
rm or establishment size by employment suggests

x

>

h:

In this case h

x < 0;

so variety growth is adjusted downward for TFP growth.
Proposition 6 has a precise summary of the comparative statics results.
Proposition 6: Let E be as in Proposition 5. Then
a. an increase in h ; hi or a decrease in h raises g and reduces n;
b. an increase in ; x ; xi or a decrease in x raises n; and
|raises g if (

1)

< 0;

|has no e ect on g if (
|reduces g if (

1)

1)

= 0; and

> 0;

c. a decrease in r^ raises g if (

1)

 0; and has otherwise ambiguous e ects.

The initial population size and number rms, L0 and N0 ; do not a ect the growth
rates, although they do a ect the levels for wages, pro ts and the distribution of
employment across technologies. In particular, since Np0 and Lw0 are directly proportional to N0 and L0 ; it follows from the de nitions of w2 ; `2 ; and 2 ; that wages
are proportional to N0 ; employment is proportional to L0 : and pro ts per rm are
proportional to L0 N0

1

: Similarly, the success rates he ; xe for entrants acquiring

initial skill/productivity a ect the population shares but not the growth rate.
B. Policies to increase growth
Investments by incumbent producers and workers have positive external e ects,
since they improve the pools from which later investors|both incumbents and entrants|
37

draw their technologies and skills. Hence investment is below the ecient level, as in
Perla and Tonetti (2014, Propositions 3 and 4). Subsidies to investment are obvious
policies to overcome this ineciency.
A complete analysis of optimal policies, which would require characterizing the
transition path between old and new BGPs, is beyond the scope of this paper. But
it is easy to assess the e ect of subsidies on long-run growth rates.
Consider subsidies to process innovators and retoolers at constant rates x and h ;
scaled by the wage/pro t ow of the the marginal producer/worker. Under such a
policy the normalized Bellman equations for process innovators and retoolers are
(r
(r


g + x ) vf i = x 2 + xi EF [v f (x)]

gw + h ) vwi = h w2 + hi fE [v w (x)]

vf i ;
vwi g ;

and the constants Ax and Ah in (42) become
A^x =

1
1

x

A^h =

Ax ;

1
1

h

Ah :

Thus, subsidies increase the coecients on the hazard rates xi and hi : The next
result is then immediate.
Corollary 1: Under the hypotheses of Proposition 6, a subsidy h > 0 to retoolers raises g and reduces n; while a subsidy x > 0 to process innovators increases
n and increases, leaves unchanged, or decreases g as (

38

1)

< 0; = 0; or > 0:

C. An example
We conclude with a roughly calibrated numerical example, using data for establishments to calibrate parameters for products (technologies). In particular,

The parameters

x;

h ; ;

are chosen to roughly target the tail parameters

R;

`;

w;

for the distributions of revenue, employment and wages. Zipf's law for establishment
size, measured by either revenue or employment, suggests values not too far above
unity, while the distribution for wages is approximately log-normal, suggesting a large
value for

w:

The values for ; r^ are standard in the macro literature,  is set at the average
rate of employment growth over the period 1988-2015, x is the empirical exit rate
for rms, and h implies an average working lifetime of 33 years. The evidence for
on-the-job-training/learning-by-doing in Hansen and Imrohoroglu (2009) suggests a
high value for h : Here it is set near the upper bound imposed by Proposition 5, and
x is set at the same level.
Since there is little evidence on returns-to-variety, several values|spanning the
entire feasible range|are used for : For each value, the success rates for incumbent
39

investors hi and xi are chosen to target wage growth gw and growth n in the number
of establishments, which are set at their historical averages for the period 1988-2015.
These determine the interest rate r; aggregate output growth gY ; growth in pro ts per
establishment g ; and TFP growth g: Of these, only g varies with : The success rates
he and xe do not a ect g or n: The growth rates satisfy the inequalities required
by Proposition 5, c0 > 0; "x can be chosen so (31) holds, and the ratios Ni0 =Np0 ; etc.
can be chosen so condition (c) holds.
The model also has predictions for wage growth for individuals and growth in
revenue and employment for establishments. For either type of agent growth has two
components, continuous growth while working/producing and jumps from successful
investment. Since the jumps are hard to match with data, we will focus on age cohorts
of individuals and establishments, which display smooth growth.
Each age cohort of individuals has a mix of workers, retoolers, and entrants, with
proportions that change as the cohort ages. Among survivors at age a  0, the shares
of the three groups, w (a); r (a); he (a); are

Similarly, each age cohort of establishments has a mix of producers, process innovators, and entrants. Among survivors at age a  0; the shares of the three groups,

Figure 1 displays the demographics for the calibration with

= 0 (no love-of-

variety). Panel (a) shows the shares of survivors at each age for entering cohorts of
labor and establishments, panel (b) shows the population shares for the labor force,
and panel (c) shows the population shares for establishments. Note that there are almost no retoolers, at any age, but there is a substantial amount of process innovation.
Indeed the share of producers peaks and then declines slightly, as producers switch
to process innovation, and in the long run about a third of cohort of establishments
are investing in process innovation. The di erence in long run shares comes from the
di erence in the tail parameters for the technology and skill distributions, with the
technology distribution having a much thicker density near its lower threshold.
Only workers receive wages, and at any date, the workers in every age cohort have
average wages equal to the economy-wide average. Since average wages grow at the
rate gw ; average earnings among survivors in the cohort of age a; relative to the
average wage in the economy when they entered, are
eAv (a) = egw a w (a);

a  0:

This average grows rapidly rapidly when the cohort is young, since w grows rapidly
as entrants transition to workers. As the cohort ages, w (a) converges to a constant
and growth in average earnings slows, approaching gw as a grows without bound. The
number of survivors declines over time through exit, so total earnings for the cohort
are
eT (a) = e

h a

Av (a);

a  0;

which grows when the cohort is young and declines when it is old.
Similarly, only producers have revenue and employees, and at any date producers
in every age cohort have average revenue and employment equal to the economy-wide
averages. Since the averages grow at rates g (revenue) and 
41

n (employment), the

averages among survivors in the cohort, relative to the levels when they entered, are
RAv (a) = eg a p (a);
`Av (a) = e(

n)a

p (a);

a  0:

Both grow rapidly when the cohort is young, since p grows rapidly as entrants
transition to producers. As the cohort ages, p (a) converges to a constant, and
average revenue (employment) among survivors grows in the long run if and only if
g > 0 (revenue) or 

n > 0 (employment). The number of survivors in the cohort

declines over time as establishments exit, so cohort totals are
RT (a) = e

x a

RAv (a);

`T (a) = e

x a

`Av (a);

a  0:

Both have an inverse U-shape.
Figure 2 displays cohort earnings and employment. Figure 2a shows (log) cohort
earnings, both the average per survivor and the cohort total. In the model, \entry"
is the date at which cohort members start attempting to acquire, so at age a = 0;
there are no workers and the cohort has no earnings. To better compare the model
with data, it is useful to view a = 4 as the age when the cohort \enters." At this
point about 55% of the cohort is working. Both curves are normalized to zero at that
point. Earnings per survivor grow rapidly for a little less than a decade, and after
that more slowly. The cohort total peaks quickly and then declines, due to exit.
Figures 2b shows (log) employment for a cohort of entering establishments.3 At
age a = 4; about 71% of the cohort is producing. Average employment per survivor
grows rapidly for the next ve years. It then declines slightly while the cohort is in
middle age, and many survivors are switching from production to process innovation.
In the cohort's old age the population shares are approximately constant. Since 
3

The gure for revenue is very similar, since g and 

42

n are both very small.

n

is very small, employment per survivor is approximately constant for very old cohorts.
The cohort total starts declining almost immediately.
In the example, a modest subsidy to retooling has a large e ect on TFP growth.
Speci cally, a subsidy of 20% of the marginal worker's wage increases TFP growth
by almost one percentage point all three cases. It also reduces variety growth by 2:1
to 2:8 percentage points, depending on : The net e ect on per capita income (wage)
growth is between 0:9 and 0.5 percentage points, depending on ;

0:0278] ;

gw = [ 0:00935;

0:00755;

0:00526] :

In each case growth in pro ts per variety rises by about three percentage points,
because of faster TFP growth and slower growth in varieties.
By contrast, a subsidy to process innovation of 5% of a marginal rm's pro ts has a
zero or slightly negative e ect on TFP growth and a strong positive e ect on variety
growth. The net e ect on growth in per capita income is zero or slightly positive,
depending on ;

gw = [0:0;

In each case growth in pro ts per variety falls by close to a percentage point, a result
of the large increase in variety growth.
8. INCENTIVES OFF THE BGP
Complementarity between investments in technology and skill suggests that the
incentive for continued investment in either factor relies on continued growth in the
43

other. A complete analysis of dynamics away from the BGP is complicated, but
the incentives for the leading or lagging factor to invest can be explored in a simple
setting.
Lemma 7 provides conditions for existence of an equilibrium with no investment and
no growth. Proposition 8 then specializes to economies in which marginal agents are
just indi erent about investing, and looks at the incentives to invest in a perturbation
of that environment. It shows that the incentive increases for the lagging factor and
decreases for the leading factor.
For simplicity we consider economies where entry is impossible, xe = 0; and there
is no population growth, no exit, and no on-the-job learning ( = 0; h = x = 0;
h = x = 0): Thus, there is no growth in variety, n = 0; and both N and L are
constant over time. TFP growth, if there is any, must come from investment by
incumbents. Retooling and process innovation are possible, hi > 0 and xi > 0; but
the pools of investors are initially empty, Ni = Li = 0: Since Ne = Le = 0 as well,
Np = N and Lw = L: If there is no investment by incumbents, then the technology
and skill distributions F and

; and wages, prices, and the interest rate w; p; r; are

constant over time.
In this setting the values vh (h) and vf (x) for workers and rms are simply the
present discounted values of their wages and pro ts. If hi and xi are suciently
small, then the expected values from retooling and process innovation are less than
the values vh (hm ) and vf (xm ) of continuing to work or produce, and there is no TFP
growth: g = 0: The interest rate is then the rate of time preference, r = r^: Formally,
we have the following result.
Lemma 7: Let E be an economy with:
a. xe = 0;  = 0; h = x = 0; h = x = 0; and
b. initial conditions Ni0 = Ne0 = 0; Np0 = N; Li0 = Le0 = 0; Lw0 = L:
Let w(h); (x) denote the wage and pro t functions at t = 0; and let vh (h) = w(h)=^
r;
44

vf (x) = (x)=^
r; denote the associated value functions. If
r^vf (xm )  xi EF [vf (x)

vf (xm )] ;

r^vw (hm )  hi E [vw (h)

vw (hm )] ;

(43)

then E has a competitive equilibrium with no investment and no growth.
The two inequalities in (43) say that the rm with the worst technology and the
worker with the lowest skill prefer, at least weakly, to continue producing and working.
Hence there is an equilibrium in which the allocation and prices that prevail at t = 0
prevail at every date, and the interest rate and values are as claimed.
The next proposition uses this result, specialized in two ways. First, F and
are assumed to be Pareto distributions that satisfy the hypotheses of Proposition 4.
Thus, the wage and pro t functions are isoelastic. In addition, the two conditions in
(43) are assumed to hold with equality, so the marginal agents are indi erent about
investing.
Fix the parameters

x ; xm

for F and

h

for

. For the baseline economy suppose

the location parameter for skill is hm = ah xm ; so Proposition 4 holds, and let h (x);
w(h); vh (h); etc. denote the equilibrium skill allocation, wage function, value function
and so on in the baseline economy. For the perturbed economy suppose the skill
distribution is shifted to the right, with
^ m  hm (1 + ) ;
h

(44)

^  (x); w(h);
where  > 0 is small. Let ^ (h); h
^
v^h (h); etc. denote the distribution
function for skill, the equilibrium skill allocation, and so on in the perturbed economy.
Proposition 8 shows that if a producer with technology xm is indi erent about
investing in process innovation in the baseline economy, then it strictly prefers to
invest in the perturbed economy; and if a worker with skill hm is indi erent about
^ m strictly prefers not to
retooling in the baseline economy, then a worker with skill h
retool in the perturbed economy. Formally, we have the following result.
45

Proposition 8: Let E be an economy satisfying the hypotheses of Lemma 7.
Assume in addition that F0 ;
parameters (

x ; xm ) ;

(

0;

h ; hm )

that are Pareto distributions, with shape and location
satisfying the hypotheses of Proposition 4, and that

the two conditions in (43) hold with equality.
Let E be an economy that is the same as E except that it has distribution ^ with
^ m in (44). Let h
^  (x); w(h);
location parameter h
^
etc. denote equilibrium for E , and
^
r and v^f (x) = 
^ (x)=^
r: Then
let v^h (h) = w(h)=^
vf (x) v^f (xm )] ;
r^v^f (xm ) < xi EF [^
h
i
^ m ) > hi E ^ v^w (h) v^w (h
^ m) :
r^v^w (h

(45)

The proof involves rst-order approximations to the equilibrium allocation and prices
in the perturbed economy, so the same argument applies for a small leftward shift in
the skill distribution or for small shifts in the technology distribution.
Proposition 8 suggests that in economies where the initial skill and technology
distributions are (suciently) misaligned, there may be a period where there is investment only in the lagging factor. It also suggests that in the long run, sustained
investment in either factor requires sustained investment in its complement.
9. CONCLUSION
This paper develops a model in which investments in both technology and skill
acquisition are required for long run growth. Growth, in turn, takes two forms: TFP
growth and growth in product variety. The main results are to provide conditions for
the existence of a BGP, to show how the rates of TFP and variety growth depend
on the parameters governing technology and skill acquisition, and to show that the
incentive to invest in either factor depends on the availability of its complement.
On a BGP skill and technology grow at a common rate, which is also the rate of
TFP growth. Nevertheless, the parameters governing skill accumulation are more
46

important than those governing technological change in determining that rate. The
parameters for skill and technology enter more symmetrically|but with opposite
signs|in determining growth in product variety. Thus, improvements in the parameters for technological change encourage entry, while improvements in the parameters
for skill accumulation encourage investment in both skill and technology, but discourage growth in variety.
In a roughly calibrated numerical example, a subsidy to retooling has a large e ect
on TFP growth, and hence on growth in per capital output and consumption. The
reason for this is interesting as well: here a subsidy to retooling is powerful not
because of the direct e ect on the workers receiving the training, but rather because
it changes the distribution from which new entrants to the labor force draw their
skills. Role models are important here: they are they templates that new workers
imitate. Removing the lowest-skill role models means that young workers who would
have imitated them instead draw from skills higher in the distribution.
In equilibrium, continued investment in either factor remains worthwhile only because the other grows: the technology and skill distributions must shift together.
Although transitional dynamics are not studied in detail, an example shows that the
incentive for either factor to invest depends on the relative level of development of
its complement. In particular, if one factor has a distribution that gets `ahead' of
the other, the incentive to invest in the leading factor declines while the incentive
to invest in the lagging factor gets stronger. This result suggests that the economy
converges to a BGP for any initial distributions that are Pareto, or at least have
Pareto tails.
The model here also suggests that growth rates depend on various types of investment in a highly nonlinear way. Thus, nonparametric techniques may be more useful
than linear regression models for empirical studies of these relationships.

Then (4) and (47) are a pair of ODEs in w(h) and h (x); with `(x) given by (46). The
price normalization (2) serves as a boundary condition for w; and (6) is the boundary
condition for h ; with yF determined by (48). The other equations in (5) determine
p; y; .

Proof of Proposition 4: The functions in (14)-(17) must satisfy (2), (4)-(6)
and (47)-(48).
For any wage function of the form w(h) = w0 (h=hm )1

; as in (15), the linear

function h (x) = ah x in (14), with ah in (12), satis es (4). Moreover, for w(h) of this
form the rst line in (5) implies that

Then (2) implies w2 is as in (18), with p0 as claimed.
Then from the second and third lines of (5), y(x) and `(x) have the form

B. The evolution of technology
The distribution function for technology among producers evolves as follows. As
noted above, Xm (t) is nondecreasing. Let t > 0 be a small time increment. For any
t  0 and any X  Xm (t + t ); the number of producers with technology above X
at t + t consists of incumbents at t; adjusted for exit, plus successful innovators of
both types, selected to include only those with technology greater than (1

If F (X; t) has the form required for a BGP and Q(t) grows at the rate g, then

De ne [Q0 ; F^ ; ^ ]; xm ; hm by (22)-(24). Since (24) implies (13) holds, by Proposition
4 the normalized production equilibrium [w; p; h ; y; `; ; yF ] is described by (14)-(17),
so the price and allocation functions are isoelastic.
Then (25), (26) and (28) determine [vf p ; vf i ; vf e ] ; (29) determines vf e0 as a function
of xe0 ; (30) determines ie0 ; (32), (33) and (35) determine [vw ; vwi ; vwe ] ; (36) determines E0 ; (38) determines xe0 ; (40) and (41) determine r and c0 ; and (d) implies
that the the required inequalities hold. Hence the solution describes a BGP.

Proof of Proposition 6: Plotted in n-g space, the pair of equations in (52)
are as shown Figure A1: the line de ned by the rst equation is downward sloping;
the line de ned by the second equation has a positive, zero, or negative slope as
(

For the rst claim, note that   2 implies

2 [0; 1); so [(

second claim is obvious, and the third follows from (53).
Then claims (a) - (c) follow directly from Figure A1. As shown in panel (a), an
increase in h or hi ; or a decrease in h ; shifts the second line upward, increasing g
and decreasing n: As shown in panel (b), an increase in ; x or xi ; or a decrease in

The argument for workers is analogous.
APPENDIX C: NO-GROWTH RESULT
Proof of Proposition 8: If wages and prices are constant over time, a rm's
value is proportional to its pro t, which in turn is proportional to its total wage
bill, and a worker's value is proportional to his wage. Hence vf and vw in (43) and
(45) can be replaced with w(h )` and w; respectively. Then, since by hypothesis the
conditions in (43) hold with equality, the conditions in (45) are equivalent to

With m(xm ) = 1; there is a family of solutions to (62) and (63) indexed by the initial

lie between the locus where m0 = 0

and the vertical axis. The solution requires m(xm ) = 1; so the relevant stable arm lies
in the southeast quadrant, to the left of the m0 = 0 locus and hence below the q 0 = 0
locus. Along other trajectories with m(xm ) = 1; q(x) diverges and (64) is violated.
Thus (m; q) ! (0;

Hence m is strictly positive and everywhere decreasing, asymptotically converging
to zero, while q is everywhere increasing. For the path that converges, (64) holds,
so clearly q(x) takes negative values for x below some threshold and positive values
above the threshold.
