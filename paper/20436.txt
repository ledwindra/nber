Quantifying the Sources of Firm Heterogeneity

ABSTRACT
We develop and structurally estimate a model of heterogeneous multiproduct firms that can be used to
decompose the firm-size distribution into the contributions of costs, “appeal” (quality or taste), markups,
and product scope. Using Nielsen bar-code data on prices and sales, we find that variation in firm appeal
and product scope explains at least four fifths of the variation in firm sales. We show that the imperfect
substitutability of products within firms, and the fact that larger firms supply more products than smaller
firms, implies that standard productivity measures are highly dependent on implicit demand system
assumptions and probably dramatically understate the relative productivity of the largest firms. Although
most firms are well approximated by the monopolistic competition benchmark of constant markups,
we find that the largest firms that account for most of aggregate sales depart substantially from this
benchmark, and exhibit both variable markups and substantial cannibalization effects.

Introduction

Why are some firms larger than others? Some companies, such as the Coca Cola Corporation, generate billions
of dollars of sales and dominate the markets in which they operate. Other companies account for only a small
fraction of the sales of their larger competitors. What explains these vast differences in firm performance?
Answering this question is important for quantifying equilibrium models of firm heterogeneity developed in
the recent trade and macro literatures and for understanding the relationship between microeconomic firm
performance and macroeconomic outcomes.
Recent research on firm heterogeneity in trade and macroeconomics (e.g., Melitz [2003]; Manova and
Zhang [2012]; Feenstra [2014]) points to four components of firm heterogeneity: marginal cost, “appeal”
(quality or taste), markups and product scope (i.e., the number of products produced by firms).1 We develop a
structural model of heterogeneous multiproduct firms that can be used to decompose the firm-size distribution
into the relative contributions of each component. We first use this framework to structurally estimate elasticities of substitution across varieties between and within multiproduct firms. We next implement our modelbased decomposition for the around 20,000 firms that supply goods with bar codes in the Nielsen HomeScan
Database in a typical quarter. This decomposition uses the structure of the model to isolate different margins
in the data without making assumptions about how those margins are related to one another (as in the business
cycle decomposition of Chari, Kehoe and McGratten 2007 in the macroeconomics literature). Our framework
requires only price and expenditure data and hence is widely applicable. We separate out the contributions of
cost and appeal using the exclusion restriction that cost only affects sales through price. In contrast, appeal
affects sales conditional on price.
Our results point to demand differences (which could arise from quality or taste variation) as being the
principal reason why some firms are successful in the marketplace and others are not. Depending on the
specification considered, we find that 50-70 percent of the variance in firm size can be attributed to differences
in firm appeal, about 20-25 percent to differences in product scope, and less than 25 percent to cost. When
we turn to examine time-series evidence, the results become even more stark. Virtually all firm growth can be
attributed to firm appeal with most of the remainder due to product scope. These results suggest that most of
what economists call differences in revenue productivity reflects differences in appeal (e.g., quality or taste)
rather than cost.
Our framework uses a nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility system that allows the elasticity
of substitution between varieties within a firm to differ from the elasticity of substitution between varieties
supplied by different firms. Our choice of this CES demand structure is guided by its prominence, tractability,
and empirical feasibility. Across international trade, economic geography, and macroeconomics, there is little
doubt that this framework is the preferred approach to modeling product variety. Since our approach nests the
standard CES-monopolistic competition model as a special case, we can compare our results with those that
1
Much of the existing empirical literature refers to any shifter of demand conditional on price as “quality,” as in Shaked and Sutton
(1983); Berry (1994); Khandelwal (2010); Broda and Weinstein (2010); Hallak and Schott (2011); and Feenstra and Romalis (2014).
We use the term “appeal” to avoid taking a stand as to whether the shift in demand arises from vertical quality differentiation or
subjective differences in consumer taste. Empirically, we find that higher appeal products are on average more costly to produce, which
is consistent with a quality interpretation.

would be obtained in a standard trade, macro or economic geography model. However, we generalize this
standard model to allow firms to supply multiple products (a pervasive feature of our data) and to have market
power (since the largest firms in our data are far from being measure zero).
Incorporating these features into our structural model yields a number of additional insights. Our model
makes clear a conceptual problem in the estimation of firm productivity that is likely to bias existing estimates.
Most productivity estimates rely on the concept of real output, which is calculated by dividing nominal output
by a price index. However, the formula for any economically motivated price index, which is the same as a unit
expenditure function, is dependent on implicit assumptions about how the output of firms enters utility. Thus,
one cannot move from nominal output to real output without imposing assumptions about the structure of the
demand system.2 Our results show theoretically and empirically that the CES measure of a multiproduct firm’s
price is highly sensitive to how differentiated its output is and how many products it supplies. The sensitivity
of the CES price index to demand parameters, such as the elasticity of substitution and whether multiproduct
firms exist, implies that estimates of real output are equally sensitive to these demand parameters. We show
that if demand has a nested CES structure, conventional measures of real output will have a downward bias that
rises with firm size with an elasticity of around one third. In other words, real output variation is substantially
greater than nominal output variation. This bias also implies that true productivity differences are much larger
than conventionally measured ones.
The bias is driven by two features of reality that are typically ignored in most analyses. First, most analyses
treat producers as single-product firms so they can avoid complications arising from the challenges of measuring the real output of multiproduct firms. However, our results indicate that multiproduct firms are the norm.
For example, we show that 69 percent of firms supply more than one bar code and these firms account for
more than 99 percent of output in their sectors.3 Therefore truly single product firms account for a negligible
share of sales in our data. Second, we show that if the output of multiproduct firms is differentiated, the common assumption that total firm output is simply the sum of the output of each good understates real output for
multiproduct firms, and the degree of this downward bias rises in the number of products supplied.
Our framework also provides a new metric for quantifying the extent to which a firm’s products are differentiated from those of its rivals. If a firm’s products are perfectly substitutable with each other but not with
those of other firms, then 100 percent of a new product’s sales will come from the firm’s existing sales, which
implies a cannibalization rate of one. However, if a firm’s market share is negligible (as it is for most firms)
and its products are as differentiated from each other as they are from products supplied by other firms, none
of a new product’s sales will come at the expense of the firm’s other products, which implies a cannibalization
rate of zero. We estimate that the cannibalization rate for the typical firm is about 50 percent, indicating that
although products supplied by the same firm are more substitutable with each other than with those of other
firms, it is not correct to think of them as perfect substitutes.
2
This point was stressed by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics (Book V, Section 5): ”Demand holds things together as a single
unit.... In truth it is impossible that things differing so much should become commensurate, but with reference to demand they may
become so.” (see http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.5.v.html)
3
By contrast, U.S. Census of Manufactures data indicates that producers of multiple five-digit Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) products account for 37 percent of firms and 87 percent of shipments (Bernard, Redding and Schott [2010]). The difference
comes from defining single product firms as one-industry firms as opposed to one-bar-code firms.

3

We find that the typical sector is characterized by a few large firms with substantial market shares and a
competitive fringe of firms with trivial market shares. Firms from this competitive fringe choose prices close to
the benchmark of monopolistic competition, because they have market shares too small to exploit their market
power. However, the very largest firms that account for disproportionate shares of sales within product groups
have substantially higher markups. This variation in markups is greater under quantity competition than under
price competition. In most sectors, the largest firm has a market share above 20 percent, which enables it to
charge a markup that is 24 percent higher than that of the median firm under price competition and double
that of the median firm under quantity competition. We use the model to undertake counterfactuals, in which
we show that these variable markups for the largest firms have quantitatively relevant effects on the firm-size
distribution and aggregate consumer price indices. Our counterfactual estimates indicate that the multiple
varieties supplied by multiproduct firms reduce the consumer price index by around one third.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II. reviews the related literature. Section III.
discusses the data. Section IV. introduces the model. Section V. uses the structure of the model to derive moment conditions to estimate elasticities of substitution and undertake our decomposition of firm sales. Section
VI. presents our estimation results. Section VII. reports the results of a number of robustness tests. Section
VIII. undertakes counterfactuals. Section IX. concludes.

Related Literature

Over the last decade, the fields of international trade and macroeconomics have undergone a transformation as
the dissemination of micro datasets and the development of new theories has led to a shift in attention towards
firm heterogeneity. Existing research has suggested a number of candidate explanations for differences in
firm performance, including differences in production efficiency (e.g., Melitz [2003]), demand in the form of
product quality (e.g., Sutton [1991]; Schott [2004]; Khandelwal [2010]; Hallak and Schott [2011]; Johnson
[2012]; Di Comite, Thisse and Vandenbussche [2014]; Eslava, Fieler and Xu [2014]; Feenstra and Romalis
[2015]), markups (e.g., De Loecker and Warzynski [2012]; De Loecker et al. [2015]), fixed costs (e.g., Das,
Roberts and Tybout [2007]), and the ability to supply multiple products (e.g., Arkolakis and Muendler [2010];
Bernard, Redding and Schott [2010, 2011]; Eckel and Neary [2010]; Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano [2014];
Eckel, et al. [2015]). While existing research typically focuses on one or more of these candidate explanations,
they are all likely to operate to some degree in the data. We develop a general theoretical model that incorporates
each of these candidate explanations and estimate that model structurally using disaggregated data on prices
and sales by firm and product. We use the estimated model to provide evidence on the quantitative importance
of each source of firm heterogeneity and the ways in which they interact with one another.
In much of the literature on firm heterogeneity following Melitz (2003), marginal cost and appeal (quality or
taste) are isomorphic. Under the assumption of CES preferences and monopolistic competition, cost and appeal
enter equilibrium firm revenue in exactly the same way. However, these different sources of firm heterogeneity
have different implications for firm revenue conditional on prices (e.g., Berry [1994]; Khandelwal [2010]).
While marginal cost affects firm revenue through prices, appeal affects firm revenue conditional on prices.

Thus, if two firms charge the same price, but one firm has a more appealing (e.g., higher quality) product than
the other, that firm will generate more sales. An advantage of our approach is that we observe prices and sales
in our data, and hence we are able to separate out cost and appeal as sources of dispersion in firm sales.4
Most of the existing research on firm heterogeneity in trade and macroeconomics has assumed that firms are
measure zero and compete under conditions of monopolistic competition (e.g., Melitz [2003] and Melitz and
Ottaviano [2008]). In contrast, a small number of papers have allowed firms to be large relative to the markets
in which they operate (e.g., Atkeson and Burstein [2008]; Amiti, Itskhoki and Konings [2014]; and Edmond,
Midrigan and Xu [2015]). When firms internalize the effects of their decisions on market aggregates, they
behave systematically differently from measure zero firms. Even under CES demand, firms charge variable
mark-ups, because each firm internalizes the effects of its pricing decisions on market price indices and these
effects are greater for larger firms.5 Furthermore, since firms are of positive measure, idiosyncratic shocks to
these “granular” firms can affect aggregate outcomes, as in Gabaix (2011) and di Giovanni and Levchenko
(2012). In contrast to these papers, we structurally estimate a model of heterogeneous firms, and show how it
can be used to recover the determinants of firm sales dispersion and undertake counterfactuals.
To the extent that such large firms supply multiple products, they take into account the effect of introducing
new varieties on the sales of existing varieties. Most of the existing theoretical research on multiproduct firms
in trade and macroeconomics has abstracted from these cannibalization effects by again assuming measure zero
firms (e.g., Allanson and Montagna [2005]; Agur [2010]; Arkolakis and Muendler [2010]; Bernard, Redding
and Schott [2010, 2011]; Mayer, Melitz and Ottaviano [2014]; and Nocke and Yeaple [2014]). Important
exceptions that explore cannibalization effects theoretically are Feenstra and Ma (2008); Eckel and Neary
(2010); and Dhingra (2013). In contrast to these theoretical studies, we develop a structural model that can
be used to provide quantitative evidence on how important it is to introduce such cannibalization effects into
models of firm behavior.
Most existing empirical research on multiproduct firms has measured products using production classification codes (e.g., around 1,500 five-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) categories in Bernard, Redding
and Schott [2010]) or trade classification codes (e.g., around 10,000 Harmonized System codes in Bernard,
Jensen and Schott [2009]). In contrast, we measure products at a much finer level of resolution using what
we term “bar codes”—either 12-digit Universal Product Codes (UPCs) or 13-digit European Article Numbers
(EANs)—in scanner data.6 This measure corresponds closely to the level at which product choice decisions are
made by firms, because it is rare for an observable change in product attributes to occur without the introduction
of a new bar code.
Our econometric approach builds on the literature estimating elasticities of substitution and quantifying the
contribution of new varieties to welfare following Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein (2006, 2010). We
4

Our CES formulation of market demand can be derived from a discrete choice model of the demands of individual consumers, as
shown in Anderson, de Palma and Thisse (1992).
5
Our model generates variable mark-ups without a “choke price” above which demand is zero. Therefore this model lies outside
the classes considered by Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) and Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson and Rodriguez-Clare
(2015), in which aggregate statistics such as the trade share and trade elasticity are sufficient statistics for welfare.

Recently, the 12-digit UPCs have been upgraded to 13-digit EAN-13s (European Article Numbers). The extra digit of the EAN-13
allows for more products and firms.

extend this estimation approach to allow firms to be of positive measure relative to the market and to supply
multiple products, which introduces variable markups and cannibalization effects. We show how this extended
approach can be used to recover demand heterogeneity, marginal cost heterogeneity, variable markups, and
cannibalization effects from the data. More generally, although other studies have used scanner data such as
Chevalier et al. (2003), so far these data have not been used to estimate a structural model of heterogeneous
multiproduct firms and quantify the sources of dispersion in firm sales.

Data

Our data source is the Nielsen HomeScan database which enables us to observe price and sales information
for millions of products with a bar code.7 Bar-code data have a number of advantages for the purpose of our
analysis. First, since bar codes are inexpensive but provide sellers access to stores with scanners as well as
internet sales, producers have a strong incentive to purchase bar codes for all products that have more than a
trivial amount of sales.8 This feature of the data means that it is likely we observe all products supplied by
firms. Second, since assigning more than one product to a single bar code can interfere with a store’s inventory
system and pricing policy, firms have a strong incentive not to reuse bar codes. This second feature of the data
ensures that identical goods do not have different bar codes.9 Thus, a bar code is the closest thing we have
empirically to the theoretical concept of a good. Finally, since the cutoff size for a firm is to make a sale rather
than an arbitrary number of workers, we actually observe something close to the full distribution of firms. We
match bar codes to firms using the first few digits of the bar code, which identify the company that owns the
brand, for both domestically-produced and imported bar codes, and for both domestic and foreign companies.10
Nielsen collects its bar-code data by providing handheld scanners to on average 55,000 households per year
to scan each good purchased that has a bar code.11 Prices are either downloaded from the store in which the
good was purchased, or they are hand entered, and the household records any deals used that may affect the
price. These households represent a demographically balanced sample of households in 42 cities in the United
States. Overall, the database covers around 30 percent of all expenditure on goods in the CPI.12 We collapse the
household dimension in the data and collapse the weekly purchase frequency to construct a national quarterly
database by bar code on the total value sold, total quantity sold, and average price.13

Our results are calculated based on data from The Nielsen Company (US), LLC and provided by the Marketing Data Center at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Information on availability and access to the data is available at

GS1 provides a company with up to 10 bar codes for a $250 initial membership fee and a $50 annual fee. There are deep discounts
in the per bar code cost for firms purchasing larger numbers of them (see http://www.gs1us.org/get-started/im-new-to-gs1-us)
9
For example, Broda and Weinstein (2010) compared bar codes with their product descriptions and found “no two identical UPCs
with different product descriptions, or two different UPCs with the same product description.” [p. 695]
10
Firm prefixes are usually seven digits but they can be as long as eleven digits, so we use GS1 data to map the bar codes into firm
identifiers. We could not obtain a firm identifier for just under 5 percent of the bar codes, and so we dropped these products. As an
example of a firm identifier, for an imported spark plug, GS1 identifies the (potentially foreign) company that owns the brand (e.g.,
Bosch). If a bar code is made under license (e.g., Whole Foods contracts with the Coca Cola Corporation to manufacture a 12-ounce
bottle of Cola that is marketed under the Whole Foods brand), GS1 again identifies the company that owns the brand (in this example
Whole Foods).

The data for 2004 through 2006 come from a sample of 40,000 households, while the data for 2007 through 2011 come from a
sample of 60,000 households.

One question that naturally arises is whether it is appropriate to think of US firms competing in a national market or in different

6

Defining products as goods with bar codes has a number of advantages over defining goods by industry
classifications. While industry classifications aggregate products produced by a firm within an industry, our
data reveals that large firms typically sell hundreds of different products within even a narrowly-defined sector.
In other words, while prior work equates multiproduct firms with multi-industry firms, our data hews extremely
closely to what an economist would call a multiproduct firm. In principle, it could be appropriate to aggregate
all output of a firm within an industry into a single good (Is whole milk the same as skim milk? Is a six-pack
of soda the same as a two-liter bottle?). However, as we will show theoretically, the validity of this procedure
depends on the elasticity of substitution between the products supplied by a firm, which is an empirical question.
Instead of relying on product data for a single industry, we observe virtually the entire universe of goods
purchased by households in the sectors that we examine. Our database covers approximately 1.6 million goods
purchased at some point by households in our sample. The data were weighted by Nielsen to correct for
sampling error. For example, if the response rate for a particular demographic category is low relative to the
census, Nielsen re-weights the averages so that the price paid and the quantity purchased is representative of
the United States as a whole.14
Nielsen organizes the bar codes into product groups according to where they would likely be stocked in a
store. The five largest of our 98 product groups are carbonated beverages, pet food, paper products, bread and
baked goods, and tobacco. We report a full list of the product groups in the online supplement. Output units are
common within a product group: typically volume, weight, area, length, or counts. Importantly, we deflate by
the number of units in the bar code, so prices are expressed in price per unit (e.g., price per ounce). When the
units are in counts, we also deflate by the number of goods in a multipack, so, for instance, we would measure
price per battery for batteries sold in multipacks. While about two thirds of these bar-coded items correspond
to food items, the data also contains significant amounts of information about non-food items like medications,
housewares, detergents and electronics.
Table I presents descriptive statistics for our sample of firms and bar codes in the 98 product groups. We
weight the data by the sales of the product group in each quarter and average across quarters because sectors
like carbonated beverages are much larger economically than sectors like “feminine hygiene.” There are on
average 512 firms in each product group with 90 percent of the product groups having more than 200 firms.
We see enormous range in firm product scope. The median number of products supplied by a firm is 4 and the
average is 13. On average, around 440,000 different UPCs were sold each quarter.
One of the most striking facts displayed in this table is the degree of firm heterogeneity. This is manifest in
the skewness of the size and bar-code distributions. The largest firm in an industry typically sells 2,500 times
regional markets. Handbury and Weinstein (2015) argue there is not that much heterogeneity in the price levels of bar-coded goods
across cities. Similarly, we find that national and regional expenditure shares and prices are strongly correlated in the data. National
brands and firms (brands and firms that sell in 10 or more cities) account for 97 and 99 percent of expenditure respectively in cities
with more than 1,000 households in the AC Nielsen data. Regressing the level of prices in these cities on national prices, quarter-year
dummies, and bar-code fixed effects, we find a partial R2 (i.e., an R2 not inclusive of the fixed effects) of 0.98. These results suggest
that most of the variation in U.S. consumer prices reflects national shocks not local ones.
14
Although the bar-code data include mostly final-consumption products, available at retail stores, Section S9 of the online supplement reports the results of a robustness test in which we replicate our empirical procedure using Chilean international trade transactions
data (which includes both final-consumption and intermediate products). We find a similar pattern of results using these international
trade transactions data.

7

more than the median firm. We see similar patterns in terms of product scope and sales per product. The firm
with the most products typically has 97 times more products than the firm with the median number of bar codes,
and the bar code with the most sales on average generates almost 900 times more revenue than the revenue of
the median bar code.
We see in Table II that almost 90 percent of sales in a product group was produced by firms with sales in
the top decile of sales. Table III provides a more detailed description of this firm heterogeneity by focusing on
the ten largest firms in each product group (where we weight the averages by the sales of the product group).
Table III reveals an almost fractal nature of firm sales. Around two-thirds of all of the sales of firms in the
top decile is produced by the ten largest firms (which on average only account for 1.9 percent of firms in this
decile). While on average half of all output in a product group is produced by just five firms, 98 percent of firms
have market shares of less than 2 percent. Thus, the typical sector is characterized by a few large firms and a
competitive fringe comprised of firms with trivial market shares. A second striking feature of the data is that
even the largest firms are not close to being monopolists. The largest firm in a product group on average only
has a market share of 22 percent. Finally, the data reveal that firms in the top decile of sales are all multiproduct
firms, supplying on average 68 different goods with the largest firms supplying hundreds of goods.
The extent of multiproduct firms can be seen more clearly in Table IV, which shows the results of splitting
the data by the number of UPCs supplied by a firm. While single-product firms constitute about one third of all
firms on average, these firms account for less than one percent of all output. In other words virtually all output
is supplied by multiproduct firms. Moreover, the fact that over ninety percent of output is sold by firms selling
eleven or more varieties and nearly two-thirds of all output is supplied by firms selling more than fifty varieties
suggests that single product firms are more the exception than the rule.
Large firms not only sell more products but they also sell a lot more of each product. The penultimate
column of Table IV documents that while the typical bar code sold by a single-product firm only brings in
$63,871 in revenue, the typical bar code sold by a firm selling over one hundred bar codes brings almost twice
as much ($122,045). In other words, large firms not only supply more products but they sell more of each
product. If firms differed only in the fixed cost of adding new varieties, one would not expect to see large firms
sell more of each variety. The fact that they do strongly suggests that large firms must also differ in the marginal
cost or demand for their output.
Finally, although the largest firms have non-trivial shares of particular product groups, these firms are small
compared to the U.S. economy. Ninety-nine percent of firms in our sample have aggregate market shares
(across all product groups) of less than 0.1 percent of total bar-code sales. Even the largest firm only sells 3
percent of total bar-code sales in our sample. Given that sales of packaged goods is only a fraction of total U.S.
sales in all sectors, it is reasonable to conclude that no individual firm has the capacity to affect aggregate U.S.
prices, expenditure or welfare.
In sum, our overview of the data reveals some key features that we model in our empirical exercise. First,
the vast majority of firms have trivial market shares, which means that if we believe that all firms may have
some market power, we need to work with demand systems that do not imply that firms with trivial market
shares have trivial markups. Second, the fact that most economic output is produced by multiproduct firms

8

impels us to build this feature directly into the estimation system and allow for both differences in the fixed
cost of developing new products as well as differences in marginal cost and demand across products. Third, the
fact that there are firms with non-trivial market shares implies that at least some firms are likely to have market
power. To the extent that these large firms internalize the effects of their price choices on market aggregates, this
concentration of market shares will induce departures from the monopolistic competition benchmark. Finally,
the fact that all the firms in our sample are small compared to the U.S. economy means that it is reasonable to
assume that firms do not consider the implications of their pricing behavior on the aggregate economy.

IV.

Theoretical Framework

Our choice of functional forms is motivated not only by the data issues we identified above but also by some
theoretical concerns. Since much of the theoretical literature in international trade and economic geography
has worked with CES models, we want our results to nest this case (at least within product groups), so that our
results easily can be compared with existing work in trade, macro and regional economics. However, we also
need a framework that allows the elasticity of substitution for products supplied by the same firm to be different
than that for products supplied by different firms, thereby to allow for the possibility of cannibalization effects.
Finally, we need a setup that can be applied to firm-level data without imposing implausible assumptions or
empirical predictions. This last requirement rules out two common demand systems: linear demand and the
symmetric translog. A linear demand system would be problematic in our setting because one needs to impose
the assumption that income elasticities are equal to zero and the estimation of marginal costs derived from
a linear demand system can often result in negative values. While the symmetric translog demand system
improves on the linear demand system in this regard, it is a difficult system to implement at the firm level
because it has the undesirable result that firms with negligible market shares have negligible markups.
Our estimation strategy therefore is based on an upper level Cobb-Douglas demand system across product
groups with CES nests below it. The upper-level Cobb-Douglas assumption implies that no firm has an incentive to try to manipulate prices in one product group to influence behavior in another product group. The reason
is that each firm is assumed to be small relative to the aggregate economy (and hence cannot affect aggregate
expenditure) and product group expenditure shares are determined by parameters alone. Therefore the firm
problem becomes separable by product group.15 However, the nested CES structure within broadly defined
“product groups” allows for strategic interactions among firms supplying similar products. Within this structure the real consumption of each product group is composed of the real consumption of each firm’s output,
which itself is made up of the consumption of each of the varieties supplied by the firm.
15

In Section S5 of the online supplement, we show how our approach can be extended to allow for a CES upper tier of utility, in
which case firms have an incentive to price strategically across product groups. We focus on the Cobb-Douglas case in our baseline
specification, because we find that product group expenditure shares are relatively constant over time despite changes in product group
price indices, which suggests that this specification provides a reasonable approximation to the data.

In order to implement this approach, we assume that utility, Ut , at time t is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate of real

where g denotes each product group; ϕG
gt is the share of expenditure on product group g at time t; and Ω is

the set of product groups. Within product groups, we assume two CES nests for firms and UPCs. The first nest
for firms enables us to connect with the existing literature on measuring firm productivity. The second nest
for UPCs enables us to incorporate multi-product firms. Therefore the consumption indices for product groups
G ) and firms (C F ) can be written as respectively:

In other words, the real consumption in any product group, g, is a function of the consumption of each firm
f ’s output, CfFgt , weighted by the consumer appeal of that firm’s output, ϕFfgt > 0, and adjusted for the
substitutability of the output of each firm, σgF > 1, where the set of active firms is ΩFgt .17 Similarly, the subutility derived from the consumption of a firm f ’s output within product group g, CfFgt , is a function of the
U , multiplied by the consumer appeal of that bar code’s output,
consumption of each UPC (i.e. bar code) u, Cut
U
ϕU
ut > 0, and adjusted by the substitutability between the various UPCs supplied by the firm, σg , where the set
18
of these UPCs is ΩU
f gt .

There are a few features of this specification that are worth noting. First, if the elasticity of substitution
across varieties supplied by a firm, σgU , is finite, then the real output of a multiproduct firm is not equal to the
sum of the outputs of each product. For example, if the only reason firms differ in size is that larger firms
supply more varieties than smaller firms, then assuming firm real output is the sum of the output of each variety
will tend to understate the relative size of larger firms. This size bias is a topic that we will explore in much
more detail later. Second, for much of what follows, we are focused on the sales decomposition within a
given product group (g), so for notational simplicity we can suppress the g subscript on σgF and σgU until we
need it again to pool results across sectors in Section IV.F.. Third, we would expect (but do not impose) that
16

We use the superscripts G, F and U to denote product group variables, firm variables, and UPC variables respectively. Time is
indexed by the subscript t. We use the subscripts g, f and u to index individual product groups, firms and UPCs respectively, which
U
G
G
belong to the sets ΩG , ΩF
gt and Ωf gt respectively, where the set of product groups Ω is constant over time. For example, Cgt is the
G
U
product group consumption index for product group g ∈ Ω , and σg is the elasticity of substitution across UPCs within product group
g ∈ ΩG .
17
We allow firms to be active in multiple product groups and firm appeal (ϕF
f gt ) to vary across product groups g. Empirically, we
find firm appeal to be strongly positively correlated across product groups within firms.
18
Our definition of appeal is utility per common physical unit (e.g., utility per ounce of a firm’s output). However, variation in appeal
could be interpreted either as a difference in utility per physical unit or as variation in the number of identical unobservable sub-units
within a physical unit. For example, it is isomorphic to say that Firm A produces products with twice the utility per ounce as Firm B
and to say that 1/2 an ounce of Firm A’s product generates as much utility as an ounce of Firm B’s product. In the latter case, an ounce
of Firm A’s product would contain two “1/2 ounce sub-units”. We think our interpretation of utility per physical unit is the most natural
for our data.

10

the elasticity of substitution across varieties is larger within firms than across firms, i.e., σ U ≥ σ F . When
the two elasticities are equal, our system will collapse to a standard CES at the product-group level, and if
the inequality is strict, we will show that our setup features cannibalization effects. While our nested CES
specification provides a parsimonious and natural approach to modeling multi-product firms, we consider the
robustness of our results to alternative specifications in Section VII..
Fourth, we allow firms to be large relative to product groups (and hence internalize their effects on the
consumption and price index for the product group). But we assume a continuum of product groups so that
each firm is of measure zero relative to the economy as a whole (and hence takes aggregate expenditure Et as
given). When we take the model to the data, we approximate the continuum of product groups in the model with
a large number of product groups in the data, in which each firm is small relative to aggregate expenditure, as
discussed in Section III. above. Finally, since the utility function is homogeneous of degree one in firm appeal it
is impossible to define firm appeal, ϕFfgt , independently of the product appeal of the varieties produced by that
firm, ϕU
ut . We therefore need to choose a normalization. It will prove convenient to normalize the geometric
means of the ϕFfgt for each product group and the ϕU
ut for each firm to equal one:

this normalization, firm appeal (ϕFfgt ) affects the sales of all products supplied by firm f within product group
g proportionately, while product appeal (ϕU
ut ) determines the relative sales of individual products u within firm
f and product group g.19
We can gain some intuition for this framework by using the product group “carbonated beverages” as an
example. Aggregate utility depends on the expenditure share (given by ϕG
gt ) and amount of consumption of
G ). The utility derived from the consumption
goods in the carbonated-beverages product group, (given by Cgt

of carbonated beverages depends on the appeal of Coke versus Perrier (ϕFfgt ), the amounts of each firm’s real
output consumed (CfFgt ), and the degree of substitutability between Coke and Perrier (σ F ). Finally, the real
amount of Coke or Perrier consumed (CfFgt ) depends on the number of different types of soda produced by
each company (NfUgt ), the demand for each of these types of soda (ϕU
ut ), the consumption of each variety of
U ), and how similar varieties of Coke (or Perrier) products are with other varieties offered by the same
soda (Cut

company (σ U ).
The corresponding exact price indices for consumption are:
19

We find identical results with other normalizations. For example, we considered the alternative normalization of setting firm appeal
to 1 for all firms (ϕ̂F
f gt = 1), in which case all variation in expenditure that is not explained by prices or the number of varieties is
captured by product appeal (ϕ̂U
ut ). In this alternative specification, product appeal is identical up to scale to a combination of firm and

how we can use this framework for understanding the different roles played by cost and appeal for the sales of

IV.B.

Technology

We allow the costs of supplying products to the market to vary across UPCs and firms. This specification
encompasses both heterogeneity in productivity across firms (as in Melitz [2003]) and heterogeneity in productivity within firms (as in Bernard, Redding and Schott [2011]). All costs are incurred in terms of a composite
factor input that is chosen as our numéraire. We assume that the variable cost function is separable across UPCs

dition, each firm f faces a fixed market entry cost for each product group of Hgt
U > 0 (e.g., the fixed costs
supplying the market) and a fixed market entry cost for each UPC supplied of Hgt

of product development and distribution). We allow for entry and exit of both firms and products, where for
the data to be an equilibrium of the model, it must be the case that no firm can profitably enter or exit and
no product can be profitably added or dropped. To simplify notation, we again suppress the product group
subscript g on δg until Section IV.F..

Profit Maximization

In our baseline specification, we assume that firms choose prices under Bertrand competition, though we also
report results in which firms instead choose quantities under Cournot competition. Since each firm is small
relative to the aggregate economy and the upper tier of utility is Cobb-Douglas, the firm’s problem is separable
by product group.20 With CES preferences within product groups, the decisions of any one firm only affect

to the smallest (uf gt ) in sales; and the total number of goods supplied by the firm within the product group is
denoted by NfUgt , where uf gt = uf gt + NfUgt .
Multiproduct firms that are large relative to the market internalize the effects of their decisions for any one
variety on the sales of their other varieties. From the first-order conditions for profit maximization, we can
derive the firm markup for each UPC, as shown in Appendix AA.:

where γut denotes marginal cost.
One of the surprising features of this setup is that markups only vary at the firm level within product groups.
This is a generic property of nested demand systems, including nested translog, as shown in Sections S2 and
S3 of the online supplement. The intuition is that the firm internalizes that it is the monopoly supplier of its real
output within the product group, which in our model equals real consumption of the firm’s bundle of goods,
CfFgt . Hence its profit maximization problem can be thought of in two stages. First, the firm chooses the price
index (PfFgt ) to maximize the profits from supplying real consumption (CfFgt ), which implies a markup at the
20
In Section S5 of the online supplement, we discuss an extension to a CES upper tier of utility, in which firms price strategically
across product groups. Given the recursive nature of our estimation strategy, this extension leaves our UPC and firm parameter estimates
and the decomposition of firm sales into firm appeal, product scope and prices unchanged, but alters the decomposition of prices into
markups and costs (because the markup formula changes).
21
We follow existing research on heterogeneous firms in thinking of firms choosing prices faced by the final consumer. In Section
S6 of the online supplement, we show that our empirical approach allows for separate production and retail sector markups (we show
how these markups difference out from our moment conditions), and we show how the model can be extended to incorporate a simple
explicit retail sector.

firm level within product groups over the cost of supplying real output. Second, the firm chooses the price of
each UPC to minimize the cost of supplying real output within the product group (CfFgt ), which requires setting
the relative prices of UPCs equal to their relative marginal costs. Together these two results ensure the same
markup across all UPCs supplied by the firm within a given product group. Nonetheless, markups vary across
product groups within firms (µFfgt 6= µFfmt for g 6= m).22
Although consumers have constant elasticity of substitution preferences (σ F ), each firm internalizes the
effect of its pricing decisions on market price indices, and hence perceives a variable elasticity of demand for
UPC u (εFfgt ) that is decreasing in the expenditure share of the firm f supplying that UPC within product group
g (SfFgt ), as in Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2015). As a result, the firm’s
equilibrium pricing rule (9) involves a variable markup (µFfgt ) that is increasing in its expenditure share within
the product group (SfFgt ). For a positive equilibrium price (9), we require that the perceived elasticity of demand
(εFfgt ) is greater than one (firms produce substitutes), which requires that the elasticity of substitution between
firms (σ F ) is sufficiently large. As a firm’s sales become small relative to the product group (SfFgt → 0),
the mark-up (7) collapses to the standard constant mark-up of price over marginal cost under monopolistic
competition and nested CES preferences (see for example Allanson and Montagna [2005] and Arkolakis and
Muendler [2010]).
Using the above equilibrium pricing rule, profits for UPC u supplied by firm f (ΠU

that the increase in profits from introducing an additional UPC, uf gt + 1, minus the reduction in profits from

U

the share of the firm in expenditure within the product group. This measure of cannibalization is the partial
elasticity of the sales of existing products with respect to the number of products. This partial elasticity captures
the direct effect of the introduction of a new product on the sales of existing products, through the firm and
product group price indices, holding constant the prices and marginal costs of these existing products. This
partial elasticity with respect to number of products is expressed in terms of observed expenditure shares, and
takes the same value under both price and quantity competition, as shown in the appendix.
The first term on the right hand-side captures cannibalization within firms: The introduction of a UPC
reduces the firm price index (PfFgt ), which reduces the revenue of existing UPCs if varieties are more substitutable within firms than across firms (σ U > σ F ). The second term captures cannibalization across firms:
G ), which reduces the revenue of
The introduction of the new UPC reduces the product-group price index (Pgt

existing UPCs if varieties are more substitutable within product-groups than across product-groups (σ F > 1).
There are two useful benchmarks for understanding the magnitude of cannibalization. In both cases, it useful to think of the introduction of a “standardized” product that has a market share equal to the average market
U
U
share of the firm’s other goods within the product group (SN
U Nf gt = 1). We define the “cannibalization
f gt

rate” as the value of the partial elasticity (13) for such a standardized product. At one extreme, suppose that
firms are monopolistic competitors, SfFgt ≈ 0, and all products supplied by a firm are as differentiated among
themselves as they are with the output of other firms, i.e., σ U = σ F . In this case, the cannibalization rate is
zero, because all sales revenue arising from introducing a new product comes from the sales of goods supplied
by other firms. Thus, a world with monopolistic competition and equal product differentiation is a world with
no cannibalization. Clearly, the cannibalization rate will rise if firms cease being small SfFgt > 0 or if goods
supplied by the same firm are more substitutable with each other than with goods supplied by different firms:
σ U > σ F . At the other extreme, suppose that goods are “perfect substitutes” within firms, i.e., σ U = ∞ > σ F ,
so that varieties are differentiated across firms but there is no difference between varieties supplied by the same
firm. In this case, the cannibalization rate is 1, because any sales of a new product are exactly offset by a
reduction in the sales of existing products. Thus the cannibalization rate provides a measure of where in the
spectrum ranging from perfect substitutes to equal differentiation the output of a firm lies.

denotes marginal cost.

Equation (16) decomposes firm sales into seven terms that capture the various margins through which firms
can differ in sales. Clearly these margins are related to one another, since both the number of products and the
markup are endogenous to firm appeal, product appeal and marginal cost. Nonetheless, the decomposition (16)
isolates the direct effects of firm appeal, product appeal and marginal cost from their indirect effects through
the number of products and the markup.
16

Although our decomposition is exact for any co-movement in variables, it is easiest to obtain intuition
for this equation if we consider one-at-a-time, small movements in each variable so that we can safely ignore
interactions between different variables. We therefore will explain the intuition for this equation in terms of
small movements in each variable, and note that in general and in our empirical implementation we will allow
all variables to move simultaneously.
The seven terms in equation (16) can be grouped into four main elements. The first element, in the first
set of braces, captures market size and relative pricing. Our demand system is homogeneous of degree one in
product group expenditures, so firm sales rise one to one with aggregate expenditures. The second term in the
first set of braces captures the impact of the product group price index that summarizes the prices of competing
varieties. Holding fixed a firm’s characteristics, an increase in the product group price level of one percent will

cause the firm’s sales to rise by σ F − 1 percent. Here, the elasticity of substitution between the firm’s output
and the output of other firms, σ F , plays the crucial role of determining how much a relative price movement
affects firm sales.
“Total firm appeal” is captured by the second two terms in braces, which capture the impacts of “firm
appeal,” ϕFfgt , and the number of products the firm offers, “product scope,” NfUgt . Consider two firms that
supply the same number of products, but one firm supplies varieties that consumers prefer (measured in utility
per unit), meaning that ϕFfgt > ϕFf0 gt and NfUgt = NfU0 gt . Firm f will then have higher sales; how much depends
on the elasticity of substitution between firm output, σ F . For a larger value of this elasticity, a given difference
in firm appeal will translate into a larger difference in firm sales.
Now consider two firms that supply products with identical appeal, but one firm supplies more UPCs than
another (NfUgt > NfU0 gt ). Here, it is easiest to think about this term in a symmetric world in which all goods and
F

firms have identical appeal (ϕU

f gt and f ∈ Ωgt ), so we can just focus on the role played by product scope. Although firms have

identical appeal, they do not have identical market shares because they differ in the number of products they
offer, i.e., ln NfUgt > ln NfU0 gt . For example, if consumers treated all UPCs identically regardless of which firm


supplied them, i.e., σ U = σ F , firm f would sell ln NfUgt /NfU0 gt percent more output than firm f 0 . More
generally, if the products supplied by a firm are more substitutable with each other than with those of other
firms, σ U > σ F , the percentage gain in sales accruing to a firm that adds a product will be less than one,
reflecting the fact that a new product will cannibalize the sales of its existing products. Indeed the degree of
cannibalization will depend on the magnitude of σ U ; as this elasticity approaches infinity, the cannibalization
rate will approach one, and all sales of new products will come from the sales of the firm’s existing products.
Hence, in this limiting case of σ U → ∞, adding product scope will have no impact on sales.
The terms in the third set of braces capture the role played by marginal costs. These costs can be divided
into average marginal cost (γ̃f gt ) and “cost dispersion”. Average marginal costs (γ̃f gt ) is the more conventional
measure which captures the fact that high-cost firms have lower sales in equilibrium. The second term captures
the fact that a firm sells more in equilibrium as the dispersion in the cost-to-appeal ratio across its products
increases. The intuition is straightforward. The term in logs is a form of Theil index of dispersion with the
numerator being the cost of production of each variety relative to the average and the denominator being the

17

product appeal relative to the average (which is always normalized to one). Consider a firm that supplies
NfUgt identical varieties at identical cost so that ϕut = γut = γ
ef gt = 1 for all u ∈ ΩU
f gt . In this case, the
cost dispersion term will be zero because there is no dispersion in appeal or marginal cost among the firm’s
products. Now consider a comparative static in which we multiply γut by τ > 1 and divide γkt for all k 6= u
U
by τ 1/(Nf gt −1) . This change has the property of keeping geometric mean marginal costs, γ
e , equal to one
f gt

while increasing the dispersion in the cost of providing each element of the production bundle. Even though
geometric mean marginal costs are unaffected by construction, firm sales will rise because the increase in
dispersion allows the firm to supply its production bundle more cheaply by shifting its output towards the sales
of cheaper varieties. This cost-dispersion term indicates that a firm sells more if its cost-to-appeal ratio is
less evenly distributed across its varieties. Here, we also see the first instance of the insidiousness of demand
for understanding multiproduct firms—in the nested CES case, one cannot express firm-level marginal costs
without reference to the demand parameters σ F and σ U .
Finally, the last term captures the role played by firm markups (µFfgt ), which are themselves a function of
the elasticity of substitution between firms (σ F ) and firm market share (SfFgt ).

Firm Sales Decompositions

While the decomposition given in equation (16) is exact for each sector, it is difficult to use that specification
to understand the general determinants of firm size because aggregate product group expenditures are a major
determinant of firm sales. Therefore we decompose firm sales in each product group relative to the geometric
mean for that product group:

The left-hand side of equation (17) is the sales of firm f relative to average firm sales in the sector, and
the five terms on the right-hand side tell us the importance of relative firm appeal, scope, average marginal
costs, cost dispersion, and markups in understanding cross-sectional differences in firm size. Moreover, we
can also undertake this decomposition for a firm’s sales growth rate by taking the first difference of equation
(17) over time, which in our notation simply involves replacing ∆g in (17) with ∆g,t , where ∆g,t is the double
difference operator relative to the geometric mean for product group g and over time t, so that ∆g,t ln EfFgt =

We now can decompose the cross-sectional variation in firm sales using a procedure analogous to Eaton,

where we have again differenced relative to the geometric mean for the product group. We allow the coefficients
{αgϕ , αgγ , αgD , αgN , αgµ } to differ across product groups. By the properties of OLS, this decomposition allocates
the covariance terms between the components of firm sales equally across those components, and implies
αgϕ + αgγ + αgD + αgN + αgµ = 1. The values for each of the α’s provide us with a measure of how much
of the variation in firm sales can be attributed to each component. If we replace ∆g with ∆g,t in the above
equations, we can determine how much of the variance in firm sales growth rates can be attributed to each
component. Thus, estimation of these five equations provides us with a simple way to decompose firm sales in
the cross-section and in the time-series.

IV.G.

Decomposing Changes in Firm Average Appeal

When decomposing firm growth, we can go one step further and understand how much of a firm’s change in
appeal is due to the introduction of new products and how much is due to changes in the appeal of existing
products. Note that our normalization for UPC appeal implies that the geometric mean of the ϕU

To isolate the sources of changes in firm average appeal, we distinguish between UPCs that are supplied in

both periods versus those that are supplied in only one of the two periods. Let IfUgt = ΩU

The first term in braces captures changes in appeal for a constant set of products, and includes the change in
firm average appeal (∆t ln ϕFfgt ), as well as the difference between average product appeal for the common set
of products (in square brackets) weighted by their relative importance in the set of products in each quarter.
This difference adjusts changes in our measure of firm appeal for changes in our normalization due to the entry
and exit of new goods. We refer to the first term in braces in equation (25) as the “demand effect”. It represents
the change in the appeal of the UPCs present in both periods. If the firm does not add or eliminate any products,
the summation terms will be zero since our normalization means that average log product appeal must be zero
in all periods.
However, if the set of products changes, the summation terms will not necessarily be zero. Product turnover
can influence sales either through product upgrading, which is measured in the second term in braces in equation
(25), as well as through changes in the number of products, which enters separately into the decomposition of
log firms sales in (17). The “product-upgrading effect” (the second term in braces in (25)) captures changes in
appeal from the adding and dropping of products. Product upgrading depends on average product appeal for the
entering and exiting products (in square brackets) weighted by their relative importance in the set of products
in each quarter. For example, suppose a firm introduces a new high-appeal product and retires a low-appeal
product leaving the number of products unchanged. In this case, the second term in braces will be positive,
reflecting the fact that the firm upgraded the average appeal of its product mix.

Structural Estimation

structural residuals to implement our decomposition of firm sales from Section IV.E. with our observed data on
expenditure shares and prices.

Second, we estimate the model parameters σgU , σgF , δg using a generalization of Feenstra (1994) and
Broda and Weinstein (2006, 2010) to allow firms to be large relative to the markets in which they operate (which
introduces variable markups) and to incorporate multiproduct firms (so that firm pricing decisions are made
jointly for all varieties). This estimation uses moment conditions in the double-differenced structural residuals
{ϕFft , ϕU
ut , aut } and also has a recursive structure. In a first step, we estimate the elasticity of substitution
across UPCs within firms and the marginal cost elasticity for each product group {σgU , δg }. In a second step,
we use these estimates for UPCs to estimate the elasticity of substitution across firms for each product group
{σgF }.

UPC Moment Conditions

We now discuss our methodology for estimating the elasticities of substitution σgU , σgF

and the elasticity

of marginal costs with respect to output {δg }, which uses moment conditions in double-differenced values of
n
o
the structural residuals ϕFfgt , ϕU


estimate the elasticity of substitution across UPCs within firms for each product group σgU and the marginal
cost elasticity {δg }. In a second step, we use these estimates for UPCs to estimate the elasticity of substitution

across firms for each product group σgF .
In the first step, we double-difference log UPC expenditure shares (4) over time and relative to the largest
UPC within each firm to obtain the following equation for relative UPC demand:
U
U
∆u,t ln Sut
= (1 − σgU )∆u,t ln Put

(26)

where u is a UPC supplied by the firm; u corresponds to the largest UPC supplied by the same firm (as measured
by the sum of expenditure across the two quarters); ∆u,t is the double-difference operator across UPCs and
U = ∆t S U − ∆t S U ; ∆t is the first-difference operator over time such that

∆ ln aut − ∆t ln aut is a stochastic error. Since the
g
firm markup differences out and we observe prices, our estimation approach is the same under either price or
quantity competition, and hence is robust across these different forms of competition.
Following Broda and Weinstein (2006), the orthogonality of the double-differenced demand and supply
shocks defines a set of moment conditions (one for each UPC):
G(βg ) = ET [vut (βg )] = 0,

where βg =

σgU

(28)



; vut = ωut κut ; and ET is the expectations operator over time. For each product group,
δg
we stack all the moment conditions to form the GMM objective function and obtain:

β̂g = arg min G∗ (βg )0 W G∗ (βg )
βg

22

∀g,

(29)

where G∗ (βg ) is the sample analog of G(βg ) stacked over all UPCs in a product group and W is a positive
definite weighting matrix. As in Broda and Weinstein (2010), we weight the data for each UPC by the number
of raw buyers for that UPC to ensure that our objective function is more sensitive to UPCs purchased by larger
numbers of consumers. We impose the theoretical restriction that σgU , σgF > 0, which is a necessary (though
not sufficient) condition for positive markups. We do not impose the theoretical restrictions that σgU > σgF > 1
and instead check whether these inequalities are satisfied by our estimates. We also do not restrict δg .
The moment condition (28) for each UPC involves the expectation of the product of the double-differenced
demand and supply shocks: υ = ωut κut . From relative demand (26) and relative supply (27), this expectation
depends on the variance of prices, the variance of expenditure shares, the covariance of prices and expenditure
shares, and parameters. Our identifying assumption that this expectation is equal to zero defines a rectangular
hyperbola in (σgU , δg ) space for each UPC within a product group g, along which a higher value of σgU has to
be offset by a lower value of δg in order for the expectation to be equal to zero (Leontief [1929]). Therefore,
this rectangular hyperbola places bounds on the demand and supply elasticities for each UPC within that product group, even in the absence of instruments for demand and supply. Furthermore, if the variances for the
double-differenced demand and supply shocks are heteroskedastic across UPCs, the rectangular hyperbolas are
different for each pair of UPCs within the product group, and their intersection can be used to separately identify
the demand and supply elasticities for that product group (Feenstra [1994]). Consistent with these identifying
assumptions, we find that the double-differenced demand and supply shocks are in general heteroskedastic.23
Our assumption that the double-differenced demand and supply shocks are orthogonal follows a standard
approach in the international trade and macroeconomics literatures (see in particular Feenstra [1994]; Broda
and Weinstein [2006, 2010]). This double differencing is important in addressing most standard endogeneity
concerns. For example, a standard concern is that there may be firm-level shocks (e.g., changes in management) that affect both costs and appeal (quality or taste) across all products. Differencing across products
within firms eliminates such common firm-level shocks. Another standard concern is that products may have
different production technologies, which could affect both costs and appeal (quality or taste) in all time periods.
Differencing over time within products eliminates such time-invariant heterogeneity between products. Therefore our double differencing nets out both these types of shocks. In other words, our identification is based only
on relative differences in demand and supply of individual bar codes.
The second main potential threat to identification is a change in observable product characteristics that
affects both relative costs and relative appeal, but this endogeneity concern is not present in bar-code data.
Fortunately, any substantive change in product characteristics is accompanied by the introduction of a new
bar code.24 Therefore, by using variation within bar codes over time, we hold constant observable product
characteristics. As a result, it is much harder to think of reasons why double-differenced changes in production
costs that leave the observable characteristics of a product constant should affect double-differenced consumer
demand for that product conditional on price. We provide further evidence in support of these identifying
23

In a White test for heteroskedasticity, we are able to reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity at conventional significance
levels for 94 percent of product groups.
24
Minor changes like the style of product label do not result in new bar codes, but retailers and manufacturers do not use the same
bar codes for different products because doing so would interfere with their inventory management.

We use our estimates of the UPC elasticities of substitution σgU from the first step to solve for UPC appeal

ϕut and compute the firm price indices PfFgt using equations (3) and (4). In our second step, we double
difference log firm expenditure shares (4) over time and relative to the largest firm within each product group,
f , to obtain the following equation for relative firm market share:

∆f ,t ln SfFgt = 1 − σgF ∆f ,t ln PfFgt + ωf gt ,

(30)

where ∆f ,t is the double difference operator across firms within a product group and over time such that

∆f ,t ln SfFgt = ∆t ln SfFgt − ∆t ln SfFgt and the stochastic error is ωf gt ≡ σgF − 1 ∆f ,t ln ϕFfgt .
Estimating equation (30) using ordinary least squares could be problematic because changes in firm price


indices could be correlated with changes in firm appeal: Cov ∆f ,t ln PfFgt , ∆f ,t ln ϕFfgt 6= 0. To find a
suitable instrument for changes in firm price indices, we use the structure of the model to write changes in firm
price indices in terms of the underlying UPC characteristics of the firm. Using the CES expenditure shares (4),
we can write relative UPC expenditures in terms of relative UPC prices and relative UPC demand shifters:

Equation (32) decomposes the firm price index into two terms. The first term is entirely conventional: the
geometric mean of the prices of all goods supplied by the firm. When researchers approximate this firm price
index using firm-level unit values or the prices of representative goods supplied by firms they are essentially
capturing this component of the firm price index. The second term is novel and arises because the conventional
price indexes are not appropriate for multiproduct firms. The log component of the second term is a variant
of the Theil index of dispersion.25 If the shares of all products are equal, the Theil index will equal ln NfUt ,
which is increasing in the number of products supplied by the firm, NfUgt . Since the Theil index is multiplied
−1
by 1 − σgU
≤ 0, the firm’s price index falls as the number of goods supplied by the firm rises. This Theil
index also increases as the dispersion of the market shares across UPCs within the firm rises.
25

The standard Theil index uses shares relative to simple average shares, while ours expresses shares relative to the geometric mean.

24

One can obtain some intuition for this formula by comparing it to the conventional price indexes commonly used in economics. Firm price indexes are typically constructed by making at least one of two critical
assumptions—firms only supply one product (NfUgt = 1), or the goods supplied by firms are perfect substitutes
(i.e., σgU = ∞). Either of these assumptions is sufficient to guarantee that the firm’s price level equals its average price level. However, both of these assumptions are likely violated in reality. The average price of a firm’s
output overstates the price level for multiproduct firms because consumers derive more utility per dollar spent
on a firm’s production if that production bundle contains more products. Thus, while the (geometric) average
firm price is a theoretically rigorous way to measure the price level of firms that produce perfect substitutes, it
overstates the prices of firms that produce differentiated goods, and this bias will tend to rise as the number of
products supplied by the firm increases.
U ) only
The structure of the model implies that the dispersion of the shares of UPCs in firm expenditure (Sut

affects the shares of firms in product group expenditure (SfFgt ) through the firm price indices (PfFgt ). Double
differencing equation (32) for the log firm price index over time and relative to the largest firm within each
product-group, we obtain:

this instrument is powerful in the first-stage regression (33), with a first-stage F -statistic for the statistical
significance of the excluded exogenous variable that is substantially above the recommended threshold of 10

Estimation Results

We present our results in several stages. First, we present our elasticity and appeal estimates and show that they
are reasonable. Second we use these estimates to examine cannibalization, and finally we present our results
on the sources of firm heterogeneity.

VI.A.

Estimated Elasticities of Substitution

Because we estimate 100 σgU ’s and σgF ’s, it would needlessly clutter the paper to present all of them individually. Table V shows that goods supplied by the same firm are imperfect substitutes. For UPCs, the estimated
elasticity of substitution ranges from 4.7 at the 95th percentile to 17.6 at the 5th percentile with a median elasticity of 6.9. These numbers are large compared with trade elasticities, reflecting the fact that products supplied
by the same firm are closer substitutes than products supplied by different firms. The median elasticity implies
that a one percent price cut causes the sales of that UPC to rise by 6.9 percent.26
26

The UPC own price elasticity derived in equation (38) is given by

25

A second striking feature of our results is that the elasticity of substitution among varieties supplied by a
firm is always larger than that between firms (i.e., σgU > σgF ). It is important to remember that this is not a
result that we imposed on the data. Moreover, most of the elasticities are precisely estimated—in 82 percent
of the cases, we can statistically reject the hypothesis that σgU = σgF at the 5% level. The higher elasticities of
substitution across UPCs than across firms imply that varieties are more substitutable within firms than across
firms, which implies cannibalization effects from the introduction of new varieties by firms. Moreover, the
fact that the estimated elasticities of substitution are always greater than one implies that firms’ varieties are
substitutes, which is required for positive markups of price over marginal costs (c.f., equation (9)).
In order to assess whether our elasticities are plausible, it is useful to compare our estimates with those of
other papers. In order to do this, we restricted ourselves to comparing our results with studies that used US
scanner data and estimated elasticities for the same product groups as ours. We do this because, as Broda and
Weinstein (2006) show, elasticity estimates for aggregate data can look quite different than those for disaggregate data. Unfortunately, we did not find studies estimating the elasticity of substitution within firms, but we
did find studies that examined elasticities that can be compared with our cross-firm elasticity, σgF . Gordon et
al. (2013) and the literature review therein presents results for comparable product groups using quite different
estimation methodologies. For the twelve overlapping product groups, we find similar results with an average
estimated elasticity of 3.65 compared to 3.14 in Gordon (a difference of around 14 percent), as reported in
further detail in Section S10 of the online supplement.27 Therefore, while our empirical approach has a number
of novel features in modeling multiproduct firms that are of positive measure relative to the markets in which
they operate, the empirical estimates generated by our procedure are reasonable compared to the benchmark of
findings from other empirical studies.

VI.B.

Firm and Product Appeal

Firm and product appeal are a second key component of our decomposition. Our estimation procedure allows
us to estimate a different ϕU
ut for every quarter in our dataset. We have strong priors that product appeal should
be fairly stable across time. One way to gauge this stability is to regress these variables on UPC fixed effects
in order to determine how much of a product’s appeal is common across time periods. When we do this and
include time fixed effects to control for inflation and other common demand shocks, we find that the R2 is 0.84,
which implies that very little of the variation in our measures of appeal arises from changes in appeal within
UPCs over time. We should also expect firm appeal, ϕFfgt , to exhibit a strong firm component. Running an
analogous regression for firm appeal including firm and time fixed effects, we find that the R2 is 0.83.28
We can gain further intuition for the reasonableness of our estimates and the role played by the various sources of firm heterogeneity by computing some simple correlations. Our procedure for estimating the

Table VI, we present the correlations between the relative levels of these variables across bar codes. There are
several important insights from this table. First, relative bar-code appeal (∆f ln ϕU
ut ) and relative marginal cost
U ) are positively correlated. The fact that the correlation is 0.94 means that on average it is more costly
(∆f ln γut

for firms to produce more appealing products. This high correlation is not that surprising because much of the
variation in appeal amongst a single firm’s products probably reflects manufacturing differences (e.g., size and
quality) that are reflected in marginal costs.
Table VI is also useful in understanding the determinants of bar-code sales. While relative bar-code appeal
(∆f

not. How can it be that marginal costs are strongly associated with bar-code appeal, which in turn is positively
correlated with sales, but marginal costs are not correlated with sales? The answer can be garnered from
rewriting our expenditure share equation (4) after log differencing:

across UPCs within firms and hence differences out.
From the above relationship (34), there are two forces at work in these correlations. First, there is the
direct effect of marginal costs on sales through the price channel, which is captured by the first term: higher
marginal costs lead to higher prices and lower sales. However, we also saw that the correlation between appeal
and marginal cost is positive, which arises from the fact that higher marginal costs are associated with higher
appeal products, which tend to have higher sales. The fact that these forces tend to cancel explains why the
correlation coefficients between sales and either marginal costs or appeal are much less than one. The reason
that this attenuation matters more for marginal cost than appeal stems from the variance of the two variables.
The variance of relative appeal is 16 percent larger than the variance of relative marginal cost.29 In other
words, appeal varies more than marginal costs so the high covariance between the two variables cancels out
the tendency of high cost products to have low market shares, but it does not fully negate the tendency of high
appeal products to have high market shares.
Table VII shows that this pattern is even stronger at the firm level. Again we express each variable in
logs and now take differences across firms relative to the geometric mean for the product group (denoted by
29

One can think of this issue in terms of the standard formula for omitted variable
bias.
If we estimate





the coefficient on appeal σgF − 1 will be biased downward by σgF − 1 cov ∆f ln (ϕut ) , ∆f ln (γut ) /var ∆f ln (ϕut ) . The
important point is that the biases in each regression just differ by the magnitude of the variances, but the true coefficients are of the
same magnitude (but opposite sign). Thus, if the variance of appeal exceeds the variance of marginal cost, we are more likely to find
no correlation between sales and marginal cost than between sales and appeal.

27

the ∆g operator). We find that firm appeal is still strongly positively correlated with firm average marginal
costs (∆g ln (γ̃f gt )), presumably because firm appeal is closely associated with manufacturing costs, but the
magnitude of this correlation is lower than at the bar-code level. This lower correlation may reflect the fact that
appeal differences across firms are more reflective of taste differences than products made by the same firm.
Here too, firm appeal is positively correlated with firm sales, but there is no correlation between firm average
marginal costs and firm sales. In the firm-level results, the stronger correlation between sales and appeal is
driven by the fact that the variance of firm appeal is 60 percent larger than that of firm average marginal cost.
Table VII also indicates strong positive correlations between scope and sales and between cost dispersion
and sales, which reflects the fact that larger firms tend to produce more goods.30 Taking Tables VI and VII
together, we find strong but imperfect correlations between appeal and prices at both the bar code and firm
level. These correlations give some support to the work that uses price as a proxy for appeal or quality. While
there is a very strong link between price and quality for products produced by the same firm, there is a weaker,
but still substantial, correlation between price and quality across firms. These results highlight the additional
insights one can obtain by measuring appeal through the lens of our model. Finally, although markups are
positively correlated with sales, they are, if anything, negatively correlated with firm price indices. The reason
is that, although large firms have higher markups for each bar code, they produce so many more bar codes than
small firms that their price index is lower.31
In sum, these correlations point to a number of ways in which our measures appear reasonable: cost, price,
and appeal are all positively correlated at the bar-code and firm level. In addition, appeal is less correlated with
marginal costs across firms than across products within firms. Most importantly for what follows, the fact that
appeal and scope are highly correlated with firm sales but average marginal cost is almost uncorrelated with it
provides the intuition for why our decompositions are going to point to appeal and scope as being the principle
drivers of firm heterogeneity.

VI.C.

Markups

We use our estimated elasticities of substitution to compute implied firm markups, as summarized in equations
(7) and (8). These markups vary along two dimensions. The first is cross-sector variation which captures the
fact that σgF varies systematically across product groups, and the second is within-sector variation which captures the fact that larger firms have higher markups within a sector than smaller firms. As discussed above, our
procedure for estimating the elasticities {σgU , σgF } is robust to the assumption of either price or quantity competition, because the firm markup differences out in equation (26) and we observe prices. However, the markup
formula, and hence the decomposition of prices into markups and marginal cost, depends in an important way
on the form of competition. In our baseline specification, we assume Bertrand competition in prices, but we
30
Across products within firms, we find that large firms are characterized by more dispersion in product appeal. Regressing the
coefficient of variation of log product appeal within firms on log firm sales, and controlling for the log number of products, we find a
positive and statistically significant coefficient on log firm sales.
31
Our estimates of the components of firm sales can be related to the literature on the firm-size distribution (e.g., Rossi-Hansberg
and Wright [2007]). In line with existing results in that literature, we reject the null hypothesis of an untruncated Pareto distribution for
firm sales (the relationship between log rank and log size is concave). Consistent with our finding that firm appeal is the most important
determinant of firm size, we also reject the null hypothesis of an untruncated Pareto distribution for firm appeal (the relationship
between log rank and log size is again concave).

28

report the derivation of the markup under Cournot competition in quantities in the appendix. A key takeaway
from this comparison is that Cournot competition generates substantially higher markups for larger firms than
Bertrand competition if goods are substitutes. Additionally, as shown in the appendix, under Bertrand competition, the relative markups of firms depend solely on the distribution of market shares (and hence are robust
to different estimates of the elasticity of substitution between firms). In contrast, under Cournot competition,
the relative markups of firms depend on both the distribution of market shares and the elasticity of substitution
between firms.
Table VIII reports the distribution of markups across firms in our 100 product groups. The first column
reports the percentile of the markup distribution; the second column reports the Cournot markup; the third
column reports the Bertrand markup; the fourth column reports the markup implied by our parameter estimates
under monopolistic competition across firms (based on σ F ); and the fifth column reports the markup implied
by our parameter estimates under monopolistic competition across UPCs (based on σ U ). The median markup
(under either Bertrand or Cournot) is 31 percent, which is slightly lower than the Domowitz et al. (1988)
estimate of 36 percent for U.S. consumer goods, and slightly above the median markups estimated by De
Loecker and Warzynski (2012) for Slovenian data which range from 17 to 28 percent. This suggests that our
markup estimates are reasonable in the sense that they do not differ greatly from those found in prior work.
Within product groups, the markups of most firms are essentially the same regardless of whether we assume
firms compete through prices or quantities, because most firms have trivial market shares.32 In contrast, the
markups of the largest firms are substantially different. Table IX shows the distribution of the markups for the
three largest firms by product group. In each case, we report the markup relative to the average markup in the
product group, so that one can see how different the markup of the largest firm is. The median largest firm
within product groups has a markup that is 24 percent larger than average if we assume competition is Bertrand
and almost double the average if we assume competition is Cournot. However, as one can also see from this
table, these markups drop off quite rapidly for the second and third-largest firms. Therefore, both modes of
competition suggest that very few firms can exploit their market power.

VI.D.

Cannibalization Rate

Our estimated elasticities of substitution also determine the magnitude of the “cannibalization rate,” defined
as the partial elasticity of the sales of existing products with respect to the introduction of a standardized new
U
U
product with a market share equal to the average market share of the firm’s other goods (SN
U Nf gt = 1 in
f gt

(13)). As discussed above, a cannibalization rate of 0 corresponds to equal differentiation of a firm’s products
from its rivals and a rate of 1 corresponds to a world in which the products of firms are perfect substitutes. On
average across product groups, we find a cannibalization rate for the median firm of around 0.50, which lies
almost exactly between the benchmarks of perfect substitutes and equal differentiation. This cannibalization
level implies that about half of the sales of a new product introduced by a firm comes from the sales of existing
products and half from the sales of other firms. The fact that these cannibalization rates are much less than
32

From the first to the tenth decile of the distribution of sales within product groups, the average Bertrand (Cournot) markup varies
from 0.38 to 0.37 (0.40 to 0.37).

29

one underscores the fact that it is not appropriate to treat the goods supplied by a multiproduct firm as perfect
substitutes nor is it appropriate to treat multiproduct firms as if the introduction of a new good had no impact
on the sales of existing goods.
Cannibalization rates rise with firm size reflecting the fact that large firms take into account that more of
their sales of new products comes at the expense of their existing products. However, we find an average
cannibalization rate across all deciles of the firm size distribution that ranges between 0.50 and 0.51, which
reflects the fact that even in the upper decile of the size distribution most firms have trivial market shares. In
contrast, when the largest firm within a sector (which has an average market share of 22 percent) introduces
a new product, we estimate that 61 percent of the sales of that product comes from the sales of its existing
products. Since we saw from Table III that the largest firms typically have the most products per firm, this
implies that cannibalization is likely to be a first-order issue for them.33

VI.E.

Decomposing Firm Sales

The first panel of Table X presents the decompositions described in equations (18) to (22) for the full sample of
firms and the second presents the results for the largest firms (those with a market share in excess of 0.5 percent).
We run the results over both sets of firms to see if there are any differences between them. Overall, the results
suggest a powerful role for firm appeal in accounting for the size of firms. The variance decomposition indicates
that 76 percent of the overall size distribution can be attributed to firm appeal and 21 percent is attributed to
scope. Thus, “total firm appeal” accounts for 97 percent of variation in firm sales. If we restrict ourselves to
looking at the data for the fifty largest firms we still find that firm appeal explains on average 55 percent of the
variation with scope accounting for 26 percent. In other words, even if we restrict our sample to the largest
firms, variation in firm appeal accounts for around 80 percent of the variation across firms.
What is perhaps most surprising is the small role played by cost in the determination of firm size. There
are two important features of this decomposition to bear in mind. First, a positive coefficient means that larger
firms have lower costs: i.e., cost differentials help explain size differentials. Second, our decomposition allows
us to split firm-cost differentials into two components: average marginal cost differentials and the dispersion
of costs across products (“cost dispersion”). In all cross-sectional decompositions, the cost dispersion term
is positively correlated with firm size. The intuition is simple. Larger firms tend to sell more products and
therefore are better positioned to benefit from cost differentials in supplying their consumption index. The
results for average marginal costs are more mixed. In the full sample, we find almost no association between
firm size and average costs, indicating that larger firms have essentially the same average marginal costs as
smaller firms. Their total costs are lower because they can take advantage of the cost dispersion in their output.
Interestingly, we find a stronger association with average costs when we restrict our sample to only the largest
fifty firms. Here, we find that 17 percent of the firm-size distribution can be attributed to lower average costs
33

In Section S11 of the online supplement, we compare our estimates of cannibalization effects to those in the marketing literature.
In making this comparison, we note that the marketing literature uses different measures of cannibalization effects, and our model
emphasizes that cannibalization effects vary across product groups (with elasticities of substitution) and across firms (with expenditure
shares). Despite these caveats, our findings of substantial cannibalization effects are broadly in line with the consensus in the existing
empirical marketing literature.

30

of large firms and a quarter of the overall distribution is explained by these cost differences. As discussed
in Section VI.B., this ambiguous pattern of results reflects two offsetting effects. On the one hand, higher
marginal costs directly reduce firm sales through a higher price. On the other hand, higher marginal costs are
correlated with higher firm appeal, which raises firm sales. Finally markup variation, which depends on both
appeal and cost through expenditure shares, plays a relatively small role in explaining firm sales dispersion.34
Figure I presents the results of the cross-sectional decomposition for the largest 50 firms in each product
group. Each point represents the average contribution of a particular factor towards understanding the relative
level of sales in a sector. For example, the column of points at the right of the figure indicate that the largest
firm in a product group is on average almost nine log units larger than the average firm. Of this nine-logunit difference the diamond-shaped point indicates that on average about 4.9 log units (54 percent) can be
attributed to firm appeal differences. The circular point reveals that about 2.3 log units (25 percent) is on
average attributable to scope differences, while the triangular and square points indicate that lower average
costs and greater cost dispersion account for about 1.3 (14 percent) and 0.6 log units (7 percent) of sales. These
percentages are extremely similar to the percentages for larger firms that we saw in Table X. However, the fact
that each set of points is relatively tightly arrayed along a line indicates that the results presented in Table X are
not the result of any outlier but are a robust feature of the data.35
There are two other features of the data that this plot also makes clear. First, we can see that while there is
a tendency for average marginal costs to fall with size for the four largest firms, which accounts for the upward
trend in the sequence of triangular points, this upward trend is not a robust feature of the data. This pattern
helps explain why we found in Table X that average marginal costs did not fall with firm size when we looked
at the full sample of firms, but did fall when we restricted our attention to the very largest firms. Moreover, we
can see that the gains from increasing cost dispersion are a robust feature of the data.
The ability of the largest firms to exploit market power is also clearly seen in Figure I. We saw in Table X
that while markup variation played almost no role in understanding the firm-size distribution when we focused
on the full sample of firms, it was negatively associated with firm sales when we examined the largest firms.
Figure I shows that this negative association comes from the fact that if it were not for the fact that the very
largest two or three firms had higher markups (a result we also saw in Table IX), their output levels would
be higher. The implied inefficiently low levels of output of the largest firms suggest that the monopolistic
competition model breaks down for these firms and motivates our attempt to quantify the implications of this
pattern for aggregate consumer price indices in Section VIII..
As discussed in Section IV.F., we can also examine the time-series determinants of firm growth by differencing with respect to time (i.e., using ∆g,t instead of ∆g in the decompositions). As shown in Table X, appeal
matters even more for firm growth. Virtually all of a firm’s growth can be understood in terms of increases in
appeal and scope, with cost changes playing almost no role. Interestingly, product upgrading—i.e., the addition
34
Consistent with these findings, Roberts et al. (2011) find substantial heterogeneity in demand across Chinese footwear producers,
while Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson (2015) emphasize the role of demand in the growth of entering firms.
35
In principle, large firms could supply disproportionately more products than small firms for strategic reasons outside the model
(e.g., to gain shelf space). If this were the case, one would expect the scatter of points corresponding to scope in Figure I to be convex.
However, the relationship between size and scope is remarkably linear, which suggests that we do not observe this type of strategic
behavior on average, although this does not rule out it mattering in some sectors.

31

of new higher appeal products—plays little role in the typical firm’s expansion. However, one must be cautious
in the interpretation of this result for a number of reasons. First, this result does not include the important role
played by scope as opposed to upgrading. Thus, if a firm innovates by adding new products of roughly the same
appeal, we will measure this as an expansion in scope, not appeal. Since we do find that changes in product
scope play an important role in understanding firm growth, our findings should not be interpreted as suggesting
that firms do not grow by adding new products. Indeed, over a quarter of the growth of large firms comes from
this route.
Second, the result masks some important cross-sectoral heterogeneity. Some of our product groups, like
frozen juice, flour, and eggs, exhibit low rates of bar-code turnover reflecting the fact that these are mature
sectors with little potential for innovation. In these sectors, there may be little scope for product upgrading.
However, in the three highest turnover sectors (disposable diapers, photographic supplies, and electronics), we
might expect to see product upgrading play a more important role. In order to investigate this, we created a
measure of innovation in each product group. Following Broda and Weinstein (2010), we defined the product
turnover rate as the total number of bar codes in 2004 that did not survive until 2010 plus the number of new
bar codes in 2010 divided by the total number of bar codes that existed in 2004 and 2010. By construction,
this index will equal zero if there is no turnover of bar codes and one if all bar codes in 2010 are new. The
index ranges from 0.3 for flour and 0.96 for photographic supplies, which corresponds to our priors about the
importance of product innovation in these two sectors.
In order to see how important this heterogeneity is for understanding product upgrading, we regressed the
importance of product upgrading for firm growth against how much product turnover occurs in a product group.
We obtained a coefficient of 0.24 (s.e. 0.08). Similarly, we obtained a coefficient of 0.49 (s.e. 0.10) when we
regressed the contribution of scope towards firm growth on product turnover. In other words, there is a clear
statistical association between how important developing new and improved products are for understanding
firm growth and the overall innovation rate in the sector. Firms in sectors with high rates of product turnover
need to grow by developing new and improved products even more rapidly than their competitors, while this
channel is almost absent in low turnover sectors. These differences are economically significant. New and
improved products (scope and turnover) account for 64 percent of firm growth in our three highest turnover
sectors, but only 10 percent of firm growth in the three lowest turnover sectors. While product upgrading alone
accounts for 15 percent of firm growth in the three highest turnover sectors, it only accounts for 0.2 percent of
firm growth in our three lowest turnover sectors.
Taken together, these decomposition results are quite striking in their consistency about the sources of firm
heterogeneity. Regardless of whether we examine firms in the cross-section or in the time-series, improvements
in firm appeal followed by product scope are the most important drivers of firm sales for both small and
large firms alike. The role played by average marginal cost differences tends to be small and depend on the
sample and decomposition method used. But we consistently find a positive contribution towards differences
in firm size from the cost dispersion term. Finally, we see that although markup differences are unimportant
determinants of firm sales for most firms, they do appear to be important for the very largest firms, something
that suggests aggregate implications from the exploitation of market power by these firms.

32

VII.

Robustness

In this section, we demonstrate the robustness of our main finding that firm appeal accounts for most of the variation in firm sales to three sets of potential concerns: (i) theoretical specification, (ii) econometric estimation,
and (iii) data and measurement.

VII.A.

Theoretical Specification

The first class of concerns focuses on our nesting structure. One limitation of our approach is that to structurally estimate the model we need to assume a particular nesting structure for demand consisting of firms and
products within firms. We choose this nesting structure to connect with the existing literature on measuring
firm productivity (which implicitly or explicitly treats firms as a nest) and as a natural approach to modeling
multi-product firms. But it is reasonable to wonder whether our results are robust to other nesting structures.
In the online supplement, we consider a number of generalizations of our approach, including other nested
demand structures (Sections S2 and S3), the introduction of an additional nest for brands (Section S4), and
a CES upper tier of utility (Section S5). In this section, we provide further evidence that our main empirical
finding about the importance of appeal for sales variation is not sensitive to our assumed nesting structure. To
do so, we use the CES functional form to derive a reduced-form equation that can be estimated for alternative
nesting structures. Although this reduced-form equation cannot be used to recover structural parameters, it can
be used to provide a lower bound on the importance of variation in appeal for alternative nesting structures.
We combine the following two results for CES demand. First, from (30), double-differenced expenditure
shares depend on double-differenced price indices for any tier of utility J. Second, from (32), the price index
for this tier of utility J can be expressed in terms of expenditure shares and the geometric mean of prices for
the lower tier of utility K. Together these two results yield the following reduced-form equation that can be
estimated using OLS:


In our structural model, β2g can be related to structural parameters of the model (β2g = 1/ σgK − 1 ). In
the reduced-form regression (35), this coefficient does not have a structural interpretation, because the term in
appeal for tier j (jgt ) can be correlated with the geometric mean of prices in the lower tier k (PeK ). Therefore,
jgt

if the reduced-form regression (35) is estimated using OLS, the coefficient β2g is subject to omitted variable
bias and is not consistently estimated. For this reason, we use our structural approach developed above to
estimate the model’s parameters for our assumed nesting structure.

33

Nonetheless, the reduced-form specification (35) can be used to provide a lower bound on the importance
of appeal for alternative nesting structures. The reason that this specification provides a lower bound is that
changes in appeal are captured in the estimated residual (b
jgt ). Therefore, the component of appeal that is correlated with the explanatory variables is attributed to the coefficients {β1g , β2g } on these explanatory variables,
leaving only the orthogonal component of appeal in the estimated residual (b
jgt ).
In Table XI, we report the average R2 across all product groups from estimating this reduced-form regression for alternative nesting structures, where one minus this R2 corresponds to the variance in doubledifferenced expenditure shares that is unexplained by the explanatory variables (and is instead explained by
appeal). We estimate the regression separately for each product group and quarter, and summarize the mean
and standard deviation of the R2 , weighting each product group and quarter by their sales.
In the first row of the table, we report results for our assumed nesting structure. In the remaining rows
of the table, we report results for a wide range of alternative nesting structures. While there are 98 product
groups, Nielsen subdivides these into approximately 1,000 “modules,” which are finer categories (e.g., “Nutritional Supplements” is a product group, and Multi-Vitamins” is a module”). “Firm-modules” correspond
to all bar codes in a module sold by a firm (e.g., “Wyeth”) and “Brand-modules” are even more narrow nests
consisting of all bar codes sold by a firm in a module under a particular brand (e.g., “Centrum” and “Centrum
Performance”). Some of these alternative nesting structures disaggregate firms relative to our baseline specification (e.g., Specification II uses Product Group and Brand-Module instead of Product Group and Firm).
Other alternative nesting structures omit firms as a nest altogether (e.g., Specification IV uses Module and
Brand-Module). Across this wide range of specifications, we find that appeal accounts for at least 43 percent
of the variation in double-differenced sales. Thus, regardless of one’s choice of nesting structure, it is hard to
escape the conclusion that around half of sales variation is attributable to variation in appeal. Since this lower
bound also leaves out the important role played by scope, this further reinforces the importance of total appeal
(including scope) in explaining sales variation.

Econometric Estimation

Our firm sales decomposition depends on the model’s parameters and hence a second class of concerns relates
to the estimation of these parameters. At the simplest level, one might worry about whether our estimation
procedure in subsections V.B.-V.C. can successfully recover the model’s parameters. To address this concern,
we undertake a Monte Carlo simulation (section S8 of the online supplement), in which we show that our
estimation procedure consistently recovers the true parameters when the data are generated from the model.
Therefore our estimation procedure works when our identifying assumptions are satisfied.
However, what if our identifying assumptions are not satisfied? As a first step to addressing this concern,
we report a number of additional specification checks. First, we use the fact that we have data on different
brands supplied by firms within product groups. Therefore, instead of double differencing relative to a firm’s
largest product, we double difference relative to a firm’s largest product within the same brand. We continue
to find a similar pattern of results as in our baseline specification, which suggests that our estimates are not

34

driven by shocks to both demand and supply for brands.36 Second, under our identifying assumption that
double-differenced demand and supply shocks are orthogonal to one another, the time interval over which we
difference should not affect the results. In contrast, if demand and supply shocks are correlated, the time interval
over which we difference could matter, because for example of seasonal fluctuations in demand. Estimating
over time intervals ranging from a quarter to a year, we continue to find a similar pattern of results, consistent
with our identifying assumption.37
Nonetheless, there could be further econometric concerns or data issues that are not fully addressed in these
robustness checks. Fortunately, it is easy to deal with concerns about whether our particular elasticity estimates
are driving our firm sales decomposition results. Put simply, if our decomposition results are influenced by
an estimation problem, then we should obtain different results from this decomposition using different values
for the model’s parameters. We therefore can dispose of this concern by examining the sensitively of our
decomposition of firm sales (15) to all reasonable estimates of the model’s parameters.
In Section S7 of the online supplement, we report the results of a grid search over a wide range of values for
the elasticities of substitution {σgU , σgF }. In particular, we consider a range of possible values for σ F at intervals
of 0.5 from 2 (half our median estimate for σ F ) to 12 (four times our median estimate for σ F ) and σ U ranging
from 2.5 (just under half the median estimate) to 20 (almost triple the median estimate). Consistent with our
empirical estimates above, we restrict attention to values on this parameter grid for which σgU > σgF > 1.
For each parameter configuration, we replicate our firm sales decomposition (15), which holds regardless of
the value for δg because it is based on observed prices. Naturally, the precise relative contribution of each
component varies depending on parameter values. But we find that firm appeal and scope account for more
than 80 percent of firm sales variation (and firm appeal alone accounts for at least 50 percent of firm sales
variation) across the wide range of parameter values on the grid. In other words, the result that firm appeal and
scope are the main determinants of firm size is a deep feature of looking at the world through a CES setup and
is not dependent on our particular elasticity estimates. The underlying feature of the data driving this result is
the substantial variation in firm sales conditional on price. For plausible values of the elasticity of substitution,
the model cannot explain this sales variation by price variation, and hence it is attributed to appeal. While
we derive our results for a CES setup, we conjecture that this underlying feature of the data would generate a
substantial role for demand shifters in explaining firm sales variation for a range of plausible demand systems.

VII.C.

Data and Measurement

A third class of concerns relates to data and measurement. We use data on bar codes because they correspond
closely to the economic concept of a product and hold observable product characteristics constant. But one
might worry that marketing, taste and other non-technical dimensions of appeal might be more important
for consumer non-durables than for traded goods (which include intermediate inputs) or consumer durables.
Alternatively, one might worry that because we do not have data on wholesale prices, we are missing important
36
Differencing within brands (rather than within firms), we find median estimates for σ U of 6.49 (compared to 6.93 in our baseline
specification) and for σ F of 3.74 (compared to 3.92 in our baseline specification).
37
Differencing over years rather than over quarters, we find median estimates for σ U of 7.06 (compared to 6.93 in our baseline
specification) and for σ F of 4.37 (compared to 3.92 in our baseline specification).

35

variation in retail markups or marketing. To address these concerns, Section S9 of the online supplement reestimates our econometric specification using Chilean international trade transactions data. Despite the use of
different types of data and different definitions of products (e.g., bar codes versus 8-digit Harmonized System
(HS) products), we continue to find that most of firm sales variation is explained by firm appeal and scope.
Therefore, our findings are not dependent on our data and apply to other types of goods.

VIII.

Firm and Aggregate Implications

Thus far, we have been focused on using our structural model to quantify the sources of firm heterogeneity.
However, our results also have implications for the measurement of firm productivity and the aggregate consequences of departures from the benchmark of monopolistic competition. We now consider each of these
implications in turn.

VIII.A.

Firm Output and Productivity

All productivity estimates are based on a concept of real output, which in theory equals nominal output divided
by a price index, but the choice of price index is not arbitrary: it is determined by the utility function. In
other words, for multiproduct firms, the concept of real output is not independent of the demand system, so
all attempts to measure productivity based on a real output concept contain an implicit assumption about the
structure of the demand system.38
We can see how much it matters whether a researcher takes into account the fact that virtually all firms
produce more than one product by considering two approaches to measuring firm output. The first is a “common
sense” or conventional price index, PFfgt , which is a quantity-weighted average price of a firm’s output. The
second is the CES price index, which equals nominal output divided by the minimum expenditure necessary
to generate a unit of utility. According to equation (1) the quality-adjusted flow of consumption from a firm’s
output is ϕFfgt CfFgt , so the corresponding expenditure function for a unit of consumption is PfFgt /ϕFfgt .
Obviously, different price index formulas will yield different measures of prices, but there are two issues:
how big is the measurement error and is the common-sense approach biased? It’s easy to see that the answer to
the second question must be “yes.” Equation (32) indicates that, in the CES system, the use of average goods
prices to measure firm-level prices will overstate the price level (and understate real output) more for large,
multiproduct firms than for small, single-product ones. Therefore, if the true model is CES but a researcher
uses a conventional price index, the results are likely to underestimate the output of large firms relative to small
firms.
We can understand the magnitudes of the measurement error and bias of conventional approaches through
a simple exercise. If we denote the consumer’s expenditure on a firm’s output by EfFgt , we can write the
conventional measure of real output, QFfgt , as EfFgt /PFfgt , and the CES measure of real output, QFfgt , as


EfFgt / PfFgt /ϕFfgt . These measures will vary across sectors due to the units, so in order to compare size vari38

Since firms supply differentiated products, the relevant measure of productivity is TFPR (Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson
[2008]), which necessarily depends on prices and hence the specification of demand.

36

ation across sectors we will work with unitless shares of each firm in sectoral output (i.e., QFfgt /
P
and QFfgt / f ∈ΩF QFfgt ).

P

f ∈ΩF
gt

QFfgt

gt

Figure II plots these two measures of real output. We place the CES market shares on the horizontal axis
because the conventional index is only correct in the special case in which the elasticity of substitution is infinite
and therefore output measures computed using the conventional index are likely to be measured with error. As
one can see in Figure II, the choice of price index matters enormously for the computation of real output. If
P
P
one regresses QFfgt / f ∈ΩF QFfgt on QFfgt / f ∈ΩF QFfgt , one only obtains an R2 of 0.77 with a coefficient of
gt

gt

0.65 (s.e. 0.004). These results imply that about a quarter of the variation of firm-level real output one would
obtain by using a conventional price index is simply due to the fact the conventional price index assumes that
firms produce homogeneous output: an assumption that easily can be rejected. Moreover, studies based on
conventional measures of firm prices understate the real output of large firms by a third relative to small firms,
with implications for estimates of returns to scale and productivity. Even if one does not believe that the CES
framework is the right one to measure demand, the results mean that the implicit choice of demand system
contained in a price index is of first-order importance in the measurement of real output.

VIII.B.

Aggregate Consumer Price Indices

We now turn to the implications of our estimates for aggregate consumer price indices. We undertake two
counterfactuals to highlight the quantitative relevance of our departures from the benchmark of single-product,
monopolistically competitive firms. First, we consider the implications of a regulator preventing large firms
from exercising their market power and thereby requiring each firm to compete under monopolistic competition.
Second, we consider the implications of allowing firms to supply a number of differentiated products. Thus,
this second counterfactual examines the effect on the consumer price index from the different varieties supplied
by each firm.
In each counterfactual, we report results for both Bertrand and Cournot competition. In each case, we hold

F
constant aggregate expenditure, factor prices, the sets of active UPCs and firms ΩU
f gt , Ωgt , firm and product
n
o
appeal ϕFfgt , ϕU
ut , and the cost shifters {aut }. Therefore we abstract from the effect of changes in profits
on aggregate expenditure. We also abstract from general equilibrium effects through firm entry and exit. Our
goal is not to capture the full general equilibrium effects of each counterfactual, but rather to show that our
firm-level estimates are of quantitative relevance for aggregate consumer price indices.
In the first set of counterfactuals (Counterfactuals I-B and I-C), we compare the actual equilibrium in which
firms exploit their market power with a counterfactual equilibrium in which a price regulator requires all firms
to charge the same constant markup over marginal cost equal to the monopolistically competitive firm markup:
µFfgt =

σgF
.
σgF − 1

(36)

Moving from the actual to the counterfactual markup reduces the relative prices of successful firms with
high market shares and hence redistributes market shares towards these firms. Therefore, we expect these
counterfactuals to reduce the consumer price index and increase the dispersion of firm sales, but the magnitude

n
o

of these effects depends on the estimated parameters σgU , σgF , δg , firm and product appeal ϕFfgt , ϕU

 U
and the cost shifters aut .
Given the assumed constant markup in equation (36), we solve for the counterfactual equilibrium using
an iterative procedure to solve for a fixed point in a system of five equations for expenditure shares and price

the firm price index (given by (3) for firms) and the product group price index (given by equation (3) for product
groups). We use the resulting solutions for product group price indices to compute the aggregate consumer price

Q
G ϕgt .
index: G
g=1 Pgt
In Counterfactuals II-B and II-C, we examine the quantitative relevance of multiproduct firms. We compare the actual equilibrium in which firms supply multiple products to a counterfactual equilibrium in which
firms are restricted to supply a single UPC (their largest). Counterfactual II-B undertakes this comparison assuming Bertrand competition, while Counterfactual II-C undertakes the same comparison assuming Cournot
competition. We again solve for the counterfactual equilibrium by solving for a fixed point in the system of
five equations for expenditure shares and price indices discussed above.
Table XII reports the results from both sets of counterfactuals. Each row of the table corresponds to a
different counterfactual. Each column reports the value of a variable in the counterfactual relative to that in
the actual data. The second column reports the relative coefficient of variation of firm sales. The third column
reports the relative consumer price index.
In Counterfactual I-B, we find that moving from Bertrand to monopolistic competition reduces the consumer price index by around 4 percent, which is quantitatively relevant compared to standard estimates of the
welfare gains from trade for an economy such as the United States. In Counterfactual I-C, we find much larger
effects from moving from Cournot to monopolistic competition, which reduces the consumer price index by
around 13 percent. These much larger effects reflect the fact that large firms charge much higher markups
under Cournot than under Bertrand competition as we saw in Table IX. This result implies larger price reductions from moving to monopolistically competitive markups, and hence larger reductions in the consumer price
index. In both Counterfactuals I-B and I-C, the relative prices of the largest firms fall and demand is elastic.
Therefore, the coefficient of variation of firms sales increases, by around 11 percent for Bertrand competition and around 39 percent for Cournot competition. Again, the larger effects for Cournot reflect the greater
variation in markups under this mode of competition.
In both Counterfactuals II-B and II-C, we find quantitatively large effects of multiproduct firms. Restricting
firms to supply a single product under Bertrand competition increases the consumer price index by around 49
percent and reduces the coefficient of variation of firm sales by around 17 percent. The corresponding increase
in the consumer price index and reduction in the coefficient of variation of firm sales under Cournot competition
are similar: 47 percent and 14 percent respectively. These results suggest that consumers benefit enormously
from the range of products supplied within a single firm.
All of these counterfactuals are subject to a number of caveats. In particular, they do not allow for firm entry
or exit, because they hold the set of firms constant, and they abstract from the effect of changes in profits on

38

aggregate expenditure. Nonetheless, these counterfactuals establish the quantitative relevance of our departures
from the case of monopolistic competition with single product firms.

IX.

Conclusions

We develop and structurally estimate a model of heterogeneous multiproduct firms that can be used to decompose the firm-size distribution into the contributions of costs, appeal, scope and markups. Our framework
requires only price and expenditure data and hence is widely applicable. We use these price and expenditure
data to estimate the key parameters of the model, namely the elasticities of substitution between and within
firms, and the elasticities of marginal cost with respect to output. We use the resulting parameter estimates and
the structure of the model to recover overall firm and product appeal, marginal costs, the number of products a
firm supplies, and the firm’s markup.
Our results point to differences in firm appeal as being the principal reason why some firms are large and
others are not. Depending on the specification considered, we find that 50-75 percent of the variance in firm
size can be attributed to differences in appeal, about 20-25 percent to differences in product scope, and less
than 20 percent to average marginal cost differences. If we use a broad measure of total firm appeal, which
encompasses both firm appeal as well as scope, we find that total firm appeal accounts for almost all of firm
size differences.
We estimate substantially higher elasticities of substitution between varieties within firms than between
firms (median elasticities of 6.9 and 3.9 respectively), implying that a firm’s introduction of new product varieties cannibalizes the sales of existing varieties. We estimate that the cannibalization rate for the typical
firm is 0.50, roughly half-way in-between the extreme of no cannibalization (equal elasticities of substitution
within and between monopolistically competitive firms), and the extreme of complete cannibalization (varieties
perfectly substitutable within firms).
We find that the typical sector comprises a few large firms with substantial market shares and a competitive
fringe of firms with trivial market shares. Therefore most firms charge markups close to the monopolistic
competition benchmark of constant markups, because they have trivial market shares and hence are unable to
exploit their market power. However, the largest firms that account for up to around 25 percent of sales within
sectors charge markups between 24 and 100 percent higher than the median firm. Using the estimated model
to undertake counterfactuals, we find that these departures from the monopolistically competitive benchmark
raise aggregate consumer price indices by between 4 and 13 percent.
Our findings that firms supply multiple imperfectly substitutable varieties have important implications for
the measurement of firm productivity, highlighting the role of assumptions about demand in the measurement of
productivity for multiproduct firms. Conventional price indices based on a weighted average of firm prices do
not take into account that the theoretical price index for the firm depends on the number of products it supplies
whenever consumers care about variety. Indeed, our counterfactual exercise indicates that the multiple varieties
supplied by multiproduct firms reduce the aggregate consumer price index by around one third. Moreover,
ignoring this effect introduces a systematic bias into the measurement of firm productivity, because larger firms

39

supply more products than smaller firms. We find this bias to be quantitatively large. An increase in firm sales
is associated with around a one third larger increase in true real output (using the ideal price index) than in
measured real output (using the conventional price index).

decomposition of observed prices into markups and marginal costs, these derivatives are the same under both
forms of competition. Therefore the derivation of the cannibalization rate is the same under both forms of
competition.

Therefore the analysis with Cournot competition in quantities is similar to that with Bertrand competition
in prices, except that firms’ perceived elasticities of demand (εFfgt ) and hence their markups differ between
these two cases. Since firms internalize their effects on product group aggregates, markups are again variable.
Furthermore, markups are common across UPCs within a given firm and product group, but vary across product
groups within firms for the reasons discussed in the main text above.

Our estimation procedure for σ U , σ F , δ remains entirely unchanged because the firm markup differences

The ratio of the two markups (for σ F finite and SfFgt < 1) is:
1 + SfFgt (σ F − 1)
1 − SfFgt

.

Therefore, the dispersion of relative markups under Cournot competition is increasing in the elasticity of substitution (σ F ), and depends on both this elasticity and the dispersion of expenditure shares.

Note: The graph contains the weighted average across product groups (by quarter) of the decomposition of relative firm
sales into the contributions of the firm appeal, marginal cost, markup and product scope for the fifty firms with the largest
average market share in 2004 and 2011. The vertical axis measures the contribution of each factor given by the left-hand
sides of equations (18) to (22). The horizontal axis is the log difference between the firm’s sales and that of the average
firm defined by the right-hand side of these equations. Calculated based on data from The Nielsen Company (US), LLC
