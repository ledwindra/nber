    "abstract": "\n\nI discuss private and central-bank-issued digital currencies, summarizing my prior research. I argue that prices of private digital currencies such as bitcoin follow random walks or, more generally, risk-adjusted martingales. For central bank digital currencies, I argue that they enhance the \u201cCBDC trilemma\u201d facing a central bank: out of the three objectives, price stability, efficiency, and monetary trust, it can achieve at most two.\n\n",
