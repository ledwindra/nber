ABSTRACT
During the last quarter century, mortgage interest deductibility has been gradually phased out. In
1974 a ceiling was set on the size of the mortgage eligible for interest deductibility (£30,000 since 1983), and,
beginning in 1993, the maximum rate at which interest under that ceiling could be deducted was reduced in
four steps to zero in 1999. The combination of these changes gives a rich array of different debt tax penalties
for different households in different years. We analyze over 117,000 loans originated in the UK during the
1988-91 and 1995-98 periods to finance home purchases. We first estimate a logit to predict whether a
household’s loan exceeds the £30,000 ceiling. These predicted probabilities are then employed to construct
debt tax penalty variables that are used to explain household LTVs on loans to finance home purchases. The
penalty variables depend on the predicted probability of having a loan that exceeds the ceiling, the market
mortgage rate, and exogenous household specific tax rates. From these results we compute estimates of the
impact of removing deductibility on initial LTVs in the UK and on the weighted average cost of capital for
owner-occupied housing. Removal of deductibility is estimated to reduce initial LTVs, which mitigates the
rise in the weighted average cost of capital, by about 30 percent, with the reduction varying with household
age, loan size (above or below the £30,000 limit) and tax bracket.

Household Leverage and the Deductibility of Home Mortgage Interest: Evidence from UK
House Purchasers
Introduction
Periodically people propose removal of the home mortgage interest deduction in the U.S. (Follain
and Melamed, 1998). The primary motivation for such proposals is recapture of tax revenue lost by the
deduction – it is a major “tax expenditure.” According to Follain and Melamed the official annual
expenditure in the middle 1990s was $40 to $50 billion.1 Numerous advocates would prefer to use these
funds in a multitude of different ways. A secondary argument for removal of the deduction is that the
expenditure is sharply skewed toward higher income households who are more likely to be homeowners and
to finance large houses.
On the other hand, the mortgage interest deduction encourages home ownership and others argue that
home ownership provides many positive externalities and thus ought to be encouraged. These include that
ownership leads households to better maintain their dwellings and to raise children that do better on
achievement tests and have fewer behavioral problems (Haurin, et. al., 2002). Moreover, eliminating the
mortgage interest deduction wouldn’t remove the fundamental tax advantage to home ownership – the
favorable tax treatment of capital gains and imputed rents (Hendershott and Slemrod, 1983), but would just
restrict the advantage to wealthy households that do not need to use debt finance (Woodward and Weicher,
1989).
This paper is not about the appropriateness of the mortgage interest deduction. Rather it is about the
impact of the deduction on the use of debt to finance house purchases. This topic is crucial to both the
amount the deduction lowers government tax revenue and the impact of deductibility on homeownership. If
households were to sell taxable bond holdings to mortgage lenders and pay off their entire mortgage debt in
response to elimination of deductibility, the government would gain no tax revenue and the cost of financing
home ownership would be unchanged (assuming households and lenders pay the same tax rate). Portfolio
reallocations with no real or tax consequences would be the sole result. At the other extreme, if households

2).
2

did not reduce their leverage, their after-tax income would fall and both the cost of homeownership and
government tax revenues would rise significantly. Estimating where between these polar extremes
household behavior lies is the purpose of this paper.
The fundamental tax advantage to owner-occupied housing is the generally low taxation of the return
on the equity invested in the house (Hendershott and White, 2000). Few countries tax capital gains (the U.S.
excludes the first $500,000 in gain), and, while a few European countries tax imputed rents (the U.S. does
not), they are taxed at lower effective rates than private market rents are taxed. The magnitude of the
fundamental tax advantage is directly related to the levels of both nominal pretax asset returns in the
economy and household marginal income tax rates. The higher the level of returns and/or tax rates, the more
valuable is the low taxation of the returns on owner-occupied housing. Because the tax advantage increases
as the marginal tax bracket of the household increases, the demand for owner-occupied housing is greater the
higher the tax bracket of the household (holding after-tax income constant). The housing tax advantage is
clearly less in countries with flat (low) tax rate schedules.
In the quarter century after 1938, the UK sharply reduced the relative taxation of equity-financed
owner-occupied housing.2 When income taxation was reintroduced in 1842, imputed rent was set equal to an
assessed value, which equalled an estimate of market rate and was taxed under ‘Schedule A’ of the income
tax system, and mortgage interest (all household interest payments) was fully deductible (Hills, 1991).
Reassessments were made every five years until 1935. By 1961, when the next reassessment was
undertaken, imputed rent had been eroded by inflation to only a third of market rent. In 1963 the
Conservative Government abolished taxation of imputed rents altogether, increasing and making permanent
the low taxation of this component of return. The tax advantage to the capital gains component of return
commenced when the capital gains tax, introduced in 1965, exempted gains on owner-occupied housing.
The deductibility of home mortgage interest is a means of extending the fundamental tax advantage
of owner-occupied housing, the low taxation of the return on equity invested in housing, to the numerous
younger, less wealthy households who cannot finance their purchase entirely with equity. Most developed
2

During the 1980s the UK and many other countries sharply increased the relative taxation of equityfinanced owner-occupied housing by significantly cutting the tax rates applied to other capital income.
3

countries allow a mortgage interest deduction, although many European countries limit it to a fixed amount
or allow the deduction to be taken only at a tax rate less than that of many household marginal rates. In
contrast, the Commonwealth countries -- Australia, Canada, New Zealand and now the UK – do not allow
this interest deduction.
In fact, interest has never been fully deductible in the U.S. Low income households or households
with low mortgage debt living in states with low house prices and low taxation (state taxes and mortgage
interest are the two largest deductible expenses) would select not to itemize expenses because taking the
standard deduction would lower their taxes (Ling and McGill, 1998). Further, even if a household did
itemize, not all mortgage interest was effectively deductible (the amount of interest that raised total
deductible expenses to the standard deduction was “wasted”). The amount of wasted interest (and the
number of households that chose not to itemize) grew following the 1986 tax act for two reasons
(Hendershott, Follain and Ling, 1987). First, a number of expenses that were previously deductible could no
longer be itemized, probably the most important being the interest on consumer credit debt. Second, the
standard deduction was sharply increased. The 1986 act also phased out itemized deductions when
household income rose above threshold levels, limiting deductibility for very high income households to as
little as 20 percent of their interest paid.
Follain, Ling, and various associates have used the change in the effective deductibility of mortgage
interest induced by the 1986 tax act to test the hypothesis that household leverage is sensitive to the tax
penalty associated with debt (Follain and Ling, 1991, Ling and McGill, 1998, Follain and Dunsky, 1997, and
Dunsky and Follain, 2000). In each case, the leverage of individual households was found to be related
significantly to the effective deductibility of mortgage interest. This work, which requires forecasting
various unavailable household expenses and determining whether households would select to itemize or take
the standard deduction, is innovative indeed. Using the Dunsky and Follain estimates, Follain and Melamed
(1998) built a simulation model and predicted that removal of the mortgage interest deduction would lower
mortgage debt by 41 percent.

4

The 41 percent estimate is roughly consistent with the aggregate comparison between Australia (AU)
and the U.S. made by Capozza, Green and Hendershott (1996). They relate the LTVs of nearly 12,000 U.S.
households in the 1989 Survey of Current Finances to the age of the household head and the log of income.
This mimics the LTV estimates of Bourassa and Hendershott (1994) for just over 4,000 Australian
households in 1986. Because interest is not deductible in Australia and is in the U.S., one would expect that
the LTVs would be lower at all ages in Australia than in the U.S., and they are. The predicted U.S. (and AU
in parentheses) LTVs for households of ages 25-29, 40-44, and 55-59 are 0.56 (0.42), 0.34 (0.12) and 0.16
(0.01).
Mortgage interest in the UK was fully deductible until 1974. At that time, a £25,000 ceiling was
introduced on the size of mortgage eligible for interest deductibility. Given that the mean house price was
£10,000, this ceiling affected few households. But because the ceiling was not indexed, it became
progressively more binding over time as nominal house prices rose, and by 1990 it affected half of purchase
loan originations. In addition, in 1993 the tax rate at which interest on debt below the ceiling could be
deducted was lowered below the maximum rate at which income was taxed. In 1999 this rate was lowered to
zero; deductibility was thus eliminated altogether.
The 1988-98 period of gradual removal, where households faced substantially different degrees of
deductibility, is an ideal period to study the sensitivity of homeowner leverage to the deductibility of interest
and to draw some inferences about the likely impact of the removal of interest deductibility on debt usage
and the weighted average cost of capital for owner-occupied housing. Such is the goal of the present paper.
The remainder of the paper is divided into three sections and a conclusion/summary. We first derive
debt tax penalty variables and present our estimation strategy. We then describe our database, including how
we deal with credit rationing. Finally, we report our results based upon 1988-91 and 1995-98 loan samples.

The Debt Tax Penalty and Form of the Estimation Equations
As noted above, mortgage interest deductibility is a means of extending the fundamental tax
advantage of owner-occupied housing to households who use debt finance. Deductibility does not

5

make debt cheaper than equity, rather it maintains tax equality between the two costs. Thus to the
extent that the deduction is limited, there is a tax cost or penalty to using debt and usage should be less.

Measurement of the Tax Penalty on Debt
This argument can be formalized in the following way. In general, the weighted average cost of
capital for owner-occupied housing is just an average of the debt (CD) and equity (CE) costs where the
weights are the loan to value ratio, LTV, and 1-LTV:
WACC = LTV(CD) + (1-LTV)(CE).

(1)

If the costs, CD and CE, both equal the after-tax interest rate, (1-t)i, then WACC = (1-t)i (we abstract from
risk premia). However, if a tax penalty (pen) is imposed on debt usage, its cost is (1-t+pen)i and
WACC = (1-t)i + LTV(pen)i.

(2)

If the penalty is the nondeductibility of interest, pen = t and the WACC is increased by the product LTVti.
How much the imposition of the tax penalty raises the WACC depends on how much households
change LTV in response to the loss of deductibility. The more households reduce LTV, the less the cost is
increased and thus the less will be the reduction in homeownership and housing demand. (Also, the less
revenue the government will gain by imposing the tax penalty.) Estimating the LTV response is the primary
purpose of this paper.
During the last quarter century, the mortgage interest deduction in the UK has been limited in two
ways. First, in 1974 the deduction was restricted to that on a £25,000 mortgage (and the deductibility of
interest on other household debt was eliminated). In 1983, the limit was raised to £30,000; the median UK
house price level had nearly tripled to £29,400 since 1974. Subsequently the limit was never again raised in
spite of rising house prices (the median tripled again to £87,300 in 1999). As can be seen in Table 1A, by
1988-91 about half of the new mortgage originations were above the limit and by 1995-98 two-thirds were.
Second, the maximum tax rate at which interest could be deducted was cut from the 40 percent maximum
income tax rate to 25 percent in 1992, to 20 percent in 1994, to 10 percent in 1995, and finally to zero in
1999. Given that there were only two household income tax brackets during this period, 25 and 40 percent,

6

after 1993 no household paying taxes could deduct mortgage interest at their full marginal income tax rate
(see Table 1B).
Of the ceiling and tax rate maximums, the former has been far more important for new borrowers
who have reasonably high initial loan-to-value ratios (the average of our sample is about 0.75). With a
median house price in 1995-98 of £60,000 to £70,000 outside the London/Southeast area and £85,000 to
£115,000 in London and the Southeast, most households had initial loans above the £30,000 mortgage limit
and thus could not deduct interest at the margin.
Figure 1 illustrates how the debt tax penalty varies with loan size. Tax rates are on the vertical axis
and loan amount on the horizontal. The top line is a household’s marginal tax rate. Holding house value
constant, the larger is the mortgage loan, the more interest is deductible (unless the loan is above the ceiling,
Lc), but the larger are the household’s taxable investments and thus the higher is its taxable interest income.
As long as the ceiling isn’t binding, taxable income is at least roughly independent of loan size. But when
the loan exceeds the ceiling, the larger is the loan (and thus taxable investments), the higher is the
household’s taxable income. At some point the household could be pushed into a higher tax bracket, as the
shift from t1 to t2 illustrates.

The dashed tt line in the figure indicates the lower maximum tax rate introduced in 1993 at which
mortgage interest on the loan amount below the ceiling can be deducted. Of course, interest on the loan
above the ceiling is deductible at a zero rate. To summarize then, the tax penalty on loans above the ceiling
is the full tax rate, t; the penalty below the ceiling is the maximum of t-tt or zero (the latter for households
with t < tt). Before 1993, there was no penalty on loans below the ceiling.
Thus two tax penalty variables are needed to reflect possible UK limitations on interest deductibility.
The first captures the nondeductibility of interest on loans above the loan ceiling and is measured as the
product of the tax rate and the market interest rate. The second captures the effect of the lower tax rate at
which interest below the ceiling is deductible after 1992 and is measured as the product of max(t-tt, 0) and
the market interest rate.

Estimation Strategy
To disentangle the characteristics of borrowers that have loans above the ceiling from characteristics
that are caused by being above the ceiling, we first estimate a logit equation predicting whether or not the
borrower’s loan amount exceeds the ceiling and then use the predicted probability that the loan amount
exceeds the ceiling, rather than whether it actually does, in computation of the tax penalty variables for use in
the leverage estimation. This is an attempt to address the simultaneous determination of the tax penalty
facing the borrower and his/her loan to value ratio. Although similar variables appear in both the LTV
regression and the logit, we use different transformation of them in each. Combined with the non-linearity of
the logit and the non-linear way in which the predicted probability enters the LTV regression, the incidence
of multicolinearity between the tax variable and the other variables is minimized. The plausible signs and
magnitudes of coefficients, the stability of the regressions and the high t-ratios confirm that multicolinearity
is not a problem (Greene, 1993, p. 267).
The logit equation takes the form:

8

CEIL(0/1) = f(income, ageDUMs, previous-owner, regionDUMs, yearDUMs),

(3)

where income and previous owner are both entered separately and interacted with the age dummies (<25, 2534, 35-44, 45-54, >54). Income and age give us a prediction of housing demand by the household; the
greater this demand, the more likely the loan is to exceed the ceiling. The impact of previous owner is
unclear. On the one hand, a household with equity from a previous house can use this to make a larger down
payment and thus would be less likely to have a loan above the ceiling. On the other hand, holding income,
age, etc. constant, the more equity from a previous house, the larger can be the house one purchases. The
regional dummies are introduced to reflect the impact of differences in regional house prices, and the year
dummies are introduced to capture the variation in the level of house prices across the years of origination.
The higher are house prices, the more likely is the ceiling to bind. Two equations are estimated, one for loan
originations in “low” house price regions and another for those in “high” house price regions (see the data
section).
The leverage estimation equation is:

lnLTV = g[basic determinants] - γ tiprob - β max(t-tt,0)i(1-prob)

(4)

where prob is the predicted probability of having a loan above the ceiling. We allow for the tax penalty
responses, γ and β, to vary with the borrower’s age. We denote the first tax penalty variable by T_above and
the second by T_below.
The household tax rate used in this estimation, t, must be independent of LTV. We compute the tax
rate on the first dollar of housing finance (opportunity cost of own equity invested unless the house is 100
percent debt financed) by adding an estimate of the income the household would have earned on the equity

9

invested in the house, i(HOUS-LOAN), to reported income. Given a progressive tax system, this is the
highest possible estimated tax rate.3

Data Base
We use the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) 5% random sample of mortgage loan origination
data, which has 20,000 to 40,000 loans per year. The underlying database contains all loans originated by
commercial banks, building societies and others. The data have been collected annually since 1974. The key
variables included in the CML data set are:
1. mortgage data: date, amount, type, initial rate, maturity, amortization pattern, and type of advance
(whether new mortgage, re-mortgage, further advance, or top-up loan).
2. dwelling data: purchase price, location of house, and dwelling characteristics
3. borrower data: number, income and age of borrowers; previous tenure of main borrower.
A wide variety of mortgages exist in the UK, with product varying by repayment (standard, interestonly and endowment), term, and adjustment period. The major types of repayment are interest-only, fully
amortizing, and endowment. The endowment mortgage is interest only, but the homeowner purchases a life
insurance policy with a constant monthly premium that presumably will cover repayment at the end of the
mortgage.4 The adjustment periods are monthly or fixed for various lengths. We have much detail on the
1995-98 loans, but less for 1988-91. Between the periods, the mean mortgage term fell from 23.4 to 20.5
years. The percentage of loans that were fully amortizing rose from 17 to 40 percent and interest-only
increased from less than 4 to 19 percent. Endowment loans, on the other hand, fell from 62 to 37 percent. In
1995-98, two thirds of the loans were fully variable, while few were fixed for as long as five years.

We analyze new mortgage data (mortgages to finance house purchases) from 1988-91 and 1995-98.5
By dealing with house purchasers, we avoid the problems of controlling for or estimating how long it will
take existing owners to adjust their leverage level in response to changes in interest deductibility (Ling and
McGill, 1998). The two time periods differ both in levels of house price (percent of loans over £30,000) and
in the debt tax penalty. During 1995-98, mortgage interest on loans below the £30,000 ceiling was
deductible at the 10 percent rate (t*=0.1), rather than the marginal income tax rate of most households. Thus
the tax rate penalty was either 0.3 or 0.15 for households with loans below the ceiling versus 0.4 or 0.25 for
households above the ceiling. During the 1988-91 period, the tax penalty varied from zero for households
with loan size less than the ceiling to the highest marginal tax rate of households with loan size greater than
the ceiling. Given that the tax penalty was less dependent on whether one is above or below the ceiling in
1995-98 than in 1988-91, estimates from the latter period will be less dependent on the accuracy of the
estimated logit than estimates from the earlier period.
Figure 2 plots constant-quality UK house prices for 10 regions over the period 1980 to 1998. Prices
grew steadily (nearly 10 percent per annum) during the 1970s and 1980s and were relatively flat during the
1990s.6 At all times prices in London and the Southeast are significantly greater than those in the rest of the
UK, and during the late 1980s prices in the Southwest and East Angelica were also relatively high. Loans
from these four areas are designated the high price group and loans from the other regions are labelled the
low price group during the 1988-91 period. Only London and the Southeast are classified as high house
price areas during the 1995-98 period. Because households in high house price areas are far more likely to
have loans above the £30,000 ceiling, we estimate separate logit equations for data in the high and low price

5

In 1988 the deductibility of interest on loans for renovation was eliminated, as was the ability of both
members of an unmarried couple to deduct interest on loans of up to £30,000 (removing a then existing
“marriage tax penalty” by increasing the tax on non-marrieds). Prior to 1988 it is difficult to determine
whether a multiple-adult household faced a £30,000 or £60,000 fully deductible ceiling.
6
The movement in real house prices is substantially different. In particular, real prices cycled sharply during
the 1972-76 and 1985-93 periods and otherwise grew at a fairly steady 2.5 percent between 1970 and 1997.
This 2.5 percent barely exceeds the two percent drift in the U.S. that Hendershott and Thibodeau (1990)
attribute to new houses being of higher quality than old and old being renovated. That is, median house price
inflation exceeds constant-quality house price inflation by two percent annually.
11

areas. Because we believe it especially important to analyze samples with wide variation in the debt tax
penalty, we estimate a single equation for each period to explain household LTVs.
We restrict the data set in a number of ways. First, to exclude investment properties we delete loans
to finance houses not occupied by the borrower. Second, we delete observations owing to missing values for
some of the variables needed for the logit estimations. Third, we eliminate borrowers who are deemed likely
to have had their borrowing decision dictated by lender borrowing limits (borrowers who are at/near the
maximum allowable loan-to-value and/or loan-to-income ratios). Constrained borrowers are unlikely to be
able to respond to the tax penalty.
The deletion of credit-constrained borrowers involves three steps. First, we identify a clearly
unconstrained subset of borrowers. Second, we estimate housing demand functions for these households.
Third, we predict housing demand for the rest of the sample (the possibly constrained borrowers). Borrowers
with demand equal to or greater than that predicted are defined as unconstrained and added to the clearly
unconstrained to form our total sample. Sample selection effects were captured using the Heckman
estimation procedure. Here we discuss how the clearly unconstrained subset was identified. The housing
demand estimation is contained in the Appendix.
Figures 3 and 4 contain the distributions of loans by LTV between zero and unity (the top half) and
then between 0.8 and 1.0 (the bottom half) in our 1988-91 and 1995-98 samples (high and low priced regions
are similar). The concentration of borrowers at the 90 and especially 95 and 100 percent values in the earlier
period is obvious. This reflects both the increase in borrowing costs (required default insurance contracts) as
those values are exceeded and, for the 100 percent concentration for sure, the maximum loan that lenders will
make. The deregulation of financial institutions in the early 1980s had a major impact. In 1979, less than
four percent of loans with LTVs above 80 percent had LTVs over 95 percent and only 20 percent had loans
over 90 percent. In our full database, over a quarter of such loans had LTVs over 95 percent and two-thirds
had them above 90 percent.
Figure 4 suggests a tightening of the LTV maximum in the middle 1990s; very few loans with LTV
above 95 percent were originated in the 1995-98 period, while 15 percent of 1988-91 loans had LTVs of 100

12

percent. Nonetheless, in the later period 75 percent of loan originations had LTVs above 80%, versus only
57 percent in the 1988-91 period. That is, while there was a sharp reduction in 100% loans, credit was still
amply available.
Figure 5 gives the distributions of the sample with ratios of loan size to income between 1.5 and 3.5
for single earner households in 1988-91 (top half) and 1995-98 (bottom half). The distributions for high and
low house price areas are similar. As can be seen, the distribution falls off sharply after 3.0 in the first period
but remains high until 3.25 in the second. It appears that lending standards were loosened between the two
periods. Figure 6 gives the distributions for the loan-to-income ratio between 1.5 and 3.5 for multiple earner
households in 1988-91 (top half) and 1995-98 (bottom half). In both periods the distribution drops off
abruptly at 2.5, although significant numbers of borrowers obtain ratios up to 3.0 and some have ratios far
above 3.0.
The “certainly unconstrained” borrowers in our sample are defined as those with LTVs below 0.89
and acceptable loan-to-income ratios. Based upon the above analysis, different loan-to-income constraints
were applied for single and multiple earner households. In 1988-91 we restrict the sample to loan-to-income
ratios below 2.75 (single earners) and 2.4 (multiple earners). In 1995-98 we increase the limit for single
earners to 2.9, but maintain the 2.4 for multiple earners.
Table 2 presents summary data on our samples and how they have been produced. For each of the
two house price groups for the two time periods we report both the number of loans we define as certainly
unconstrained and the additional number we estimate to be unconstrained. As can be seen, we drop roughly
45 percent of the sample as we move from the logit estimation to the LTV estimation. For the unconstrained
borrowers we list the percent (1) with loans above the £30,000 ceiling, (2) made to previous owners, and (3)
made to multiple-earner households, as well as the percentage distribution by age class.
Not surprisingly, the percentage of loans exceeding the £30,000 ceiling is greater in high than low
price areas and in 1995-98 (especially in low price areas) than in 1988-91. The age distribution of borrowers
is similar in high and low price areas, but shifts significantly over time with the share of loans to under age
25 borrowers falling and that to ages 35-44 rising between 1988-91 and 1995-98. In both low and high

13

house price regions, the share of loans to under age 25 borrowers was 12 percent in 1988-91. By 1995-98
this share was only nine (low price) and five (high price) percent. This shift at least partially reflects the
ageing of the baby-boomers. The percentage of loans to previous owners in low price areas fell by five
percentage points, while that in high price areas rose by four percentage points. The latter is consistent with
the sharp drop in loans to those under age 25.

Estimation
1988-91
Table 3 reports the fit and the estimates of the logit predicting whether a borrower’s loan is above or
below the £30,000 limit. As can be seen, 78 and 82 percent of the sample, respectively, are predicted
correctly in the low and high price areas. The distributions of the predicted probability of being over the
ceiling and of the associated tax penalty variable are shown in Figure 7. The predicted probability
distribution is flat through about 0.7 and then rises shapely. The rise reflects the high level of nominal house
prices in the Southeast regions. The variation in the predicted tax penalty variable is large. While the
variable is less than 0.03 for over two-thirds of the sample, it ranges from 0.045 to 0.06 for a quarter of the
sample.
Table 4 reports the regressions of lnLTV. The adjusted R2 is 0.29. The key coefficient is, of course,
that on the tax penalty variable, T_above. This coefficient is –6.4 with a t-ratio of 29. For high tax rate
(40%) households with a loan over £30,000, and thus paying a tax penalty, lnLTV is reduced by –6.4(.12)(.4)
= -0.294. For low tax rate (25%) households, the reduction is -6.4(.12)(.25) = -0.192. Assuming an LTV of
0.85 in the absence of the penalty, the LTV would be 0.63 to 0.70 with the penalty. If the LTV were 0.65 in
the absence of the penalty, the LTV would be 0.48 to 0.54 with the penalty. That is, leverage would be
reduced by 17 (low tax bracket borrowers) to 26 (high tax bracket borrowers) percent.
The elasticities of LTV with respect to primary income and secondary income (income is measured
in thousands), respectively, are 0.275 and 0.068. Higher income households demand larger houses and

14

choose to finance them with relatively greater leverage.7 The lower leverage elasticity with respect to second
incomes likely reflects the ability of households with second incomes to obtain down payment support from
two families rather than one (we do not know if the individuals in the household are married). Previous
ownership also reduces leverage, although much less for younger households. For households over age 34,
the reduction in lnLTV is 0.28. For under age 25 households, the reduction is 0.09.
Table 5 reports some calculations indicating the predicted variation in LTVs across three age groups
(25 to 34, 45 to 54, and 55 plus) with average single incomes for their age class, with and without a
secondary earner with average income, and separately for first-time and previous owners. The calculations
are for the dropped year (1991) and region (London) and assume no debt tax penalty. The first two rows
give background data on mean incomes of first and second earners for the age groups. The next three
(numbered) rows give the log of these mean incomes and mean LTVs. Incomes rise from ages 25-34 to ages
45-54 and then decline for those over age 55.
LTVs decline sharply with age, 30 to 35 percentage points as age increases from 25-34 to over 55.
This is the type of decline commonly seen in developed economies, but note that this decline is for new
purchases, not for homeowners generally. The predicted LTVs based on the mean income levels are four
(over age 55) to ten (25 to 34) percentage points higher for multiple earner households than for single earner
households. Finally, the LTV is about 10 percentage points lower for previous owners.

1995-98
The basic logits and lnLTV results are in Tables 6 and 7. Whether a borrower’s loan is above or
below the £30,000 ceiling is correctly predicted by the logit 83 to 86 percent of the time. Figures 8 and 9,
respectively, plot the distributions of the predicted probability of being over the ceiling and of the associated
tax penalty variables T_above and T_below. Owing to the rise in nominal house prices, the probability
distribution is now strongly skewed to the right. Half of the sample has a probability greater than 0.8. The

7

On the other hand, the existence of a second earner in the household reduces leverage (lnLTV is lowered by
0.48). The level of second income at which leverage is unaffected is obtained by solving 0.48 =
ln(INCL)*0.068. The solution is £1095; for second incomes below this level, leverage declines.
15

tax penalty variables generally have lower values because the level of interest rates declined from 0.12 to
0.07. The right skewness of the probability of being over the ceiling results in a right skewness in T_above
and a left skewness in T-below.
The adjusted R2 for the lnLTV regressions is 0.31. The previous owner results are similar to those
for 1988-91, but the income variables have considerably smaller effects and age coefficients are smaller.
This is illustrated by the calculations in Table 8, which assume no penalty and are based on London and
1998. The simulated declines from age 25-34 to 55+ are 23 percentage points for previous owners and 17
percentage points for nonowners, 10 to 15 points less than those in Table 5.
But the actual decline from age 25-34 to 55+ in the 1995-98 data was 0.32, greater than the 0.20
decline based on the 1988-91 data. This greater decline is due to the more widespread tax penalty on the use
of home mortgage debt – a penalty that existed whether one’s loan was above or below the £30,000 ceiling –
and a larger estimated response to it. The two tax penalty coefficients in the first column of Table 7 are both
statistically significant with the expected negative sign. The response to the penalty when above the ceiling,
T_above, is more than double that in the 1988-91 period, -14.1 with t-ratio of 29, versus -6.4. The response
when below the ceiling is much larger, -62.7 with a t-ratio of 41.
Because of the multiple tax-penalty coefficients, the interpretation of the tax penalty variables is
more complicated. Above the ceiling, the penalty is t, below the ceiling it is t-0.1 (both times i = 0.07). For
households in the 40 percent tax bracket, the lnLTV response to removal of interest deductibility is either
-62.7(.07)(.3) – below the ceiling – or -14.1(.07)(.4) – above the ceiling, i.e., -1.62 or -0.39. For households
in the 25 percent tax bracket, the estimated response is either –62.7(.07)(.15) or -14.1(.07)(.25), i.e., -0.66 or
-0.25. That is, the response (reduction in lnLTV) is 2.5 to 4 times as great for those below the ceiling than
those above. Given that loans below the ceiling are smaller (a half to a fifth on average), the percentage
declines can be achieved with far smaller loan payoffs.
One possible reason for the larger responses to T_above in 1995-98 than in 1988-91 (-14.1 versus
-6.4) is the decline in importance of under age 35 borrowers in the sample noted in Table 2 (from 54 to 48
percent of the sample in low price areas and from 53 to 42 percent in high price areas). If older households

16

with greater wealth are more sensitive to the tax penalty, we would expect the average sample response to
increase as the sample ages. To test the hypothesis that older households are more responsive, we run a
regression with each tax penalty variable entered both by itself and times a dummy variable equaling one for
households over age 34 and zero for younger households. The results are in Table 9. These interaction
variables, as well as the tax penalty variables themselves are expected to have negative coefficients. The
four coefficients are large, negative, and have t-ratios ranging from 7 to 29.8
Table 10 reports the impacts of removing the deductibility of mortgage interest for borrowers under
age 35 and 35 and older and with loans above and below £30,000. The tax variable coefficients and t-ratios
are in the first two rows of the table, and row 3 gives the cumulative coefficients (“all” for under age 35 and
the sum of the “all” and “over 34” coefficients for over age 34). The first two columns are for loans over
£30,000 and the third and fourth for under £30,000. Rows 4-7 report the distribution of households and
average loan amounts for these household groups separately by low (largely 25 percent) and high (40
percent) tax brackets. Note that high tax bracket households are disproportionately older – they are almost
twice as likely to be over age 34, while low tax bracket households are more likely to be under age 35 – and
that the average loan size of high tax bracket households with loans over £30,000 is nearly twice that of low
tax bracket households. Because high tax bracket and older households respond more than low tax bracket
and younger households, this increases the aggregate response to removal of deductibility.
The impacts of removing deductibility are computed in two ways. First, we shift the probability of
being over the £30,000 ceiling from zero to one, i.e., we use the coefficients from the first two columns.
Second, we shift the probability of being under the ceiling from zero to one, using the much larger
coefficients from the second two columns. The percentage reduction in leverage from removal of
deductibility is (1 – epen)*100, where pen is the product of the tax variable coefficient, the interest rate (0.07),
and either the tax rate (loans over £30,000) or the tax rate less 0.1 (loans below £30,000). For those with
loans above the £30,000 ceiling the reduction ranges from 19 to 29 percent for those under age 35 and from

8

The age interaction tax penalty variable was tested with the 1988-91 subsample, but its coefficient was
insignificantly different from zero. For 1995-98, an under age 25 interaction was tested in addition to the
over age 34 interaction. The under age 25 coefficients were positive, as expected, but small.
17

23 to 34 percent for those 35 and older. These percentage declines are, on average, about the same as the 17
to 26 percent declines based on the 1988-91 sample, even though the level of interest rates was only 7
percent in 1995-98 versus the 12 percent in 1988-91 and thus the tax penalty was less.
The declines in leverage for those with loans less than the ceiling (columns three and four) are much
larger, 40 to 65 percent for young households and 53 to 78 for older households. Given that we are dealing
here with smaller volume loans, the percentage declines can be achieved with smaller loan payoffs. The
larger responses are because the greater estimated response to the tax penalty outweighs the smaller penalty
(the tax rate less 0.1, rather than the full tax rate). Of course the fact that these loans are small means that
even these large responses are not very important to the aggregate response. In fact, the weighted average
LTV response for the eight household groups is a 30 percent decline.
How much government tax revenue would be gained by elimination of tax deductibility depends on
who (high or low tax rate payers) is repaying the debt, as well as how much is repaid. Say that the “static”
(no behavioral responses) estimate of the revenue lost owing to deductibility is £10 billion and that mortgage
debt declines by 30 percent in response to the removal of deductibility. The government revenue pickup will
be significantly less than £7 billion because high tax bracket households would repay relatively more debt
than low tax bracket households. Not only do higher tax bracket households respond about twice as much
because their tax penalty is greater, but higher tax bracket households have loans that are almost twice as
large. The response of older households with the same tax penalty is about 20 percent greater than that of
younger households, probably owing to their having greater wealth relative to income.

Summary and Conclusion
We analyze over 117,000 UK loan originations split about equally between the 1988-91 and 1995-98
periods. Because the tax penalty to using debt varied during these periods with whether a borrower had a
loan above or below £30,000, we first estimate logit equations explaining whether the loan exceeded £30,000
and then use the predicted probability of the borrower’s loan exceeding this amount in computing our two tax
penalty variables. The variables represent the penalty per unit of debt if the loan is above £30,000 – the

18

product of the tax rate and the interest rate – or below – the product of the interest rate and the difference
between one’s marginal income tax rate and the rate at which mortgage interest is deductible.
We establish a major sensitivity of leverage to the debt tax penalty created for many households (for
all during the 1995-98 period) by the partial deductibility of mortgage interest. This sensitivity exists for
both time periods. Based on this, we can infer what the impact of removing the interest deduction would be
relative to having the full deduction. Because estimates for the latter period are less sensitive to the accuracy
of the logits used in computing the tax penalty variables, we view them as more credible. Our best estimate
is that leverage of those with loans over £30,000 would decline by 19 to 34 percent, the larger percentage
applying to older (over age 34) borrowers in the 40 percent tax bracket. For those with smaller loans (under
the £30,000 ceiling), the estimates are far larger – a 40 to 78 percent decline. Because 80 percent of loans
are above £30,000, the aggregate decline would be about 30 percent.
Our analysis is based on new loans for home purchase. Homeowners with existing loans will also
pay down their loans. Because these households are older and many will have smaller loans, they are likely
to be more sensitive to removal of the mortgage interest deduction (although effective prepayment penalties
would make this response less/slower in the UK than in the U.S.). On the other hand, we have excluded 45
percent of new loans on the grounds that the borrowers may have been income or wealth constrained. These
borrowers would be less sensitive to the tax penalty than unconstrained borrowers. Overall, our estimates of
a reduction in the average UK leverage suggest a smaller – say 25 to 30 percent response than the 40 percent
found in earlier studies of Australia and U.S. data.
The tax revenue gained by the government from removal of the home mortgage interest deduction
will be less than the product of the average tax rate at which interest is deducted and the amount of debt not
repaid for a variety of reasons. First, the average tax rate will decline because high tax bracket households
will repay disproportionately larger fractions of their debt owing to their having a larger tax penalty and
having greater relative wealth to repay debt. Second, removal of deductibility will lower the volume of
single-family housing to be financed by raising the weighted average user cost of capital (WACC), although
the debt response mitigates the rise in WACC, our concluding topic.

19

Initially assume full deductibility, a mortgage rate of 8 percent and an after-tax risk premium of one
percent. Consider two households, one in the 40 percent tax bracket and the other in the 25 percent bracket.
Their WACCs – (1-t)8 + 1 – are, respectively, 5.8 and 7 percent. Without deductibility, their WACCs rise to
(1-t)8 + 1 + LTVt8. Table 11 gives the WACC for these households assuming alternative initial LTVs – 0.9
and 0.7 – and alternative percentage declines in leverage in response to the removal of interest deductibility –
20, 30 and 40.
Of course, with no decline in LTV, the increases are the largest, being greater the higher the initial
LTV. The percentage decline in LTV acts as a direct offset to the percentage increase in WACC – if LTV
declines by 30 percent, the increase in the WACC is only 70 percent of what it otherwise would have been.
Consider the 0.9 LTV. With no change in leverage, removal of the deduction increases the WACC by 1.8 to
2.9 percentage points or 26 to 50 percent (the larger numbers for households in the 40 percent tax bracket).
With a 30 percent decline in leverage, the increase in the WACC is reduced by 30 percent or a half to a full
percentage point.
Changes in household leverage would significantly offset the negative impact of the removal of
interest deductibility on house prices, housing consumption and home ownership. To illustrate, consider the
extreme case where all of the increase in WACC causes a reduction in housing consumption. In the
appendix we estimate that the elasticity of housing demand with respect to the WACC is –0.25 to –0.4. Thus
if the WACC rises by 30 percent, the decline in housing consumption would be 7.5 to 12 percent. On the
other hand, if leverage adjustments offset half of the rise in WACC, the decline in consumption would be
only 4 to 6 percent.
At the other extreme, the rise in WACC could simply lower real house prices. In this case, a 30
percent rise in the WACC translates directly into a 30 percent price decline. Thus a halving of the increase in
WACC would half the price decline. A mixture of consumption and price declines would be expected, but
the declines would, according to our estimates, by reduced by about a third by the leverage response.

Appendix: Determining Credit Constrained Borrowers
The LTV functions were estimated using a five-step procedure applied separately to each time
period. The last two steps were discussed in detail in the text and so it is the first three steps, relating to the
treatment of rationed borrowers, that is our focus here. Before detailing each step, it is worth summarizing
the overall strategy. The goal is to develop a methodology for identifying unrationed borrowers. We first
specified a subsample of borrowers who we believe to be clearly unrationed given their loan-to-value and
loan-to-income ratios. We then estimated a housing demand function for this group of borrowers and used
this function to estimate the demand for each household in the rest of the sample and compared it to their
actual demand. If actual demand equaled or exceeded predicted demand, the household was added to our
unrationed sample, on which our final LTV function was estimated. Sample selection effects were captured
using the Heckman estimation procedure. This method translates into a five step procedure.
Step 1: Estimate ψbt

ψbt is the predicted probability that the borrower’s loan will be less than or equal to the £30,000
ceiling on tax deductibility. This probability is needed in the construction of the user cost of capital variable
in the demand regressions estimated in step 2.

ψbt was estimated by running logits (dependent variable = whether or not the borrowers loan
exceeded the £30,000 limit) on a subsample of clearly unrationed borrowers, selected as those borrowers in
the 1988-91 (1995-98) period with a loan to value ratio less than or equal to 0.89 (0.89) and either a loan to
primary earner income ratio less than or equal to 2.75 (2.9) or a loan to total income ratio less than or equal
to 2.4 (2.4). This resulted in a basic sample of unrationed borrowers in 1988-91 (1995-98) of 44,506
(38,836). Separate logits were run for low and high house price regions.
Step 2: Estimate unconstrained housing consumption
The housing demand equation followed Hendershott and Pryce (2002),

lnHCb = β0 + β1lnMCHb + β 2lnYb + β 3 AGEb + β 4AGEb2,

21

where lnHC is the log of housing consumption, lnMCH is the log of the marginal cost of housing, lnYb is the
log of total income, AGE is the age of the main borrower, lnYb is the log of total income, the βi are the
estimated coefficients, and the subscript b refers to household b. We adopt Goodman and Kawai’s (1982)
method for calculating HC, defining it as the actual household house price (times a constant imputed rental
rate that is absorbed in the constant term when logs are taken) divided by the constant-quality price. The
latter is estimated using hedonic regressions of price on housing attributes and quarter dummies, run
separately for each of the ten regions and each year.
The marginal cost of housing was calculated as, MCHt = UCCt( P̂ rt /RPIt), where RPI is monthly
retail price index, and UCC is the user cost of capital, defined as the mortgage interest rate i, less the tax
deductible component τ, plus the rate of depreciation (assumed to be 0.01 for all households), plus property
taxes (0.02), and less expected capital gains, π*rt:

UCC = (1 - τbt)it + 0.03 - 0.3π*rt.
The expected rate of nominal house price change, π *rt, was estimated separately for each region
using the backward-looking expectations approach of Ermisch, Findlay and Gibb (1996). That is, ∆ P̂ rt was
regressed on ∆ P̂ rt-1 from 1979 quarter one through to 1998 quarter four, where ∆ P̂ rt is the four quarter
difference in the price index, ∆ P̂ rt = P̂ rt - P̂ rt-4, and the estimated parameters used to forecast expected
house price inflation for each region in each quarter).
The constant quality price house price index used for these calculations was constructed using the
selling price and dwelling characteristics information in the CML Survey of Mortgage Lenders data. For
each of the ten regions region, separate regressions were run on selling price for each year of the data since
1979 (explanatory variables = number of rooms, number of rooms squared, age of dwelling dummies, type of
dwelling dummies, room-type interactive terms, and quarterly dummies on selling price) thus allowing
marginal valuations of characteristics to change from year to year. These regressions (200 in total) had an

22

average adjusted R2 of 0.48 based on samples of around 1,500 depending on the region and the time period.
We then predicted value of a constant quality dwelling (a five bedroom, semi-detached, post war dwelling)
for each region in each quarter = P̂ rt.
A weight of 0.3 was applied to π *rt following Ermisch, Findlay and Gibb (1996). The tax deductible
component τ, was computed by multiplying the borrower’s marginal income tax rate Tb by ψbt, the predicted
probability that the borrower’s loan would be less than or equal to the £30,000 ceiling on tax deductibility
(computed in Step 1). As in the final LTV regressions, the household tax rate used in this estimation, Tb, was
computed as the tax rate on the first pound of housing purchased by adding an estimate of the income the
household would have earned on the equity invested in purchasing the house to reported income.
The housing demand regression was run on the subsample of easily identifiable unrationed
borrowers and the estimated parameters (listed in Table A) were used to predict unrationed housing demand.
Missing values reduced the basic unrationed sample in 1988-91 (1995-98) by 3,065 (7,933) observations to
41,441 (30,903) cases. The estimated income elasticity is about 0.6 and the price elasticity is –0.25 (199598) to –0.4 (1988-91).
Step 3: Compare actual and predicted demands for households in the remaining sample
If actual demand (as recorded in the data) equals or exceeds predicted demand (the antilog of the
predicted values from the demand regressions in Table A), the household was added to our unrationed
sample.
Step 4: Predict the probability of exceeding the ceiling
The logits were re-run on the enlarged sample and the estimated parameters used to predict the
probability of exceeding the ceiling. This probability was used to construct the tax penalty variable in the
LTV regression.
Step 5: Run the LTV regression
Finally, the LTV regression was run on the expanded unconstrained sample using the Heckman
procedure to account for selection effects.
