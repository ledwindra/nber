    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reviews recent developments in macro and finance on the relationship between financial risk and the real economy. We focus on three specific topics: the term structure of uncertainty, time variation - and specifically the long-term decline - in the variance risk premium, and time variation in conditional skewness. We also introduce two new data series: implied volatility from one-day options on grains for the period 1906-1936, and on cliquet options, which provide insurance against single-day crashes on the S&P 500, both of which give some context to the recent rise in trade in extremely short-dated options. Finally, we discuss new avenues for future research.\n\n",
