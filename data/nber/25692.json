    "abstract": "\n\nWe explore the idea that judgment by representativeness reflects the workings of episodic memory, especially interference.  In a new laboratory experiment on cued recall, participants are shown two groups of images with different distributions of colors.  We find that i) decreasing the frequency of a given color in one group significantly increases the recalled frequency of that color in the other group, ii) for a fixed set of images, different cues for the same objective distribution entail different interference patterns and different probabilistic assessments. Selective retrieval and interference may offer a foundation for the representativeness heuristic, but more generally for understanding the formation of probability judgments from experienced statistical associations.\n\n",
