HOW MANY MONIES? A
GENETIC APPROACH TO FINDING
OPTIMUM CURRENCY AREAS

ABSTRACT
Recent moves towards greater monetaiy integration in Western Europe - and

disintegration

in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - have rekindled interest in the theoretical and

empirical aspects of optimal currency areas (OCA). In this paper, we examine the marginal
benefit of increasing the number of currency unions within a given geographical area. We look
at six regions; the United States, Europe, the G7, the CFA zone, the FSU and the world at large.

Our results suggest that (i) contiguous monetary unions are typically dominated by noncontiguous unions; (ii) neither Europe nor the United States form an optimum currency area, for

both regions the costs of adopting a single currency exceeds estimates of the transaction cost

savings; (iii) Germany and the United States will almost never find it to their (economic)
advantage to join monetary unions.

1 Introduction
Recent moves towards greater monetary integration in Western Europe — and disintegra-

tion in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union —

have

rekindled interest in the

theoretical' and empirical2 aspects of optimal currency areas (OCA).3 Much of the new
empirical literzture applies the criteria developed by Mundell (1961), McKinnon (1963),
and Kenen (1969) to compare a candidate region to an existing monetary union, the most
fashionable example being the comparison between the EMS countries and the US states,
where the Maastricht signatories are typically judged to be an inferior candidate for a mon-

etary union compared to the US states. While interesting in their own right, these studies
are, by construction, restricted to accepting or rejecting the proposition that a given region

constitutes a "better" candidate for a single currency than the chosen benchmark currency
area. There is however no reason to believe that for a region with n countries the optimal
monetary arrangement will be either a single currency or ii independent currencies. Among

the twelve European Union countries, for instance, the optimal configuration may involve
two, or three, currencies rather than either one or twelve.
To allow for this possibility, we adopt a more continuous approach towards determining

OCAs in this paper. Based on an evaluation principle developed below, we determine the

optimal grouping of n countries into any given number of monetary unions k, with k
ranging from 1 to n. We then relate macroeconomic performance to the number ofunions,

thus deriving an estimate of the marginal contribution of an additional currency. The
approach yields two insights. First, we are able to determine optimal membership patterns

for any given number of monetary unions. Second, we are able to determine

for any

given country group — how many monies are needed to capture most of the benefits of
exchange rate flexibility.
We address these questions for a variety of country groupings. We begin with the United
States — long suspected not to be an optimal currency area [Mundell (1961)}. While the

abandonment of the common dollar scarcely seems imminent, the case allows identification

of state groups subject to similar shocks and permits a comparison with the regional struc'See for cxaxn'jie Casetla (1990), Meitz (1991), Aizenman and Flood (1993) and Bayoumi (1994).

ture of the Federal Reserve System. Next, we turn to a group of twenty European countries,
evaluating the relative merits of various monetary unions, and comparing them to the EMS

grouping. Third, we review recent proposals for greater stability of the exchange rates
among the G-7 countries.4 We interpret such proposals in an extreme form, and consider
the costs (in terms of foregone opportunities for macroeconomic stabilization) of adopting

common currtncies for the G-7. Our fourth and fifth cases are the states of the Former
Soviet Union, and the CFA countries. Finally, we turn to the world at large.
Answering the first question — the optimal groupings of countries for a given number
of monetary unions — is rather non-trivial: given current computing facilities, the number
of possible permutations of n countries into k groups of various sizes rules out a brute force

computation of the optimal arrangement. We instead use a variant of the genetic algorithm

optimization approach to compute the optimal groupings, and then vary the total number
of currency unions to find the marginal benefit of an additional currency.
Our general conclusions may be summarized briefly. First, there is typically little cor-

relation between geographical proximity and the optimal currency area groupings. Put
differently, restricting monetary unions to geographically contiguous areas implies significantly higher costs from foregoing the use of the exchange rate as an adjustment instrument.

Second, for most regions we consider, adopting a single currency would appear to entail
prohibitively high casts. For instance, in the case of the US States, the cost of maintaining

a single currency (ignoring the transactions benefits) amounts to some 2.5 percent of US
GDP per year - almost 150 billion current US $. The corresponding figures for the European countries, and for the Group of Seven major industrialized nations, are very similar, at
around 2.6 percent of their respective GD Ps. These are well in excess of transactions costs

benefits, as estimated by the European Commission, of 0.5 percent of GDP per year. On
the other hand, most of the stabilization benefits of independent currencies can be captured

by having relatively few currencies. With five currencies among the fifty US states, and
three currencies among the twelve European Union countries, the stabilization costs fall to

less than 1.5 percent of GDP. For the other regions we consider, the CFA countries, the
States of the Former Soviet Union, and the world at large, the costs of adopting a single
currency are sgnificant1y higher.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the theory

of optimal currency areas, and develops the theoretical framework for our empirical work.

Since the use of genetic algorithms is still quite rare in economics, section 3 provides an
overview of how such algorithms work. Section 4 reports the main empirical results for our

six data sets and section 5 concludes.

2 The Theory Of Optimal Currency Areas
The nominal exchange rate regime will only have real economic effects in the presence of

some form of nominal rigidity. If, as is typically assumed, nominal wages are downward
sticky, then changes in the price level will elicit a corresponding change in the real wage,
and can bring the economy closer to full employment following an adverse productivity
shock, or — in a world with multiple goods — a change in the demand for that country's

output. To the extent that shocks impinke upon countries asymmetrically, however, the
desired changes in the price level will differ across countries, and the nominal exchange rate

will need to adjust. Adopting a common currency (or, equivalently, an irrevocably fixed

exchange rate) thus limits the stabilization scope of monetary policy to shocks that are
symmetric to the countries in the monetary union.
A simple macroeconomic model can be used to sketch this idea. It bears emphasizing,
however, that the main results hold very generally, and few of the specific assumptions —
except for the nominal wage rigidity — are required. Let output in country i at time t be

given by:

Q=e°L

(1)

where O is a random shock, L is labor employed in period t, and 0 < /3 < 1 is the
share of labor. Nominal wages are downward sticky . A simple formulation is to assume
that the (log) of the nominal wage is set in order to obtain labor market equilibrium based
on information available in period t — 1:
5Alternatively, one can assume that nominal wages are pre-determined (and thus both upward and
downward sticky). Such a model gives very similar results if the monetary authorities are assumed to want
to minimize the v'.riance of output.

5

log(w) — E_1log(p) = E...1O + (/3 — 1)log([)

(2)

Since wages are downward sticky, the ex post level of labor demand depends on whether

the realized productivity shock was lower than expected. if there was a positive productivity

shock,9'> E_1O', nominal wages are assumed to adjust, and full-employment prevails. In
the face of a negative productivity shock, however, nominal wages are rigid so that ex post

labor demand .'

is given by:

+ (/3 — 1)1og(l)

= log(w) — log(p) = E_1O + (/3 — l)log(I) — 1og(p)

(3)

If the country is not in a monetary union, the monetary authorities can alter the price
level in order to cut real wages following a negative productivity shock, 0 — E19 < 0, in
order to emulate the flexible nominal wages:

log(p) — E_1 1og(p) = E_19

so that full-employment always prevails, 1 =

1,

and:

Q=e°L'

(5)

The change in the domestic price level will be associated with a change in the nominal
exchange rate, unless the foreign country experiences the same shock. For instance, if two

countries, i and j, produce the same good, then purchasing power parity should hold:
log(e) — E_1 log(eg) = [log(p) — E1_1 log(p)] — [1og(p) — E_1 log(pflj

(6)

= —(e —e)
and country i's exchange rate wifi need to depreciate when it suffers a larger negative

shock to its output than does country j. It bears emphasizing that the assumption of PPP
is not essential; a model with multiple goods and real exchange dynamics will give very
similar results (see for example Bayoumi (1994)).

Suppose, instead, that the two countries have formed a monetary union, so that the
nominal exchinge rate must be constant. If the average shock to the members of the union

6

in period t is , then log(p) = log(p) = —(g, so that the er-post labor demand is given
by:6

r/T= (_t)/(1_P)

and output, when the country belongs to the union, , is givert 1y:

Therefore, when (e —

(8)

<0, country, i, suffers an output loss equal to:

V = [1 — e(_)/(1_/)]Qi

ifet <

(9)

where

is the average shock to the currency union to which country i belongs. For a
region with n countries, one possible welfare function is the total cost of forming currency
unions:

L=>L

(10)

While the welfare function (10) is certainly reasonable, it is noteworthy that it has the
property of treating a "dollar" in each country equally, regardless of the per capita GDP of

that country. In effect, this means that when there relatively few independent currencies,

larger countries should be allocated their own currency while smaller countries share a
common currency. The reason is simple: when a large country suffers a negative shock the

cost, in terms of foregone output, of not allowing the exchange rate to adjust will be very
high. From a global perspective, therefore, such countries should maintain an independent

monetary policy. Smaller countries, in contrast, can share a common currency because,

even though their shocks may be large relative to their own GDP, the total output cost
from a global perspective may be quite modest.

The model is obviously highly simplified, but it provides a basis for an empirical assessment of the cost of adopting common currencies, and for identifying which countries

would be the optimal partners in a region with (parametrically given) n. countries and k
Generalizing to currency unions with n members is straight-forward. In our empirical work, we use the

GD? weighted average of the shock. Thus monetary policy in the union is assumed to be determined by a
GD P-weighted average of the desired policies of the members.

currencies. The optimal country groups are likely to be quite robust to changes in the
specification of the model since they depend only upon the commonality of shocks to the

monetary union. The extent to which the actual costs associated with the limitation will
coincide with the model's predictions depends upon five factors.

First, rigidity of the nominal exchange rate only matters if nominal wages are indeed
rigid. Empirical evidence on wage rigidity is mixed, and differs across countries. Bruno and

Sachs [19851, for instance, argue that nominal wages are sticky in the United States, while

in Europe, wages tend to be somewhat more sticky in real terms. Furthermore, nominal
wazes might be rigid with respect to labor market conditions (which mainly affect non-

union membei, or "outsiders") but not nominal exchange rate movements (which affect
the real living standards of "insiders" as-well) [Bofinger (1994)].

Second, exchange rate flexibility only works to the extent that nominal exchange rate

movements reflect changes in fundamentals. Two decades of empirical studies have —
by and large — failed to uncover such stable links between exchange rate movements and

changes in fundamentals (Meese [1990]) This literature, of course, typically refers to floating

exchange rates: a regime with fixed, but adjustable parities, may result in desirable real
exchange rate changes through nominal exchange rate movements.
Third, a monetary union will result in poorer macroeconomic performance only if shocks

affect countries asynmetrically. This is the criterion stressed by Mundell (1961) in his sem-

inal article, and underlies both the theoretical model and the empirical approach adopted
here. Yet it should be recognized that the correlation structure of macroeconomic shocks
need not remain invariant to the monetary regime. To the extent that adoption of a single
currency alters the degree of exchange rate uncertainty, new patterns of trade, investment,

and production may emerge. The EU Commission, for instance, asserts that "EMU will
reduce the incidence of country-specific shocks" [EU Commission (1990:11)]. In contrast,

Giersch (1949), Myrdal (1957) and Scitovsky (1958) argue that adoption of common cur-

rencies leads to (indeed, is partly motivated by) increased specialization to reap the full
benefits of comparative advantage, an argument recently revived by Krugman (1993). The
point is hard to decide ex ante: while empirical studies contrasting the US states to Europe

indeed find a considerably higher degree of specialization within the US, it is not evident
whether the common currency has been the primary cause.

Moreover, monetary (and exchange rate) policy is only equipped to deal with shocks
8

to aggregate GDP or the entire traded sector. As Kenen (1969) notes, such aggregate
shocks may be of quite limited importance in well-diversified economies, so that monetary
policy loses much of its stabilization role regardless of whether the country joins a monetary
union. The empirical evidence of Stockman (1989) and DeGrauwe and Vanhaverbeke (1991)

suggests that industry-specific shocks are indeed of first-order magnitude, implying that the

nominal exchange rate may be a relatively ineffective stabilization tool.

Fourth, there may be alternative mechanisms for restoring macroeconomic balance in

adversely affected regions. If labor is mobile across members of the union, then unemployment can be eliminated by factor flows rather than changes in wage rates.7 There is

de jtlre labor mobility among the European Union countries and among the states of the
United States. Whereas actual labor mobility seems very high in the United States [Blan-

chard and Katz (1992)], cultural, linguistic, and other barriers (such as immediate access
to social services or pensions) limit the de facto mobility in Europe [Eichengreen (1993)].

Finally, fiscal policy may be an important means of temporarily alleviating the effects of
macroeconomic shocks when the exchange rate realignment is not a policy option. Sachs
and Sala-i-Martin [19911 argue that larger federal fiscal transfers improve the OCA quality

of the US vis a vis Europe. 8
And fifth, the extent to which real wages need to adjust will depend upon the elasticity

of the demand function for the country's output. The assumption that all goods are perfect
substitutes is, of course, an extreme one though perhaps not implausible when considering
unions of fairly homogenous members. Most of these five factors will tend to reduce the costs

of foregoing the possibility of using monetary and exchange rate policy for macroeconomic

stabilization. The model developed above, and the empirical results presented below, may

thus be considered an upper-bound on the costs of adopting common currencies among
union members.
These costs — actual or putative — of adopting a common currency, must be compared
Tin principle, capital mobility can also alleviate country-specific shocks. As stressed by Masson and
Taylor [1994), however, an important distinction needs to be drawn between llnancial &nd physical capital

mobility. Financial capital can be used to smooth consumption when output is temporarily low. Raising
output in depressed regions, however, requires physical capital mobility — or capital accumulation — and
this process may be quite slow. If real wages are too high for labor markets to clear, moreover, there may
be little incentive for capital to flow to the region anyway.

to the benefits of a monetary union. As Mundell (1963) asserts, a common currency reduces everyday transactions costs. Not surprisingly, these transactions costs are difficult to

measure and quantify. For the case of the EMS, the Commission of the European Union

estimates that the total benefits from a move to a single currency will be in the order of

"around 0.5% of GDP (ECU 13 to 19 billion per year) for the Community as a whole"
[European Commission (1990:21)]. The breakdown of these saving is given in table 1. Cor-

responding estimates for other geographical regions are not re.dily available. Taking the
Commission's figures as a benchmark, however, it is unlikely that the lowered transactions
costs from moving to a single currency would exceed 1% of the total GDP of the countries

in the candidate region.

It seems reasonable to assume that the volume of transactions — and thus the potential

saving of transactions costs — will be increasing in the proximity of the members of the

union. Indeed, most proposals for monetary unions are for countries which are geographically proximate.9 There are, of course, several different forms of proximity: the distance

between closest borders, the distance between geographic centers or national capitals, as
well as concepts of linguistic, or cultural, proximity. One definition of geographic proximity
'With some notable exceptions: Panama and Liberia, for instance, have been on a formal dollar standard,
while

dollarization in some

Latin American countries, notably Bolivia, ls brought about a monetary

unification from below".

10

— which is adopted in our empirical work below — requires states to share a common

border (for islands, the nearest country can be used). This leads to the idea of contiguous
monetary unions; that is, unions in which each member shares a border with at least one
other member. As discussed below, the requirement of contiguity typically imposes bind-

ing constraints on the optimal allocation of countries across monetary unions, and raises
the welfare cost of foregone stabilization policy significantly. These higher costs must be
weighed against the greater saving on transactions costs that contiguous monetary unions
may deliver.

3 The Genetic Algorithm
As noted in the introduction, even for reasonably small numbers of countries, n, (the
countries in Lirope; the states of the US; or the countries in the world), the number of
possible groupings into k monetary unions (for k

1,n) , not necessarily of the same

size, renders a grid search for the optimum computationally infeasible. We instead adopt a

genetic algorithm to search for the optimal allocation. Since the use of genetic algorithms
is still quite rare in economics, in this section we briefly describe the algorithm.10

Genetic algorithms exploit the optimization principles found in nature: natural selection, gene-combin.tion, and mutation. Populations of candidate solutions are "bred" in
each generation using these principles, ideally yielding solutions increasingly better adapted

to the problem at hand. For our optimization problem, given a total number of monetary
unions, k, and a group of n countries, a candidate solution is an 1 x n vector, x, of alloca-

tions of the states across the k unions. An entry x(i) = j indicates that the ith state is a
member of the jth monetary union.
A population, P, consists of p candidate solutions. We begin in the first generation with

a purely randomly chosen population, P1 (that is, a p x n matrix of allocations, where
each state is assigned randomly to a union, j E {1, ...k}). For each candidate solution, we
calculate the fitness value, v(x), according to (10). The candidate solutions are then sorted

in descending order according to their respective fitness values, v(x), and their ranking
assigned to the 1 x p vector, r(x). The solution with the highest fitness value for generation

1, j, together with its fitness value, = max{v(x)}, and the average fitness value for the
'°The classic reference is Holland (1975). Koza (1993) provides a recent programming oriented treatment.
11

generation, l3 = avg{v(x)}, are stored.
The next step is to derive the successor generation of solutions. First, natural selection

is applied to select the members of the current generation surviving to the next generation.

Natural selection is based on a survival function 1(r) determining the probability that
solution x, with ranking, r, is chosen. f(r) is decreasing in r so that the successor generation

is less likely to be composed of low ranking solutions of the current generation. Solutions

chosen to survive are not eliminated from the original pooi, thus the best solutions of
generation i are likely to be represented several times in the successor generation. To
ensure continuity, the best solution from the current generation is always included at least
once in the successor generation.

The new population of solutions, F1' = {x'} is again sorted in descending order, r'
before allowing a fraction of these solutions to "mate" with their adjacent solutions. Mating
entails exchanging part of the solution vector. Specifically, after a random switching point,

1 <1 < n has been chosen, the 1 + 1

n, elements of solution of solutions s and s + 1 are

swapped, generl.ting a new population of solutions, P1" = {x"}. Finally, in order to emulate
natural mutations, a few (randomly chosen) elements of x" are replaced by random integers,

z E {1, ..k), yielding the starting population for the next generation P2.
The entire process is now repeated. At each generation, the algorithm yields an optimal

solution, 1,12,I3

i. together with an associated fitness value, t51,i)2,i3

& .While

the quality of the best solution improves rapidly before stabilizing, there is no easy way to
gauge whether a local or a global optimum has been found. Indeed, research in evolutionary biology suggest a fairly common occurrence of prolonged periods of apparent stability
suddenly interrupted by burst of rapid improvements, reflecting a gradual quality improve-

ment in the pool of solution finally reaching a critical level enabling further "evolutionary

spurts".
We used a number of tools to maximize the likelihood of finding a global optima. First,

within the solution process itself, the combination of a constant fitness value of the best
solution and an average fitness of the solution pooi, 5, fluctuating within very narrow band
over a prolonged sequence of generations provides evidence in favor of convergence and was

used as a termination criterion. Second, to control explicitly for the possibility of a local
optimum, the rate at which cells are randomly mutated is positively related to the stability
of the average fitness value, thereby injecting additional variability into the solution pool in
12

times of apparent or real stability. Finally, the algorithm has been tested on optimization
problems which are sufficiently small that an explicit grid search can be used. In each case,

the algorithm found the correct solution very rapidly, and the convergence criteria were
sufficient to distinguish between local and global optima.

4 Empirical Results
The methods described above were used to calculate the optimal currency unions for six
different geographic/economic regions: (1) the states of the USA, (2) 20 West European
countries, (3) the Group of Seven major industrial nations, (4) the members of the CFA,

(5) the successor states of the former Rouble zone and (6) 120 countries of the world at
large. These regions cover most, though by no means all, of acial or proposed monetary
unions, fixed exchange rate regimes, or common currency areas.

4.1 States of the USA
We begin with the 50 states of the USA, using the annual constant dollar data on Gross

State Product (GSP) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Since the United

States are already a single currency area, the data on GSP are the "within" monetary
union levels of output, (. Equation (8) can be inverted (assuming each of the fifty states
belongs to a single currency union) to calculate the GSP which would have prevailed had
these states not shared a common currency.
Table 2 reports the loss from forgone macroeconomic stabilization, expressed as a per-

centage of US GDP, against the number of independent currencies. With fifty separate
currencies this cost is, by definition, equal to zero. Adopting a single currency, in contrast,
costs the US states some 2.6 percent of GSP each year. These costs fall quite rapidly as the
number of currencies increases: with five currencies the cost is approximately 1.5 percent of

GSP, with ten currencies it is 1.2 percent, and it is less than 1 percent of GSP when there
are fifteen currencies, or more. Table 3 reports the optimal state groups for various values

of k, the total number of monetary unions. As an example, the optimal groups for three
contiguous and non-contiguous monetary unions are illustrated in figures la and lb. The
results are strikingly reminiscent of Mundell's concept of a western and an eastern dollar,
with a California dollar rounding out the picture.

Turning to the non-contiguous case, the loss minimizing solution is seen to entail very

different sized currency areas. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, North Dakota, Utah
and Washington form one currency area. Texas has its own currency. All of the remaining

states share the third currency. The optimal decomposition reflects two factors: the size
of the candidate members, and their covariance structure. It is thus tempting to conclude
that the behavior of the Texan economy — and to a lesser degree, that of California — is
qualitatively different from the other US states, requiring a separate Texan dollar for any
number of currencies greater than three. Yet, as table 3 reveals, as the number of currencies
is increased parametrically, the optimal grouping does not simply involve "breaking-up" the

larger currency areas into smaller components, but rather the combination of member of
different currency unions into new groups: with twenty currency areas, for instance, Texas

is paired with Hawaii, Missouri, Utah, and Wyoming. This result is well-known in the
theory of clubs: when the number of clubs is increased, the new groups often consist of
members from different existing clubs.1'

Next, we consider the effects of restricting monetary unions to be geographically con-

tiguous, in the sense defined above. When there is either a sinle currency area, or fifty
currency areas, the optimal contiguous and non-contiguous monetary unions obviously coincide. More generally, requiring contiguous unions restricts the allocation of states across

unions and lowers the attainable level of welfare. Table 2 compares the losses for various

numbers of m'cetary unions.

Twelve non-C ontiguous US Monetary Unions

Is

The maximum difference between contiguous and non-contiguous monetary unions is

in the order of 80% of the non-contiguous loss (that is, a loss of 0.84% of GSP instead of
0.46% of GSP). As a specific case, the three panels of figure 2 illustrate the optimal grouping

of states into 12 areas, contrasting the contiguous and the non-contiguous optimum with
the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. A comparison reveals significant differences. Restricting

districts to be contiguous, California rather than Texas becomes a lone rider, most other
groupings are distinctly different from the current Federal Reserve System. Yet -among the
subset of contiguous allocations- the Federal Reserve System is quite satisfactory: changing

to the optimal allocation only yields a welfare gain of 0.04, from 1.76 to 1.72 percent of
GDP. Major welfare benefits are however to be had if reserve zones were not restricted to

be contiguous: moving from the best 12 member contiguous to the best 12 member noncontiguous allocation reduces the cost by more than a third, 1.72 down to 1.00 percent of
GDP.

4.2 The European Countries
Perhaps the most exciting developments in monetary integration during recent years have

been in Western Europe where the members of the European Union have been striving
towards rigidly fixed exchange rates and, ultimately, a single currency — motivating a
substantial literatur on the merits of Europe as an optimal currency area.12

As an increase in the current union membership is likely, we consider the costs of
adopting a single currency for the existing European Union mrbers (Belgium, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and
the UK) as well as for a group of 20 European countries (the EU12 plus Austria, Cyprus,

Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey). The annual constant price
GDP data fom the period 1960-1988 are taken from the Summers-Heston data set. Figures
3 and 4 plot the stabilization costs of a single currency for all 20 European countries and

the twelve existing EU members. In each case, the cost is about 2.5% of GDP (it is
slightly higher for the 20 countries), roughly similar to the finding for the 50 US States.
In terms of foregone stabilization policy benefits, therefore, the European Union is no a

Three non-Contiguous European Monetary Unions

worse candidate for a monetary union than are the US states. (Of course, the transactions
benefits may be lower in Europe, and the scope for other forms of stabilization —through

fiscal transfers, for instance — may be more limited). Notably, the current EU members
do not appear to be better candidates for a single currency than an expanded union would
be.

Bringing the stabilization cost below 1% of GDP requires 6 currencies for the 20 Eu-

ropean countries. Bringing the stabilization cost below 0.5% of GDP — the European
Commission's £stimate of the transactions costs savings from adopting a single currency
— would require 9 separate currencies for the enlarged EU, and at least 6 currencies for

the existing European Union. At least according to these estimates, therefore, monetary
integration for the European Union would not be worthwhile.
Table 5 report the optimal groupings of the EU12 and EU2O countries for various num-

bers of independent currencies. In light of the emphasis on extending the "Deutschemark

zone" implicit in the European Monetary System to form the basis of the single currency,

the results are remarkable. As long as there are two or more currencies, Germany never
forms a currency union with any other European country. While pegging to the DM may
certainly bring benefits in the form of anti-inflationary credibility, it is not optimal from the

perspective of stabilizing output against macroeconomic shocks. The other major outlier
— perhaps less surprisingly — is the United Kingdom, which does not form a currency

union with other countries as long as there are three or more currencies for the EU. The
table also shows the optimal country groupings when monetary unions must be adjacent.

Once again, these are quite different from the unconstrained optimal allocation, and the
welfare loss is correspondingly higher. As an illustration, figure 5 display the optimal non-

contiguous unions for the case of three monies. Germany and the United Kingdom remain

independent, while the remaining countries form a monetary union, not unlike (if in an
extreme sense) the core periphery model advocated by proponents of two stage EMU.

4.3 The Group of Seven Major Industrialized Countries
The volatility of nominal exchange rates since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement has engendered a number of proposals for greater exchange rate fixity, at leastamong
the major industrialized countries. These proposals have generally foundered on the poten-

tial loss of sovereignty and monetary independence that a system of fixed exchange rates —
let alone a single currency — would entail. As a first step towards evaluating the idea of a

return to fixed exchange rates it is useful to calculate the costs from foregone stabilization

policy, as well as the optimal partners in a more modest scheme in which there would be,
say, three currencies, shared by the seven major industrialized countries (Canada, France,

Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

Cost (% GDP)
Single member currency unions listed below "—.-".

Performing the calculations, yields a 2.6% of G7 GDP cost of adopting a single currency

(Figure 6). With three currencies, however, this falls to 0.75% of G7 GDP. Again, as afrac-

tion of GDP, these are not very different from the results on the US states or the European

countries, above. The optimal currency areas, given in table 6, are largely intuitive. If the

G-7 share six currencies then the United States and Canada form an optimal bloc and the

others maintain separate currencies. With five currency areas, Canada, France and Italy,
form a second optimum currency area; with four currencies, Germanyjoins this continental

European bloc; followed by the United Kingdom when there are three crrrencies. If there

are only two currency areas, the US joins the European bloc,d while Japan continues to
maintain a separate currency.

4.4 The CFA
One of the most successful currency unions, at least in terms of longevity, is the CFA
zone of African countries.13 While the monetary union has survived the revaluation of

the external peg, the French Franc, the CFA Franc zone is generally not viewed as an
optimal currency area, reflecting the degree to which the non-diversified economies rely
on different primary product exports and hence their susceptibility to asymmetric shocks
[Bhatia (1985), Boughton (1991), Devarajan and Rodrick (1991)].

This is borne out in figure 6, which shows the cost of adopting common currencies,

always been linked by a llxed parity.

again calculated based on data from the Summers and Heston data.set. The figure reveals
that the loss in terms of foregone macroeconomic stabilization are significantly higher than
the corresponding costs for the US, the European countries, or even the G-7. Maintaining a
single currency costs some 11 percent of GDP, while two currencies costs almost 8 percent

of GDP. To bring the stabilization costs below 1 percent of GDP would require eleven
separate currencies for the twelve countries. The optimal country groupings, reported in
table 9, show that Cote d'Ivoire — which never shares its currency when there are two or
more currency areas — is the main outlier from the other members of the CFA zone. As
Boughton (1991, 1993) notes, the case for maintaining the CFA franc zone thus cannot rest

on the standard criteria of an OCA, but must rather be based on the crenibility, inflation
and competitiveness advantages obtained through the peg of the entire zone to the French
Franc.

4.5 Succesor States of the Former Soviet Union
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, a fifteen member monetary union came into
existence at the end of 1991. The extreme degree of specialization, coupled with continued

reliance on primary products, led most observers to reject the former Soviet Union as an
optimum currency area. 14 While a continuation of the ruble zone was widely advocated
— and indeed forme the declared policy objective of the Bretton Woods institutions until

the failure of the Tashkent Conference - the support was not based on classical OCA
grounds, but on the short- to medium term desirability of sustaining the established ruble
zone as a transitional system in favor of a fragmented system with multiple, internationally
unrecognized, and hyperinfiating currencies likely to further exacerbate the impending trade
collapse [Gros et cii. (1992), Gros (1993), IMF (1994), Wolf (1992)].

Beggar thy neighbor strategies by republican central banks able to extend credits to
local enterprises, an increasing unwillingness of Russia to accept the implied net resource

transfer, and the political benefits of introducing new national monies, however, doomed
efforts to prop up the ruble zone. Following the exit of the Baltic states, Russia's decision

to establish limits on interstate credit began the process of the ruble zone fragmentation,
with all republics now having introduced versions of separate national currencies [Hanson
141nded g,vn the high intrn&1 speci.ti&ton, it i. h.rd to orgoo th.t Ro.i by itgelf co,titote on optrnorn norrny

20

(1993)].
Data on republican output is scarce, covers only seven years and is — due to the cx post
reconstruction by the World Bank based on raw data collected by the planning organizations

— subject to significant "confidence intervals". Even these data were only available for

twelve successor republics. A further important qualification of the data concerns their
time consistency: the historical correlation of output mo'ements reflects decisions made

under a system of central planning, one might suspect that the correlation matrix will
change to some degree as the countries adopt more market orientated economic systems.
The results reported in table 8 must thus be viewed as only indicative.

Not surprisingly, the ruble zone fragments into groups centered around the two largest

republics, Ukraine and Russia. Allowing for more unions, it is Ukraine rather than Russia
breaking away for a separate currency. Turning to the recent re-integration efforts, the table

provides no support for the notion that Russia and Belarus constitute an optimal union.
Indeed, to the extent that the historical data can be taken seriously, the cost of maintaining

a common currency is some 4.5 percent of GD?. Figure 8, plotting the loss against the
number of unions, reveals no support for a either a continuation of the ruble zone or for the

sometimes proposed system of currency boards [Hanke, Jonung and Schuler (1993)] with
non-adjustable pegs, creating a de facto currency area vis a vis outside currencies.

4.6 The World Economy
Finally, we turn to the world at large. As Cooper (1984) notes , while the adoption of
a single global currency is unrealistic even in the medium term, it may provide a vision
guiding interim steps in improving international monetary arrangements. Moreover, it is
of some interest to examine whether the gradually emerging currency blocs — centered on
the dollar, the Deutschemark/ECU, and the Yen — can lay a claim to OCA status or are
predominantly the result of historical or political ccEsideratioi.
Table 8 reports the results for the non-adjacent world, again based on the Summers and

Heston data set. When there are three currencies (figure 8), the United States, Japan, and
Germany do indeed have separate currencies, however, the allocation does not correspond

to the fashioi. ahle three block hypothesis. The dollar "bloc" consists only of the United
States. The second i;lock, while including Japan and much of Asia, also comprises Canada,

Brazil and most of western Europe and thus cannot be labelled a Yen block. The third
group combines central and northern Europe with most of Africa and south west Asia,
again a far cry from a true DM block.

5 Conclusions
Most instances of countries sharing their currencies have arisen from a combination of
historical accidents and political forces. Yet as recent events in the monetary integration
of Western Europe have so dramatically shown, political will may be insufficient to sustain

integration efforts when the costs of foregone stabilization policy are too large. Indeed,
our results suggest that, had the states of the US not adopted a single currency before the
widespread use of stabilizing macroeconomic policy, the costs of forming a monetary union

may have proved prohibitive.

Three World non-Contiguous Monetary Unions

But the choice between the two extremes of a single currency or an independent currency for each country is a false one. Rather, regions which are considering the adoption of

a common currency should first try to identify optimal members of smaller unions, which
could later be linked if the correlation of shocks, or de facto factor mobility, become suffi-

ciently high. rn this context, it is revealing that a "two-track" Europe would consist of all
the EU countries except Germany forming one union, and Germany maintaining its separate currency. If the case for monetary integration in Europe (or even the states of the US)
is less than compelling, it is even more difficult to make for either theCFA countries or the

states of the Former Soviet Union.
In concluding, we raise a number of issues not addressed in the paper. The first of these

is to emphasize the "essentially political determination of currency questions" [Goodhart

(1993:5)]. The rapid disintegration of the ruble zone, the stability of the US dollar zone
and the move towards EMU cannot be wholly understood without explicit consideration of

non-economic objectives. Our approach in contrast is strictly limited to determining the
optimal economic composition of monetary unions. 16 Secondly, we have not addressed
the issue of seignorage: joining a monetary union generally entails reduced inflation tax

revenues for the higher inflation members. In principle, the algorithm used above can be
straightforwardly modified to restrict optimal unions to member, with comparable reliance

on inflation tax. 1n general, however, one suspects that the decision for membership in

a monetary union is partly motivated by a desire to reduce inflation and hence entails
reduced reliance on seignorage. Third, we have not taken account of the transitional costs

of moving fron one monetary arrangement to another. To the degree that these costs
are substantial, as observers have argued to be the case for the dissolution of the former
Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia, they weaken the case for splitting up an existing
federal monetary union such as the United States or Canada.17 Fourthly, we have said little

about the credibility effects of joining monetary unions. If a central bank administering an
existing independent currency has a poor reputation for avoiding hyper- or high inflations,

the gains from enhanced credibility obtainable by joining a low inflation monetary union

may outweigh the costs of foregone stabilization. Our estimates in this case should be
'6Goodhart (1993) provides a fuller treatment of the political issues involved in monetary unification and
disintegration.

monetary sovereignty.
