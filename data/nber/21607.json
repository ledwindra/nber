    "abstract": "\n\nWe use administrative data and a randomization design to examine the long-term educational impacts of a large-scale vocational training program for disadvantaged youth in Colombia on trainees and their relatives. Up to eleven years after randomization, trainees were more likely to enroll in formal tertiary education, and their relatives more likely to complete secondary schooling. Various empirical tests suggest that, for females, vocational training helped relax credit constraints stemming from the direct costs of tertiary education. For males, the evidence suggests that additional tertiary education investments arise from the program improving field-specific knowledge and/or information about field-specific returns to tertiary education. Focusing only on labor-market outcomes and not accounting for these long-term tertiary education impacts on participants substantially understates the social desirability of the Colombian vocational training program. By contrast, including tertiary education impacts on participants increases the program\u2019s internal rate of return for women from 22.2% to 23.5% and for men from 10.2% to 20.5%.\n\n",

This paper uses confidential SISBEN Census data; SABER 11 administrative data on graduation test scores from the Colombian Institute for the Promotion of Higher Education (ICFES); data from the System for Prevention and Analysis of Dropouts in Higher Education Institutions (SPADIES); and social security administrative records from the Integral System of Social Protection Information (SISPRO). The SISBEN data can be obtained directly from the Colombian Department of National Planning. The SABER 11 test scores can be obtained from ICFES.
