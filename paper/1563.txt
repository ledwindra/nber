Inventories, Stock—Outs,
and Production Smoothing

ABSTRACT

If stock-outs are ignored and if demand shocks are additive, then
optimal behavior requires that the marginal cost of production (MC)
be equated with the expected marginal revenue of increasing expected
sales by one unit (EMR) . However, with more general demand shocks (and
still ignoring stock-outs), the excess of MC over EMP. has the same sign
as the covariance of the slope of the demand curve and the marginal
valuation of inventory. The equality of EMR and MC is also broken by
taking account of stock—outs, even if demand shocks are additive.
If there is a production lag, then taking account of stock-outs
implies that optimal behavior will be characterized by production smoothing
even if the cost of production is linear. Two alternative definitions of
production smoothing are presented and optimal behavior in the presence
of stock-outs displays each type of smoothing.

It is a well—known proposition that a firm. producing a storable good
under conditions of increasing marginal cost will tend to smooth the time profile of its production relative to the time profile of its sales. The incen-

tive to smooth production arises from the fact that the cost function is a
convex function of the level of production. For a given average level of production, average costs can be reduced by reducing the variation in production.
Of course, if the cost function is linear in the

level of production, then

this incentive to smooth production disappears.

However, we will demonstrate

in this paper that if the possibility of stock—outs

is explicitly incorporated

into the firm's dynamic optimization problem (i.e, if we impose a non—
negativity constraint on inventories), and if there is a lag in

production.

then optimal behavior can be characterized by production smoothing even if the
cost function is linear.

Recently Blinder (1982) has shown that optimal behavior requires that the

firm set its price and its level of production so as to equate the marginal
cost of production (Mc) with the expected marginal revenue (EMR) from increas-

ing (expected) sales by one unit. Blinder's derivation of this result depends
crucially on two assumptions of his model: (1) there are no stock—outs, i.e.,

if demand exceeds available inventory, the firm is allowed to sell short output and to cover the sale in a future period; and (2) demand shocks are additive.

Maintaining assumption (1) but relaxing the assumption of additive

demand shocks, we show that this equality of MC and EMR does not hold in general.

Indeed we demonstrate that the excess of MC over EMR has the same sign

as the covariance of the marginal valuation of next

period's inventory and the

1. Recently, Schutte (1983) has shown that there is a negative level of
inventory in the stationary solution to Blinder's model. Schutte goes on
to argue that accounting for stock—outs introduces substantial
complications which are not readily handled in Blinder's model.

slope of the demand curve. For additive demand shocks, this

zero and MC =

covariance is

as in Blinder. We also show that if assumption (1) is

relaxed but assumption (2) is maintained, we once again find that

MC is not

equal to EMR.

We present a simple stochastic model of the production and pricing
behavior of a firm in Section I. This model explicitly incorporates stock

outs, but we show in Section l.A how this model can be used to analyze
behavior if the firm is allowed to sell short its output, as in Blinder
(1982). We then derive an expression for the excess of MC over EMR. In Section II we return to the model with stock—outs and show that even with addi
tive demand shocks, MC > EMR.

In Sections III and IV we assume that the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and we examine two alternative definitions of production smoothing.

In

Section III we show that if beginning—of—period inventory is increased by one
unit, the firm reduces its level of production by less than one unit.

This is

our first definition of production smoothing. In Section IV we present a
second definition of production smoothing: the variance of sales is greater
than the variance of production. We then show that if behavior is characterized by the first definition of production smoothing, then it is also characterized by the second definition. The concluding remarks in Section V include
a brief discussion of the pitfalls of trying to infer the stock—out history of
a firm from observations on the stock—out experience of an individual customer
of that firm.

I. The Model

Consider a firm which produces a storable good.2 Let

denote the physi-

cal stock of the good held in the firm's inventory at the beginning of period
t. The demand for the firm's product,

is a stochastic function of the

price, Pt,

where

h(p,

)

is an i.i.d. random variable with continuous

(1)
density function f(et).

We assume that h_ < 0 and that h > 0.
P.—
8

At

the beginning of period t, before observing the realization of the

random variable

8t the firm must decide how much output,

to

produce. This

output, which costs c(y), takes one period to produce and hence is not avail-

able for sale until period t +

1.

We suppose that c'(y) ) 0 and c''(y) ..

0.

The assumption that production does not take place instantaneously is impor—

taut for the results concerning

production smoothing in the presence of a

linear cost function, and the implications of relaxing this assumption will be

discussed in section III.A. The result that, in general, marginal cost is not
equal to expected marginal revenue continues to hold whether or not there is a
production lag.

(See footnote 7 for further details.)

In addition to setting

y the firm also sets the price Pt before observ-

ing the realization of c. After the firm chooses values for
realization of

a perishable good. In his model, "there are no intertemporal dynamic
links in inventory planning by the firm." However, in this paper we
analyze inventories of a storable good so that the firm faces an
intertemporal optimization problem.

high demand shocks so that demand does not exceed available inventory at
the market price.

4. Since we have assumed that e is i.i.d., we are ignoring the fact that
customers who are rationed in one period may have a higher demand in the
following period. We might expect such an effect for a durable good. On
the other hand, customers who are rationed might choose to take their
business elsewhere next period. In this paper, we simply ignore these two
opposing effects.

reducing the price this year. Note that a reduction in the current price will

However, the optimality conditions in (10) and (11) continue to hold without

More precisely, the value function

introduction of holding costs, but relations involving the value function in

(10) and (ii) continue to hold as written. Henceforth, we will ignore
any
holding costs.

Before analyzing further the first—order conditions in (10) and (11), we
digress to a discussion of the case in which stock—outs can be ignored.

I. A. Short Sales .g.Bg Backloas

In many inventory models, stock—outs are not explicitly modeled.

Rather

it is assumed (implicitly) that if demand exceeds available inventory, the
firm

in

effect sells short and covers the sale in a future period. (See, for

example, Blinder (1982)). Thus sales revenue is simply equal to price multiplied by demand. Formally, the first—order conditions derived above can be

applied to this situation simply by setting

If we allow short sales (by ignoring the non—negativity constraint on

inventories), then we must introduce some feature into the model which
prevents inventories from being run down to minus infinity. 1pically,
one introduces a convex cost of being away from some "target" level of
inventories, as in Blinder (1982) or in Feldstejn and Anerbach (1976).
Letting g(x) be a strictly convex cost of being away from some (implicitly
defined) target level of inventories, the Bellman equation is
V(x) =
max(n(p,y,x) + E[V(x+y—h(p,c))) where

We will consider two special cases of demand analyzed by Zabel (1972)

additive demand shocks, and (2) multiplicative

can be written as h*(p) + e.

in

h(p,e)

In this case h(p,e) is independent of e, and

the covariance in (15) is zero. Thus, if demand shocks are additive and if we
ignore stock—outs, we obtain c'(y) = EMR as in Blinder (1982).

Now suppose that demand shocks are multiplicative so that h(p,e) can be

written as h(p,e) =

Note that the inventory carried into next period,

x+y—h(p,c) is a decreasing function of c. Therefore, provided that V( )

is

concave,6 V'(x+y—h(p,c)) is an increasing function of a. Hence, the covari—
ance in (15) is negative and we obtain c'(y) < E}U.

More generally, we find that if

< 0 for all a, then c'(y) < EMR; if

> 0 for all a, then c'(y) > EMR. If the demand shock is additive, we
obtain the simple result that EMR =

We have shown in section I that if short sales are allowed, the

not hold if we take account of stock—outs (i.e., do not implicitly allow short
sales).

Comparing (16) and (17), we see that the marginal cost, c'(y), is equated with

the discounted unconditional expected marginal valuation of next period's
inventory however, expected marginal revenue,

EMit,

is equated with the

discounted conditional expected marginal valuation of next period's inventory,

where we condition on not stocking—out this period.

The reason for this

difference is that an increase in production will increase next period's
inventory regardless of whether or not there is stockout this period.

How

ever, reducing the current price to increase current expected sales by one
unit will increase current sales and reduce next period's

inventory only if

there is no stock—out this period. Thus, we equate EMit with the conditional
expected marginal valuation of next period's inventory.

(since y < x+y—h(p,e) if a C w) so that marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. The intuition for this result is that there are two ways to increase the
expected value of next period's inventory by one unit: (1) increase production

by one unit, or (2) raise price by —H'.

Increasing production by a unit

raises current costs by c'(y) and increases next period's inventory for all
realizations of the demand shock. Raising the price by —fl1 imposes a current

cost of EJ and raises next period's inventory only if the demand shock is
small enough not to cause a stock—out.

However, these are precisely the

situations in which the extra unit of inventory has the least value. Therefore, the marginal benefit of increasing production by one unit exceeds the

marginal benefit of raising price by —R. Therefore, equating marginal bene-

fits and marginal costs of each action requires that c'(y) be greater than
EMR.7

for sale until period t+1. Alternatively, if we assume that production in

Production Smoothina with Perfectly Inelastic Demand

In this section we present the first of two alternative definitions of
production smoothing and show that if the demand curve is perfectly inelastic,

then optimal behavior is characterized by production smoothing.

Our first

definition of production smoothing is that the optimal production rule as a
function of initial inventory is such that —1 <

< 0. That is, an increase

in initial inventory leads to a reduction in production. However, this
decrease in production is smaller than the increase in initial inventory.

We assume that the demand curve is perfectly inelastic, h

0, and that

the price of the good. p. is constant over time. The firm's only decision

variable is the level of production. and the optimal level of production
satisfies the first—order condition (10). Totally differentiating (10) with
respect to x and y we obtain

We have used the fact that the value function is strictly concave, i.e.,

if 0< a <land if A# 1B then
y(1A + (1—a)z!) > aV(xA) + (l_a)V(XB)

(22)

To show that (22) holds, consider a firm with inventory 1A + (1_a)1B and sup-

pose that it operates two stores, A and B. Store A has an initial inventory

If, in each periods the firm ships ay to

store A and (l—a)y to store B and if it directs a fraction a of its customers
to store A and fraction 1—a to store B, then the present value of net revenues

from the two stores is greater than or equal to aV(xA) + (1_a)V(xB), with
strict inequality if c'' > 0. To establish the strict inequality in (22) in

the case in which c''

0, we note that if one store (say A) stocks out and

the other store (B) does not stock out, the firm can

increase the present

value of its cash flow by transferring a unit of inventory from store B and
selling it at store A. Thus, the value function is strictly concave.
This production smoothing result can be easily understood with the aid of

Figure I. The upper panel of Figure I displays next period's inventory 't+l

inventory and the value of current production.

For example, if the current

inventory is x and the optimal value of current production is y, then the

solid line shows next period's inventory as a function of c. The bottom
panel in Figure I shows the marginal valuation of next period's inventory as a

function of e1. This relation is based on the fact that the marginal valuation of next period's inventory is a decreasing

function of next period's

inventory.

A'B'C'D' than along the solid line. However, if the cost function is linear,
optimality requires that the new level of production be such that the expected
marginal valuation of inventories remains unchanged (equal to the fixed value

of c'(y)) when x changes. Therefore, 4

For such a y**, the required equality of c'(y) and expected marginal

tion of next period's inventory will be satisfied. Therefore, we obtain production smoothing even though the cost function is linear.

of production smoothing in the presence of a linear cost function depends cru-

cially on a lag in production.

If production were instantaneous so that

< 0, then the variance of sales is greater than the variance of
pro-

duction.

It will be convenient to define

written as a function of

z x+y. Since production y can be

z, z can be expressed as a function of

9. In footnote 7, we derive the first—order conditions under the assumption
that production is instantaneous. With
a linear cost function, c'(y) is a
constant, say y, so that the first—order condition (F7.2) is
y

p(1—F(w*)] + E[V'(x+y—h(p,e))e<w*](*)

(F9.l)

Recalling that with instantaneous production, w
tu*(x+y,p), it is clear
that x and y enter (P9.1) only as a sum x+y. Thus the optimal value of
x+y is Constant.

Calculating the unconditional variance of each side of (24) yields

var(z) + var(y) —

2Cov(zt+i,yt+i)

var(z)

+ var(s) —

2Cov(z,s)

Rearranging (25) we obtain

var(s) =

var(y)

Recall that we have shown that

and t is low so that Cov(zay) < 0. Also, when

var(s) > var(y).10

Thus, we have shown that with a

production lag, the variance of sales

exceeds the variance of production even if the cost function c(y) is linear.

V. Couc1udjna Remarks

We have examined the production and

pricing behavior of an intertem—

porally optimizing firm. We demonstrated that marginal cost is equated with

(F10.d)

From (F1O.b)—(p1O.d), it follows that Cov(yz) < 0.
Now observe that Cov(s,z)
Cov(s,z) =

E[s(z—j)] so that

J{fh(PDC)(z(x)_i)fleda+Jx(z(x)_j)f(e)dg(x)dx

(F10.e)

Using the definition of B(p,x) in (6) as expected sales, equation (F10.e)
can be written as
Cov(s,z) =

JE(p,z)(z(x)—j)g(i)d1

(F10.f)

Observe that R(p,) is a constant and that

Therefore.

shocks are
expected marginal revenue if stock—outs are ignored and if demand
additive. If either of these conditions is not met, then marginal cost is not
equal to expected marginal revenue in general. We then showed that if demand
is perfectly inelastic and if there is a production lag, then optimal behavior

will be characterized by production smoothing even if the cost function

is

linear.

Casual empiricism or introspection may lead one to think that stock—outs

are rather uncommon. Rowever, we must be careful to distinguish between the
probability that an individual customer will be rationed and the probability

that the firm will stock out. As an extreme example, suppose that the firm
always carries an inventory of 999 and that each of the firm's 1000 customers

always demands one unit. In this case. the probability that any individual
customer will be rationed is only 0.1%. However, the firm will

stock—out in

every period. Thus, the fact that an individual is only rarely rationed provides no evidence that, from the firm's point of view, stock—outs are unusual.
