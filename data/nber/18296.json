    "abstract": "\n\nIn the American South, post-bellum economic stagnation has been partially attributed to white landowners' access to low-wage black labor; indeed, Southern economic convergence from 1940 to 1970 was associated with substantial black out-migration.  This paper examines the impact of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 on agricultural development.  Flooded counties experienced an immediate and persistent out-migration of black population.  Over time, landowners in flooded counties dramatically mechanized and modernized agricultural production relative to landowners in nearby similar non-flooded counties.  Landowners resisted black out-migration, however, benefiting from the status quo system of labor-intensive agricultural production.\n\n",
