ABSTRACT
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Graduate Education Initiative (GEI) provided over $80 million
to 51 treatment departments in the humanities and related social sciences during the 1990s to
improve their PhD programs. Using survey data collected from students who entered the treatment
and 50 control departments during a 15 year period that spanned the start of the GEI, we use factor
analysis to group multiple aspects of PhD programs into a smaller number of characteristics and then
estimate which aspects of PhD programs the GEI influenced and how these different aspects
influenced attrition and graduation probabilities. From these analyses, we identify the routes via
which the GEI influenced attrition and graduation rates and also indicate which aspects of PhD
programs departments should concentrate on if they want to improve their programs' performance.

Introduction
The length of time it takes students to earn a doctorate in the humanities is longer than in

any of the other of arts and science and engineering fields (Hoffer et al. 2004, table 15). By the
late 1980s, median registered time-to-degree, the number of years between entry to graduate
school and receipt of the PhD, in the humanities had risen to approximately 9 years and doctoral
programs in the humanities were also characterized by high attrition; even in some of the most
highly regarded humanities programs in the nation, it was common for more than half of the
students who started PhD programs to leave without earning a doctorate (Bowen and Rudenstine
1992).
To address these problems, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation launched a major new
program in 1991 called the Graduate Education Initiative (henceforth GEI). Its objective was “to
achieve systematic improvements in the structure and organization of PhD programs in the
humanities and the related social sciences that will in turn reduce unacceptably high rates of
student attrition and lower the number of years that the typical student spends working towards a
doctorate” (AWM Foundation 1991). The GEI was a unique intervention into graduate education
in that it focused on departments. Over a 10-year period (1991-2000), the Foundation provided a
total of over $80 million to 51 humanities and related social science departments at 10 major
universities. Each participating department committed to the goals of the program and developed
detailed strategies to achieve them.
Annual data were collected on all PhD students that entered these departments’ PhD
programs during the 10 years prior to the implementation of the program and during the program
period. In addition to collecting information on background characteristics (test scores, gender,
race/ethnicity, citizenship, prior masters degree) of the entrants, information was collected on the

1

type of financial support that the student received each year he or she was enrolled in the PhD
program and his or her status each year (left the program, continued in the program, graduated
from the program). Similar data were collected for all students that entered a set of 50 “control”
departments’ PhD programs; some of these departments were at the ten universities in which
other departments were part of the GEI and some of these departments were at three other major
research universities in which no department received any funding from the GEI. These control
departments were not randomly assigned but rather were chosen after the GEI began.
In previous research we have made use of the data reported by the departments to the
Mellon Foundation to estimate the impacts of the GEI on attrition rates, probabilities of
completion and times-to-degree using competing risk duration models and a difference-indifference approach (Groen, Condie, Jakubson, and Ehrenberg 2004).1 We concluded that the
GEI had a modest impact, reducing attrition rates and increasing completion probabilities at
treatment departments relative to control departments both by perhaps 2 to 4 percentage points,
and reducing mean time-to-degree by about .12 to .14 years. These analyses could not tell us,
however, whether these impacts were due to the financial support that the Mellon Foundation
provided to treatment departments or to changes that the departments made in their PhD
programs in response to the GEI.
In this paper, we go inside the “black box” of graduate education to investigate what
characteristics of graduate programs in the humanities and related social sciences actually
influence PhD students’ attrition and graduation probabilities. We make use of data from the
Graduate Education Survey; a retrospective survey of all graduate students who entered PhD

conducted by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. for the Mellon Foundation. After briefly
describing the survey in the next section, section III outlines our methodological approach.
Section IV presents our empirical findings and brief concluding remarks appear in section V.
While our focus is on evaluating the effects of the GEI, we believe the methodological approach
that we use can be profitably employed in a wide range of program evaluation studies.
II.

The Graduate Education Survey
The Graduate Education Survey (GES) was a retrospective survey conducted by

Mathematica Policy Research Inc. of all PhD students who had entered treatment and control
departments’ PhD programs during the 1982-1997 period.2 Between November 2002 and
October 2003, 18,671 individuals were surveyed and the GES achieved a rather remarkable
response rate of 74 percent, with 13,552 individuals responding. As might be expected, the
response rate was higher for individuals who completed their PhDs than individuals who did not
complete their PhDs and the response rates were lowest for the earliest entering cohorts of
students.
The GES was designed to obtain respondents’ views about the nature of their graduate
programs and graduate departments, their experiences while in graduate school and their post
degree (or post drop out) labor market experiences. The first section of the GES asked students
questions about their entry to their graduate programs (including type of financial aid offer), their
departments’ academic expectations and requirements and the means by which these were
conveyed to them. The second section asked questions about their interactions with their
dissertation advisors and their department, the overall learning environment in the department,

the time it took them to complete different phases of their programs and their publications, if
any, while in graduate school. The third section asked questions about their types of financial
support while in graduate school, and the relevance of this support to their doctoral study. The
fourth section solicited degree completion information and the following section solicited
demographic information, including marital status and the number of children in the
respondent’s family during his or her graduate study. A final section, whose data we will not use
in this paper, solicited information on their employment status at three points in time – six
months after degree completion or departure from their program, three years after that event, and
as of the survey date. A copy of the survey instrument and a detailed description of the
procedures followed during the survey are found in Kalb and Dwoyer (2004).
III.

Methodological Framework
Coupled with the data previously reported to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation by the

departments, the GES data provide an opportunity to analyze how the GEI impacted upon
characteristics of humanities and related social science doctoral program and how these
characteristics in turn influenced students’ probabilities of attrition from, and completion of, their
graduate programs. That is, it permits us to ascertain the routes via which the GEI influenced
PhD students’ attrition and completion probabilities.
While individuals were asked numerous questions in the GES about the characteristics of
their PhD programs, it is impossible for us to enter each characteristic as a separate explanatory
variable in an analysis of the students’ transition probabilities for two reasons. First, if we tried to
do this, we would quickly exhaust degrees of freedom and would be confronted with severe
collinearity problems. Second, even though the response rate to the GES was 74 percent,
response rates on individual questions were often much lower. Many survey respondents failed

4

to respond to a number of questions about the characteristics of their programs, at least in part
because some questions were not relevant for respondents who had dropped out of the programs
prior to the dissertation stage.
The strategy that we pursue to get around these problems in this paper is to compute the
average value of each program characteristic, for individuals who responded to that question, for
each entering cohort year/field/institution (for example students entering PhD study in English at
Cornell University in 1988) and to use these averages in factor analyses that combine all of these
characteristics into a smaller number of aggregated program characteristics.3 We then estimate
how the GEI influenced each of these aggregated characteristics and in turn how the
characteristics influenced students’ attrition and completion probabilities. From these two sets of
relationships, we can then estimate the routes via which the GEI influenced the PhD students’
attrition and completion probabilities.
IV.

Empirical Analyses
Table 1 reports the seven factors that we have chosen to summarize the characteristics of

humanities and associated social science doctoral programs: financial, seminar, exam
requirements, departmental culture, advising, clarity, and summer. Under each factor is the set of
specific variables that we use to construct the factor that are based on responses to questions
from the GES.
For example, the financial factor is based upon respondents’ answers to questions about
the number of years of support offered to students at their time of program entry, the type of
financial support that they had during their dissertation year, whether they had fears of losing
funding during the writing of their dissertation and whether their progress toward the PhD was
3

Appendix B provides an intuitive explanation of factor analysis and a discussion of the difference between it and
an alternative methodology, principle components analysis. Readers interested in more details can consult Lawley
and Maxwell (1971) or Joreskog and Sorbom (1979).

5

slowed by their being employed outside the department. The seminar factor is based upon
requirements students faced to attend courses or seminars during the academic year, which were
designed to move students more quickly through the program. The exam requirements factor was
based upon efforts to modify examinations to facilitate students’ transitions through the program.
The department culture factor was based on variables reflecting the interest faculty took
in students’ work, faculty involvement in the intellectual life of the department, and whether
there was a sense of competitiveness or cooperation in the department. The advising factor was
based upon variables that reflected more desirable and higher quality advising, while the clarity
factor was based upon variables that related to departmental clarity with respect to requirements
and efforts to monitor student performance. Finally, the summer factor was based on summer
expectations set by the department to facilitate student progress through the program. In each
case, individual questions from the GES have been recoded so that higher values of a variable
indicate larger values for the factor.
Table 2 presents our estimated factor equations for each factor. These were estimated
using the mean values of variables for each entering cohort year/field/institution for both
treatment and control departments. The factor loading coefficients can be thought of as the
regression coefficient that would emerge if we regressed the unknown factor on each of the
explanatory variables one at a time. So, for example, in the equation for the first factor, large
factor loadings are seen for the different numbers of years of financial support initially offered,
with less weight being placed on the remaining three variables. However, as the second column
indicates, many of these coefficients have large error variances (the uniqueness variable). The
factor scores found in the last column are the weights actually used to construct the factors; they
can be thought of as the regression coefficients that would emerge if we regress the unknown

6

factor on all of the variables (each in standard normal form) simultaneously. So, for example, the
most important variable in the financial factor proves to be whether the students were offered at
least two years of support when first admitted to the program, and the most important variable in
the exam factor is whether the exams students faced were tailored at least partially to their
individual research interests. Similarly, the most important variable in the seminar factor is
whether the students were required to attend a dissertation-writing seminar.
Table 3 presents our estimates of the impact of the GEI on each of the factors, as well as
on two other variables we constructed from the survey data that summarize students’ beliefs
about their departments’ expectations about dissertations. The first variable (Publish) denotes the
fraction of respondents in the entering cohort year/field/institution that said that the department
stressed the importance to them of polishing their dissertations prior to submission, even if this
delayed completion of their degree, or of publishing while in graduate school, even if this
delayed completion of their degree. The second variable (Quick) denotes the fraction of
respondents in the entering cohort year/field/institution that said that the department stressed to
them the importance of finishing dissertations as quickly as possible. These two variables do not
add up to one (indeed typically their sum is less than one half) because students were given the
option of responding that their department did not indicate its attitude towards finishing the
dissertation or that the attitudes of different members of the department were inconsistent on this
issue.
The underlying model used in the first panel of table 3 groups the data by entry cohort
year/field/institution and regresses each factor score on dichotomous variables for department
and institution, a dichotomous variable for whether the department is treatment or control
department, a dichotomous variable indicating whether the entering cohort is a pre-program

7

cohort or a cohort entering after the program was instituted, and the interaction of the latter two
variables. The coefficients of the last variable provide our estimates of the impact of the GEI on
each factor; essentially it is the difference-in-difference estimate. In order to measure longer-run
changes, students that began their PhD study between 1986 and 1990 are excluded from the
analysis, because while they entered graduate school before the GEI began in 1991, they were
eligible for financial support from the GEI starting in 1991.
The estimates presented in panel 1, in which each observation is given equal weight,
suggest that the GEI’s primary effect on doctoral programs in these fields was felt through the
seminar, summer and clarity factors and through increased encouragement to finish dissertations
as quickly as possible; these were the only four variables for which the estimated effects were
statistically significant. The second panel in the table provides similar estimates when cohort size
is added as an additional explanatory variable to the underlying models. The addition of cohort
size does not significantly change the results. Panel 3 presents the estimates of the cohort size
variable in these models – decreasing cohort size is associated with higher values for the
financial factor, lower values for the seminar factor, and higher values for the departmental
culture and advising factors. We know from our prior research that one of the actions that
departments took in response to the GEI was to reduce cohort size (Groen et al. 2004).
Entering cohort sizes, as well as the fraction of surveyed individuals that responded to the
GES, differed substantially across entering cohort years/fields/institutions in the sample. Hence
the numbers of individual observations from which the factor scores are calculated vary widely
across entering cohort years/fields/institutions and thus the variance of the factor scores varies
across observations. To control for this, we reestimated the regressions in table 3 (without the
cohort size variable included) weighting each observation by the average number of valid

8

responses to the survey that were used in the construction of the factor scores for each cohort
year/field/institution observation. These results are found in the fourth panel of table 3.
The weighted results differ somewhat from the unweighted results. In particular, while
the GEI continues to appear to have led to a statistically significant improvement in the seminars,
summer requirements and clarity factors, it no longer is seen to be associated with a statistically
significant improvement in the expectation that dissertations would be completed as quickly as
possible. This suggests that the improvements in the latter variable that was attributed to the GEI
in the unweighted analyses (panel 1 of the table) occurred primarily in the smaller programs that
took part in the GEI. On the flip side, the weighted results show a larger estimated impact of the
GEI on the financial factor, which suggests that these improvements occurred primarily in larger
programs.4
To estimate the impact of the different PhD program characteristics on attrition and
graduation probabilities, we use the individual level data collected by the treatment and control
departments and estimate multinomial logit models of the probability that an individual drops out

4

One extension that we conducted warrants brief discussion. The adjustment described above for differences in
cohort size and differences in response rates across cohort year/field/institution observations may be inadequate. To
see why, consider the following example: Suppose an entering cohort year/field/institution observation had 20
students, that 10 of these students received PhDs, 5 were still enrolled in their PhD program, and 5 had dropped out.
Suppose also that only 10 members of the group responded to the GES. It is reasonable to assume that responses to
the survey questions may differ between students in the three groups; for example, completers may rate the
characteristics of the department’s PhD program more positively than people who have dropped out. Hence our
estimated average values of the factor scores for this entering cohort year/field/institution might well be very
different if the 10 respondents to the GES from the group were all completers than if the 10 respondents were all still
enrolled in the program or had dropped out.
To take account of this possible problem, we recalculated the factor scores for each entering cohort
year/field/institution group in a different manner. Instead of taking the averages for all GES respondents in the
group, we computed the averages for each subgroup (completers, continuers, and those who dropped out) and then
computed the overall average for the group as a weighted average of the subgroup averages, where the weights were
the shares of the entering cohort year/field/institution group that the department-provided data indicated were in
each of the three categories of students. We then reestimated the factor equations and the effect of the GEI on the
factor scores using these adjusted data. However, when we did this, the results we obtained were very similar to
those that appear in the first panel of table 3.

of a PhD program or graduates by the end of each year of enrollment in the program.5 The
explanatory variables included in these models are an individual’s gender, race/ethnicity,
citizenship, dichotomous variables for the field in which the student was studying, and
dichotomous variables for the institution in which the student is studying. In addition, for each
individual observation, we add in the estimated values of the seven program characteristics
factors and two departmental dissertation expectation variables for the entering
cohort/field/institution.
The marginal effects for the program characteristics appear in table 4.6 We estimate
impacts on the cumulative probability of attrition for years 1 to 11 and on the cumulative
probability of graduation for years 4 to 11. The marginal effects reported in the table are
estimates of the impact of a one unit change in each variable on the probabilities of attrition or
graduation by each year.
Turning first to attrition, improvements in the financial factor reduce the cumulative
probability of attrition in almost all years. The effect on the cumulative probability is largest in
the first three years, which implies that the largest effect is on early attrition.7 Having a program
with better advising and having a program whose requirements are clearer also reduces attrition
probabilities in many years. Finally, departmental expectations about the dissertation influence
attrition rates.
Departments that emphasize the importance to students of polishing their dissertations
and/or getting things published while in graduate school (even if this delayed completion of the

5

Because of the small number of students that complete their programs in years 1 to 3, we only estimate binary logit
attrition equations for those years.

When we reestimated the models including cohort size as an additional explanatory variable, we obtained very
similar results.

The primary variable that was important in the financial factor was offering entering students at least two years of
support (see table 2).

degree) have higher cumulative attrition rates than departments that do not convey clear
expectations about the dissertation to students. In contrast, departments that stress to students the
importance of finishing dissertations quickly have lower cumulative attrition rates, starting in the
early years of the program, than do departments who do not convey clear expectations about the
dissertation to students. Both of these “dissertation advice” variables begin to influence attrition
probabilities by year 2, which suggests that students’ views of departmental expectations about
dissertations affect early attrition.8 The growing magnitude of the Publish variable’s effect in the
later years implies that this variable also influences attrition during the dissertation stage of
programs.
Turning next to graduation, improvement in the financial factor improves cumulative
graduation probabilities, starting in year 6. The advising factor is perhaps the most important
factor; when the advising factor improves, other factors held constant, the cumulative probability
of graduation increases in all years and the magnitude of this effect increases with time enrolled
in the program.
The nature of dissertation expectations also proves important in influencing early
completion. Relative to the omitted category (not providing clear signals about dissertation
expectations), departments whose expectations are that their students will polish their
dissertations and/or that their students will publish while in graduate school (even if this delays
completion of their degrees) have significantly lower cumulative probabilities of graduation in

8

We also estimated models in which the students’ dissertation advisors’ views about the nature of the dissertation
were included. When we did these, we found what appeared to be a perverse finding: students associated with
dissertation advisors who expected their students would polish their dissertations and/or publish while in graduate
school, even if these actions delayed completion of their degrees, had lower attrition rates during the early years of
their PhD programs. Upon reflection, we realized that this represented a problem of unobserved selection bias,
which can be explained best by reference to Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman. Heckman is known to
have extraordinarily high standards for his students’ dissertations and, for both supply and demand reasons, only the
very best students work with him. Hence the direction of causation most likely runs from top student to lower early
drop out rates; the advisor attitude variable is endogenous.

11

years 6 through 8, other variables held constant. Similarly, relative to the omitted category,
departments that stress to their students the importance of promptly finishing dissertations have
higher cumulative graduation probabilities starting in year 4, with the effect substantially higher
in years 6 through 10.
V.

Concluding Remarks
The results we presented in table 3 suggest that GEI program impacts were strongest on

the summer requirements, seminar and clarity of expectations factors, and also on the proportion
of individuals who said their department encouraged them to complete their dissertations as
quickly as possible. Taken together with the results presented in table 4, our findings suggest that
the GEI reduced attrition rates and improved graduation rates primarily through the routes of
improving clarity of expectations and encouraging students to finish their dissertations as quickly
as possible.9
Gauging the impact of each of these changes on cumulative graduation and attrition rates
is important. For example, the estimated impact (table 3) of the GEI on the clarity factor was
.322 and the estimated impact of the clarity factor on the probability of attrition by the end of
year 7 (table 4) was -.013. An estimated impact of the effect of the GEI on attrition by year 7
working through the increase in program clarity is the product of these two numbers, or -.004.
Similarly, the estimated impact of the GEI on stressing the importance to students of finishing
9

Treatment contamination is always a concern in analyses of program effects and the problem is potentially present
with the GEI also. There are three types of departments in our analyses: 1) departments that received funding from
the GEI, 2) departments that did not receive funding from the GEI but were located at universities in which some
other departments did receive GEI funding and 3) departments at universities in which no departments received
funding from the GEI. The behavior of departments in the second group may well have been influenced by what was
going on in departments in the first group and their universities may have provided them with additional resources to
compensate them for not receiving GEI resources. However, when we redid our analyses using only departments in
the third group as “control” departments our results were very similar to those reported in the text. Of course
changes that may have occurred at GEI departments to improve their graduate programs may have been known to
departments in the third group, which in turn may have caused them to make similar changes in their programs for
competitive reasons. Hence it is likely that our estimates are lower bound estimates of the effects of the GEI on
program characteristics.

12

their dissertations promptly was .073 (table 3) and the estimated impact of this variable on
graduating by year 8 was .084 (table 4). Thus the estimated impact of the GEI on the probability
of graduating by year 8 working through the increased encouragement to students to finish their
dissertations promptly is the product of these two numbers, or .006.
While each of these effects may seem quite small, their magnitudes should be interpreted
in terms of our earlier analyses of the overall impact of the GEI on attrition and completion
probabilities. There we found that that the GEI reduced attrition rates and increased completion
probabilities at treatment departments relative to control departments by about .02 to .04 (Groen
et al. 2004). Hence the impact of the GEI on these PhD program characteristics “explains” a
substantial share of the overall effect of the GEI.10
While the GEI appears to have had an impact on characteristics of graduate programs,
there remains substantial room for improvement. Table 5 ignores the distinction between
treatment and control departments and presents summary statistics for each of the factors and
dissertation advice variables for cohorts in our sample that entered after the start of the GEI
(1991-1996). The mean value of the clarity factor was .238 across entering cohorts/departments
during this period, the 25th percentile value was -.365 and the 75th percentile was .945. The
difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles is 1.310, which is more than four times our
estimated impact of the GEI on the clarity factor. So if one could improve the clarity factor for
departments down at the 25th percentile up the level of the clarity factor for departments at the
75th percentile, one could reduce attrition by year 7 in the former departments by about .02.
Similarly, the mean value of the Quick variable was .248 in this period, but the 25th to
75th percentile range in this variable was .083 to .357, a difference of .274. This is over three
10

Groen et al. (2004) also showed that the routes via which the GEI improved attrition and graduation probabilities
included reductions in entering cohort sizes and improvements in entering students’ GRE scores.

13

times the size of the estimated impact of the GEI on this variable. If one could move departments
down at the 25th percentile in terms of the Quick variable up to the 75th percentile, one could
increase the probability of students graduating by year 8 from the former departments also by
about .03.
So an important message of this analysis is that the value of the GEI is considerably
greater than the impacts on attrition and graduation probabilities that we believe it caused. The
knowledge it has provided the academic community on which factors are associated with
attrition and graduation probabilities in humanities and related social science graduate programs
should provide a map for departments and graduate deans on how to improve their programs in
the future.
Finally, we should again stress that our estimates of the effects of the GEI on the various factors,
and hence on attrition and graduation rates, may well be only lower bound estimates of the true
effects of the program. To the extent that the “control” departments in our sample were aware of
the changes that the “treatment” departments were making in their programs and emulated the
behavior of the latter, our methodology will understate the GEI’s actual effects.

Appendix B
A Reader’s Guide to Factor Analysis
The substantive problem we face in this paper is trying to determine the routes via which
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation’s Graduate Education Initiative had effects on the attrition
rates and graduation rates of PhD students in the humanities and associated social sciences. The
Foundation’s Graduate Education Survey provides us with information on a large number of
variables that relate to the nature of the students’ graduate programs, including ones related to
financial support, seminar requirements, exam requirements, departmental culture, departmental
advising, clarity of requirements and expectations and summer support (table 1).
These variables are, not surprisingly, both numerous and highly intercorrelated, so that
one cannot simply include 50 or so of them as explanatory variables in the outcome equations.
Therefore a method is needed to find lower dimensional combinations of the variables that
summarize the information they provide. The way we do this is described below.
For ease of explanation, assume that there is just one aspect of the program we which to
capture, for example, financial generosity. We have a number of measures of this which are
highly intercorrelated. Adding all of them to the outcome equation would result in a collinearity
problem, which in turn would lead to estimates that are both imprecise and unstable.
We could just choose a subset of the variables to include in the analysis. To do this would
discard all of the information in the unused variables and would lead to problems of omitted
variable bias. Moreover, it is not obvious how to choose the subset to keep. We instead use
information from all of the observed variables. Essentially, we find a (linear) combination of the
observed variables that represents our best estimate of the common component financial
generosity.
Let’s start with an explicit example. Suppose that there are four observed characteristics
that reflect this common component. Let yit be the measured variable for individual i and
variable t. The index i reflects the number of observations and goes from 1 to N, while the index
t reflects the variables and goes from 1 to 4 in this example. Let ci be the underlying common
“factor” which we’ll think of as financial generosity, and suppose that the data were generated by
the following model:
yi1 =
(A.1) yi2 =
yi3 =
yi4 =

β1ci + εi1
β2ci + εi2
β3ci + εi3
β4ci + εi4

We assume that the εit’s have mean zero and are uncorrelated with one another and with
ci, though they may have different variances. (Those orthogonality conditions essentially define,
in a statistical sense, what ci is.) If the common factor ci were observable this would simply be a
system of regression equations. Since it is not observable we want to find a (linear) combination
of the observed yit’s that best predicts ci. That is, we want

24

(A.2) E*(ci | yi) = γ’yi
where yi is the vector (yi1 , yi2 , ... yiT)’. One can show that the optimal set of weights is
(A.3)

γ = [V( y i )]−1 Cov( y i , c i )

Thus, γ is a function of the underlying parameters of the model. If we knew those then we
would know γ. Because we don’t know them, we must use estimates of the parameters to form an
estimate of γ. However, because ci is not observable we cannot estimate the system of regression
equations implied by (A.1). Instead, the information about the parameters comes from the
variance matrix of the observed variables. Let
Var(ci) = ϕ2
Var(εit) = σt2
Cov(εit , εis) = 0 for t ≠s

Because ci is not observed we need to set scale by normalizing one parameter. The
tradition in psychology is to normalize ϕ2 = 1. An equivalent, and easier to explain,
normalization is to set β1 =1 , that is, we measure the β’s for the other variables relative to that of
the first variable. Given the latter normalization, the variance matrix for the observed yi is

where we’ve just filled in the upper triangle of the matrix since it is symmetric. We can now
solve for the parameters as functions of the elements of the variance matrix:
β 2 = ω 23 / ω13
ϕ 2 = ω12 / β 2
β 3 = ω13 / ϕ 2

β 4 = ω14 / ϕ 2
25

σ12 = ω11 − ϕ 2
σ 22 = ω22 − β 22 ϕ 2
σ 32 = ω33 − β 32 ϕ 2
σ 24 = ω 44 − β 24 ϕ 2
and we’ve solved for all of the parameters. The linear combination of the data that we want (i.e.,
γ) is just
γ = [V( y i )]−1 Cov( y i , c i ) = ( ββ′ϕ 2 + Σ) −1 )(βϕ 2 )
Note that there are multiple estimates of some parameters. For example,
β 2 = ω 23 / ω13 = ω 24 / ω14
The statistical method provides for the optimal average of these multiple estimates in cases like
this.
We use the sample analogs of the quantities above to form the estimators. Using the
sample variance matrix

γˆ = ( βˆ βˆ ′ϕˆ 2 + Σˆ ) −1 )(βˆ ϕˆ 2 )
This is the factor score regression, that is, the linear combination that is the predicted
value of the underlying common factor c given the observed data y. Multiplying the data by
these weights gives us a value for financial generosity which we can use as an explanatory
variable in an outcomes analysis.
In our problem we have a number of different factors of interest (financial generosity,
summers, etc.). We create the factors in three steps:
Step 1: Identify those variables which we think reflect the same underlying factor. For example,
we take the set of variables which reflect financial aid, recode them so that a higher value means
more generous, and use them in the analysis.

26

Step 2: Compute the average value of each variable, for individuals who respond to the
underlying question, for each group defined by entering cohort year/field/institution.
Step 3: Do the factor analysis to find the factor score regression defined above.
We then repeat those steps for each of the factors.
It is important to realize the difference between our approach and an alternative approach
that would use principal components analysis. Principal components is a way to find linear
combinations of the data which “account for” the largest amount of the total variation, not the
common variation. The weights in the first principal component are the eigenvector
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of Ω. This will sometimes give similar answers to the
factor analysis, but other times can give very different answers.
Consider the following example:
Var(ci) = 1
yi1 = (1) ci + εi1
yi2 = (1) ci + εi2
yi3 = (2) ci + εi3
yi4 = (.1) ci + εi4

Var(εi1) = .05
Var(εi2) = 10.0
Var(εi3) = .05
Var(εi4) = 5.0

y1 is the base case. y2 has the same mean relationship but is extremely noisy. y3 has the same
disturbance variance as y1 but a stronger mean relationship, and y4 has a weaker mean
relationship than y1 and is noisier, though not as noisy as y2. For these values we have

so that the last column of the matrix contains the weights for the first principle component. Note
that the weight on y2 is very large, more than six times larger than the weight on y1.
In contrast, the pattern of weights from the factor analysis is very different. We have,
using the formula above
γ = (.1978, .0010, .3950, .0002)
and then normalizing them so that they have unit length, like the principal component, yields
weights of
γ* = (.4472 , .0022 , .8944 , .0004)’
We see that the factor analysis puts higher weight on variables with small error variances
and strong relationships to the common factor, that is, it “rewards” the variables that reflect the
common components of variation rather than idiosyncratic components.
