Congressional Influence as a Determinant of Subprime Lending
Stuart A. Gabriel, Matthew E. Kahn, and Ryan K. Vaughn
NBER Working Paper No. 18965
April 2013
JEL No. G21,R21
ABSTRACT
We apply unique loan level data from New Century Financial Corporation, a major subprime lender,
to assess whether attributes of Congressional Representatives were associated with access to and pricing
of subprime mortgage credit. Research findings indicate higher likelihoods of subprime loan origination
and lower mortgage pricing among borrowers represented by the Republican and Democratic leadership
of Congress. Black borrowers also benefitted from significantly larger loan amounts in those same
districts. Also, borrowers received mortgage interest rate discounts in districts where New Century
donated to the Congressional Representative. Findings provide new insights into the political geography
of the subprime crisis and suggest gains to trade between New Century Financial Corporation and
targeted Congressional Representatives in the extension, pricing and sizing of subprime mortgage
credit.

Introduction
Implosion in housing markets figured prominently in the 2007 meltdown in capital
markets and the downturn in the global economy.1 Neither analysts on Wall St. nor regulators in
Washington, D.C. anticipated the depth of the crisis, its geographic and asset class contagion, or
its adverse effects on household balance sheets. Emblematic to the crisis was the pervasive
failure of subprime mortgages. Those loans provided substantially eased credit qualification and
homeownership opportunity to low credit-quality borrowers. As shown in Demyanyk and Van
Hemert (2007), the quality of originated subprime mortgages began to deteriorate even prior to
the housing bust. By 2008, in the wake of downward spiral in house prices, a full 45 percent of
subprime borrowers were underwater. Two years later, a similar share of outstanding subprime
mortgages were in default.
Early on and prior to the deterioration in subprime loan performance, lenders appeared to
understand the controversial nature of their product and the related importance of Congressional
support. To that end, lenders may have sought to direct campaign contributions to elected
Representatives to generate support for subprime loan products and to assist in easing regulatory
oversight. As documented by Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi (forthcoming), lenders became politically
sophisticated in making campaign contributions to elected Representatives in the years leading
up to the 2000s crisis.
A second potentially complementary strategy for capturing political support was for
lenders to offer more credit and at better terms to borrowers in Districts represented by targeted
Congressional Representatives. As further suggested by Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi (forthcoming),

1

As reported in Shiller (http://www.econ.yale.edu/shiller/data.htm)), US national house prices recorded a decline of
31 percent over the 2006 - 2010 period, about on par with the peak-to-trough contraction during the Great
Depression.

such strategic interactions and related side-payments could be important in a world in which
explicit “quid pro quo” was not politically feasible. To the extent that interests aligned, both
direct campaign contributions as well as District-level direction and pricing of mortgage credit
could serve the political economic interests of both the lender and the elected official. Districtlevel expansion of mortgage and housing opportunity could be viewed as a political return to
Representatives in exchange for expanded subprime lending opportunities.
This study uses the universe of first-time homebuyer residential home loans issued by a
major subprime lender to study the role of Congressional political influence in the access to and
pricing of subprime mortgage credit.

It provides a political economy explanation for the

geography of subprime lending. By merging several data sets, we seek to implement the
following thought experiment. Consider two identical marginal borrowers called “A” and “B”
who live in the same local labor market at the same point in time. Assume that the two borrowers
live in comparable but different residential communities. If “A’s” Congressional Representative
is liberal, is a member of the Finance Committee, is a leader of the House of Representatives, or
if this Representative receives direct campaign contributions from the subprime lending
institution, do these Congressional attributes influence the probability that the institution makes a
loan to A versus B? Further, are these same attributes associated with higher or lower loan
amounts or loan pricing to A versus B?
The loan level data in our study come from the servicing database of the now defunct
New Century Financial Corporation (New Century) and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA). Like other studies, we control for the borrower, loan, or locational attributes that
influence the allocation and risk-based pricing of mortgage credit. Unlike other studies, those
controls are not the focus of this study. Instead, while controlling for a rich set of household

attributes, zip code attributes and including state/year/month fixed effects, our goal is to assess
how attributes of the local Congressional Representative influenced access to and pricing of
subprime mortgage credit. The “politics” hypothesis posits that these attributes mattered because
New Century had specific political goals in mind and used implicit subsidies to achieve those
objectives.
The eased qualification requirements associated with subprime lending also may have
been important to policymakers seeking to attain federally-mandated lending goals related to
minority homeownership. Indeed, as evidenced in numerous recent studies (see, for example,
Gabriel and Rosenthal (2005, 2011), racial minorities have been largely underrepresented in
homeownership attainment. During the years leading up to and including the boom, substantial
policy effort was directed at narrowing racial homeownership gaps.2 Prominent among those
efforts were ambitious quantitative goals for financial institution loan origination among
minority and other households as embodied in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).
Accordingly, below we test as well for whether minority borrowers received differential
treatment by New Century. In particular, we test whether minority borrowers had a greater
probability of receiving subprime loans as a function of their Congressional Representative’s
attributes. Also, conditional on receipt of a subprime loan, we test whether minority borrowers
received more favorable loan terms (as evidenced in loan size or loan pricing) as a function of
their Representative’s attributes.

Both Presidents Clinton and G. W. Bush sought to address racial and ethnic gaps in homeownership. In a
statement dated June 18, 2002, President Bush noted that “The goal is that everyone who wants to own a home has a
shot at doing so. The problem is we have what we call a homeownership gap in America. Three-quarters of Anglos
own their home, and yet less than 50 percent of blacks and Hispanics own homes. That problem signals that
something may be wrong in the land of plenty. And we need to do something about it.” See White House News
Release from that date.

Assessment of New Century Financial Corporation loan level data from 2003 – 2006
reveals a new political geography of subprime lending.

Our findings highlight that New

Century was especially active in offering differential treatment to borrowers represented by the
Democratic and Republican leadership of Congress. In the case of borrowers residing in the
districts of the Speaker of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders and whips, subprime
lenders were less likely to reject loans; further, New Century offered lower mortgage interest
rates and large loan amounts, all things equal, to residents of those areas. This fact is especially
true for African American borrowers in these districts. Also, borrowers received rate discounts in
districts where New Century donated to the local Congressional Representative’s election
campaign.
This paper contributes to the literature investigating the causes and consequences of
private industry’s political contributions to the Congress. Ansolabehere, De Figueiredo, and
Snyder (2003) argue that political contributions appear to yield a very high return and this raises
the question of why industry does not increase its contributions to the Congress. Bombardini and
Trebbi (2011) document the role of the electoral strength of an interest group that could support a
representative’s re-election campaign. Krozner and Stratmann (2005) study repeat contributions
of PACs to representatives and document strategic interactions whereby representatives build a
reputation for taking certain positions that help industry and are rewarded by special interests.
Bronars and Lott (1997) and Stratmann (2002) both report evidence that changes in campaign
contributions are correlated with changes in roll call voting by members of Congress. In earlier
work, Stratmann (1992) presents evidence documenting how farming PAC contributions are
targeted to specific representatives depending on who their constituents’ attributes. Mian, Sufi
and Trebbi (2010) document the voting patterns by representatives on key pieces of banking

legislation after the crisis of 2008 began. They document that representatives from areas where
there were more subprime lending activity were more likely to vote for bailouts.
Unlike these earlier studies, using our detailed loan data we are able to investigate how a
major firm directed its campaign contributions to specific Representatives as well as directed its
loans to constituents of those same Representatives. Such representatives likely recognized that
New Century was pleasing their constituents by allowing them increased access to capital at
lower interest rates (see Mian and Sufi 2009). We document the geographic clusters of lending
and pricing activity across congressional districts while relying on micro data that allows us to
control for a rich set of borrower attributes. By enhancing credit access to underserved
borrowers, the lending patterns we document were likely to have increased constituent support
and helped to keep the incumbent in power.
The plan of the paper is as follows. The following section describes the data and sample.
Section 3 discusses econometric strategy and results of analysis of HMDA and New Century
microloan files, including assessment of mortgage origination and pricing. Section 4 provides
concluding remarks.
II. Data and Sample
Loan level information was obtained from the servicing database of New Century
Financial Corporation. New Century was founded in 1995 as a REIT that originated mortgage
loans in the U.S. through its operating subsidiaries, New Century Mortgage Corporation and
Home 123 Corporation. As of January 1, 2007, New Century was the second largest subprime
mortgage lender in the U.S., with 7,200 full-time employees and a market capitalization of $1.75
billion. On April 2, 2007 and in the wake of substantial deterioration in the performance of
subprime mortgages, New Century sought Chapter 11 relief. Also that month, New Century

filed an 8-K indicating that it had previously over-stated earnings. On March 26, 2008, the
bankruptcy court examiner outlined a number of "significant improper and imprudent practices
related to its loan originations, operations, accounting and financial reporting processes. The
complete set of New Century loan records became available for academic and research use as a
result of the bankruptcy settlement. While we acknowledge that most of this paper’s evidence is
based on one bank’s actions, these represent the best available micro data for investigating our
key research questions related to the pricing of mortgages.
We analyze a subsample of loans from the two operating subsidiaries, including New
Century Mortgage Corporation and HOME 123 Corporation. The dataset is comprised of a
panel of individual loan records and includes an unusually rich set of borrower, loan, and
locational controls. Further, the data provides a rare opportunity to evaluate loan origination and
pricing for one of the largest of the nation’s subprime lenders. The Loan database was merged
with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data in each year to obtain the race and
gender of the borrower for sampled loans. Borrower controls include borrower age, race, gender,
monthly household income, FICO score, borrower combined LTV, zip code of residence, and
originated loan rate. We use loans for the years 2003 through the end of 2006. Congressional
redistricting took place in January 2003 and the bank shut down in February 2007. Our data
cover the 108th and half of the 109th Congress.
Using the MABLE/Geocorr2K Geographic Correspondence Engine, we merged borrower
zip code of residence to their Congressional District.3 If a zip code crossed a Congressional
District, we assigned the Congressional District that had a larger share of the zip code’s total

3

See http://mcdc2.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr2k.html.

population.4 We obtained data on race, tenure, and political ideology of the Congressional
Representative in each zip code from two sources.

Keith Poole’s voteview.com database

provides information on each Representative’s conservative ideology score (dwnominate’s 1st
factor) and a count of Congressional terms that a Representative had served (Poole and
Rosenthal 1997). We collected information on whether the Congressperson was a member of the
House Finance Committee, whether the Congressional Representative was a member of the
House Democratic or Republican leadership (defined as Speaker of the House, Majority Leader,
Minority Leader, Majority Whip or Minority Whip).5

We also coded whether each

Representative received campaign contributions from New Century during a Congressional
term.6

To determine each Representative’s race (African American or Hispanic), we used

information from the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses.
Finally, the data set includes zip code controls from the 2000 Census of Population and
Housing. Those controls included attributes of the zip code population including percent black,
percent Hispanic, percentage of adults with at least a college degree, and log population density.
We used data from US Census County Business Patterns dataset for the years 2003 to 2006 to
compute annual log zip code annual employment.

This time varying variable captures local

economic growth. While our key regressions below will include state/year/month fixed effects,
this additional zip code/year employment variable captures additional local labor market effects.
The analysis is undertaken using the universe of New Century loans originated over the
2003 – 2006 period. The spatial distribution of the New Century loan originations between 2003

In the results reported below, we have also re-estimated them limiting the sample to households who live in a zip
code that is completely located within a Congressional District. We find that our key results are almost identical
when we compare our whole sample results to the results based on this subsample of the data.
5 In 2006, this set included Blunt, Boehner, Delay, Hoyer and Pelosi. Information on congressional committee
assignment is available at http://financialservices.house.gov/archives/.

and 2006 is depicted in Figures 1 and 2.

We calculate each Congressional District’s share of

loans and these shares sum to 1. To ease the presentation, we partition these shares into five
quintiles with the darkest shading representing the areas that receive the greatest shares of New
Century loans.
As shown in Figure 1, New Century origination activity largely was confined to the
western United States and Florida.

In Figure 2, we repeat this exercise for California but the

unit of analysis is a zip code and the zip code shares sum to 1. New Century made 27% of its
total loans to California. As shown in Figure 2, California subprime lending was limited among
expensive and highly supply constrained coastal markets and instead focused on affordable,
relatively supply elastic housing parts of the Central Valley and the Inland Empire.

The

geographic incidence of subprime lending in the major coastal metropolitan areas of California
took a similar form. Both in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Los Angeles metropolitan area,
subprime originations were clustered in fast-growing and more highly affordable districts to the
east, relative to the expensive coastal areas. Also notable in Figure 2 was the high concentration
of subprime loans in the minority neighborhoods of eastern Contra Costa County as well as
Northeast and South Los Angeles.
As shown in Table 1, the sample is comprised of approximately 892,000 individual
subprime loan records.7 Of those records, about 63 percent were adjustable-rate mortgages with
an average nominal loan amount of $176,000. Subprime loan origination interest rates averaged
8.13 percent over the study period; average origination rates ranged from 7.60 percent in 2004 to
8.83 percent in 2006. Among sampled New Century borrowers, about 61 percent were male

7

We drop observations if no initial interest rate is reported or if the FICO score is missing. We limit the sample to
borrowers ages 20 to 75.

with an average age of about 42. As would be anticipated, average FICO scores among sampled
subprime borrowers were relatively low at 620 with mean household incomes of about $84,000.
Further, typical borrower combined loan-to-value ratio was about 86 percent. As is evident,
subprime mortgages were disproportionately originated among minority borrowers and in
minority neighborhoods. Blacks and Hispanics each comprised roughly 20 percent each of total
New Century originations. New Century loans were originated in zip codes comprised on
average of 13 percent black and 19 percent Hispanic population.
Sampled subprime borrowers resided in Congressional Districts typically represented by
longstanding incumbents; the average number of terms of the local Congressional representative
was close to 6. Finally, as shown in Table 1, only a small fraction of sampled New Century
borrowers, on order of 6 – 9 percent, were represented by Hispanic or Black Members of
Congress, respectively.

New Century donated to the campaigns of roughly 11 percent of

Congressional Representatives; roughly 15 percent of loans came from districts represented by a
member of the House Finance Committee.

New Century was more likely to donate to the

campaign contributions of the Leaders of Congress, members of the Finance Committee, and to
representatives whose communities featured higher shares of blacks and Hispanics. California’s
representatives were also more likely to receive such contributions.
III.

Empirical Analysis
In this section, we undertake detailed assessment of origination and pricing of subprime

loans by New Century Financial Corporation. Broadly, we hypothesize that in absence of
opportunity for explicit trades, the spatial distribution of New Century subprime mortgage
extensions and pricing varied systematically with the characteristics of and the contributions to
Congressional Representatives that New Century was seeking to influence.

Accordingly,

controlling for the usual borrower, loan, and locational characteristics, we test whether the
Congressional Representative’s race, political ideology, tenure in office, committee assignments,
leadership roles, and receipt of New Century campaign contributions were associated with
subprime access. We undertake similar analyses of subprime loan risk-based pricing.
3.1

HMDA Loan Origination Models
We first assess the role of Congressional political controls in determination of mortgage

lending outcomes among a broad cross-section of applicants and lenders. For this purpose, we
turn to the micro data files of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for the year 2006. Those
HMDA files often are utilized to characterize mortgage lending trends in the US; our crosssection includes in excess of 920,000 loans (a 2% random sample).8 In this analysis, we
augment standard controls available in the HMDA data with those accounting for neighborhood
and Congressional Representative effects in assessment of application accept/reject decisions.
Explanatory variables include a vector of census tract level controls based on year 2000 Census
data, including proportion black, proportion Hispanic, proportion having earned at least a college
degree, log population density, and log annual employment. Also, we add information on
attributes of the local Congressional representative, including whether the Congressperson was a
member of the House of Representatives Finance Committee, whether the Congressional
Representative was a member of the House Leadership and whether that Representative received
campaign contributions from New Century.

Also, the specification includes controls for

Representative race, terms in office, and conservative political ideology. Note that the analysis
pertains to a single year (2006) and controls as well for state-level fixed effects. Further, the
8

We include only first mortgage residential loan for occupied properties and drop observations for which
we do not observe the household’s income or location and we drop observations for whom the listed
action type is greater than 3.

analysis is stratified among prime and sub-prime loans. Given the above described federal
policy focus on mortgage origination and homeownership attainment among underserved and
minority households, we also stratify the sample among black and Hispanic applicants. Using
the published HUD subprime lender list we stratify lenders into two sets; prime and subprime
lending institutions. 9
In Table 2, we report six estimates of the linear probability model reported in equation 1.
The dependent variable equals one if person i in state l in census tract z in congressional district j
is rejected for a loan. The dependent variable has a mean of .19.
reject ijlz   l   1 X i   2 Z jl   3Tract lz   ijlz

(1)

where  is a vector of state fixed effects for state l, X a vector household attributes, Z a vector of
Congressional Representative attributes and Tract a vector of census tract attributes. The
standard errors are clustered by Congressional representative.
Note first the role of borrower and neighborhood characteristics in determination of
origination decisions among prime lenders (see columns 1-3).

As indicated, the discrete

dependent variable takes on a value of 1 if the loan application is rejected. As would be
expected, higher levels of applicant or census tract income serve to significantly depress loan
rejection probabilities. Similarly is the case for male applicants. On the other hand, consistent
with substantial literature in mortgage lending (see, for example, Deng and Gabriel (2006) and
Gabriel and Rosenthal (2009), black and Hispanic applicant status and black and Hispanic census
tract population shares all serve to significantly elevate rejection likelihoods among prime
lenders. Among political controls, Representative membership in the House of Representative’s
Finance Committee serves to elevate loan denials.
9

Our data source used for this partition is available at http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/manu.html.

Results for the set of subprime lenders are roughly similar to those described above for
prime lenders. As would be expected, for both black and Hispanic applicants, increases in
borrower and neighborhood income also serve to significantly damp loan denials among
subprime lenders. Whereas status as a black applicant or higher black census tract population
share serve to significantly elevate the probability of loan denial among subprime lenders, status
as a Hispanic applicant had the opposite effect. In the unified analysis, among subprime lenders,
none of the political controls appeared significant in determination of lending outcomes.
As shown in column (5), black applicants who apply for a loan at a subprime lending
institution are four percentage points less likely to be rejected if they live in a Congressional
Leader’s district. This results stands in marked contrast to findings for black prime applicants
and for both prime and subprime Hispanic applicants, where no significant effect of
Congressional leadership was evidenced. Noteworthy as well were the significantly damped
loan denial rates among Hispanic prime and sub-prime loan applicants represented by a political
conservative.

All things equal, these findings suggest that proxies for political influence,

including representation by a conservative Congressperson or Congressional leader, appear to
significantly enhance the mortgage loan origination probabilities of black subprime and Hispanic
applicants.10

3.2

New Century Loan Origination by Race and Ethnicity
We turn next to assessment of the role of Congressional influence on loan origination and

pricing outcomes among New Century borrowers. As discussed below, the richness of the New
10

In results available on request, we have used the 2006 HMDA data to estimate linear probability models in which
the dependent variable equals one if New Century originated the loan. We cannot reject the hypothesis that New
Century is equally likely as other subprime banks to originate the loan in the Congressional Leadership districts.
This suggests that there was competition among the banks to curry favor with powerful leaders.

Century dataset allows substantial borrower and locational controls. In this section, we estimate
linear probability models to assess the role of Congressional representative attributes in
determination of loan origination probabilities among black and Hispanic New Century
borrowers. The dependent variable in the analyses equals 1 if the originated loan is to a black
[Hispanic] borrower and zero otherwise. We seek to test whether conditional that New Century
has made a loan, is a minority more likely to receive it as a function of Congressional attributes.
We estimate equation (2).
Minority ijlzt   lt   1 X it   2 Z jlt   3 Zip lzt   ijlzt

(2)

In equation (2), the notation represents person i in state l in zip code z at time t in
Congressional district j. State/year/month fixed effects are included and the standard errors are
clustered by Congressional district.11 As shown in Table 3, the analysis includes a standard set
of borrower characteristics including borrower age, gender, log household income, and FICO
score.12 We add a further control for loan-to-value ratio. The regression also includes the zip
code level neighborhood and Congressional representative controls described above.
Table 3 reports results of the New Century loan origination equations.13 As shown in the
table, the controls for borrower and loan characteristics performed as expected. All things equal,
the probability of loan origination among blacks and Hispanics increased with loan LTV. While
increases in borrower age served to significant elevate loan origination probabilities among
blacks, the opposite was evidenced for Hispanics. As expected, increases in borrower income
11

While we include state/year/month fixed effects in all of the New Century regressions, it is relevant to note that
the New Century data are bunched across months. We observe 95% of the loans being recorded in April, August
and December.
12

We include four spline segments for the FICO score with the knots taking place at the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles of the empirical distribution at 579, 623 and 662 respectively.
13

The New Century data for Hispanic status is not filled in for the year 2003. This fact leads us to limit the sample
to 2004 through 2006 for the estimates of econometric models for the Hispanic subsample.

served to significantly diminish the probability of New Century loan originations among blacks
and Hispanics. Further, damped origination probabilities were associated with black borrowers
across the FICO credit score spectrum.
Results similarly affirm the significance of a broad set of neighborhood socio-economic
and race characteristics in determination of New Century subprime loan originations. Findings
largely indicate that increases in college graduate population shares, log neighborhood
population density, and log neighborhood annual employment serve to significantly elevate New
Century originations among blacks and Hispanics. While increases in black neighborhood
population share served to raise the probability of loan origination among blacks, increases in
Hispanic neighborhood population shares were associated with damped lending probabilities to
blacks. In a similar vein, increases in Hispanic neighborhood population share served to raise
the likelihood of New Century lending to Hispanics, while increases in black population share
had a damping effect.
Controlling for borrower, loan, and neighborhood characteristics as well as
state/year/month fixed effects, the political controls offer new insights as to the role of political
influence in determination of New Century loan originations among blacks and Hispanics.
Indeed, consistent with findings of the HMDA analysis, New Century lending to blacks was
significantly elevated in districts represented by Congressional leaders (nine percentage
points).14

That being said, lending to blacks was damped in districts represented by an

ideological Conservative. All things equal, other factors including controls for race/ethnicity of
local representative and New Century donation to representative did not significantly affect loan
originations among blacks. An exception arises in the case of Hispanics. Here representation by
14

To explain our findings based on unobserved borrower quality, one would need to explain why blacks with high
unobserved borrower quality self select to live in the Leader districts. Given the rich set of individual demographica
and zip code controls and our state/time fixed effects, we do not believe that this is a credible explanation.

a black Congressperson significantly diminished the likelihood of New Century loan originations
among Hispanics.
3.3

New Century Mortgage Pricing
In Table 4, we assess the effects of Congressional political controls on the pricing of New

Century mortgages. The analysis is based on the full set of loans originated by New Century
over the 2003-2006 period. The dependent variable is the log of the loan origination rate
charged by New Century for person I in state l in year/month t who lives in zip code z located in
Congressional District j. We estimate equation (3).
log( price ijlzt )   lt   1 X it   2 Z jlt   3 Zip lzt   ijlzt

(3)

The OLS regressions include proxies for borrower, loan, and neighborhood attributes.
Also, the models include state, year, and month fixed effects to account for time variations in
risk-free benchmark rates, locational variations in default and prepayment risk, and the like.
Borrower attributes taken from New Century loan records include borrower race, age, gender,
log household income, and FICO score spline. Also included is loan-to-value at time of loan
origination. Neighborhood controls derive from the 2000 Census and include zip code racial
distribution (percent black, percent Hispanic), percent college educated, population density, and
log total employment in the zip code in that year. Pricing controls are identical to those specified
in the New Century loan origination equations. Similarly, we stratify the pricing models by
borrower race and ethnicity. The standard errors are clustered by congressional district.
Findings as regards the borrower and loan effects were largely as anticipated. In all
models, higher LTVs, proxying higher levels of default risk, served to significantly increase loan
pricing. Among Hispanics, older borrowers were associated with significantly higher mark-ups
in pricing at loan origination, whereas male borrowers were associated with significantly lower

loan pricing. In contrast, among black borrowers, perceived default risk and hence risk premia
did not significantly vary with age and gender of borrower. Log household income also was
associated with significantly higher loan interest rates. As expected, as a primary indicator of
borrower credit risk, increases in borrower FICO score were highly significantly associated with
lower mortgage loan interest rates. Those results were evidenced for the sample as a whole as
well as for the black and Hispanic sample stratifications.
Similarly, neighborhood controls largely performed as expected. Higher proportions of
zip code college grads, suggestive of higher levels of financial literacy and lower default risk,
were associated with significantly lower New Century mortgage prices throughout. Again,
consistent with the established mortgage literature, findings suggest significantly elevated New
Century mortgage interest rates in neighborhoods with higher proportions of black population.
In marked contrast, increases in neighborhood proportion Hispanic population were associated
with significantly lower rates of New Century risk-based mortgage pricing. Note that the
findings regarding black and Hispanic neighborhood pricing effects were robust across the black
and Hispanic borrower sample stratifications.
Controlling for these well-established determinants of loan pricing as well as
state/year/month fixed effects, we focus on the role of Congressional influence in determination
of New Century mortgage loan origination rates.15 As shown at the bottom of Table 4, the
Congressional attributes are jointly statistically significant at the 1% in all three regressions. As
shown in the left column for the entire sample, all else equal, borrowers in districts represented
by a Congressional Leader received a 1.4% discount on the interest rate.16 Given that the

Dennis Hastert of Ohio offers a suggestive data point. In 2006, he was no longer a member of the Congressional
leadership. In regressions available on request, we have re-estimated equation (3) and included a Hastert Dummy

average loan amount was $200,000 and the average interest rate was 8 percent, this works out to
an annual household savings of roughly $150. Also, as evidenced in the left-hand column of
Table 4, borrowers who lived in districts where New Century made campaign contributions to
the Representative received a .7% reduction in their loan rate. One explanation for these loan
discounts is that subprime banks are competing with each other to increase market share for
loans with specific powerful representatives. This strategic competition lowers interest rates that
marginal borrowers are charged.
In Table 4, we also re-estimate equation (3) for the black borrower and Hispanic
borrower subsamples. As shown in the middle column, black borrowers receive 2.4 percent
reduction in mortgage interest rate if they live in a Congressional Leader’s district. Hispanic
borrowers receive a 1.2 percent reduction in mortgage pricing if they live in a district where New
Century has made a campaign contribution to the Representative. One notable non-result is that
the race of the Representative is not a statistically significant correlate of receiving a loan
discount.
3.4 New Century Loan Size Analysis
Finally, we report on the effects of Congressional influence on New Century credit
provision (loan dollar magnitude) at origination. We estimate equation (4).
log( loan ijlzt )   lt   1 X it   2 Z jlt   3 Zip lzt   ijlzt

(4)

The regressions include an identical set of controls as those described above for the pricing and
loan origination analyses.

As shown in Table 5, controlling for borrower, loan, and

neighborhood characteristics, log mortgage loan size is 9 percent larger in Congressional
and a Hastert*2006 Year dummy. Along with the leader dummy, these variables are jointly statistically significant
with a F-statistic of 7.51. Based on the coefficient estimates, we find that the price discount received by New
Century borrowers in his district shrunk towards zero when he was no longer part of the leadership.

Leadership districts and this differential grows to a full 18 percent for black borrowers (see
column 2). In contrast, among Hispanic borrowers, log loan size was significantly reduced in
districts presented by a Hispanic representative or a political conservative.17
Conclusion
In this paper, we explore the role of Congressional influence in extension and pricing of
subprime mortgage credit. Specifically, we apply loan level data from both HMDA and New
Century Financial Corporation, a major subprime lender, we assess whether attributes of
Congressional Representatives were associated with access to and pricing of subprime loans.
Noteworthy among HMDA results is the significant reduction in subprime loan denials among
black applicants in Districts represented by a Congressional leader. The HMDA data further
reveal significantly damped loan denial rates associated with seniority of Congressional
representative (terms in office) for both prime and subprime Hispanic borrowers.
We build on the HMDA findings using well-articulated New Century micro data.
Research findings for New Century indicate higher likelihoods of subprime loan origination as
well as significantly lower mortgage interest rates among borrowers represented by the
Republican and Democratic leadership in Congress.

Black borrowers also benefitted from

significantly larger loan amounts in those same districts. Also, borrowers residing in districts
where New Century donated to the local Congressional Representative received rate discounts.
Together with results of Mian et al (2010), our findings suggest a consistent pattern of
Congressional Representative political geography in subprime lending. New Century may have
viewed direction of campaign contributions to particular Representatives as well as enhancement
17

We also run points regressions where the dependent variable is the payment to the bank divided by the value of
the initial loan. In those analyses, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that our set of political variables is jointly
statistically insignificant. Results of the points analyses are available upon request.

of subprime credit access in those or other Congressional Districts as consistent with profit
maximization, to the extent it helped to buy Congressional support for widespread proliferation
of this controversial lending instrument among less qualified borrowers. At the same time, local
direction of mortgage capital may have served to elevate Representative political capital among
constituents, given provision of mortgage finance to constituent households previously excluded
from homeownership attainment. As boom turned to bust, Congressional proponents of the
mortgage credit boom likely rushed to support legislation aimed at foreclosure relief for those
same constituents.

Political factors, including direction of campaign contributions and

Representative-specific allocation of mortgage finance, provide important new insights as
regards the political geography of subprime lending.

Findings suggest that Congressional

leaders as well as recipients of New Century campaign contributions may have benefited from
gains to trade in the direction, pricing, and sizing of subprime mortgage loans.
