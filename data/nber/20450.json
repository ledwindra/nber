    "abstract": "\n\nOver the years, there emerged two key policy differences between Europe and America, both welfare and migration-states. The former has more generous welfare state and more liberal migration policies than the latter. In this paper we attempt to provide a political-economy   explanation for these key differences, based on the degree of coordination among member states of the economic union, and the different levels of population aging.\n\n",
