Utilitarianism and Horizontal Equity:
The Case for Random Taxation

ABSTRACT

This paper establishes that, far from being able to derive the principle
of horizontal equity from utilitarianism, the principle is actually in-

consistent with utilitarianism in a variety of circumstances. We derive
conditions under which (a) it is optimal to impose random tax schedules
(ex post randomization); and (b) it is optimal to randomize the tax schedules
imposed on a set of otherwise identical individuals (ex ante randomization).

The implications for optimal tax theory are discussed. More generally,
it is shown that there are a number of potentially important economic
situations with which the principle of horizontal equity may be inconsistent not only with utilitarianism but even with Pareto optimality.

UTILITARlAISM AND HORIZONTAL EQUITY:
THE CASE FOR IANDOM TAXATION*

by
Joseph E. Stiglitz

1. ntroduct ion
The

concept

of horizontal equity has long had a special place

in public finance. In particular, the iiposition of a'ndo Lax
would generally be viewed to be unfair. Most econonists

would say that such a tax is "hoizontaily inequitable. More
sophisticated

econornistc night distinguish between cx ante horlzontal

equity and cx post horizontal equity: if the tax were acplied in

a

truly random way, then cx ante it would be horizontally equitable;
individuals with identical utility functions and endowments would have

identical

ex ante expected utility, since they all face equal chances;

x post, it would be horzontally inequitable since individuals with the
same endowments and tastes may have very different values of realized

it is ex post horizontal equity

in

which we are interested. (These

arguments cannct be pushed oo far: the draft lottery can be thought
of as a random tax applied to a particular subgroup of the population,
and it did receive widespread —— though far from universal ——

acceptance.)

Indeed, so basic is the notion of horizontal equity that It is
incorporated in the Constitution (jf the United States in the 3tequal

protection clause.T' The government may not treat. differently individuals

who are, for the purposes at hand, otherwise identical.
Horizontal equity is usually presented ac a principle in its

own right. It is not derived from other principles. Nor is there
any discussicn of the relationship of this principle with other

principles. For instance, is it ever inconsistent with Pareto optimality?
If it is, does one of the principles have priority over the other?
In recent years there has developed a large literature on optimal
tax structures, using a utilitarian (or more general, social welfare)

criterion.' This approach provides a simple and useful framework
within which altnrriativ structures can be evaluated. Most of this
literature has, however, ignored the question of horizontal equity.2
The question naturally arises, can the principles of horizontal equity
be derived from a utilitarian (or more gei.ieral social welfare) criterion?

See for instance, Ramsey (1927), Diamond and Mirrlees (1971), Stiglitz
and Dasgupta (1971), Atkinson and Stiglitz (1972), and Nirrices (1971).

The object of this paper is to show that it cannot) Indeed,
we establish that the principle of horizontal equity may be inconsistent

with utilitarianism. That is, social welfare (as measured by the sum
of utilities) is higher if individuals who have the same tastes and

the same endowments are treated differently.2 Even more strongly, we show
that horizontal equity may be inconsistent with the principle of
Pareto opt imality.

Most of our analysis is focused on the desirability of random

taxation.

We show that random taxation may lead to a Pareto improvement.

The implications of our analysis extend, however, to a wide variety of

social decisions. Thus, in Section 6 we present several other contexts
in which horizontal equity is either inconsistent with social welfare
maximization (utilitarianism) or with Pareto optimality; and In Section 9,

we discuss briefly the implications of our results for earlier analyses
of optimal tax structures.

Our analysis also has implications for pricing policies of

monopolists: in Section 8 we show that it may be desirable for
regulated and unregulated monopolists to randomize prices.

At least from the form of utilitarianism represented in the optimal
tax literature, See below, Section 9.
2

The same results may be obtained wltn other social welfare functions
as well.

That horizontal equity may not he consistent with Pareto optimality
is perhaps not as surprising as it first sounds — the familiar story
of the two shipwrecked sailors with only enough food for one (so horizontal
equIty entaIls both dying) at least shows the possibility of a contradiction. We are suggesting that conflict among these principles is more
common than such exanpies may suggest.

—4—

We conclude with some speculative remarks about the implications
of our results for the role of the concept of horizontal equity in the
analysis of questions of public policy.

2. Utilitarianism and Horizontal Equicy: The Conventional View
The intuitive derivation of the principle of horizontal equity
from utilitarianism is a special application of Lerner's (1944) argument for

progressive taxation. Assume two individuals 'A' and "B" have identical
incomes and utility functions

UA(cA)

uB(cB) i cA

where C is the i—th individual's consumption:

Ci =Yi —i
where

is his income and T is his tax payment. Thus, if we

Foundations will attest, every well behaved problem is concave. The
modern corollary of Marshall's dictum that nature abhors discontinuities
is that nature abhors non—concavities, and it is this, I suspect, that
provides the intuitive rationale for the widespread belief in equality
and

the

belief that the belief in equality can be justified by

utilitarianism.

1

It is my belief, on the contrary, that a variety of problems of
economic irterest exhibit non—concavities of the sort that imply that
social welfare maximization may require unequal treatment of equals.
Such is the case of indirect taxation to which we now turn.

We consider two versions of the problem of random taxation. In
the first, the individual knows his tax rate before he decides on
his labor inputs, in the second, he is only told his tax rate after
he has supplied his labor (although he knows the probability dis-

tribution of tax rates before he decides on his labor supply.) In
both cases, randomization may be desirable, although the conditions

under which it will be desirable differ in the two cases. In both
cases, we focus on the desirability of a small degree of randomization;
that is, we provide conditions in which a slight randomization in
the tax rate would lead to Pareto improvement (in terms of cx ante
expected utility); it should be noted that there may be cases where

1

Since, as we shall show, this belief is not correct, one can only
surmise why someone might have come to such a belief. Talks with
economists a a large number of institution3 lead ma to believe
that some argument, such as that given here, though usually slightly less
formally presented, lies behind their conclusion.

—6—

a slight randomization would not be desirable, but a "large" randomi-

zation would. Thus, the case for randomization of taxes is ronger
than that presented here.

3. Randomization of Taxes Prior to Labor Decision

3.1 The Model
In this and the next section we consider the simplest possible

model of indirect taxation: there is a single good (C) and lhor
(L). We assume that in the absence of taxation, the wage is unity
and the price of output is unity (this is just a normalization)

and that output is proportional to labor input. Let T be the tax
rate and p the (after tax) price of consumption goods (relative to

labor numeraire). Then1

(3.1)

p = 1

T

We write the indirect utility function

(3.2)

V V(p,I)

max U(C,L)
s.t. pC < L + I

There is no lump sum taxation, and no profits, so income apart from

that generated by work is zero;2 hence I

0. Wa can easily derive

the individual's consumption function, using Roy's identity,

C =

C(p,I)

=

— V(p,I)/V1(p,I)

For simplicity, we assume that the price of tput remains unchanged
throughout the analysis (the production technology 'is 1.Lnear.) The
results are, however, more general.
2

The result extends to the case where there is lump sum taxatioii but
distortlonary taxation is also employed. Thus, the results may be
extended in a straightforward way to linear income tax schedules,
See below, Section 5.

—7 -

Assume, for simplicity, there are two identical individuals. We
wish to maximize social welfare by choosing a pobability distribu4op,
of tax rates on consumption.. We focus on the simplest case where
one individual will face a low tax rate and the other individual will

face a high tax rate. We randomize the taxes, so each individual has

(A — 1)

exactly an equal chance of facing the high tax rate

the low tax rate (B —

and

Thus, his expected utility can be

as
w =

A
V(p ,O)

+

B

V(p,O)

Since the two individuals are identical, maximizing ex ante expected

utility is equivalent to maximizing social welfare using any individualistic
social welfare criterion. Moreover, if we use a utilitarian criterion,
maximizing ex ante expected utility is equivalent to maximizing the
sum of (ex post) utilities, i.e.

vA(pA0) + VB(PB

,O)

where superscripts A and B refer to the different individuals.
In either interpretation, we need to maximize W subject to

the

constraint that the government raise the requisite revenue:

3.4 Intuitive Interpretation in Terms

of

Excess Burden

The basic intuition behind our argument can be seen as follows.
In Figure 3.2a we have plotted the excess burden (EB) (deadweight loss) imposed on an

individual as a function of the revenue raised from him.

Clearly, if

the curve is concave at the required revenue, R, it pays to introduce
some randomizaticn, for then average excess burden will be reduced.
a sufficient condition for random taxation to be desirable is that

Thus

(EB,T/l +

where

EB,T =

the elasticity Oi excess burden with respect

d in T

to the tax rate.

This can be rewritten equivalently as

EB T —i

d in c

dlnp

As igure 3.2b illustrates, the percentage incrent in excess burden from
an increase in the tax rate will be small if the consumption demand
curve is convex.

These conditions can perhaps be interpreted more easily in terms

of a tax on labor. Let t be the tax on labor, and

L be labor supply.

Then, we obtain as before that randomization is desirable if

dlnEB=dlnEB

dlnR dint / /dlnR
Thus some randomization is desirable if

the elasticity of the excess burden with respect to the tax rate
is less than one plus the elasticity of the labor supply with respect

Notice that it is the uncompensated elasticities which are relevant
here, for it is the uncompensated elasticities which are critical in
determining the shape of the revenue function.

3.5 An Alternative Interpretajon
There

is an alternative interpretation that will prove useful

in some of the subsequent discussion. In Figure 3.3 we have depicted
the relationship between the revenue raised from an individual

(by

means of a proportional consumption tax) and the utility he attains.
(The curve

the

is

derived from plotting, in the lower right hand quadrant,

relationship between the revenue raised and the tax rate, and in

upper left hand quadrant, the relationship between the utility attained
and

the tax rate.) This utility—revenue curve

may not be concave;

clearly, if it is not, we can increase average utility by concavifying
the

curve (as in the diagran).

To collect the average revenue R, it is
from some individuals and the

3.7 Randomization of Optimal Linear Income Taxes
In the simple model we have developed here, with identical
individuals, there is no real reason to impose a distortionary tax:

a uniform lump sum tax would clearly be preferable. It is only because
individuals differ, say, in their abilities, but these differences are
not directly observable, that we need to resort to distortionary taxation.

(See Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976, 1980).) Our analysis can be easily
extended to show that the optimal linear tax structure involves randomization
of the marginal tax rate on consumption.
To see this, assume we have a distribution of individuals by ability

(before tax real wage) given by G(w)) With a linear tax structure, the
individual's budget constraint is given by

C1+(l—t)wL
where I is the lump sum payment to each individual and t is the
marginal tax rate. The individual's utility is represented by his
indirect utility function, now written as a function of the after tax
wage rate and the lump sum payment,

always a critical point, but it may

be a local minimum rather than a local maximum. We can derive expressions
analogous to (3.13) and (3.14) ——

but

——

providing

sufficient conditions for randomization.

There is one problem with the implementation of the kind of random
tax scheme we have described in this section.

Since whether the individual will be faced with a low or a high
tax rate is an insurable risk with no moral hazard associated with it,
clearly individuals would be willing to purchase insurance to reduce this

risk. If perfect insurance were purchased, the individual's behavior
would be identical to that with no randomization, and obviously then

randomization would have no effect. Thus, it is apparent tha social

l C —

optimality

requires, in this case, restrictions on the set of insurance

markets which are allowed to operate)

4. Randomization of Taxes After Labor Decision
The reason that random taxation was desirable in the previous
section was, roughly, that the amount of revenue raised increased more
than proportionately to the tax because of the differences in response
of labor supply to different after tax wages. Thus, the average tax
rate could be reduced by having some individuals face a high tax
rate and some a low rate.

In this section, we consider the case where the individual must

decide on his labor input prior to knowing the tax. If the individual
is risk averse, he will "plan" on facing a high tax rate, and hence each
individual will reduce his labor suppiy by less than he otherwise

would; this enables the average tax rate to be reduced. Individuals are

There may be no scope for insurance of the conventional kind (the
individual pays so much to the insurance company if his tax rate is low,
receiving some fixed amount if his tax rate is high). Whether such
policies are desirable, and the nature of these policies, depends on
the value of V1. If V1 0, as it may (the marginal utility of income
does not depend on the real wage), then there is no scope for such insurance

contracts. If V < 0, then the insurance contract actually leads the
indIvidual with the higher tax rate to pay money to the individual with
the lower tax rate. With normal demand curves, this would decrease the
desirability of randomizaton of a consumption tax, since it will redistribute
consumptiou away frL.m highly taxed indijidu.als. The inaurancconjracts
may make randomization undesirable, and ttie government may need to
intervene to restrict such insurance markets.

worse off because they face the risk arising from the random tax.

They are better off because they face a lower average tax rate. We
shall show that this second effect can dominate the first; randomization
may increase everyone's ex ante expected utility.

It is more convenient in this section to take th2 tax as

one on labor; the individual is assumed to face the tax rate t + A
with probability .5, and

t

A with probability .5, where A > 0.

Now, we take the price of output as our numeraire (p =

in after tac wages increases or decreases labor supply (Rothschild—
Stiglitz (1971)),depending on the concavity or convexity of the

first order condition (U1w + U2 = 0) in terms of the wage

w.

(The change in the after tax wage is a mean—preserving spread in

the wage distribution.) Clearly, a necessary condition for the
desirability of randomization is that risk increases labor supply

(a2L/A >

0).

(Later we provide conditions ensuring that this will occur.)

(b) The responsiveness of labor supply to taxes. The more
that an increase in taxes reduces labor supply, the greater the return

from being able to reduce the (average) tax rate, and thus the more
likely that randomization will be desirable.

(c) The size of the required tax revenues R. When t = 0,

—24—

These results, like those of the preceding section, may seem

rather counterintuitive: after all, one is imposing more risk on the

individual. Yet, remarkably enough, the condition we

have

derived

(in the simple case of separable utility functions) suggests that
randomization may be attractive even with high risk aversion.

There are two effects of randomization. First, it imposes a risk
on individuals. By the usual kinds of arguments, the welfare loss

can be sho to be of the order of (for small risks)

pA2/2. At the

same time, it affects labor supply; the change in aggregate labor
supply affects the (average) tax rate; changing the average tax rate

changes the deadweight loss associated with the tax. The deadweight
loss is approximately

Thus, the deadweight loss is inversely related (for constant elasticity
supply functions of labor) to the aggregate labor supply.

If aggregate

supply increases when we randomize, i.e. if — > 0 is sufficiently
large, then the effect of the benefit from reduction in the average tax
rate is greater than the lOSS from the induced risk.

—25—

One interpretation of the kind of random taxation we have discussed

in this section is the random enforcement of taxes. (Fixed costs of

auditing increase the desirability of random audits.) This interpretation has been discussed at greater length by Weiss (1976)

5. The Randomization of the Optimal Tax and Optimal Randomization
In the preceding two sections we established the desirability of

randomization for linear tax structures. In this section, we ask, what
can we say about optimal randomization of linear tax structures, on the
one hand, and the randomization of optimal non—linear tax structures,
on the other.

Thus reformulated, this is simply a linear maximization problem

5.2 Ex Post and Ex Ante Randomization
In the two preceding sections, we analyzed separately ex post and

ex ante randomization. In fact, the optimal tax

structure

may entail

both simultaneously; that is, individuals are told, before they decide
on the level of effort, that they will face one of two

lotteries, one yielding, say, tA —

Given that ex post randomization

is desirable, the desirability of ex ante randomization may be analyzed

exactly as before, but now, for each avera level of tax, we calculate
the optimal random distribution and the associate level o expected
utility and average revenue.

5.3 Randomization withplTaxes
This paper has focused on the desirability of randomization when

the government is restricted to employing linear taxes. The question
naturally arises, is randomization desirable if this restriction is

removed? Does randomization, for Instance, arise simply because of the
second best nature of the problem?

—28—

On the contrary, it turns out that Pareto efficient taxation, with
individuals differing say by ability as in the model of Section 3.7
entails randomization under much weaker conditions than those derived

in the preceding two sections. The use of randomization enables the
government to distinguish between high and low ability individuals, at
a lower cost (in terms of the distortions imposed). The analysis of
this problem involves rather different techniques than those employed

here, and hence is taken up elsewhere. (See Stiglitz (1981).)l

Other Contexts where TJtiiitariaflisrn

There have been several other contexts in which utilitarianism
implies horzontal inequity:

Mirrlees (1975) and Stiglitz

(1976b) have analyzed the optimal distribution of income in a family
farm in which the productivity of the

—29—

A(w) gives the number of efficiency uns supplied by an individual
receiving a wage U

Optimality

in general entails some individuals

receiving a low wage, some a high wage. Indeed, introducing

inequality

may be ex post Pareto optimal. When everyone receives the same wage,
they are all unproductive, and output is low. Giving a few
individuals a lot more enables them to work so hard that not only
do they produce enough to provide the extra food that they consum.,
but they have some left over to give to the remaining low wage
individuals.

(b) The optimal town: Mirrlees (1972) has shown that in the optimal

the utilitarian solution entails inequality: individuals who
are randomly assigned to live further from the center enjoy more
town

land and have a higher level of utility. By crowding individuals
near the center, the transport costs of all those further out are
reduced, and this gain in efficiency more than offsets the inequality
generated thereby.

(c) Fixed training costs:1 Assume everyone is ex ante the
same,

and there are two types of jobs to be performed. One requires

training

costs T (denominated in say the labor numeraire). Thus, some

individuals are (randomly) assigned to the high training cost industry,

others to the low training cost industry. It can be shown that those individuals
who are (randomly) assigned to the industry requiring training will,
in the utilitarian optimum, work harder and have a lower level of utility.
By making these individuals work harder, expenditures on training
costs are reduced; in effect, net national product can be increased,

at the cost of some increase in inequality. Unless society has infinite
inequality

This problem was discussed in Stiglitz (1973).

—30—

These examples have one feature in common: they lack, in one
way or another, the concavity property which is required for utili-

tarianism to imply horizontal equity. In the first ("efficiency wage")
problem, inequality in income raises net national product by increasing
average productivity; in the third (training cost) probleffi, inequality
in the labor required of different individuals

raises net national

product by reducing the expenditure on training

cost; in the second

net national product by

In some situations, lifetime equality may be attained, even though

there is, at any moment, inequality. Thus, in the optimal town problem,
if it were costless to move individuals, we could rotate individuals

among plots of land so lifetime utilities were identical. But this

is not possible for the training cost problem. In the optimal tax problem,
if individuals can save, then again randomization may

entail

lifetime inequality.

In all of the situations examined, randomization is Pareto optimal:
ex ante expected utility is maximized by this kind of inequality.

Markets

and Inequality

It is thus not surprising that in situations
in this paper but arising in market contexts,
for the market to introduce randomization.

problem of financing specific training

such as those discussed

there will be a tendency

For instance, consider the

costs. The efficient way for the

firm to recover those training costs is to impose, in effect, a lump sum
tax on all workers, but this may not

be desirable; if individuals do not

know their ability prior to training, they would piefer an "income tax,"

i.e. a piece rate less than the value added.1 Assume for administrative reasons that the piece rate cannot be made a function of the number

of items produced (i.e. we must have a linear income tax.)2 Then
equilibrium may entail a random piece rate. Perhaps this provides
part of the explanation of random promotion policies (equivalent to
random wages) used by some universities.
Note that so long as individuals have a free choice of occupations,
the wage contract must entail individuals who are ex ante identical
receiving the same level of expected utility.

(Similarly, a developer developing a new residential town and selling
off the plots of land, could he better off (i.e. increase his profits)

by having a fixed fee for a plot, having the plots of different sizes,
and randomly assigning individuals to a plot.)

In the kind of situations we have depicted, the market allocation

may not be Pareto efficient for two reasons. First, it may be difficult
to enforce random contracts; in the example described earlier, with fixed
training

costs, the worker who receives training works harder, but receives

the same

wage, as the one who does not receive training. In such a situation,

there is obviously an incentive for some other firm to bid the worker away.
If it is not possible to restrict labor mobility, then the market equilibrium

The parallel between "income taxes" and "piece rates" is discussed at
greater length in Stiglitz (1975).

will

require that all (ex ante identical) individuals receive the same

level of utility (ex post); the market, in these situations, entails
excessive egalitarianism.
Second,

in the training cost problem presently under consideration,

the optimal resource allocation requires, in effect, subsidies from the
trained workers to the untrained, or conversely.

As we noted earlier,

if there were a single government—controlled firm, it would pay equal
wages to all workers, but randomly assign some workers to the plant not

requiring training and some to the plant requiring training. It would
require that the latter workers work harder (longer). Although the workers
so assigned might well complain, the cx ante expected utility of all workers

is maximized by this randomization. But the utilitarian allocation is not, in

general, viable under competition. For in general, the revenues
raised from the sale of one commodity will not be equal to the

expenditures on wages plus training costs: there will be a subsidy
in one direction or the other. It is obvious, then, that the equilibrium cannot be sustained by a laissez—faire competitive equilibrium.1

8. Random Pricing by Regulated and Non—Regulated Monopolies
It is by now well recognized that there is a close relationship
between the analysis of optimal tax structures (Ramsey and his
descendants) and the analysis of optimal pricing of public utilities

(Boiteux and his descendants). Thus, our remarks about the desirability
of random taxes apply directly to the problem of pricing of regulated
utilities.

1

For proof, see Stigiicz (1976a).

-33..

But our analysis also shows that there are conditions under which

an unregulated monopolist may find randomization desirable. We noted
earlier, for instance, that the maximiztion of government revenue may
entail randomization of prices (tax rates). Thus, if production were
controlled by a single monopolist, he would, in these circumstances,
randomize his prices.

Similarly, the optimal entry deterring strategy for a monopolisc
may entail randomizing its prices.

1

Consider a monopolistic firm wishing to maximize its revenue;

assume it has a long term contract with its customers; the contract
specifies the "price distribution" which it will charge (the commodity
is assumed not to be storable).

The customer has a reservation

expected utility level, i.e. at any contract yielding a lower level of
expected utility, he purchases a substitute for the given commodity.2
Then the problem of the monopolist is maximizing revenue subject
to this expected utility constraint as opposed to our problem,

maximizing expected utility, subject to a revenue constraint. Formally
the two problems are simply dual to each other. Thus under perfectly
analogous conditions to those presented here, the monopolist will find
it desirable to randomize his prices.

4See Salop (1979), Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1980) and Gilbert and Stiglitz
(1979) for more general discussions of entry deterrance.

Newbury (1978) has explored one version of this application of our
general r'odel.

9. Implications of our Analysis for the Theory_ps Optimal Taxation
and the Usefulness of the Concept of Horizontal Equity
Most of the literature in the theory of optimal taxation (surveyed
in Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980)) has focused on characterizing first

order conditions for the maximization of social welfare. Our analysis

has made it clear that this may be insufficient: under not unreasonable
circumstances these may characterize a local minimum rather than a
maximum.

Although we have formulated the problem in terms of two absolutely identical
individuals, the issues we have raised arose, in slightly disguised form,

in the standard opta1 tax problem. Consider, for instance, two
individuals one of wh2m.likes brown ice cream (but obtains zero
utility from white), the other of whom likes white ice cream. Assume

they have identical demand functions. Assume moreover that the costs
of production of white and brown ice creams are identical. Thus, if
T

b

is the tax rate on brown ice cream, T

that on white ice

cream, then in the conventional optimal tax problem, there may be three
critical points, at

Tb =

T

,

at Tb > T •

and at T b< T i.

One

might well consider solutions with Tb T horizontally inequitable,
but such a solution may be a local utilitarian maximum.

The optimal

tax structure is, in any reasonable sense, horizontally inequitable.

Many economists would, accordingly, reject the asymmetric
solution in which the two colors of ice cream are treated differently.
Presumably, a true beliaver in utilitarianism would not.
But let us now assume that there are, within the population, two

groups of indiiduals distinguished, say, only by hair color. Recall
that we showed earlier then there were two alternative interpretations

—35—

of our results. We focused on the situation where we treated all
individuals ex ante identically, and thus randomization was (cx ante)
Pareto optimal; but even if type A individuals always were taxed at
a higher rate, and type B individuals always were taxed at a lower
rate, social welfare (using the utilitarian ctiterion) was increased

as a result of taxing them at different rates. A strict utilitarian
would thus have no way of choosing between a tax system which randomized
taxes (resulting in identical ex ante expected utility) and one which
always taxed light haired individuals at a lower rate than dark haired
individuals; moreover, under the conditions provided in the earlier
analysis, he would argue that a tax system which differentiated
between light haired and dark haired individuals is preferable to
one which did not.

Is there a difference between the analysis of the tax treatment
of "brown" and "white" ice cream lovers, and the fair haired and dark

haired individuals with identical labor supply functions? The question,
seeiAngly, hinges on what are admissible distinctions. But there is,
within the utilitarian framework as it has customarily been applied
to the analysis of tax structures, no way of determining what are

and are not admissible distinctions. If hair color or sex is not
admissible, why should a seemingly equally capricious aspect of an
individual, the color which he likes his ice cream, be the basis of

differentiation? If the preferred color is not an admissible basis,
should the preferred flavor ——

chocolate

versus vanilla —— be admissible?

And if the choice among ice creams is not admissible, should the
choice between ice cream and cheese be an admissible1 basis, or the

The fact that the technology for prodl1cing two colors of ice cream
may be identical, while the techrto.Logies for producing cheese and !ee

cream are different, does nQt, I Hnk, provide a persuasive basis
for differentiation.

—36—

choice between goods and leisure? These issues have always been lurking
quietly in the background in the analytical discussions of the structure
of taxation; the point of the simple models presented in the first
two sections of the paper is to examine a context in which they cannot
be avoided, to present them in as pristine a form as possible.
There are, at this juncture, three approaches that can be taken.
(1) One

can

argue that any distinction is admissible; disriminatiofl

may well be optimal.

(2) Alternatively, one can define a set of admissible distinctions.
This unfortunately removes one of the great advantages of the utilitarian
approach to the analysis of tax structures; it presumes the existence
of a prior principle for the determination of the set of admissible
bases of differentiation.

How are we to know, then, that this prior

principle should not, at the same time, be reflected in the design
of the tax structure itself?
The same criticism can, of course, be levied against the principle

of horizontal equity itself. This is usually put as requiring that

1959). But what is meant by "equal positions":
vanilla ice cream lovers in equal positions?
that the critical question is, what are

(Musgrave,

admissible distinctions; the

principle of horizontal equity seems to provide little guidance. As
Rosen has pointed out (1978), "Customarily,

'equal positions' are defined

in terms of some observable index of ability to pay such as income,

expenditure, or wealth." But to choose say income or wealth as the
basis is virtually equivalent to defining

income as tiiC

horizontal

equitable tox; differential coundity taxes are, by defintior1, then
horjzontallY inequitable.

-.37—

This approach attempts to define "equal positions" in terms of
some opportunity sets (income or wealth are used as surrogates for

"ability to pay.") In contrast, Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and
Feldstein (1976) have taken a "welfare approach": As Feldstein has
put it,

"If two individuals would be equally well off
(have the same utility level) in the absence
of taxation, they should be equally well off
if there is taxation.
[Furthermore,] taxes should not alter the
utility ordering."

But this formulation too is not completely persuasive: first,
it requires a higher level of cardinality in the utility assessment

even than that required by the utilitarian approach. We must be able
to compare levels of utility as well as differences. Second,
let us consider what this definition implies for our chocolate—

vanilla ice cream example. If initially, the chocolate and vanilla
ice cream sell at the same price, then differential taxation is

horizontally inequitable. But now, assume that the cost of chocolate

is increased slightly. The chocolate lover is "disadvantaged." The
Feldstein formulation suggests not only that we could not use the tax
system to attempt to restore "equality" but that any taxes we impose
must result (if it is to be horizontally equitable) in chocolate

lovers being worse off than vanilla lovers. For example, assume that
the supply elasticity of chocolate is greater than that of vanilla.

—38—

A uniform lump sum tax might therefore result, in the new general
equilibrium, in the price of chocolate being below that of vanilla.
In the Feldstein definition, the uniform lump sum tax (which, given
that all individuals have the same endowments, would in the conventional
formulation be horizontally equitable) is thus horizontally inequitable.
In either formulation, virtually any tax system will have some
degree of horizontal inequity; one needs, then, to trade off horizontal

equity with other desiderata of a good tax system. One needs, then,
a Meta—principle for evaluating tax systems.1
3) Finally, we can attempt to retain the utilitarian approach,

but argue that the particular formulation in the current optimal tax

literature is inadequate. The governments ——

the

individuals who are

in the possession of the power to exercise the power to tax ——

are

not likely to impose a truly random tax. The existence of differential
treatment means that there will be incentives to bribe (in one way
or another) those in the power to determine who is to be treated

favorably. It is this belief in the corruptability of power which
may have provided the motivation for the restriction on differential

treatment in the American constitution. These considerations are,
I think, relevant in assessing alternative tax codes, e.g. in the
desirability of taxing different commodities at the same or different
rates.

1

There are ad hoc approaches defining an index of horizontal inequity
and an index of vertical equity, and positing a social welfare function
giving tradeoffs between the two. This seems close to assuming what
open to
is to be analyzed. The index used by King (1980) seems
the objections made above.

—39—

The dangers of differentiation lie not Only in the favorable
treatment that may be —— and have been ——

obtained by special interest

groups. Admitting the possibility that some commodity may be taxed
at a higher rate opens up the possibility of using the tax system as
an instrument for the (possibly mistaken) public wrath against one
industry or another.

Thus a utilitarian, assessing the advantages and disadvantages of
alternative tax systems, should take into account how such systems

would actually be implemented. It is within such a broader perspective
that some fonn of the principle of horizontal equity may well be consistent with
utilitarianism.

1

io. Rawis and Horizontal Equity
Some readers have suggested that there is a close relationship
between the principle of horizontal equity and Rawis' principle of justice.
And just as Rawis argues that justice takes precedence over other social

principles, so too should horizontal equity. Thus, one should not trade—
of f horizontal equity with other social objectives.

But our analysis has shown that each individual's expected utility

may be higher if he is confronted with a random tax structure. Thus,
behind the veil of ignorance, each would favor random taxation, if he
could be assured that the tax would be truly levied in a random way.

If this view is correct, then the kind of analysis of horizontal
equity contained in Feldstein, Rosen and King may not be focusing on
the critical issues. Within a general equilibrium context, changes
in taxes —- like changes in technology
affect different individuals
if they could he defined ——
very differently. Welfare rankings
may well be reversed. But there is notriing sacred about the pretax ranking. What we are concerned with is some notion of arbitrary
distinctions.

—40—

But the individual may

not

believe that the tax would be levied in

a truly random way. Indeed, aware of the corruptability of government,
he might reason that if the Constitution allows differential taxation
(of commodities, individuals, etc.) then the political process will

being advantaged relative to others, Simply

result in some individual

because of their ability to exercise political power. Thus differentiation
would clearly violate the principle of justice. And because it may not be
possible to write the Constitution in such a way that it would allow just
differentiation, but that it
may be preferable simply

to

would not allow unjust differentiation, it

restrict the ability of the government to

impose differential taxation.'

11. Concluding Remarks

This paper has established that, far from being able to derive
the principle of horizontal equity from utilitarianism, the principle
is actually inconsistent with utilitarianism in a variety of circumstances;
most notably, we have derived conditions under which random taxation is

optimal. Indeed, there are potentially important economic situations
where Pareto optimality and horizontal equity are inconsistent (in

both

an ex ante and ex post sense). Such inconsistencies force us to reevaluate our ethical principles: either utilitarianism or the principle

consistent with all consumption being taxed at the same rate, or with
all income being taxed at the same rate; the former is equivalent to a
wage tax, and thus implies that interest is exempt from taxation, while
the latter is equivalent to a tax on future consumption at a higher rate
than on a tax on present consumption.

of horizontal equity ——

at

least in the conventional forms —— must be

abandoned. We have suggested a more general utilitarian approach,
within which the two principles may be consistent, but which, at the
same time, casts considerable doubt on the optiniality of the kinds of

tax structures which have been derived within the conventional utilitarian
framework.
