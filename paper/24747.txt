ABSTRACT
Teacher value-added is not a technological ‘primitive.’ Instead, it increases within-teacher when
accountability incentives are strengthened, as we show. This evidence motivates a framework in
which teacher value-added depends on two unobserved inputs to education production: teacher
ability and incentive-varying teacher effort. We present a strategy to identify these two inputs
and their distinct effects on test scores for the first time, using exogenous incentive policy
variation and rich longitudinal data from North Carolina. The estimates indicate that both the
ability component of teacher value-added and teacher effort raise current and future scores. We
also find that effort responds systematically to incentives, underlining the agency of the teaching
force as an important factor in education production. To explore the policy implications of this
economic agency, we then use our estimates to compare the cost effectiveness of incentiveoriented education reforms with policies that target teacher ability. Incentive reforms come out
ahead in a variety of plausible cases, given their potential to influence all teachers rather than a
subset.

Introduction

In the quest for viable policies to improve public school outcomes, considerable attention has focused on teacher performance, informed by the ever-wider availability of detailed administrative
data sets that link students to their teachers. Leveraging such data, sophisticated teacher valueadded measures have been developed in an influential recent literature, intended to capture the
overall performance impact of a given teacher – see, for example, Kane and Staiger (2008) and
Chetty, Friedman and Rockoff (2014a,b).1 In turn, estimates of these value-added measures are
now the cornerstone of policy interventions that include, somewhat controversially, dismissing
low value-added teachers.
Teacher value-added (‘VA’) is not a primitive of the education production technology.2
Instead, it is natural to attribute teacher performance to a teacher’s ‘type’ (or ability) and
actions (or work effort), with effort likely to depend on the incentive environment.3 Yet teacher
ability and effort are typically not observed, and partly as a consequence, we do not have
estimates of the two education inputs or their longer-term impacts on a common footing. This
in turn inhibits policy design, making it difficult to compare the cost effectiveness of reforms
that target teacher effort versus teacher ability in any systematic way.
Motivated by these estimation and policy issues, our paper has two goals. On the estimation
front, we seek to develop an approach that allows both incentive-varying teacher effort and
incentive-invariant teacher ability to be identified along with their persistent effects for the first
time in the literature.4 The resulting estimates can provide insight into the respective shortand longer-term productivities of these education inputs, filling a gap in our knowledge of the
education process. They also have a bearing on the policy debate, as different reforms are likely
to be suitable for bringing forth different inputs. On that policy theme, our second goal is to set
out a quantitative means for comparing incentive reforms with relevant alternative education
policies, including policies that target teacher ability, drawing on the new estimates; we will do
1
The value-added literature builds on well-known studies – notably Rockoff (2004) and Rivkin, Hanushek and
Kain (2005) – using fixed effects methods to show convincingly that ‘teacher quality’ matters.
2
Consistent with this claim, recent empirical research shows clearly how teacher performance varies with
workplace characteristics – see Jackson and Bruegemann (2009) and Jackson (2013), for example. (Appendix A
provides a fuller review of this and other related literatures.)
3
This accords with evidence that accountability reforms in education have improved student achievement in
many settings – see Figlio and Loeb (2011) for a comprehensive survey.
4
We take ‘effort’ to be any incentive-related action that raises scores – for instance, exerting more effort in the
classroom or devoting more time to lesson planning. We will define ability as the component of teacher VA that
does not change over time, conditional on teacher experience.

1

so in terms of their performance benefits and financial costs. This formal policy comparison is
novel, and should help to sharpen policy makers’ assessment of viable education reform options.
Central to addressing the first goal is an estimable framework built around an education
production function, which we use to express teacher VA in terms of teacher ability and effort.
As the form of the production technology is unknown, we assume a linear approximation to
the true function and let inputs have persistent impacts over time – appropriate given that
knowledge accumulates in an education context. From this specification of the technology, we
derive estimating equations that guide our empirical approach.
To bring the framework to the data, we take advantage of a rich administrative data set
covering all North Carolina public school teachers and students over time, and exogenous incentive variation arising from the introduction of the federal “No Child Left Behind” (NCLB)
accountability system. As is well-appreciated in the literature – see Reback (2008) and Neal and
Schanzenbach (2010), for instance – proficiency schemes such as NCLB make students matter
differentially depending on how marginal they are. In line with this idea, we show as motivation
for the main analysis that teacher VA increases in an intuitive measure of incentive strength, a
finding robust to using across- and within-teacher variation, with the evidence also pointing to
a teacher effort response to the reform’s introduction.5
Our proposed estimation procedure leverages this accountability policy variation. Specifically, we assume that educators respond to incentives under proficiency systems by directing
relatively more effort to students predicted to score near the proficiency threshold (as the evidence in our application indicates) and in a similar way across years. We estimate the contemporaneous ability of teachers observed before and after the reform using standard VA estimation
methods and pre-reform data. We then identify contemporaneous effort from the correlation of
post-reform VA with incentive strength (as captured by the proportion of marginal students in
the classroom), conditioning on the estimated pre-reform ability measure and experience. The
estimates indicate that a one standard deviation increase in ability raises scores by 0.18 SD,
compared to 0.05 SD for a one standard deviation increase in effort.
Next, we investigate the extent to which these contemporaneous teacher ability and effort
measures persist in determining an individual student’s test scores in future. To estimate the
persistence of teacher ability, we use data from the pre-reform period and adapt a well-established

The reform did not cause school principals to engage in within-school teacher reassignments nor to alter class
sizes – leading alternative explanations.

method from the previous literature, finding that approximately 40 percent of the initial impact
of teacher ability persists after one year, and 20 percent after four years.
To identify the persistence of effort, the ideal experiment would involve a single one-time
incentive reform that resulted in an immediate effort response, with no correlated responses in
future, allowing us to use a strategy similar to the approach for estimating ability persistence.
As there are several departures from that ideal in our observational setting,6 we develop a
maximum likelihood estimation procedure based on the technology that allows us to account for
three distinct sources of teacher effort explicitly, including the persistent effects of effort from
the previous year (see Section V for a detailed description). The resulting estimates indicate
that 10 percent of the initial effort effect persists one year ahead, which amounts to 25 percent of
the one-year persistence of teacher ability. The faster decay we find for effort relative to ability
is in line with teachers ‘teaching to the test’ to some degree – a phenomenon rarely identified
empirically. Further, we show that not accounting for the test score effects of contemporaneous
effort decisions would result in a significant overestimate of effort persistence.
The combined estimation approach for recovering teacher ability, effort, and their persistent
effects – the first main contribution of our study – is applicable in other contexts where rich
administrative data and clear policy variation are available. Of note, the new estimates we
obtain show that teacher effort is both a productive input and one that responds systematically
to incentive variation, with longer-term benefits for students: in essence, teacher actions matter
alongside teacher type. Our analysis thus underscores the agency of the teaching force as an
important feature of the education production process and one that can be influenced by the
incentive environment, itself partly under the control of the policy maker.
As our second main contribution, we explore the quantitative implications of this economic
agency for the education policy debate. Our estimates suggest a natural question: For resourceconstrained decision makers, are policies that alter the mix of teachers based on value-added
preferable to policies that take the existing teacher stock as given and alter effort incentives
instead? In particular, how would the widely discussed policy of replacing the bottom five
percent of the teacher value-added distribution compare with a policy that targeted teacher
effort incentives? Our framework and estimates allow us to provide the first quantitative evidence
6

These include the correlation of NCLB effort incentives over time, the dependence of contemporaneous effort
on the persistence parameter we wish to estimate, and induced changes to a concurrent state-level accountability
program – the ABCs of Public Education – following the introduction of NCLB.

3

addressing this relevant question.
For the costs and benefits of the ability-based policy, we appeal to prior research – see
Hanushek (2009, 2011), Chetty et al. (2014b) and Rothstein (2015) – for plausible estimates of
the likely impacts in our setting. The literature suggests that a policy removing the bottom
five percent of the teacher VA distribution would cost around $700 per teacher, not least by
increasing employment risk. At the same time, the policy would be likely to increase long
run test scores by 0.0034 SD (averaging across all teachers), drawing on our estimates of the
persistence of ability.
The viable incentive policy we consider is based on the state’s pre-existing ABCs accountability system. This provides incentives to improve student performance throughout the distribution, setting individualized targets for all students according to their prior performance and
thus making all students marginal. To calculate the benefits and costs of a directly comparable incentive policy, we need to recover the underlying mapping between output and incentive
expenditures. Here, we use the introduction of NCLB and the exogenous variation it produced
in both (i) the incentive cost of increased effort7 and (ii) the response of output to effort (due
to the heightened incentives induced under the new ABCs targets the following year). We show
how to combine the two to recover the desired output-expenditure mapping (see Section VI).
This in hand, we can adjust the rewards under the incentive scheme to equate costs with the
ability reform, and then compare the resulting output.
We find that the incentive reform produces 88 percent higher output for the same cost as
the ability-based reform, using our preferred estimates. Further, we show that the advantage
enjoyed by the incentive reform is likely to arise in a range of plausible circumstances – a robust
advantage stemming from the fact that incentives can be applied throughout the teacher VA
distribution whereas ability-based reforms focus on part of the distribution. Not only does the
policy analysis indicate that incentive reforms are competitive with policies targeting teacher
ability. It shows, more generally, how incentive reforms can be compared with alternatives in a
systematic way that draws on underlying technology estimates, providing policy makers with a
new means to choose among the menu of viable education policy options.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II sets out the education produc7

The effort response to NCLB, which we have documented, raised the targets that schools faced in the following
year, given the way ABCs targets are set. More demanding targets in turn lowered the probability of achieving
the ABCs bonus. We can monetize the cost of extra effort from this change in probability.

tion technology central to the analysis. Section III describes the accountability programs and
the North Carolina administrative data we use for estimation, along with motivating descriptive
evidence. In Section IV, we present our strategy for recovering ability and effort contemporaneously, followed by the results from that exercise, and in Section V, we describe our approach for
estimating the persistent effects of ability and effort along with the associated findings. Section
VI presents the cost-effectiveness analysis, and Section VII concludes.

II

Framework

This section sets out the conceptual framework at the heart of our study. We use it to state the
specific goals of our econometric analysis and to derive the equations that guide the estimation
approach we develop.
The framework is based on an education production technology that relates inputs to measured education output y. Estimating the parameters of this technology presents important
challenges, given its underlying specification is unknown and many inputs are unobserved, even
in the most comprehensive administrative datasets. Our approach to these empirical challenges
is to impose some minimal structure (which we do in this section), then leverage plausible sources
of policy variation and rich longitudinal data, described in Section III, to identify key inputs.
We make two main assumptions about the technology’s form:
Assumption 1: The education production technology is linear in its inputs, with an additive
error.
This serves as an approximation to the true underlying function.
Assumption 2: Inputs have a cumulative effect on output.
This second assumption is natural in the case of education, where education investments serve
to increase the stock of knowledge over time. We will treat time discretely, corresponding to
our yearly data. Specifically, the current academic year is denoted by t, and a student’s grade is
indexed by g ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}, where the first year of formal schooling, kindergarten, is represented
by g = 0.
We focus on two inputs, teacher ability and teacher effort, and their contemporaneous
and persistent effects in terms of measured output given by test scores. Reflecting the two

5

assumptions above, the following representation of the technology makes explicit (suppressing
other inputs for clarity) how each of the two inputs affects student learning, both in the current
year t and in all prior academic years:
yijgst =

X


γτa aj(i,t−τ ) + γτe ej(i,t−τ ) + νijgst .

(1)

0≤τ ≤g

Equation (1) describes the test score of student i, who is assigned (exogenously) to teacher j in
grade g at school s in year t.8 That score is allowed to be a function of the full history of relevant
school inputs, extending back to the first year the student was in school (in period t−g), where τ
is a ‘lag’ index that takes on integer values from 0 up to g. Input aj(i,t−τ ) is the ability of student
i’s teacher in year t − τ , ej(i,t−τ ) is the effort of the teacher in that year given the prevailing
incentives, and is allowed to be student-specific (as with NCLB), and νijgst is an additive error
term. While teacher ability and teacher effort are measured in the same (developmental scale)
units, the parameterization of the input productivities in (1) allows teacher ability to have a
different impact on scores than teacher effort – something we test. We also impose the following
Normalization: The contemporaneous effects of a one-unit change in teacher ability and a
one-unit change in teacher effort are normalized to be equal, with γ0a = γ0e = 1.
We make this normalization because the unobserved contemporaneous inputs and parameters
cannot be separately identified, although potential differences in the persistent effects of ability
and effort are still allowed – that is, γτa 6= γτe for τ > 0.
In an ideal setting where equation (1) could be estimated directly, it would be possible
to identify teacher ability and effort, aj(i,t−τ ) and ej(i,t−τ ) , separately for each teacher j, both
in the current year and in prior years, and also estimate the persistent effects of past ability
and effort on test scores, captured by the full set of parameters {γτa , γτe }τ >0 . In practice, two
main data limitations need confronting, reflected in our subsequent empirical analysis: First,
it is almost never possible to observe the full sequence of the relevant ability and effort inputs
that students have received since the start of their formal schooling. As a consequence, our
approach will be to summarize inputs from the more distant past using the lagged test score of a
given student, an approach used widely in the literature – see Rivkin et al. (2005), for example.
8

We take teacher and student assignments to classrooms as given here, noting that the empirics below will
address non-random sorting.

6

Second, and related, identifying the full sequence of persistence parameters is not feasible, so
we will concentrate on identifying a subset.
Our proposed estimation strategies will be built around a re-writing of the test score technology in terms of once-lagged test scores. After some straightforward algebra,9 the resulting
expression for current test scores is then
yijgst = γyi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t−1 + aj(i,t) + ej(i,t) + ijgst .

(3)

where the error term ijgst contains the entire history of past inputs as well as the two most
recent random shocks to performance.10
The first empirical goal of the paper is to separate out the contemporaneous teacher ability
and effort inputs. Equation (3) will guide our approach (presented in Section IV) for estimating
contemporaneous ability and effort at the teacher level, using estimates of teacher VA as a
starting point. Appealing to the additive structure, teacher VA in a given year is captured by a
teacher-year fixed effect qjt , written qjt = aj + ējt + ¯jt , consisting of incentive-invariant teacher
ability (aj ), incentive-varying teacher effort averaged across students in the class (ējt ), and a
common classroom shock that includes mean test score noise (¯
jt ).
Our second estimation goal, having recovered contemporaneous teacher ability and effort,
relates to the persistence of the two input sequences. To isolate the persistence parameters that
9
First, multiply the prior score by γ, which represents the rate at which the stock of knowledge accumulated
up to period t − 1 persists to affect current test scores (see Todd and Wolpin 2003) – a composite measure of
the persistent effects of teacher ability, teacher effort, and random shocks to performance. Second, subtract the
result from both sides of the test score equation, allowing the teacher j 0 and school s0 in the previous year to be
different and imposing the above normalization. Doing so yields

The second goal with reference to equation (4) is then to identify the persistent effects of teacher
ability and effort one year ahead, given by γ1a and γ1e . This specification will serve as the basis
for the estimation approach we implement in Section V.

III

Institutional Background and Data

Our broad estimation approach requires exogenous incentive variation and rich data on individual students and teachers. Given those needs, we focus on North Carolina, a state that offers
useful variation in performance incentives across teachers and schools, as well as administrative
data covering all public schools and their teachers and students, followed over time.
III.A

Accountability Incentives

Incentive variation in the state arises from two separate accountability regimes. NCLB was
implemented in North Carolina for the 2002-03 school year following the passage of the federal No
Child Left Behind Act in 2001. NCLB emphasized student proficiency, establishing performance
targets based on end-of-grade mathematics and reading tests. When a smaller-than-required
fraction of students reached proficiency status on those tests, schools failed to satisfy NCLB
requirements and were subject to sanctions that became more severe over time in the event of
repeated failure. As is well appreciated – see Reback (2008), for example – such proficiency-count
systems create incentives for teachers to direct relatively more effort toward students likely to
score close to the test score proficiency target.
NCLB was introduced on top of a pre-existing state-level accountability program, the ABCs
of Public Education, implemented in North Carolina in the 1996-97 school year for all schools
serving students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Under the ABCs, each school was assigned an average growth target, depending on prior student performance and a constant level of
11

Specifically, bring the once-lagged ability and effort terms – that is, (γ1a − γγ0a )aj(i,t−1) + (γ1e − γγ0e )ej(i,t−1)
– out of the error term ijgst , denote the new error term ηijgst , and use the normalization γ0a = γ0e = 1.

8

expected growth. If average student test scores at the school exceeded the target, the ABCs paid
a monetary bonus to all teachers and the principal – a feature we use in the cost-effectiveness
analysis below.12
It is worth emphasizing the marked shift in incentives facing schools and teachers in North
Carolina that followed the introduction of NCLB in the 2002-03 academic year. The ABCs’
emphasis on average performance meant that teachers were not previously incentivized to direct
effort across individual students in a differential way. Yet because of NCLB’s sole focus on
proficiency, it is reasonable to expect that students likely to score near the test score proficiency
threshold in 2002-03 would realize greater test score gains than in past years, given the new
incentives. We provide evidence of this pattern below, and use it to motivate our strategy for
separately identifying teacher effort and ability.13
At the same time, in terms of possible confounding changes, the introduction of NCLB
was not associated with the creation of new end-of-grade tests or student proficiency thresholds
based on those tests – we discuss this in more detail in Section IV. Rather, the state already
had evaluations and performance metrics in place as part of the ABCs.
III.B

Data and Descriptive Statistics

The rich longitudinal data used in our analysis cover the entire state, available through the North
Carolina Education Research Data Center (NCERDC). These data contain yearly standardized
test scores for all third through eighth grade public school students, encrypted identifiers for
students and teachers, and unencrypted school identifiers. Thus students can be tracked over
time, and linked to a teacher and school in any given year.
We provide an overview of the data here, with more information in Appendix B. The main
sample runs from the 1996-97 to the 2004-05 academic year and covers over 2.5 million studentyear observations. Table 1 presents summary statistics. In terms of performance measures, we
focus on end-of-grade test scores for students in third through fifth grade: the teacher recorded as
the test proctor in these grades is typically the teacher who taught the students throughout the
year. The scores are measured on a developmental scale, designed so that each additional point
represents the same amount of knowledge gained, irrespective of the baseline score and school
12

See Macartney (2016) for additional detail about the ABCs program.
Given the complexity of the NCLB legislation, other plausible sources of variation are available to researchers –
for instance, relating to subgroups. We focus on student-level variation associated with a straightforward measure
of incentive strength (introduced in Section III.C), showing this to be first-order.
13

9

grade (see Appendix B for further discussion). Both the mathematics and reading scores in the
table show a monotonic increase across grades, consistent with knowledge being accumulated in
those subjects over time.
We work directly with test scores measured on the state-provided developmental scale rather
than standardizing test scores at the grade-year level (as in much of the literature) because of
our focus on the incentive effects associated with NCLB. This dictates that we preserve as much
of incentive-related variation in the data as possible – in particular, the aggregate effects of
NCLB incentives in the 2002-03 academic year,14 and also consider the same test score metric
teachers are likely using to make effort decisions.15 As with many education studies that use
test scores, our analysis will draw on the careful psychometric design of such tests (in North
Carolina and elsewhere).16 In this regard, compelling prior papers have already demonstrated
the strong ‘signal’ value contained in test scores, apparent in terms of their correlation with
important long-run outcomes (see, for example, CFR 2014b).
The longitudinal nature of the data set enables us to construct growth score measures for
both mathematics and reading, based on within-student gains. Student gain scores are (as noted
above) the focus of the ABCs program. As the table shows, mathematics and reading growth is
positive on average across grades, with the largest gains in both subjects occurring in the earlier
grades.17
The data set also includes demographic characteristics shown in the table that serve as useful
control variables. In the aggregate, about 40 percent of students are minorities (non-white), 6
percent are learning-disabled, only 3 percent are limited English-proficient, and 44 percent are
eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Around 25 percent of students have college-educated
parents, and very small fractions of students repeat a grade.
14
De-meaning test scores is typically carried out precisely in order to remove the effects of year-specific influences
on performance.
15
North Carolina embedded test score proficiency cutoffs into the developmental scale directly, which makes
it natural to assume that schools and teachers used the same scale when forecasting which students were likely
to score near the test score proficiency threshold. This consideration will become especially important when we
present our strategy for estimating the persistence of teacher effort in Section V.
16
We note that studies that standardize test scores rely – at least implicitly – on the integrity of the underlying
developmental scales used to measure student performance, given they are order-preserving linear transformations
of developmental scale test scores that are not invariant to the original scale.
17
The table also reports ‘future’ mathematics and reading scores – the scores we observe for our sample of third
through fifth grade students when they are in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, which are used when measuring
the persistent effects of teacher ability and effort below.

10

III.C

Descriptive Evidence

We now motivate the subsequent empirical analysis with correlations that suggest teacher valueadded is responsive to incentives.
Proficiency-count systems like NCLB (as noted) provide educators with strong incentives
to focus on students at the margin of passing relative to the scheme’s fixed proficiency target.
Building on that notion, we show that teacher-year fixed effects,18 which are commonly used
to measure teacher effectiveness, covary with a simple proxy for NCLB incentive strength in
2002-03. Teacher-year VA should be an increasing function of classroom average student NCLB
incentive strength, since teacher-year VA represents average residual student test score gains
within a classroom. Thus we define a student as ‘marginal’ if she is predicted to score within
four developmental scale points on either side of the proficiency cutoff, and calculate the fraction
of students in each classroom who are marginal in that sense – the results are robust to various
alternative choices (see Section IV).
Figure 1 shows that teacher-year fixed effects are positively correlated with the proportion
of marginal students within a classroom. The relationships in Figure 1 are significant (at the
one percent level) and positive in each grade in 2002-03, with a one standard deviation increase
in the classroom proportion of marginal students being associated with 7, 17, and 11 percent
standard deviation increases in teacher-year VA in third, fourth, and fifth grade, respectively.
These raw data patterns suggest that NCLB may have caused teachers to exert more effort due
to the prevailing incentives. In contrast, we would expect there to be no relationship between
the proportion of marginal students in a classroom and teacher VA in the pre-NCLB period: we
will document such a pattern in the next section.19

IV

Separating Contemporaneous Ability and Effort

Building on the descriptive evidence, we now set out our estimation approach for separating a
teacher’s contribution to student test scores (measured by VA) into current ability and effort,
before presenting the estimates.
18

Appendix C describes how teacher-year fixed effects are estimated, following standard methods.
There, we also argue that more than simple correlational plots are required to account for a confounding
negative correlation between marginal student presence and teacher ability that arises from the sorting of students
to teachers based on ability. The estimates we present in the next section will account for sorting.
19

IV.A

Estimation Approach

Our estimation approach consists of three steps.
Step 1 - Estimating Teacher-Year Fixed Effects: We use standard methods to compute teacher-year fixed effects based on student mathematics scores for each ‘teacher j and
academic year t’ combination.20 We start by aggregating the individual production technology
given by equation (3) up to the teacher level. In line with our framework, this allows us to
write the estimated teacher fixed effect (q̂jt ) as the sum of incentive-invariant teacher ability
(aj ), incentive-varying teacher effort averaged across students in the class (ējt ), and a common
classroom shock that includes mean test score noise (¯
jt ):
q̂jt = aj + 1(t ≥ 2002-03)ējt + ¯jt .

(5)

We will identify the ability and effort components in equation (5) separately in the next two
steps.
Teacher ‘ability’ in this analysis should be thought of as capturing both (true) ability and
average ABCs-related effort exerted by the teacher across all of her years of teaching under
the ABCs program, given that it operated in North Carolina prior to NCLB (see Appendix
C.III for further discussion): the two cannot be separately identified. Understanding ‘ability’ in
this sense, the equation makes the timing of the effort impact of NCLB explicit: the indicator
variable multiplying average effort turns on when the academic year is 2002-03 or later.
Step 2 - Estimating Incentive-Invariant Ability:

Next, we identify teacher ability during

a period when NCLB did not operate, based on pre-reform data; this ensures that our estimates
of teacher ability are independent of performance variation due to NCLB incentives. We use the
Empirical Bayes (EB) estimator of teacher VA (see Kane and Staiger 2008, and Chetty, Friedman
and Rockoff 2011), assuming incentive-invariant ability is fixed over time, conditional on teacher
experience.21 Specifically, we run the following pooled regression across all grades and years
20

The approach as well as the students and teachers in the VA estimation sample are described in Appendix C.
We opt not to use an estimator that allows teacher ability to drift over time (see CFR (2014a), Rothstein
(2014) and Bacher-Hicks et al. (2014)), given that predicting teacher ability in 2002-03 with the drift estimator
requires performance data from that year when constructing optimal weights, and could confound teacher ability
estimates with incentive variation in that year. Also, the main advantage of the drift estimator is that it assigns
greater weight to more recent years in order to better predict teacher performance in a given year. While CFR
21

12

from 1996-97 to 2001-02, in which test scores are regressed on grade-specific cubic polynomials
of prior scores, written fg (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t ), indicators for student ethnicity, gender, limited-English
proficiency, disability status, parental education, grade repetition, grade and year fixed effects,
and controls for teacher experience:22
yijgst = fg (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t ) + x0ijgst β + h(expjt ) + aj + θjt + ijgst ,

(6)

where aj represents teacher ability. The EB estimator uses several years of data for each teacher
to construct an optimally-weighted average of classroom-level residual test scores in order to
separate teacher ability, aj , from classroom-specific shocks, θjt , and student-level noise, ijgst .23
Step 3 - Estimating NCLB-Induced Effort Response: In the third step, we estimate
NCLB-induced teacher effort using the estimated teacher fixed effects from 2002-03 from Step
1, along with estimates of teacher ability from Step 2 and the fraction of students in a teacher’s
classroom deemed ‘marginal’ with respect to the NCLB target.24
We define a student as ‘marginal’ if she was predicted to score within four developmental
scale points of the test score proficiency cutoff on either side (as in the descriptive analysis in
Section III.C). For each classroom, the incentive strength measure, mjt , is defined as the fraction
of students in the classroom who are marginal in this sense. We then identify the component
of teacher-year quality that is attributable to NCLB effort incentives by regressing teacher-year
fixed effects q̂jt on mjt , while controlling for incentive-invariant teacher ability (âj ) and teacher
experience (expjt ):
q̂jt = ψmjt + λâj + w(expjt ) + ξjt .

(7)

The error term ξjt captures potentially confounding classroom shocks.
(2014a) show this improves teacher VA prediction in their large urban school district, the correlation in North
Carolina between teacher effect measures over time is higher than in the CFR data (see Rothstein 2014), implying
a smaller benefit to using the drift estimator in our setting.
22
The experience function h(·) is parameterized by including indicators for each level of experience from zero to
five years, the omitted category being teachers with six or more years of experience; we choose this specification
to be consistent with CFR (2014a).
23
While the EB estimator is our preferred method for measuring teacher ability, our estimates of the effects
of NCLB incentives on teacher-year VA are robust to accounting for teacher incentive-invariant ability in a nonparametric way using either first-difference or teacher fixed-effects models (see Appendix D).
24
This draws on the intuitive notion (already rehearsed) that teachers have the strongest incentives to direct
additional effort to students predicted to score close to the proficiency threshold.

13

Once NCLB is introduced, teachers are hypothesized to exert additional effort according
to the amount of incentive pressure they face. We thus test whether there is a systematic
relationship between q̂jt and mjt in 2002-03 but no relationship prior. Given the linearity assumption, we use equation (7) to predict the portion of teacher performance given by effort,
writing e(mj,02−03 ) ≡ ψ̂mj,02−03 .25 This predicted value represents the response to the new incentive scheme, capturing the relationship between teacher-year performance and the classroom
fraction of marginal students in 2002-03 conditional on ability and experience.
The key assumption underpinning our strategy for identifying teacher effort responses to
NCLB incentives is that, conditional on teacher ability and experience, no other factors influencing teacher-year VA are correlated with mjt in 2002-03 – an assumption whose validity we
assess below – see Section IV.B.1.
IV.B

Estimates of Ability and Effort

We now present the estimates from applying the approach.
Ability:

In terms of our estimates of contemporaneous teacher ability, Table 2 reports sum-

mary statistics, including estimated standard deviations of 2.16, 1.63 and 1.63 developmental
scale points across third, fourth, and fifth grade, respectively – see columns (1)-(3). Averaged
across grades, the standard deviation is 1.79 scale points, or equivalently 0.18 student-level standard deviations. Figure 2 presents the incentive-invariant teacher ability distributions, where
incentive-invariant ability is defined as the EB estimate from equation (6). The figure shows
that there is significant variation in ability across teachers, all centered roughly around zero
(due to a normalization in the EB procedure).
Effort:

For effort, we start by presenting the estimated relationships between teacher value-

added and incentives. The panels of Figure 3 show the grade-specific partial relationships
between the teacher-year fixed effects q̂jt and incentive strength mjt , where the latter is residualized with respect to teacher ability and experience. For each grade, we present plots for
2002-03, indicating a clear increasing relationship between the part of the teacher-year effect
25

By omitting an intercept, this parameterization assumes that NCLB-related teacher effort is zero when a
teacher has no marginal students in her classroom. This is supported by the motivating visual evidence – see the
binned scatter plots of Figure 1 and in Figures 3 and D.2 below. Our main results below focus on the variance of
predicted effort and marginal changes in effort, both of which are determined solely by the slope parameter, ψ̂.

14

unexplained by ability and experience and the proportion of marginal students in the classroom.
Alongside, we plot the corresponding pooled relationship for all pre-NCLB years that also includes year fixed effects. The pre-NCLB variation plots show no discernible link between teacher
performance and our measure of NCLB incentives, results that are robust to alternative cutoff
points for defining a student as marginal under NCLB (see Appendix D).
Table 3 shows regression estimates indicating how teacher-year effects change with an increase in the fraction of marginal students in the classroom (the underlying estimates of ψ from
equation (7)). They imply that, conditional on teacher ability and experience, a one standard
deviation increase in the proportion of marginal students is associated with 9 percent, 22 percent,
and 16 percent standard deviation increases in teacher-year VA in third, fourth, and fifth grades,
respectively. As expected, conditioning on teacher ability and experience, there is virtually no
relationship between teacher-year effects and the classroom proportion of marginal students in
the pre-NCLB years.26
The panels of Figure 4 present the full distributions of predicted effort in each grade in
2002-03, where effort is constructed as the fitted value e(mj02−03 ) = ψ̂mj02−03 : columns (7) to
(9) of Table 2 present the corresponding estimates for each grade. Mean teacher effort averaged
across all grades is 0.61 points. Although the dispersion in teacher effort is not as high as the
dispersion in teacher ability, we find quantitatively significant variation in effort across teachers:
the variance of effort across all grades is 0.48 scale points, which equates to 0.05 student-level
standard deviations of the test score.
IV.B.1

Robustness Checks: Assessing Rival Hypotheses

The evidence just presented is consistent with teachers increasing effort in response to the
incentives introduced under NCLB. Given that we do not observe effort directly, it is important to
consider alternative potential explanations. We consider several hypotheses that are alternatives
to teacher effort setting, summarizing our findings here – see Appendix D for the results in full.
First, our results are not explained by other institutional changes coinciding with NCLB’s
introduction. The state did not change either its curriculum or the content appearing on the end26
Here, one may worry about a mechanical correlation between teacher-year fixed effects and teacher ability, as
the latter is estimated using pre-NCLB variation – the same variation as used to estimate pre-reform fixed effects.
We address this problem by using jack-knife EB estimates of teacher ability in the pre-NCLB period, which use
information from all other years excepting the one in question (Chetty, Friedman and Rockoff 2011).

15

of-grade tests we use as our dependent variable,27 nor did NCLB’s introduction in North Carolina
provide any new information to families about student performance, thus making parental or
student effort responses unlikely. Second, we rule out several other school-level adjustments to
NCLB as drivers of our results, showing that marginal students were not sorted differentially
to classrooms based on teacher ability. Further, accounting for changes in class size and several
other classroom-level student characteristics does not affect our main estimates.

V

Estimating the Persistence of Teacher Ability and Effort

Having identified teacher ability and effort separately, we now assess whether these two inputs
persist at different rates. The issue is key to understanding whether the separate effort effect
we have identified is likely to be consequential for economic outcomes in the longer run, and
also important for the policy analysis that follows. Unlike the previous section, the analysis is
conducted at the student (rather than the teacher) level, thereby exploiting more variation in
the data and following prior work that estimates the persistence of teacher effects as a whole.
V.A

Estimating the Persistence of Ability

We estimate the persistence of ability in a reduced-form way, following the previous literature –
see CFR 2014b, for example. Specifically, we regress student test scores in academic year t + n
(where the time index n ranges from −2 to 4) on the full control vector from the Empirical
Bayes regression (equation (6)) and the ability of teacher j who taught the student in period t:
yi,j,g,s,t+n = fg (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t ) + x0ijgst β + h(expjt ) + φn aˆj + ijgst .

(8)

Here, ability is measured with a jack-knife EB estimator, which uses information from all years
except the current year to form the teacher ability estimate.28 The coefficient φn represents
the degree to which the effect of teacher ability from year t influences test scores in year t + n.
Looking one period ahead, φ1 is our empirical estimate of the persistence rate of teacher ability
that is given by γ1a in equation (4), while setting n = 4 lets us investigate the persistent effect
27

The mathematics test was last changed in 2000-01.
Doing so avoids a mechanical correlation between measurement error in test scores and teacher ability from
confounding the results (see CFR 2014b for further discussion).
28

16

of teacher ability on test scores four periods ahead.29
Figure 5 presents the estimated φn coefficients from regressions based on test scores exclusively from the pre-NCLB period. It shows that teachers do not affect their students’ test scores
in the years before they are matched with these students, as shown by the estimate at t − 2.
(Since we control for once-lagged test scores when estimating teacher ability, the coefficient at
t − 1 is identically zero.) The estimates indicate that a one developmental scale point betterthan-average teacher in year t improves student test scores by almost exactly one developmental
scale point, on average.30 The contemporaneous effect of teacher ability then fades away over
time, as we estimate that 41 percent of the initial effect persists in period t + 1, and only 20
percent remains by period t + 4. (For reference, in their analysis of the persistence of teacher
value-added, CFR (2014b) find that approximately half of the initial effect persists one period
ahead and 20 percent remains four periods ahead.)
V.B

Estimating the Persistence of Effort

Identifying effort persistence requires that we account for three confounding effort effects. First,
incentives to exert effort under NCLB are strongly correlated over time – that is, students who
are marginal in one year tend to be marginal the next and so would be expected to receive higher
effort in both years as a result; thus it is important to control for the effects of contemporaneous
effort on scores to avoid overstating the persistence of lagged effort. Second, contemporaneous
effort will depend on the persistence parameter we wish to estimate, given that educators make
effort decisions based on expected student performance, and predicted scores will be determined
in part by any effort persistence from the previous year; a strategy for disentangling the two
is therefore needed. Third, the introduction of NCLB induced changes in incentives under the
pre-existing ABCs program.31 The resulting effort responses need to be controlled for to avoid
confounding student-level effort persistence with school-level ABCs-related improvements.
The approach we devise involves estimating effort at the student level, focusing on effort
29
Our structural parameter of interest, γ1a , reflects the direct effect of the prior-year teacher on current-year
test scores. In contrast, the reduced-form estimate φ1 represents the total effect of the prior-year teacher, which
includes the direct effect and any potential effects that come from being tracked to better teachers in future years
as a result of having a better teacher in the prior year. CFR (2014b) propose a strategy for estimating the direct
(or net) effect of the prior-year teacher on students’ adult earnings and show there are only modest differences
between the net and reduced-form effects.
30
The point estimate is 0.998 with a 95-percent confidence interval of (0.983, 1.015).
31
Specifically, given the value-added nature of the ABCs system, higher performance in one year engenders
higher targets the next, which will lead to stronger incentives to exert higher effort as a result.

persistence one year ahead, and using the production technology in a maximum likelihood procedure to account for the three effects just described. We now set out these elements (see Appendix
E for a detailed description) before presenting the estimates.
V.B.1

Estimating Student-Level Effort

Under the proficiency-count design of NCLB, effort incentives can vary across students within
a given classroom, with some students being more marginal than others: such within-classroom
variation is entirely first order in our setting.32 Thus we start by constructing a student-level
measure of effort, rather than one that is common to all students taught by a given teacher.
Our effort measure is derived from the non-parametric patterns in Figure 6. This figure
shows that the introduction of NCLB had pronounced non-linear effects on test scores, consistent
with strong teacher effort responses to the scheme. Two notions are relevant for understanding
the figure. First, we construct the predicted student score in 2002-03 in a way that excludes
the NCLB-induced effort response,33 as if NCLB had never been implemented in that year.
The resulting difference between the realized and predicted scores for a given student then
provides a (noisy) measure of the 2002-03 effort response by her teacher (where effort is taken
to be the incentive-related boost to scores), used to construct the points on the vertical axis
described below. Second, the incentive strength for each student is given by the distance between
the predicted score and the fixed NCLB proficiency target. This incentive measure is used to
form the horizontal axis in Figure 6, which groups students into two-scale-point width bins
of incentive strength in 2002-03 (denoted πi,02−03 for student i). We then plot the average
difference between the realized and predicted score within each incentive strength bin on the
vertical axis, eliminating idiosyncratic test score noise to recover average teacher effort as a
function of incentive strength.
The pattern for 2002-03 shows that students who are predicted to score near the proficiency
threshold – those for whom effort incentives are strongest – receive the largest boost to their
scores. We conduct the same exercise for the 1999-2000 pre-reform period (when no NCLB effort
response can occur) to ensure that we do not systematically under- or over-predict test scores
at different parts of the distribution. Doing so makes clear that our predicted score tracks the

In 2002-03, for example, fully 75 percent of the variance in the incentive strength measure we devise (see
below) occurred within-classroom.

18

realized score well throughout, given by the approximately flat line. In turn, this lends credence
to the view that the 2002-03 pattern reflects student-specific NCLB effort.
The profiles for the two years in Figure 6 are then used to estimate an effort function that
takes incentive strength as its argument. Specifically, we difference the binned 2002-03 and
1999-00 profiles, then fit an eighth-order polynomial to the differenced data using a weighted
regression, with the weights capturing the total number of students in each bin (across both
2002-03 and 1999-00) – see Appendix E.III. The resulting effort function, denoted by eN (·), is
plotted in Figure 7.
We use this function to assign effort levels to individual students directly. Taking the
student-specific values of πi,02−03 and the function eN (·), the effort dedicated to each student i
by teacher j in 2002-03 is given by ej(i,02−03) = eN (πi,02−03 ), reading off the appropriate effort
level from the function.34 (As explained below, we also use the function to assign a level of effort
to each student in 2003-04, subject to further scaling.)
V.B.2

The Estimating Equation

Next, we specify an equation that can be taken to the data in order to estimate the rate at which
effort persists along with other policy-relevant parameters. Here, we draw on the technology in
equation (4) to obtain an expression for test scores in 2003-04 as a function of inputs in that
year and inputs from the previous year whose effects persist:
yi,j,g,s,03−04 = γ(yi,j 0 ,g−1,s,02−03 − aj(i,02−03) − ej(i,02−03) )
+ γ1a aj(i,02−03) + aj(i,03−04)
+ γ1e ej(i,02−03) + ej(i,03−04) + ηi,j,g,s,03−04 .

(9)

The RHS of this equation captures, on the first line, the persistent effect of once-lagged scores
from 2002-03 excluding teacher ability or effort, written yi,j 0 ,g−1,02−03 − aj(i,02−03) − ej(i,02−03) ,
where the j-subscripts coincide – that is, j 0 = j(i, 02 − 03). Given the technology, we interpret
this component as the persistent effect of non-ability and non-effort inputs. The second line
captures the persistent effects of teacher ability from 2002-03 and teacher ability in the current
34

Note that the values of the effort function are negative for the left and right extremes of incentive strength.
This should be interpreted as follows: the effort function reflects student test score gains relative to the pre-NCLB
status quo; thus, the extremes of incentive strength are not associated with negative levels of absolute effort but
with lower test score gains than in the pre-NCLB period for a subset of non-marginal students.

19

year 2003-04; and the third line includes the persistent effects of teacher effort from 2002-03 and
in the current year 2003-04, along with a random shock to current test scores.
To derive the main estimating equation, we wish to isolate the effort components in 2003C
04 that are relevant from an estimation perspective. Collect terms by defining yi,j,g,s,03−04
≡

γ(yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,02−03 − aj(i,02−03) − ej(i,02−03) ) + aj(i,03−04) + γ1a aj(i,02−03) , and deduct this from both
sides of (4), removing all non-effort inputs from the RHS. This yields our estimating equation,
written:
C
yi,j,g,s,03−04 − yi,j,g,s,03−04
= γ1e eN (πi,02−03 ) + θeN (πi,03−04 ) + ρēN
s,02−03 +νi,j,g,s,03−04 .

(10)

ei,j,g,s,03−04

We discuss each of the three effort components on the RHS in turn, explaining where the
corresponding effort incentives come from and the specific timing of each effect.35
The first term captures the effect of effort in the previous year, 2002-03, due to the introduction of NCLB incentives. We assume this effort component is known, determined by incentive
strength (πi,02−03 ) according to the semi-parametric effort function eN (·). The parameter γ1e
measures the rate at which effort in 2002-03 persists one year ahead to affect test scores in
2003-04.
Next, the underbrace on the RHS of (10) serves to emphasize that in our formulation, the
second and third terms are subcomponents of contemporaneous effort, ei,j,g,s,03−04 . Given the
prevailing incentives in 2003-04, we hypothesize that contemporaneous effort comes from two
sources. Taking these in turn, the second term (given by θeN (πi,03−04 )) consists of NCLBinduced effort in 2003-04. While it is unknown to the econometrician, we make the following
‘shape’ assumption:
Assumption 3: The effort devoted to student i in 2003-04 is given by θeN (·) evaluated at
πi,03−04 , where θ > 0.
Thus, teachers use the same empirically-determined effort function eN (·) as in 2002-03 to set
effort, the function taking πi,03−04 as its argument in 2003-04, and the parameter θ either
diminishing (when θ < 1) or amplifying (when θ > 1) all effort levels in a proportional way.
This formulation is reasonable given that the rules of NCLB operated in 2002-03 and 2003-04: it
35

The reasoning is set out in full in Appendix E.III; for reference, a complete listing of all the formal notation
used is given in Appendix Table E.1.

20

is plausible to think that teachers would direct effort to students in a similar fashion across the
two years, with marginal students receiving relatively more effort than non-marginal students
in each year, though possibly to a lesser or greater extent across years (scaled by θ).
The third term accounts for the test score effects of induced changes in effort incentives under
the ABCs in 2003-04 (captured by the parameter ρ). ABCs incentives vary at the school level,
not across students within a given school.36 Because school ABCs targets are functions of student
average prior-year test scores, they also depend on average prior-year effort (see Appendix E.III).
Thus, changes in average school-level effort from 2002-03 lead indirectly to changes in schools’
ABCs effort decisions in 2003-04 through the effect of prior effort on subsequent ABCs targets.
The fourth term on the RHS consists of random factors affecting individual scores in 2003-04.
V.C

Estimation Procedure

Our goal is to recover the parameters of equation (10). These govern effort persistence (γ1e ), the
scale factor multiplying contemporaneous effort (θ), and the indirect effect of ABCs incentives
on student test scores (ρ). One estimation challenge is that the input to the 2003-04 effort
function depends on the (unknown) persistence rate, yet in order to estimate the persistence
rate, we need to account for the correlation of effort across time.
Our strategy involves estimating effort received by students in 2003-04 simultaneously with
the parameters of interest. To that end, we use a maximum likelihood approach, making the
following distributional assumption about the error in equation (10):
Assumption 4 – Normality: ηi,j,g,s,03−04 ∼ N (µ, σ 2 ).
Equation (10) and the normality assumption allow us to derive the individual likelihood for any
student i, given by

Key to our estimation approach is the notion that while student-specific effort values in 200304 are unknown to the econometrician, the function by which they are determined is known
(under Assumption 3, justified above). When searching over values of γ1e to maximize the log
likelihood, we can therefore use standard gradient-based methods by taking the derivative of the
known effort function eN (·) with respect to γ1e .37
V.C.1

Identification

Separately identifying γ1e and θ – the parameters related to NCLB – requires that, conditional
on 2002-03 effort given by eN (πi,02−03 ), there is remaining variation in 2003-04 effort, denoted
eN (πi,03−04 ), and vice-versa. This requirement is met in our application. Start with the nonmonotonic shape of the effort function in 2002-03: this ensures that two students with the
same level of effort in 2002-03 can have different levels of incentive strength under NCLB and,
correspondingly, different levels of 2003-04 NCLB effort. Given the non-monotonicity of the
2002-03 effort function, the minimal condition for identifying the parameters is that the 2003-04
effort function should not be flat.
To see why, suppose that the 2003-04 effort response is determined by some arbitrary nonflat function and consider any two inframarginal students, one with a predicted score below the
proficiency target and one above it, yet who receive the same level of effort in 2002-2003 due
to the non-monotonic profile of the effort function in that year. Incentive strength in 2003-04
37
Specifically, on each iteration of the search, the routine selects a value for γ1e , substitutes that value along
C
with the other known inputs into the known effort function eN (yi,j,g,03−04
+ γ1e ej(i,02−03) − ygT,N ) and generates
an effort level in 2003-04 for each student. The iterative search continues until the routine arrives at a value for
γ1e that, together with the 2003-04 effort levels it implies, maximizes the log likelihood. In practice, we perform
the estimation in MATLAB using the ‘fmincon’ command and supplying the gradient vector.

22

increases equally for each student, given by the common amount of 2002-03 effort that persists.
A non-flat effort function in 2003-04 then guarantees that at least some student pair satisfying
the identical-effort condition in 2002-03 receives divergent levels of effort in 2003-04.38
To identify the separate effects of NCLB and ABCs incentives and thus identify ρ, we draw
on the fact that the ABCs incentives operate across schools while NCLB incentives operate
within schools.39 Separate identification of ρ from both γ1e and θ relies on there being significant
within-school variation in NCLB incentives, a condition satisfied in the data.
V.C.2

Maximum Likelihood Estimates

Having established parameter identification, we apply the maximum likelihood estimation routine to a sample of students observed in both 2002-03 and 2003-04 and for whom test scores
are non-missing in both years. This restriction allows us to compare realized scores with counterfactual predicted scores for each student, needed to form the LHS of the main estimating
equation.
Table 4 presents the results. The first column provides an estimate of the persistence of
NCLB effort from 2002-03 without accounting for contemporaneous NCLB effort in 2003-04. In
this case, 40 percent of the initial effort effect persists one year into the future: as shown in
column (2), this estimate overstates the persistence rate. Once we account for contemporaneous
NCLB effort, the estimate of γ1e falls to 0.10, implying that only 10 percent of the initial effort
carries forward to affect 2003-04 test scores.
The estimate of θ = 0.52 in column (2) indicates that the effort response is scaled down by
around 50 percent in 2003-04 relative to 2002-03. This finding of θ̂ < 1 implies that the difference
between the effort received by marginal and non-marginal students at the average school becomes
smaller in 2003-04 than in 2002-03, suggesting a lower relative boost to marginal student test
scores over time. To rationalize this, it is likely that teachers and school principals realized over
time that the sanctions might not be as binding as first thought.40
38
Indeed, there is zero variation in effort within all such student pairs only if the 2003-04 effort function is flat,
implying that any non-monotonic effort function in 2002-2003 and non-flat function in 2003-04 are sufficient for
identification. (As an aside, although we assume the same functional form for the effort function (up to the scale
θ) in 2003-04 as in 2002-03, this assumption is not required for identification: any effort function in 2003-04 that
is not flat would be sufficient.)

Specifically, the ABCs scheme sets only an average school-level growth target, while NCLB sets a student-level
target (the test score required for subject matter proficiency) in addition to an overall school-level target – the
proficiency rate.

In practice, loopholes such as the Safe Harbor provision meant that sanctions were imposed less frequently

Accounting for ABCs incentives in column (3) yields an estimate of ρ̂ = 0.29, meaning that
a one standard deviation increase in school-level NCLB effort from 2002-03 (ēN
s,02−03 ) produces
a 0.8 percent of a standard deviation increase in student-level test scores the following year.41
While this is a relatively small effect, the positive and significant estimate of ρ is consistent with
the effort response to NCLB in 2002-03 strengthening ABCs incentives in the following year by
making the targets more difficult to pass, which in turn led to student performance gains. The
estimates of γ1e and θ are nearly identical to those obtained from the maximum likelihood routine
that does not account for ABCs incentives, consistent with NCLB incentives varying within
schools while ABCs incentives vary across schools (as the respective accountability incentives
imply).42
In sum, our combined estimation approach has allowed us to recover the separate effects
(current and persisting) of two unobserved teacher inputs – ability and effort – for the first time
in the literature. The estimates for effort draw attention to the role of the economic agency of
teachers. They make clear that teacher effort can be shifted, based on accountability incentive
variation, and that the resulting effort brings performance benefits in the short and longer term.

VI

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Effort versus Ability

We now explore policy implications of these new estimates. At a basic level, they suggest distinct
input-specific policy levers for influencing student and school outcomes via shifts in ability and
effort, respectively. Accordingly, we assess whether incentive reforms that target teacher effort
are likely to be more cost-effective than policies that target teacher ability.
In order to do so, we present a novel framework that allows incentive reforms to be compared
with alternative policies, based on their respective benefits (in terms of test score output) and
associated financial costs. The framework has two key components: first, a method for credibly
estimating the cost required to bring forth one extra unit of output under the incentive reform,
and second, a means of cost-equating the two types of reform to ensure comparability. The
resulting cost-effectiveness comparisons are new to the education policy literature.
than a strict enforcement of the rules would dictate.
41
The standard deviation of ēN
s,02−03 across schools in 2003-04 is 0.27 developmental scale points. Multiplying
0.27 by ρ̂ = 0.29 gives an effect of 0.078 developmental scale points, or 0.8 percent of a student-level standard
deviation.
42
The estimate of µ in the fullest specification in column (3) is 0.39 developmental scale points, or less than 5
percent of a student-level SD of the test score – not economically significant. It is also less precisely estimated
than the other parameters.

24

We start this section by laying out the structure of the two policies we compare. Then we
compute the benefits and costs of the ability-based reform, before describing the first and second
key components of the framework. The headline numbers from the cost effectiveness analysis
will make clear that the incentive reform comes out ahead by a substantial margin. We then
present a thorough sensitivity analysis to explore the robustness of our findings, and also discuss
possible extensions, given that our policy analysis represents a first step and not the last.
VI.A

Two Types of Reform being Compared

Ability-based reforms seek to improve average teacher productivity through the dismissal of
low-performing teachers. They have featured prominently in recent work, with Hanushek (2009,
2011), CFR (2014b), and Rothstein (2015) all analyzing policies that replace teachers whose
value-added falls in the bottom portion of the measured distribution (for example, the bottom
five percent).43 Accordingly, we consider an ability-based reform that involves dismissing the
bottom five percent of teachers in the VA distribution, drawing on that prior literature to provide
credible estimates of the implied benefits and costs of the reform, useful for the comparison below.
The incentive reform we analyze uses the ABCs already in place in North Carolina as a
template, which we scale to make it directly comparable to the ability-based reform. As with
NCLB, it features performance targets, although these targets are student-specific rather than
common to all students in a given grade. As such, all students are made marginal with respect
to the scheme and not just a subset found close to a common threshold target. The incentive
reform offers monetary rewards rather than non-pecuniary penalties (as under NCLB), which
will allow a comparison to be made with the financial costs of the ability-based reform already
estimated in the prior literature.
VI.B

The Ability-Based Reform: Benefits and Costs

We now describe how the benefits (in terms of test scores) and the financial costs of the abilitybased reform are calculated, drawing on the prior literature and our estimates above.
Benchmark estimates of the achievement benefits for ability-based reforms come from CFR
(2014b). Those indicate that replacing teachers in the bottom five percent with random draws
43

The literature has also focused on reducing the attrition of the highest rated teachers. Existing research
(CFR 2014b) suggests that focusing on the top is less cost effective than replacing the lowest rated teachers,
which motivates our focus on the latter.

25

from the distribution of new teachers results in an average two standard deviation improvement
in teacher ability (measured in student test score units) for that subset. We take those values
as a basis for estimating the benefits of a similar ability-based policy in our setting. A two
standard-deviation improvement in performance for the five percent of teachers at the bottom
of the distribution who are replaced translates into a performance improvement of 0.1 (= 2×0.05)
teacher-level standard-deviations across the full distribution of teachers – the short-run benefit
of the ability-based reform.
To calculate the long-run benefit, we use our estimates of the persistence of teacher ability.
These indicate that 19 percent of the initial effect persists four years into the future, implying
that the ability-based reform achieves a performance improvement of 0.019 (= 0.1×0.19) teacherlevel standard deviations over that horizon. To express this long-run gain in terms of test scores,
we note from Section IV.A that one (teacher-level) standard deviation is 1.79 developmental scale
points, giving a long-run effect of the ability-based reform of 0.034 (= 1.79×0.019) developmental
scale points.
In terms of the costs, it is well-appreciated that ability-based reforms create increased employment risk for teachers throughout the distribution due to estimation error in value-added
measures. Rothstein (2015) estimates that compensating teachers for the increased risk would
require a mean salary increase across all teachers of 1.4 percent, which amounts to an average increase of $700 per teacher in North Carolina, where the mean salary is approximately
$50,000. Thus we assume that implementing the ability-based reform in our setting comes at
this additional cost of $700 per teacher.
VI.C

The Incentive Reform

We wish to compare the ability-based reform with a viable incentive reform; here, the ongoing
ABCs serves as a suitable template. In order to use that, we first need to recover the underlying
mapping between output (measured by test scores) and expenditures (in dollars), the latter
representing the pecuniary reward required to generate extra output through heightened effort
incentives. We will think of this mapping in an incremental sense: the cost, based on the
pecuniary rewards associated with ABCs-type accountability incentives, required to bring forth
one additional unit of output. The incremental expenditure-output mapping in hand, we can
then project the cost of attaining any given additional quantity of output. This will allow us,

26

via the second component of the framework, to calculate the benefits and costs of alternative
settings of the incentive reform in ways that can be compared directly to other policies – in the
current instance, the ability-based reform whose benefits and costs we have quantified.
The Output-Incentive Expenditure Mapping:

We now explain how the output-expenditure

mapping can be estimated in a credible way using the North Carolina data, starting with an
intuitive account of our estimation procedure and introduce the key institutional features we
draw on. We then lay out the series of steps involved in more detail, given that the approach is
of independent interest.
Our primary goal (as noted) is to uncover the incremental dollar cost of a one-unit increase
in output, measured by test scores, which can be written heuristically as dC/dy.44 This response
is not observed. It can, however, be recovered using the relationship:
dC
dC
de
=
× ,
dy
de
dy

(13)

noting that the two incremental responses on the RHS are estimable.
To estimate these components in our setting, we take advantage of two facts. First, the
ABCs system uses monetary rewards, and second, there is necessarily a dynamic link between
any NCLB effort response in 2002-03 (which is a response to non-pecuniary sanctions) and the
ABC targets in 2003-04, given the way incentives are set under the value-added ABCs.
These facts allow us to leverage the introduction of NCLB in 2002-03 and the change in
effort it engendered in that year (documented clearly above). Specifically, by altering the ABC’s
targets, the NCLB ‘shock’ provides exogenous variation in both financial rewards (the targets
became harder to attain, lowering the expected payout) and also in effort, as schools responded
to the induced ABCs incentive shock, leading to higher scores. These two sources of exogenous
variation then allow us to estimate (i) the expected financial loss resulting from the increase
in effort under NCLB (from which we can recover

dC
de ),

and (ii) the test score effects of the

increased effort response due to stronger incentives under the ABCs,45 which can be inverted to
give

de
dy .

We then combine these two effects, as in (13), yielding the desired mapping between

expenditures and output that is central to the pecuniary reward-based class of schemes we focus
44

The basic notation here is intended to fix ideas. We will introduce more precise notation when laying out the
relevant steps in detail.
45
Those incentives can be expressed as a function of school-level effort, as we will see.

27

on.
The Four Steps:

We now describe the first component of the policy framework in more

detail.46 This involves the following four steps, also summarized in Table 5.
Step 1 - Calculating Schools’ Expected Financial Losses Under the ABCs.

School

effort responses to the introduction of NCLB in 2002-03 raised the targets that schools faced
in 2003-04 under the ABCs – automatically so, given the value-added incentives under the latter. Following the prescribed school growth score calculations under the ABCs and using the
production technology given by equation (4), we estimate the degree to which school responses
to NCLB in 2002-03 lowered the probability of passing the ABCs in 2003-04 (relative to the
probability in the counterfactual scenario in which NCLB was not enacted), writing this difference ∆Fs for school s,47 where F (·) is the cdf of the school-level test score noise. Multiplying
the differences in these passing probabilities by the ABCs bonus payment of $750, received by
teachers when their school satisfied its growth target, determines the expected per teacher dollar
loss for each school because of its response to NCLB’s introduction.
Based on our preferred estimate, the average school stood to lose $122 per teacher in 2003-04
because of its effort response in 2002-03.48
Step 2 - Calculating the Change in Financial Incentives for a Unit Change in Effort.
Next, to compute the change in 2003-04 financial incentives for a one-unit change in school effort
from the previous year, we regress the expected dollar value each school stood to lose in 2003-04
(from Step 1) on average school-level effort from 2002-03. The resulting estimate β̂ measures the
response

the ABCs bonus payment of $750.
In our central case, a one-unit increase in average school-level effort in 2002-03 would lead
to an expected financial loss of $146.
Step 3 - NCLB’s Effect on Subsequent Student Test Scores:

Next, we need an estimate

of the impact of lagged school-level effort on test scores in 2003-04. This is captured by the
parameter ρ, which can be written explicitly as the incremental effect of school-level effort on
scores,

dy
.

It represents the effect of ABCs financial incentives (which NCLB alters – see

Step 1) on test scores due to changes in teacher effort. We recovered this parameter precisely in
Section V, estimating ρ̂ = 0.29.
Step 4 - Relationship between Test Scores and Changes in Financial Incentives:

We

then estimate the effect of test scores on financial incentives due to increased teacher effort by
dividing the effect of lagged effort on subsequent financial incentives (from Step 2) by the effect
of lagged school-level effort on subsequent test scores (from Step 3).49
Our preferred estimates indicate that the ABCs offering $504.70 per teacher would generate
a one developmental scale point increase in test scores in the short run.
VI.D

Policy Comparison Framework and Headline Estimates

The estimates of the underlying output-expenditure mapping feed into the second component of
our policy analysis directly. This component allows us to place incentive reforms on a common
footing with alternative policies, based on their respective costs and benefits.
In order to do so, we make the following scaling assumption:
Assumption 5 – Linear Scaling: a discrete change, ∆C, in the financial rewards associated
with the candidate incentive reform will generate a discrete change in output, ∆y, equal to
dy/dC × ∆C.

Under this assumption, the policy maker can compute the implied benefits and costs of the incentive reform in a way that is directly comparable to alternative policies (equating the financial
costs and comparing the output benefits of each, for example) The cost (or benefit) projection that is implied utilizes the output-expenditure mapping estimated above; in an extensive
robustness analysis that follows, we examine the sensitivity of the resulting projections.
To illustrate the approach, we focus on a comparison involving the ability-based reform
described above. Recall that this reform costs an estimated $700 per teacher, and generates
output (test score) benefits of 0.179 developmental scale points in the short run and 0.034
developmental scale points in the long run (after four years).
Our preferred estimates indicate a pecuniary incentive scheme with the same structure as
the ABCs but offering $504.70 per teacher would generate a one developmental scale point
increase in test scores in the short run. Using the linear scaling assumption to equate costs with
the ability-based reform, the resulting test score increase produced by a cost-equating incentive
reform that offered $700 per teacher would equal 1.39 (= $700/$504.70) developmental scale
points in the short run.
To compute the long-run gain (in terms of test score ‘output’), we impute the long-run
persistence rate of effort by scaling our ML estimate of the one-year persistence rate (reported
in Table 4). We do so in a way that gives the same rate of decay for teacher effort as the rate
we estimate for teacher ability over a four-year horizon in Figure 5.50 On that basis, the ABCs
offering $700 per teacher would generate a long-run performance gain of 0.064 (or 1.39×0.0463)
developmental scale points, greatly exceeding the corresponding benefit under the ability-based
reform: for the same expenditure, the incentive reform is fully 88 percent more efficient.
Our policy comparison lends itself naturally to a simple graphical representation, in which
each reform is shown as a point in output-expenditure (benefit-cost) space. This can be understood as the combination of the extra output and extra expenditure entailed by the given
reform, relative to the status quo in which no policy is enacted.
Figure 8 illustrates the policy comparison we have in mind. The ability-based reform (represented by point A) has a known cost Ca and output ya , provided by estimates from the prior
literature. The incentive reform is represented by the linear cost function C(y) with slope
50

dC
dy ,

Specifically, Figure 5 shows that the effect of ability on test scores four periods into the future is 46.3 percent
of the ability effect one period into the future (i.e., 0.19/0.41). Assuming the same pattern for the effects of effort,
the effect four periods ahead amounts to 4.63% (i.e., 0.10 × 0.463) of the initial effort effect.

the same as the ability-based reform (C(ye ) = Ca ). As drawn, the slope of the cost function
implies that ye > ya , which means that the incentive reform is more cost effective than the
ability-based reform. In general, the incentive reform is more cost effective if

that is,

the slope of the function is flatter than the line connecting the origin and point A.
VI.E

Policy Analysis: Robustness and Extensions

The preceding framework permits the first cost effectiveness comparison to be made between
incentive reforms and alternative education policies. The main estimates from applying the
framework are striking. They indicate that implementing the incentive reform would involve a
substantial benefit gain for the same cost as the ability-based reform under consideration – 88
percent more output for the same cost in our preferred specification – making them significantly
more cost effective in the long run. This is despite the stronger estimated achievement effects
for teacher ability than teacher effort. A central driver of the relative magnitudes of the new
cost effectiveness estimates we provide is the following contrast: by design, ability-based reforms
are only effective for a subset of teachers, while incentive reforms can be applied to all teachers.
Our policy framework allows the robustness of this cost effectiveness advantage to be explored in a systematic way. There are several relevant dimensions: (i) the variance of the
school-level test score noise, a key determinant of the school passing probability under the
ABCs accountability system; (ii) whether a short- or long-run perspective is taken; and (iii)
the combination of parameters governing the incentive cost of an extra unit of output. We
summarize the main findings along each dimension here.
Variance of the school-level test score noise. Table 6 shows the calculations that underpin
the output-incentive expenditure mapping estimates based on our four-step procedure. The
columns reflect different values of the standard deviation of the school-level test score noise.
Our preferred estimate, already referenced, is a standard deviation of 0.36 developmental scale
points.51 Row (4) of the table shows that the implied expenditure under the incentive reform
for one extra unit of short-run output is already less than the $700 per-teacher cost under the
51

See Appendix F for the justification.

31

ability-based scheme (which delivers only 0.179 units of output) for all values of the SD other
than SD=0.1; our preferred estimate yields a cost well below $700.
Time horizon. In Table 7, we compare the two types of reform over short- and long-run
horizons. Over either horizon, the relative attractiveness of the incentive reform is increasing in
the SD of the test score noise (shown across the table’s columns). In the short run (one year),
the incentive reform has a pronounced absolute advantage, reflected in the values in row (3) of
Panel (a) – all above an output ratio of 4.5 for the same per-teacher cost of the reform. Because
teacher effort is less persistent than ability, the advantage enjoyed by the incentive reform is less
pronounced in the long run, especially for small values of the SD (see row (3) of Panel (b)).
Parameter values. Two key parameters determining the cost of generating one additional
unit of output are the effect of effort on output (ρ) and the cost of higher effort (β), respectively.
In Figure 9, we show combinations of the two parameters, below the upward-sloping line, for
which the incentive reform is more cost effective in the long run. The point defined by our actual
estimate for ρ – obtained from the ML procedure – and our preferred estimate for β falls well
inside the region where the incentive reform has the cost advantage. The figure also depicts
95 percent confidence intervals around each parameter estimate, showing that almost the entire
area defined by the confidence intervals of the two estimates falls within the region of ρ and β
combinations where the incentive reform is more cost effective. As such, the incentive reform
comes out ahead in a range of relevant cases.
The persistence rate of effort, γ1e , estimated to be 0.10 (see Table 4), is another important
parameter relevant to the policy comparison. Increasing it has two effects. First, effort then
persists more in the long-run (because we impute the four-year persistence rate from γ1e ), implying the incentive reform achieves greater long-run output for the same cost. Second, increasing
γ1e results in a smaller expected financial loss for each school under the ABCs (estimated in Step
1 above), lowering the cost of test score gains.52 Both effects work to make the incentive reform
relatively more cost-effective. Figure 10 captures this reasoning: it reproduces the main results
from Figure 9, but shows how higher values of γ1e expand the region in which the incentive
reform is more cost effective.53
52

Greater student learning gains due to higher effort persistence make it less costly for schools to raise ABCs
targets, resulting in a lower estimated value of β (from Step 2 above) – the financial cost of one more unit of
effort, which also reduces the per-teacher cost of one more unit of output (given by βρ in Step 4 above).
53
Specifically, we consider the lower and upper bounds of the 95 percent confidence interval of our estimate,

32

In sum, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the incentive reform remains more cost effective
than the comparable ability reform across a range of circumstances, in line with our main
estimates.
Extensions:

One can think of various ways in which the basic approach could be augmented:

here, we list several. First, policies could be implemented that were a weighted average of
the separate incentive and ability-based policies we compare. One might also consider the
extensive margin effect of ability-based and/or incentive reforms on the stock of teachers, as
the threat of dismissal or sharpened incentives could affect teacher turnover via participation
constraints. Losses and gains may have asymmetric effects on teacher behavior, making rewardbased incentive reforms more or less efficient than sanction-based reforms: it would be interesting
to extend the analysis to allow for such potential asymmetry. In a similar vein, the use of
extrinsic incentives could influence the intrinsic motivation of teachers, which would represent
an additional cost of incentive-based policies.
Having noted these possible extensions, overall we view our policy analysis as a useful first
step in placing incentive reforms in education on a comparable footing with alternative policies.

VII

Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown how measured teacher performance is influenced by accountability
incentives, in the process shedding light on the importance of teacher agency. Central to the
analysis was an approach for separating out two unobserved education inputs for the first time:
teacher effort, which is responsive to accountability incentives, from teacher ability, which is not.
Our identification strategy leveraged a natural experiment associated with the introduction of
a federal accountability program (NCLB) in a setting – the state of North Carolina – where
accountability incentives already operated. Specifically, we drew on the proficiency-count design
of NCLB to construct a measure of incentive strength for each teacher, showing a positive linear
relationship between teacher value-added and this incentive measure in the year NCLB was
introduced but not in prior years. We then exploited these incentive differences over time to
separate teacher quality into teacher ability and the effort response to NCLB, allowing us to
equal to 0.06 and 0.14, respectively. (As above, we multiply these values by 0.463 to impute the four-year
persistence rate, obtaining long-run estimates of 0.028 and 0.065.) As expected, raising γ1e to 0.14 rotates the
black line up, resulting in a larger region of (ρ, β) combinations where the incentive reform has the advantage.

33

gauge the respective impacts of effort and ability on contemporaneous scores.
To measure the extent to which these two potentially important education inputs might
persist differentially, we then developed an approach built around the education production
technology. This allowed us to identify the persistence of effort separately from teacher ability
and the effects of contemporaneous incentives. Here, we found that effort persists at approximately 25 percent of the persistence of ability, the latter having a significant positive effect on
future test scores. The estimates indicate that teacher effort is both a productive input and
one that is responsive to incentive variation in a systematic way, with longer-term benefits for
students.
We then used the estimates and the technology to conduct a novel policy comparison. While
incentive-focused education policies have become increasingly widespread over the past two
decades, how they compare with alternatives has remained under-explored. This paper proposed
an approach for computing the cost effectiveness of feasible policies (including incentive-based
reforms) on a comparable basis for the first time in the education literature.
Our analysis indicated that using formal incentives constitutes a viable means of raising student and school performance. For the same per-teacher cost, we found that the incentive reform
can deliver significantly higher output than comparable ability-based reforms – an advantage
that holds across a variety of circumstances. This is attributable to the fact that incentive
reforms can apply throughout the value-added distribution while ability-based reforms focus on
a subset. Overall, the analysis shows that incentive reforms are worth considering seriously as
a viable tool for education policy makers.
The general approach serves to open up a fuller comparison of the cost-effectiveness of
alternative policies, based on refinements to the estimation strategies we develop – for instance,
looking at the longer-run persistence of effort, and the teacher’s explicit effort-setting decision
itself. These are areas we are exploring in related research.

Notes: Summary statistics are calculated for all third through fifth grade
student-year observations from 1996-97 to 2004-05.
(a) ‘Future’ mathematics and reading scores are the scores we observe for our
sample of third through fifth grade students when they are in sixth, seventh,
and eight grades. They are used to measure the persistent effects of teacher
ability and effort. We do not follow students past 2004-05, as the mathematics
scale changes in 2005-2006, yet no table to convert scores back to the old scale
was created by the state.
(b) The free or reduced-price lunch eligibility variable is not available prior to
1998-99.

Notes: This table presents means and standard deviations of the main performance-related teacher
variables. Summary statistics for Estimated Ability are calculated using all teacher-grade observations from 1996-97 to 2001-02, where we include a teacher in a grade-specific distribution if she
is ever observed teaching in that grade; a given teacher can be in more than one such distribution.
The Observed SD is the raw standard deviation, while the Estimated SD is the estimate of the
true standard deviation of teacher ability, obtained from the EB procedure. Summary statistics
for the fraction of marginal students in classrooms are calculated using all available teacher-year
observations from 1996-97 to 2002-03. (Because second grade scores are not available in 1996-97
and due to the change to the mathematics developmental scale in 2000-01, we are unable to calculate marginal status for third graders in 1996-97 and 2000-01, and for fourth and fifth graders in
2001-02.) Summary statistics for Estimated Effort are calculated across all teacher observations
in 2002-03.

Notes: This table presents estimates of the impact of incentives on teacher performance, where incentives are
captured by the fraction of marginal students (mjt ) within classrooms and teacher performance is measured
using teacher-year fixed effects. (The reported coefficients are given by ψ from grade-specific regressions
of equation (7).) In the year 2002-03 regression, additional controls include teacher ability and teacher
experience. The estimate in the pre-NCLB columns comes from a pooled regression of all pre-NCLB years
that also includes year fixed effects. For third grade, the pre-NCLB years cover 1997 to 2000 and 2002, and
for fourth and fifth grade, 1997 to 2001. Standard errors clustered at the school level appear in parentheses.
*** denotes significance at the 1% level.

Notes: This table presents estimates for each of the four steps in the procedure to recover the output-expenditure relationship, described in
Section VI.C. The unit of observation is a school in 2003-04 (N = 1, 250). The columns correspond to different values of the standard deviation
of the school-level error term (listed in the column headings); our preferred estimates are given in bold, under the “0.36” heading. In Panel
(a), we calculate the expected per-teacher loss associated with the effort response to NCLB. Specifically, the average school passing probability
is reported in row (1) for the counterfactual scenario in which NCLB only operated in 2002-03, and in row (2) for the counterfactual scenario in
which NCLB was never enacted. Row (3) gives the average of the differences in passing probabilities for each school across the two scenarios.
Row (4) multiplies this difference by the per-teacher bonus payment under the ABCs to calculate expected financial loss per teacher, averaged
across all schools. In Panel (b), we regress the expected financial loss on average school-level NCLB effort from 2002-03, and report the resulting
estimates under each value of the school-level error term. Standard errors are reported in parentheses. Panel (c) records the estimated effect
of 2002-03 effort on test scores in 2003-04, common across all columns; it is the estimate of ρ from Table 4. Panel (d) reports the incentive cost
of a one-unit increase in school-level output (due to increased teacher effort) as the SD of the school-level noise increases, from left to right.

Notes: This table presents test score gains under cost-equated ability and incentive reforms in both the short run (Panel (a))
and long run (Panel (b)). In rows (1) and (2) of each panel, test score ‘output’ is measured in developmental scale units; for
reference, the standard deviation of the student-level test score is 10 developmental scale units. In row (1) of Panel (a), output
in each column under the incentive reform is determined as 700 · dy/dC, where dC/dy is calculated in Panel (d) of Table 6; in
row (1) of Panel (b), output is calculated as (700 · dy/dC) · γ4e , where γ4e is estimated as 0.0463. Row (3) of each panel equals
the ratio of row (1) to row (2) output. The columns correspond to different values of the standard deviation of the school-level
error term (listed in the column headings); our preferred estimates are given in bold, under the “0.36” heading.

Notes: The panels in this figure plot the relationship between teacher-year VA measures and the fraction of marginal
students within a classroom in the academic year 2002-03. To construct the figure, we first group teacher-year observations
into 20 equally-sized (vingtile) bins of the distribution for third, fourth, and fifth grade of the fraction of marginal students
on the horizontal axis. Within each bin, we calculate the average proportion of marginal students and the average teacheryear VA estimate. The dots in each panel represent these averages in 2002-03. The lines represent the associated linear
fits, estimated using the underlying teacher-year data.

the distribution of ability across all teachers. Panels (b), (c), and (d) show the distributions for teachers in third, fourth
and fifth grades, respectively. We include a teacher in a grade-specific distribution if she is ever observed teaching in that
grade; a given teacher can be in more than one grade-specific distribution.

Notes: This figure plots teachers’ 2002-03 effort responses. In panels (a) to (c), we present grade-specific partial relationships between teacher-year effects and the fraction of students in a teacher’s class who are marginal. To construct these
figures, we first residualize mjt with respect to the other controls in equation (7). For the pre-NCLB years, these controls
also include year fixed effects. The horizontal axis measures residualized mjt . We group teacher-year observations in 20
equal-sized groups (vingtiles) of the residualized mjt distribution on the horizontal axis. Within each bin, we then calculate the average residualized mjt and the average teacher-year effect. The circles in each panel represent these averages.
The lines represent the estimated linear effects using the underlying teacher-year data.

by taking the linear prediction (fitted value) from e(mj2003 ) = ψ̂mj2003 . We then plot the distributions of these effort
levels separately by grade.

in the pre-NCLB period from 1996-97 to 2001-02. The horizontal axis measures
the number of years separating students from their period-t teacher while the vertical axis measures the impact of the period-t teacher on students’ test scores in
period t + n. The dots represent the estimated effects and the dashed lines, 95
percent confidence intervals with the associated standard errors clustered at the
school level.

Notes: This figure shows the effect of accountability incentives on fourth grade mathematics scores. It
is constructed as follows: In both years, we calculate a predicted score for each fourth grade student and
then subtract off the known proficiency score target from this prediction – the horizontal axis measures
the difference. We then group students into 2-point width bins on the horizontal axis. Within each bin,
we calculate the average (across all students) of the difference between students’ realized and predicted
scores. The circles represent these bin-specific averages, the solid circles representing academic year
2002-03 averages, and the hollow circles, academic year 1999-00 averages. The figure also shows the
associated 95 percent confidence intervals for each year. Standard errors are clustered at the school
level.

Notes: This figure plots the student-specific effort function. The horizontal axis
measures incentive strength (as in Figure 6). To construct the smooth curve,
we first form bins on the basis of incentive strength, then take the bin-specific
differences between the year 2002-03 and the year 1999-00 vertical-axis variable
in Figure 6. The circles represent the resulting within-bin differences. We then
estimate an eight-order polynomial using the binned data, weighting the regression
by the number of student observations (across both 1999-00 and 2002-03) within
each bin.

shift the estimate of β.

Appendix A

Relation to the Prior Literature

In this appendix, we place our analysis in the context of related prior studies, expanding on the
discussion in the Introduction.
Among the studies estimating teacher value-added, most existing strategies in the literature treat
teacher quality as fixed. Yet some recent evidence shows that teacher performance varies systematically
over time and depending on the context – see Jackson, Rockoff, and Staiger (2014) for a detailed review.
The workplace environment has been shown to matter particularly, as the interactions teachers have
with their colleagues (Jackson and Bruegmann, 2009; Papay et al., 2016), the tasks-specific experience
they accumulate (Ost, 2014), and the overall fit with their schools (Jackson, 2013) all affect measured
performance.
Performance incentives – the central focus of our paper – also influence teacher quality. The existing
literature has highlighted the contrasting effects of teacher pay-for-performance schemes on the one hand
and school-level accountability programs on the other – see Neal (2011) and Figlio and Loeb (2011) for
comprehensive reviews of each. Studies of teacher pay-for-performance schemes in the United States
indicate that teacher-level programs are largely ineffective at improving teacher performance (Springer
et al., 2010; Fryer et al., 2012),54 while the effectiveness of group-based programs depends heavily on
program design (Goodman and Turner, 2013; Fryer, 2013; Imberman and Lovenheim, 2015). Schoolbased accountability schemes, in contrast, have been found to change educators’ actions in ways one would
predict based on the incentives embedded in the programs. Proficiency-count systems, for example, have
been shown to lead teachers to direct attention to marginal students, as expected (Reback, 2008; Neal
and Schanzenbach, 2010; Deming et al, 2016), and growth-based programs can lead to resources being
allocated across grades differentially in ways that make target attainment easier (Macartney, 2016).
Popular teacher VA estimators either seek to estimate fixed teacher quality (Kane and Staiger,
2008) or teacher quality that drifts over time according to a statistical process (CFR 2014a), despite the
fact that school-based accountability programs are increasingly widespread in the US, and the evidence
that these programs change teachers’ actions. While these methods identify important heterogeneity
across teachers, based on a fixed component of performance, they do not recover any information about
the influence of (potentially changing) incentives on teacher performance.55 As such, it is difficult to
54

Fryer et al., (2012) find large gains from a non-standard loss-aversion treatment but small gains from a
traditional pay-for-performance program.
55
For a given teacher, teacher VA methods typically construct some weighted average of the (residual) test
scores of the students assigned to that teacher over time. If a teacher is observed many times and incentives
are changing frequently, their influence in the teacher VA estimate may be averaged away. In contrast, when
incentives remain constant over time, standard teacher VA estimates capture a composite of (true) fixed ability
and the component of performance that is responsive to the incentive environment.

51

compare the effectiveness of policies that seek to change the distribution of the teaching force based on
teacher VA with policies that aim to change the incentive environment in which teachers work.
We address these gaps by showing, first, that teacher VA estimates depend on both fixed teacher
ability and the incentives teachers face from prevailing school-based accountability programs, thus highlighting the importance of the agency of teachers in determining overall teacher performance. We then
compare the cost-effectiveness of incentive-based reforms alongside the widely-discussed ability-based reform that removes the lowest-performing teachers based on standard VA measures, showing that incentive
reforms come out ahead in a range of plausible cases.
Our policy comparisons do not consider the potential for either reform to change the types of teacher
who enter the teaching profession. Few existing studies address this issue in a North American context,
although the limited available evidence suggests that both ability- and incentive-based reforms may induce
positive selection into the teaching profession.56 While teacher selection considerations are relevant when
considering the generalizability of the effects of both types of reform, we note in our context that North
Carolina implemented the state-operated ABCs of public education in the 1996-97 school year; this left
ample time for selection to play out following the bonus payment reform prior to NCLB being implemented
in the 2002-03 year. It is therefore unlikely that our proposed incentive-based reform would induce much
additional selection into or out of teaching in North Carolina’s public schools.

56

Dee and Wyckoff (2015) find that a dismissal-based policy in the District of Columbia increased voluntary exit
rates of low-performing teachers, suggesting a further gain from the ability-based reform associated with teacher
self-selection. At the same time, financial incentives offered for high-performing teachers increased retention
at the top of the performance distribution (although the effect was not statistically significant), indicating the
performance incentives may operate in a similar manner. High-performing teachers may be induced to enter and
stay in the profession given the opportunity to earn a bonus payment on top of regular income, as these teachers
tend to have higher earnings opportunities outside the classroom (see Chingos and West, 2012).

52

Appendix B

Data: Implications of Test Score Scale Changes

In this appendix, we discuss the timing of the changes to the developmental scale that the mathematics
and reading end-of-grade tests are measured on. We also draw out the implications of these changes
in terms of our methods for – respectively – estimating teacher VA, predicting student test scores, and
estimating the contemporaneous and persistent effects of teacher effort.

B.I

Mathematics Scale Change

Mathematics scores were measured on different scales before and after 2000-01. Because North Carolina’s
ABCs accountability program required test scores from adjacent years in order to calculate student
growth, the state provided a conversion table for the test scales. We convert ‘second edition’ scale scores
to their ‘first edition’ counterparts for all tests except the third grade pre-test, which is written at the
start of the academic year. The state did not provide a conversion table for that pre-test because both
the pre-test and the end-of-grade test would be on the second edition scale in 2000-01, thus making it
possible to calculate student growth.
While test scores measured on both scales provide a valid way to track student learning, the timing
of scale change and the steps involved in our analyses require us to use test scores expressed one scale or
the other, depending on the task at hand. By way of overview, when reporting summary statistics, we
keep a consistent presentation by expressing all mathematics ‘level’ and ‘gain’ scores on the first edition
scale, except for third grade gains, which are calculated using first edition scores prior to 2000-01 and
second edition scores thereafter. When estimating teacher VA, we also use test scores measured on the
first edition in all cases except for third grade teachers observed after 2000-01 (whose VA we measure
using the second edition). When estimating teacher effort, we only use test scores measured on the
second edition scale because – as explained below – this allows us to predict students’ test scores and
their marginal status more accurately.57 We now explain the implications of the test scale change for our
analyses in more detail.

B.I.i

Scale Change Implications for Estimating Teacher Value-Added

Teacher-Year Fixed Effects: When estimating teacher-year fixed effects for fourth and fifth
grades, we convert all post-2000-01 test scores back to the first edition scale and estimate teacher VA
using a pooled regression covering 1996-97 to 2004-05, based on equation (C.1) in Appendix C below.
Here, both contemporaneous test scores (the dependent variable) and lagged test scores (control variables) are measured on the first edition scale, allowing us to measure fourth and fifth grade teacher VA
57

It is worth noting that all of our results are qualitatively similar if we apply the test scale conversion and
measure effort on the first edition, as we do for teacher value-added (results available on request).

53

on the first edition scale throughout the sample period. For third grade, because we are not able to
convert the second grade test to the first edition scale, we conduct two separate regressions, given the
prior-year test score is needed as a control variable in the value-added estimation: prior to 2000-01, third
grade teacher value-added is measured on the first edition scale, while post-2000-01, it is measured on
the second edition scale.

Empirical Bayes Estimates of Teacher Ability: When estimating incentive-invariant teacher
ability using the Empirical Bayes (EB) procedure in the pre-NCLB period (equation (6) in the main
text), the differential timing of the 2000-01 mathematics developmental scale change in third grade and
the non-availability of second grade scores in 1995-1996 together imply that we have two fewer years of
data for third grade teachers than for those teaching fourth and fifth grade. We therefore estimate a
separate EB regression for third grade teachers, where the sample period runs from 1997-98 to 1999-00
(instead of from 1996-97 to 2000-01 for the pooled regression of students and teachers in fourth and fifth
grades).

B.I.ii

Scale Change Implications for Test Score Prediction

As explained in Section V of the main text and Appendix E below, a component of our empirical approach
involves predicting student test scores in both the year NCLB was introduced – 2002-03 – and in years
prior. We predict scores in prior years in order to conduct placebo tests when NCLB incentives were
not operating. To estimate our prediction equations and categorize students according to their predicted
scores, we opt not to use converted (across first and second edition scales) test scores. Instead, we measure
test scores on the scale that was in effect when the tests were written.58 This prevents us from using a
prediction equation estimated prior to 2000-01 to predict test scores in 2000-01 and after. As a result,
for fourth and fifth grades, the nearest pre-NCLB year for which we have predicted scores to conduct
placebo tests is 1999-00. For third grade, we are able to conduct placebo tests using data from 2001-02.
Here, we rely on the third grade pre-test (second grade test) and the end-of-grade test both being written
and measured on the same scale in 2000-01. We then use data from 2000-01 to estimate the prediction
equation, using that equation and out-of-sample student covariates in 2001-02 to predict performance in
2001-02.
58

Conversion across scales results in lumpiness in the distribution of predicted scores because the mapping
from second to first edition scales is many-to-one – that is, in some instances, more than one test score on the
second edition scale corresponds to the same value on the first edition scale. Because it is important to classify
students correctly according to the distance between their predicted score and the proficiency cutoff, we conduct
the analysis without converting.

54

B.I.iii

Scale Change Implications for Estimating the Effort Function and Effort Persistence

As discussed in Section V of the main text and Appendix E below, we use the difference between students’
realized and predicted scores in 2002-03 to estimate student-level effort when NCLB is introduced, and
the difference between students’ realized and ‘counterfactual’ predicted scores in 2003-04 to estimate the
persistence of effort one year forward. Because we do not convert second edition scores back to the first
edition scale when constructing predicted scores, we must use realized scores measured using the second
edition when carrying out these exercises. Therefore, both initial NCLB effort and its persistence are
estimated using mathematics test scores measured on the second edition scale.

B.II

Reading Scale Change

We do not conduct our main analyses based on reading scores because the scale used to measure reading
tests changed in 2002-03, coinciding exactly with the introduction of NCLB. As mentioned in Section IV
of the main text, there is a potential concern that the timing of the scale change could have provided
the state with an opportunity to change the curriculum or test scale in a way that would have allowed
marginal students to perform better than in pre-NCLB years. In addition, because we opt not to convert
scores between first and second editions when categorizing students based on predicted scores, the timing
of the scale change prevents us from identifying ‘marginal’ students based on reading scores in 2002-03.

55

Appendix C

Estimating Teacher Value-Added: Technical Details

This appendix describes the estimation of teacher VA in some detail: how the sample is selected for
teacher VA estimation, how teacher-year fixed effects are estimated, and how we interpret Empirical
Bayes (EB) estimates of teacher ability in light of North Carolina’s pre-existing ABCs program.

C.I

Construction of the Teacher Value-Added Sample

To estimate teacher value-added, we need to match students in the end-of-grade (EOG) files to their
teachers in an accurate way in any given year. Using data on students and teachers from 1996-97 to
2004-05, we follow previous studies that use the NCERDC data by restricting attention to students in
third through fifth grade, given that the teacher recorded as the test proctor is typically the teacher who
taught the students throughout the year. We follow Clotfelter, Ladd and Vigdor (2006) and subsequent
research by only counting a student-teacher match as valid if the test proctor in the EOG files taught a
self-contained class for the relevant grade and year and if at least half of the tests administered by that
teacher were for students in the correct grade.
When calculating value-added for each teacher, we include a given year of performance data in the
value-added regressions for that teacher only if she had more than seven but fewer than forty students
in her class with valid test scores and demographic variables, following existing studies using the North
Carolina data. A student is excluded from the value-added analysis if any of the following conditions
hold: (1) the student had multiple scores for current or lagged EOG mathematics or reading tests; (2)
the student had EOG scores corresponding to two or more teachers in a given year; (3) the student had
EOG scores corresponding to two or more grades in a given year; or (4) the student had EOG scores
corresponding to two or more schools in a given year.59 Applying these restrictions leaves 1.67 million
student-year observations for estimating teacher VA. Summary statistics for this sample are presented in
Table C.1 below.

C.II

Estimation of Teacher-Year Fixed Effects

As described in Section IV, we compute teacher-year fixed effects for each teacher using all students and
teachers in the VA estimation sample. We follow recent studies and regress contemporaneous mathematics scores on prior mathematics and reading scores and other student characteristics, in addition to the
teacher-year fixed effects that are our main focus. The scores we use are measured on a developmental
scale, rather than being standardized (as is common in the literature, usually at the grade-year level).60
59
Special education and honors classes are excluded from the analysis, but students who repeat or skip grades
are retained.
60
Although standardizing test scores guards against changes in testing regimes over time, de-meaning would
effectively remove the effects of changes in performance incentives: given our goal of assessing how teacher effort

56

Here we rely on the careful psychometric design of developmental scales in a North Carolina context, allowing one to track changes in learning within and across students as they progress through the education
system.
To estimate teacher-year fixed effects, we specify the following grade-specific regressions (for third,
fourth and fifth grades):
yijgst = f (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t−1 ) + qjt + x0ijgst β + ijgst .

(C.1)

Equation (C.1) is the empirical analog to equation (3) in the main text. In bringing the latter to the
data, we control flexibly for the lagged test score, letting f (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t−1 ) be a cubic function of lagged
mathematics and reading scores; teacher-year fixed effects are denoted by qjt , and we include a host of
other determinants of test scores (abstracted from in the conceptual framework).61 Conditional on those
covariates, we obtain teacher-year fixed effect estimates as
n(j,t)

q̂jt =

X yijgst − fˆ(yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t−1 ) − x0ijgst β̂
,
n(j, t)
i=1

(C.2)

where n(j, t) denotes the number of students in teacher j’s classroom in academic year t. The resulting
estimates represent a teacher’s average contribution to her students’ test scores, along with a common
classroom shock that includes mean test score noise (¯
jt ), thus providing the basis for equation (5) in
Section IV. Summary statistics for our estimated teacher-year fixed effects are presented in Table C.2
below.

C.III

Interpreting the Estimates of Teacher Ability with the ABCs

We now interpret our estimates of incentive-invariant ability in light of North Carolina’s pre-existing
ABCs program. In Section IV, we used the EB estimator to recover teacher ability, estimating the
following pooled regression across grades in the pre-NCLB period:
yijgst = fg (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t ) + x0ijgst β + h(expjt ) + aj + θjt + ijgst ,

(C.3)

where aj represents teacher ability, θjt is a classroom-specific shock, and ijgst is student-level noise.
Accounting for the fact that the ABCs program was already operating in the pre-NCLB period, we
affects student learning, we wish to preserve all incentive-related performance variation over time.
61
The other controls, xijgst , serve to mitigate the bias caused by non-random sorting of students to teachers
(Chetty et al. 2014a). They consist of student race, gender, disability status, limited English-proficiency classification, parental education, and an indicator for grade repetition, which is likely to be correlated with innate
student ability and previous teacher assignments.

57

can estimate the same equation but with modified notation, written
yijgst = fg (yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t ) + x0ijgst β + h(expjt ) + µj + θjt + ijgst ,

(C.4)

where µj ≡ aj +ej is the sum of true incentive-invariant teacher ability (aj ) and a term we label ‘baseline’
ABCs effort (ej ). Baseline effort reflects the average ABCs-related effort exerted by the teacher across
all of her years of teaching under the ABCs program. We cannot identify incentive-invariant ability and
baseline effort separately, instead estimating a composite of the two, (a\
j + ej ), for each teacher j.
Our strategy for identifying the variation in teacher performance in 2002-03 that is driven by NCLB
incentives relies on an across-teacher comparison and should be unaffected by our inability to separate
true incentive-invariant ability from baseline effort. This follows from the fact that the ABCs sets only a
school-level target, without associated student-level test-score proficiency thresholds62 – a design feature
that contrasts sharply with NCLB and ensures that effort incentives under the ABCs operate at the school
level.63 As such, the baseline effort component of our EB estimate is likely to be constant across teachers
within a school, implying that our estimates reflect true incentive-invariant ability plus a constant shift
(common to all teachers within a school). As there is little variation in ABCs effort incentives across
teachers, the pre-existing accountability program does not confound our estimation of the effects of
NCLB incentives on teacher performance, given that our identification strategy exploits variation in
NCLB incentives across teachers in 2002-03.
It is unlikely that the introduction of NCLB in 2002-03 created systematic variation in ABCs incentives across teachers (as noted in the main text), given the rules of the ABCs remained constant in that
year. Our identification strategy does permit aggregate changes to ABCs incentives at the school level –
for example, by NCLB drawing attention away from ABCs-related considerations. To separately identify
the variation in performance due to NCLB incentives from the variation due to ABCs incentives, we only
require that ABCs-related incentives do not change across teachers in a way that is correlated with the
strength of NCLB incentives in 2002-03.

62
The ABCs system sets average growth targets at the grade level and then aggregates the differences between
average and target growth across all grades within a school to arrive at a school-level growth score. Under the
ABCs, average test score growth at a school is the key determinant of school success under the program, regardless
of where the growth is concentrated in terms of the underlying student distribution.
63
For a more detailed discussion of the ABCs, see Macartney (2016).

Appendix D

Robustness Checks

In this appendix, we consider the robustness of the results presented in Section IV.B. We also consider
three plausible rival hypotheses to teacher effort setting: (i) differential sorting of students to teachers
by ability, (ii) differential class size adjustments in response to NCLB, and (iii) differential sorting of
students to classrooms based on peer characteristics.

D.I

Alternative Definitions of ‘Marginal Student’

First we demonstrate that the patterns in Figure 3 are robust to alternative cut-offs for defining a student
as ‘marginal.’
Figure D.1 below shows teacher VA in each grade as a function of the fraction of marginal students in
the classroom in 2002-03 and placebo years (for many different definitions of ‘marginal students’). Each
panel of Figure D.1 shows an increasing relationship in 2002-03 and no relationship in the placebo years,
lending credence to the claim that our results do not depend on the way we choose to classify students
as marginal.

D.II

Rival Hypotheses to Teacher Effort Setting

Our leading hypothesis is that the measured test score improvement is due to an increase in teacher
effort in response to the incentives under the proficiency count system. Given that effort is not observed
directly, it is important to consider whether the evidence might be consistent with alternative hypotheses.
In Section IV.B.1, we summarized several such hypotheses, which are explained in greater detail here.

D.II.i

State and Family Responses

Curriculum Content or Test Design:

One might worry that the state responded to the intro-

duction of NCLB by designing new end-of-grade tests or by changing the curriculum in order to make it
easier for marginal students to pass. In either case, marginal students would likely perform better than
expected in 2002-03, possibly inducing the same positive relationship between the proportion marginal
(mjt ) and teacher-year VA, independent of teacher effort. To address such concerns, we focus on the
end-of-grade test in mathematics, as North Carolina used the same test and measured it on the same
developmental scale before and after NCLB’s introduction. The state also maintained the same achievement level test score thresholds, with Level Three corresponding to ‘proficient’ status both before and
after 2002-03.64
64
In contrast, the state issued a second edition of the reading test in 2002-03, the year in which NCLB took
effect. Because of the coincident timing, we opt to not use the end-of-grade reading tests in our analysis.

61

Parental or Student Effort: Another concern is that marginal students and their parents reacted
to the introduction of NCLB by adjusting their own effort. Such responses could generate an association
between marginal student classroom presence and teacher-year VA, independent of teacher effort. Here
we note that the introduction of NCLB did not create new stakes for students and parents, nor did it
present them with new information. Thus it is unlikely that our strategy is affected by parental or student
effort adjustments.

D.II.ii

Other Potential School Responses

It is possible that schools reallocated students across classrooms in response to NCLB. For example,
school principals might have assigned marginal students to higher ability teachers or smaller classrooms
in 2002-03. In such cases, variation in marginal student presence across classrooms in 2002-03 would
also reflect variation in other teacher and classroom characteristics that help determine teacher-year VA,
calling into question whether our estimates reflect teacher effort. We address such concerns next, assessing
whether differential sorting of marginal students to teachers based on (teacher) ability, class size, and
several other classroom characteristics might explain the effects we estimate above.

Sorting Based on Teacher Ability: A natural way to gauge whether teacher sorting could
be driving the results rather than additional effort being exerted by a given teacher is to test if the
relationship between the fraction of marginal students in a classroom and teacher ability changes in
2002-03. We conduct this test by regressing the fraction of marginal students in each class on grade and
year fixed effects (λg and λt , respectively), our measure of teacher incentive-invariant ability (aˆj ), and
an interaction between that term and an indicator for 2002-03:
mjt = α0 + λg + λt + β1 aˆj + β2 aˆj × 1(t = 2002-03) + jt , ∀ t ≤ 2002-03.

(D.1)

If principals began sorting students to teachers differentially on the basis of ability in 2002-03, we would
expect to find a non-zero coefficient (β2 ) on the interaction term.
Table D.1 shows the results from estimating variants of equation (D.1). Overall, there is a small
negative relationship between the fraction of marginal students who are in a teacher’s class and the
teacher’s incentive-invariant ability. This reflects the relatively low test score proficiency standard in
North Carolina and the sorting of low-performing students to low-ability teachers.65 The sorting pattern
appears to change slightly in 2002-03, but indicates that high-ability teachers received smaller fractions
of marginal students than in the pre-NCLB period.66 – for our main results to be biased upward, the
65
The estimates in column (1) imply that a one standard deviation better-than-average teacher has 0.61 percentage points fewer marginal students in her class (which corresponds to a 2.3 percent reduction relative to the
mean fraction).
66
To put the magnitude of the change in perspective, the estimate of β2 in Table D.1 is 0.0033, implying that

62

change would have to be in the opposite direction.
While these analyses indicate that bias due to sorting by teacher ability is unlikely, we conduct a
further test, showing that our main results are unchanged when estimating the effects of NCLB incentive
strength using only within-teacher variation in performance, thereby removing any potentially confounding correlation between (fixed) teacher ability and incentive strength. To that end, we construct the
difference between 2002-03 and 2001-02 teacher-year fixed effects for each teacher j as:
q̂j02−03 − q̂j01−02 = aj + ej02−03 + ¯j02−03 − (aj + ej01−02 + ¯j01−02 )

(D.2)

= ej02−03 − ej01−02 + ¯j02−03 − ¯j01−02 .
The RHS of the first line is written in terms of ability and average effort components, and simplifies (on
the second line) to differences in effort and noise.
We explore whether stronger NCLB incentives caused greater within-teacher performance improvements by relating the difference in teacher-year fixed effects to the fraction of marginal students faced by
each teacher in 2002-03 (mj,02−03 ). To account for mean reversion, we also control for a cubic function
of 2001-02 teacher-year value-added, the estimating equation being
q̂j02−03 − q̂j01−02 = α + χmj02−03 + g(q̂j01−02 ) + ζj02−03 ,

(D.3)

where χ is the main parameter of interest, reflecting any relationship between NCLB incentives and
within-teacher performance improvement, and g(q̂j01−02 ) is the cubic function of 2001-02 teacher-year
VA.67
The panels of Figure D.2 show the partial relationships between the performance improvement
in 2002-03 and mj,02−03 , while panel (a) of Table D.2 reports the underlying slope coefficients (i.e.,
estimates of χ), which are very similar to our main estimates in Table 3. Within-teacher performance
improvements are clearly increasing in the fraction of marginal students in the classroom in 2002-03.
Because the specification in equation (D.3) removes any effect of (fixed) teacher ability, it is unlikely that
differential sorting of students to teachers based on ability can explain our results. A pooled regression
of all pre-NCLB years (with transitions from year t − 1 to t) is used as a placebo control in each grade,
showing a relatively flat relationship, and further supporting the claim that the 2002-03 patterns reflect
a teacher who is one standard deviation (1.79 developmental scale points) below average had (1.79 × 0.0033 =)
0.59 percentage points more marginal students in her classroom in the post-NCLB period. This corresponds to 2
percent of the classroom-level mean fraction of marginal students.
67
Within-teacher fluctuation in performance could be driven by mean reversion when, for example, teachers
with high fractions of marginal students 2002-03 were ‘unlucky’ in 2001-02 and had performed unusually poorly
in that year. In that case, we would expect their performance to improve mechanically from one year to the next,
independent of the new NCLB performance incentives. We account in a flexible way for any such mechanical
relationship between lagged VA and performance improvement with a cubic function of lagged VA, thereby
identifying the effect of NCLB incentives conditional on that relationship.

63

NCLB effort incentives.

Differential Sorting by Class Size:

We also assess the robustness of our results to the possibility

that schools might sort marginal students differentially into smaller sized classrooms in response to NCLB;
such a response could arise if schools thought that marginal students might perform better there. In panel
(b) of Table D.2, we investigate the importance of class size by including it as a control variable and
replicating the analysis in Table 3. None of the point estimates are statistically distinguishable from their
Table 3 counterparts.

Differential Sorting by Other Classroom Characteristics:

As an additional robustness

check, we account simultaneously for any potentially confounding effects from differential sorting of
marginal students by teacher ability, class size, and a host of other classroom characteristics. We do
so by pooling 2002-03 with all pre-NCLB years and estimating the following difference-in-differences
regression:
q̂jt = αj + γt + ψ1 mjt + ψ2 1(t = 2002-03) ∗ mj02−03
+w(expjt ) + ωXjt + ξjt , ∀ t ≤ 2002-03.

(D.4)

This involves regressing teacher-year fixed effects on teacher fixed effects, year fixed effects, the
proportion of marginal students in the classroom, this proportion interacted with a NCLB-period
indicator, controls for teacher experience, and several other classroom characteristics.68
The main parameter of interest is ψ2 , which captures the differential relationship between
teacher-year performance and the fraction of marginal students in the year NCLB is introduced,
relative to the relationship that prevailed in the pre-reform period. The inclusion of teacher fixed
effects and classroom characteristics in equation (D.4) guarantees that ψ2 is identified using
within-teacher variation, conditional on many classroom characteristics. If NCLB incentives
operate independently of teacher ability and other classroom characteristics, we would expect
to find a positive and significant estimate for ψ2 .
The results from estimating variants of equation (D.4) are reported in Table D.3.69 In
column (1), we do not include teacher fixed effects or classroom characteristics, instead accounting for teacher ability using our EB estimates (which, again, are jack-knife or leave-year-out
68
Specifically, the vector of classroom characteristics (Xjt ) includes class size, the classroom average prior math
score, the classroom average prior reading score, and the fractions of students who are racial minorities, disabled,
limited English proficient, male, and who have college-educated parents.
69

64

estimates in pre-NCLB years). The results are very similar to our main results above, as the
relationship between the fraction of marginal students and teacher performance is large and positive in 2002-03 but not in the pre-reform period. Accounting for teacher fixed effects in column
(2) yields very similar estimates, as does dropping the teacher fixed effects while accounting
for classroom characteristics in column (3). In column (4), we account for both teacher fixed
effects and classroom characteristics and again obtain nearly identical results, suggesting that
differential sorting of marginal students to teachers based on ability or to classrooms based on
various characteristics is not first order.
In sum, the evidence buttresses our effort interpretation – none of the robustness analyses
supports the view that differential sorting is driving our main results. Further, we note that
our estimates of the effects of NCLB incentives on teacher performance are not dependent on
the method we use to estimate teacher ability. That is, the specifications given by equations
(D.3) and (D.4) are agnostic as to how teacher incentive-invariant ability is measured, as they do
not require an estimate of ability, yet produce very similar estimates to our main specifications
(where teacher ability is estimated using the EB procedure).

Notes: In Panel (a), we regress the change in teacher-year VA on incentive strength (mjt ) in the year NCLB was
introduced (2002-03) and in pre-NCLB years. (The coefficient estimates are for χ from grade-specific regressions
of equation (D.3).) Specifically, for 2002-03, we regress the change in teacher-year VA from 2001-02 to 2002-03 on
the fraction of marginal students in the classroom in 2002-03 and a cubic function of 2001-02 teacher-year VA. In
the pre-NCLB period, we regress the change in teacher-year VA from year t − 1 to t (using a pooled regression of
all years) on the fraction of marginal students in the classroom in year t, year fixed effects, and a cubic function
of year t − 1 teacher-year VA.
In Panel (b), we present estimates of the effects of the fraction of marginal students within classrooms on teacher
performance. (The reported coefficients are ψ from grade-specific regressions of equation (7).) In the year 2002-03
regression, additional controls include teacher ability, teacher experience, and class size. The estimates in the
pre-NCLB columns come from pooled regressions of all pre-NCLB years that also includes year fixed effects. For
third grade, the pre-NCLB years cover 1998 to 2000 and 2002, and for fourth and fifth grade, 1997 to 2001.

Notes: In this table, we present difference-in-differences estimates from regressions of teacher performance on incentive
strength and incentive strength interacted with a post-NCLB indicator. (The estimates correspond to coefficients ψ1
and ψ2 from equation (D.4).) The dependent variable in each specification is a teacher-year effect. Incentive strength
is given by the fraction of marginal students in the classroom. All regressions include indicator variables for teacher
experience (in bins). Specifications without teacher fixed effects control for incentive-invariant teacher ability using EB
measures of teacher ability. Classroom characteristics include class size, the classroom average prior mathematics score,
the classroom average prior reading score, and the fractions of minority, disabled, limited English proficient, male, and
students with college-educated parents. The sample consists of fourth grade teachers between 1997-98 and 2002-03;
results for third and fifth grade are qualitatively similar. The number of observations in each column is 14,149. Standard
errors clustered at the school-level are given in parentheses. *** denotes significance at the 1% level, and ** denotes
significance at the 5% level.

Notes: This figure illustrates teachers’ 2002-03 effort responses. In panels (a) to (c), we depict the partial relationship
between the change in teachers’ annual performance from 2001-02 to 2002-03 and the fraction of students in their classes
who were marginal in 2002-03. We also depict the partial relationship between the change in teachers’ annual performance
from all years t − 1 to t in the pre-NCLB period and the fraction of students in their classes who were marginal in year t.
To construct the panels, we first residualize mjt with respect to the other controls in equation (D.3). For the pre-NCLB
years, these controls also include year fixed effects. Accordingly, the horizontal axis measures residualized mjt . We group
teacher-year observations in 20 equal-sized groups (vingtiles) of the residualized mjt distribution on the horizontal axis.
Within each bin, we calculate the average residualized mjt and the average change from years t − 1 to t between each
teacher’s teacher-year fixed effects. The circles in each panel represent these averages. The lines represent the associated
linear effects, estimated on the underlying teacher-year data. For notational convenience, the legend in the panels labels
profiles according to the latter year of the academic year in question. For example, the label ‘2003’ identifies the profile
corresponding to the 2002-03 academic year.

Estimating the Persistence of Effort: Technical Details

This appendix presents our methodology for estimating the persistence of teacher effort, supplementing the discussion in the main text. We first summarize the key variables used in our
approach, then describe how teacher effort is estimated at the student level, before deriving the
main estimating equation used in our maximum likelihood procedure.

E.II

Estimating Student-Level Effort

To construct a measure of effort at the student level, we draw on the semi-parametric patterns
in Figure 6 (described in the main text). These show that the introduction of NCLB had clear
71

non-linear effects on student test scores, consistent with strong teacher effort responses to the
incentive scheme. This interpretation draws on two notions: (i) a student’s predicted score, and
(ii) a student-specific measure of incentive strength. We discuss each in turn, before explaining
how they are used to derive the student-level effort measure we use.
E.II.i

Predicted Score

The predicted score for each student in 2002-03, which captures the score the student would have
earned in that year had NCLB not been enacted, is calculated in two steps. First, we predict
student performance in a flexible way regressing contemporaneous 2001-02 mathematics scores
on various controls in the pre-NCLB period,70 and save the estimated coefficients. Second, we
make an out-of-sample mathematics test score prediction for students in 2002-03 by combining
the estimated coefficients from the first step with the (pre-determined) covariates of students in
2002-03, denoting the predicted score for student i in 2002-03 by ŷi,j,g,s,02−03 .
Next, we use equation (3) to express this predicted score in terms of parameters of the
technology – key to being able to uncover NCLB-related effort in 2002-03.
Definition E.1 – Predicted Student Score in 2002-03:

ŷi,j,g,s,02−03 ≡ γyi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,01−02 +

aj(i,02−03) .
The RHS of the prediction consists of only non-effort inputs, setting effort to zero along with any
prediction error.71 Intuitively, this prediction represents the score students would have earned
had teachers not adjusted their effort decisions in response to NCLB’s introduction, given it is
estimated using the relationship between student characteristics and test scores that prevailed
prior to NCLB.
We then use student i’s predicted score together with the student’s realized test score in
2002-03, yi,j,g,s,02−03 , to obtain an estimate of the effort (plus noise) received by each student. In
70
These include cubics in prior 2000-01 mathematics and reading scores and indicators for parental education,
gender, race, free or reduced-price lunch eligibility, and limited English proficiency.
71
Although the prediction error need not be zero at the individual level, our approach for estimating NCLB
effort requires only that it be zero on average, given that we rely on mean differences between realized and
predicted scores throughout the predicted score distribution. We demonstrate below that these mean differences
are indeed centered around zero prior to NCLB’s enactment, supporting the mean-zero assumption.

72

particular, taking the difference between the realized and predicted scores for student i yields:
yi,j,g,s,02−03 − ŷi,j,g,s,02−03 = γyi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 01−02 + aj(i,02−03) + ej(i,02−03) + i,j,g,s,02−03
− (γyi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,01−02 + aj(i,02−03) )
= ej(i,02−03) + i,j,g,s,02−03 .

(E.1)

This differencing gives the sum of NCLB effort and a random shock to test scores on the last
line.72
E.II.ii

Incentive Strength

Our measure of incentive strength is given by the distance between the predicted score (just
T,N
denote this NCLB target in
described) and the fixed NCLB proficiency target. Letting yg,t

grade g in year t (where ‘T ’ in the superscript stands for ‘target’ and ‘N ’ stands for ‘NCLB’),
we define incentive strength in 2002-03 as:
Definition E.2 – Incentive Strength in 2002-03:

T,N
πi,02−03 ≡ ŷi,j,g,s,02−03 − yg,02−03
.

This measure is used on the horizontal axis in Figure 6, in which students are grouped into
two-scale-point width bins of incentive strength in 2002-03. We then plot the average difference
between the realized and predicted score (given by equation (E.1)) within each bin, recovering average teacher effort as a function of incentive strength under the assumption that the
idiosyncratic test score noise has a mean of zero.
E.II.iii

Using the Predicted Score and Incentive Strength to Estimate Student-Level Effort

Figure 6 makes clear that students predicted to score near the proficiency threshold – those for
whom effort incentives are strongest – do on average receive the biggest boost to their scores.
To ensure that we do not systematically under- or over-predict for certain parts of the test score
distribution, we conduct the same exercise in the 1999-2000 pre-reform period (when there is
necessarily no NCLB effort response), showing that our predicted score tracks the realized score
well throughout the distribution, given by the approximately flat line; this supports the view
that the 2002-03 patterns reflect student-specific NCLB effort.
72

The vertical axis in Figure 6 (discussed below) plots averages of the differences given by equation (E.1),
eliminating the influence of test score noise.

73

We then use the profiles for the two years in Figure 6 to estimate a student-specific effort
function that takes incentive strength as its argument. We do so by differencing the binned
2002-03 and 1999-00 profiles and then fitting an eighth-order polynomial to the differenced data
using a weighted regression, where the weights are given by the total number of students in
each bin (across both 2002-03 and 1999-00). The resulting effort function, denoted by eN (·)
and constructed using the estimated coefficients from this regression, is plotted in Figure 7. We
use this function to assign a level of effort to each student directly, according to the following
assumption:
Assumption E.1: Given student-specific values of πi,02−03 and the estimated effort function
eN (·), the effort directed by teacher j to each student i in 2002-03 is given by ej(i,02−03) =
eN (πi,02−03 ).
E.III

The Components of the Estimating Equation

With the student-specific effort measure in hand, we turn to specifying an equation for estimating
effort persistence and other relevant parameters that can be taken to the data.
We start by using (4) to obtain an expression for test scores in 2003-04 as a function of
inputs in that year and inputs from the previous year whose effects persist:
yi,j,g,s,03−04 = γ(yi,j 0 ,g−1,s,02−03 − aj(i,02−03) − ej(i,02−03) )
+ γ1a aj(i,02−03) + aj(i,03−04)
+ γ1e ej(i,02−03) + ej(i,03−04) + ηi,j,g,s,03−04 .

(E.2)

The RHS of this equation captures, on the first line, the persistent effect of once-lagged scores
from 2002-03 excluding teacher ability or effort, written yi,j 0 ,g−1,02−03 − aj(i,02−03) − ej(i,02−03) ,
where the j-subscripts coincide – that is, j 0 = j(i, 02 − 03). Given the technology, we interpret
this component as the persistent effect of non-ability and non-effort inputs. The second line
captures the persistent effects of teacher ability from 2002-03 and teacher ability in the current
year 2003-04; and the third line includes the persistent effects of teacher effort from 2002-03 and
in the current year 2003-04, along with a random shock to current test scores.
From an estimation perspective, the first two lines of the RHS consist of components that
can all be estimated using the prior steps of our estimation procedure. On the third line, the only
74

component that remains to be estimated is contemporaneous effort, ej(i,03−04) , noting the first
term, ej(i,02−03) , can be recovered from the procedure expressed in Assumption E.1. Effort in
2003-04 needs to be controlled for in the estimation procedure to avoid overstating the persistent
effect of effort from the previous year. Given the prevailing incentives in 2003-04, we hypothesize
that contemporaneous effort comes from two sources: NCLB, introduced in the previous year;
and the ABCs, whose incentives are likely to have been disrupted following the effort response
to NCLB in 2002-03. We take these two sub-components in turn.
E.III.i

NCLB Effort in 2003-04

Under NCLB, the descriptive evidence indicates that marginal students are likely to receive the
most teacher effort. To identify marginal students in 2003-04, and thus who is likely to receive
more effort and who less, we need to form a test score prediction in the absence of NCLB effort
being exerted in that year. This will determine who, absent such effort, is likely to be close to
the 2003-04 target and who will be further away.
Here, it is convenient to introduce some notation that will both help to form that test score
prediction and to express the main estimating equation in a convenient way.
C
Definition E.3 – Counterfactual Predicted Score in 2003-04: yi,j,g,s,03−04
≡

γ(yi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,02−03 − aj(i,02−03) − ej(i,02−03) ) + aj(i,03−04) + γ1a aj(i,02−03) .
C
This notation collects the first two lines of (E.2) under the label yi,j,g,s,03−04
. We think of this

as the test score that students would have earned in 2003-04 had NCLB not been enacted in the
prior year.73 The term “counterfactual” reflects the notion that, having isolated the inputs other
than effort that determine test scores in 2002-03, the scores that would prevail counterfactually
in 2003-04 would solely reflect the persistent effects of non-effort inputs from the previous year
plus contemporaneous (2003-04) ability. In effect, we envisage a counterfactual effort decision
on the part of teachers that involves setting ‘counterfactual’ effort in both years equal to zero –
C
74
notationally, eC
j(i,02−03) = ej(i,03−04) = 0.
73

To be very clear, NCLB did occur in that prior year, and did engender an actual effort response, denoted by
ej(i,02−03) . Thus it is necessary to subtract actual effort from test scores in 2002-03 in order to isolate non-effort
(and non-ability) inputs, whose persistent effects we wish to keep track of in 2003-04; the technology assumptions
imply the appropriate ‘recipe’ for purging effort (and ability) effects from once-lagged scores.
74
In the counterfactual scenario, simply plug zero counterfactual effort levels on the last line of (E.2), and this
C
yields yi,j,g,s,03−04
, according to the definition (assuming the test score noise is zero in expectation).

75

In our estimation procedure, we will use an empirical analog to the counterfactual predicted
score in 2003-04. This is constructed along the same lines as the predicted score (ŷi,j,g,s,02−03 ) in
the previous year, which also abstracted from NCLB effort. Specifically, we use the prediction
equations (one for each grade) from the first step of the procedure for estimating student-level
effort above to make forecasts for the 2003-04 academic year by substituting predicted test
scores from 2002-03 (ŷi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,02−03 ) in place of realized grade g − 1 test scores, forecasting
based on the actual 2003-04 values for all other covariates. Realized grade g − 1 scores from
2002-03 contain NCLB effort, and their persistence into 2003-04 therefore depends on the effort
persistence parameter, γ1e . Using predicted scores in place of realized scores ensures that the
counterfactual predicted score represents the score students would earn in 2003-04 in the absence
of NCLB incentives in 2002-03.
Using the machinery just developed, we now discuss teacher effort setting in response to
NCLB in 2003-04. Here, additional structure is needed to capture the way teachers form predictions (drawing on the notation we introduced) about likely student performance in 2003-04
and specifically, how they incorporate the persistence of prior-year effort into those predictions.
We make the following pair of assumptions – about teachers’ information sets and the common
test score prediction rule they follow, respectively:
Assumption E.2a: Teachers know the level of effort devoted to each student in the previous
year, ej(i,02−03) = eN (πi,02−03 ), and the persistence rate of effort, γ1e .
Assumption E.2b: The prediction teachers make about each student’s contemporaneous test
C
score (in 2003-04) in the absence of any contemporaneous effort is given by yi,j,g,s,03−04
+

γ1e ej(i,02−03) .
The prediction draws on the technology directly. According to equation (E.2) and using the
definition of y C above, student test scores in 2003-04 can be written:
C
yi,j,g,s,03−04 = yi,j,g,s,03−04
+ γ1e ej(i,02−03) + ej(i,03−04) + νi,j,g,s,03−04 ,

which is the predicted score in that year plus contemporaneous teacher effort (plus noise). In
line with the previous assumption, teachers use the student-level prediction in 2003-04 to decide
how much effort to devote to each student, taking account of the incentive in the current year

76

to direct effort to student i. That incentive is given by
Definition E.4 – Incentive Strength in 2003-04:

C
πi,03−04 ≡ yi,j,g,s,03−04
+ γ1e ej(i,02−03) −

T,N
yg,03−04
.

Specifically, teachers account for the distance, given by πi,03−04 , between a student’s predicted
score and the NCLB proficiency target, setting effort according to an effort-setting rule expressed
in
Assumption E.3: The effort devoted to student i in 2003-04 is given by θeN (·) evaluated at
πi,03−04 , where θ > 0.
This ‘shape’ assumption implies that teachers rely on the same empirically-determined effort
function as in 2002-03 to set effort, with the given function taking πi,03−04 as its argument in
2003-04, and the parameter θ either diminishing (when θ < 1) or amplifying (when θ > 1) all
effort levels in a proportional way.
To justify this assumption, it is plausible to think that teachers would direct effort to
students in a similar way across the two years, with marginal students receiving relatively more
effort than non-marginal students in each year, given that NCLB incentives remained in place
across 2002-03 and 2003-04.75 Yet the overall effort response across the two years might still
differ if, for example, the novelty and added publicity of NCLB in its first year caused schools
to try harder than they would in future years, with θ reflecting changes in effort over time.76
Given Definition E.4 and Assumption E.3, it is clear that the effort decision in 2003-04
depends on the effort students received in 2002-03 and the effort persistence parameter γ1e , as
these influence incentive strength in 2002-03, highlighting the correlation of effort over time. We
will account for this correlation in our main estimating equation.
75

This assumption serves as an approximation to a more explicit modeling of the effort-setting process developed
in Macartney et al. (2015).
76
As an alternative to having effort levels changing proportionally across years, one might think that teachers
would become better able to predict which students were marginal over time, thereby directing more effort to
those students, which would result in a compressed effort function rather than one that is scaled up or down
by a constant factor. This alternative hypothesis is unlikely to hold in North Carolina, given that the state’s
pre-existing accountability program (the ABCs) relied on the same end-of-grade tests and proficiency thresholds
as NCLB; as the ABCs system was implemented in 1996-97, educators had fully six years prior to NCLB to
become familiar with the state tests and learn how to form expectations about student performance. Teachers
becoming better at predicting student proximity to the passing threshold is more likely to occur in states that
did not have pre-existing accountability programs prior to NCLB.

77

E.III.ii

Accounting for ABCs Effort

The other subcomponent of 2003-04 effort referenced above is associated with changes to effort
incentives under North Carolina’s pre-existing ABCs program in 2003-04. Such changes arise
because of teacher effort responses in 2002-03 following NCLB’s introduction. ABCs incentives
will be affected (in ways we describe below) by changes in prior scores, given that ABCs growth
targets depend on those scores by institutional design.
Our strategy to account for changing ABCs effort decisions draws on institutional features of
the ABCs system and our conceptual framework. In terms of relevant institutional background,
North Carolina’s ABCs program sets test score growth targets that are grade- and subjectspecific for each school. The targets for average test score growth across all students in a
subject-grade are a linear function of students’ prior scores. We can approximate these actual
targets with a single coefficient, α, which multiplies a single prior score in the ABCs target,
capturing the required test score growth rate under the ABCs.77
The growth targets are then aggregated across all grade-subject pairs within the school to
form a school-level growth score for every school in the state. Thus a school passes the ABCs
when the sum of the differences between average and target scores across all grades is greater
than zero. We write the formal condition as
Gs X
X
yijgst − αyi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,t−1
g=3 i∈g

Ngt

≥ 0,

(E.3)

where Gs stands for the highest grade served at a given school.78
To see how an effort response to NCLB in 2002-03 can affect the likelihood of the school
passing the ABCs in 2003-04, use the test score technology and the notation above to write the
passing condition in 2003-04 as

77

In practice, the ABCs program sets grade-specific targets using both prior mathematics and reading scores,
and individual multiplicative coefficients for each. While this is a simplification, the main feature to preserve is
the linearity.
78
In the equation, the first sum is taken over all grades in the school, from third grade up to grade Gs . The
second sum is taken over all students in grade g in year t, and Ngt is the corresponding number of students in
that grade-year combination in the school.

78

which consists of a sum of grade-specific averages (represented by the upper bars).79 The key
term is the difference, (γ1e − α), namely how the persistence rate of effort compares with the
target growth rate legislated under the ABCs. This captures the extent to which the 2002-03
NCLB response changes 2003-04 ABCs incentives. If effort persists at a lower rate than α, then
the target grows at a faster rate than the tests score, implying that the school-level ABCs target
becomes more difficult to satisfy than in the pre-NCLB period: the opposite is true when effort
persists at a higher rate than α. In either case, the change in ABCs incentives should lead
schools to respond by adjusting contemporaneous effort.
Such responses need accounting for in order to separately identify the direct persistent
effect of once-lagged effort on student test scores. To do so, we recognize that for a given
persistence rate of effort and ABCs required growth rate, average 2002-03 NCLB effort is the
key determinant of the distortion to 2003-04 school-level ABCs incentives,80 captured by (γ1e −
P
α) G
g=3 ēg−1,s,02−03 after moving the summation through (E.4).
On that basis, when estimating the persistence of NCLB effort in 2002-03, we control for
average school-level 2002-03 NCLB effort to account for distortions to ABCs incentives. We
state this formally as an assumption.
Assumption E.6: In 2003-04, the effect of the effort response to NCLB in 2002-03 on ABCs
effort incentives (parameterized by ρ) is determined by the average school-level effort response

from the prior year, ēN
s,02−03 =
g=3 ēg−1,s,02−03 , with the change to ABCs effort incentives
being common to all students in a given school.
Because schools’ ABCs effort responses in 2003-04 are unobserved, it is worth pointing out that
our strategy does not control for the responses directly; instead, we hold the effort response
fixed by accounting (based on the reasoning above) for the primary variable that determines the
79

To see how equation (E.3) implies equation (E.4), consider the academic year 2003-04 and note that, given
our framework, the contemporaneous test score may be written as the sum of the counterfactual predicted score in
that year (capturing the effect of all non-effort inputs), contemporaneous effort, the persistent effect of prior-year
effort, and measurement error. Likewise, the lagged (2002-03) test score may be written as the sum of the predicted
score in that year (capturing the effect of all non-effort inputs), contemporaneous effort, and measurement error.
Making the relevant substitutions for contemporaneous and prior-year test scores in equation (E.3) yields

The Estimating Equation

Given the test score technology in (E.2) and definition of the counterfactual predicted score

(yi,j,g,s,03−04
), the main estimating equation is written:

C
yi,j,g,s,03−04 − yi,j,g,s,03−04

Deducting the counterfactual predicted score from students’ realized scores on the LHS allows us
to isolate the three effort responses that are relevant from an estimation perspective. The first
term on the RHS – effort in 2002-03 – is known by the econometrician, determined by incentive
strength πi,02−03 according to the semi-parametric effort function eN (·). The second term, unknown to the econometrician, represents effort in 2003-04, which depends on the key persistence
parameter of interest (given that incentive strength in 2003-04 is partly a function of effort
carrying over from 2002-03). The third term, following Assumption D.6, adds average school
effort from 2002-03 multiplied by the parameter ρ in order to control for ABCs effort incentives
in 2003-04.81 (The underbrace in (E.5) highlights the way that the second and third terms on
the RHS are subcomponents of contemporaneous effort, ei,j,g,s,03−04 , in our formulation.)

81

We calculate ēN
s,2003 as the jack-knife mean 2002-03 effort across all students in school s, leaving out the effort
received by student i, to ensure that the estimates of γ1e and ρ are not confounded.

80

Appendix F

Policy Analysis: Estimating the Output-Incentive Expenditure Mapping

In this appendix, we set out our strategy for estimating the output-incentive expenditure mapping described in Section VI.C in detail.
Key to our approach is the dynamic link between incentives under NCLB and the ABCs.
This dynamic link is apparent from our main estimates, which show that the NCLB effort
response decreased the likelihood of ABCs target attainment the following year. This is because
the persistence rate of effort (γ1e ) is estimated to be lower than the required rate of growth
under the ABCs, given by α.82 For a given change in effort in 2002-03, the persistence of
effort determines the rate at which the test score increases the following year, while the ABCs
coefficient determines the rate at which the target increases. The discrepancy between the two
parameters implies that the ABCs target increased at a faster rate than student test scores, thus
making it more difficult for schools to pass the ABCs, similar to the prediction in Macartney
(2016).
The strategy for estimating the output-incentive expenditure mapping consists of the four
steps given in the main text:
Step 1 - Calculating Schools’ Expected Financial Losses Under the ABCs
First, we calculate the degree to which school responses to NCLB lowered – as the estimates
indicate – the probability of passing the ABCs, relative to a counterfactual scenario in which
NCLB was not introduced. To do so, we calculate the probability of passing the ABCs in
2003-04 under two different scenarios: one in which NCLB never occurred (the benchmark)
and a second scenario in which NCLB was introduced and teachers responded to the prevailing
incentives in 2002-03. The difference in these passing probabilities multiplied by the ABCs
per-teacher bonus payment gives the expected per teacher loss (in dollars) from responding to
NCLB’s introduction.
Our calculations of these probabilities draw heavily on the structure and estimates from
above. In our discussion of the institutional details of the ABCs in Section E.III.ii, we established
that a school passes the ABCs in 2003-04 when the sum of the differences between average and
82
In particular, we estimate γ1e = 0.10 while the implied coefficient on the prior mathematics score under the
ABCs is far higher, given by α = 0.68.

81

target scores (which are themselves a function of prior-year test scores) across all grades is
greater than zero. This condition is given by equation (E.3) above, which we rewrite here for
convenience:83

Gs X
X
yi,j,g,s,03−04 − αyi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,02−03
g=3 i∈g

Ng,s,03−04

≥ 0.

Relying on the structure of our framework and the definitions in Table E.1 , we can write both
the contemporaneous and prior score in this equation in terms of their respective component
parts, which will facilitate our probability calculations.
Taking these in turn, the contemporaneous test score in 2003-04 is the sum of the counC
terfactual predicted score in that year (yi,j,g,s,03−04
, capturing the effects of all relevant non-

NCLB effort inputs), contemporaneous effort (ej(i,03−04) ), the persistent effect of prior-year effort (γ1e ej(i,02−03) ), and measurement error (ηi,j,g,s,03−04 ). Likewise, the prior-year test score from
2002-03 is the sum of the predicted score in that year (ŷi,j 0 ,g−1,s0 ,02−03 , reflecting the effects of all
non-effort inputs), contemporaneous effort (ej(i,02−03) ), and measurement error (i,j 0 g−1,s,02−03 ).
Making the relevant substitutions into equation (E.3), taking grade-specific means and rearranging yields the following passing condition:

where the grade-specific means are indicated by the upper bars.
We use equation (F.1) to calculate the probability of a given school passing the ABCs in
2003-04 under each of the two scenarios we need to consider. Take first the benchmark scenario
in which NCLB was not enacted in the prior year. We calculate the probability of a school
passing the ABCs in this case by first using equation (F.1) but setting NCLB effort in both
2002-03 and 2003-04 equal to zero (ēg,s,03−04 = ēg−1,s,02−03 = 0) reflecting the fact that there
were no NCLB incentives to respond to in this hypothetical scenario; in terms of our framework,

scores follow the detailed rules for calculating school-level ABCs scores precisely. In particular, rather than take
simple averages, we sum the weighted and standardized grade-and-subject-specific average differences between
realized and target growth scores within each school.

Under the second scenario (allowing for effort in the first year NCLB was introduced), we
wish to isolate the reduction in ABCs passing probabilities caused by the initial response to
NCLB in order to determine the extent to which schools reduced their chances of passing the
ABCs relative to the scenario without NCLB. To that end, we calculate ABCs school-level growth
scores in 2003-04 while only allowing schools to respond with additional effort in 2002-03. We
eliminate subsequent 2003-04 NCLB effort responses in the calculation by setting ēg,03−04 = 0,

Specifically, we let the SD of school-level randomness vary from 0.1 to 1 developmental scale points in increments of 0.1 For comparison, the standard deviation of the school-level ABCs score under the counterfactual
scenario in which NCLB was not enacted is 0.34 developmental scale points. Using even smaller values (between
0.01 and 0.1 for the standard deviation) does not appreciably alter any of our conclusions.

use the fact that both the average counterfactual predicted score (ȳg,s,03−04
) and the average

predicted score (ŷ¯g−1,s,02−03 ) are known quantities and substitute them into equation (F.4)
directly. We calculate average effort in 2002-03 (given by ēg−1,s,02−03 ) by first calculating an effort
level for each student in that year using the student-specific effort function described in Appendix
E above and then aggregating these quantities up to the school-grade level. Further, we can
easily calculate (γ1e − α), as we estimate γ1e = 0.10, and the coefficient on the prior mathematics
score under the ABCs (α = 0.68) is fixed by the institutional arrangements that govern the
program. Maintaining the same distributional assumption as in the first scenario above, the

Panel (a) of Table 6 provides a summary of the school-level passing probabilities under
the two scenarios. As mentioned above, we assess the sensitivity of our analysis to a variety
of alternatives for the standard deviation of school-level average test score noise, given by σ.

For a 0.1 scale-point standard deviation in noise ( G
g−1,s,02−03 )), the average
g=3 (η̄g,s,03−04 − α¯
difference (across all schools) between the two passing probabilities is 20 percentage points,
while it is 8 percentage points for a 1 scale-point standard deviation of noise, and monotonically
decreasing in between. By responding to NCLB in 2002-03, the average school therefore lowered
its chances of passing the ABCs in 2003-04 by between 8 and 20 percentage points. Multiplying
84

these figures by the ABCs bonus payment of $750 implies that, the average school stood to lose
between $60 and $150 per teacher in 2003-04 because of its effort response in 2002-03.
Preferred Estimate for the Standard Deviation of the School-Level Error Term
Prior to describing the remaining three steps involved in recovering the output-incentive expenditure mapping, we describe briefly how we determine our preferred estimate for the standard
deviation of school-level average test score noise, which is 0.36 developmental scale points.85
To start, for each school s, write the average test score noise that appears in equations
P s
g−1,s,02−03 ). This captures the difference in mean
(F.2) and (F.4) as νs ≡ G
g=3 (η̄g,s,03−04 − α¯
test score shocks across adjacent years, with the required growth coefficient under the ABCs,
α, multiplying the prior-year average. While νs is in practice a weighted average (where the
weights are determined by the ABCs’ rules), we take it to be a simple average. Further, we
assume that student-level test score noise follows a stationary process and is uncorrelated –
both within-student over time and across students – within and across years. We also assume
student test score shocks are drawn from the same distribution in each grade.
On that basis, we simplify and write ν̄s = η̄s,03−04 − α¯
s,02−03 as a simple school-level
difference of average student test score noise across adjacent years and calculate its variance as
ση2
Ns

σ
+ α2 N
, where Ns is the total number of students attending school s. Stationarity implies
s

ση2 = σ2 = σ 2 , so the variance is

σ2
Ns (1

+ α2 ). Our estimate of σ 2 is 20.14 developmental scale

points (from the maximum likelihood results in Table 4). The average school size (grades 3 to
5), denoted Ns =, is equal to 227 students and α = 0.68 for grade 4 mathematics. Substituting
these values into the variance expression and taking the square root yields the standard deviation
of 0.36 developmental scale points, which is our preferred estimate.
Step 2 - Calculating the Change in Financial Incentives for a One-Unit Change in School Effort
Equation (F.6) establishes that the degree to which each school lowered its likelihood of passing
PGs
the ABCs in 2003-04 depends on both the average effort it exerted (eN
s,02−03 =
g=3 ēg−1,s,02−03 )
and the difference between the persistence rate of effort and the growth rate of the ABCs target
(γ1e − α) – see the interaction on the first row. Because we find (as noted) that effort persists
(γ1e = 0.1) at a lower rate than the (known) growth rate of the ABCs target (α = 0.68), a

As a reference point, the standard deviation of the school-level ABCs score under the counterfactual scenario
in which NCLB was not enacted is 0.34 developmental scale points.

one-unit increase in school-level effort in 2002-03 lowers the likelihood of the school passing the
ABCs in 2003-04, and correspondingly creates an expected financial loss for each school.
In this second step, we estimate the relationship between these financial incentives and oneunit change in prior NCLB school-level effort. This represents the impact of an additional unit
of effort on schools’ subsequent financial incentives, which we later combine with the relationship
between an additional unit of effort and subsequent student test scores in order to back out the
direct effect of NCLB-induced changes in financial incentives on test scores.
We estimate the magnitude by which additional school-level effort in 2002-03 affected ABCs
financial incentives in 2003-04 by regressing the expected dollar value each school stood to lose
in 2003-04 (given by equation (F.6)) on average school-level effort from the prior year:
750 · ∆Fs = α + βēN
s,02−03 + νs,03−04 .
The estimate β̂, which equals the response

d(750·∆Fs )
,
dēN
s,02−03

(F.7)

governs the magnitude by which a one-unit

increase in school-level effort in 2002-03 lowers the expected dollar amount the average school
stood to gain under the ABCs financial incentives in 2003-04.
Panel (b) of Table 6 reports the estimated coefficients from equation (F.7). The coefficient
ranges from −245.31, when the standard deviation of school-level noise is assumed to be 0.1
to −64.09 when the standard deviation is assumed to be 1. A one-unit increase in average
school-level effort in 2002-03 thus results in an expected financial loss between $64 and $245 per
teacher.
Step 3 – NCLB’s Effect on Subsequent Student Test Scores
Next, in order to link passing probabilities (and the expected financial losses incurred) to scores,
we need the effect of a one-unit change in average school-level effort from 2002-03 on test scores
in 2003-04. This is captured by the parameter estimate ρ̂ = 0.29, already recovered in Section
V.
The parameter can be written explicitly as the effect of lagged effort on scores: ρ̂ =

dy

It reflects the indirect relationship between financial incentives under the ABCs and the corresponding teacher effort responses in 2003-04.

Step 4 – Relationship between Test Scores and Changes in Financial Incentives:
We now scale the effect of lagged school-level NCLB effort on ABCs financial incentives in 20032004 (β̂ =

)

by the effect of lagged school-level NCLB effort on test scores ( dēNdy

This represents the financial cost (in terms of bonus

payment incentives offered) associated with a one-unit (one developmental scale point) gain in
student test scores.
Panel (d) of Table 6 reports the direct effect of financial incentives on test scores, indicating
that a one-unit increase in test scores is associated with a per-teacher cost ranging between $220
and $845. Our preferred estimate implies a cost of $504 per teacher.
