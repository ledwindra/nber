    "abstract": "\n\nMost of the recent literature on risk management and capital structure assumes that markets are perfect, i.e., efficient and complete. This paper presents anecdotal evidence that suggests that different capital markets (e.g., debt, equity and warrants markets) may not be perfectly integrated, and discusses the implications of this lack of integration on financing strategies. I argue that although models that assume perfect markets are sufficient to explain cross-sectional differences in financing and risk management choices within an economy, that issues relating to market conditions may be necessary to explain differences in these choices across countries and across time.\n\n",
