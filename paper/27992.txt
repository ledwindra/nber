ABSTRACT
This paper analyzes the economic impact of the pandemic, providing insights into the
consequences of alternative policies. Our framework focuses on three key features: (a) Covid-19
is a sectoral shock of unknown depth and duration affecting some sectors and technologies more
than others; (b) there are constraints in shifting resources across sectors; and (c) there is a high
level of uncertainty about the disease and its economic aftermath, inducing a high level of
precautionary behavior by some agents and leading to others facing more severe credit
constraints. Because of macroeconomic externalities, precautionary behavior exacerbates the
downturn, and even sectors where Covid-19 does not directly affect consumption or production
may face unemployment. Multipliers associated with different government expenditure programs
differ markedly. The paper describes policies that can mitigate precautionary behavior, leading to
reduced unemployment. Greater wage flexibility may lead to increased unemployment.
The precautionary behavior is the antithesis of equilibrium behavior, suggesting that standard
equilibrium approaches may not provide the appropriate framework for analyzing the pandemic:
individuals know that they don’t know the future, that existing and newly made contracts and
plans may be broken, and that they need to be able to respond to these unknowable contingencies.

The Pandemic Economic Crisis, Precautionary Behavior, and Mobility Constraints:
An Application of the Dynamic Disequilibrium Model with Randomness1
Joseph E. Stiglitz
Columbia University, October 8, 2020
Covid-19 is the largest shock to hit the global economy in living memory—certainly since the
Great Depression. It is a complex shock. It affects demand and supply. It affects different
sectors, different technologies, and different people differently. It has come on with the
suddenness associated with crises, but with few of the warnings associated with an impending
crisis.
It is natural that different economists have turned to the tools at hand to understand what is
happening and to manage things better. Standard models emphasize intertemporal
substitution, and clearly Covid-19 induces intertemporal changes in production and
consumption. But there is clearly much more going on.
As we’ve noted, Covid-19 affects some sectors and some technologies more than others. It can
be viewed as a sectoral shock of unknown depth and duration. Such shocks can, of course,
have macroeconomic consequences, but to study them we need a model with at least two
sectors. Inter-sectoral substitution will, of course, play an important role in determining the
nature and magnitude of the macroeconomic impact. (Guerrieri, Lorenzoni, Straub,and
Werning 2020)
In practice, such substitution is limited, particularly because intertemporal substitution is a
substitute for cross-product substitution: individuals who are discouraged from going to
restaurants today are (especially if they believe the pandemic is of limited duration) less likely
to buy, say, a larger car than to increase consumption of restaurant meals in the post-pandemic
era. Moreover, the substitution that does occur today will take the form of less (market) labor
intensive goods—home meals (with purchases occurring in grocery stores) for restaurant
meals. Thus, at current wages and prices, the demand for labor is likely to decrease.
The same argument suggests that the contention that we need not be worried much about the
effect of short term loss in income on effective demand this period—simply because the
pandemic is short lived and therefore permanent incomes will be little changed, and so
intertemporal smoothing will ensure that today’s effective demand will be little affected (at
This paper is based on joint work with Martin Guzman, and represents an application of ideas developed in
Guzman and Stiglitz (2020). The analysis of macroeconomics with limitations on intersectoral mobility is based on
joint work with Bruce Greenwald, Domenico Delli Gatti, Mauro Gallegati, and Alberto Russo. I wish to

fixed interest rates) is unpersuasive. With a “pandemic tax” on the consumption of certain
goods and services during the pandemic, the intertemporal relative price for goods and services
affected by the pandemic will have changed dramatically, discouraging the consumption of
these goods today. Today’s effective demand will be reduced, and even more so if
consumption of “pandemic affected goods and services” are complements of goods and
services not directly affected, so the reduced consumption of the former leads to reduced
demand for the latter. While there might be adjustments in the nominal interest rate that
could offset these effects, those adjustments may not occur, especially if the economy is
already near or at the zero-lower bound. 2
While Guerrieri et al. stress the demand side, equally or more important in the short run are
supply side constraints. In this paper, we stress the difficulties of sectoral reallocation of
resources, the movement of labor and capital across sectors, from those adversely affected by
Covid-19 to those that might be positively affected. 3 The evidence of supply constraints
abounds, in the inability to get masks, tests, swabs, ventilators, protective gear, as well as
shortages of bicycles and other commodities for which demand has increased. It is these
constraints, as much or more than the nominal wage and price rigidities, which play a central
role in inhibiting the adjustment of the economy to a new full employment equilibrium.
Underlying these constraints is the lack of mobility of labor and the lack of malleability of
capital, for which there is ample evidence. 4
Indeed, we show that making nominal wages more flexible may make matters worse—and
interestingly, in this crisis (as in others), there is some evidence that wages are in fact
downwardly flexible. (Chetty et al 2020).
Thus, one of the objectives of this paper is to analyze the short run equilibrium of the economy
in the presence of mobility constraints, using the modelling techniques developed earlier in
Delli Gatti et al. (2012a,b)—in particular, to enhance our understanding of why the Covid-19
shock is giving rise to Keynesian unemployment, and that Keynesian policies can increase
Although as Fahri et al. point out, there are tax policies that could achieve the same adjustment in intertemporal
prices as an adjustment in nominal interest rates, the political process for making those changes is slow (and in fact
has seldom happened.) As I’ve written elsewhere (Stiglitz 2016), there may be other, more important
impediments to the economy’s being restored to full employment than the zero-lower bound. For our purposes,
all that matters is that intertemporal smoothing does not suffice to restore the economy to full employment in the
presence of the pandemic shock.
3
Earlier macroeconomic literature emphasized another aspect of supply side constraints: the unwillingness of
firms at existing wages and prices to supply beyond a certain amount. Modern macroeconomics, employing
monopolistic competitive model (a la Dixit-Stiglitz), have prices set sufficiently above marginal costs that firms are
willing to supply whatever is demanded. But that assumes that they have sufficient production capabilities to do
so.
4
On the former, see Yagan 2019 and Autor et al. (2013, 2016). The former shows that the unemployment impact
of the 2008 recession would have been much smaller if labor were more mobile, the latter that the impact of the
“China shock” would have been much smaller if labor were more mobile. If capital were malleable and mobile, it
would still be easy to accommodate the shift in the structure of demand resulting from the pandemic without
unemployment. The limitations on the malleability of capital are discussed further in the next footnote.

employment and societal welfare, and especially so for Keynesian structural policies, entailing
active labor market and industrial policies.
A second defining aspect of the response to Covid-19 is uncertainty—an event which has not
happened, at least in living memory, has occurred; and this induces a high level of
precautionary behavior. There is uncertainty not just about the depth and duration of the
pandemic, but also about the economic impacts and the size, design, and effectiveness of the
policy measures intended to control the pandemic and its economic aftermath. There is also
uncertainty about the long-term consequences: to what extent will the pandemic induce
changes in behavior or technology. 5 To some extent, the answer to these questions is not only
unknown, but unknowable, and there is no basis on meaningful (subjective) probability
distributions of the impacts can be formed, and, even if individuals formed such distributions,
little likelihood that there were be general agreement about the distributions.
Precautionary behavior increases the demand not for produced commodities—investment
goods enabling enhanced production tomorrow—but for non-produced assets (e.g. “money” or
other stores of value like land). Once again, Say’s Law doesn’t work: supply does not create its
own demand. There is an obvious reason for this: investment goods have to take on a very
specific form, which is not true for the other stores of value like land money, and in that sense
these other stores of value have greater option value. In the midst of the uncertainty marking
Covid-19, no one knows precisely the shape that the future will take, and a commitment to a
particular asset-form is costly. 6 This is important (as we shall see), because the increase in
precautionary behavior plays an important role in exacerbating fluctuations—and in this case
increasing the unemployment resulting from the pandemic. This is in marked contrast to the
intertemporal substitution which is the focus of the standard model. By and large, that (at least
in the absence of non-produced assets and wage and price rigidities and in the context of farsighted markets satisfying all transversality conditions) results in the stabilization of aggregate
demand. 7

The theory of induced innovation combined with the theory of localized technological change (Atkinson and
Stiglitz (1969)) implies that history matters: events like a pandemic, or the black plague in the Middle Ages, have
permanent effects on the evolution of technology.
6
Thus, while much of DSGE modelling entails perfectly malleable capital, in practice, capital goods are better
described as “putty-clay,” where there is a range of choices of technology before a machine is constructed, but not
afterwards. The dynamics of putty-clay models is, of course, markedly different from those of putty-putty models
(see Cass and Stiglitz (1969)), another important critique of the standard DSGE models. For a discussion of option
value under irreversibility, see Dixit and Pindyck (1994).
7
This is, of course, almost a matter of definition. As we note below, in general there is a market equilibrium with
full employment, but the standard models provide no explanation of how that is attained. Thus, for instance, an
increase in planned consumption in the future as opposed to today leads to an increase in investment, to enable
the economy to provide those consumption goods. See the discussion below.
5

The significance of this is illustrated by data from the US for the second quarter of 2020.
Personal consumption expenditure fell by 34.6% but personal disposable income increased by
44.9%, leading to a sharp increase in the savings rate (25.7% of Q2 disposable income).
The precautionary behavior is, in a sense, the antithesis of equilibrium behavior: precisely
because individuals know that they don’t know the future, they know existing and newly made
plans and contracts (e.g. employment contracts and leases) may be broken, and they know they
need to be able to respond to these unknowable contingencies.
One aspect of these contingencies of which they are aware is that they may not have access to
finance and jobs—there may be credit rationing and unemployment. Indeed, the uncertainties
about the future increase the extent of credit rationing at the moment of the pandemic. These
(uninsurable) uncertainties and constraints on access to credit may play an important role in
shaping effective responses. Targeting money to those who are credit constrained may have
large multiplier effects; money going to those who are building up precautionary balances
against future risks may have low multipliers—akin to Keynes’ liquidity trap. 8 We show that
government expenditures, even in the sector unaffected directly by the pandemic, may reduce
unemployment. And we note that there may be ways of providing assistance which reduces
the demand for precautionary balances and accordingly may have large multipliers.
Outline of paper
The next section presents the basic model, in which the savings rate is fixed, showing how the
Covid-19 shock leads to a short-run equilibrium with unemployment. While the analysis begins
with fixed wages, we show that wage flexibility may lead to increased unemployment. By
contrast, increased government expenditure increases employment.
Section 3 extends the analysis to endogenize savings—showing how the problems described in
section 2 are exacerbated if there is an increase in precautionary savings, and shows that this
may well be the case even if a fraction of the population is credit constrained. The section
considers the appropriate policy responses. Section 4 considers various intermediate and
longer-term equilibria, where resources might be mobile, or at least more mobile. We explain
how policy interventions in the short run may have consequences that persist: hysteresis
effects are pervasive. Section 5 explains why an approach focusing on dynamic disequilibria
with randomness may be more appropriate for analyzing the economic consequences of the
pandemic than the standard DSGE model.

The disparities in spending changes between higher and lower income individuals in the pandemic have been
marked: “High-income households were spending 17 percent less on August 15 than they were in January, while
low-income households, living on the edge, had only reduced their spending by 5 percent. When the federal
stimulus payments reached families in April, low-income families’ spending immediately rose by nearly 20
percentage points, while upper-income families’ spending only rose by 9 percentage points.” Stiglitz (2020) based
on Chetty et al 2020.

2. A simple model of Covid-19 with real labor market rigidities
Covid-19 has introduced an additional cost into certain types of consumption and production
activities: the risk of contracting a potentially costly disease. This acts as a (dissipative) tax on,
say, labor intensive production activities (robots don’t get Covid-19, though they do get other
kinds of viruses) and on certain kinds of service sector activities. Of course, with the
perturbation, there is, within the standard Arrow-Debreu paradigm, a new general equilibrium
with full employment. Because of the “tax” the welfare of at least some individuals will be
lower; the utility possibilities frontier has moved inwards. And almost surely, the competitive
equilibrium without further government intervention will entail a marked decrease in the
equilibrium wages and well-being of the unskilled laborers who are most affected by the
disease. Covid-19 will result in an increase in the level of inequality, from its already high level.
We focus here, however, not on this long run general equilibrium, but on the short run
dynamics. That long run entails labor and capital moving out of sectors like hospitality and
airlines into “zooming” and activities entailing less contacts. In the short run, we assume that
labor is immobile—that the real costs of moving are simply too great or that capital market
imperfections are sufficiently large that those in the sectors adversely affected cannot get the
resources to make the investments required to make them productive in the expanding
sectors.9 We will show that similar results obtain so long as there are costs associated with
mobility.
For simplicity, for much of the analysis we assume that Covid-19 is a “permanent” shock. But as
we will show, the short-term perturbations may be even greater if it is a shock of intermediate
duration—short enough that it doesn’t make sense to pay the high costs of reallocating
resources but long enough that the losses associated with Covid-19 are (in terms of PDV of
welfare) significant. (See section 4 below.)
The structural transformation induced by Covid-19 is at the heart of our analysis, and one can
only study such transformations in a disaggregated model: there must be at least two sectors.
We take the simplest specification, where there are only two sectors, that affected by the
disease (the hospitality sector), and that which is not (zooming). We ignore the additional
complexity resulting from the fact that Covid-19 may also affect the choice of production
technology 10; it should be clear how this can easily be introduced into our framework.
We build up our analysis through a series of steps. In the first, we assume wages and prices in
each sector are fixed, labor can be employed up to the level prior to the shock (where, for
simplicity, it was assumed there was full employment), but not beyond that level (i.e. in the
short-short run, labor cannot be redeployed.) Initially, we assume too that the savings rate is
Similarly, those in the potentially expanding sectors can’t get the resources to make the requisite investments
and/or can’t appropriate the returns to those investments (e.g. when they entail investments in human capital).
10
As we noted earlier, because machines don’t come down with covid-19 they may be more reliable, and thus
covid-19 tilts the balance towards more capital-intensive technologies.

fixed—there is no precautionary response to the pandemic shock. We subsequently relax each
of these assumptions.
Sector 1 will denote the sector adversely affected by the pandemic; sector 2 is not directly
affected. The (short run) production functions of the two sectors are given by 𝐻𝐻1 (𝐸𝐸1 ) and
𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ) respectively, where 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 is employment in sector 𝑖𝑖. Demand for sector 𝑖𝑖 is given by 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 ,
and before the pandemic shock is a function of the relative price of the two goods and
employment income in the two sectors:
𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ). 11

We use units so that the price of goods in the second sector is unity and 𝑝𝑝 is the (fixed) nominal
price in the first sector, and allow workers working in the two sectors to have different
preferences. 12
The pandemic acts, as we have said, as a tax on sector 1 13: 𝐷𝐷1 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ), where 𝜏𝜏
measures the strength of the downward pressure of the pandemic on the demand for goods in
sector 1.
𝜕𝜕𝐷𝐷1
<0
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

The substitution effect means that there is, at any given levels of income, an encouragement of
consumption of the output of sector 2, i.e. the demand function for sector 2 is given by
𝐷𝐷2 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ) , and it is plausible that

𝜕𝜕𝐷𝐷2

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

We denote the initial level of employment as 𝐿𝐿1 and 𝐿𝐿2 , and the no-redeployment constraint
implies that
(1)

𝐸𝐸1 ≤ 𝐿𝐿1 ; 𝐸𝐸2 ≤ 𝐿𝐿 2 .

As in standard models with rigid wages and prices, actual output, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 , in the two sectors is the
minimum of demand and supply 14:
(2)

𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = min{𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 }

In a still more general version of this model, demand depends separately on wages and employment, not just
the product of the two.
12
This model is a “real” model, one where it is assumed that the classical dichotomy holds. It is straightforward to
extent the analysis to a more conventional model where wages and prices are expressed in nominal terms.
13
Later, we consider the case where the pandemic is viewed as a tax on work in sector 1.
14
See Solow and Stiglitz (1968), Barro and Grossman (1971), and Malinvaud (1977). There are additional
complexities that arise in these models because individuals may not be able to sell all the labor they wish to sell or
buy all the goods they wish to buy at the given set of wages and prices. We discuss the implications below.

where 𝑌𝑌1𝑠𝑠 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑤𝑤1 ) is the amount of good 1 that firms are willing and able to supply at price 𝑝𝑝,
given the wage 𝑤𝑤1 and 𝑌𝑌 2𝑠𝑠 (𝑤𝑤2 ) is the amount of good 2 firms are willing and able to supply at
the wage 𝑤𝑤2 (all denominated in terms of the numeraire price of sector 2 good). The quantity
that firms are willing to supply of good 𝑖𝑖 is given by

(8)

𝐻𝐻1 (𝐸𝐸1 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 )

𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 )

For a given 𝑝𝑝, (7) and (8) define equations giving the level of employment in one sector as a
function of that in the second sector. An increase in employment in one sector gives rise to an
increase in employment in the other sector, so that (7) and (8) both define upward sloping
curves. Of course, (1), (2) and (6) provide supply and resource reallocation constraints. Since
we have assumed that the economy was initially (before the pandemic) in equilibrium, the
constraint associated with (1) and that associated with the willingness to supply coincide ((2)
and (6)) coincide, so we can focus just on the former constraint. And since the pandemic
increases the demand for good 2 and decreases that for good 1, it is only the constraint 𝐸𝐸2 ≤
𝐿𝐿 2 which can be binding.
In our short run analysis, we initially assume that 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 and 𝑝𝑝 are fixed. There are two possible
situations, depending on whether labor in sector 2 is fully employed.
2.1 Constrained production of sector 2

For the moment, we abstract from government expenditures, investment, and net exports. We will introduce
these sequentially in the analysis below.
15

7

The simplest is where the restriction on the ability to redeploy labor is binding, i.e. those in
sector 2 would like to hire more labor but can’t, and there is excess supply of labor in sector 1.
Then we can describe the new equilibrium by the equation:
(9)

𝐻𝐻1 (𝐸𝐸1 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 �𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐿𝐿2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 )�

where we have amended the standard demand equation by adding a term “𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 )”. The
standard demand curve is formulated on the assumption that the individual can purchase at
market prices as much as he wishes of any commodity. But here, we have assumed that supply
constraints are binding for good 2, and if that is the case, some of this demand will shift back to
good 1. How much depends on individuals’ willingness to substitute across goods vs. over time.
If individuals are relatively indifferent between consuming good 1 or 2, the lack of availability of
good 2 will lead to an offsetting increase in expenditure on good 1, limiting the increase in
unemployment in sector 1. Alternatively, the lack of availability of good 2 may lead individuals
to want to consume even less of good 1; the two goods, in this sense, are complements—and
vice versa. The fact that the effective price of good 1 has temporarily increased means that
individuals not only don’t want to consume good 1 now, but also good 2. If intertemporal
substitution is easy, individuals may decide to postpone their consumption of good 2 until next
period. Thus, the constrained derivative of demand for good one with respect to 𝜏𝜏 is more
negative than the unconstrained demand, and the pandemic tax may even lead to a decrease in
𝜕𝜕𝐷𝐷2

the demand for good 2 ( 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 < 0).

In this section, we assume that the savings rate is fixed 16, taking up the implications of a change
in the savings rate in the next. (As we will argue in the next two sections, there are even
reasons to suspect that the demand for good 1 will fall even more than equation (9), which
takes the level of savings as fixed, would suggest.)
It is obvious that given that constraint (1) is binding, there will be unemployment, with the
greater the “pandemic” tax, the greater the level of unemployment.

where 𝜂𝜂 is the elasticity of demand with respect to the income of workers in sector 1 17:
Implying that 𝑝𝑝𝐷𝐷1 + 𝐷𝐷2 = (1 − 𝑠𝑠1 )𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 + (1 − 𝑠𝑠2 )𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 . (Implicitly, in this formulation, we assume that all of
profits are saved. It is easy to consider the more general case. We also implicitly assume that there may be
“balance of payments” deficits/surpluses across sectors, i.e. that sector 1 may be spending more on sector 2 than
sector 2 spends on sector 1, generating cross-sector debts.)
17
We can derive a more precise expression for 𝜂𝜂. Demand for good 1 can be decomposed into the demand from
workers in sector 1 and workers in sector 2 (assume for the moment that none of profits is spent on good 1): 𝐷𝐷1 =
𝐷𝐷11 + 𝐷𝐷21 . Then 𝜂𝜂 = 𝛼𝛼𝜂𝜂1 + (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜂𝜂2 , where 𝛼𝛼 is the share of total demand coming from workers in sector 1.

supply, inducing further increases in employment. It follows that

The pandemic tax reduces employment in sector 1. Since employment in sector 2 is
constrained, this means that the pandemic tax gives rise to unemployment.

Diagrammatic exposition
Figure 1A shows a standard demand and supply curve with the initial (pre-pandemic)
equilibrium {𝐿𝐿1 , 𝑝𝑝}. Covid-19 raises the price of the good to 𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏. Figure 1B decomposes the
demand for sector 1 into two components, an essential component (buying groceries), with a
low elasticity of demand, and an inessential component (like restaurant meals), with a high
elasticity of demand. Thus, the pandemic tax eliminates all inessential “services” but leaves the
essential services.
The rest of the analysis traces out the consequence. In the short-short run, {𝑝𝑝, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 } are fixed,
and Figure 2 shows demand and supply as a function of employment in sector 1. The supply
curve (giving 𝑌𝑌1 as a function of 𝐸𝐸1 ) is, of course, just the production function, 𝐻𝐻1 . As
employment increases, the demand for good 1 increases. There is a natural stability condition
that 𝜀𝜀 > 𝜂𝜂 ; otherwise an increase in employment in sector 1 would give rise to an increase in
demand for sector 1 so large that it would more than justify that increase—i.e., it would lead to
an increase in excess demand for good 1.
The initial pre-pandemic equilibrium shows the initial equilibrium, {𝐿𝐿1 , 𝑌𝑌1 }. The pandemic tax
shifts the demand curve down, resulting in an equilibrium employment at point 𝐶𝐶, 𝐸𝐸1∗ < 𝐿𝐿1 ,
with the number of unemployed equaling 𝐿𝐿1 − 𝐸𝐸1∗ . 19 If employment in sector 1 had remained
constant, the employment effect of the decrease in demand induced by the pandemic tax
As Figure 2 below illustrates, we assume 𝜀𝜀 > 𝜂𝜂.

Post-pandemic, with wages and prices fixed in the short run, the pandemic shifts down the
demand for sector 1, and results in a lower level of employment and output. The inability to
fulfill one’s demand for good 2 will result in some shifting in demand from good 2 to good 1; but
the offsetting increase in demand does not suffice to restore the economy to full employment.

Partial labor mobility and macroeconomic externalities
This analysis is little changed if labor can move from sector 1 to sector 2, but at a cost, 𝑧𝑧, if
wages and prices are fixed. The reason is simple: at the initial equilibrium, 𝑤𝑤2 = 𝑝𝑝2 𝐻𝐻2 ’(𝐿𝐿2 ), so
𝑤𝑤2 + 𝑧𝑧 > 𝑝𝑝2 𝐻𝐻2 ’(𝐿𝐿2 ) for all 𝐿𝐿2 > 𝐿𝐿2𝑜𝑜 , the initial value of 𝐿𝐿2 . It doesn’t pay firms in sector 2 to
pay the mobility (training) costs.

But hiring additional workers in sector 2 gives rise to a macroeconomic externality: it generates
an increase in employment in sector 1 of

desirable. 20

Figure 3 shows how the increase in employment in sector 2 shifts the demand curve for sector
1 up, increasing employment in sector 1.

An increase in employment in sector 2 or in unemployment insurance increases employment in
sector 1.

The magnitude of the increase in employment in sector 1 is likely to be smaller than given by equation (13),
which does not include the indirect effect of the relaxation of the constraint on purchases of good 2 on the
demand for good 1. It is straightforward to include this indirect effect in the calculus.

Other Policy shifts
It is easy to see how the provision of unemployment insurance not only ameliorates the
suffering of the unemployed, but actually reduces unemployment. Let 𝑏𝑏 be the unemployment
benefit provided to unemployed workers. Equation (9) now reads
(14a) 𝐻𝐻1 (𝐸𝐸1 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 �𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 + 𝑏𝑏(𝐿𝐿1 − 𝐸𝐸1 ), 𝑤𝑤2 𝐿𝐿2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 )�

and it is immediate that an increase in 𝑏𝑏 increases the level of employment in sector 1. 21

Increased government expenditures may alleviate the consequences of even a supply side
perturbation

While this economic downturn was caused by what might be viewed as a supply side
perturbation, a demand side intervention—an increase in government spending—may still
reduce unemployment. This is seen most clearly if the government expenditures are focused
on sector 1:
(14b) 𝐻𝐻1 (𝐸𝐸1 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 �𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐿𝐿2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 )� + 𝐺𝐺1,

where it is immediate that an increase in 𝐺𝐺1 increases 𝐸𝐸1 . 22 It is worth noting, however, that
even an increase in government demand for good 2 will normally increase employment in
sector 1, because the supply of sector 2 goods available for consumers will be reduced. For
instance, assuming that the government demand for good 2 gets priority, the equilibrium
condition for sector 1 is now
(14c) 𝐻𝐻1 (𝐸𝐸1 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐿𝐿2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ) − 𝐺𝐺2 )

And so long as a decreased availability of good 2 (in the supply constrained equilibrium) results
in an increased demand for good 1, an increase in 𝐺𝐺2 will result in an increase in 𝐸𝐸1 .
This analysis abstracts from the impact of the deficits used to finance the unemployment insurance (or the taxes
now or in the future that might have to be levied). Ricardian equivalence would suggest that these impacts fully
offset the direct effect; but both theory and empirical evidence suggest otherwise. In particular, so long as some
of the individuals who receive the unemployment benefits are credit constrained, the increase in consumption of
these individuals more than offsets the decrease in consumption of those who reduce their consumption as a
result of the anticipation of future taxes. See Stiglitz (1988). There is evidence that many of the recipients of
unemployment insurance and cash payments are credit constrained. See Chetty et al 2020.
22
Again, we have, of course, assumed that the savings (consumption) rate is fixed, and we have not discussed the
implications of the increased indebtedness and/or taxes associated with the increase in 𝐺𝐺. See the discussion in
the previous footnote. But even if there is some increase in the savings rate, in an economy with fixed wages and
prices, an increase in government purchases of good 2 crowds in private purchases of good 1. Whether this effect
is enough to offset the increase in the savings effect depends both on the strength of the Ricardian effect and the
degree of substitutability between the two goods.
21

Wage flexibility may make matters worse
There is some evidence (Chetty et al. 2020) that not only incomes but wages have decreased in
response to Covid-19. Standard New Keynesian DSGE blame wage rigidities for the failure of
markets—the persistence of unemployment. But the Fisher-Greenwald-Stiglitz strand of New
Keynesian economics (Fisher, 1933, Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1993b, 2003) has emphasized that
the immediate effect of the decrease in wages is a decrease in aggregate demand, exacerbating
unemployment. 23 This income effect outweighs any “substitution” effect encouraging greater
use of labor in production. This is especially so given the “putty clay” nature of production
technologies 24—exploiting the full substitution possibilities of technology takes time.
In this model, these effects can be seen to play out, as the lowering of wages, in either or both
sectors (keeping prices fixed), shifts down the demand curve for good 1, leading to a lower level
of 𝐸𝐸1 and a higher level of unemployment. 25

While there might exist a full employment equilibrium if all wages and prices were fully flexible
at all dates (and presumably states of nature) 26, this is another example of the theory of the
second best: allowing some to be flexible (here wages this period) may make matters worse.
Besides, and more importantly, decentralized adjustment processes with flexible wages and
prices may not converge smoothly to the full employment equilibrium: the short run response
may be disequilibrating. (Guzman and Stiglitz (2020)).
2. 2. Unconstrained production of sector 2

More interesting is the case where the imposition of the pandemic tax reduces employment in
sector 1, and this so reduces the demand for sector 2 goods that employment in both sectors is
reduced, i.e. where as 𝜏𝜏 increases both 𝐸𝐸1 and 𝐸𝐸2 fall, so that neither of the constraints (1) are
binding. This can easily happen. Assume, for instance, that the only individuals buying sector 2
goods are workers in sector 1. Then the reduction in the demand for sector 1 goods and
therefore of employment in sector 1 translates into a reduction in the demand for sector 2
goods. If this income effect exceeds the substitution effect—i.e. the willingness of individuals
to substitute sector 2 goods for the now costly sector 1 goods—then the demand for sector 2

They focus on balance sheet effects, but there may also be real interest rate effects if prices move in tandem
with wages, as discussed later in this paper.
24
See the discussion in fn. 5 above.
25
This can be seen in a standard demand and supply for labor diagram. At the initial value of 𝑤𝑤1 , the demand
for labor falls short of the supply (noting in particular because of the assumption of no labor mobility, the supply of
labor is fixed at 𝐿𝐿1 . If the demand curve were unaffected by the lowering of wages, lowering of 𝑤𝑤1 would (if prices
fell in tandem, as discussed further below in section 2.4) lead to an increase in employment. But as wages fall, the
demand curve for sector 1 goods falls, and if it falls enough, the level of employment can actually fall.
26
In section 4, we describe the full employment equilibrium given the rigidities in the reallocation of real
resources.
23

goods will decrease. And this decrease in the demand for sector 2 goods amplifies the initial
decrease in the demand for sector 1 goods.
Formally, (7) gives E1 as a function of E2 and (8) gives E2 as a function of E1:
(15a) 𝐸𝐸1 = 𝜃𝜃1 (𝐸𝐸2 ; 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 , 𝑝𝑝)

(15b) 𝐸𝐸2 = 𝜃𝜃 2 (𝐸𝐸2 ; 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 , 𝑝𝑝).

We can then solve equations (15) and (16) simultaneously for 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 as a function of 𝜏𝜏, for
given {𝑝𝑝, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 }:
(16a) 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = φi (𝜏𝜏; 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖 , 𝑝𝑝)

We can find conditions under which
(16b)

𝑑𝑑φ𝑖𝑖

�

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝜏𝜏=0

< 0.

Figure 4 illustrates such a case. The initial equilibrium entails 𝜏𝜏 = 0, 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 . As Figure 4
illustrates, the pandemic tax shifts the first curve (“Sector 1 equilibrium”) to the left (for any 𝐸𝐸2 ,
the equilibrium employment in the first sector is smaller), and the second curve up (sector 2
equilibrium) (for any 𝐸𝐸 1 , the equilibrium level of 𝐸𝐸 2 has increased.) The magnitude of the
respective shifts depends on the substitutability/complementarity between the products as
well as the degree of intertemporal substitution, as we have commented on before. At the
initial equilibrium, with 𝜏𝜏 = 0, the curves intersect at the initial levels of employment in the
two sectors.

Figure 4 The pandemic tax can result in unemployment in both sectors.
In the case depicted, the new level of employment in both sectors is below the initial level. The
decrease in employment in the first sector so depresses demand in the second sector that even
though there is some substitutability, overall employment in the second sector is decreased.
This is the case of true Keynesian unemployment, of the kind discussed in the earlier work of
Delli Gatti et al. (2012a,b). In this case, the mobility constraints are, in a sense, not binding:
even though unemployment may be greater in sector 1 than in sector 2, the marginal
(unemployed) individual in sector 2 would have little motive to shift, because he would just join
the ranks of the unemployed in sector 1. 27
Policy: Unemployment benefits and mobility subsidies
Providing unemployment benefits, say to the directly affected sector, increases the equilibrium
level of employment 𝐸𝐸1 , for each value of 𝐸𝐸 2 ; but also increases the equilibrium level of
employment 𝐸𝐸 2 for each level of 𝐸𝐸1 , and results in a higher level of equilibrium employment in
both sectors, with potentially large welfare gains. Of course, eventually, such policies
encounter the constraints (1), in particular the constraint that 𝐸𝐸2 ≤ 𝐿𝐿2 , in which case we shift
into the model discussed in the previous section.

There will, in general, exist a full employment equilibrium if labor is fully mobile. There may thus exist two (or
more) possible equilibria; the “bad” equilibrium reflects a coordination failure. Alternatively, without mobility,
there may not exist a full employment equilibrium, for that equilibrium might entail an increase in employment in
sector 2, which is precluded by assumption. A third alternative is that there exists an equilibrium with less
unemployment, e.g. where there is only unemployment in the first sector, as described earlier.
27

16

At that point, the mobility constraints do become binding, and as we argued there, because of
the macroeconomic externality, it pays for the government to help finance the shift of labor
from sector 1 to sector 2: active labor market policies become desirable.
Policy: Wage flexibility and increased government expenditures
Our earlier analysis showing that wage flexibility may matters worse applies with even greater
strength: the equilibrium curves for both sectors shift “down.” Each shift alone would lead to
more unemployment; the two together have a compounding effect. So too, increases in
government expenditures, whether in sector 1 or 2, increase employment in both sectors.
2.3. A closer look at the two regimes
Figure 5 depicts the case where the pandemic tax leads (ignoring the mobility constraints (1)) to
a higher value of 𝐸𝐸 2 and a lower value of 𝐸𝐸 1 , point 𝐴𝐴 depicted in the figure. Because of the
mobility constraint, 𝐸𝐸 2 = 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 {𝜃𝜃 2 , 𝐿𝐿2 }, suggesting an equilibrium at point 𝐵𝐵. But, as we have
noted, the inability of individuals to fulfill their desired level of consumption of good 2 (because
of the production constraints) shifts up the demand for good 1 at every level of 𝐸𝐸 2 , resulting in
the equilibrium being a point such as 𝐶𝐶.

Figure 5. Pandemic Tax can result in unemployment in one or both sectors. In the case depicted
here, the equilibrium, after taking account of the shift in the demand from sector 2 to sector 1
as a result of the binding supply constraint, is at 𝐶𝐶, with unemployment only in sector 1
(measured by the distance along the horizontal axis between 𝐶𝐶 and 𝐷𝐷). But if the upward shift
�1 and 𝐸𝐸
�2 (between the two dashed lines)—the new
of 𝐸𝐸1 is small, the intersection between 𝐸𝐸
equilibrium—entails unemployment in both sectors.
17

It is apparent from Figure 5 that if the shift up of the curve giving employment in sector 2 as a
function of 𝐸𝐸1 , is small relative to the shift to the left (effectively down) of the curve giving
employment in sector 1 at each level of 𝐸𝐸 2 , then the pandemic equilibrium will entail a lower
level of 𝐸𝐸 2 than 𝐿𝐿2 , i.e. neither employment constraint will be binding; there will be
unemployment in both sectors.
2.4. Flexible prices
The analysis so far has assumed fixed wages and prices. Assume now that the pandemic sector
is highly competitive and so prices are set so prices are on the firms’ supply curve, so long as
the labor constraint is not binding. Then we replace equation (7) and (8) with
(17a) 𝑌𝑌1 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑤𝑤1 ) = 𝐷𝐷1 �𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐿𝐿2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 )�
(17b) 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ) = 𝐷𝐷2 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ))

where

(17c) 𝐸𝐸1 (𝑝𝑝) = 𝐻𝐻 −1 [𝑌𝑌1 (𝑝𝑝, 𝑤𝑤1 )]

The equilibrium is now described by two equations in the two unknowns {𝑝𝑝, 𝐸𝐸2 }, as illustrated
in Figure 6. The analysis proceeds much as before. 28

2.5. Health vs. Macroeconomic externalities and structural Keynesian policies
Underlying the analysis so far is the presumption that we wish to reduce unemployment. But
what if there are significant health externalities associated with either consumption or
production in sector 1, which are obviously not fully reflected in individuals’ decisions about
consumption or work? Assume, for instance, that increased consumption of sector 1 has an
external health cost of 𝜒𝜒(𝑌𝑌1 ) which individuals do not take into account in making their
demand decisions. We focus on the Keynesian equilibrium where 𝑌𝑌1 is just a function of 𝐸𝐸1 ,
and so for convenience we express the external health cost just as a function of employment in
that sector. (This formulation allows the health externality to arise either in the process of
consumption or production.) Assume the social welfare function can be expressed simply as a
function of 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝐸𝐸2 , and 𝜒𝜒: 𝑊𝑊(𝐸𝐸1 , 𝐸𝐸2 , 𝜒𝜒), with 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 a function of some policy 𝑃𝑃: 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 (𝑃𝑃). Then,
obviously, optimal policy may entail less than full employment, if

At 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 = 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 , i.e. at full employment. It is preferable to have some unemployment than to bear
the costs of the greater spreading of disease that would result from full employment.
But there are policies that can simultaneously help mitigate the disease and its consequences
and bolster employment. Assume, for instance, there are public expenditures on sector 2
goods, that reduce the private or social costs of the pandemic, i.e. a category of expenditure,
𝐺𝐺2𝐻𝐻 such that 𝜏𝜏(𝐺𝐺2𝐻𝐻 ) with 𝜏𝜏’ < 0 and 𝜒𝜒(𝐺𝐺2𝐻𝐻 ) with 𝜒𝜒𝐺𝐺2𝐻𝐻 < 0, e.g. expenditures on protective
gear and tests. It is clear that such expenditures improve welfare on all accounts, increasing 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖
and private and public health, and such expenditures should be expanded (if they exist) until
the economy reaches full employment.
Similarly, we noted earlier that there is a macroeconomic externality associated with moving
individuals from sector 1 to sector 2 when sector 2’s employment constraint is binding. For the
government to absorb those moving costs may be welfare improving, provided that the
external health costs are not too large.
In our earlier work, we identified these kinds of expenditures as structural Keynesian
expenditures, i.e. there is an underlying set of structural problems (here, associated with the
pandemic and the constraints on labor mobility), and expenditures which simultaneously
address the structural problem and stimulate aggregate demand do “double duty.” In the
aftermath of the Great Depression, expenditures that facilitated the movement of workers
from the rural to the urban sector and trained them for jobs in that sector provided a structural
Keynesian stimulus.
19

3. Precautionary behavior and intertemporal substitution
The analysis so far can be criticized as being overly simplistic, a black box analysis, simply taking
the demand curves as given, not deriving them from first principles, a derivation based on the
usual intertemporal maximization problem. 29 This has been deliberate. As we have suggested
in the introduction, dominating the problem of intertemporal substitution on which standard
analyses focus is that of risk and precautionary behavior. Individuals simply don’t know how
long and severe the pandemic and its economic aftermath will be. Though under restrictive
conditions, one can formulate their decision problem as if they were maximizing expected
utility with subjective probabilities, those subjective probabilities have no bases in relative
frequencies, and it is problematic whether, confronting the pandemic, that model provides a
good description of behavior. What is clear is that upper income individuals (and firms, which
we have omitted from the analysis) respond by building up large cash balances, as they
confront the risk of an extended period of unemployment with limited assistance from
government. 30 This precautionary behavior, increasing savings, shifts down the demand curves
for both commodities, resulting in a new equilibrium with Keynesian unemployment, i.e. there
is a greater presumption that, without government assistance, the situation will be that
We described our analysis as taking savings as given. But we could just as easily analyze the equilibrium where
savings is endogenous. We can construct a two-period model where, without uncertainty, we can fully derive all
demand functions in the standard way, taking into account mobility constraints and the associated supply
constraints. Assume the second period (the end of the analysis) wages and prices are fully flexible and resources
are fully mobile, so that we have a standard general equilibrium allocation, conditional on the “wealth” that has
been transferred from the first period to the second. Assume individuals have rational expectations about that
equilibrium. Then for any price vector describing that equilibrium, and for the given wage and price vector
describing the initial period, individuals optimally allocate their consumption over the two periods and two goods,
simultaneously deciding on how much wealth to convey to the second period. The model of the previous section
can be thought of as “solving” this full equilibrium. The analysis of this section then explores the consequences of
the increase in savings as a result of risk.
30
I should be clear that not everyone behaves in this way. There are two important exceptions, both of which can
be easily accommodated within the framework of this paper. The first are individuals who are credit constrained,
who would like to consume more than they do today, and so consume all of their income. Providing more income
to them (e.g. temporary benefits in the midst of the pandemic) leads them to consume more. There is evidence
that this describes a large fraction of lower income individuals in the United States (Chetty et al 2020), a point that
had been emphasized in earlier macro-models emphasizing the importance of distribution (e.g. the models of
Pasinetti (1962) or Kaldor (1955), where workers, to a first approximation, consume all of their income); in earlier
macro models emphasizing the importance of credit and equity constraints (Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1990, 2003;
Weiss and Stiglitz, 1992; Hubbard, 1998), and in the more recent HANK models (Kaplan et al. 2018).
29

The second group are those that may be so depressed by the life prospects under the pandemic that they take the
attitude “live while you can.” For these individuals too consumption is only limited by today’s income (and
possibly what they can borrow.)
In both cases, the presence of large numbers of individuals for whom consumption equals income implies (a)
multipliers are larger than otherwise would be the case and (b) income effects may be more important than
substitution effects.

20

depicted in Figure 4. The policies described earlier then become applicable. In particular,
because of the marked differences in marginal propensities to consume, the expansionary
effect of assistance provided to those who are credit constrained will be markedly higher than
for assistance provided to upper income individuals. (It is important to recognize that the
increase in precautionary behavior results, at least in part, in an increase in demand for nonproduced assets, like land and money, not for produced assets, for reasons explained below.)
But there is one further set of policies which becomes particularly relevant: reducing the
extent of risk aversion. We discuss these policies below.
3.1. Market Failures and the potential for government intervention
In standard economics, there is an exercise that one normally performs at this point: Why
don’t markets provide the optimal amount of insurance? Why is there a need for government?
After all, if individuals are risk averse, won’t private markets have an incentive to provide
unemployment insurance? Where’s the market failure? Such exercises made sense forty years
ago when there was still a presumption (in some circles) that markets were efficient. But
advances in economics should have made clear that there should be a presumption that
markets are not efficient (See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986, 1988), Arnott, Greenwald, and
Stiglitz (1994), Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis, 1986) , especially in the presence of imperfect
and asymmetric information—obviously central to the concerns here—and there are a wealth
of reasons for government intervention. Still, it may be useful to rehearse the standard
arguments, since they may, at the same time, provide some guidance for what government
policies may be most appropriate.
Incomplete risk markets and government interventions
Before presenting these arguments, we should give perhaps the most compelling reason for
government intervention: markets have often not provided insurance products—like annuities
at reasonable prices, health insurance, especially for the aged and without restrictions on preexisting conditions, and unemployment insurance—and the government has to been able to
provide insurance that people value enormously; and even when the private sector provides
similar products to those of the public, public insurance typically, even today, has provisions
addressing key contingencies, such as inflation. Moreover, the private sector can’t provide for
intergenerational risk sharing. Publicly provided social insurance—even with imperfectly
designed programs—have enormously increased societal well-being. They have, in particular,
enhanced individuals’ security. 31

31

For a more extensive discussion of some aspects of government’s advantage in risk-bearing, see Stiglitz (1993).

21

As we look at pandemic-risk from our perspective emphasizing the incompleteness of markets,
the absence of pandemic insurance is perhaps not surprising. Nor, given the past behavior of
insurance companies, is their attempt to weasel out of the coverage they have provided for
business interruption insurance—one of the few pandemic related risks that seemed to be
covered, absent the ambiguous fine print which the insurance companies now want to be read
in their favor.
While the absence of insurance coverage for events that have not been well-contemplated—
like the current lock-downs associated with Covid-19—is perhaps understandable, it is worth
noting that now, after the risks are amply clear, markets are still not stepping up to pool and
share the risks going forward. While there may not be well-defined probabilities for each of the
relevant risks that will determine the course of disease and its economic impact (e.g. around
the discovery of vaccines and therapeutics), in standard economic models that should not be
required for the establishment of markets to share and pool risks. Yet, these events, of
enormous consequence for the lives of everyone, remain largely uninsurable.
Explaining the absence of insurance markets
Central to the Guzman-Stiglitz analysis was the assumption of incomplete contract: one simply
cannot specify, with any clarity—and especially with sufficient clarity to have an enforceable
contract—insurance contracts providing for every possible relevant contingency, especially with
the differentiated treatment that each circumstance “deserves,” and would have in a world
with complete contracting. Because insurers know that there are risks beyond those that they
can easily contemplate, typical insurance contracts have provisions limiting coverage to
specified risks (those not specified are not covered) and explicitly limiting coverage for
important risks, the magnitude of which are hard to ascertain ex ante, and especially those
which may simultaneously affect many individuals—i.e. have macroeconomic significance.
Thus, as we noted, most insurance companies are claiming that their coverage of business
interruption insurance does not extend to the interruptions associated with the pandemic.
Moreover, even when there is coverage, when there are large macroeconomic disturbances
(i.e. events which simultaneously affect large numbers of households and firms), private
insurance firms often don’t have the financial wherewithal to deliver the benefits promised.
This is an example of the macroeconomic inconsistencies emphasized by Guzman and Stiglitz
(2020): events like crises and pandemics entail promises not being fulfilled. Rationally,
individuals (except those living in the world of DSGE models) know this, but they do not and
cannot know what will happen when these contracts are broken. They do not and cannot know
the outcome of bankruptcy proceedings, or the extent to which Courts will recognize
arguments like force majeure or necessity, providing an “out” for those not fulfilling contract
terms.
22

In addition, there are the standard limitations on insurance markets presented by adverse
selection and adverse incentives.
Advantages of government vs. private sector
While the government faces similar problems arising from information asymmetries and the
impossibility of specifying complete contracts, there are telling differences, both in instruments
and objectives. For instance, the government is concerned about macro-economic
externalities; the private sector is not; and as Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986) pointed out,
economies with imperfect information and incomplete contracts/markets are rife with microand macro-externalities. The government has the power to proscribe and incentivize actions
(e.g. through taxes and regulatory policies) that are not available to private actors. And the
governments’ ability to redistribute ex post—after it sees the roll of the dice—allows it to
mitigate social risks in ways that the private sector simply can’t. Obviously, knowing that there
is going to be some ex post redistribution has incentive effects, but they are mixed in nature: on
the one hand, it may lead to more entrepreneurial risk taking and mitigate macroeconomic
externalities such as those that arise from excessive precautionary savings; on the other hand,
it may encourage more corelated risk taking, and it may, in some circumstances, lead to
excessive risk taking (the infamous moral hazard problem.)
In the absence of insurance for critical contingencies—in this case, for “states of nature”
depending on the pace and evolution of the disease and the development of vaccinations and
therapeutics, the provision of recovery measures by the US and other governments, and the
effectiveness of those measures in restoring the (relevant) economies (sectors) to full
employment—individuals will tend to save more and in forms which have more “flexibility,” e.g.
in liquid assets, whose value may be perceived to be uncorrelated, or even better, negatively
correlated, with possible adverse outcomes. It is the uncertainties, as we have said, that will
dominate behavior, more than intertemporal smoothing.
3.2. Intertemporal substitution vs. Risk
The contrast in perspectives can be seen most clearly in the case where the pandemic is known
to disappear next period. 32 Then, in a two-period model, we can think of any individual as
having a utility function of the form (in the obvious notation)
(18)

32

𝑈𝑈 = 𝑈𝑈(𝐶𝐶11 , 𝐶𝐶12 , 𝐶𝐶21 , 𝐶𝐶22 )

We discuss this case further in the next section.

23

Standard macro-economic models make the empirically dubious assumption of time
separability. But just as a thought experiment, consider the case where individuals only care
about their life-time consumptions of the two goods, i.e. the utility function takes the form
(19)

𝑈𝑈 = 𝑈𝑈(𝐶𝐶11 + 𝐶𝐶12 , 𝐶𝐶21 + 𝐶𝐶22 )

Then knowing that there is a tax on consuming good 1 only in the first period, if goods prices
don’t adjust in an offsetting way, they would consume good 1 only in period 2 and good 2 in
period 1. In the absence of adjustment costs, and say with a linear production function, the
economy would remain at full employment and the pandemic (as modeled here—apart from its
direct effect on health) would have no economic effect, though it would have a large effect on
intertemporal patterns of consumption.
More generally, with knowledge that the disease will “just disappear,” there is no need for
increasing precautionary behavior: all one has to do is to do as well as one can in rearranging
patterns of consumption over time.
Real rigidities (costs of reallocating resources) and nominal rigidities (difficulties in adjustments
in prices and wages) can give rise to the kinds of short run costs that we have delineated in this
paper. Indeed, the presence of these rigidities, taking them as given, gives rise to a
macroeconomic externality associated with savings: each individual believes, for instance, that
by postponing consumption of good 1 to next period, he can avoid paying the “pandemic tax,”
but as they all do this, employment in the first sector, and possibly in both sectors, decreases.
Society as a whole pays a cost in terms of underutilization of resources.
Simple Analytics
In short, the demand functions used earlier (equations (7) and (8)) need to be extended not just
to incorporate possibly constraints on purchases of good 2 but also an increase in precautionary
savings to reflect the uncertainty posed by pandemic and the possible desire to postpone
consumption until a period when the pandemic tax is not being levied. We thus write the
demand (this period) for good 𝑖𝑖 as
(20)

𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐿𝐿2 ); 𝑠𝑠(𝜏𝜏, 𝜎𝜎))

where we have assumed that the savings rate is a function of the magnitude of the pandemic
tax and the uncertainty associated with the future, 𝜎𝜎. The effect of an increase in 𝑠𝑠 can be
easily traced out in either of the two cases: In the case where there is full employment in the
second sector, the increase in uncertainty shifts down 𝐷𝐷1 , leading to a lower level of 𝐸𝐸1 . In the
case where there is unemployment in both sectors, the increase in uncertainty shifts down both
𝐷𝐷1 and 𝐷𝐷2 , leading to decreased employment in both sectors.
24

3.3. Why it matters
Whether one prioritizes the analysis of risk and uncertainty makes a difference, because it
naturally draws one’s attention to different kinds of policy measures.
Misplaced emphasis on wage rigidities
When it is assumed that the only important deviations from a perfectly competitive equilibrium
model are wage (and price) rigidities, we are naturally led to the policy recommendation: if we
could only make wages flexible enough, we could restore full employment; and by making
wages more flexible—weakening unions or reducing severance pay—welfare is improved.
We’ve already shown that making wages more flexible—but not fully flexible—could in fact
worsen the problem: a dynamic theory of the second best. Guzman and Stiglitz argued the
problem of unemployment was more one of excessive volatility in aggregate demand than of
insufficient wage flexibility; that is, reasonable institutional reforms, like the installation of
automatic stabilizers and capital controls, are more likely to enhance stability and full
employment than weakening unions or job protections.
Misplaced emphasis on intertemporal substitution
So too, the focus on intertemporal substitution—individuals maximizing their intertemporal
utility, with lifetime budget constraints—naturally puts a focus on intertemporal prices, interest
rates. The hope was that the lowering of interest rates by monetary authorities would induce
higher levels of aggregate demand now, restoring full employment. With substitution and
income effects moving in offsetting ways, and with large numbers of individuals being target
savers—saving for retirement, to buy a house, or to put their children through school—for
whom lowering of interest rates leads to lower levels of consumption, it was never obvious why
so many economists thought this was likely to be a power instrument for stimulating the
economy, especially in a deep downturn. Though the limits of monetary policy have now once
again (as they were in the earlier days of Keynesian thought) become part of conventional
wisdom, it is not (as the standard models suggest) because of the “zero lower bound.” There
are ways, using time profiles of sales taxes and investment credits, to change intertemporal
prices, even in the presence of the ZLB. Rather, it is simply that changes in the real interest rate
in the relevant range do not have the required impact on aggregate demand. Large enough
changes (along the lines described below) might. 33

Monetary policy can, of course, work through other channels, e.g. on credit availability or through exchange rate
effects. Part of the lack of ability of monetary policy to stimulate the economy in the 2008 crisis was related to the
failure to increase lending to those parts of the economy (SME’s) facing credit constraints. Changes in exchange
rates are, of course, “beggar thy neighbor” policies, improving aggregate demand in one country at the expense of
that in others.

3.4. Policies to encourage consumption (or investment) in the presence of risk
Recognizing that at least part of the fundamental problem is risk and the failure of risk
markets—and as a result, in a fundamental sense, individual risk may well exceed societal risk -draws attention to what policy can do to reduce risk, thereby reducing the demand for
precautionary balances and increasing consumption today.
Policies which strengthen unemployment insurance (or other welfare support programs) and
making a commitment that such expanded programs will be available so long as the
unemployment rates remain elevated reduce individuals’ needs for precautionary balances.
(Thus, the refusal, as this paper goes to print, of the Republicans in the US to support such a
commitment is counterproductive. 34)
There are measures that could directly reduce the risk confronting those making investment
decisions (either of consumer durables or productive assets): state-contingent (income
contingent) loans, where the amounts to be paid back next period (and possibly over the life of
the asset) depend on the state of the pandemic and/or the income (profits) of the individual
(firm). These can be thought of as “partial Arrow Debreu securities,” socializing some of the
risk associated with these expenditures in ways that markets have failed to do so, and doing so
with terms that recognize the macroeconomic externalities associated with these
investments. 35
The standard analysis rests on confounding two matters that should be kept separate. First,
time and risk. The weakness in consumption today is not the result of too high an interest rate,
but of the absence of insurance against some potentially very adverse circumstances in the
future. The presence of macroeconomic externalities means, moreover, that individual and
social incentives are not well aligned. We’ve described a couple of ways that public policy may
address directly the risk problem.

The claim that the benefits are excessive, and are resulting in a labor shortage, seems dubious. As we have
explained, the decrease in jobs in say airlines, restaurants, and other contact service sectors arises from the
pandemic “tax.” Having more people search for jobs that don’t exist doesn’t increase the level of employment.
Many individuals are reluctant to work given the risks that that imposes on them, for which they are not
adequately compensated. If markets worked well, employers could still find workers, even if there were generous
unemployment benefits, but, of course, they would have to pay higher wages. Cross state evidence (based on
differences in unemployment benefits) corroborates this perspective. See Altonji et al. 2020.
35
One can think of these loans as making a commitment to provide additional liquidity in the event, say, that the
unemployment remains high next period. But the provision of such liquidity at such a time would obviously not be
inflationary: by definition, it is a time of insufficient aggregate demand. One can design contracts where there is
little or no moral hazard: the individual or firm would still have to repay the loan at some later date, when the
economy recovered.
34

26

There are also ways that government policy may more directly encourage consumption or
investment today, in a more targeted and effective manner than an overall change in the
interest rate. Some countries have already implemented such programs: a “sale” on
consumption or investment goods today, encouraging consumption and investment today. This
can be done through time dated consumption coupons, or through a temporary investment tax
credit or a temporary lowering of the sales tax on, say, cars. Such measures may be desirable if
one believes that there is irrational pessimism which is preventing consumption today. The
problem with the pandemic is that risk perceptions may be rational. The increase in
consumption this period comes at the expense of lower cash balances, and if, next period, the
risk remains unabated, individuals may be even more anxious, and double down on building up
their precautionary balances. That is why, given that the underlying problem is one of risk,
measures which socialize this risk seem better targeted.
There is a second confusion: between the holding of precautionary balances with produced vs.
non-produced goods. The standard models have at most one non-produced good, money. In
general, there is a form of Say’s Law in action: when individuals decide to consume more at a
later date, they want there to be the productive capacity to produce that good, and so
investment increases in tandem. But if individuals take today’s income and hold it in the form
of land or money, there is no offsetting increase in the demand for goods produced today.
Supply does not create its own demand.
One of the reasons for the limited efficacy of the vast increase in liquidity in 2008, or in 2020, is
that so little of it went into the demand for produced goods and so much of it went into
holdings of money and of pre-existing assets, giving rise to increases in asset prices. Again,
government policies can, at least at the margin, shift the demand away from non-produced
assets to those currently being produced, e.g. increasing capital gains taxes on a mark to mark
basis, for investments in pre-existing assets without provisions for the deductibility of losses.
Such a policy would change the relative price of a pre-existing asset and a new asset,
encouraging the production of new capital goods.
3.5. Credit constraints and precautionary balances
An important feature of the economy is that different individuals are in different circumstances.
A significant fraction has no cash balances and is living paycheck to paycheck. For these
individuals, a reduction in income has to translate into a reduction in expenditures. There is
little or no scope for precautionary balances. For these, the savings rate is zero. But there is
another group who are not living quite on the edge, who are saving, and who respond to the
pandemic by increasing precautionary balances. The data we cited in the introduction
concerning the average savings rate shows that a large portion of the population (weighted by
income) was not credit constrained, and did not become credit constrained by the pandemic—
though this was almost surely partly because of the large government programs.
27

(The national income data may not fully reflect what is happening to household balance sheets.
With the stay on evictions, large fractions of the population have not paid their rents. Their
cash balances have gone up—but so too have their liabilities.)
The fact that some individuals are credit constrained and others not needs to be reflected in
our model for the demand for goods and services. Instead of (21) we write
(21a) 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐿𝐿2 ); 𝑠𝑠(𝜏𝜏, 𝜎𝜎), 𝜆𝜆)

where 𝜆𝜆 is the fraction of the population that is credit constrained.

There is one important policy implication of this formulation: if we can target money towards
credit constrained individuals, the multiplier effect will be larger than untargeted money, much
of which will simply go into increased precautionary balances. Chetty et al. show, in fact, that
spending increased significantly upon the receipt of government checks in April, 2020.
So too, even the stay on evictions can not only alleviate the immediate suffering resulting from
the pandemic, but also stimulate the economy: in effect, it loosens the credit constraints facing
individuals. But such stays have more ambiguous effects in the intermediate run (discussed
briefly below in section 4): household balance sheets weaken (in a way which is not the case
with direct payments), meaning that the post pandemic recovery will be more difficult. To
mitigate these effects, what is needed is not just a stay, but a temporary rent/interest rate
reduction. After all, had the pandemic been anticipated, and had there been more complete
contracts, there would likely have been provisions calling for a reduction in rents and interest
payments during the pandemic.
3.6. Investment
So far, we have ignored investment. It is easy to introduce investment, 𝐼𝐼. It is natural to think
of investment as related to sector 2, and for simplicity, we limit it to that. Then we replace (8)
by
(22)

𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ) = 𝐷𝐷2 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ) + 𝐼𝐼

So long as 𝐼𝐼 is fixed and unaffected by the pandemic, the analysis is unchanged. But 𝐼𝐼 will be
affected, through several channels: (a) Lower expected output next period in either sector 1 or
sector 2 (as a result of the continuation of the pandemic) will depress investment today 36; (b)
Lower profits in either sector with cash/credit/equity constrained firms will result in lower
investment; (c) Increased uncertainty about the future will result in lower investment; and (d)
This effect can be incorporated formally into the model by assuming that 𝐼𝐼 = 𝐼𝐼(𝑌𝑌1 , 𝑌𝑌 2 ; 𝑟𝑟) where 𝑟𝑟 is the interest
rate. In the Keynesian equilibrium described in earlier sections, 𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖 = 𝐻𝐻(𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 ). This increases the macroeconomic
externality from sector 1 to sector 2 and vice versa, and implies a larger decrease in both 𝐸𝐸1 and 𝐸𝐸2.

36

28

risk averse banks will be less willing to lend (and possibly less able to lend, if there are
significant defaults), and will change the terms of lending to make borrowing less attractive.37 It
is thus possible that post-pandemic, the level of 𝐸𝐸2 corresponding to any level of 𝐸𝐸1 may
actually be lower, in which case it is unambiguously the case that both 𝐸𝐸1 and 𝐸𝐸2 will have
decreased. While monetary policy may attempt to counteract these forces, with interest rates
already near zero, the ability of it to do so (if it ever could) is limited. Moreover, the increase in
uncertainty may lower the elasticity of investment with respect to interest rate: at no interest
rate (in the relevant range) will investment be large enough to restore full employment.
Note that our analysis here follows the standard Keynesian approach in emphasizing that the
savings and investment decisions are made independent of each other (unlike in much of the
contemporary macroeconomics literature, where firms don’t even exist as independent
institutions). In the background, there is one further distinction, perhaps not sufficiently
emphasized by Keynes: the decision to save may create a demand for a non-produced asset,
like land. (See the discussion below in section 5).
3.7. Open economy
So far, we’ve modeled a closed economy. The analysis can be easily modified to incorporate
trade. We do so in a very reduced form way. For simplicity, we assume only sector 2 is traded,
and net exports 𝑋𝑋 are a function of 𝑝𝑝, 𝜏𝜏, the exchange rate 𝑒𝑒 and the constraint 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐿𝐿2 ), if it is
binding: 𝑋𝑋 = 𝑋𝑋(𝑝𝑝, 𝜏𝜏, 𝑒𝑒; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐿𝐿2 )). Net exports must equal capital inflows, 𝐹𝐹, which depend on
variables like the interest rates in the two countries, and beliefs about the rate of change of the
exchange rate, which in turn are affected by beliefs about the future evolution of the economy.
In this pandemic (as in other crises), initially there was a flight to safety—capital flows into the
US, leading to an appreciation of the currency. With interest rates close to zero, monetary
policies play a less important role. As time goes on, it becomes clearer how the pandemic will
affect different countries. With the US performing more poorly than many other countries, it is
perhaps not surprising that the exchange rate has declined. We formalize the exchange rate
determination by
(23)

𝑋𝑋�𝑝𝑝, 𝜏𝜏, 𝑒𝑒; 𝐻𝐻2 (𝐿𝐿2 )� = 𝐹𝐹(𝑒𝑒, 𝜏𝜏; 𝛺𝛺)

where 𝛺𝛺 represents beliefs about the future (next period), and in particular about next period’s
exchange rate.
Now, the goods market equilibrium in sector 2 becomes
(24)

𝐻𝐻2 (𝐸𝐸2 ) = 𝐷𝐷2 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐸𝐸1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐸𝐸2 ) + 𝐼𝐼 + 𝑋𝑋

There are still other channels: if prices and wages are flexible, there will be further adverse effects on balance
sheets, given that firms’ debts are not indexed. The fall in wages and prices increases the real interest rate, and
this may discourage investment.

37

29

(7), (23) and (24) are then solved simultaneously for {𝐸𝐸1 , 𝐸𝐸2 , 𝑒𝑒}. Adding, for instance,
government expenditure to the demand for good 2 or a universal cash payment or
unemployment benefits (as earlier), we can ascertain impacts on the level of employment in
both sectors. For a country like the United States which imports much of its durable
manufacturing goods, the concern is that any untargeted spending support will go to increase
the demand for imports (given the unattractiveness of non-essential services in the midst of the
pandemic). 38 If capital inflows are relatively inelastic, the major impact will be on the exchange
rate, not on aggregate demand. More generally, net imports will increase from what they
otherwise would have been, but not as much as they would have done in the absence of the
exchange rate adjustment; and the increased net imports will partially offset the direct
expansionary effect of the government program. 39 This suggests that the time-dated targeted
service vouchers described earlier may be a more effective way of supporting the economy.
3.9. Covid-19 and labor supply
This paper has focused on the impacts of Covid-19 on demand; but it also can have supply side
effects. Many workers are reluctant to work in jobs in which they may be exposed to Covid-19.
We could model that as a tax on working in the first sector during Covid-19, with the labor
supply schedule given by 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠 = 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠 (𝑤𝑤1 + 𝜏𝜏̂ ), 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠 ′ < 0, 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠 (𝑤𝑤1𝑜𝑜 ) = 𝐿𝐿, where 𝑤𝑤1𝑜𝑜 is the first sector
wage in the initial equilibrium. In the initial cases considered here, where wages are rigid, the
tax leads to a reduction in the supply of labor to the first sector. This reduces the potential
supply in the first sector.
There are then two cases: (a) that where the initial fall in demand is greater than the fall in
supply. The analysis follows exactly as in earlier sections. Some of those “unemployed” in the
first sector have left voluntarily and are looking for jobs at the going wage in the second sector.
(b) that where the initial fall in supply is greater than the fall in demand. Then there is still a
macroeconomic externality from the first sector to the second, now driven by the supply side.
The reduced income in the first sector still leads to reduced demand in the second sector. The
supply constraint in the first sector shifts up the demand function in the second sector (just as
the supply constraint in the second sector affected the demand for first sector goods.) Thus, in
the case where there is Keynesian unemployment in the second sector, the magnitude of that
unemployment is less than would have been the case with the same level of first sector
employment.
Subsequent adjustments, however, are markedly different in this case than in that studied
earlier. Now, there is upward pressure on wages in the first sector, rather than downward
Jamie Galbraith has emphasized this in his analysis of the Covid-19 response.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the trade balance in goods went from -$60 billion in February to -$81 billion in
July 2020, a one third increase, and at an annual rate representing some 1% of GDP. (The balance of trade in
goods and services worsened even more, from -$37 billion to -$64 billion.)

38

pressures. As wages rise, demand in both sectors increase. But there is still downward
pressure on wages in the second sector. Depending on the relative pace of adjustment in the
two sectors, demand may increase or decrease. If it decreases, it has no effect on the first
sector, since output in that sector is supply constrained. Eventually, of course, the demand
constraint will become binding, and then we merge into case (a). Meanwhile, the fall in wages
in sector 2 exacerbates the deficiency of aggregate demand in that sector, lowering
employment and output.
On the other hand, if aggregate demand increases, whether the discrepancy between
aggregate demand and supply in the first sector increases or decreases depends on the
magnitudes of the demand and supply effects, which in turn depend on the income elasticity of
the demand for good 1 vs. the labor supply elasticity. Either is possible. At the same time, the
increase in aggregate demand in sector 2 increases employment there, which has a macroeconomic externality of increasing demand in sector 1.
Matters can be more complicated with income demand elasticities of workers in the two
sectors possibly differing. We leave the various possible patterns as exercises for the reader.
There are two important points raised by the analysis: (a) as in our earlier analysis,
decentralized adjustments may not be equilibrating; but (b) at least in sector 1 we should see
upward wage pressures rather than downward. Early evidence from a number of studies
(including Cajner et al. 2020) shows significant wage declines, and especially in the most
affected sectors, suggesting that the labor supply constraint is not binding. 40
4. Short-short run, short run, intermediate run vs. Long Run Pandemic Analysis
The analysis in section 2 focused on the first period equilibrium, assuming that savings were
fixed. In section 3, we discussed how savings might be affected, both through intertemporal
substitution and as a result of risk. It is clear how an increase or decrease in savings alters the
equilibrium analysis of section 2.

If labor supply responses to covid-19 were driving the economic downturn, as David Vines has emphasized, one
could use a one-sector model to depict the macroeconomic consequences. It is, in effect, a temporary downward
shift in the labor supply curve, which has an income effect (life time income is lower) which is smoothed out
through shifting consumption/spending forward in time—so the decrease in demand might be expected to be less
than the decrease in supply were it not for the decrease in investment (assuming prices remain unchanged.) But
the decrease in output over the duration of the pandemic means (if the pandemic lasts long enough) that there
will be a decrease in investment. Moreover, if monetary policy remains unchanged, the increased uncertainty
leads to a shift in demand towards precautionary assets—money and land—and away from physical capital goods,
depressing investment still further. If, as we described above, the labor shortage was the predominating effect in
the short run, the upward pressure on wages might lead monetary authorities following inflation targeting policies
to increase interest rates, exacerbating the shortfall in aggregate demand.
40

31

Here, we focus on four additional aspects. The impacts in the short and medium term depend
critically on whether covid-19 will pass, and (as we noted in the last section) on the uncertainty
about when that might happen. Even if Covid-19 were to be a permanent (or long lasting)
feature of life, short run impacts can differ from long run because of adjustment costs.
We have assumed that in the short run, wages and prices are fixed. We have noted that in
practice, they adjust, but such adjustments do not necessarily bring the economy closer to full
employment. Below, we describe the full employment equilibrium that would emerge if wages
and prices were fully flexible, and somehow, the economy could find itself in this full
employment equilibrium.
More interesting though than this hypothetical is a look at the short run dynamics likely to
unfold as the economy emerges from the pandemic, with the devastation that it brings to the
economy: hysteresis affects abound.
4.1. Some complexities in consumption patterns: Adaptation
Indeed, interpreting on-going data on consumption—trying to make inferences from that data
for what patterns of consumption might look like in the future—is difficult, partly because of
the uncertainties that we have just discussed, and partly because of the large adjustments to
which the pandemic has given rise. “Adjustment” effects should not be confounded with
longer range effects. For instance, the pandemic has, as our model emphasized, given rise to
changed patterns of activities. New activities may require investments, either by firms or
consumers. Individuals no longer go to gyms, and so their demand for bicycles and home
exercise equipment has soared. In urban centers like New York, where the subway may be
viewed as unsafe and where there is demand for open spaces where one can enjoy the
outdoors without masks, there is an increase in demand for cars. Many homes have had to
upgrade the quality of their wi-fi. But these are one-time investments that mask the overall
concern about increasing precautionary balances. (There has, in fact, been a huge increase in
such balances on the part of both corporates and households.) Of course, there are still a large
number of individuals who live on the edge. These are individuals for whom the changes in
current income incorporated in our model are likely to be particularly significant; and for whom
government subsidies are likely to give rise to corresponding large increases in spending.
4.2. Contrasting Implications of a short-term vs a longer term pandemic
The analysis changes in several ways if individuals know that the pandemic is only a short-term
phenomenon. First, the willingness to expend resources on investments for patterns of
behavior which are assumed to be only temporary will be limited. Thus, the kinds of
expenditures described in the previous subsection will be more limited.
32

Secondly, the impact of the pandemic on consumption in the short run may be different,
possibly even more adverse. As we have modeled it, the tax becomes a tax on consumption of
sector 1 goods only in the first period. As we have already noted, this will distort consumption
not only towards sector 2 in the first period, but also towards the second period. One can avoid
the tax simply by delaying eating in restaurants to the next period. In this case, savings in the
first period will increase. Of course, in a full equilibrium model, individuals should know that if,
say, there are capacity constraints next period (i.e. the economy was already at full
employment in the second period), then they can’t enjoy more consumption then unless there
is more investment today. Presumably, the intertemporal prices would adjust (assuming full
price flexibility) and/or monetary policy would lower the interest rate, to encourage
consumption today. But, as we noted in the previous section, the required degree of price
flexibility and the required adjustments in interest rates are unlikely to be forthcoming.
Besides, under plausible assumptions, the lowering of interest rates will lead to increased
savings—individuals have to save more to provide for the retirement, to make the down
payment on their house, or to pay for their children’s education. Given the high level of
uncertainty, and pervasive credit and equity rationing, firms may not increase investment,
certainly not enough to ensure full employment in the first period.
In a dynamic disequilibrium model, however, individuals may not fully understand all the
constraints—they may formulate dynamically inconsistent plans. Hence, they do set aside
more today for future consumption. And even more so if there is uncertainty about the
duration of the pandemic and its economic impacts.41
4.3. The long run: a new full employment equilibrium?
In the long run, one might assume that all wages and prices are adjustable, and all factors are
mobile. But such assumptions are far from innocuous. 42 Nominal wages and prices might
adjust, but in a decentralized economy, they might adjust in such a way as to give rise to
rigidities in relative wages and prices, i.e. relative wages and prices that do not ensure full
employment. (Solow and Stiglitz (1968)). Even if eventually wages and prices exhibited full
employment, that could be a long, long time. And in economies with asymmetries in
information—all economies—there can be rigidities in real wages and real interest rates.

It is straightforward to model optimal consumption behavior in a world in which there is a Poisson probability
that the pandemic disappears every period. See the Appendix for a simple two period model of savings under
uncertainty, using standard subjective utility analysis. That model, however, almost surely does not adequately
capture fully the extent to which the pandemic engenders precautionary behavior, discussed further in section 3. .
Kreps (1979, 1992) provides a better framework for analyzing choice in the presence of the kinds of uncertainties
posed by the pandemic
42
Moreover, in the time scale of such adjustments, other “state” variables are likely to change—not just the state
of the pandemic, but capital stocks, labor supplies, and firm net worth.
41

33

Still, even in the presence of the labor market rigidities restricting labor mobility, we can
determine the wages and prices which would give rise to full employment. The supply of labor
in each sector is fixed (at 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ), so full employment simply requires the demand for good 𝑖𝑖 to be
equal to the full employment supply, in the absence of rationing:
(25)

𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖 (𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝 + 𝜏𝜏, 𝑤𝑤1 𝐿𝐿1 , 𝑤𝑤2 𝐿𝐿2 )

Equilibrium requires that firms in the two sectors want to hire, at the going wages and prices,
the labor which is available in the sector
(26)
(27)

′

𝑤𝑤2 = 𝐻𝐻 2 (𝐿𝐿2 )
′

𝑤𝑤1 = 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻1 (𝐿𝐿1 )

(26) implies that 𝑤𝑤2 is unchanged, (27) that 𝑤𝑤1 /𝑝𝑝 is unchanged, so that (25) then becomes a
single equation in a single unknown, 𝑝𝑝. A sufficiently large fall in the price of the good
adversely affected by the pandemic (good 1), with a correspondingly large fall in the wage of
workers in that sector may restore full employment. 43 Of course, this sets in motion, over the
longer term, a movement of workers from sector 1 to sector 2, and the restoration of a new
general equilibrium, reflecting the new “technology” whereby there is a pandemic cost to the
consumption of good 1. (It also will set in motion forces for the development of technologies
where good 1 can be consumed without bearing as high a pandemic cost.)
The various policy instruments that we have described (reducing risk, increasing unemployment
benefits, moving individuals from sector 1 to sector 2) reduce the magnitude of the reduction
of 𝑝𝑝 required to attain full employment, and if full employment is not attained, the extent of
unemployment.
4.4. Post-pandemic dynamics and macroeconomic externalities

The analysis has been, for the most part (with the exception of the previous subsection), very
short run. We have described some of the forces at play that may or may not reduce
unemployment in the short run. For instance, the presence of unemployment in sector 1 may
lead to lower wages, and this may actually exacerbate the unemployment problem; while the
movement of workers from sector 1 to sector 2 may, under some circumstances, reduce the
unemployment rate (though not in others). We have described the full employment
equilibrium, but whether such an equilibrium will be quickly attained without government
intervention is not clear. What is clear is that there may be large macroeconomic externalities,
so that government intervention will, in general, be desirable.
This is not quite accurate. Even at a price of zero, consumption of good 1 may be so unattractive at least for
some individuals that demand is less than what would be supplied with full employment.
43

34

There are many aspects of macroeconomic externalities and the dynamics of adjustment that
have been explored in the broader macroeconomic literature and are relevant for the analysis
here, which has put particular emphasis on incomplete contracts and markets.
In particular, the economic downturn in sector 1, and possibly in sector 2, has adverse
implications for the balance sheets of firms and workers in those sectors. Following along the
lines of analysis of Greenwald-Stiglitz (1993a), there will be an increase in the risk of
bankruptcy, with the loss of organizational and informational capital that results, not just from
the increased risk associated with the pandemic but also because of these adverse effects on
balance sheet. Increased risk, worsened balance sheets, and depleted organizational and
informational capital in turn, will lead to decreased investment and even have adverse effects
on firms’ willingness to produce. Combined with weaker household balance sheets, both
aggregate supply and demand shift down, lowering employment and output, with effects which
persist even after the pandemic has been controlled. That is, even if it were known that the
pandemic would “just disappear” after one period, the effects of the pandemic could live on
after. Government interventions during the pandemic to mitigate the magnitude of the
downturn would reduce these adverse effects and thus would yield benefits not just during the
pandemic, but also in its aftermath.
So too, if the pandemic makes labor-intensive production in certain sectors less attractive, and
there is uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic, and firms respond by installing robots,
then once the pandemic is put under control, the demand for labor will be lower than it
otherwise would have been, and inequality is likely to be higher. If there are (perhaps costly)
government interventions that can simultaneously limit the spread of the disease even with
labor-intensive technologies, those interventions may be socially desirable.
Pandemics quintessentially entail externalities, so there is no presumption that market
responses to a pandemic are Pareto efficient. And the macroeconomic consequences of
decentralized responses to the pandemic, in the presence of incomplete contracts and markets
in a disequilibrium world with learning, naturally give rise to large macroeconomic externalities,
and again there is a presumption that well-designed interventions are welfare enhancing, even
when the government has no more information about the course of the evolution of the
pandemic than the agents within the economy.
4.5. A one sector model
We have argued that central to understanding the impact of Covid-19 on the economy is
understanding the differential impacts on different sectors and different groups (low income
workers who are credit constrained vs. high income workers who engage in precautionary
savings). It is useful as a thought experiment to ask, what the impact would be in a one sector
economy, where Covid-19 either makes consumption today (and for the duration of the
pandemic) less attractive, or makes work less attractive. This kind of perturbation can easily be
handled within standard DSGE models, as a temporary shift in the functions describing the
35

utility of consumption or the disutility of work. We do not go through the formalities, but
discuss the qualitative results.
If there were only one sector, and say the pandemic exercised its effect by making work less
attractive at any wage (since it increases the exposure to Covid-19), then a temporary
pandemic would, at a fixed wage and intertemporal prices, reduce permanent income, and thus
consumption, less than today’s aggregate supply; while employment would decrease, there
would be no unemployment, and indeed there would be labor shortages and upward pressure
on wages, contrary (as we noted) to what has been observed.
If there were only one sector, and the pandemic exercised its effects by making consumption
less attractive at any price, then, at fixed wages and prices, including interest rates, the
pandemic would lead to a reduction in demand and employment. There would be no
Keynesian multiplier, since lifetime income, which determines consumption in the standard
model, would be largely unaffected. One might have thought that, given that the marginal
benefits to consuming more today are lower, it makes sense that individuals work less today.
But especially with more general utility functions, individuals might want to smooth work over
time, so that there is no close link between changes in the marginal utility of consumption at
any date and the desired level of work at that date. 44 Hence, individuals might not want to
change their level of work much, even though they want to change their consumption levels a
great deal. There could be considerable unemployment. It could take large adjustments in
wages and prices (including intertemporal prices) to restore full employment.
As we noted earlier, standard monetary policy adjustments in those cases where the dominant
effect of the pandemic is through discouraging labor supply would discourage consumption and
investment today, exacerbating the unemployment. Conversely, in those cases where the
effects come through consumption, and there is an increase in unemployment, the lowering of
interest rates as inflationary pressures are reduced (deflationary pressures increased) will
increase aggregate demand and serve to restore the economy to full employment. But
whether the policy response is fast enough and the behavioral response to that policy response
is large enough (or even in the right direction) to counteract the downward pressures, which
result directly from the disinflation/deflation discussed in section 3.6, is ambiguous.
5. Dynamic Disequilibrium Models with Noise
In an earlier paper, we presented an alternative approach for the study of macroeconomics to
the standard Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that has become
fashionable in economics, which we referred to as a Dynamic Disequilibrium Model with
Randomness. (Guzman and Stiglitz, forthcoming).
Obviously, one can construct utility functions for which consumption today and leisure today are either
complements or substitutes, i.e. the drop in consumption today because of the pandemic leads to an increase or
decrease in labor supply. In the latter case, there could again be a labor shortage (at the given set of wages and
prices). In the former case, the increase in the unemployment rate is even greater.

Nothing could better illustrate the differences in approaches than the disturbance associated
with Covid-19, generating the largest economic collapse in memory. In its nature, it is closer to
the kinds of shocks envisaged in the standard DSGE models—an exogenous “technology”
shock—than to the demand/financial shock of either the Great Recession, the 1991 downturn,
or even the Great Depression. But clearly, though there was ample warning of the threat of a
pandemic and an awareness of the possible cost—under President Obama, the White House
had set up within the National Security Council an office for Pandemic preparedness—and a
few scholars had attempted to estimate the magnitude of the risks (suggesting that they might
be comparable to that associated with global warming (Fan et al. 2016)), none of the standard
DSGE models incorporated the risks into their analyses, nor did many individuals, enterprises,
and financial institutions. The pandemic was not just the realization of one of the many
possible states of nature, all anticipated, with well defined (subjective) probabilities
corresponding to the objective frequencies describing the occurrence of this kind of pandemic.
Once it became clear that we were in the midst of a pandemic, there was still no “common
knowledge”: perceptions about the evolution of the disease and its economic impact differed
markedly within the population and across countries. There was an enormous amount of
learning. This learning affected behavior—and changes in behavior affected in turn the
behavior of the economic system.45
It was clear in this crisis, and in that of 2008, that the cognitive dissonance that marks DSGE
modelling, whereby individuals believe, or at least act as if, there economy is always on an
equilibrium trajectory (in which the transversality condition is satisfied), even in those moments
immediately after it is clear that they were not on an equilibrium trajectory, and have to
recalibrate—and this is so no matter how often such disturbances occur—did not describe well
the unfolding events: the economy did not immediately go onto a new equilibrium trajectory.
There was a real process of groping—of trying to understand what had happened and what
would unfold, through an interaction between policymakers, the political system, and other
agents in the economy and the political and social system. In the case of the 2008 Great
Recession, as was true in the Great Depression, it would be almost a decade before the
economy returned to something approaching full employment. In 2008, there was not
common knowledge concerning the shocks that gave rise to the crisis or the impacts of the
policy responses. 46 Writing now, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, we simply don’t know
the course of the disease; and there are large disagreements about the desirability, and even
consequences, of alternative policies.

It is important to realize that as learning occurs, the behavior of the economic system changes, and that there
are no general theorems concerning the efficiency or stability of alternative learning processes. Indeed, Dosi et al.
(2020) and Siniskaya and Tesfatsion (2015) have recently demonstrated that what might seem “better” learning
processes—using more sophisticated estimation processes compared to more myopic expectations—actually
result in poorer systemic performance. Catullo, Gallegat and Russo (2020) have shown that while more
sophisticated learning systems may improve firm performance, macroeconomic performance may be worsened.
46
Eighty years after the Great Depression, there is still not a fully agreed understanding of that event.
45

37

Six critical features defined our approach and differentiated it from DSGE, all of which are
illustrated by the pandemic.
First, and most importantly, we argued that, in the absence of futures markets for all states of
nature going infinitely far into the future, the world was such that individuals were typically not
on long run equilibrium paths satisfying the transversality conditions at all dates and all states.
That in turn implied that there would be moments—typically revealed at times of critical
macroeconomic dysfunction, like financial crises—in which macroeconomic inconsistencies
became apparent, where individuals’ plans were not, and in many cases, could not, be fulfilled.
These were moments that often were not fully anticipated, and in many cases not even
contemplated. Certainly, the details of how the relevant events would play out was not
thought through. Accordingly, not only was there not a complete set of Arrow-Debreu
securities, contracts themselves were incomplete in a fundamental way.
A defining feature of the pandemic is that many contracts are being broken, with follow on
effects that are still unknown. And as we noted, the few insurance contracts covering some of
the consequences (business interruption insurance) are being contested.
Thirdly, these moments are points of time in which individuals learn a great deal about the
world—about the economy and the political system which governs it. The rational expectations
model—in which all states are anticipated, and life is but a playing out of the rolls of the dice
that nature affords—simply does not apply. There are large changes in views about what is
possible and what is likely. No one before the pandemic would have contemplated that there
were circumstances, outside of war, where governments would be willing to undertake deficits
of the magnitude that we have seen. Few had contemplated downturns of the magnitude and
rapidity that have been experienced.
Fourthly, the momentary equilibrium was typically associated with at least some markets not
clearing, most importantly the labor market: unemployment was real, and not just caused by
nominal wage rigidities. Nominal wages might be flexible, though obviously, in a sense, not
flexible enough. Most importantly, as we have shown, the theory of the second best applies:
increased flexibility might make matters worse.
In our earlier paper, we had argued that what really needed to be explained was not the
inflexibility of wages but the volatility of aggregate demand: were aggregate demand more
stable, there was sufficient wage flexibility that the economy might have been able to remain at
or near full employment. Though it is no surprise that the pandemic has given rise to a very
large change in aggregate demand, there is still something to explain: why intertemporal
substitution didn’t do a better job in stabilizing aggregate demand. Part of the explanation, we
have suggested, lies in the increased precautionary behavior that is central to our
disequilibrium analysis. This precautionary behavior exacerbated the economic downturn.

38

Fifth, the adjustment processes, the responses of economic agents to this learning, does not
put them onto a new dynamic equilibrium path. Decentralized adjustments could move them
further away either from a momentary equilibrium in which all markets clear and/or a dynamic
equilibrium in which transversality conditions are satisfied in all states and dates. There was no
presumption that a decentralized market economy was either efficient or stable, and there
were government interventions that were welfare improving.
Finally, because there are alternative stores of value—money or land—if individuals save more,
the demand for “future” consumption does not translate into an increased demand for
produced goods today (capital goods). It can lead instead to an increase demand for money or
land or gold or other non-produced goods, leading (as Keynes suggested) to a deficiency of
aggregate demand today, a deficiency which is not easily or quickly remedied by decentralized
adjustments in prices or even by government adjusting interest rates. These non-produced
goods may be particularly desirable at times of great uncertainty, where the very nature of the
future economy is so much up in the air, for they provide more “flexibility,” i.e. they are likely
to have value regardless of what emerges (See Kreps, 1979, 1992). By contrast, the value of
any specific capital good—whether an airplane or a machine—may be far more uncertain.
The critique of the DSGE model, of course, is not just that the assumptions which go into it are
implausible, but are directed at its ability to explain and predict, and to provide guidance on
policies to prevent and respond to fluctuations. DSGE models have systematically failed to
predict the large macroeconomic perturbations, like the 2008 crisis, and to provide adequate
policy responses to the events which have such monumental consequences. In most of the
cases, the disturbances are endogenous—rather than the exogenous technology shocks that
are the source of the perturbations in DSGE models. Our analysis suggests that they are equally
unsuited for thinking about responses to the pandemic, which is, in some ways, more like the
technology shocks upon which the models focus. It is, for instance, exogenous. Today,
individuals and firms are not thinking about the sequence of consumption and investments that
ensure that they are on an equilibrium path with full macroeconomic consistency, with all
transversality conditions satisfied. They are thinking about the unknown and unknowable
course of the disease and the economy, and how to protect themselves against what may lie
ahead. While individuals and firms do not just live in the moment—they think forward—they
respond to current signals, aware of the limits of their knowledge. Government interventions
that are based on this more realistic model of behavior are likely to prove more successful than
those based on alternative hypotheses.
6. Concluding Comments
In this paper, we have modeled Covid-19 as an unanticipated technology shock that adversely
affects the demand for good 1—it acts as a tax on its consumption—for a period of unknown
duration, with unknown and uncertain effects on the economy, with unknown and uncertain
policy responses—and unknown and uncertain responses of the agents within the economy to
those policy responses. But given the sluggish adjustment of prices and wages (and possibly
39

expectations about future values of those variables), and the real rigidities in the economy, the
technology shock can give rise to Keynesian unemployment, where government Keynesian
policy responses—such as increased government expenditures and unemployment subsidies—
can help restore full employment. Under some circumstances, Keynesian structural policies—
expenditures aimed at reallocating labor—can be helpful. Second best economics prevails:
trying to make labor markets more flexible may make matters worse.
While we have focused on a pandemic shock affecting the consumption of certain sectors
(here, sector 1), we have shown how the analysis can easily be extended as well to a pandemic
shock affecting certain production technologies, e.g. those employing workers working in close
quarters.
So too, as we have suggested, the analysis can be extended to models with multiple sectors,
where some are adversely (positively) affected not just by the income and substitution effects
upon which we have focused, but also by cross elasticities, including those arising from binding
demand and supply constraints (the inability to obtain certain goods; the inability to “sell” as
much labor as one would like.)
There has never been an event like this in the era of modern industrialization, so, even if we
understood more about the virus, it is natural that we don’t know about how economic agents
and the economic system respond. There is much learning. Not surprisingly, we have learned
that there are markedly different views about how economic agents and the economic system
respond, and markedly different views of how, under these unique circumstances, agents and
the system will respond to different policy interventions. The world is not well-described by
common knowledge, and any model which makes the assumptions of rational expectations,
common knowledge, and the economy being on an equilibrium trajectory, is not likely to
provide a good basis either for predicting what will happen or for designing optimal policy
responses. The lockdowns were designed not only to reduce the imposition of externalities by
individuals on each other, to reduce the spread of the disease directly during the period of the
lockdown, but also to induce changes in behavior. But the extent to which they were able to
induce changes in behavior was greatly affected by the information, or disinformation, to which
individuals were exposed. Understanding how policies affect beliefs and behavior is central to
understanding the efficacy of alternative policies.
Hopefully, this paper has not only provided some insights into the evolution of the economy in
response to the pandemic and the design of appropriate policy responses, but also has made a
convincing case that the approach to macroeconomics explored by Guzman and Stiglitz, “The
Dynamic Disequilibrium Model with Randomness”, with its emphasis on learning,
disequilibrium, and a decentralized adjustment process provides a useful framework for dealing
with those large and not fully understood events that seem to so frequently interrupt the
smooth workings of capitalist economies, whether they are debt or financial crises, pandemics,
or terrorist attacks.
40

In such circumstances, attention has to be drawn to the key determinants of behavior at those
moments, with attention to policies which might be the most effective in restoring the
economy quickly to full employment. We have stressed that unemployment largely arises from
the fact that the immediate effect on aggregate demand is felt faster than the impacts of the
sluggish response of wages and prices, and because those responses are done in an
uncoordinated, decentralized manner, they may well be disequilibrating. Thus, the focus of
attention should be on ameliorating the adverse shock to aggregate demand, if possible, in
ways that address some of the structural problems that have given rise to the underlying
unemployment. Well targeted policies are likely to be more effective, and increase social
welfare, more than broad based “bazookas” such as that unleashed by the CARES Act in the US.
Policies which address extremes of precautionary behavior, including the demand for money,
land, and other non-produced assets, may be particularly effective at such moments of extreme
uncertainty; we have described several such policies. In particular, we have emphasized the
importance of providing assurances that supportive policies will be continued as long as the
underlying weaknesses in the economy persist. Even if monetary policy were not at its limits,
times of extreme uncertainty are times where the interest elasticity of consumption and
investment are likely to be very low, so that monetary policy is not likely to be very effective.
There will have to be a reliance on fiscal policy. At such times, fiscal policy may be particularly
effective: if Ricardian effects are ever relevant, they are especially unlikely to be relevant at
these junctures, where individuals are focused on the here and now, not on long run
transversality conditions, and where credit constraints are likely to be especially relevant for
large portions of households and firms. The wide divergence of behavioral responses between
those households who are credit constrained and those that are not suggests that targeting
assistance to the former will have a much larger multiplier. Targeting expenditures that address
the underlying problem—protective gear and tests that help prevent the spread of the
disease—have triple benefits: direct benefits in containing the disease, structural benefits in
reducing what we have modeled as the “pandemic tax,” and Keynesian benefits in reducing
unemployment.

Appendix: Determination of precautionary balances
The standard model of savings under uncertainty has savings chosen to maximize
𝑉𝑉 (𝑞𝑞1 , (1 − 𝑠𝑠)𝑌𝑌1 ) + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿 (𝑞𝑞2 , 𝑠𝑠𝑌𝑌1 (1 + 𝑟𝑟) + 𝑌𝑌2 ),

s.t. 𝑠𝑠 ≥ 0, where 𝑉𝑉 is the indirect utility function, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 income in period 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 is the price vector
in period 𝐼𝐼, including the pandemic tax, i.e. 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 = 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 + 𝜏𝜏. We focus on the fact that 𝑌𝑌2 and 𝑞𝑞2
are unknown—the individual doesn’t know the extent of economic devastation of the
pandemic nor its duration.
Standard models without uncertainty focus on the smoothing of consumption. Here we focus
on the effects of uncertainty. Consider, for instance, an individual who believes that he will be
unemployed next period. Assume, for simplicity that 𝑟𝑟 = 0 and that the pandemic will
continue to next period, so 𝑞𝑞1 = 𝑞𝑞2 .47 Then 𝑠𝑠 = ½. Of course, if he were to believe that there
was a zero probability of unemployment, then 𝑠𝑠 = 0. The uncertainty associated with 𝑌𝑌2
implies an increase in 𝑠𝑠 provided 𝑉𝑉𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌𝑌 > 0.

Notice that the properties of the utility function that determine savings in the presence of
uncertainty are different from those that are critical in models without risk. Parameterizations
like constant elasticity utility functions which might provide a good approximation for behavior
in normal times may be inappropriate in the presence of an extreme event like a pandemic,
where individuals may be more concerned about large downside deviations. 48
More realistically, because individuals have no basis for judging what are reasonable probability
distributions for 𝑌𝑌2 , they may focus on worst-case or near worst-case scenarios, which, as we
have just shown, can lead to very high savings rates.

47

Alternatively, assume 𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 = 0. 𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞 = −𝐶𝐶1 𝑉𝑉𝑌𝑌 , so −

𝑌𝑌𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞
𝑉𝑉𝑞𝑞

= −𝑅𝑅 + 𝜇𝜇, where 𝑅𝑅 is the elasticity of marginal utility and

𝜇𝜇 is the income elasticity of commodity 1. Note that in this simple model, if there is a probability that the
pandemic will end next period, so in effect 𝑞𝑞2 < 𝑞𝑞1, then savings will be higher if 𝑅𝑅 > 𝜇𝜇.
48
There is another more subtle critique of constant elasticity utility functions. In general, the elasticity of marginal
utility is not invariant to relative price, as illustrated by the calculations in the previous footnote. More generally,
utility functions exhibit constant elasticity at all prices (within a range) only under stringent conditions which are
empirically not satisfied. See Stiglitz (1969).
