    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops an open-economy model of the business cycle. The\nnominal prices in the model are flexible and monetary nonneutrality is\ndeveloped using information confusion about the sources of disturbances to\ndemand coupled with differential persistence of demand shocks. Firms use\ninventories to smooth their production, and consumers follow a stochastic\npermanent income expenditure function. The major implication of the model\nis that unperceived monetary disturbances improve the terms of trade and\nincrease real output in contrast to sticky price models in which the terms\nof trade deteriorates. This implication of the model is examined\nempirically.\n\n",
