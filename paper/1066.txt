Modeling Deviations from Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

ABSTRACT

The volatility of the exchange rate under floating rates can be
interpreted in terms of approaches that allow for short term price rigidity as
well as in terms of models that consider the magnification effect of new

information. This paper combines the two approaches into a unified framework,
where the degree to which prices are rigid is determined endogenously. It is
shown that the variance of percentage deviations from ppp has an upper bound,
and that the relationship between the variance of deviations from ppp and the
aggregate variability is not inonotonic. Allowing for a short—run Phillips
curve with optimal indexation, it is also demonstrated that a higher price
flexibility will reduce deviations from ppp and output volatility.

I. Introduction
Recent experience with floating exchange rates has renewed interest in

the doctrine of purchasing power parity (referred to as ppp henceforth). This
doctrine hypothesizes that adjustment of the exchange rate should follow
national inflation differentials closely if the law of one price is to

hold.' To the degree that ppp holds, it provides a link between goods prices
in different countries which, together with interest rate parity, enables us
to understand the behavior of floating exchange rates by means of elegant

modeling. Recently, however, a growing number of studies have provided ample
evidence of deviations from ppp..2 These findings cast doubt on the ability of
models that rely on the doctrine of ppp to provide a satisfactory explanation

for the behavior of exchange rates. As a partial solution, recent studies
have added extra shock, which describes deviations from ppp generated by a

random process. The purpose of this paper is to model deviations from ppp in
a way that is more satisfactory and is consistent with the asset approach to
exchange rate determination , as well as with sluggish adjustment in the goods
market.

There are two different interpretations for deviations from ppp: first,

as deviations from the law of one price; next, as an index number problem. In
other words, even if the law of one price holds for each good, the difference
in consumption basket across countries implies that changes in relative prices

will result in deviations from ppp. Clearly, the first interpretation causes
more headaches in explaining the international transmission. This paper will
concentrate on this interpretation and, in order to simplify, will assume a

one—good world. Hence ppp and the law of one price are synonyms.
In a recent paper Flood (1981) demonstrated that the volatility of the
exchange rate can be interpreted in terms of models that allow for short term

—1-—

price rigidity (Dornbusch (1976)) as well as in terms of models that consider
the magnification effect of new information (Frenkel (1976) and Mussa

(1976)). This paper combines the two approaches into a unified framework,
where the degree to which prices are rigid is determined endogenously. The
benefit of such an approach is in deriving the dependence of the variance of

deviations from ppp on the underlying structure of the economy. It is shown
that the variance of percentage deviations from ppp has an upper bound, and
that the relationship between the variance of deviation from ppp and the

aggregate variability is not necessarily monotonic. These results seem to be
applicable for deviations from parity conditions between any two related

markets and not only for the problem of ppp. The analysis also demonstrates
that deviations from ppp and volatility of exchange rates are closely related

phenomena. They are explained by combining the two alternative approaches
analyzed by Flood; thus, both approaches should be viewed as complementary and

as reinforcing each other. Allowing for a short—run Phillips curve, it is
also demonstrated that with optimal indexation a higher price flexibilty will
reduce output volatility.

A study by Mussa (1981) suggests that the frequency of price adjustment

should be related negatively to the cost of price changes. Comparing the
price behavior of assets traded in a well organized market to the price
behavior of goods, it is safe to claim that the cost of price adjustment for

the former is lower than for the latter. The exchange rate functions
simultaneously as the price of an asset (foreign currency) and as a component

of the price of traded goods. The two prices are different because the
behavior of the spot exchange rate resembles that of assets prices, whereas

the behavior of the price.of traded goods resembles that of goods prices. To
capture this situation, let us model it in a discrete time framework where

—2—

first we compare two polar cases. One is the situation where goods' prices
are fully flexible; the other is where goods' prices are pre—set due to overly

high transaction costs of last—minute goods price revisions.
The next step is to modify the framework, recognizing that there is
limited price flexibility, which depends on the cost benefit of potential

goods arbitrage.3 This enables us to derive the more general case, where the
nature of the deviations from ppp is closely related to the cost structure.
Solving this case provides us with a measure of the variance of deviations
from ppp, which in turn enables us to find boundary estimates for deviations
from ppp, and to derive comparative statics results that seem to be in
agreement with observed empirical regularities.

Section II describes the solution for the two polar cases of full price

flexibility and pre—set prices. Section LII generalizes the framework for the
case of limited price flexibility due to transaction costs. Section IV adds
the possibility of a short—run Phillips curve as a means of analyzing the

effects of deviations from ppp on output fluctuations. Section V summarizes
the findings. The appendix describes the solution for a specialized
stochastic system.

II. Flexible versus Pre—Set Prices
The suggested treatment of deviations from ppp that is described in
Section III can be applied to a variety of different models that use some

version of ppp. To demonstrate, let us consider one possible approach to
modeling exchange rates, by analyzing how the suggested methodology for

treating deviations from ppp modifies the results. It should be kept in mind,

however, that the suggested treatment is not specificto the approach
considered subsequently.

Consider the case of a small, open economy under perfect capital

mobility, in a world of one traded good. Suppose that the money market
equilibrium is given in a log—linear form:

—

Pt

—

a(i +

(1)

E e+i — et)

where m is the money supply at time t; t the price of the traded good; Yt
real output; e the spot exchange rate at time t (the domestic price of

foreign currency); and i the foreign interest rate. All variables, except
are expressed in logarithms, and Et is the conditional expectation

operator, based on time t's information. Equation 1 embodies the interest
rate parity condition, assuming the absence of a risk premium.
This paper focuses on the nature of the dependence of current prices

on the exchange rate (et). One polar case occurs when the price of the traded
good is pre—set before period t. This occurs when last—minute price revision
are extremely costly. In such a case ppp does not hold —— an outcome which
corresponds to the situation where transaction costs

of goods arbitrage and

price adjustment are high enough to prevent potential goods inflow (or outflow)

that will equalize goods' prices within period t. To describe this
possibility, suppose that the price Pt is set at the end of period t — 1 at
its expected p.p.p. level, i.e.

Pt Ei(e + p)

III. The case of limited price flexibility
The two polar cases analyzed in Section II correspond to the limiting

case. In general, good arbitrage and price adjustment will occur if their
benefits exceed the costs. To model this case, suppose that the real
transaction costs associated with price adjustment (per unit of output) are

given by C. C is a measure of the degree of goodst prices flexibility. The
lower C is, the greater the degree of price flexibility, and C = o corresponds

to the fully flexible prices case. We presume that the cost of making a price
change (which is taken to be of the lump sum variety) must be balanced against

the benefit of potential

goods arbitrage

(which is taken to depend on

the extent of deviations from ppp).

The good's price is pre—set at the end of period t—1 at its expected

level. If In period t the deviation from ppp that results from this pricing
rule is below the threshold limit C, the price stays at its pre—set level.
If, however, it exceeds the threshold C, the price differential is enough to

compensate for the transaction cost, and arbitrage of the good will occur. To
simplify, it is assumed that in this situation the arbitrage is forceful
enough to equate the good's price with the international price, such that ppp

holds. In the first case the price at time t corresponds to the pre—set
condition; in the second to the flexible condition. In the first case the

exchange rate at period t is e ; in the second it is

increase deviations from ppp. Further increase in a will further increase
deviations from ppp until a reaches its upper limit. This occurs
when a0 =

CI1.36

.

Above this point any further increase in a will reduce

deviations from ppp. This is because an increase in a0 shifts the probability
weight to the tails of the distribution. Thus, when deviations from ppp are
large enough, they will induce forceful arbitrage, which tends to reduce the

actual deviations. As can be seen from eq. 12, the upper boundary for the
standard deviation from ppp is a :

and it is attained for a = C•0.735

because it will increase the region where potential deviations from ppp induce
arbitrage. In terms of Figure 1, it shifts

markets C is lower. Polar examples for this might be the market for

foreign exchange, where C is small, versus the market for non—traded goods,
where C is large enough to nullify the law of one price.

IV.

ppp and Output Fluctuations
The analysis has so far neglected the possibility of a short—run Phillips

curve. In this section the previous analysis of deviations from ppp is
integrated with a discussion of a frictional labor market, where unanticipated

shocks result in an output response based on contracting elements. The
analysis considers how deviations from ppp affect output variability. This is
done by adding to the money market equilibrium condition (eq. 1) an aggregate
supply function, which is a modified version of models used by Flood and

Marion (1982) and Marston (1982). These authors consider the case of an
economy where nominal wage contracts are negotiated in period t—1, before
current prices are known, so as to equate expected labor demand to expected

labor supply. But actual employment in period t is demand—determined, and
depends on the realized real wage. These models also allow for partial
indexation, which may be set according to some optimizing criteria, and assume
built in asymmetry, where wages might be pre—set but goods' prices are

flexible. The new aspect of the subsequent analysis is in allowing for a
symmetric framework, where prices can exhibit short—run rigidity. The degree
of this rigidity is endogenously determined, and is manifested in the
deviations from ppp.

The model can be summarized by:

market in the absence of uncertainty). Actual wage (we) is allowed to adjust

indexation).

Despite the fact that deviations from ppp do not affect the value of
optimal wage indexation, they enter the loss function, affecting output
volatility (relative to its desired level).

En terms of eq. 30, deviations

from ppp enter the loss function via their effect on price volatility
(V1 ).

A more inflexible goods price structure (dC > 0) will reduce price

volatility ( because

).

The effect of lower price volatility on

output volatility is, however, tricky to assess. For an arbitrary choice of
wage indexation, it is indeterminate. Assuming, however, optimal wage
indexation (in terms of our loss function) lower price volatility turns out to

be undesirable. This is because the optimal wage indexation (b) takes
advantage of the negative correlation between supply shocks and goods prices,

by means of incomplete indexation. The extent of the beneficial effect of

—15—

optimal indexation depends, however, on the internal flexibility of prices.
Lower goods price flexibility reduces the importance of the above beneficial

effect, implying a larger loss function (

> 0) and larger deviations

from ppp. Notice that the causality runs in this case from a more inflexible
price structure to higher deviations from ppp and a higher output variabili].ty
(relative to desired output); and this argument is conditional on the optimal

setting of the degree of wage indexation. Thus, this analysis suggests that the
desirability of less volatile domestic prices (d C > 0) depends on the
efficiency of the wage indexation scheme.

V. Concluding Remarks and Implications:
The model analyzed in this paper integrates deviations from ppp with an
analysis of the determinants of the exchange rate, providing the links between

the two. It suggests a number of testable implications that seem to be in.
agreement with recent empirical studies.

Deviations from ppp are closely related to the total variability in the
economy by the structure of transaction costs in the goods market. •For a
given economy there is an upper boundary for deviations from ppp (as measured

by the variance of percentage deviation from ppp). This implies that the link
between variability in the economy and deviations from ppp differs between two

types of economy. For rather stable economies, increases in the

variability

of the shocks that affect them tend to increase deviations from ppp. For
highly unstable economies, increases in the variability tend to reduce devia-

tions from ppp. For example, starting from a stable period (in relative
terms) like the fifties and sixties, increases in variability due to oil
shocks and changes in regimes to floating rates will increase deviations from

ppp.12 To the degree that higher inflation rates al come with more variable

—16—

rates,13 an increase in the inflation rate results in higher deviations from

ppp. At some stage, however, higher inflation comes with lower deviations
from ppp. This suggests that in periods of hyperinflation, the ppp doctrine
might hold better than in periods of moderate inflation.'4 The doctrine of
ppp should also hold better between neighboring countries, and between
countries with larger potential trade, because of the lower transaction cost
of trade in goods between such countries.

The above discussion was conducted for a simplified model, but its

results have broader implications. Most of the discussion in the open macro
economy literature is conducted for models where some version of the law of

one price holds. This is correct even in models where domestic and foreign
goods are imperfect substitutes, as long as the price of each class of goods

in different locations is tied by the law of one price. The general question
is to what degree the results obtained by those models for the optimal values
of various endogenous behavioral parameters are robust to modification of the

law of one price. The above discussion demonstrates that deviations from ppp
and limited price flexibility can be added to the models in a way that leaves
the value of optimal parameters intact, affecting only the volatility of

various variables. It is also shown that the desirability of price
flexibility depends on the efficiency of the wage indexation scheme. With
optimal indexation a higher price flexibility will reduce output volatility.
A natural exterttion of the above analysis is to consider a multi—goods

world with multi—periods overlapping contracts. The addition of these aspects
should add continuity to the process of generating deviations from ppp, making
the bound

conditions for the variance of deviations from. ppp dependent on

the contracting technology and some average of the transaction costs of
different goods.

Appendix B
The purpose of this appendix is to add transportation costs to the

analysis of deviations from ppp under limited price flexibility. In such a
case, there are two costs to be considered in the price adjustment rule (eq.
9—10): the lump—sum type of cost of price adjustment (C) and transportation

costs, taken to be C per unit. The existence of transportation costs
differentiates domestic and foreign markets. Consider, for example, the case

where Pt < p + e ( Pt are prices in the pre—set regime). Because of the
existence of transportation costs (C) , the potential gains from goods
arbitrage (export in this case) are measured by (

p÷e—

) — Pt

Prices will adjust only if this expression exceeds the lump—sum cost of price

changes (C). Thus, if Pt < e + p we get

By good arbitrage we refer to those forces that tend to equate the
goods' prices with international prices, like potential trade
pressure. Those forces can be manifested in price adjustment and (or)

uses a similar pricing rule in the context of a
McCallum (1977)
closed economy. In general, we expect to observe more continuity in the
arbitrage process, resulting from having a spectrum of goods with
different transaction costs (C), and from the fact that the volume of
potential arbitrage in each good might correspond in a more continuous
manner to price differential (upper sloping arbitrage schedule). The
benefit of the simplifying assumption used in this paper is in providing
a tractable solution for deviations from ppp. Appendix B considers how
the analysis is affected if we add the possibility of transportation
costs. We find that whenever the lump—sum cost element is significant
the results of Section III are unchanged.

In such a case V0 =

Under fixed rate we get lower V0 because instability in the money market
is adjusted via the balance of payment mechanism instead of price
adjustment. Thus, we expect to observe lower deviations from ppp under
fixed rate (assuming o < CI1.36 ).
