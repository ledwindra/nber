Incidence and Environmental Effects of Distortionary Subsidies

JEL No. H23,Q52,Q58
ABSTRACT
Government policies that are not intended to address environmental concerns can nonetheless distort
prices and affect firms' emissions. We present an analytical general equilibrium model to study the
effect of distortionary subsidies on factor prices and on environmental outcomes. We model an output
subsidy, a capital subsidy, relief from environmental regulation, and a direct cash subsidy. In exchange
for receiving subsidies, firms must agree to a minimum level of labor employment. Each type of subsidy
and the employment constraint create both output effects and substitution effects on input prices and
emissions. We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy, where government involvement affects
emissions from both state-owned enterprises and private firms. Variation in production substitution
elasticities does not substantially affect input prices, but it does substantially affect emissions.

I. Introduction
Nearly all governments support particular firms or sectors by granting low-interest
financing, reduced regulation, tax relief, price supports, monopoly rights, and a variety of other
subsidies. Subsidies are not lump sum, but instead introduce distortions by favoring particular
firms, sectors, and/or inputs. This paper determines the incidence and environmental effects of
distortions induced by these subsidies, which are particularly common in environmentallysensitive industries. The model is calibrated and simulated to study the Chinese economy.
Many studies in environmental economics examine the effect of some environmental
regulation on the environment, e.g. how efficient a cap-and-trade scheme is at reducing
emissions relative to a command-and-control standard.

Others examine the effects of

environmental regulations on non-environmental outcomes, e.g. if strict emissions regulations
reduce employment or capital investment. These are often referred to as unintended
consequences of environmental regulations. Conversely, this model examines a different type of
unintended consequences: the effects of non-environmental policies on the environment. The
subsidies that we model are not necessarily intended to address environmental issues, but
because they affect prices and firms’ decisions in general equilibrium, such effects occur.
We present a two-sector general equilibrium model of an economy in which one sector
receives subsidies and the other does not. Our motivating example is the Chinese economy, in
which a large fraction of the economy is composed of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), receiving
subsidies from the government and coexisting alongside private firms.

We consider four

different ways in which regulators interfere with the subsidized sector. First, SOEs may have
easier or cheaper access to capital or to loans, modeled here as an interest subsidy. FisherVanden and Ho (2007) documents and studies substantial interest subsidies to Chinese
industries, including energy-intensive industries. Second, SOEs may receive an output subsidy.
Hsieh and Klenow (2009) model the Chinese economy where subsidies to output play a
prominent role. Third, SOEs may face less stringent environmental standards, modeled as a
subsidy to an emissions tax. Dasgupta et. al. (2001) show that Chinese SOEs have more
bargaining power and are therefore their pollution is monitored less intensively. Fourth and
lastly, SOEs incur extra costs along with the subsidies. In particular, SOEs are subject to a
regulation on the amount of labor that must be employed by them.

Yin (2001) models

overstaffing among Chinese SOEs and argues that overstaffing is widespread.

3
While our motivating example is the Chinese economy, our analytical model is general
enough to apply to several other examples. Other nations besides China exhibit these types of
economy-wide subsidies. Bergoeing et. al. (2002) study output and interest subsidies in Chile
and Mexico. Barde and Honkatukia (2004) list subsidies among various OECD countries. The
model also applies to policies within a country targeted at a single industry. For instance, the
U.S. auto bailout in 2008-2009 fits this model, since the subsidies implicit in the bailout were
aimed at only at some domestic, not foreign, manufacturers operating in the US.

In this

application, the labor constraint could be due to union contracts rather than government
regulation. Similarly, the airline industry could be modeled where the distinction between
subsidized and non-subsidized firms follows the distinction between legacy and low-cost
carriers. Lastly, the model could be applied to subsidization of a particular industry within an
economy; for instance agricultural subsidies within OECD countries.
Our subsidies differ from typical analysis of the incidence of subsidies or taxes in the
literature in that only some firms receive subsidies. In our equilibrium, subsidized and nonsubsidized (hereafter private) firms coexist only if subsidized firms are less productive. This
matches the empirical observation that subsidies tend to go to firms to prevent bankruptcy or to
support distressed firms facing foreign or domestic competition.
We find that subsidies tied to the use of a particular input (e.g. low interest loans, relief
from environmental regulation) have three effects. First, subsidized firms tend to increase
demand for the subsidized input (capital, emissions) at the expense of substitute inputs. This
substitution effect increases economy-wide demand for the subsidized input. Second, the
subsidized firm tends to produce more, increasing demand by the subsidized firm for all inputs
(an output effect).

Third, in general equilibrium, as input prices change, the private and

subsidized firms alter their usage of inputs. Overall, the price of the subsidized input and
complementary inputs increase at the expense of substitute inputs, and the subsidized sector
grows in size. Output subsidies can be viewed as a subsidy to all inputs, and therefore the
substitution effect described above is not present, though the output effect is.
In our model, firms must use a minimum quantity of labor in exchange for receiving
subsidies. If the minimum labor constraint binds, the marginal product of labor in the subsidized
sector falls below the wage and subsidized firms earn negative profits. The government then
provides a cash subsidy (hereafter a direct subsidy) to prevent subsidized firms from exiting the

4
market. Increasing the minimum labor constraint moves labor from the private to the subsidized
sector. The demand for capital therefore increases in the subsidized sector but decreases in the
private sector. The interest rate rises if the subsidized sector is more capital intensive than the
private sector.
To gauge the magnitude of the effects, we calibrate our model to the Chinese economy,
where the distinction between subsidized and private firms is clear in our data. We simulate for
base-case parameter values and conduct sensitivity analysis over the parameters describing each
sector's substitution elasticities in production. The key determinant of the incidence (the changes
in factor prices) of the policies is the factor intensities; in our simulation where the subsidized
sector is relatively capital-intensive, subsidies hurt labor more than they hurt capital. This
pattern is unaffected by the substitution elasticity values. In contrast, the effects on emissions
depend crucially on the substitution elasticity values. The greater the ability of one sector to
substitute into emissions away from an alternate input whose price increases, the larger that
sector's emissions increase.
In many developing countries, subsidies of the type we study are a significant fraction of
GDP. For example, Brandt and Zhu (2000) report that subsidies in China amount to 6.8% of
GDP in 1993. Further, van Beers and van den Bergh (2001) estimate worldwide subsidies are
3.6% of world GDP in the mid-1990s. Barde and Honkatukia (2004), report agriculture, fishing,
energy (especially coal), manufacturing, transport, and water are all heavily subsidized,
environmentally sensitive industries.
Despite the prevalence of subsidies, little is known about their general equilibrium
effect on factor prices and the environment.

Barde and Honkatukia (2004) discuss a few

channels by which subsidies may affect the quality of the environment. Input and output
subsidies, especially in environmentally sensitive industries, encourage the overuse of dirty
inputs. Bailouts, tax relief, and other cash subsidies prevent the exit from the market of the least
efficient producers, which are likely to be the most emissions intensive, which they call a
“technology lock-in” effect. Subsidies in the form of regulatory relief include exemptions from
environmental regulation, which directly increase the incentive to emit. Still, their analysis is
largely informal. Indeed, they note that "a thorough assessment would require a complex set of
general equilibrium analysis (to evaluate the rebound effect on the economy).'' 1 This paper

provides such a general equilibrium analysis, including all of the above channels. Fullerton and
Heutel (2010), (2007) use similar analytical methods to study the incidence of taxes (2007 paper)
and environmental mandates (2010 paper) but not non-environmental policies like subsidies.
Subsidies can also be used to protect favored industries against foreign competition.
Indeed, many trade agreements explicitly call for a reduction in subsidies. For example, Bajona
and Kelly (2012) examine the effect on the environment of eliminating the subsidies required for
China to enter the WTO and find that elimination of subsidies reduces steady state emissions of
three of four pollutants studied. van Beers and van den Bergh (2001) show in a static, partial
equilibrium setting how subsidies increase output and therefore emissions in a small open
economy. For example, if subsidies are sufficiently large, a country may move from importing
to exporting an environmentally sensitive good.

The increase in output in turn increases

emissions.
A number of authors study the effect of agricultural subsidies on the environment (Antle,
Lekakis and Zanias 1998), (Pasour and Rucker 2005). Price supports and output and input
subsidies encourage the use of dirty inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides, and encourage
marginal land to be converted from conservation to farming. On the other hand, the USDA in
2003 had over 17 agricultural subsidy programs ($1.9 billion) designed in part to improve
environmental quality, primarily by paying farmers to remove environmentally sensitive land
from production (Pasour and Rucker 2005). However, such restrictions have an ambiguous
effect on erosion and on fertilizer and pesticide use, since such restrictions encourage farmers to
farm the remaining land more intensively (Pasour and Rucker 2005, 110). Other subsidies, such
as output subsidies, magnify this effect. It is therefore important to analyze all subsidies together
in general equilibrium, as they can have offsetting or magnifying effects.
Previous work has provided an important first step in identifying the extent of subsidies
and likely channels by which they effect the environment. Still, the previous literature does not
examine the incidence of subsidies, and most prior work looks at individual subsidies in partial
equilibrium. An exception is Bajona and Kelly (2012), who provide a model where private and
subsidized firms coexist. They prove the existence of a general equilibrium in which subsidized
firms and private firms co-exist with the share of production of subsidized firms determined
endogenously by the subsidies, labor requirement, and technology difference. Bajona and Kelly
(2012) consider only two kinds of subsidies, direct subsidies and interest subsidies. We extend

6
their framework by considering as well output subsidies and regulatory relief and by making
emissions endogenous. 2

II. Model
Consider a closed economy consisting of two representative firms producing an identical
output good. Each firm has access to a production technology utilizing three inputs: capital,
labor, and pollution. Production here is net of abatement costs, so higher pollution input means
lower abatement costs, and therefore higher net production. 3 One firm is subsidized by the
government, as described later; call its output level G. The other firm is non-subsidized or
private; call its output level P. The subsidized firm's production function is
𝐺 = 𝐴𝐺 𝐹(𝐾𝐺 , 𝐿𝐺 , 𝐸𝐺 ),

where KG, LG, and EG are the quantities of capital, labor, and pollution used by the subsidized
firm, and AG is total factor productivity. We assume F is a constant returns to scale function.
Similarly,
𝑃 = 𝐴𝑃 𝐹(𝐾𝑃 , 𝐿𝑃 , 𝐸𝑃 ),

with AP, KP, LP, and EP defined analogously. Henceforth, we normalize AP to one.
� units of capital and 𝐿� units of labor inelastically. Thus,
Households supply 𝐾

𝐾𝑃 + 𝐾𝐺 = 𝐾
𝐿𝑃 + 𝐿𝐺 = 𝐿�.

� and 𝐿� are constant, yields
Totally differentiating each of these equations, noting that both 𝐾
�𝑃 𝜆𝐾𝑃 + 𝐾
�𝐺 𝜆𝐾𝐺 = 0,
𝐾
𝐿�𝑃 𝜆𝐿𝑃 + 𝐿�𝐺 𝜆𝐿𝐺 = 0.

Here 𝜆𝑖𝑗 is the fraction of the total supply of factor i that is employed by firm j (e.g.

� ). A variable with a caret represents a proportional change in that variable (e.g.
𝜆𝐾𝑃 = 𝐾𝑃 /𝐾
�𝑃 ≡ 𝑑𝐾𝑝 /𝐾𝑃 ).
𝐾

The private firm faces three prices, r, w, and τ, for inputs KP, LP, and EP, respectively.

The price of pollution τ is a government policy variable, while the prices of capital and labor are
endogenous. We follow Mieszkowski (1972) in modeling the private firm's choices over its

Bajona and Kelly (2012) also focus on trade effects, whereas the focus of the current paper is on incidence.

abatement cost functions.

inputs. Totally differentiating the private firm's three input demand equations yields two
independent equations: 4

The parameters eP,ij are the Allen elasticities of substitution (Allen 1938). The Allen
elasticity eP,ij is positive when inputs i and j are substitutes and negative when they are
complements. The own price Allen elasticity eP,ii is always negative. The parameters 𝜃𝑃𝑖

represent the share of total revenue spent on input i in sector P, e.g. 𝜃𝑃𝐾 ≡ 𝑟𝐾𝑝 /𝑞𝑃 𝑃, where qP

is the output price the good. Constant returns to scale implies zero profits, so 𝜃𝑃𝐾 + 𝜃𝑃𝐿 +
𝜃𝑃𝐸 = 1.

Totally differentiating the private firm's zero-profit condition yields
�𝑃 � + 𝜃𝑃𝐿 �𝑤
𝑞�𝑃 + 𝑃� = 𝜃𝑃𝐾 �𝑟̂ + 𝐾
� + 𝐿�𝑃 � + 𝜃𝑃𝐸 (𝜏̂ + 𝐸�𝑃 ).

(5)

Totally differentiating the private firm's production function and substituting in the firstorder conditions from the firm's profit maximization problem (marginal revenue product equals
marginal cost, for each input) gives
�𝑃 + 𝜃𝑃𝐿 𝐿�𝑃 + 𝜃𝑃𝐸 𝐸�𝑃 .
𝑃� = 𝜃𝑃𝐾 𝐾

(6)

The subsidized firm faces a different problem than the private firm, in four aspects. First,
subsidized firms receive a discount on their capital costs. The discount may arise from the
government guaranteeing repayment of funds borrowed by subsidized firms, direct loans from
the government at reduce interest rates, state owned enterprises (SOEs) borrowing at the
government's rate of interest, or as the government steering deposits at state-owned banks to
subsidized firms (common in developing countries) at reduced interest rates. Any of these
implicit or explicit subsidies imply a lower effective rental price of capital for the subsidized
firm, 𝑟𝐺 = (1 – 𝛾)𝑟, where γ is the interest subsidy rate.

Second, subsidized firms receive a subsidy of 𝜀 per unit of output. The output subsidy

may also be interpreted as a price support that applies only to the subsidized firm (for example,
the government buys excess demand above the market price from the subsidized firm and

4

The analytical general equilibrium modeling and solution strategy that we employ is in the style of Harberger
(1962). Other papers using similar methods include Mieszkowski (1972), Fullerton and Metcalf (2002), Fullerton
and Heutel (2007), and Fullerton and Heutel (2010). See, for example, Fullerton and Heutel (2007, p. 588-9) for a
derivation of equations (3)-(4).

8
distributes the goods to households). If the consumer price of subsidized firm output is 𝑞𝐺 , then

the effective output price that the subsidized firm faces is 𝑞𝐺𝑁 = (1 + 𝜀)𝑞𝐺 .

Third, the government reduces the environmental regulatory burden the subsidized firm

faces. In particular, the subsidized firm pays a pollution tax rate of 𝜏𝐺 = 𝜏(1 − 𝜙). Here 1 − 𝜙

may also represent the fraction of emissions reported by the subsidized firm if for example the
government monitors subsidized firms less often (Gupta and Saksena (2002) find subsidized

SOEs are monitored less often, and Wang et. al. (2003) find SOEs enjoy bargaining power over
environmental compliance). As with Fisher-Vanden and Ho (2007), we are able to investigate
how environmental regulations interact with other subsidies, like a capital subsidy.
Fourth, if subsidized and non-subsidized firms co-exist, some cost to receiving subsidies
must exist. Following Bajona and Kelly (2012), we model this cost in a simple way.

In

particular, we assume that in order to receive subsidies, the government requires labor
employment at subsidized firms to be greater than or equal to 𝐿�𝐺 . The minimum labor constraint
means the cost of receiving subsidies is a labor cost, which may include hiring lobbyists and/or

hiring labor in key districts to increase bargaining power. 5 In exchange for employing 𝐿�𝐺 , the
government covers any losses through a direct subsidy (cash payment), S. The labor constraint

binds if and only if the marginal product of labor in subsidized firms is below the wage rate,
which causes subsidized firms to earn negative profits. Subsidized and private firms then co-exist
if subsidized firms receive a direct subsidy large enough for the subsidized firm's profits to be
non-negative, including the direct subsidy. If the constraint does not bind, subsidized firms have
a competitive advantage and will drive the private firms from the market. Since this case is less
interesting, we consider only the case where the constraint binds.
The subsidized firm's cost-minimization problem is analogous to the private firm's costminimization problem, except the subsidized firm faces different input costs (for example,
replacing r with rG, the subsidized capital price) and the binding constraint on labor input, 𝐿�𝐺 .
Because of this constraint, the subsidized firm no longer is able to set its marginal revenue

product of labor equal to the wage. Rather, the constraint creates a shadow price of labor for the
subsidized firm, denoted wG. This shadow price equals the difference between the market wage

Shleifer and Vishny (1994) present a political economy model explaining why such labor constraints may arise in a
bargaining process as a result of the other types of subsidies modeled here.

9
w and the multiplier on the labor constraint. Since we always assume that the labor constraint is
binding, the market price w is strictly greater than the shadow price wG.
The solution to the firm's cost-minimization problem can thus be written in terms of the
shadow price of the constraint and the other subsidized prices in a manner similar to equations
(3) and (4). 6

(8)

In equations (7) and (8), the parameters 𝜃𝐺𝐾 and 𝜃𝐺𝐸 are the share of total subsidized firm

revenues paid to capital and pollution, respectively, less government subsidies (e.g. 𝜃𝐺𝐾 ≡
𝑟𝐺 𝐾𝐺 /𝑞𝐺𝑁 𝐺).

However, the parameter 𝜃𝐺𝐿� is not equal to 𝑤𝐿𝐺 /𝑝𝐺𝑁 𝐺. Rather, 𝜃𝐺𝐿� ≡

𝑤𝐺 𝐿𝐺 /𝑝𝐺𝑁 𝐺. In equations (7) and (8), demand for labor is a function of prices. Although the

constraint implies 𝐿𝐺 = 𝐿�𝐺 , the constraint creates the shadow price wG so that labor demand
under that shadow price, according to equations (7) and (8), is just equal to the minimum labor.
That is, the subsidized firm faces a shadow price of labor lower than the wage, which encourages
the subsidized firm to use more labor than it otherwise would have used.
The subsidized firm's profits are
𝜋𝐺 = 𝑞𝐺𝑁 𝐺 − 𝑟𝐺 𝐾𝐺 − 𝑤𝐿𝐺 − 𝜏𝐺 𝐸𝐺 + 𝑆.

We first model the case where equilibrium profits, net of subsidies, must equal zero. Such an
equilibrium condition might arise under free entry, for example. 7 In this case, one of the subsidy
values is determined in equilibrium; we assume that the zero-profit condition determines S once
the regulator chooses all of the other subsidies. Substituting the firm's first-order conditions from
the cost-minimization problem into the zero-profit condition implies:
𝜋𝐺 = 𝑞𝐺𝑁 𝐺 − 𝑞𝐺𝑁 𝐺𝐾 𝐾𝐺 − 𝑞𝐺𝑁 𝐺𝐸 𝐸𝐺 − 𝑤𝐿𝐺 + 𝑆 = 0,

where GK and GE are the derivatives of the production function with respect to inputs capital
and pollution. Then, since production is constant returns to scale, using Euler's theorem for
homogeneous functions yields

6

𝜋𝐺 = 𝑤𝐺 𝐿𝐺 − 𝑤𝐿𝐺 + 𝑆 = 0.

An alternate method of modeling the binding labor constraint does not use the shadow price of labor, and instead
derives equations similar to (7) and (8) but that are in terms of the value of the labor constraint itself rather than the
shadow price. This is similar to the method in Fullerton and Heutel (2010). This solution method is available upon
request from the authors.
7
Alternatively, if one interprets S as a “bailout,” the government may be motivated only prevent bankruptcy, not to
give positive profits to the subsidized firm.

10
Thus equilibrium subsidies are 𝑆 = (𝑤 − 𝑤𝐺 )𝐿𝐺 > 0, since the minimum labor constraint binds.

Substituting equilibrium direct subsidies into the zero profit condition and totally differentiating
yields
�𝐺 � + 𝜃𝐺𝐿� �𝑤
� 𝐺 + 𝐿�𝐺 � + 𝜃𝐺𝐸 (𝜏̂ 𝐺 + 𝐸�𝐺 ).
𝑞�𝐺𝑁 + 𝐺� = 𝜃𝐺𝐾 �𝑟̂𝐺 + 𝐾

(9)

Similarly, totally differentiating the production function and substituting in the first-order
conditions from the profit-maximization problem yields
�𝐺 + 𝜃𝐺𝐿� 𝐿�𝐺 + 𝜃𝐺𝐸 𝐸�𝐺 .
𝐺� = 𝜃𝐺𝐾 𝐾

(10)

The direct subsidy S drops out of equations (7)-(10). One could solve for the change in the direct
subsidy by totally differentiating 𝑆 = (𝑤 − 𝑤𝐺 )𝐿𝐺 , but it is not necessary to include to solve the
system (that would add one equation and one variable that does not show up in any other

equation). Intuitively, the lump-sum subsidy does not affect the firm's decisions and therefore
has no effect on any general equilibrium outcomes. 8
It follows that the equations describing the subsidized firm's decisions (equations (7)
through (10)) are independent of the assumption that the firm earns zero profits. Indeed, we
could assume instead that the firm's profits 𝜋𝐺 are allowed to be positive, and that the level of
firm profits is an exogenous policy parameter that can be controlled by the government. That is,
the profits 𝜋𝐺 represent rents that the regulator allows the firm to capture, perhaps through

barriers to entry.

To see this, assume that 𝜋𝐺 > 0. Then the equation relating firm profits to the shadow price

of the constraint still holds, but firm profits no longer must equal zero:
𝜋𝐺 = 𝑤𝐺 𝐿𝐺 − 𝑤𝐿𝐺 + 𝑆.

The endogenous direct subsidy S is now larger, given the positive exogenous level of profit 𝜋𝐺 .
Totally differentiating this equation yields

where 𝛽𝑤𝐺 ≡

𝜋�𝐺 = 𝛽𝑝𝐺 �𝑝̂𝐺𝑁 + 𝐺� � − 𝛽𝑟 �𝑟̂𝐺 + 𝐾
� + 𝐿�𝐺 � + 𝛽𝑆 𝑆̂,
8

The subsidized firm can only increase direct subsidies by increasing losses, so the direct subsidy is lump sum in the
sense that profits net of subsidies are unchanged regardless of the subsidized firm's decisions.

𝜋𝐺

𝑞𝐺𝑁 𝐺

. Combining the above two equations, canceling

yields equation (9). The derivation of equation (10)

does not depend on the assumption of zero profits. Thus, equations (7) through (10) hold as long
as the direct subsidy is large enough so that subsidized profits are non-negative.

We are

interested in the case where both firms choose to operate, where neither firm is at a corner
solution for any of its input demands, and our differential analysis is applicable. The condition
𝑆 ≥ (𝑤 − 𝑤𝐺 )𝐿𝐺 ensures the subsidized firm operates, and the private firm operates if and only

if the cost of receiving subsidies is positive, which occurs when the minimum labor constraint
binds, 𝑤 − 𝑤𝐺 > 0. 9

Finally, the minimum labor constraint binds:
𝐿�𝐺 = 𝐿�𝐺 .

(11)

Thus equations (7)-(11) characterize the subsidized firm's decisions. An alternative method to
incorporating the binding labor constraint would be to set the input demand equation for labor
equal to the labor constraint, then totally differentiate:
� 𝐺 + 𝐺� .
𝐿� 𝐺 = 𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐿 𝜃𝐺𝐾 𝑟̂𝐺 + 𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 𝜃𝐺𝐸 𝜏̂ 𝐺 + 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 𝜃𝐺𝐿� 𝑤

(11')

Equation (11') demonstrates that the input demand equation, in terms of the Allen elasticities and
the input prices, characterizes the subsidized firm's demand for labor, which must equal the
required minimum labor. It can be shown that equation (11') can be derived from equations (7),
(8) and (11) given known restrictions on the Allen elasticities. Thus, replacing equation (11) with
(11') yields identical solutions.
The two firms produce identical goods, so perfect competition implies that consumer prices
are equal:
𝑞�𝑃 = 𝑞�𝐺 .

(12)

The consumer price for the subsidized firm's output is not equal to the price net of subsidies that
the firm faces, qGN.

Finally, government policy determines the relative prices faced by the subsidized firm.
Totally differentiating the definition 𝑟𝐺 ≡ 𝑟(1 − 𝛾) yields

In the case of Cobb-Douglas production functions, we can write the condition 𝑤 − 𝑤𝐺 > 0 in terms of the
parameters. In the more general formulation here where we impose no functional forms, we cannot specify 𝑤 −
𝑤𝐺 > 0 in terms of the parameters. However, since in practice one can check 𝑤 − 𝑤𝐺 > 0 directly, this is not a
great concern.

𝑟̂𝐺 = 𝑟̂ − 𝛾�,

(13)

𝜏̂ 𝐺 = 𝜏̂ − 𝜙�

(14)

where 𝑟̂𝐺 and 𝑟̂ again are proportional changes (e.g. 𝑟̂ = 𝑑𝑟/𝑟), but 𝛾� ≡ 𝑑𝛾/(1 − 𝛾).
Similarly,

𝑞�𝐺𝑁 = 𝑞�𝐺 + 𝜀̂ ,

(15)

where 𝜙� ≡ 𝑑𝜙/(1 − 𝜙) and 𝜀̂ = 𝑑𝜀/(1 + 𝜀).

The model consists of equations (1) through (15). The five exogenous policy variables are

𝜀̂, 𝜏̂ , 𝜙�, 𝛾�, 𝐿� 𝐺 . The sixteen endogenous variables are:

�𝑃 , 𝐿�𝑃 , 𝐾
�𝐺 , 𝐿�𝐺 , 𝑟̂ , 𝑤
𝐾
�, 𝑞�𝑃 , 𝑃�, 𝑞�𝐺 , 𝐺� , 𝑟̂𝐺 , 𝑤
� 𝐺 , 𝜏̂ 𝐺 , 𝑞�𝐺𝑁 , 𝐸�𝐺 , 𝐸�𝑃 . The model does not determine the price

level, so the solution requires a normalization. We normalize relative to the price of output by
setting 𝑞�𝑃 = 0. Now, the remaining fifteen endogenous variables are the solution to the linear
system of equations (1)-(15).

III. Solution
We solve the model through successive substitution. The steps of the solution method
are available from the authors. We present the results in two parts. First, we present the
incidence results, that is, the effect of policy changes on the returns to capital and to labor.
Second, we present the emissions results.
III.A Incidence
We derive a closed-form solution for 𝑟̂ and 𝑤
�. However, here we present only the

expression for 𝑟̂ . By subtracting equation (6) from equation (5) and invoking the normalization
𝜃

𝜃

𝑞�𝑃 = 0, it can be shown that 𝑤
� = − 𝜃𝑃𝐾 𝑟̂ − 𝜃𝑃𝐸 𝜏̂ . Thus, if the policy variable 𝜏 remains
𝑃𝐿

𝑃𝐿

unchanged, then the sign of the change in the wage resulting from any other policy change is the
opposite of the sign of the change in the rental rate. This does not mean that one factor gains and
one loses, since both of these prices are relative to an arbitrary numeraire. Rather, if 𝑟̂ > 0 and

𝑤
� < 0, then labor bears a disproportionately high share of the burden of the policy change
relative to capital.

The solution for 𝑟̂ is

Here 𝐵𝑃 ≡ 𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐸 − 𝑒𝑃,𝐸𝐿 − 𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝑃,𝐿𝐿 , 𝐵𝐺 ≡ 𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐸 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 , and

𝐷 ≡ −𝜆𝐾𝐺 𝜃𝐺𝐾 �𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐾 − 2𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 � − 𝜃𝑃𝐾 𝜆𝐾𝑃 �𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐾 − 2𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝑃,𝐿𝐿 �. The appendix shows
that 𝐷 is positive given constant returns to scale.

Given that 𝐷 is positive, the coefficient on 𝛾� in the expression for 𝑟̂ must be positive.

An increase in 𝛾, the subsidy to capital, increases the demand for capital by the subsidized firm,
which pushes up the price of capital. 10

The sign of the coefficient on 𝜙� is opposite of the sign of BG. We show in the appendix

that BG < 0 if and only if an increase in emissions reduces the marginal product of capital
(𝑓𝐾𝐸 < 0). Assume this condition holds, and it follows that the sign of the coefficient on 𝜙� is

positive. An increase in the emissions tax subsidy 𝜙 decreases the price of emissions for the
subsidized firm. This creates an output effect that expands production, increasing demand for

capital and therefore its price. Only if capital and emissions are strong substitutes, so that 𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐸

is positive and large enough to dominate the three other negative terms in 𝐵𝑃 , does a substitution
effect dominate, and an increase in the emissions tax subsidy reduces the demand for and price
of capital. The coefficient on 𝜏̂ is negative, since an increase in 𝜏̂ increases the price of

emissions. 11

An increase in the output subsidy can be viewed as equivalently a decrease in the price of
all three inputs. The coefficient on 𝜀̂ in equation (16) is positive. The increase in the output

subsidy creates only an output effect, causing the subsidized firm to want to expand production.
But because its labor input is fixed at 𝐿�𝐺 , it can only expand by increasing its capital and
emissions demand. This unambiguously raises the return to capital.

The coefficient on the labor constraint, 𝐿� 𝐺 , has the same sign as the expression

𝜆𝐾𝐺 ⁄𝜆𝐾𝑃 − 𝜆𝐿𝐺 ⁄𝜆𝐿𝑃 . This expression is positive when the subsidized firm is capital-intensive
relative to the private firm; that is, when firm G has a higher capital-to-labor ratio than P. One

10

Since the supply of capital is fixed, the increase in capital in the subsidized firm replaces demand in the private
firm through the higher interest rate.
11
Technically, we assume that emissions and capital do not switch from being substitutes to complements or the
reverse. If so, then it is possible that emissions and capital are substitutes for one firm, and complements for the
other. In this case, a decrease in 𝜏̂ may have a different effect than an increase in 𝜙� as 𝜏̂ directly affects emissions
of both firms.

14
might think that a tightening of the labor constraint must hurt labor, since it is forcing its quantity
employed to be lower. However, there is a fixed labor stock, and any reduction in labor used in
one firm is matched by an increase in labor in the other firm. Rather, a tightening of the labor
constraint is a burden that falls only on the subsidized firm. If the subsidized firm is capitalintensive, then that burden will fall harder on capital than on labor, and the price of capital falls.
III.B. Emissions
Consider first the effect on emissions in the private sector EP. Instead of presenting a
closed-form solution, it is more helpful to present an intermediate equation in the solution steps
that expresses the change in emissions as a function of just the labor constraint, the emissions
price, and the endogenous capital price:
𝜆
𝐸�𝑃 = − 𝜆𝐿𝐺 𝐿� 𝐺 + 𝜃𝑃𝐸 �𝑒𝑃,𝐸𝐸 − 2𝑒𝑃,𝐸𝐿 + 𝑒𝑃,𝐿𝐿 �𝜏̂ + 𝜃𝑃𝐾 𝐵𝑃 𝑟̂ .
𝐿𝑃

(17)

If 𝐿�𝐺 decreases, then more labor must be used in the private firm, and holding all else constant

this increases the amount of emissions used in the private firm (from equation (4)). If the

emissions price 𝜏 increases, then holding all else constant the emissions used in the private firm
decreases. Lastly, if the policy change is such that the price of capital increases, then the

quantity of emissions used in the private sector decreases as long as BP < 0. When capital and
emissions are very substitutable, BP > 0, the substitution effect from the capital price increase
dominates, and emissions increases.
All of the effects on emissions in the private firm from any of the policy changes occur
via their effect on r, as seen in equation (17), except for the additional effects from 𝐿�𝐺 and 𝜏̂

(which also affect 𝑟̂ ). The closed-form solution for 𝐸�𝑃 can be found by substituting equation
(16) into equation (17). The results provide the same intuition as does equation (17). This

solution is presented in tabular form in Table 1 (along with the closed-form solution for 𝐸�𝐺 ,
discussed below). For each row in Table 1, the entry under the 𝐸�𝑃 column is the coefficient on
that row’s exogenous variable. For instance, the coefficient on 𝛾� in the closed-form expression

for 𝐸�𝑃 is

−

1
𝜃 𝐵 𝜃 𝜆 �𝑒
− 2𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 �.
𝐷 𝑃𝐾 𝑃 𝐺𝐾 𝐾𝐺 𝐺,𝐾𝐾

When BP < 0, this coefficient is negative. An increase in 𝛾 increases r, which decreases EP.

15
The coefficients on 𝐿�𝐺 and 𝜏̂ include both the direct effect in the equation (17) and the indirect

effects via the effects on 𝑟̂ from equation (16).
An analogous expression for 𝐸�𝐺 is

𝐸�𝐺 = 𝐿�𝐺 + 𝜃𝐺𝐸 �𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐸 + 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 ��𝜏̂ − 𝜙�� + �𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 �𝜀̂ + 𝜃𝐺𝐾 𝐵𝐺 (𝑟̂ − 𝛾�).

(18)

The first term comes directly from equation (8), where if nothing else changes, then the change
in emissions equals the change in labor. The second term shows that the change in the net
emissions price to the subsidized firm, 𝜏̂ − 𝜙�, negatively affects the emissions used by the

subsidized firm. The third term demonstrates that in increase in the subsidized firm's output
subsidy, 𝜀, increases its use of the emissions input. Lastly, the final term is the effect of the

change in the net price of capital to the subsidized firm, 𝑟̂ − 𝛾�. It includes the endogenous 𝑟̂ .

When the net price increases, the quantity of emissions used decreases, unless the substitution
effect between capital and emissions dominates and BG > 0.

As with equation (17), equation (18) is not a closed-form expression, but the closed-form
solution can be found by substituting in equation (16). This is presented in the second column of
Table 1. Most of the resulting closed-form coefficients conform to the intuition presented by
merely examining equation (18).
expression for 𝐸�𝐺 is

For instance, the coefficient on

𝜀̂

in the closed-form

1
�𝜃 𝐵 𝜆 �𝑒
− 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 ��.
𝐷 𝐺𝐾 𝐺 𝐾𝐺 𝐺,𝐾𝐿
The first two terms in the first set of parentheses are positive and represent the direct effect that
�𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 � +

can be seen in equation (18), and the rest of the terms are from the effect of 𝜀̂ on 𝑟̂ . Equation
(16) shows that an increase in 𝜀 will increase r. Thus, combined with equation (18), as long as

BG < 0, this second term will be negative. In this case the direct effect from 𝜀̂ shown in equation
(18) and the indirect effect via its effect on 𝑟̂ move in opposite directions.

One other closed-form coefficient is worth discussing. The coefficient on 𝐿�𝐺 in the

expression for 𝐸�𝐺 is

1
�−𝜆𝐿𝑃 𝜆𝐾𝑃 𝜃𝑃𝐾 �𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐾 − 2𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝑃,𝐿𝐿 �
𝐷𝜆𝐿𝑃

+ 𝜃𝐺𝐾 �𝜆𝐾𝐺 𝜆𝐿𝑃 �𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐿 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐾 � + 𝜆𝐾𝑃 𝜆𝐿𝐺 (𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐿 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐿𝐿 �

+ (𝜆𝐾𝐺 𝜆𝐿𝑃 − 𝜆𝐿𝐺 𝜆𝐾𝑃 )�𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐸 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 ��}

16
All of the terms in this expression are positive, with the exception of the last line of the
expression.

The first part of the last line,

𝜆𝐾𝐺 𝜆𝐿𝑃 − 𝜆𝐿𝐺 𝜆𝐾𝑃 ,

is positive whenever the

subsidized firm is capital-intensive. The second part of the last line, 𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐸 − 𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 , is positive
whenever capital is a better substitute for emissions than is labor, in the subsidized firm. Most of

the coefficient is positive and picks up the fact that a reduction in 𝐿�𝐺 is a burden on the
subsidized firm and causes it to contract, reducing its demand of input EG. However, the firm

can also substitute among its inputs. The subsidized firm could respond to its requirement to
decrease labor demand (i.e. its increase in the shadow price of labor) by demanding more
emissions or more capital. If it is capital-intensive and if labor is a better substitute for emissions
than is capital, then the increase in the shadow price will lead to a substitution effect that works
to increase emissions in that sector. Even in this case, this effect will only dominate if it is larger
than all of the other positive terms in the above coefficient.
We also examine the change in total emissions from both firms, E. Since this is the sum
𝐸
𝐸
of EP and EG, the proportional change in emissions 𝐸� = 𝐸𝑃 𝐸�𝑃 + 𝐸𝐺 𝐸�𝐺 ; i.e. it is the sum of

the two firms’ proportional change in emissions, weighted by the share of total emissions for
each firm. We present the expression for 𝐸� in terms of the endogenous variable 𝑟̂ rather than a
closed-form solution to ease interpretation:
𝐸� = �

The first coefficient in this equation shows that the effect of 𝐿� on 𝐸� depends on both the
+�

𝐺

factor shares of labor across the firms and on the allocation of emissions across the two firms. If
the subsidized sector has a large share of total emissions, then this coefficient is likely to be
positive, since an increase in the allowed labor in the subsidized sector will allow it to expand
and demand more labor.
Every term in the next coefficient, on 𝜏̂ , is negative, since a higher emissions tax will

reduce emissions from both firms. Likewise, the coefficient on 𝜙� is positive, since an increase
in the emissions tax subsidy will reduce the subsidized firm’s emissions. The coefficient on 𝜀̂

17
is positive, since an increase in the output subsidy to the subsidized firm will expand output and
increase its demand for emissions. Likewise, the coefficient on the capital subsidy 𝛾� is positive

so long as BG < 0; a higher subsidy encourages the subsidized firm to expand and therefore
demand more emissions.

All of the aforementioned effects represent output effects, while all of the substitution
effects are contained in the coefficient on 𝑟̂ . This coefficient is negative so long as BG and BP
are both negative. If any exogenous policy changes ends up increasing the capital rental rate

(relative to the numeraire), then the substitution effect will cause both firms to reduce emissions.

IV. Calibration and Simulation
We choose parameter values to calibrate the model to investigate the magnitude of the
effects found from the analytical solutions, many of which were difficult to sign unambiguously.
The 2006 China Statistical Yearbook provides data on capital and labor inputs, profits, and
emissions.

Because the Chinese data (except emissions) are separated into state-owned

enterprises (SOEs) and private firms, these data provide a good source for the calibration. We
consider the SOEs to be the subsidized sector and the private firms to be the private sector.
The data give the value of capital and labor inputs in both sectors, and thus we can
directly calculate the input shares 𝜆𝐾𝑃 , etc. We chose sulfur dioxide as the pollutant. The
appendix shows that a calibration with chemical oxygen demand yields almost identical
parameter values. Calibration of other parameters, including the expenditure share parameters
𝜃𝑖𝑗 , is described in the Appendix. The Allen elasticities of substitution in each sector are not

provided in the China Statistical Yearbook. Instead, we use the same values as in Fullerton and
Heutel (2010). Those values are based on earlier estimates reported in de Mooij and Bovenberg
(1998), and they suggest that capital is a slightly better substitute for pollution than is labor.12
We assume that the cross-price Allen elasticities are identical across the two sectors. But,

De Mooij and Bovenberg (1998) actually present estimates of substitution between capital, labor, and energy, and
they consider estimates from Western Europe. Considine and Larson (2006) use data from US electric utilities and
find that capital is a better substitute for pollution than is labor. Intuitively, when pollution reductions are required,
new capital is installed, and thus capital and pollution are substitutes. An alternate estimate is provided by Lu and
Zhou (2009), who estimate Allen elasticities between capital, labor, and energy for China. They do not differentiate
between private firms and SOEs. They find that capital and energy are complements and that labor is a better
substitute for energy than is capital.
12

18
because of the different expenditure shares across sectors, the own-price elasticities are not
identical across sectors.
Table 2 summarizes the calibrated parameter values (the own-price elasticities are not
presented but are derivable from the rest of the parameter values). The subsidized sector is
𝜆𝐾𝐺

relatively capital-intensive (

𝜆𝐿𝐺

>

𝜆𝐾𝑃
𝜆𝐿𝑃

). The share of expenditures that goes towards pollution

taxes in both industries (𝜃𝐺𝐸 and 𝜃𝑃𝐸 ) is very small.

We simulate the incidence and environmental effects of four different exogenous policy

changes. First, we set 𝛾� = 10%, simulating an increase in the capital subsidy rate to the

subsidized firm. Second, 𝜀̂ = 10%, simulating an increase in the output subsidy rate to the

subsidized firm. Third, 𝜙� = 10%, simulating an increase in the pollution tax subsidy rate to the

subsidized firm. Last, 𝐿�𝐺 = −10%, simulating an decrease in the minimum labor constraint

faced by the subsidized firm (this is negative so that all four policy simulations are a benefit to
the subsidized firm, although the direct subsidy S will in equilibrium decrease to leave the

subsidized firm's profits unchanged). 13 Panels B and C of Table 3 report the results from these
four policy changes. Row 1 in each of those panels represents the simulations using the base
case parameter values; rows 2 through 5 represent sensitivity analysis of the elasticity parameters
(see panel A).
Focusing first on the base case simulations, the effect of either the capital subsidy or the
output subsidy on incidence (𝑟̂ and 𝑤
�) is identical: a 10% increase in either subsidy increases

the rental rate by 5.45% and decreases the wage rate by 2.32% (like the analytical results, these

price changes are normalized relative to the price of the output good). This change is driven by
the factor share parameters. Since the subsidized sector is capital-intensive, a subsidy to it is
likely to benefit capital relatively more than labor. The pollution tax subsidy in panel C does not
affect the rental rate or the wage to two decimal places. This is because pollution expenditure
shares are so small that a change in that input price has minimal general equilibrium effects. The
change in the labor constraint reduces the capital price by 6.56% and increases the labor price by
2.79%. This may seem counterintuitive, since a decrease in the required use of labor seems like
it should decrease demand for labor and therefore its price. But, the overall labor resource
constraint always binds, and thus the reduction of the labor constraint in the subsidized sector is
Note that since t 𝛾� ≡ 𝑑𝛾/(1 − 𝛾), 𝛾� = 10% corresponds to an increase in 𝛾 equal to t 𝑑𝛾 = 0.10 ∙ (1 − 𝛾) =
0.043 = 7.5%. Similarly, the increase in 𝜀̂ is 0.1 and the increase in 𝜙� is 0.02 or 2.5%.

13

19
equivalent to forcing more labor into the private sector. Because the private sector is laborintensive, a reduction in the labor constraint increases the demand for labor relative to the
demand for capital, driving up the wage.
Next, consider the pollution effects of all four policy simulations under the base case
parameter values.

The capital subsidy and output subsidy both have identical effects on

pollution in the private sector (a 0.83% reduction), since the private sector's demand responds
only to the input prices, which are identical under the two policy changes. By contrast, the 10%
capital subsidy causes only a 0.33% increase in the subsidized sector's emissions, while the 10%
output subsidy causes a 3.69% increase in the subsidized sector's emissions. The output subsidy
substantially alters the quantity of output produced by the subsidized sector, not just its relative
input prices. This increase in output of the subsidized sector is the primary driver of its increased
emissions. The change in the pollution tax subsidy has no substantial effect (to two digits) on the
private sector's emissions, but it increases the subsidized sector's emissions by 3.36%. Lastly,
the change in the labor constraint increases the private sector's emissions and decreases the
subsidized sector's emissions. The decrease of 10% in the subsidized firm's labor requirement
reduces its emissions by just under 10%. This reflects the expression at the end of section III for
the coefficient on 𝐿�𝐺 in the expression for 𝐸�𝐺 . Although that expression could not be signed,

most of its terms are positive, indicating a negative output effect (i.e. relaxing the labor
constraint reduces emissions). The labor constraint forces the subsidized firm to use more labor,
and therefore produce more output, than is optimal. Relaxing the labor constraint therefore
reduces output, which reduces demand for the pollution input. The negative terms indicate the
substitution effects from substituting emissions for labor. Since the overall sign ends up positive
in this simulation, the output effect dominates.
Table 3 also considers alternate parameter values. We consider alternate values for the
substitution elasticities in production, since these are the parameters about which we know the
least. We investigate changes in two of the cross-price Allen elasticities for each of the two
sectors. In each of rows 2 through 5, we change one of those Allen elasticities to 1 and leave all
other parameter values unchanged in the base case. Row 2 in Table 3 sets 𝑒𝑃,𝐾𝐸 = 1; this
represents a case where emissions and capital are strong substitutes in the private sector. In row

3, emissions and labor are strong substitutes in the private sector (𝑒𝑃.𝐸𝐿 = 1). Rows 4 and 5

make the same assumptions, respectively, in the subsidized sector (𝑒𝐺,𝐾𝐸 = 1 and 𝑒𝐺,𝐸𝐿 = 1).

20
The results of the simulations for each of these new parameter values are presented in the
remaining rows of Table 3.
Consider first how these different elasticity values affect the incidence results (𝑟̂ and
𝑤
�). Differences between rows 1 through 5 for any of the four policy variables are smaller than

two decimal places. Substitution elasticities in production do not substantively affect general
equilibrium factor prices.
Next, consider how the different elasticity values affect the emissions results (𝐸�𝑃 and

𝐸�𝐺 ). For the capital subsidy 𝛾�, the largest decrease in private sector emissions occurs in row 3,

where labor and emissions are strong substitutes in the private sector. Similarly, the only
decrease in subsidized sector emissions occurs in row 4, where capital and emissions are strong
substitutes in the subsidized sector. In each of these rows, the changes in the relative input prices
(the same across all rows) have different effects on the demand for emissions based on each
sector’s substitution elasticity.

Changes in the substitution elasticity in one sector do not

materially affect emissions in the other sector, however.
For the output subsidy 𝜀̂, the emissions from the private sector mimics its emissions

under the capital subsidy 𝛾� since the factor prices are the same. But the subsidized sector
expands relative to the private sector under this policy, and so emissions increase in each row.

When capital and emissions are strong substitutes (row 4), the response of subsidized emissions
to the output subsidy is larger. Since the price of emissions is fixed by policy, demand for
emissions rises by relatively more than demand for capital, whose demand is moderated by the
increase in price of capital. Similarly, the response of subsidized emissions is especially strong if
emissions and labor are strong substitutes (row 5). The price of emissions is fixed by policy,
whereas the shadow price of labor increases, motivating the subsidized firm to substitute
emissions for labor.
The emissions tax subsidy 𝜙� has no effect on emissions in the private sector since it does

not change any prices that sector faces. It changes the relative price of emissions for the
subsidized sector, and thus the increased subsidy (lower net emissions price) increases the
emissions of that sector. When the substitutability between emissions and either input is large in
the subsidized sector (rows 4 and 5), the increase in its emissions is larger.
The loosening of the labor constraint (𝐿� 𝐺 = −10%) always increases emissions in the

private sector and decreases emissions in the subsidized sector. This is due to an output effect

21
(the private sector expands and the subsidized sector contracts). But the magnitude of the change
in emissions depends on the substitution effects. When the private sector has more ability to
substitute between emissions and labor (row 3), its emissions increase is larger. When the
subsidized sector has more ability to substitute between emissions and capital (row 4), its
emissions decrease is larger.
Lastly, panel D of Table 3 explores the effect of these policy changes on total emissions,
𝐸� . The change in total emissions is a weighted average of the change in the emissions of the two
𝐸
𝐸
sectors (𝐸� = 𝐸𝑃 𝐸�𝑃 + 𝐸𝐺 𝐸�𝐺 ). In addition to the four policy changes from panels B and C, in

panel D we present the change in total emissions in response to a 10% increase in 𝜏, the
emissions tax. This tax increase directly applies to both the subsidized and private sectors, in
contrast to the four other policies.
SOEs account for 75% of total sulfur emissions, so for cases in which private and SOE
emissions move in opposite directions, the change in subsidized emissions receives more weight.
Therefore, the capital subsidy increases total emissions slightly, because the larger effect on
private sector emissions receives less weight. Subsidizing the capital accumulation of pollutionintensive SOEs has a surprisingly small effect on total emissions due to general equilibrium
effects: the resulting rise in the price of capital causes private firms to reduce output and
therefore pollution.
In contrast, the output and pollution subsidies have a much larger effect on SOE
emissions, so the increase in total emissions is still substantial, despite the offsetting reduction in
emissions from the private sector. Similarly, relaxing the labor constraint has a much larger
effect on emissions from SOEs, so overall emissions fall despite the increase in private sector
emissions.
An increase in the pollution tax directly decreases pollution in both sectors. Therefore,
total emissions are usually more sensitive to the pollution tax than to other policies, which have
offsetting effects on pollution across sectors. However, relaxing the labor constraint actually
decreases pollution more than increasing the pollution tax, since moving labor out of the
subsidized sector causes output and therefore pollution to fall substantially in that sector. Further,
changes in the output and emissions subsidies effect total emissions by a similar order of
magnitude as changes in the emissions tax.

22
V. Conclusion
We present an analytical general equilibrium model to study the effects of distortionary
subsidies on incidence and on pollution. Policies intended to support one firm or one sector, like
input or output price subsidies, can also have unintended general equilibrium price effects and
effects on environmental quality. We calibrate the model to gauge the numerical magnitude of
these effects, and in particular to examine how they depend on the substitution elasticities in
production.

The incidence effects (factor prices) are relatively unaffected by substitution

elasticities, but emissions are substantially affected by the substitution elasticities. The better
substitute pollution is for an input whose price increases, the more emissions will increase.
Many studies in environmental economics examine the effect of environmental
regulation, such as pollution taxes, on the environment. This paper argues that the unintended
consequences of non-environmental policies on pollution are also important. Indeed, we show
that reducing output and emissions subsidies to pollution-intensive firms reduces pollution by a
similar order of magnitude as raising emissions taxes. Policies that reduce employment at
subsidized firms have even larger effects. Further, reducing non-environmental subsidies has
welfare benefits associated with moving capital and labor to more productive sectors, in addition
to reducing pollution. Therefore, the welfare benefits of reducing subsidies are likely to be
greater than the welfare gains from raising pollution taxes.
Our model is simple and omits many salient features of an economy that might also
affect emissions and incidence. However, its simplicity is a virtue in that it allows us to isolate
individual effects without confounding complications. Our calibration is based on data from
China, where our data source clearly delineates between subsidized and non-subsidized firms.
The model can be applied to other economies and other industries. Further work could consider,
for example, how subsidies to domestic auto manufacturing firms affected prices and emissions
from that sector in the United States, or how agricultural subsidies in OECD countries affect
emissions. We leave these interesting extensions to future research.

Appendix
Proof that 𝑫 > 𝟎.

If 𝑒𝑖,𝐾𝐾 − 2𝑒𝑖,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝑖,𝐿𝐿 is negative regardless of 𝑖 = 𝐺, 𝐿, then 𝐷 > 0. Dropping the

subscript 𝑖 for convenience and using the definition of Allen elasticity, we have:
𝑒𝐾𝐾 − 2𝑒𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝐿𝐿 =

(𝐿2 |𝐵𝐾𝐾 | − 2|𝐵𝐾𝐿 |𝐾𝐿 + 𝐾 2 |𝐵𝐿𝐿 |)
|𝐵|𝐾 2 𝐿2

Here 𝐵 is the bordered Hessian from the firm's cost minimization problem, and 𝐵𝑖𝑗 is the

bordered Hessian with column 𝑖 being all zeros except a one at row 𝑗. Since the determinant of
the bordered Hessian is negative by concavity, we must show the last term is positive.
Evaluating the determinants in the last term results in:
𝐿2 |𝐵𝐾𝐾 | − 2|𝐵𝐾𝐿 |𝐾𝐿 + 𝐾 2 |𝐵𝐿𝐿 |

= 2𝐿2 𝑓𝐿 𝑓𝐸 −𝐿2 𝑓𝐿2 𝑓𝐸𝐸 − 𝐿2 𝑓𝐸2 𝑓𝐿𝐿 +2𝐾𝐿𝑓𝐸 𝑓𝐾 𝑓𝐸𝐿 − 2𝐾𝐿𝑓𝐸2 𝑓𝐾𝐿

Since 𝑓 is constant returns to scale, the marginal products are homogenous degree zero.
Therefore:

Substituting in equations (A1)-(A2), collecting terms, and then substituting in (A3) results in:
𝐿2 |𝐵𝐾𝐾 | − 2|𝐵𝐾𝐿 |𝐾𝐿 + 𝐾 2 |𝐵𝐿𝐿 | = −𝑓𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝑓𝐿 + 𝐾𝑓𝐾 + 𝐸𝑓𝐸 )2 = −𝑓𝐸𝐸 𝑌 2 > 0.

Here the last equality follows from Euler's theorem and the term is positive by concavity. Hence,
we have:
𝑒𝑖,𝐾𝐾 − 2𝑒𝑖,𝐾𝐿 + 𝑒𝑖,𝐿𝐿

The sign of the above equation is independent of 𝑖 and is negative by concavity which completes
the proof.

Since the determinant of 𝐵 is negative by concavity, the above equation is positive if and only if
an increase in emissions raises the marginal product of capital (𝑓𝐾𝐸 > 0).
Calibration
The data in Appendix Table A1 come from the 2006 China Statistical Yearbook (CSY).
The factor share ratios 𝜆𝑖𝑗 are calculated directly from these data, e.g. 𝜆𝐾𝑃 =

Calibration of policies 𝝓, 𝜸 and 𝜺

Calibration of 𝜙 and 𝛾 depends on the functional form of the production function.

Assuming Cobb-Douglas production, the firm's first order conditions (China has production
taxes t, which we add and assume are identical for G and P) imply

where 𝛼 is the capital share parameter. We set 𝜀 = 0, since some argue in China that actually
SOEs are forced to sell at below market prices. These equations may then be combined to get

Similarly, for 𝜙,

𝛾 =1−
𝜙 =1−

𝐾𝑃 𝑌𝐺

Here 𝜎 is the emissions intensity of output. Bajona and Kelly (2012) estimates

and Wang and Wheeler (2003) estimate it at 5.7 for chemical oxygen demand (COD).

by sector.

𝑃

This gives emissions of 𝐸𝐺 = 642 for SO2 and 𝐸𝐺 = 382 for COD.

Wang and Wheeler (2005, footnote 13) reports 𝜏 equals 0.5 yuan/kilogram for COD and

0.4 for SO2. This corresponds to 0.05 100M yuan per 10K metric tons for SO2 and 0.04 for
COD. 14
Construct 𝒓, total subsidies

To get the interest rate, we need to compute depreciation as depreciation is included in value
added but not profits. Assuming a depreciation rate of 𝛿 = 0.06, we have:
𝐷𝐸𝑃𝐺 = 𝛿𝐾𝐺 = 5,011

and the same for private. The interest rate is then
𝑟=

𝑟𝑘 𝜋𝐺 + 𝜋𝑃 + 𝐷𝐸𝑃𝐺 + 𝐷𝐸𝑃𝑃
=
= 0.16
𝐾𝐺 + 𝐾𝑃
𝑘

This is a high interest rate, but probably not unreasonable given China's very fast economic
growth. We add depreciation to capital income in all the calculations below.
We now construct capital and emissions subsidies:
𝛾𝑟𝐾𝐺 = 7,764

Calibration of Wages

𝜙𝜏𝐸𝐺 = 21 for SO2, = 16 for COD.

We have from the profit equations (including a tax 𝑡 on value added):
14

𝜋𝐺 = (1 − 𝑡)𝐹(𝐾𝐺 , 𝐿𝐺 , 𝐸𝐺 ) − 𝑟𝐺 𝐾𝐺 − 𝑤𝐿𝐺 − 𝜏𝐺 𝐸𝐺 + 𝑆.

The emissions tax revenue does not measure all spending on environmental regulations, but total environmental
compliance spending is still small relative to GDP.

31
Assuming after subsidy profits equal zero, we have:
𝑤𝐿𝐺 = (1 − 𝑡)𝐹(𝐾𝐺 , 𝐿𝐺 , 𝐸𝐺 ) − 𝑟𝐺 𝐾𝐺 − 𝜏𝐺 𝐸𝐺 + 𝑆
= 𝑌𝐺 − 𝑡𝑌𝐺 − 𝑟𝐾𝐺 + 𝛾𝑟𝐾𝐺 − 𝜏𝐸𝐺 + 𝜙𝜏𝐸𝐺 + 𝑆

= 27,177 − (6,220 − 0.05 ∙ 642) + 7,764 − 0.05 ∙ 642 + 21 + 193 = 17,404.

This assumes that the environmental taxes are counted in the data on total taxes paid. The
private data wage equation is the same equation with no subsidies, which results in 𝑤𝐿𝑃 =

27,852. The calibration is slightly different using COD instead of SO2.
Given the wage data, we have

𝑆 = 𝑤𝐿𝐺 − 𝑤𝐺 𝐿𝐺
= 17,211

Calibration of Shares

We calibrate the shares using the standard assumption that tax income is allocated proportionally
to each factor according to their factor shares. For private shares, we have
𝜃𝑃𝐾 𝑌𝑃 = 𝑟𝐾𝑃 + 𝜃𝑃𝐾 (𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠 − 𝑒𝑛𝑣. 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠𝑃 )
𝜃𝑃𝐾 =

Similarly,

𝜃𝑃𝐾 =
𝜃𝑃𝐿 =

𝜃𝑃𝐸 =

𝑟𝐾𝑃
𝑌𝑃 − (𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠 − 𝑒𝑛𝑣. 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠𝑃 )

𝜏𝐸𝑃
= 0.0002
𝑌𝑃 − (𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠 − 𝑒𝑛𝑣. 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠𝑃 )

This is the calibration for SO2; the values for COD are only slightly different.
For the subsidized firm, we must also include the subsidy revenue.
𝜃𝐺𝐾 𝑌𝐺 = 𝑟𝐺 𝐾𝐺 = 𝑟𝐾𝐺 − 𝛾𝑟𝐾𝐺

𝑌𝐺 − (𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠 − 𝑒𝑛𝑣. 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠𝐺 )

11,531 − 7,764

27,177 − 6,220 + 21

32
The share for G is lower, but this is a comparison of apples to oranges.

𝑟𝐾𝐺
𝑌𝐺

is 0.55, which is

higher than private as expected since SOEs tend to be more capital-intensive.
Similarly,
𝜃𝐺𝐸 =

𝜃𝐺𝐿 =

𝜏𝐸𝐺 − 𝜙𝜏𝐸𝐺
= 0.0002
𝑌𝐺 − (𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠 − 𝑒𝑛𝑣. 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠𝐺 )

𝑤𝐺 𝐿𝐺
= 0.8202.
𝑌𝐺 − (𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠 − 𝑒𝑛𝑣. 𝑡𝑎𝑥𝑒𝑠𝐺 )

We report only four significant digits, so the sum of shares differs slightly from one due to
rounding.
