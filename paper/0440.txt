Wage Expectations in the Labor Market
Survey Evidence on Rationality

ABSTRACT

Using a new set of directly observed wage expectations among firms, this
paper finds that in general firms' forecasts fail the unbiasedness and efficiency

requirements of weak—form rational expectations. These market participants
consistently underestimate the wages they actually end up paying, and their
expectations do not efficiently utilize the information in past realizations.
The mean absolute forecast error of two percent compares with an error of only

five percent if static expectations were held. The major source of wage forecast error seems to be errors in predicting demand, rather than in predicting

supply or the general price level. Wage forecast errors are positively correlated
across fields with distinct supply patterns, and are positively correlated with

quantity forecast error. The properties of stochastically weighted expectations
and the effectiveness of the wage and price controls of the early 1970's are
also discussed.

In much of the recent economic literature, expectations play a role akin to
that of the higher being in theological discussions: commanding the center of

attention, powerfully affecting events, but rarely revealing itself directly. With
only scant or indirect empirical evidence, economists have fallen back on rules of

thumb such as "rational expectations (R.E.) may be a reasonable assumption for

financial markets but a tenuous one for labor markets". Survey evidence of
expectations in the financial market have been studied elsewhere1 and a useful

summary of the methodology is presented in Friedman (1980). This paper shall
examine survey evidence of expectations in the labor market.
The effectiveness of monetary policy in Phillip's curve type trade—off s

depends critically on the rationality of firms and workers. Do agents on the demand
side of a competitive market that meets annually have or develop R.E.? If there is
systematic error in their forecasts of market wages, is it due to errors in forecasting

demand or supply, or to misjudging the general price level that will prevail? How
has inflation affected their accuracy? These are all questions that must be
answered empirically before we can judge the distortions caused by inflation, and the
real effects of monetary policy- on labor markets.

This paper uses a new set of directly observed wage expectations among market

participants. Section I will test the unbiasedness and efficiency properties of
these observed expectations. The sources of observed forecast error will be
analyzed in section II, followed by the conclusion.

Section I. Tests of Weak—Form Rationality
Every year large firms hire inexperienced college graduates in competitive

markets. The supply to these markets is largely determined four years previously —

the

time it typically requires to earn a Bachelors degree. Since 1948, Frank

Endicott of Northwestern University has published the results of his annual survey

of employers' wage expectations. The survey of about 170 large and medium sized

2.

corporations is conducted in November, calling for half—year ahead forecasts of the
monthly starting wages of inexperienced college graduates by field of specialty,
2
as well as data on past realizations . Together these firms comprise a substantial
force in the market, hiring about one—seventh of all new engineers for example.
The statistical properties of the Endicott data are discussed in Appendix A.
The statistical tests of this section will show that employers' expectations

are not far from the mark, hut that in six of the eight fields tested these
expectations fail the unbiasedness and efficiency requirements of weak form

rationality. These basic results are generally in accord with those of Turnovsky
and Wachter (1972), who reject the hypothesis of R.E. among the Livingston sample

concerning the average weekly wage in manufacturing. On the other hand, In the
Endicott sample of market participants I do find evidence of rational expectations

of wages In some more disaggregated markets.3 While the wage forecast error is
small in absolute size, less than two percent of the actual wage on average, it is

significant. For comparison, if firms naively held static expectations, the
worst they would do would be a forecast error of five percent. The mean absolute
error in a slmle regresion on trend in the full sample of realizations is only
about one percent.

Rational expectations are tested in Table 1 by regressing the realized
wage on the wage that had been predicted:
(1)

Wta+b t_1+e

If agents have R.E., then a=O and b=1; the expected wage is an unbiased predictor

of the actual wage. F—tests accept this null—hypothesis in the fields of sales,
chemistry and mathematics, but reject it in the other five fields. In accord
with R.E., there is no significant evidence of autocorrelated errors in any of

the fields. On average, firms repeatedly underestimate what they will actually
end up paying in all eight fields.

Implicit in this discussion is the firm's loss function for errors in

forecasting wages. The unbiasedness tests in Table 1 employ two alternative

3.

assumptions: that firms optimize their forecasts for 1) the linear wage, or for

2) the log wage. By Jensen's Inequality, an unbiased forecast of some variable X
will in general be a biased forecast of a convex non—linear function of X. Rather
than conduct a random search over non—linear functions, I have taken the log of
wages as a plausible candidate.

If firms optimized their forecasts for the log of

wages, they need not exhibit R.E. in linear wages even if they do in log wages.

Table 1 shows evidence of this in only one case. Since the rest of the unbiasedness
results are unchanged by taking the log transformation, the remainder of this paper
shall refer to the linear form only.
It is worthwhile looking in more detail at the case of engineering, where

firms' expectations are farthest from the mark. The cob—web supply structure and
sensitivity to demand shocks of this market have been studied by Freeman (1976).

Engineering is among the fields with the most volatile supply, as measured by the

coefficient of variation of its share in total degrees. But it is also the one
field where enrollment data is systematically collected, so the information needed
to forecast supply six months or three years ahead is readily available4. Yet
employers consistently err in their wage forecasts.
Note that employers seem to have R.E. in some fields with cob—web structure,
such as chemistry and mathematics, but fail in liberal—arts, accounting and business

where supply is smoother and no evidence of the more complicated cob—web supply

structure has been found (Freeman and Leonard 1978). Supply variation, as indicated
by the existence of cob—web supply, does not appear to be the dividing line between
fields in which employers do or do not exhibit R.E. These results indicate that if

employers understand how wages are determined, then either they cannot predict supply
even in fields dominated by simple trend growth, or they cannot accurately predict

industry demand six months ahead. Alternatively, they may be able to predict real
market clearing wages, but fail to forecast the general price level. Section II

4.

will examine the sources of this forecast error in more detail.

Firms that predict wages for a number of Eields may be able to form more
efficient forecasts by exploiting the cross—field error structure. The appropriate test of joint unbiasedness in this case would be Zeliner's (1962) seemingly

unrelated regression procedure, presented in Table 2. The test statistic A,
which is — 2 times the log of the Likelihood ratio, allows us to reject the

null hypothesis of joint unbiasedness, a=o and b=l, across all eight fields
for the sample period 1965 to 1978 at the 90% confidence level, and across the
four fields withrequisite data for the slightly longer period 1962 to 1978 at
the 99% confidence level.

To be rational, expectations must not only be unbiased, they must also

efficiently use the available information. In particular, expectations and
realizations should identically incorporate the information contained in past

realizations (see Pesando 1975). In the specification that

the hypothesis implied by R.E. is that h1 = h

for all i, and a a. Since six

out of the eight. fields fail Bartlett's test for homoskedastic errors across

equations (2) and (3), the usual Chow test for equality of coefficients is not

valid. Nullineaux (1978) suggests subtracting (3) from (2) yielding:

Under the null hypothesis, all the coefficients should equal zero, and there
should be no autocorrelation of the errors. Choosing N to minimize the standard
error of (3), F—tests allow the rejection of the null—hypothesis of R.E. in all

fields except chemistry and mathematics. The evidence against efficiency in
Table 3 is weaker for economics, which fails the Mullineaux type test, but passes

a Chow test for equality of coefficients. Note also in Table 3 that the forecast
errors in engineering, liberal—arts and sales are not orthogonal to past actual
wages: direct evidence against R.E.

In this section I have presented the results of two separate tests of weak—form

R.E.: unbiasedness and efficiency. Two of the eight fields, chemistry and
mathematics, pass both tests. If the fields are considered independent Bernoulli
trials, then we can state at a 75 percent level of confidence that employers do not
have rational expectations.

While in general employers' expectations are significantly different than
those required by R.E., it is arguable whether it would profit any firm to invest

in the information needed to improve the accuracy of these forecasts. When past
actual wages could be used to improve forecasting as noted above, it is difficult

to justify why firms do not use them efficiently, since the information is presuma-

bly at hand and the processing nearly costless. The same argument holds for
correcting the bias in forecasts. That firms find it costly to err in their wage
forecasts can be inferred from a simple market test: from the long and profitable
existence of consulting firms that survive by performing compensation surveys of
professionals, including new hires, and selling the results, the obvious conclusion
is that other firms are willing to pay to be told what market wages are or will be.

This is not implausible, given the developed planning and budgeting mechanism in
firms today.

If a firm offers too little, it risks encountering delay and difficulty

6.

in filling its openings, or getting poor quality workers with higher training and

turnover costs. If it offers too much, it will get locked into paying more than
it needed to. For a firm hiring 100 engineers whose market clearing wage is
$25,000, the mean absolute error of 2 percent found in the sample translates into

an overpayment of $50,000 in the first year. The resulting compression of the wage
structure is likely to create upward pressure on the wages of other employees in

the firm. In the following section I demonstrate some of the other data that could
be used to improve wage forecasts at little cost to the firm.

Section II. The Sources of Forecast Error
Why do employers err in their forecasts? Should we be surprised that their
expectations are not rational? It would be troubling if in practice employrs were
not predicting a supply that had been largely fixed four years earlier. It would
be slightly more comforting to know they erred in forecastig market demand or
inflation six months ahead. This section tries to determine whether employers
erroneously forecast wages because of errors in predicting supply or demand or

the general price level. The underlying assumption is that employers understand
that real wages in a competitive market are determined by supply and demand.

Consider the following simple model of the labor market for new college

graduates. The market demand for graduates in the

Assume that the errors are independently identically distributed with mean zero.

As noted in the previous section, firms consistently underestimate aáross time

and fields the nominal wages they end up paying. There are three ways this may
occur in the above model.

1) The firms underestimate the price level, P.
2) The firms overestimate D, the common component of supply.
or 3) The firms underestimate G, the common component of demand.
For example, if firms underestimate C by the amount G' then

and the wage forecast error is simply

i3

If errors in projecting G are the only errors the firms make, then wage fore-

cast errors across firms will be perfectly correlated. In addition, if firms
underestimate demand, then both the actual wage and the actual number of hires

will be greater than expected, due to movement up the supply curve. The evidence
I shall present in this section suggests that errors in forecasting demand are
the major source of wage forecast error.

In the Endicott Survey, employers forecast not only the wages they expect to
pay six months in the future, but also the number of people they expect to hire

at that wage. Since the expected market clearing wages are not greatly dispersed,
the quantities demanded by each firm are summed to give a rough estimate of market

demand5. If employers know the true demand, but err in predicting supply, then
I expect to observe a negative correlation between wage forecast error and quantity

forecast error. Alternatively, if the market supply schedule were known to all
employers six months ahead but demand were a mystery, wage forecast error would be
positively correlated with the quantity forecast error6. For example, let firms

expect a demand curve shifted further out than actually prevails. This will
intersect the known supply curve at a higher wage and a higher quantity than

actually occurs— yielding the positive correlation. Empirically, such demand
surprises seem to dominate the market. Although the quantity data is not very
reliable7, quantity forecast errors are positively correlated with wage forecast
errors in three of the four fields for which the requisite data was available for

the period 1962 to 1978. For accounting, the correlation coefficient was .77,

for sales .63, for engineering .47, and for business —.13.
This evidence of demand side surprises is reinforced by the positive

correlation of forecast errors across fields in Table 4. Since the supply cycles

9.

of the various fields are distinct (Freeman

and Leonard 1978), and in some cases

the fields are substitutes, the correlation of forecast errors across fields would
be due to a common supply shock if firms

were ignorant of massive demographic changes,

which is unlikely. The evidence again points to common errors across firms in
forecasting market demand.

I obtain a clear picture of the source of wage forecast error by testing for
the orthogonality of the error to past information that is readily available. The
theory of R.E. states that forecast errors should be uncorrelated with such informa-

tion. In all eight fields wage forecast error is orthogonal to real wage lagged
four or five years— a key variable

determining supply. Similarly, with the

exceptions of sales and chemistry, forecast error is orthogonal to the number of

graduates lagged one year. Engineering, however, tells a different story. A
substantial portion of engineering supply is determined by freshman year enrollments.
This information is made available by the

Engineering Manpower Commission, facilita-

ting supply forecasts three years ahead. Yet the firms in the Endicott sample
do not appear to use this information to form

unbiased forecasts. I find a signi-

ficant negative correlation between engineering enrollments three or four years

previously and current forecast error. This is consistent with a world in which
employers are surprised by a shift in supply that occured four years ago.
Surprisingly, the wage forecast error is not significantly correlated with
the current or past year's rate of inflation, so there is no strong evidence that
misperceptions of inflation account for the forecast error8.
of the forecasts has declined in recent

The absolute accuracy

years. In engineering business and liberal

arts the error is significantly correlated with last

year's price level. This,

however, suggests a simple scale effect: the larger the level of nominal wages,
the larger the error.

Lucas (1976) and others have argued that if

monetary policy is perfectly

anticipated, it will be matched by price level changes and have no real effects.

10.

Barro (1978) has presented empirical support for this model, showing that real
output changes were correlated with unexpected monetary policy, while price

level changes may be explained by anticipated monetary policy. To corroborate this
rational expectations model, I would need to find that wage forecast error was

correlated only with that part of monetary policy which was unanticipated. I find
that with the exception of engineering, wage forecast error is orthogonal to
expected money supply, and curiously, to unexpected money supply as defined by

Barro (1978). It is implausible that firms that have difficulty forecasting
demand in their labor markets could accurately predict inflation and monetary policy,
particularly that part of money supply that Barro defines as unexpected. A more
plausible interpretationis that monetarypolicy affects the wage and price level
only with long lags, so that actual market wages as well as expectations are little
affected by current monetary policy.

Even if perfectly anticipated, inflation creates what some companies consider

real problems of adjustment. ". . . the inflationary trend of wages in general. . . (has)
put the price so high that it is difficult to keep the salaries of present employees

in line with the increasing starting rates of graduates." "Salary compression

will

force reductions in the number of college graduates we can hire." The first quote

is from the 1953 Endicott Report, the second is from 1979. Starting wages are
typically more responsive to market pressures than are the wages of established

workers. Employers may forecast starting wages in line with established wage
structures, which would help explain why they have consistently underestimated
actual starting wages during the past twenty years of inflation.

How did employers wage expectations react to the wage and price controls imposed

during the early seventies? Such controls are sometimes recommended as the only
policy short of inducing a recession that can reduce inflationary expectations,

albeit at the cost of reduced economic efficiency. The Endicott data shows that

11.

in November, 1971, before wage—price guidelines had been firmly established
following the freeze of August 15, 1971, firms expected wages to increase by only

one percent over their 1971 levels. This decline in expected wage growth is not
solely due to the freeze, since actual and expected wage growth had already slowed

significantly prior to the freeze. In November of 1970 fIrms expected wage growth
of only two percent, as expectations reacted quickly to the slowing of actual

wage growth. Three years later, rather than expecting a burst of wage inflation
with the phase—out of controls, firms were predicting only a three percent
increase,below the guidelines and below the actual five percent increase that

occured during 1974. While controls were in place, wage expectations did not become
significantly more accurate, perhaps because although particular controls did
limit wage growth, controls policy itself was unstable during this period.

Finally, if one wants a rule of thumb to describe wage expectations, they seem
to be extrapolative in these market

.

In

contrast to Turnovsky and Wachter's results,

in this data set the extraolative model fits the observed expectations better than
the adaptive expectations model does, with an adjusted R—squared of .99.

In sum these results suggest that firms would fall short of the requirements

of R.E. even in a world without changing inflation rates. It appears that employers
err in forecasting wages for the most part because they err in predicting demand.

Section III. Conclusion
Expectations play such an important role in economic theory that the scant

direct empirical evidence available bears considerable interest. The evidence from
the Endicott Survey of market participants tells a mixed story, allowing the
acceptance of the rational expectations hypothesis in two of the eight fields tested.
Employers appear to err in forecasting market demand six months ahead,

and do not efficiently utilize a supply indicator set four years previously in

12.

engineering. All of this suggests the usefuliness of further empirical study of
the formation of expectations.

Appendix A. The Statistical Properties of Weighted Averages
The Endicott Report has published only weighted averages of actual

and expected wages since 1965. These are the wage data used in this paper.
The weighted average is given by

The bias of the weighted average equals J *

I argue that it

is reasonable to assume that COV(Z.,W.) = 0 in the Endicott data since the

scale of demand by field differs greatly across firms - some hire no engineers,

others hire hundreds. This scale effect probably dominates the negative
covariaflce one might expect between quantity and wage from movement along a

demand durve. Under the assumption that COV(Z.,W) = 0, if the null-hypothesis

Further tests also support the validity of the use of weighted
expecta-

tions in this sample. Replicating the unbiasedness tests with unweighted
expectations changes the result only in the field of business. For the
fields for which requisite data is

available, the F-statistics against the null-

hypothesis a=o and b=l are engineering:

an additional test, I pool time-series data

for the above four fields for the year 1962 to 1964 during which weighted

hypothesis of equality of coefficients at the .01 level when actual wages
are regressed on weighted or unweighted

expected wages. All of this suggests

that the results reported in the text are not affected by the use of
weighted
expectations.
If firms that hire more people invest

more in information to improve

their forecasts, then the weighted average will have a lower variance than
the unweighted average, and may have a lower mean-squared_error. If the

So, assuming constant bias over time, the efficiency and ortho—

of weighted averages.

1. Empirical work on price and interest rate expectations has been done by Friedman,
Gibson, Mullineaux, Pyle, Turnovsky, and Turnovsky and Wachter. Turnovsky and Wachter
also tested wage expectations, rejecting rational and simple adaptive and extrapolative

models of expectations. With the exception of Friedman, all of these authors used the
Livingston expectations data.

2. The actual question asked on the 1978 Endicott Survey is: "The table on the
following page has been designed to gather information regarding the number of

beginning college graduates, both men and women, recruited by your company last

year and the number to be recruited during the next twelve months. We are interested in hirings at the bachelor's level and also at the Master's level.

addition, you are asked to indicate average starting rates for graduates of 1978
classes and to estimate, as realistically as possible, what the average starting

rates will be for 1979 graduates. By average starting salary, we mean actual first—
month gross earnings. In estimating starting salaries for 1979, please indicate
what you think the average will be at the end of the season, taking into account past
trends, inflation, and possible competition for the best qualified graduates in
certain fields."

3. To the extent that firms can set wages they will trivially fulfill the requirements
of R.E. However, wages do seem to clear these markets and unemployment is typically
low. As evidenced by College Placement Council Data, wage offers do change during
the course of a recruiting season.

4. Before 1965 enrollment data was collected and published by the U.S. Office of
Education. In a notable case of the private market stepping in to serve a function
that government had ceased to fulfill, the Engineering Manpower Commission of the
Engineers Joint Council has collected engineering enrollment data since 1965.

5. More strictly, I only observe directly the average of each firm's expectation
of a point on its own demand curve. It is possible for a few firms to expect high
market demand and report the resulting high wages driving the firm up its own un-

changed demand curve. While this may be true for a few firms that do not expect
their demand to shift with market demand, it cannot be consistent behavior for the

market as a whole. If the firms expect high market demand, then in a representative
sample, the average of each firm's own expected demand at a given wage will indicate

market demand. In any case, the arguments in the text are more striking if they are
interpreted simply as each firm wrongly predicting its own demand, which should be
easier than predicting market demand.

6. Here we relax the assumption that supply responds only to past, not current, real
wage.

7. Actual and expected hires are reported for different samples and so are not
strictly comparable.

I used average hires per firm.

8. Wage forecast error is not in general significantly correlated with errors in
forecasting the inflation rate as measured by the Livingston data. This suggests that
firms have difficulty predicting the real wage rate. Direct evidence of employers'
inflation rate expectations from the Endicott Report for 1965, 1976, and 1978 are
.10, .08, and .08, which compare with the actual rates of change of the GNP price
deflator of .09, .05, and .09 respectively.

21.

8. While the extrapolative model in which expectations are given as a function of
the past two years realizations is the best rule of thumb, the S.E.E. is typically
minimized in a regression that includes the actual wage lagged three years.
