    "abstract": "\n\nWe use administrative data linked to the complete formal business registry to study a 2018 policy shift in Colombia that made nearly half a million Venezuelan undocumented migrants eligible for a resident visa. Immigrants who receive the visa increase their economic activity in the form of higher entrepreneurship by a factor as high as 12, bringing it to parity with native Colombians four years later. To establish causal estimates, we develop a novel extension of a regression discontinuity design. Our design uses variation in the running-variable (coming from rain) to instrument for migrants\u2019 choices to apply for visas.\n\n",
