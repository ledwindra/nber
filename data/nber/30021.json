    "abstract": "\n\nThis article develops a method for quantitatively tracking the agenda of the British Parliament\u2014by which I mean the substantive topics on which Parliamentary debate was focused\u2014from 1810-2005 using descriptions of 1.7 million Parliamentary debates from the Parliamentary Hansard. This provides a new tool for analyzing the evolution of the British political system across nearly two centuries. I describe and validate this new measure and then present an application that focuses on assessing the influence of the party in government on the Parliamentary agenda.\n\n",
