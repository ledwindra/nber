ABSTRACT
This paper infers the terms of trade effects of Free Trade Agreements (FTA's) with the structural gravity
model. Using panel data methods to resolve two way causality between trade and FTA's, we estimate
direct FTA effects on bilateral trade volume in 2 digit manufacturing goods from 1990-2002. We deduce
the terms of trade changes implied by these volume effects for 40 countries plus a rest-of-the-world
aggregate. Some gain over 10%, some lose less than 0.2%. Overall, using a novel measure of the change
in iceberg melting, global efficiency rises 0.62%.

Introduction
The proliferation of regional trade agreements in the 1990’s alarmed many trade policy
analysts and popular observers because trade diverted from non-partners reduces their
terms of trade. The harm to outsiders could even outweigh the terms of trade gains to
partners, reducing the efficiency of the world trading system. This paper calculates the
terms of trade effects, and a novel measure of the global efficiency effects, of 1990’s trade
agreements in 2 digit manufacturing sectors. The results are reassuring: regionalism
delivered benefits while negligibly harming outsiders. Some countries gain over 10%, a
few lose less than 0.2% and global efficiency rises 0.62%.
Theory gives great prominence to the terms of trade effects of trade agreements while
simulation models illustrate the theory with numerical measures of terms of trade changes
due to tariff changes. In contrast, there is little empirical evidence on the effect of
trade agreements on the terms of trade, because terms of trade are notoriously hard to
measure and there are difficult inference problems with ascribing causation.1 Our solution
is to estimate volume effects using the empirical gravity model, and then deduce their
terms of trade implications using the restrictions of structural gravity. The remarkable
confirmation of structural gravity in Anderson and Yotov (2010b) justifies this intensive
use of the structure.
Our research extends a large empirical literature on the trade volume effects of Free
Trade Agreements (FTA’s) based on the gravity equation. Notable studies of the volume
effects of FTAs include Frankel (1997), Magee (2003) and Baier and Bergstrand (2002,
1

Feenstra (2004, pp. 197-99) reviews the literature. Studies using prices directly are quite limited
in scope due to the difficulties in assembling comparable price data across a wide range of countries
as well as inferring the effect of FTAs on prices. Chang and Winters (2002) address both problems
using export unit values at the 6 digit Harmonized System level for Brazil. See their footnote 5, pp.
891-2, for discussion of the severe limitations. They treat prices as set by a foreign and domestic
firm in a duopoly pricing game that avoids general equilibrium considerations. Clausing (2001) uses a
partial equilibrium model disaggregated by sector that links import volume changes to tariff changes for
Canada, and does not go on to link them to price changes. Romalis (2007) simulates the equilibrium
price changes induced by the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) and the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) tariff changes using detailed demand elasticities estimated with a “difference
in differences based estimation technique to identify demand elasticities that focuses on where each of the
NAFTA partners sources its imports of almost 5,000 6-digit Harmonized System (HS-6) commodities and
comparing this to the source of European Union (EU) imports of the same commodities. The technique
enables identification of NAFTA’s effects on trade volumes even when countries production costs shift.”

2004, 2007). Early findings on the effects of FTAs and trading blocs on bilateral trade
flows were mixed,2 but recent developments in the empirical literature that deal effectively
with two way causality show that trading blocs and free trade agreements have large
direct effects on aggregate bilateral trade between member countries relative to nonmember countries. Baier and Bergstrand (2007) find that, on average, a FTA induces
approximately a 100% increase in bilateral trade between member relative to non-member
countries within ten years from their inception. Volume changes like these, larger than
explicable by tariff changes, are plausible because FTA’s typically induce unobservable
trade cost reductions alongside the formal tariff reductions that are the direct object of
the agreement. Non-tariff barriers are typically also reduced between FTA partners3 while
the enhanced security of bilateral trade induces relationship-specific investment in trade
with partner counter-parties. Compared to Romalis (2007) focused on tariff changes in
NAFTA, our approach focuses on these induced changes.
The terms of trade, the ratio of the index of sellers’ prices to the index of buyers’
prices, is measured consistently with the underlying theory for each country in our data.
The bilateral volume effects of FTA’s lower bilateral trade costs between partners directly
while general equilibrium effects of FTA’s indirectly change multilateral resistance (the
sellers’ and buyers’ incidence of trade costs) of every country in the world. General
equilibrium also links changes in sellers’ incidence to changes in sellers’ prices while
buyers’ prices move with buyers’ incidence measured by inward multilateral resistance.
These price changes are consistently aggregated into terms of trade changes.
We estimate the volume and terms of trade effects of free trade agreements implemented between 1990 and 2002. In contrast to much of the empirical gravity literature,
we estimate trade gravity equations disaggregated at the 2 digit ISIC level in manufacturing. We find large volume effects comparable to the aggregate estimates of Baier and
2

For example, Bergstrand (1985) found insignificant European Community (EC) effects on bilateral
member’s trade and Frankel et al (1995) supported his findings. Frankel (1997) found significant Mercosur
effects on trade flows but even negative EC effects on trade in certain years. Frankel (1997) also provides
a summary of coefficient estimates of the FTA effects from different studies. Ghosh and Yamarik (2004)
perform extreme-bounds analysis to support the claim that the FTA effects on trade flows are fragile
and unstable.

Canadian support for the CUSFTA was based primarily on its provision for bi-national review of US
antidumping procedures, a benefit not measurable by reduction of already low tariffs.

Bergstrand (2007) but varying across sectors. We use structural gravity to calculate the
effect of FTAs on buyers’ and sellers’ incidence and the associated sellers’ price changes
in 40 separate countries and an aggregate region consisting of 24 additional nations (none
of which entered FTAs).
The results show that the 1990’s FTA’s significantly increased real manufacturing
income of most economies in the world. 10 out of the 40 countries had terms of trade
gains greater than 5% while gains of 10% or more were enjoyed by Bulgaria, Hungary
and Poland. Losses were smaller than −0.2% and confined to countries that did not enter
into FTA’s: Australia, China, Korea and Japan (and the rest of the world aggregate).4
FTA’s change trade flows and thus, using the iceberg melting metaphor of gravity,
how much of the iceberg melts. The metaphor is quantified with an intuitive and novel
measure of the global efficiency of distribution averaged over all bilateral shipments in all
sectors. We apply the distance function (Deaton, 1979), itself an application of Debreu’s
coefficient of resource utilization (1951). The global efficiency of trade rises in each
manufacturing sector (ranging from 0.11% for Minerals to 2.1% for Textiles) with an
overall efficiency gain of 0.62%.
A NAFTA counter-factual experiment reveals large benefit to Mexico. Most of Mexico’s gains disappear if NAFTA is switched off, while without NAFTA the US and Canada
would have lost a little from the FTA inceptions in the rest of the global economy.
The terms of trade changes measured here are impact effects. Terms of trade will shift
further in a full general equilibrium analysis. We assume an endowments economy. Nonmanufactured goods are suppressed. These assumptions avoid building a complete general
equilibrium model, which would require taking a stand on specification and parameter
estimation of many dubious structural components. Standard implications of maximizing
behavior with substitution imply that our estimates are lower bounds of the real income
gains from FTA’s via terms of trade effects. We also assume no rents as part of the trade
4

The positive sum feature of these results, in contrast to the usual zero-sum implication of simple
trade policy theory, arises for two reasons. First, directly, less of the iceberg melts in bilateral shipments
between FTA partners due to a reduction in border frictions. Second, the change in all bilateral trade
flows at given border frictions can raise or lower the total amount melted. The results show that the
combination is positive, though in principle it need not be.

costs, hence we ignore the income effects of net revenue or rent changes due to the change
in trade policy. The no rent assumption avoids having to model many unobservable rents
while the observable tariff revenue changes are a very small part of the income changes,
as discussed further in Section 1.
Section 1 presents the theoretical foundation. Section 2 discusses the estimation of
the gravity equation and the trade volume effect of FTA’s. Section 3 presents the terms
of trade and global efficiency effects of switching on the FTA’s of the 1990’s in the base
year 1990. Section 4 concludes with some suggestions for further research.

Theoretical Foundation

Gravity’s empirical plausibility is based on goodness of fit: some 90% of the variation of
bilateral trade flows is explained. Structural gravity obtained credibility from clearing
up the border puzzle (Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003), while Anderson and Yotov
(2010b) show that structural gravity comes remarkably close to accurately representing
the data. We take this as justification to lean heavily on structural gravity theory to infer
terms of trade changes from the volume changes we estimate using Baier and Bergstrand’s
technique.
To avoid taking a stand on many features of the economy that are difficult to model
convincingly, we assume each country has an endowment vector of the manufacturing
goods for which we have data. We thus suppress substitutability in supply and we ignore
interaction with the rest of the economy. We assume that all manufactured goods are
intermediate, a convenient and common convention in the literature.
For further simplicity, we assume that no rents are associated with trade flows. All
trade costs and their changes are treated as ‘real’ in our setup. Thus we suppress tariff
revenues (which indeed are small for most goods and countries), quota rents (which
are large for some country pairs and product lines but notoriously hard to measure) and
monopoly rents associated with various trade barriers both formal and especially informal.
This procedure departs substantially from the theoretical literature on the welfare effects

4

of trade agreements, where the changes in rents play a key role. We do not believe that
rents and their changes are unimportant, but we do think that tariff revenues and their
changes are a small part of the rents and the non-tariff rents are extremely difficult to
measure.5 Efforts in this direction would distract from our focus on the terms of trade
without much assurance of being more realistic.
Goods are differentiated by place of origin within each goods class. Each goods class
forms a weakly separable group in demand with a Constant Elasticity of Substitution
(CES) aggregator cost function that is identical across countries. We interpret the goods
as intermediate inputs. Technological requirements at the upper, inter-sectoral, level are
for convenience represented by a Cobb-Douglas aggregator function, which translates into
P
constant expenditure shares αk , k αk = 1, across sectors within manufacturing.
The technology assumptions together with iceberg trade costs (distribution uses resources in the same proportion as production) imply trade separability: sellers’ prices
and consumer expenditures are affected only by the aggregate incidence of trade costs
in each sector, independent of the details of the distribution of sales or purchases across
trading partners. Buyers’ incidence falls on user prices while sellers’ incidence falls on
factory-gate prices.

Structural Gravity

Let pkij denote the price of origin i goods from class k for region j users. The arbitrage
k
k
condition implies pkij = p∗k
i tij , where tij ≥ 1 denotes the trade cost factor on shipment

of goods in class k from i to j, and p∗k
i is the factory-gate price at i. Effectively it is
as if goods melt away in distribution so that 1 unit shipped becomes 1/tkij < 1 units on
arrival.
Technology requirements for manufacturing inputs are represented by a globally common CES cost function for each goods class k. Cost minimizing users have expenditure
5

Anderson and van Wincoop (2002) perform a gravity model based simulation of NAFTA’s effects
where tariff revenue changes combine with terms of trade changes . Terms of trade changes are far more
important than revenue changes in the net welfare effects. That study points out that gravity does a far
better job of predicting the actual bilateral trade flow changes than did any of the CGE models surveyed.

Now consider the supply side and market clearance. The iceberg trade cost metaphor
implies that we can treat the value of shipments at end user prices, Yik for country i and
goods class k, as the product of the price at the factory gate p∗k
i times the endowment

(4)-(6) is the structural gravity model. Πki denotes outward multilateral resistance (OMR),
while Pjk denotes inward multilateral resistance (IMR).
Outward multilateral resistance is the average sellers’ incidence. It is as if each country

of Πki . (3) is interpreted as the market clearance condition for a hypothetical world market

Inward multilateral resistance in (6) is a CES index of bilateral buyers’ incidences
tkij /Πki . It is as if each country j bought its vector of class k goods from a single world
market facing demand side incidence of Pjk .
The equilibrium factory gate prices p∗k
i reflect the forces of supply and demand in
the global economy and also the sellers’ incidence of trade costs facing the entire global
economy, channeled through sellers’ incidence. Thus

Due to (3), p∗k
i is decreasing in Πi , a connection tying terms of trade effects of FTA’s

to the incidence analysis of the gravity model. In conditional general equilibrium with
given Yik ’s, the relationship is the simple inverse one given above: a fall in incidence raises
factory gate prices one for one. But in general equilibrium Yik /Y k is also a function of
the p∗ ’s and the solution for the p∗ ’s reflects supply and demand conditions and sellers’
incidence in all markets simultaneously.
7

The CES cost index for this hypothetical user in the world market is conventionally equal to 1 due
to summing (3) over i.

Incidence and Total Effects of Free Trade Agreements

The procedure in the existing literature for estimating FTA effects on bilateral trade flows
is to account for the presence of free trade agreements in the definition of the unobservable
trade costs, tkij , in the structural gravity equation (4). For a generic good, we define:
t1−σ
= eβ1 F T Aij +β2 ln DISTij +β3 BRDRij +β4 LAN Gij +β5 CLN Yij +
ij

P46

i=6

βi SM CT RYij

.

(7)

Here, F T Aij is an indicator variable for a free trade agreement between trading partners i and j. ln DISTij is the logarithm of bilateral distance. BRDRij , LAN Gij and
CLN Yij capture the presence of contiguous borders, common language and colonial ties,
respectively. Finally, we follow Anderson and Yotov (2010b) to define SM CT RYij as a
set of country-specific dummy variables equal to 1 when i = j and zero elsewhere, which
capture the effect of crossing the international border by shifting up internal trade, all
else equal.8
It is clear from system (4)-(6) that the direct effect of free trade agreements on bilateral trade flows, measured by β1 in (7), is only a fraction of the total FTA impact, which
includes two additional indirect effects. The first additional FTA effect is channeled
through the multilateral resistance terms. For given output and expenditures, system
(13)-(14) maps changes in bilateral trade costs to changes in the multilateral resistances.
Consequently, (4) reveals that any MR changes will affect bilateral trade flows. The
second indirect FTA effect on trade flows is channeled through output and expenditures,
which enter (4) directly, but also are structural elements in the construction of the multilateral resistance indexes. This indirect effect requires accounting for the FTA-driven
changes in output and expenditures at the upper level equilibrium. In sum, in order to
8

It should be noted that while controlling for internal trade has been ignored in the vast majority of
gravity estimates, the few studies that do include a variant of our SM CT RY covariate always estimate
large, positive and significant coefficient estimates on this dummy. For example, Wolf (2000) finds
evidence of US state border effects using aggregate shipments data. In the case of Canadian commodity
trade, Anderson and Yotov (2010a) find that internal provincial trade is higher than interprovincial and
international trade for 19 non-service sectors during the period 1992-2003. In a complementary study,
Anderson et al (2011) obtain similar estimates for Canadian service trade. Jensen and Yotov (2011)
estimate very large and significant SM CT RY impact for important agricultural commodities in the
world in 2001. Finally, Anderson and Yotov (2010b) estimate significant, country-specific SMCTRY
effects for 18 manufacturing sectors in the world (76 countries), 1990-2002.

estimate total FTA effects, one has to estimate FTA impact through the multilateral
resistances and through changes in output and expenditures, in addition to the direct
FTA effects on bilateral trade costs. We describe such a comprehensive procedure next.
As input to the evaluation, we estimate the tkij ’s with and without the FTA imposed
with panel methods. We take the initial year, pre-FTA, and choose units such that
k
p∗k
i = 1, ∀i, k. This implies that the endowments are observed from the initial Yi ’s. We

then solve the market clearance equations (10) given below for the implied distribution
parameters βik , ∀i, k. Due to homogeneity, the distribution parameters are only identified
P
up to a normalization, chosen here as i (βik )1−σk = 1.
To calculate the full effect of FTA’s we conduct the counter-factual experiment of
putting the FTA effect (using the tkij ’s from later years) into the base year with fixed
endowments. We find the set of factory gate prices and inward and outward multilateral
resistances that results. Once we know the p∗ ’s we can generate the Y ’s, the expenditures
(E’s) and the incidence variables, the P ’s and Π’s. The level of the incidence variables
is subject to the normalization of the βIk ’s, but their proportional change is invariant to
to the normalization.

There are NK equations in (10) and another NK in (11). As with any neoclassical
market clearing conditions, a normalization of prices is required because the system is
homogeneous of degree zero in the vector of factory gate prices. A natural normalization
is one that holds world real resources constant:

In (10)-(11), due to separability and homotheticity, only 2NK-K equations are linP k

National Gains Measures

Accounting for the effect of trade cost changes on manufacturing real income in this setup
is very simple. For each good in each country, there is a ‘factory gate’ price (unit cost
of production and distribution) p∗k
i in country i and product k. National manufacturing
P
k
k
income with multiple goods is given by k p∗k
i qi . Buyers in i face price indexes Pi for

goods class k. The user cost index for all goods is given by Ci = exp( k αk ln Pik ). Then

(16)

Ti is the ratio of the exact price index of exportable goods to the true cost of living index
of importable goods, satisfying the standard definition.
10

This solution is consistent with solving (13)-(14) for the supply and expenditure shares implied by
the solution p∗ ’s and normalizing the Π’s by

k 1−σk
‘world’ consumer with CES preferences, resulting in Yik /Y k = (βik p∗k
where the hypothetical
i Πi )
CES global price index is equal to 1.

11

The effect on real manufacturing income in country i from a switch from No FTA
(denoted with superscript 0) to FTA (denoted with superscript F ) can be evaluated
by computing the proportional real income change with the ratio RiF /Ri0 , equal to the
proportionate change in the terms of trade TiF /Ti0 .11

1.4

World Efficiency Measures

World efficiency can be evaluated by further exploiting implications of the structural
gravity model. The iceberg melting metaphor is extended to a scalar aggregate using
the interpretation of outward multilateral resistance as aggregate sellers incidence and
inward multilateral resistance as buyers’ incidence. Global aggregate sellers’ incidence is
interpreted as global aggregate shrinkage due to ‘melting’ prior to arrival on the ‘world’
market. Global aggregate buyers’ incidence is interpreted as the further melting due to
shipment from the ‘world’ market to its various destinations. This natural measure of
the FTA-induced change in the global efficiency of distribution is an application of Debreu’s (1951) coefficient of resource utilization as specialized in Deaton’s (1979) distance
function.
The endowment of world resources is the vector {q k ≡

P

k
i qi }.

In equilibrium, only

a fraction of the endowment arrives at the hypothetical ‘world’ market for sellers to
exchange with buyers because some melts away in shipment to the ‘world’ market. A
further nationally varying fraction melts away as the buyers ship their ‘world’ market
purchases to their destinations. The aggregate sellers (across origins) and buyers (across

A more formal treatment using the GDP function clarifies the relationship between our approach
focused on the manufacturing sectors and a full analysis of all sectors. Let the maximum value GDP
function be denoted g(π, p∗ , P, v) for a generic country, where π denotes the tradable goods price vector
in the rest of the economy, p∗ the factory gate manufacturing price vector and P the manufacturing
input price vector. Differentiating GDP with respect to the manufacturing prices and using Hotelling’s
and Shephard’s Lemmas, the proportional rate of change of GDP is

where wk = Y k / k Y k and ω k = E k / k E k . The square bracket term on the right hand side is the
percentage change in the terms of trade. It is multiplied by the importance of manufacturing in GDP, a
scaling factor we disregard. The second term on the right is equal to zero under balanced trade. While
this is not generally true for any subset of sectors, the normal convention is to impose it when all sectors
are included, so we suppress this term in our treatment. Equation (16) follows by integrating the square
bracket under the restrictions of fixed q’s and a Cobb-Douglas cost function C for input prices.

In the initial situation (without FTA’s for example) the factory gate prices in (17)
are all equal to one, yielding aggregate sellers incidence Πk0 . Bringing in the new trade
costs (the FTA’s) induces new p∗ ’s and new Π’s, and hence new aggregate effective

neatly decomposable into sellers’ efficiency change Π0 /ΠF times buyers’ efficiency change

Figure 1 illustrates (21) for the case of two goods classes. E is the endowment point.
The line with slope equal to minus 1 through E denotes the initial value of the world

consumption vectors c1 , c2 satisfying f (c1 , c2 ) = f (q 1 /Π1,0 P 1,0 , q 2 /Π2,0 P 2,0 ) = f 0 . The
efficiency of the initial equilibrium is given by the radial contraction along ray OE from
E to point A that gives the same level of output of the composite input as the actual
effective consumption at C. Thus 1/ΠP = OA/OE. Point F denotes the FTA equilibrium effective consumption q 1 /Π1F P 1,F , q 2 /Π2F P 2,F . The isoquant associated with point
F cuts ray OE at D, with efficiency measure OD/OE. The proportionate efficiency change

To obtain econometrically sound estimates of the parameters of interest from equation
(22), we address the following challenges: presence of zero trade flows; heteroskedasticity

15

in trade flows data; endogeneity of free trade agreements; and, unobservable multilateral
resistance terms. To utilize the information carried by the zero trade flows and to account
for heteroskedasticity in trade flows data, we resort to the Poisson pseudo-maximumlikelihood (PPML) estimator advocated by Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (2007) who argue
that the truncation of trade flows at zero biases the standard log-linear OLS approach.
In addition, they show that not accounting for heteroskedasticity in the log-linear OLS
regressions produces inconsistent coefficient estimates.12
Following the developments in the empirical gravity literature, we use time-varying,
directional (source and destination), country-specific dummies to control for the multilateral resistances.13 To account for FTA endogeneity, we use the panel data estimation
techniques described in Wooldridge (2002) and first applied to a similar setting by Baier
and Bergstrand (2007), who employ aggregate data to show that direct FTA effects on
bilateral trade flows can be consistently isolated in a theoretically-founded gravity model
by using country-pair fixed effects. Alternatively, Baier and Bergstrand (2007) argue
that consistent FTA estimates can be obtained with first-differenced panel data, which
eliminates the pair fixed effects.14
Taking all of the above considerations into account, we use the PPML technique
to estimate the following econometric specification for each class of commodities in our
12
Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2008) (HMR) propose an alternative approach. They develop a
formal model of selection to account for the zero trade flows, where exporters must absorb some fixed
costs to enter a market. They use religion as an exogenous variable that enters selection but is excluded
from determination of the volume of trade. We choose not to use HMR, partly because of doubts about
the exclusion restriction and partly because of doubts about the importance of fixed costs in light of
evidence in Besedes and Prusa (2006a,b) that highly disaggregated bilateral US trade flickers on and
off. Anderson and Yotov (2010b) show that HMR and PPML as well as OLS give essentially the same
bilateral trade costs after normalization.
13
Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) use custom programming to account for the multilateral resistances in a static setting. Feenstra (2004) advocates the directional, country-specific fixed effects
approach. To estimate the effects of the Canadian Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), Anderson and
Yotov (2010a) use panel data with time-varying, directional (source and destination), country-specific
fixed effects. Olivero and Yotov (2011) formalize their econometric treatment of the MR terms in a
dynamic gravity setting.
14
The issue of FTA endogeneity is not new to the trade literature (see Trefler 1993, for example).
However, primarily due to the lack of reliable instruments, standard instrumental variable (IV) treatments
of endogeneity in cross-sectional settings have not been successful in addressing the problem. See for
example Magee (2003) and Baier and Bergstrand (2002, 2004b). Baier and Bergstrand (2007) summarize
the findings from these studies as “at best mixed evidence of isolating the effect of FTAs on trade flows.”

∀k. (23)

Here, Xij is bilateral trade (in levels) between partners i and j at time t.15 F T Aij,t is an
indicator variable that takes a value of one if at time t countries i and j are members of the
same free trade agreement. ηi,t denotes the time-varying source-country dummies, which
control for the (log of) outward multilateral resistances and total shipments. θj,t encompasses the time varying destination country dummy variables that account for the (log
of) inward multilateral resistances and total expenditure. γij captures the country-pair
fixed effects used to address FTA endogeneity. Time-invariant γij ’s are justified because
Anderson and Yotov (2010b) find essentially time-invariant gravity coefficients from the
same data, a pattern found by others dubbed the mystery of the missing globalization.
Following Baier and Bergstrand (2007) we specify the FTA volume effects,the β’s, to
be uniform (as opposed to varying by FTA) and we allow for gradual phasing-in of the
free trade agreement effects by including FTA lags in specification (23). The reason for
the former is that, due to the rich fixed effects structure of our econometric specification
and the small variability in any individual FTA indicators, we cannot identify separately
the effects of specific FTAs. The reason for the latter is that private agents in the trading
partners gradually adjust to the new economic conditions under a recently implemented
FTA. From an econometric perspective, allowing for phasing-in adds a time dimension
(in addition to the commodity, country, and producer and consumer dimensions) to the
data sets of welfare effects that we construct in the next section.
Finally, as noted by Cheng and Wall (2005), “Fixed-effects estimations are sometimes
criticized when applied to data pooled over consecutive years on the grounds that depen15

In a static setting, (4) implies that income and expenditure elasticities of bilateral trade flows are
unitary and, therefore, size-adjusted trade is the natural dependent variable. Bringing output and
expenditures on the left-hand side has the additional advantage of controlling for endogeneity of these
variables. Using aggregate data however, Frankel (1997) shows that the bias due to GDP endogeneity is
insignificant. In addition, Olivero and Yotov (2011) show that income and expenditure elasticities are
not necessarily equal to one in a dynamic setting, such as the one that we employ here to account for
FTA endogeneity. Thus, in addition to accounting for the unobserved multilateral resistances, the fixed
effects in our estimations will also absorb country-specific output and expenditures.

dent and independent variables cannot fully adjust in a single year’s time.” (p.8). To
avoid this critique, we use only the years 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002. This implies that
F T Aij,t−1 and F T Aij,t−2 are four-year and eight-year lags, respectively.

2.2

Data Description

This study covers the period 1990-2002 for a total of 41 trading partners including 40
separate countries and the rest of the world (ROW), consisting of 24 additional nations.16
None of the countries included in ROW are part of any FTAs with countries in the main
sample during the period of investigation.17 There are four nations however (Australia,
China, Japan, and South Korea), that are treated separately, even though they did not
enter any FTA between 1990 and 2002. We use these countries (outsiders), along with
the aggregate ROW region, to gauge FTA effects on non-members. The commodities
covered include manufacturing production classified according to the United Nations’
2-digit International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 2.18
To estimate gravity and to calculate the indexes of interest, we use industry-level
data on bilateral trade flows and output, and we construct expenditures, subject to our
structural model, for each trading partner and each commodity class, all measured in
thousands of current US dollars for the corresponding year.19 In addition, we use data
16

The 40 countries are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Bolivia, Brazil,
Canada, Switzerland, Chile, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Germany, Denmark, Ecuador, Spain, Finland,
France, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Rep., Mexico,
Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, Uruguay, United
States. The rest of the world includes Cameroon, Cyprus, Egypt Arab Rep., Hong Kong, Indonesia, India,
Iran Islamic Rep., Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Sri Lanka, Macao, Malta, Myanmar, Malawi, Malaysia, Niger,
Nepal, Philippines, Senegal, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago, Tanzania, South Africa.
17
The ROW aggregation is to ease estimation by limiting the very large number of fixed effects.
18
The nine 2-digit ISIC manufacturing categories are (short labels, used for convenience throughout
the paper, are reported in parentheses): 31. Food, Beverages, and Tobacco Products (Food); 32. Textile,
Apparel, and Leather Products (Textile); 33. Wood and Wood Products (Wood); 34. Paper and Paper
Products (Paper); 35. Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber, and Plastic Products (Chemicals); 36. Other
Non-metallic Products (Minerals); 37. Basic Metal Industries (Metals); 38. Fabricated Metal Products,
Machinery, Equipment (Machinery); 39. Other manufacturing. Inspection of the output data at the
3-digit and 4-digit ISIC level of aggregation reveals that many countries report Equipment production,
and especially Scientific Equipment production, under the category Other Manufacturing. Therefore, to
avoid inconsistencies, we combine the last two 2-digit categories into one, which we label Machinery.
19
Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) discuss in length the implications of inappropriate deflation of nominal
trade values, which they call “the bronze-medal mistake” in gravity estimations. Their most preferred
econometric specification is one with un-deflated trade values, bilateral fixed effects, and time-varying
country dummies, which, in addition to accounting for the multilateral resistances in a dynamic setting, will “also eliminate any problems arising from the incorrect deflation of trade.” The structural

substitution, and the presence of regional free trade agreements.
Summary statistics for the main estimation variables (described below) for the first
and the last year in the sample as well as data sources and description of all other variables
employed in our estimations and analysis are presented in the Supplementary Appendix
accompanying this manuscript.20 Here, we just describe the two data sources that we use
to construct the main explanatory variable, an indicator regressor capturing the presence
of FTAs. Most of the data are from the FTA dataset constructed by Baier and Bergstrand
(2007), which we update with data on some additional agreements and years from the
World Trade Organization (WTO) web site.21 Following Baier and Bergstrand (2007),
we only consider full FTAs and customs unions that entered into force during the period
of investigation, 1990-2002. Table 1 lists the trade agreements included in our sample in
chronological order.

2.3

Gravity Estimation Results

Panel PPML estimates of equation (23), obtained with bilateral dummies and timevarying, directional, fixed effects, and accounting for FTA phasing in, are reported in
the second panel, labeled ‘First Stage’, of Table 2. Free trade agreements have positive,
and economically and statistically significant impact on bilateral trade flows between
member countries.22 There is phasing-in of the FTA effects, which are spread relatively
evenly over time. The two exceptions are ‘Wood and Wood Products’ and ‘Paper and
Paper Products’. Allowing for phasing-in reveals that bilateral trade flows in these two
categories require some time to adjust to the implementation of free trade agreements.
In each case, the coefficient on the second four-year lag FTA dummy, L2.FTA, is positive
interpretation of the time-varying, country-specific, directional fixed effects (FEs) in our setting is a
combination of the multilateral resistance terms and the trading partners output and expenditures. It
is easy to see how the FEs would also absorb any deflator indexes, exchange rates, etc. Thus, the realand nominal-trade estimates should be identical.

22
‘Paper and Paper Products’ is the only category for which the initial FTA effect is negative and
marginally statistically significant, however very small in magnitude.

19

and economically and statistically significant.23
FTA effects on bilateral trade at the commodity level are relatively persistent, however, there is no clear evidence of time trends. For some categories, such as ‘Textile,
Apparel, and Leather Products’ and ‘Food, Beverages, and Tobacco Products’, there
is a large initial effect followed by a gradual decrease. For other categories, such as
‘Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber, and Plastic Products’, the initial FTA effect is
relatively small and it increases over time. Finally, there is no clear time trend for ‘Basic
Metal Products’ and ‘Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery, and Equipment’. Estimates
from row ‘L2.F T A’ indicate that, for most commodities, the FTA effects are still strong
nine years after their entry into force. With one exception, all point estimates of the
second four-year lag of the FTA dummy are positive and economically and statistically
significant. The only exception (with positive but small and not statistically significant
estimate) is ‘Food, Beverages, and Tobacco’. This suggests that FTA effects for all or
part of the products in this category are short-lived.
Row ‘F T A T OT AL’ of Table 2 reports the total FTA effects obtained by summing
the values from the first three rows for each product. Standard errors are obtained with
the Delta method. All estimates are positive and statistically significant. There is significant variability (within reasonable bounds) in the average treatment FTA effect across
different products. The effect is weaker for commodity categories such as ‘Wood and
Wood Products’, ‘Paper and Paper Products’, and ‘Non-metallic Products’, and stronger
for categories such as ‘Textile, Apparel, and Leather Products’, ‘Basic Metal Industries’,
and ‘Fabricated Metal Products, Machinery, and Equipment’. These estimates of disaggregated direct FTA effects are in line with findings from related studies that used
aggregated data. Varying between 0.286 (for Wood) and 1.291 (for Textiles), our numbers have central tendency comparable to the FTA average treatment effect estimate of
0.76 from Baier and Bergstrand (2007) and to the ATE effect of 0.94 from Rose (2004).
23
Panel estimates obtained without lags (available by request) reveal that ‘Wood and Wood Products’
and ‘Paper and Paper Products’ are the only two product categories for which the average FTA treatment
effects over the whole period 1990-2002 are not significant. The fact that some average estimates show
insignificant, while some of their phasing-in components are significant, reinforces our (and Baier and
Bergstrand’s, 2007) preferred approach to allow for gradual FTA entering into force.

20

To calculate tij ’s, we adopt a two-step procedure that allows us to simultaneously
estimate bilateral trade costs including internal trade costs.24 First, we estimate the panel
gravity model (23) using the PPML estimator with time-varying, source and destination
fixed effects. Next, we re-estimate while imposing the first stage estimated coefficients
{βbi , ηbit , θbjt } and replacing the bilateral fixed effects with a regression on the standard
time-invariant gravity covariates:

Xij = exp[βˆ0 + βˆ1 F T Aij,t + βˆ2 F T Aij,t−1 + βˆ3 F T Aij,t−2 + γ1 ln DISTij + γ2 BRDRij +
γ3 LAN Gij + γ4 CLN Yij +

Then, we use the obtained estimates and actual data on the gravity variables to construct
a complete set of power transforms of bilateral trade costs that do not capture the presence
of FTAs:

Provided that the FTA estimates are unbiased (which is ensured by the panel data treat24

One possibility to calculate the tij ’s is to use the estimates of the bilateral fixed effects from specification (23) in combination with the FTA effects:
t̂1−σ

where β̂ij is constructed by adding up horizontally the estimates of the country-pair fixed effects. β̂f ta ,
β̂l.f ta , and β̂l2.f ta are the estimates of the current, lagged, and two-period lagged FTA effects, respectively.
This approach cannot obtain internal trade costs tii ’s because perfect collinearity does not allow for
separate identification of the fixed effect estimates β̂ii ’s for individual countries in model (23). Another
approach that simultaneously obtains consistent gravity estimates (that can be used to construct bilateral
trade costs) and unbiased FTA estimates, is to regress the estimates of the bilateral fixed effects from (23)
on the set of standard gravity variables. In analysis available by request, we improve on Cheng and Wall
(2005) by using variance weighted least squares to obtain unbiased gravity estimates from the bilateral
fixed effects. However, the same critique (not being able to identify internal trade costs separately for
each country) applies here as well.

is a good proxy for the time-invariant trade costs (as ac-

trade costs.
Without going into details, we briefly interpret the estimates of (25), which are presented in the top panel, labeled ‘Second Stage’, of Table 2.25 All estimates of the effects
of bilateral distance on bilateral trade flows are negative and significant. The variability
of the estimates across commodities reflects the influence of value/weight on transportation costs. Common borders facilitate trade. Without any exception, the estimates of
the coefficients on BRDR are large, positive and significant. The estimated coefficient on
LANG is positive and significant for only five of the eight product categories, in contrast
to previous findings on aggregated trade. A possible explanation for this result is that
over the past quarter-century, manufactures trade has grown between North and South,
enhanced by the vertical disintegration of manufacturing, both weakening the influence
of common language relative to its effect on aggregate trade found in previous studies.
Notably, the largest estimate on LANG is for Paper, which can be explained with the
fact that this category includes ‘Printing and Publishing Products’ whose consumption
requires knowledge of a specific language. The role of colonial ties in explaining bilateral
trade flows in our analysis is low relative to earlier studies on aggregate data. Six of the
eight estimates are positive and significant, marginally so in the case of Minerals. Using
more disaggregated data, Anderson and Yotov (2010b) find even weaker evidence of the
effects of colonial ties. Home bias in trade is captured by the large, positive, and significant estimates on SMCTRY. These numbers are obtained as weighted averages across
all regions in the sample. Individual, country-specific estimates are available by request.
The variation of the SMCTRY estimates is intuitive across goods. In particular, the estimates on Food and Paper, which includes ‘Printing and Publishing Products’, are among
the largest, while the estimates on Textiles and Machinery, industries with clear patterns
of international specialization, are among the smallest.
Overall, the results from Table 2 are convincing. Aggregate estimations with similar

properties have been interpreted as strong evidence in support of gravity theory and
used to construct aggregate bilateral trade costs. Similarly, the set of standard gravity
covariates and the commodity level estimates derived here can be used to construct a
reasonable measure of disaggregated bilateral trade costs.

Real Income Effects of FTA’s

Using the theory of Section 1 and the inferred trade costs of Section 2 we calculate the
terms of trade and global efficiency effects of the FTAs that entered into force between
1990 and 2002. We also analyze the counter-factual experiment of switching off NAFTA.

3.1

Terms of Trade Effects

The effects on the sellers and the buyers in each country are reported separately and
combined into the change in the terms of trade. Finally, we present the global efficiency
measures.
Most of the indexes reported here are at the country- and commodity-level and are
consistently aggregated from country-commodity pair numbers. The latter are available
by request. In addition, to gauge the significance of our indexes, we calculate standard
errors by bootstrapping the original FTA estimates. In particular, we first generate 100
sets of bootstrapped PPML gravity estimates of (23), which we use to calculate 100 sets
of each of the indexes of interest. Then we calculate standard errors according to:

FTA Effects on Sellers. We use factory-gate prices, p∗ ’s, to measure FTA effects on

By construction, all p∗ ’s for 1990 are equal to one. The numbers for each of the
other three years in our sample (1994, 1998 and 2002) take into account the presence
and phasing-in of all free trade agreements that entered into force between 1990 and
2002. We use sectoral output shares as weights to obtain country-level estimates of the
factory-gate prices. The numbers in columns 1-3 of Table 3 are percentage changes in
prices calculated using the phased-in FTA’s for the three years shown. These sellers’ price
changes measure FTA general equilibrium incidence on the producers in each country.
There is wide variability in the FTA effects on producers. More than one third of
the world’s producers suffer losses, while the rest enjoy gains. The gains for the winners
might be at the expense of the losers. Five of the six biggest losers are the regions that did
not enter any FTAs during the 90’s. Nevertheless, producer losses are relatively small.
26

See the Data Appendix for description and further details on these numbers. In principle, both the
σk ’s and the βik ’s can be estimated from the structural gravity model. The estimate of the elasticity of
substitution arises as the coefficient on tariffs in the gravity model. Due to the lack of reliable sectoral
tariff data for the period of investigation however, we choose to use the numbers from Broda et al (2006).
The βik ’s can also be constructed from gravity, each of them as combination of the exporters’ fixed effects.
We experimented with those estimates and we obtain initial factory-gate prices that are close to one but
not exactly equal to one. Thus, for general equilibrium consistency we chose the method described in
the text.

24

Japan, China and S. Korea register the largest losses of more than 0.5%, followed by
Chile, ROW and Australia with similar losses. Trade diversion explains why losers lose,
while the gainers gains are partly due to the shift from the losers and partly due to a
direct benefit of lower trade costs due to the FTA — in effect a transfer from nature.
Even though, our sample of outsiders is small, it is tempting to note that producers in
the bigger outside regions suffer more.
Interestingly, the next group of countries where producers suffer most from FTAs’
are developed nations, including US and Canada. We attribute the negative effects on
US and Canadian producers to NAFTA, even though both countries entered other FTAs
during the period of investigation as well. Producers in other developed nations suffered
minor losses too. The losses for the developed countries are across all sectors but are
more pronounced in sectors such as Textile, Apparel, and Leather Products (Textile) and
Basic Metal Industries (Metals).
The biggest winners from the integration of the 90’s are producers from relatively
small European and Latin American economies that signed FTAs with large trading
partners. From the European economies, Poland and Hungary are leaders with producer
gains of 7.3% and 5.5%, respectively, followed by Bulgaria with 5.3% increase in producer prices and Romania with 3.9%. Membership to the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and, consequently,
to the European Union (EU) should explain the strong positive effects in these nations.
The large gains for these countries come at the expense of other EU members. This is
supported by the small losses for the producers in the larger European economies.
Of the Latin American countries, Mexican producers are the biggest winners with
3.3% increase in their factory-gate prices. Combined with the fact that US and Canada
are among the countries with FTA producer losses, this result suggests that NAFTA has
benefitted Mexican producers disproportionately, at the expense of producers in the other
two partners. The counterfactual exercise of switching off NAFTA (described in Section
3.3) shows that NAFTA is the main reason for the gains to Mexican producers, despite
a series of bilateral FTAs as well as agreements between Mexico and most of the other

25

Latin American economies.
FTA Effects on Buyers. FTA effects on buyers in the world are reported in columns 46 of Table 3. Country-level indexes are obtained by aggregating the country-commodity
numbers with sectoral-level expenditure shares used as weights. The numbers in each
column are percentage changes in the inward multilateral resistances for the base year
calculated with and without FTA’s. Column ‘%∆02’ captures the total effects over the
period 1990-2002 because the 2002 bilateral trade costs (used in the construction of the
2002 IMRs) account for the cumulative, direct FTA impact.
Without exception, buyers in the world benefitted from the integration of the 90’s with
benefits increasing over time. Importantly, even buyers in nations that did not enter any
free trade agreement during the period of investigation enjoy lower prices.27 All five such
regions in our sample (Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and ROW) register small
IMR decreases, though not the smallest in the sample. Another interesting example is
Morocco. This country did not enter any FTAs until 2000, yet it enjoyed IMR, though
economically insignificant, falls in 1994 and in 1998. The gains increased significantly
in 2002 following Morocco’s FTA with the European Union in 2000. The intuition is
positive spill-over effects: producers in nations that entered FTAs enjoy efficiency gains
in distribution that are passed on to all their trading partners, including the ones with
whom they have no FTAs.
The variability of the FTA effects on buyers across countries is wide and the pattern
makes good intuitive sense for the most part. The biggest FTA winners are relatively
small countries that are geographically close to their major markets. Thus the largest FTA
gains are for some small European economies including Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria. A
partial additional explanation is that liberalization-induced trade cost reductions occurred
prior to the FTA because all these nations are founding members of the Central European
Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and each of them signed an agreement with, first, the
27

By definition, the IMR values in principle are comparable to price indexes, and in particular their
variation across countries might be expected to reflect variation in consumer (or user) price indexes across
regions. The IMR’s have more variation than CPI’s, and we expect that they only loosely track variations
in consumer price indexes. A possible explanation is that the inward incidence of trade costs probably
falls on intermediate goods users in a way that does not show up in measured prices. In addition, by
construction, the IMRs capture the home bias in preferences that cannot show up in prices.

26

European Free Trade Association, and then with the European Union. Romania follows
a similar integration pattern and also registers significant buyer gains.
Buyers in many of the Latin American countries are in the upper tail of the FTA gains’
distribution too. Bolivia is the leader with consumer gains of more than 5%. Uruguay and
Mexico follow closely with more than 4% gains. Chile, Ecuador and Argentina also enjoy
significant buyer gains. All these nations are members of the Latin American Free Trade
Agreement (LAFTA), since 1993. In addition, most of these countries are (founding)
members of Mercosur and have FTAs with each other. Finally, NAFTA and series of
bilateral FTAs between Mexico and other countries may contribute to the positive effects
for this particular country.28 Another country that enjoys large buyer gains is Tunisia.
The explanation is this nation’s FTA with the EU in 1998. Note that in 1994, Tunisia
experiences only very small gains from the integration taking place in the rest of the
world.
Buyers in most of the developed economies enjoy moderate FTA gains. This is in
accordance with the classical trade theory prediction of smaller gains from freer trade for
the larger trading partners. Finally, we find that buyers in the five regions that were not
involved in any trade agreement initiated between 1990 and 2002 are among the regions
in the lower half of the distribution of gains from globalization taking place in the rest of
the world.
Terms of Trade Indexes. We combine buyer and seller indexes for each country and
year in our sample to obtain terms of trade (ToT) numbers and their percentage changes
due to FTAs as:
TiF
− 1, ∀i
Ti0

(30)

where Tit is defined by (16) evaluated at FTA (t = F ) and initial (t = 0) prices. Ti
decomposes into the seller price and buyer price multiplicative components reported sep28

When interpreting our results, the reader should remember that the equilibrium welfare effects in
each country are generated in response to the impact of all FTAs in our sample. While it is probably
true that the strongest FTA effect on Mexico comes from NAFTA, the model allows for any other FTA
to also influence the welfare of Mexican consumers and producers, even if Mexico is not part of the FTA
at all. This is why we observe welfare effects for the countries that did not participate in any free trade
agreement initiated between 1990 and 2002.

27

arately and multiplicatively combined in the last three columns of Table 3.29 The only
regions whose terms of trade worsen during the the 90’s are the ones that did not enter
any FTA. Even though buyers in these regions enjoyed small FTA gains, integration in
the rest of the world had a stronger negative impact on sellers. Second, all countries
that entered FTAs during the 90’s enjoy real income (ToT) gains. This suggests that (i)
the direct FTA effects among trading partners dominates the indirect FTA effect from
ongoing regional integration in the rest of the world, and (ii) the losses for the producers
in larger FTA members are dominated by consumer gains at the national level.
Third, the three nations with the largest ToT improvement during the 90s (of more
than 10%) include Poland, Hungar and Bulgaria. Tunisia is close behind with a ToT improvement of almost 10%. The next geographical group of countries that have benefitted
enormously from globalization are some Latin American Nations including Mexico, with
gains of 7.6% and Uruguay and Bolivia with gains of more than 6%. It should be noted
that Mexican producers gain more than producers in Uruguay and Bolivia, but the gains
for consumers in the latter two nations are larger. Finally, as expected, large nations
benefit less from FTAs. Thus, almost all developed economies are ordered in the lower
tail of the distribution of ToT increases.30 However, it is important to emphasize that all
FTA members enjoy some gains. For example, even though US and Canadian producers
suffered losses (probably due to NAFTA) their buyers gain more. In sum, our findings
suggest that the integration of the 90’s benefitted FTA members while hurting outsiders
by an amount too small to be noticeable.

3.2

Global Efficiency Effects

To calculate global efficiency indexes (first at the commodity level and then at the world
level), first, we obtain aggregates of the outward multilateral resistances (presented and
described in the Supplementary Appendix) and of the inward multilateral resistances
(discussed above) across all countries. Then, as described in the theoretical section,
we construct efficiency measures for each year in our sample. Efficiency estimates are
29
30

The buyers’ and sellers’ price changes do not sum to the ToT because the changes are discrete.
Austria is an exception with total gains of 7.9%, which fall mostly on the consumer side.

28

reported in Table 4. The first eight rows of the table report global sectoral indexes and
the last row presents the global efficiency measure for world manufacturing in each year.
The last column of the table presents the total efficiency changes caused by FTAs during
the whole period of investigation.
As can be seen from column ‘%∆2002’, without any exception, all of the sectors in our
sample enjoy statistically significant efficiency gains and there is wide variability across
industries. The largest effect is for Textiles, where we estimate an efficiency gain due
to FTAs of more than 2 percent. Metals also register a large gain of close to 1%. Food
follows with gains of close to 0.7%. The sectors with smallest efficiency gains are Paper
and Minerals. A possible explanation for these results is that Paper and Minerals are the
sectors with largest SMCTRY estimates, indicating bias toward domestic consumption,
while Textiles, for example, is the industry with the lowest SMCTRY estimate. Interestingly however, even though Food had one of the largest estimates of the coefficient on
internal trade, we find this sector to experience relatively large efficiency gains.
The sectoral level efficiency measures combine to a global efficiency index for the
world of 0.62%, which is driven by the large combined share of Food, Textiles and Metals
in world manufacturing. It is also interesting to note that for each sector, as well as
for global manufacturing, we see that the FTA numbers presented in Table 4 increase
over time. In fact we estimate small efficiency losses for Paper in 1994 and 1998 and for
Minerals in 1994. In sum, the indexes presented here reveal significant efficiency gains
due to the FTAs that entered into force between 1990 and 2002. In addition, we provide
evidence that the global efficiency FTA effects are persistent over time in most sectors.

3.3

Counterfactual Experiments

The framework of this paper is now applied to isolate the effects of a particular free trade
agreement (NAFTA) as well as the impact of all FTAs signed by a specific nation (Mexico).31 The choice of NAFTA and Mexico, respectively, for counterfactual experiments
31

These FTAs include LAFTA/LAIA (1993) and series of bilateral agreements between Mexico and
other partners including Bolivia (1995), Costa Rica (1995), Columbia (1995) (As part of the Group of
Three. The third country, Venezuela, is not in the sample), the EU (2000), and Israel (2000).

29

seems natural as both have been objects of interest for an extensive literature.32
First, we estimate a hypothetical set of multilateral resistances, factory-gate prices
and corresponding FTA ToT effects as if there is no NAFTA (but all other FTAs are
still in place). Then, we shut down the rest of the Mexican free trade agreements and we
estimate the effects from globalization happening elsewhere in the world.
Table 5 presents our findings. For brevity, we only report the changes in the total
welfare (ToT) effects. The numbers in Columns 1 of the table are the indexes from the last
column of Table 3, capturing total welfare effects from all FTAs that entered into force
during the period of investigation. Column 2 reports welfare effects without NAFTA. The
estimates are revealing. First, we find that NAFTA benefits all members, but most of
all Mexico. We estimate a staggering fall in the ToT gains for Mexico. NAFTA accounts
for more than 82% percent of the gains from all Mexican FTAs. Canada and the US
benefit from NAFTA too, but the real income gains for these countries are significantly
smaller, less than 0.1% each. These results are in accordance with findings from series
of computationally intensive CGE models.33 Second, our estimates indicate that without
NAFTA both Canada and US will actually suffer from integration taking place in the rest
of the world during the period of investigation. Note, for example, that the welfare effect
for Canada becomes negative after the removal of NAFTA, even though this country has
bilateral FTAs with Chile and Bolivia. This suggests that (i) either the direct effects
of these two FTA’s on Canadian producers are negative and outweigh consumer gains,
or (ii) that the effects of globalization elsewhere dominate the direct Canada-Chile and
Canada-Bolivia FTA effects.
Third, the hypothetical removal of NAFTA has small impact on other countries
32

Our framework can be applied to study series of other interesting counterfactual experiments including global free trade, switch on FTAs for all bilaterals i 6= j, or a 1% fall in trade barriers for all
bilaterals i 6= j. Another area where our methods can lead to potentially very important contributions is
in providing much needed empirical evidence on whether regionalism is a stumbling block or a stepping
stone toward global free trade. See the concluding section for more interesting applications.
33
Our estimate of the welfare gains for Mexico from NAFTA falls comfortably within the range of
corresponding CGE indexes. The majority of these numbers are in the 5%-6% range, but some studies
predict 11% welfare gains by the year 2000 (see McLeery, 1992) and even 14% by 2003 (see Klein and
Salvatore, 1995). See Brown et al. (1992a) for a concise summary of the findings from leading CGE
models regarding the welfare implications of NAFTA.

30

too.34 According to our estimates, most non-NAFTA members would enjoy small gains if
NAFTA were not there. The natural explanation is trade diversion toward the large US
market, which no longer is served ‘freely’ by Mexico and Canada. However, we also see
some outside nations suffering from the removal of NAFTA. Chile, for example, registers
small ToT losses. The explanation might again be trade diversion in the form of increased
Mexican presence in the Latin American markets.
In a final experiment all FTAs in which Mexico took part during the period of investigation are shut down. The resulting changes in the national terms of trade indexes are
reported in column 3 of Table 5. Several properties stand out: (a) Mexico is the country
that suffers the largest welfare loss. The total FTA welfare effects for this country become
negative. If not involved in integration, Mexico would have suffered a minor (0.06%) decrease in its terms of trade and manufacturing real GDP due to the FTAs happening
elsewhere in the world. (b) All other Latin American countries also experience (often
significant) welfare losses due to the removal of the FTA relations that they have with
Mexico.35 Most of the Latin American countries, however, still enjoy positive FTA welfare effects, probably due to the strong FTA connections among themselves. Costa Rica
is the only exception with negative terms of trade changes. (c) Some (more developed)
economies in Europe also suffer mild welfare losses. This implies that the direct effects of
the removal of the FTA between Mexico and the European Union dominate the indirect
(trade diversion) effects from the removal of the rest of the Mexican FTAs (but NAFTA).

Conclusion

The numbers presented in this paper portray a regional integration process in the 1990’s
that increased efficiency in each manufacturing sector and in the global economy overall,
provided many integrating partners with substantial gains and inflicted small losses on
a few countries that did not enter FTA’s. The methods developed and the numbers
34

The small effects on the rest of the world are in accordance with the conclusions from Brown et al.
(1992b).
35
Note that some of those countries would have benefitted from the removal of NAFTA. Probably due
to trade diversion.

31

calculated here should be useful for many other purposes.
Our results include a multi-dimensional (country, commodity, and time) data set of
producer price, terms of trade and global efficiency indexes that can be used to test
numerous predictions from the theoretical literature on trade liberalization. Preliminary
investigation indicates that larger FTA gains are associated with larger number of FTA
partners and larger increase in the volume of trade caused by FTAs. In addition, FTA
real income gains are inversely related to relative country size and to pre-FTA volumes
of trade. These relationships accord with stylized theoretical trade predictions, and open
avenues for future empirical work.
The paper offers new methods for analyzing the international externality effects of
many policy changes. These can shed light on whether regionalism is a stumbling block
or a stepping stone toward global free trade. Terms of trade externalities also arise
from policies other than FTA’s or other trade policies. Future work on domestic policy
changes that affect internal trade costs relative to international ones (such as China’s
massive infrastructure investments), affect supplier costs and volume or buyer costs and
volume (such as carbon emissions controls) can readily be examined within this framework. Analysis of intra-national vs. inter-national policies yields important insights (see
for example Anderson and Yotov, 2010a).
The simplicity, tractability, and predictive power of the structural gravity model make
it an attractive complement to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) simulation models. The general equilibrium structure of distribution naturally nests inside typical CGE
structures, pointing the way toward a better combination of empirical and simulation
modeling.

Huber-Eicker-White robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < .05, ** p < .01. The years used in the panel are
1990, 1994,1998, and 2002. Panel ‘First Stage’ reports PPML estimates of (23). L.FTA and L2.FTA are the first and the second four-year lags,
respectively. Each first-stage estimation is performed with bilateral dummies and directional (source and destination) time-varying fixed effects.
Panel ‘Second Stage’ reports PPML estimates of (25). Each second-stage estimation is performed with directional (source and destination)
time-varying fixed effects. All fixed effects estimates are omitted for brevity. All fixed effects estimates are omitted for brevity. Total FTA effects
in the third panel are calculated as the sum of the individual FTA estimates for each product. Standard errors for the total effects are obtained
with the delta method.

Notes: This table reports percentage changes in the factory-gate prices, the inward multilateral
resistances and the ToT indexes for each country and year in our sample. Country-level factorygate prices are constructed as weighted averages across all country-commodity indexes with
output shares used as weights. IMR’s are aggregated from the country-commodity numbers
with expenditure shares used as weights. ToT’s are calculated as the difference between the
corresponding effects on producers (the factory-gate prices) and consumers (IMR’s). Standard
errors are obtained as described in the text.

Notes: The indexes in this table are aggregate country-level
ToT effects. The numbers in column 1 account for the presence of all FTAs. The numbers in column 2 are constructed
as if there was no NAFTA. The indexes in the third column
are calculated as if Mexico was not involved in any FTA
during the 90s. Standard errors are obtained as described
in the text.
