Crowding Out or Crowding In?
Evidence on Debt—Equity Substitutability

ABSTRACT

When the composition of assets outstanding in the market changes, the
pattern of expected asset returns also changes, shifting to whatever return
structure will induce investors to hold just the new composition of exisiting
assets. The object of this paper is to determine, on the basis of the
respective risks associated with the returns to broad classes of financial
assets in the United States, and hence on the basis of the implied portfolio
substitutabilities among these assets, how government deficit financing
affects the structure of market—clearing expected returns on debt and equity
securities traded in U.S. markets.
The empirical results indicate that government deficit financing
raises expected debt returns relative to expected equity returns, regardless
of the maturity of the government's financing.. More specifically, financing
a single $100 billion government deficit by issuing short-term debt lowers
the expected return on long—term debt by .06%, and lowers the expected return
on equity by .33%, relative to the return on short-term debt. Financing
a $100 billion deficit by issuing long—term debt raises the expected return
on long—term debt by .10%, but lowers the expected return on equity by .24%,
again in comparison to the return on short—term debt. These per—unit
magnitudes are not huge,, but in the current U .S. context of government deficits
approximating $200 billion
year after year — they are not trivially
small either..

These results have immediate implications for the composition of
private financing. In addition, in conjunction with some assumption (for
example, about monetary policy) to anchor the overall return structure,
they bear implications for the total volume of private financing, as well
as for capital formation and other interestsensitive elements of aggregate
demand.

CROWDING OUT OR CWDING IN? EVIDENCE ON DEBT-EQUITY SUBSTITUTABILITY

Benjamin M. Friedman*
Harvard University

To what extent — indeed, whether — government deficit financing
"crowds out" private financing and private capital formation depends, in
the first instance, on how deficit financing affects the structure of the

market returns on debt and equity securities. How market returns respond
to such influences as issues of government debt depends, in turn, on the
relative asset substitutabilities that characterize security holders'
portfolio behavior,. Unless investors regard debt and equity as perfect
substitutes, even the sign of the effect of government debt issues on the
market-clearing expected return on equity depends on the relative degrees

to which investors treat debt, equity and other classes of assets as portfolio

substitutes. In a world in which firms finance investment by equity (or
soixe combination of debt and equity), therefore, whether government

deficit financing "crowds out" or "crowds in" private capital formation

depends also on relative asset substitutabilities)
When the composition of the assets outstanding in the market changes,

the pattern of expected asset returns must in general change also, shifting
to whatever return structure will induce investors to hold just the new

composition of existing assets. Under most familiar circumstances, increasing
the market supply of any specific asset raises that asset's market—clearing

expected return.2 By contrast, an increase in the sply of any one asset
may either raise or lower the expected return on any other asset. The

expected returns on assets that investors regard as close substitutes —for
example, government debt and high—grade corporate debt of comparable maturity —

—2—

presumably

closely

move

together. If investors do not regard two assets as

close substitutes, an increase in the market supply of one may well lower

the expected return on the other. The question here, in short, is whether
investors regard debt and equity securities as close or distant substitutes.
According

of risk—averse

to the standard theory describing the portfolio behavior

investors, the relevant asset substitutabilities that

determine whether "crowding out" or "crowding in" occurs depend on investors

perceptions of the risks associated with holding debt, equity and other

assets. Investors' willingness to hold different assets depends on
their assessments of the respective risks to which holding these assets
exposes them, and their treatment of some assets as substitutes for others

in their portfolios likewise depends on the relationships they perceive among

the associated risks to holding these assets as well as others. If two
assets expose holders to essentially the same set of risks, investors

typically treat the two as close substitutes and allocate their portfolios

accordingly. Assets subject to quite disparate risks are typically more
distant substitutes, or perhaps even complements.
The object of this paper is to determine, on the basis of the respective

risks associated with the returns to broad classes of financial assets in the
United States, and hence on the basis of the implied portfolio substitutabilities
among these assets, how government deficit financing affects the structure
of market—clearing expected returns on debt and equity securities traded

in U.S. markets. The chief line of analysis followed here is to infer
investors' unobservable perceptions of asset risks by applying a mu1tivaiiate

regression procedure with continual re—estimation over time, based on
actual return data, and then to apply the standard theory of risk—averse
portfolio allocation to infer the relevant parameters of investors' asset
demands.

assets together move in response to government deficit financing. Inferences

in addition some

overall return structure. To anticipate, the conclusion that follows from
this analysis is that

government deficits by issuing short—term

debt lowers the return on long-term debt and

lowers

the return on equity by

even more, while financing deficits by issuing long—term debt raises the
return on long-term debt but lowers the return on equity, all in comparison
to

the benchmark of the return on short-term debt.

Section I briefly sets out the underlying portfolio—theoretic
relationships on which

the analysis relies. Section II

outlines the

inultivariate regression procedure for inferring investors' risk perceptions
over tixr, and documents the main properties of the associated expectations
and expectation errors. Section III examines

for

the implications that follow

investors' portfolio behavior in general, and for the "crowding out"

question in particular, from this representation of investors' perceptions.

Section IV tests the robustness of these results to the particular data used
to construct the asset return series by repeating parts of the analysis using

data exhibiting quite different serial correlation properties. Section V
reports the results (largely unsuccessful) of an alternative approach
applying maximum likelihoood methods to estimate investors' behavior using

data on the aggregate portfolio of U.S. households. Section VI summarizes
the principal conclusions of this analysis, and calls attention to several
important caveats.

If the time unit

is

(7)

sufficiently small to render W a good approximation to

E(Wt+i) for purposes of the underlying expansion, then the first (scalar)

term within brackets in (6) is sixiy the reciprocal of the constant coefficient
of relative risk aversion.6

Matrix B in (5), expressing the response of each proportional asset
demand to movements in the expected real returns on that and

other

assets,

contains the set of relative asset substitutabilities that determine how
increases in asset supplies affect the

market—clearing

structure of expected

returns. The solution for B in (6) makes clear the central role of
investors' risk perceptions in governing this behavior. The asset
substitutabilities in B depend only on the investor's risk aversion and risk
perceptions,

here paraireterized by a variance—covariance matrix 2 that in

general may vary over time.
The determination of expected returns follows from equating the

aggregate of all
all

investors'

asset demands

to the net market supplies of

assets. Because of the linearity in expected returns, which follows

here from the assunption of constant relative risk aversion and joint normally

distributed assessments of asset returns, the asset demand relationships in
(5) readily admit of aggregation across investors with diverse preferences
and endowments.7 The relevant market-clearing condition is then just

where A is now the aggregate vector of all investors' individual asset
demands as in (2), and AS is the aggregate vector of assets supplied
by initial conditions on "outside" issuers.8
Solution of (8) determines the relative expected returns on all
assets, or, equivalently, the absolute expected returns on all assets but

one. The market—clearing response of any asset's expected return to a change
in the supply of any "outside" asset follows from (5) and (8) as

central inortance of investors' risk perceptions in governing how
market—clearing expected returns respond to changes in asset supplies is
the

readily apparent.

II. A Representation of Investors' Risk Perceptions
Table 1 indicates the 1960-1980 means, together with the associated

unconditional quarterly variances and covariances, of the after—tax real per
annum returns on three broad classes of U.S. financial assets that differ
fundamentally

from one another according to the risks associated with

holding them: Short-term debt includes all assets bearing real returns that
are risky, over a single year or calendar quarter, only because of uncertainty
about inflation. By contrast, long—term debt is risky because of uncertainty
not

only about inflation but also about changes in asset prices directly

reflecting changes in market interest rates. Similarly, equity is risky

of uncertainty about inflation and about changes in stock prices.

because

The pre-tax nominal return associated with the short—term debt

category here is a weighted average of zero (for money), the Federal

Ieserve average rate on time and saving deposits (for other deposits bearing
regulated yields), and the four-to-six month prime commercial paper rate

(for all other instruments maturing in one year or less), weighted in each
quarter according to the composition of the U.S. household sector's aggregate

portfolio. The pre-tax nominal return on long—term debt is
Baa corporate

the

Moodys

bond yield, plus annualized percentage capital gains or

approximated by applying the standard consol formula to changes

losses

in the Baa yield. For equity the pre-tax nominal return is the dividendprice yield, plus annualized percentage capital gains or losses, on
Standard

the

and Poor's 500 index. For each asset the corresponding after—

tax real return is calculated by applying the household sector's average
effective marginal tax rates in each year for interest, dividends and
capital

gains to the respective components of the pre—tax nominal returns,

The after—tax real returns on all three classes of assets were
serially correlated during this period, with sisple first-order serial

correlation coefficients of .86 for short-term debt, .51 for long—term
debt, and .33 for equity, based on quarterly observations for 1960-1980.
The unconditional variance—covariance matrix shown in Table 1 therefore

presumably

overstates the uncertainty that investors actually associated

with their expectations of asset returns, ovez each coming calendar quarter,
throughout

this period. The object of the analysis here is to construct

a representation of investors' perceptions of these risks that takes more
careful account of what information investors did or did not have at any
particular time.
2\s of the beginning of each calendar quarter, investors presumably

know the stated interest rates on short—term debt instruments, the current
prices and the

coupon rates on long—term debt instruments,

the current

prices and (approximately) the dividends on equities, and the relevant tax

rates. The three uncertain elements that they must forecast over the coming

quarter, in order to form expectations of the after-tax real returns on the
three broad classes of assets considered here, are inflation (P1), the capita].
and the capital gain or loss on equity
gain or loss on long-term debt
The procedure used here to infer investors' risk perceptions

represents

investors as forming expectations of these three uncertain return elements,

at

the forecasting performance of

1960-1980. The respective panels' heavy solid lines show the actual

gain

on equity, while the broken lines show the corresponding series of

one—period-ahead forecasts. (Because of the greater volatility of capital
gains

to

on long-term debt and especially equity, the three panels are

drawn

different scales.) For 1960:1 the three forecasts are based on (10), with

lag lengths L =

1960:11 the procedure is the

period, ending with the use of data for 1953:11-1980:111 to estimate (10)
to generate the one—period-ahead forecasts for 1980 :IV.12
As is clear from the figure, this inherently backward-looking

procedure enjoys the advantages and suffers the shortcomings of
the
expecting the immediate future to be like the immediate past, so that
forecast

degree of success achieved by the resulting one—period—ahead forecasts naturally

varies according to the extent of the serial correlation in the series being

The first-order serial correlation coefficients of the

realizations of the three random variables are .90 or price inflation,
.44

for long-term debt capital gains, and .31 for equity capital gains,

again based on quarterly novements during 1960-1980. The simple

correlation coefficients between the realizations and the corresponding

forecasts derived from continual updating of (10) are .88 for inflation,

.42 for long-term debt capital gains, and .23 for equity capital gains.13
The three panels of Figure 2 exhibit the forecasting performance for
the after—tax real returns iitplied by these one-period—ahead forecasts

of the uncertain asset return elements as in (13). The heavy solid
lines show actual movements of the three asset returns, while the broken
lines show the corresponding series of one-period—ahead forecasts.

(The three panels here are again drawn to different scales). For the
uncertain asset returns, as fo.r the underlying uncertain components, the
forecasting procedure represents the future as resembling the immediate

past, so that the success achieved by the respective forecasts varies

according to the serial correlation in the different asset returns. The
simple correlation coefficients between the realizations of after—tax real
returns and the corresponding forecasts are .83 for short—term debt, P.51

for long-term debt, and .30 for equities.
Table 2 shows the 1960-1980 means of these one-period—ahead forecasts.

Conparison with the corresponding actual means shown in Table 1 indicates

that, on average, the forecasts generated by this procedure were somewhat

too optimistic about the returns on short-term debt and on equities. The

forecasts of the return on
on

long—term

debt were somewhat too pessimistic on

average. In each case, however, the mean absolute error is less than 1%

Table 2 also shows the 1960—1980 means of the variances and covariances

associated with these forecasts, constructed not from the ex post forecast
errors (which investors would not have known in entirety until after
1980:IV) but by averaging, over the eighty-four

individual quarters in this

period, the ex ante conditional variances and covariances associated with

each period's forecast via (14). These conditional variance and covarianCe

are uniformly smaller than the corresponding unconditional
of difference
variances and covariances shown in Table 1. The large margin
averages

in each case reflects the iiiortance of investors' having (and using)
information about recent realizations when the returns they are trying to
forecast are serially correlated.

III. Implications for Portfolio Behavior
Ibgether with a value for the market—average risk aversion, the
variance—covariance matrix summarizing investors' risk perceptions

directly implies the key asset substitutabilities that characterize
investors' portfolio behavior. Because the procedure described in
Section II allows for the fact that the information investors have changes
from one period to the next, it generates a different such variance—

covariance matrix for each period. It therefore implies a different
matrix

of asset substitutabilities for each period.

Figure 3 shows the variation over time of the six elements of matrix
B calculated by applying the transformation given in (6),.up to but not

including multiplication by the reciprocal of the coefficient of relative

risk aversion, to the eighty—four individual quarter conditional variance—

covariance matrices derived via the procedure described in Section l4
The variation of these ,

elements over time reflects a combination

1J

of investors' growing amount of information (starting from the 1953:11
base) and their reaction to specific "surprise" episodes that are also

readily visible in the actual return series plotted in Figure 2. More
information

(in

implies smaller variances and covariances, and hence larger

absolute value) responses, while the immediate effect of "surprises" is

just the

opposite. Prominent examples of such "surprises" that are visible

in Figure 2, and that have noticeable effects on the
in

Figure 3, include

the stock market crash in 1962, the

values

plotted

"credit crunch" in

1966, the Penn Central default in 1970, the combination of OPEC and tight
monetary policy in 1974, and the Federal Reserve System's introduction of
new monetary policy procedures in 1979.

rather than effects on absolute levels of returns, by themselves they

answer

questions about the composition of financing but not about its

total. Nevertheless, in conjunction with some further assumption to

anchor the overall return structure — for example, that monetary
policy accommodates the deficit so as to keep expected short-term

real returns unchanged, or, alternatively, that monetary policy is not
accommodative and hence lets expected short-term real returns rise if

the deficit is large enoi4i — these results also bear straightforward
implications for the total volume of financing and, in turn, for capital
formation and other typically interest-sensitive elements of aggregate
demand.

Results Based on Alternative Return Data
One of

the striking features of the observed asset return series noted

in Section II is the high degree of positive

serial correlation, even in the

long-terra debt and equity capital gain terms, that is readily visible in

Figure 1. Under the standard theory of speculative asset markets, it
is plausible to suppose that these serial correlations are in part the

result of the use of time-averaged data.21 Because the heart of the vector
autoregression procedure outlined in Section II consists of exploiting
the serial correlation properties of the series to be projected, it is
important to be sure that the results reported in Section III are not sixtply
an artifact due to time averaging.
The upper panel of Table 4 shows the unconditional quarterly variances

and covariances of the after—tax real per annum returns on the same three assets
considered in Sections II and iii, calculated from 1969—80 data designed

to eliminate time averaging in so far as is possible. For short-term debt,
the nominal return is a weighted average of zero, the average time and saving
deposit rate for the entire quarter, and the coumercial paper rate for the

last itnth of the quarter.22 For long-term debt,

the nominal return is the

Moody's Aaa rate as of the last day of the quarter plus the annualized change
in Ibbotson and Sinquefield'S (1902) bond price

index from the last day

of one quarter to the last day of the next For equity, the nominal return
is the Standard and poor's 500 dividend for the quarter plus the annualized
change in Ibbotson and Sinquefield's equity price

index (actually the same

each asset the difference between the nominal and real (pre—tax) return
is the annualized change in the consumer price

V. Results Based on an Alternative Estimation Strategy
The analysis of investors' portfolio behavior in Sections III and IV

draws on the conditional variance—covariance structure inferred by applying
the forecasting procedure described in Section II, but it makes no use
of the corresponding inferred sets of conditionally expected returns.

Given these time series of expected returns, and given comparable data on
investors' actual asset holdings, an alternative strategy for learning about
the asset substitutability matrix B is to estimate (5) by time series
regression.

Individual investors, either on their own

or

through intermediaries,

are the ultimate holders of the great majority of all private and government

securities issued in the United States. Table 6. indicates the composition
of the aggregate portfolio of financial assets held directly by U.S.
households, as of yearend 1980, exhaustively arranged according to the

three major asset classes under examination here. Comparable data are
readily available for the end of each calendar quarter during 1960-1980.
Because

there is substantial evidence that individual investors do

not fully rebalance their portfolios within a time span as short as one quarter
year, it is appropriate not to estimate (5) directly but to imbed it within
some model of portfolio adjustment out of equilibrium. The most familiar

such model in the asset demand literature is the multivariate partial
adjustment

where A* is the vector of equilibrium asset holdings corresponding to c in

"adding up" constraints analogous to those applying to B. Substituting for

to

assuming that investors do not respond within the quarter to that

quarter's changes in their holdings due to changing market valuations, but
do respond to market valuations as of the beginning of each quarter.

7. Lintner (1969) showed that, under the assumptions maintained here, the
risk aversion characterizing the aggregate of investors is the harmonic
mean of the respective risk aversion characterizing each investor,
weighted by each investor's respective wealth endowment. (Lintner
also showed that asset demands like those in (5) readily admit to
aggregation over investors with diverse return assessments, but the

analysis here treats all investors as having homogeneous assessments.)

8. The net supply A is zero for any "inside" asset.
9. The marginal tax rates applied to interest and dividends are values
estimated by Estrella and Fuhrer (1983), on the basis of Internal

Revenue Service data, to reflect the marginal tax bracket of the average
recipient of these two respective kinds of income in each year. The
marginal tax rate applied to capital gains is an analogous estimate,
including allowances for deferral and loss offset features, due to
Feldstein et al. (1983). Preliminary eerimentation with the respective
price deflators for gross national product and personal consumption
eenditures indicated that the results presented in this paper are not
very sensitive to the choice of specific inflation measure.

10. The omission of a time subscript from A in (15) abstracts

from changes

time in the capital gains tax rate. The rate actually used here,
from Feldstein et al. (1983), assumes a different value in each calendar

over

year,

as do the respective rates on interest and dividends, from
Estrella and Fuhrer (1983).

11.

The estimated vector autoregression also includes a vector of constants.

12.

An alternative procedure would be to "roll" rather than extend the
sample each period by dropping the earliest observation so as to maintain
the same sample size as each new observation is added. Limited
experimentation indicated that using a rolling sample period leads to
results that differ modestly from those reported below. With a
rolling sample, the mean variance—covariance matrix corresponding to

that reported in Table 2 is (1.00; 3.24, 55.21; 5.17, 48.51).

13.

In comparing these "fit" correlations to the corresponding serial
correlations, it is helpful to recall that investors did not know the
1960-1980 serial correlation properties of these variables until
this period had ended. The forecasting procedure applied here uses

after

only

each

information that investors had at the time they needed to make

quarter's forecast.

14. Matrix B in (6) is necessarily symmetrical, so that three on- and three
off-diagonal elements suffice to summarize the entire matrix at any point

in time. The values shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 below are scaled to
reflect the expression of returns in per cent per annum.

15. The conditions for gross substitutability derived by Blanchard and
Plantes (1977) do not strictly apply here, because there is no riskless

asset, but in fact they are satisfied.

16. See Friedman (1984b) for an arguxrnt relating weak asset substitutabilities,
implied by this and other evidence, to the observed stable total debt—to—
income ratio in the United States during this period.
17. The asset demand responses reported in Friedman (forthcoming), based
on the unconditional variance—covariance structure shown in Table 1,
are of course even smaller in absolute value. For the three off—
diagonal elements, for example, the mean values corresponding to
those shown in Table 3 are SL = -.578, SE = -.0635, and LE = -.150.

18. Because (6) is nonlinear, the mean .. values shown here differ slightly
from the corresponding values that would result from applying (6) to
mean w. values shown in Table 2.

This value is about in the middle of the range of available empirical
estimates. Friend and Blume (1975) suggested a value in excess of two,
Grossman and Shiller (1981) suggested four, and Friend and Hasbrouck (1982)
suggested six. Bodie et al. (forthcoming) also assumed a value of four
in a context similar to the application here.

20. See again footnote 2.
21. The basic point is due to working (1960). The data used to calculate the
returns used in the analysis reported in Sections II and III are quarterly
averages.
