International trade policies are often compared across countries and over time for a variety of
purposes. Analysts use such measures as arithmetic or trade-weighted average tariffs, Non-Tariff
Barrier (NTB) coverage ratios and measures of tariff dispersion. All such measures are without
theoretical foundation. In this paper we develop and characterise a theoretically-based index number
of trade policy which is appropriate to trade negotiations. We also present a sample application
which demonstrates the operationality of our index and shows that it differs significantly from
previously employed atheoretic indexes.
We call our index the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI), since it takes as its
starting point the Mercantilist preoccupation with the volume of trade.

Modern avatars of

Mercantilist thinking are everywhere, and their concern with trade volumes plays an important
constraining role in policy formation. For one example, successive GATT rounds of reciprocal trade
negotiations have interpreted reciprocity in tariff negotiations to mean equivalent import volume
expansion. The WTO goes further, sanctioning retaliation by the offended party to displace a volume
of trade equal to that displaced by the original offending protection. (See Bagwell and Staiger (1997)
for discussion.) For another example, interest group pleading and even U.S. government negotiators
have focused in recent years on trade volumes in auto parts and in semiconductors, as well as on
aggregate U.S.-Japanese bilateral trade volumes. The ubiquity of such examples shows that there is
a demand on the part of practical trade policy makers for measures of trade restrictiveness which hold
trade volume constant.1 Such measures thus have a useful role to play both as an input to

An index of home country tariffs which holds constant the real income of the foreign country is an
appealing alternative for a two-country world. In a many-country world, this loses its appeal because
an index of Japan’s trade distortions can hold constant only one of its trading partners’ real incomes.
Thus there would be N!1 different indexes of each country’s trade policies, differing from each other
in complex and unintuitive ways. A single constant-volume index treats no one trading partner as
special and is appealing as a summary of a country’s restrictiveness relative to the rest of the world.

negotiations and as a performance measure of negotiations.
The MTRI is defined as the uniform deflator which, applied to the undistorted traded goods
prices, yields the same trade volume (valued at external prices) as the initial set of distortions.2
Defining the MTRI as a deflator makes clear its connection with ideal price deflators in general
equilibrium (see Anderson and Neary, 1996). The MTRI is the general equilibrium version of an
index earlier proposed by Corden (1966), which in a quantity index form was independently proposed
by Leamer (1974).3
In Anderson and Neary (1996), we addressed the policy index number problem in the context of
the welfare effect of trade restrictions. We provided a rigorous theoretical foundation for the Trade
Restrictiveness Index (TRI), which operationalises the idea of finding a uniform tariff which yields
the same real income as the original differentiated tariff structure. We advocated its use in studies
of openness and growth and in other applications where it is desirable to have a measure of the
restrictiveness of trade policy which is independent of real income.
For purposes of trade negotiations, however, comparing levels of protection with an index which
holds constant the level of real income is less appropriate. Nations care about the effect of their
partners' policies on their own interests, not their partners' interests. This need is addressed by the
MTRI, which operationalises the idea of finding a uniform tariff which yields the same trade volume
as the original differentiated tariff structure.

2

This definition of the MTRI compares an arbitrary tariff structure with free trade. More generally,
when two different tariff structures are compared, the MTRI is defined as the uniform deflator which,
applied to the new set of distorted prices, yields the same trade volume as the initial set of distortions.
3

Neither the Corden nor the Leamer indexes include the disposition of tariff revenue in the analysis.
Hence they are not full general equilibrium indexes.
2

The main objective of the theoretical section of the paper is to relate the MTRI to the TRI and
to standard atheoretic measures. In particular, we show how changes in both indexes can be
characterised fully in terms of changes in two summary measures of the tariff structure, which we call
the generalised mean and generalised variance of tariffs. These theoretical linkages are of interest in
themselves, especially since they imply that the MTRI must exceed the TRI when trade policies are
compared with free trade. In addition, the theoretical results help to explain the clear patterns which
emerge from the empirical comparisons of these measures.
For the practitioner, this paper offers a consistent index number of trade restrictiveness which
meets the Mercantilist concern with trade volume. The practical analyst is confounded at present by
the thousands of different trade barriers and the absence of a theoretically based index number to
summarize them. The paper concentrates on tariffs, but also offers an approach to the evaluation of
quotas.4 By offering the first application of the MTRI, the paper shows that use of a proper index
makes a great deal of difference.
Section 1 sets out the basic model of the economy and defines the MTRI. Section 2 derives the
properties of the MTRI and relates them to the properties of the average tariff and other indexes,
especially the TRI. Section 3 extends the MTRI to cover the case of quotas. Section 4 presents the
empirical analysis, which uses a 25-country cross-section of data from around 1990, and a 5-country
panel of year-on-year changes from the late 1980’s. The MTRI differs from standard indexes in its
implications, often dramatically. It also differs substantially from the TRI.
4

Domestic taxes and subsidies in goods and factor markets can also affect trade significantly, as
shown by their prominence in recent policy negotiations. Anderson, Bannister and Neary (1995)
extend the TRI to take account of such domestic distortions. A volume-equivalent index of the trade
restrictiveness of domestic distortions is readily constructed by combining the methods of this paper
with that one.

1. Theory
The economy is assumed to be in competitive equilibrium, to have no distortions other than tariffs,
and to be characterized by a single representative consumer. Traded goods prices are fixed on world
markets. (Relaxing these assumptions leads to well-understood complications without adding any
insight. In practice, the index we develop can be calculated in the context of any operational model
economy.) Section 1.1 lays out the basic formal model of a tariff-distorted open economy, Section
1.2 introduces the import and import volume functions and Section 1.3 defines the MTRI.
1.1 The Model of a Tariff-Distorted Open Economy
The behaviour of the private sector is described by the trade expenditure function E(B,u). This
function gives the expenditure needed by the representative consumer to attain the utility level u
facing the price vector B of traded goods subject to tariffs, net of the income it receives from its
ownership of the factors of production. Both of these in turn are represented by standard expenditure
and GDP functions respectively:
E(B,u)

'

e(B,u) & g(B) .

(1)

In the background are factor endowments, prices of non-traded goods and factors (which are
endogenous given B and u), and prices of traded goods not subject to tariffs. Standard properties of
the underlying functions (Shephard's and Hotelling's Lemmas) allow us to identify the price
derivatives of the trade expenditure function as the economy's general-equilibrium utility-compensated
(or Hicksian) import demand functions:
EB(B,u)

'

m c(B,u) .

(2)

4

For later use, we note the derivatives of these functions:
c

mu

' eBu ' euxI

and

c

mB

' EBB .

(3)

In words, the utility derivatives of the import demand functions equal the Marshallian income
derivatives of demand xI scaled by the marginal cost of utility eu; while the matrix of price derivatives
equals the Hessian of E and so is negative semi-definite (which for convenience and with little loss
of generality we strengthen henceforth to negative definite).
The trade expenditure function completely summarises private-sector behaviour in our model
economy. In the presence of tariffs, we must add to this the behaviour of the government, whose sole
activity is to collect tariff revenue and rebate it to the representative consumer in a lump sum. The
outcome of both public and private behaviour is summarised by the balance of trade function:5
B(B,B(,u)

/

E(B,u) & (B&B() . EB(B,u) .

(4)

This differs from the trade expenditure function by the tariff revenue term, where the vector B!B*
denotes the tariff wedge between domestic and world prices. The derivative of the balance of trade
function with respect to the level of utility is:
Bu ' eu [1 & (B&B() . x I ] .

(5)

This equals eu times the inverse of the shadow price of foreign exchange, which measures the welfare
gain to a unit increase in the economy's purchasing power. We assume throughout that it is positive,

5

All vectors are column vectors; a prime (N) denotes a transpose; and a dot (.) denotes a vector inner
product.
5

since otherwise the economy is initially so distorted that welfare would rise if some of its endowment
were destroyed. (See Anderson and Neary (1992) for more discussion and references.) As for the
derivatives of the balance of trade function with respect to domestic prices, they equal:
BB)

'

& (B&B()) EBB .

(6)

This vector gives the marginal welfare effects of domestic price changes. Since the balance of trade
function equals the amount of foreign exchange needed to sustain utility u facing domestic and world
prices B and B*, the fall in B following a tariff increase (which raises the corresponding element of
B) is a money metric measure of the resulting welfare cost.
The general equilibrium of the economy is reached when utility is at the level consistent with the
balance of trade constraint. This requirement equates the balance of trade function to any lump-sum
income received from abroad, denoted by b:
B(B,B(,u)

'

b.

(7)

The balance of trade function thus allows us to summarise the equilibrium of an economy subject to
tariffs in terms of a single compact equation.
1.2 Import and Import Volume Functions
As with an individual consumer, we can relate the economy's Hicksian import demand functions
(2) to their Marshallian equivalents.6 The latter depend on domestic and world prices and on
exogenous income b: m = m(B,B*,b). In equilibrium (given by the balance of payments condition
(7)), the Hicksian and Marshallian import demand functions coincide:
6

For a more formal derivation, see Neary and Schweinberger (1986).
6

m c(B,u)

m[B,B(, B(B,B(,u)] .

'

(8)

Differentiating this "Slutsky Identity" with respect to u and using (3) and (5) yields:
mb

[1&(B&B().xI]&1 xI .

'

(9)

Thus an increased transfer from abroad raises demand for imports to an extent determined by the
marginal income responses xI, grossed up by the shadow price of foreign exchange. Differentiating
(8) with respect to B gives a standard Slutsky decomposition of the effects of price changes into
substitution and income effects:
c

mB & mb BB) .

'

mB

(10)

Of course, world prices are fixed, so income effects of domestic price changes arise only to the extent
that tariffs are in place. This is seen more clearly by eliminating BB using (6), to obtain an alternative
expression for the price derivatives:
mB

'

c

[ I % mb(B&B()) ] mB .

(11)

where I is the identity matrix.
Finally, since we are concerned with the volume of tariff-restricted trade (measured at world
prices), it is convenient to express its equilibrium level as a function of the variables characterising
the general equilibrium of the economy. This leads to two scalar import volume functions, one
compensated:

7

M c(B,B(, u)

/

B(. m c(B,u) .

(12)

B(. m(B,B(,b) .

(13)

and the other uncompensated:
/

M(B,B(, b)

The derivatives of these functions are easily derived from the corresponding derivatives of the import
demand functions. Here we note only that the derivative of the Marshallian import volume function
with respect to exogenous income is:

b

'

B(. mb

'

[1&(B&B(). xI]&1 B( . xI ,

0 < Mb <

(14)

This can be interpreted as the marginal propensity to consume tariff-constrained imports, valued at
world prices, and it plays a crucial role in the analysis below. We assume throughout that it lies
between zero and one. Finally, the Slutsky decomposition of the import demand functions given in
(10) implies a corresponding decomposition of the price derivatives of the Marshallian import volume
function. By analogy with (8), we can relate the Hicksian and Marshallian import volume functions
by a Slutsky identity:
M c(B,B(, u)

'

M [B,B(, B(B,B(, u)] ,

(15)

which, on differentiation, gives the required decomposition:
MB

'

c

MB & M b BB) .

(16)

Armed with these results, we are ready to define the MTRI and to investigate its properties.
8

1.3 The Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index
We wish to compare the restrictiveness of trade policy between two equilibria, denoted by "0" and
"1" respectively.

Following Anderson and Neary (1996), we define the Mercantilist Trade

Restrictiveness Index (MTRI) as the uniform price deflator µ which, when applied to the prices in the
new equilibrium, B1, yields the same volume (at world prices) of tariff-restricted imports as in the old
equilibrium, M0:
µ(B1,M 0)

/

{µ: M(B1/µ) ' M 0}.

(17)

We simplify notation by dropping the explicit dependence of the trade volume on the exogenous
variables B* and b, which are set at their period-0 values.
The interpretation of the MTRI depends on the policy stance in the new equilibrium. If B1 equals
its free trade value B*, µ equals the inverse of the uniform tariff factor which is equivalent in volume
to the initial distortion structure. The Mercantilist uniform tariff equivalent is defined as 1/µ!1. For
other values of B1, µ equals the uniform tariff factor surcharge which is volume-equivalent to the
changes in trade policy.
Reflecting policy concerns similar to those leading to the MTRI, it may be useful to define other
members of a group of trade-balance-constrained trade restrictiveness indexes based on the same
logic. For example, in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations, the bilateral trade balance is often a focal point.
In this case the relevant constraint for the index number for Japan might include both Japanese
imports and exports to the U.S., both distorted and undistorted.

Alternatively, U.S.-Japan

negotiations have also focused on bilateral trade in particular product groups, such as motor vehicles
and parts or electronics. All cases in this class can be straightforwardly developed using the tools
9

above.

2. Relation to Other Indexes
Useful insight into the meaning of the MTRI is gained by analyzing its relationship with other
index numbers. The analysis also helps put in perspective the empirical results in Section 4. We first
lay out the MTRI, the TRI and the trade-weighted average tariff in a comparable local rate of change
format in Section 2.1. We then show in Section 2.2 that changes in both the MTRI and the TRI can
be fully characterised in terms of changes in the generalised mean and variance of the tariff schedule.
Finally, Section 2.3 compares the levels of the MTRI and TRI.
2.1 The MTRI, the TRI and the Average Tariff
Following Anderson and Neary (1996), the TRI is defined as:
)(B1,u 0)

/

{): B(B1/), u 0) ' b 0} .

(18)

This has a similar uniform tariff deflator interpretation to the MTRI. The difference is that its
reference point is the base-period level of utility rather than the volume of trade. The value of ) is
the uniform tariff deflator which, if applied to the new prices B1, would ensure balance-of-payments
equilibrium at the initial level of utility.
Both the MTRI and the TRI are defined in implicit form, so comparing their levels is difficult in
general. However, we can say a great deal if we first consider local changes. The proportional rate
of change (denoted by a circumflex) of the MTRI is:

10

'

µ̂

MB . dB
MB . B

,

(19)

with MB evaluated at (B1/µ). Similarly, the proportional rate of change of the TRI is:
ˆ
)

'

BB . dB
BB . B

,

(20)

where BB is evaluated at (B1/),u0). Each of these in turn may be compared with the change in the
trade-weighted average tariff, Ja:

dJa

'

EB . dB
EB . B

.

(21)

Considering these three expressions, we see that, multiplying and dividing by prices in the
numerator, each can be written as a weighted sum of the proportional changes in prices dBi /Bi. The
change in the MTRI in (19) weights proportional price changes by their marginal volumetric shares,
MiBi /MB .B. The change in the TRI in (20) weights the proportional changes in prices by their
marginal welfare shares, BiBi /BB .B. Finally, the change in the average tariff in (21) weights
proportional price changes by their average trade shares, EiBi /EB .B.
An important feature of the MTRI change is that it incorporates the effect of real income changes
on trade volume whereas the TRI change does not. To deal appropriately with this, it is convenient
to define a "compensated" MTRI:
µ c(B1, u 0, M 0 )

/

{µ c: M c(B1/µ, u 0 ) ' M 0},

whose rate of change is:

11

(22)

c

µ̂

c

'

MB . dB
c

MB . B

.

(23)

Once again, this is a weighted sum of proportional price changes, where the weights can be
interpreted as marginal trade shares.
Now, suppose the initial levels of µ, ) and µ c are the same. Then we can write the rate of change
of µ as a weighted average of the rates of change of the other two indexes:
µ̂

ˆ
8µ̂ c % (1&8)),

'

(24)

where the weight is simply:
c

8

/

MB . B
MB . B

.

(25)

The weight 8 is the ratio of the compensated to the uncompensated effect on import volume of a 1%
rise in domestic distorted prices. It is ordinarily between zero and one and it is smaller the more
important are income effects relative to substitution effects. (Recall from (11) that 8 is unity in the
neighbourhood of free trade.)
2.2 Generalised Tariff Moments
Next, we wish to relate changes in the MTRI and the TRI to changes in the mean and variance
of the tariff distribution. This turns out to be possible provided, following Anderson (1995), we work
not with trade-weighted tariff moments but with generalised tariff moments, weighted by the
elements in the substitution matrix EBB.
12

At this point it is convenient to switch notation. Define the ad valorem tariff on good i as Ji
=(Bi!B*i )/B*i. Let x denote a diagonal matrix with the elements of the vector x on the principal
diagonal. Then the level of and the change in domestic prices can be written as:
B

'

B( (4%J)

and

dB

'

B( dJ,

(26)

Next, define the matrix of substitution effects normalised by world prices as:
B(EBB B(

/

S

B()EBBB(

.

(27)

By construction S is a positive definite matrix all of whose elements sum to one: 4NS4=1, where 4 is
a vector of ones. We can now define the generalised average tariff:
J̄

/

4)SJ,

(28)

and the generalised variance of tariffs:
V

/

(J&4J̄)) S (J&4J̄)

'

J) S J& (J̄)2 .

(29)

V must be positive (since it is a quadratic form in the positive definite matrix S) but J̄ can be negative
if tariffs are non-uniform and disproportionately higher on goods with relatively large crosssubstitution effects.7 The changes in these generalised moments are:
Equation (28) for the generalised average tariff can be written as Ei wiJi, where the weights are
defined as: wi/Ej Sji . Recalling that S is defined to be positive definite, the weight on a given tariff
rate is more likely to be positive the higher the own-substitution effect for that good and the more
it is complementary with rather than substitutable for other goods. A sufficient condition for all
weights to be positive is that the normalised substitution matrix have a dominant diagonal.

(30)

The change in the variance of tariffs can also be interpreted as twice the (generalised) covariance
between initial tariff rates and their changes:
Cov (J, dJ) ' (J&4J̄))S(dJ&4dJ̄) ' J)SdJ&J̄dJ̄ ' ½dV .

(31)

It is now straightforward to express the changes in the three indexes of interest in terms of dJ̄ and
dV. From (23) and (27), the change in the compensated MTRI is:
µ̂ c

(32)

Thus the change in the compensated MTRI is identical to the proportionate change in the generalised
average tariff. Similarly, the change in the TRI can be expressed as:

J) S (4%J)

and the change in the MTRI as:

(4%MbJ))S(4%J)

'

(1%MbJ̄) dJ̄ % ½ Mb dV
(1%MbJ̄) (1%J̄) % M b V

.

(34)

The role of income effects, represented by the marginal propensity to spend on imports Mb, is clearly
crucial: they affect the sensitivity of the MTRI but not of the TRI to changes in the generalised mean
and variance of the tariff schedule.
The significance of equations (33) and (34) is that they are completely general, with no restrictions
14

on the types of tariff changes or on the structure of the economy. Their implications can be set out
in terms of three propositions and a diagram. First, it is immediate that:

Proposition 1: Assume the denominators of )ˆ and µ̂ are positive. Then, both the MTRI and the TRI
are increasing in the generalised mean and variance of the tariff schedule.

Note that, from (33) and (34), an over-strong sufficient condition for the denominators of both )ˆ and µ̂
to be positive is that J̄, the generalised average tariff, be positive.
Next, consider the relative sensitivity of the two indexes to changes in the generalised mean and
variance. This is best understood by writing the changes in both indexes as weighted averages of the
changes in the two tariff moments. For the TRI, (33) implies:
ˆ ' " dJ̄ % (1&") dV ,
)
1%J̄
2V

"/

J̄(1%J̄)
.
J̄(1%J̄) % V

(35)

Similarly, for the MTRI, (34) implies:8
' $

% (1&$)
,
1%J̄
2V

$/

(1%MbJ̄) (1%J̄)
(1%MbJ̄) (1%J̄) % M bV

(36)

Using D" and D$ to denote the denominators of " and $ respectively, the difference between the
weights is:
$& " '

(1%J̄) V
,
D"D$

(37)

From (24), it may be checked that 8=($!")/(1!"). Moreover, from (29) and (31), dV/2V equals
the slope coefficient from a generalised least squares regression of dJ on J.
8

15

Assuming the two denominators are positive, " is always less than $. Thus the TRI is less sensitive
than the MTRI to changes in the generalised mean tariff but more sensitive to changes in the
generalised variance of tariffs. Finally, the difference between the changes in the two indexes is:
ˆ & µ̂ ' ($&") dV & dJ̄
)
2V
1%J̄

'

&VdJ̄ % (1%J̄)½ dV

(38)

This may be expressed more compactly by defining the generalised coefficient of variation of tariff
factors and its rate of change as follows:
C /

(39)

Hence, recalling from (37) that $!" is positive provided the denominators of )ˆ and µ̂ are positive,
we may conclude:

Proposition 2: Assume that the denominators of )ˆ and µ̂ are positive. Then, starting from the same
point, the TRI increases by more than the MTRI if and only if the generalised coefficient of variation
of tariff factors rises:
ˆ > µ̂
)

]

Ĉ > 0 .

(40)

The full relationship between changes in the TRI and MTRI on the one hand and changes in the
generalised tariff moments on the other is illustrated in Figure 1, drawn in the space of (dV, dJ̄).
From Proposition 1, both indexes increase together in the north-east quadrant and fall together in the
south-west quadrant. The upward-sloping dashed line is the locus along which )ˆ =µ̂. Only in the
regions denoted I and II (which lie between the )ˆ =0 and µ̂=0 loci), do they move in opposite
16

directions. In Region I, the fall in the generalised average tariff is sufficient to offset the rise in the
generalised variance as far as µ is concerned but not as far as ) is concerned: µ falls and ) rises.
Exactly the opposite configuration applies in Region II. (From (24), the µ̂=0 locus lies between the
)ˆ =0 locus and the µ̂ c=0 locus, which from (32) coincides with the vertical axis.) Note that a rise in
) is equivalent to a fall in welfare and a rise in µ is equivalent to a fall in import volume. Hence
Figure 1 gives a complete characterisation of the effects on welfare and import volume of arbitrary
changes in the generalised tariff moments.
2.3 Comparing the Levels of the MTRI and TRI
Having derived the relationships between changes in the MTRI and the TRI, we can now relate
their levels, at least for the comparison with free trade. The key result is:

Proposition 3: The MTRI exceeds the TRI for comparisons with free trade, provided the generalised
average tariff is positive. The ranking is strict except when tariffs are uniform, in which case all
tariff indexes are equal.

Proof: By definition, µ(B0,M0)=)(B0,M0)=1. In words, when the initial tariff policy does not
change, both indexes equal one. Hence, comparing the initial tariff policy (B0) with free trade (B*),
the difference between µ and ) is the same as the difference between their proportional rates of
change, provided this is one-signed over the relevant interval:
B(

lnµ(B(, M 0) & ln)(B(, u 0) '

m

B

ˆ u 0) .
µ̂(B, M 0) & )(B,

0

17

(41)

To find a path in price space from B0 to B* along which the expression in brackets is always nonnegative, we proceed in two stages:
(i) First, we eliminate the dispersion in the initial tariff structure by radial steps:
dJ ' & (J&4J̄)d,,

d,>0.

(42)

Substituting from (42) into (30), we see that, along this segment of the path, the generalised average
tariff is constant (dJ̄=0) and the generalised variance is falling, provided it was strictly positive to
begin with (dV=!2Vd,<0). Hence the generalised coefficient of variation is also falling and
Proposition 2 applies. With the initial generalised average tariff J̄0 assumed to be positive, it also
follows from (19) and (20) that both indexes are falling. Hence, along this segment of the path, we
have 0>µ̂>)ˆ . Continue in this fashion from B0 to B*(1+J̄0), i.e., until all the dispersion in the tariff
structure is eliminated.
(ii) Next, with C=V=0, we implement a uniform radial reduction in tariffs: dJ=!Jd,. Again, from
(30), this must reduce the generalised mean tariff (dJ̄=!J̄d,) and leave the generalised variance
unchanged (since it was zero to begin with): dV=!2Vd,=0. Hence, from (33) and (34), both indexes
fall by the same percentage amount along this segment of the path: 0>µ̂=)ˆ . Proceeding along this
segment of the path until we reach free trade, the proposition follows immediately.
~
To interpret the proposition, recall that for comparisons with free trade, µ and ) equal the
inverses of the uniform tariff equivalents which are import-volume-equivalent and welfare-equivalent
to B0 respectively. So, the facts that µ exceeds ) and that both are less than one means that the
welfare-equivalent uniform tariff exceeds the import-volume-equivalent uniform tariff. Thus the tariff
18

levels calculated according to the MTRI logic generally under-estimate the tariff levels which would
be appropriate for welfare comparisons.

3. Quotas and the MTRI
Quotas are an important form of trade intervention in many countries. Moreover, other kinds of
non-tariff barriers may often be represented as quotas. The application of Section 4 includes many
examples of non-tariff barriers treated in this way. Thus it is important to extend the definition of the
MTRI to incorporate quotas. For simplicity, we continue to assume that all distortions are in trade
only.
Let q denote the vector of quota-constrained goods, with domestic prices p and world prices p*;
while m, B and B* continue to denote the quantity and prices of tariff-constrained imports. As before,
we seek a scalar deflator which, when applied to the policy variables in the new equilibrium, {q1,B1},
will yield the same import volume as the old equilibrium, M0. However, it would not make sense to
deflate the quota vector directly. Instead, we apply the deflation factor to the domestic-marketclearing prices of the quota-constrained goods.
To formalise these ideas, we adapt the techniques developed for the analysis of quotas in
Anderson and Neary (1992) and applied to derive the TRI in the presence of quotas by Anderson and
Neary (1996). The net expenditure on non-quota-constrained goods, called by Anderson and Neary
(1992) the distorted trade expenditure function, is:
Ẽ(q,B,u)

/

max{E(p,B,u) & p.q},
p

(43)

where the undistorted trade expenditure function E is defined in a similar manner to (1). The

derivatives of Ẽ with respect to B give the compensated import demand functions for goods subject
to tariffs, as in earlier sections; while the derivatives with respect to q give (minus) the "virtual" prices
of the quotas:
ẼB(q,B,u) ' m c(q,B,u)

Ẽq(q,B,u) ' & p(q,B,u) .

and

(44)

Of course, when {q,B,u} relate to the same equilibrium, the virtual prices equal the market-clearing
domestic prices. The distorted balance of trade function can now be defined as:
B̃(q,B,u)

/

Ẽ(q,B,u) % p.q & (B&B().m & (p&p ())(I&T) q

(45)

where m and p are determined from (44) and exogenous variables are suppressed to economise on
notation. This is more complex than the corresponding undistorted function (4), since there are now
two sets of trade restrictions, and (following standard convention) we assume that the rents generated
from each are disbursed differently. The private sector receives all the tariff revenue, as in Section
2, but only some of the quota revenue, with the elements of the T vector (0<
_ Ti<
_ 1) denoting the share
of quota rents on good i lost to foreigners. Finally, equilibrium utility is determined implicitly by the
balance of payments equilibrium condition:
B̃(q,B,u)

'

(46)

b.

These functions allow us to determine the appropriate virtual prices and characterise the
equilibrium in the presence of quotas. Next, to define the MTRI itself, we need to define the
uncompensated volume-of-trade function given the prices of the quota-constrained goods. The steps
in doing this are similar to those followed in Section 1.2. First, the compensated volume-of-trade
20

function is an extension of (12):
M c(p, B, u)

/

p.E p(p,B,u) % B(.EB(p,B,u) .

(47)

To derive the uncompensated volume-of-trade function from this, we must specify the undistorted
balance of trade function. We do this by noting that the undistorted and distorted functions can be
equated when the former is evaluated at the appropriate virtual prices. Thus:
B(p̃,B,u)

'

B̃(q,B,u)

when

p̃

/

& Ẽq(q,B,u)

(48)

As in (15), the uncompensated volume-of-trade function, M(p,B,b), can now be defined implicitly as
follows:
M c(p,B,u)

'

M [p,B,B(p,B,u)] .

(49)

We are finally able to define the MTRI itself:
µ(q 1, B1, M 0)

/ {µ: M(p̃/µ, B1/µ) ' M 0} ,

(50)

where the virtual prices p̃ are determined endogenously by the requirement that domestic markets for
quota-constrained goods clear, i.e., by equations (46) and (48) evaluated at (q1,B1). With the quotas
reduced to their price equivalents, the interpretation of the MTRI now proceeds in exactly the same
way as in the case of tariffs only.

21

4. A Sample Application
The MTRI can be made operational with only slight modifications of any standard Computable
General Equilibrium (CGE) model. All that is necessary is to define the virtual prices p̃ and the
volume of distorted trade M. Then the deflator µ can be calculated. Ideally, the CGE model should
be disaggregated with respect to trade distortions (and those domestic distortions which are important
in considering trade policy). Most CGE models are highly aggregated with respect to trade and so
are not ideally suitable for this purpose. It should be possible, however, with strategic use of nested
CES structures, to disaggregate many existing CGE models appropriately.
Applications are chiefly constrained by the paucity of detailed distortion data. While limits on
information are notorious for non-tariff distortions, there is also surprisingly little systematic detailed
information on tariffs and associated import volumes across a broad spectrum of countries and years.
Here, we draw on Anderson’s (1998) application of the TRI and use the same data and CGE model
as a basis for calculating the MTRI and comparing it with the TRI and the standard indexes.
Anderson (1998) develops a tractable CGE model with a highly aggregated CES/CET industrial
structure and a very disaggregated trade structure, and calculates the TRI for both a cross section of
countries and for a few cases of year-on-year changes. The model's main virtue is that it requires
relatively little information about the domestic production structure, so a standard model framework
can be used across a large group of countries. At the same time, it permits the use of as detailed trade
distortions data as the analyst can find.
Limits on detailed trade and trade distortion data dictate the scope of the results presented below.
The data were obtained by the World Bank from the TRAINS (TRade Analysis and INformation
System) database (UNCTAD (1996)), supplemented by trade and trade distortions data supplied by
22

country economists at the Bank. Non-Tariff Barriers (NTB's) are treated as binding quotas in the
model. To obtain consistent trade flow and trade distortions data, more detailed data are aggregated
to the four-digit Harmonized System level using trade-weighted average tariffs, and for NTB's using
the procedure that a four-digit category is counted as NTB-constrained if 75% or more of its
elements are "hard-core" NTB-constrained.9 Some such atheoretic aggregation procedure is
unavoidable due to inconsistencies in classification systems of the most detailed distortion and trade
data.
A key practical issue is the treatment of quota rents, bearing in mind that information on domestic
prices (and hence on quota premia) are not available. In simulating the move to free trade (i.e., in
Table 1 and Figure 2 below) we assume that rent-retaining tariffs capture all the quota rent, so all
NTB's are non-binding at the margin in the initial equilibrium.10 Hence the policy regime is assumed
to be one of tariffs only, with quotas replaced by their tariff equivalents. In evaluating year-on-year
changes (Table 3 below), we assume instead that binding quotas generate rents which are entirely lost
to foreigners or to rent seeking, apart from the fraction which is retained by tariffs. Alternative
expedients (discussed in Anderson (1998)) lead to similar qualitative results.
Table 1 presents the results of calculating the TRI and MTRI using the CGE model for a crosssection of 25 countries. In this table we are comparing the actual data for the country and year
indicated with free trade (so B1=B* and J1=0). Hence we present both the TRI and MTRI in terms
of their uniform tariff equivalents (i.e., 1/)!1 and 1/µ!1) to facilitate comparison with the trade-

A "hard-core" NTB includes some restrictions which are hardly quantitative, such as being under
investigation for dumping. It excludes simple licensing requirements. See UNCTAD's description
of their NTB database for details.

Tariffs on NTB-constrained goods are in practice usually quite high.
23

weighted average tariff, Ja0. To see why this makes sense, we can rewrite the definition of the MTRI
from (17) as follows:
M[B((4%J1)/µ] ' M[B((4%J0)] ' M 0 .

(51)

With J1=0, we seek a scalar measure of the vector J0. The atheoretic measure is the trade-weighted
average tariff Ja0, while the theoretically correct measure is 1/µ!1, the uniform tariff that is importvolume-equivalent to J0. A similar argument applies to the uniform tariff equivalent of the TRI,
1/)!1, which gives the uniform tariff that is welfare-equivalent to J0. To facilitate comparison of the
columns in Table 1, Table 2 presents the results of simple regressions and rank correlations between
the columns. Figure 2 illustrates the data from Table 1, with countries ranked by their trade-weighted
average tariff.
The first observation suggested by Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2 is that the MTRI and the tradeweighted average tariff tend to move closely together on average. (The correlation and rank
correlation coefficients between the two are 0.987 and 0.972 respectively.) However, for individual
countries involved in trade negotiations, this does not mean that the two measures are
interchangeable. On the contrary, the average tariff underpredicts the MTRI in all but three of the
twenty-five cases. The effect is not statistically significant (as Table 2 shows) and the underprediction
is only 8.9% on average. However, it is important in a number of individual cases, exceeding 15%
for Austria, Indonesia, Morocco and the U.S.A. This suggests that in trade negotiations, most
countries would prefer to use the MTRI to evaluate their own trade policies but average tariffs to
evaluate their partners'. On the other hand, for India, the average tariff underpredicts the MTRI by
7%. So the choice between the two measures is significant and of unpredictable sign in individual
24

cases.
The second observation suggested by Table 1 and Figure 2 is that the TRI exceeds the MTRI by
a significant margin: 48.7% on average. We know from Proposition 3 that µ must be greater than
) (and hence 1/)!1 must be greater than 1/µ!1), for comparisons with free trade (at least when both
indexes are generated by the same utility-consistent model, as here). This theoretical prediction is
borne out for every case in the table.11 The relationship between the two is weaker than that between
the MTRI and the average tariff (with correlation and rank correlation coefficients of 0.886 and 0.800
respectively). The percentage divergence also varies considerably, ranging from over 100% in three
cases to less than 10% for Bolivia, Mexico and Peru. Here too the theoretical results of Section 2
provide some insight. Proposition 2 showed that, for small changes, ) rises by more than µ if and
only the generalised coefficient of variation of tariffs increases. This suggests that the actual
coefficient of variation of tariffs might help predict the divergence between the two indexes (since the
generalised coefficient is not available in practice). The last column in Table 1 give the coefficient
of variation of tariffs and the final regression in Table 2 confirms that the percentage excess of the
TRI over the MTRI is positively and significantly related to the coefficient of variation of tariffs.
Overall, it is clear that the two different purposes of evaluating tariff structures yield very different
pictures of the relative restrictiveness of nations’ trade policies.
Table 3 turns to consider a small sample of year-on-year changes. We now wish to have a
measure of the change in the tariff structure from J0 to J1. Referring back to (51), the theoretically
correct measure is simply µ (rather than its uniform tariff equivalent), while the corresponding
11

The numbers in the table are given to only three significant digits, so in one case, Bolivia, the values
shown for the two indexes are equal to one another. From the raw data, the percentage excess of the
TRI over the MTRI for Bolivia is 0.22%, while the next smallest differential (Peru) is 0.88%.
25

atheoretic measure is (1+Ja1)/(1+Ja0). Thus, a value greater than one in any of the first six numeric
columns of the table indicates that, according to the measure in question, trade policy became more
restrictive between the two years indicated. Because tariffs on NTB-constrained goods serve the
positive function of retaining rent rather than the negative one of restricting trade, we report average
tariffs for these separately. We also distinguish between the average tariffs on intermediate and final
goods categories. In addition, Table 3 reports the (arithmetic) change in the coefficient of variation
of tariffs, and gives information on two measures of NTB restrictiveness: the initial level of and the
(arithmetic) change in the NTB coverage ratio, and the (percentage) change in the volume of NTBconstrained imports.
In dramatic contrast to the results of Table 1, the MTRI in Table 3 differs considerably from the
standard indexes. This echoes the finding of Anderson (1998), where the TRI was shown to differ
dramatically from the average tariff and from all the other standard indicators in evaluating year-onyear changes in policy. There is a good reason for this. In the hypothetical leap to free trade, all
standard indicators of trade policy move in the same direction. By contrast, in most real-world trade
reforms there are conflicting tendencies which make it much more important to take the structure of
index numbers into account. In all cases except the disaggregated average tariffs on intermediate
goods, the tariff measures and the MTRI are negatively correlated. As might be expected,
comparison of the MTRI and the two direct quantitative NTB measures (the change in the NTB
coverage ratio and the proportional change in volume of NTB-constrained goods) shows a closer
relationship. Many of the countries analysed had a high initial incidence of NTB's and were
liberalizing NTB's in the years considered.
Comparing the changes in the MTRI and the TRI, the first columns of Table 3 show that they
26

always have the same sign, but no consistent ranking emerges between them. Surprisingly, in the
year-on-year changes, the MTRI and TRI changes are quite highly correlated, with a correlation
coefficient above 0.95.
The results overall show that the MTRI is much different from standard measures in practice,
enough to matter to practical policy-making. In future tariff negotiations it should be useful to come
equipped with MTRI measures of proposed changes in policy. Our results also throw light on the
appropriateness of using trade-weighted average tariffs as measures of trade restrictiveness in
empirical studies. Table 1 suggests that they may be appropriate in cross-section regressions.
However, Table 3 suggests that in panel data studies, such as the estimation of cross-country growth
regressions, they are likely to be very poor proxies for the two theoretically based indexes of trade
restrictiveness.
Of course, all our estimates of the TRI and the MTRI are dependent on the model used to
calculate them. Anderson (1998) reports that results are not very sensitive to elasticity values, a
finding which applies here as well. This is consistent with the folklore of CGE modelling, that
elasticities do not matter much but that specification of the model does matter. (For an illustration
in the TRI context, see O'Rourke (1997).) Where MTRI measures are important, it would be useful
to have several different calculations based on differing CGE models. Despite these caveats, the case
seems to be made that the standard measures are likely to be very seriously misleading in practice.

5. Conclusion
In this paper we have presented a theoretical analysis of the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness
Index and compared its empirical performance with other measures of trade policy. The MTRI is
27

defined as the uniform tariff which yields the same volume of imports as a given tariff structure.
Since it is a true index number for tariffs, the performance of empirical measures should be evaluated
in terms of how closely they approximate to the MTRI. We also showed how the properties of the
MTRI can be related to changes in the tariff structure, summarised in terms of two parameters, the
generalised mean and variance of tariffs. These techniques seem likely to prove useful in many other
contexts. Finally, we have shown how the MTRI can be extended to allow for quotas for tariffs; and
it can easily be extended further to account for the trade effects of domestic taxes and subsidies, using
the methods of Anderson, Bannister and Neary (1995).
As for our empirical results, we found that on average the MTRI is correlated with the tradeweighted average tariff in comparisons with free trade and with changes in NTB restrictiveness in
year-to-year comparisons of trade policy. However, it diverges significantly from both in individual
cases, to an extent which makes standard atheoretic measures highly suspect in practice. Especially
if tariffs are far from uniform, it seems highly desirable to use the MTRI rather than standard
atheoretic measures to evaluate the restrictiveness of real-world protective structures.
