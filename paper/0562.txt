Reconsidering the Work Disincentive
Effects of Social Security
ABSTRACT

This paper shows that, contrary to commonly held views, the provisions

of the social security law actually provide strong work incentives for older

men. The reason is that, for most workers, higher current earnings lead to
higher future social security benefits. These incentives have been particularly
strong for workers under 65 years of age and, although they will be reduced
somewhat when the 1977 amendments to the social security law become fully

effective, they will remain substantial. The findings raise serious questions
about recent econometric work attributing the decline in labor force participation rates of older men to the social security system.

1. Introduction
Labor force participation rates of older men in the United States have

declined significantly in recent decades. Among the factors that allegedly account
for this phenomenon is the social security system1 which has increased both in coverage

and in generosity over the period. That social security should lead to earlier

retirement seems in accord with common sen and so is widely assumed. Furthermore,
several recent econometric contributions have appeared to buttress this common
1
assumption.

Our purpose in this paper is a curmudgeonly one: to case doubt on the
widespread view that social security provides significant work disincentives for older

men. Our principal reason for raising doubts about the common sense view is a poorlyunderstood provision of the law which provides strong work incentives for most workers-incentives which in many cases are large enough to cancel out or even overwhelm the
work disincentive effects of the earnings te5t.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly describes and
critically evaluates the conventional argument for why social security discourages

labor supply. Section 3 explains in some detail the important aspect of the law that
has hitherto mostly been ignored: the fact that current earnings can increase future
social security benefits. Calculations based on the Longitudinal Retirement History
Survey (LRHS) are presented to show that this effect is typically equivalent to a wage

subsidy

roughly equal in size to the tax rate of the earnings test. Section 4 offers

some concluding remarks, but

our

main message is both simple and important enough to

be inenlioned right at the outset. Social security certainly distort.s labor-leisure
choice, but not in any simple way. It. may in fact induce some older workers to reduce
their labor supply. But there must be many others who--if they understood the law
properly--would be encouraged to work even more than they would in the absence of

social security.

Work Disincentives: The Conventional View
The conventional view that social security discourages the work effort of

older workers is based on two perceived problems with the law. First, benefits are
subject to an earnings test which implicitly taxes earnings beyond an exempt amount

at a 50% marginal rate. Second, actuarial adjustments for those who defer benefits

believed to be insufficient, so the expected present value of social security
benefits declines the longer one stays at work. We take up each of these in turn.

who do not (line segment de).
The potential work disincentive effects of the earnings test are obvious
from Figure 1 and, indeed, we should not be surprised to find many people "bunched"

at point c.4 This is the basic indictment of the earnings test; but it is naive for

several reasons. The first of these is well known: many individuals who select a point

to the left of point c receive an increase in their future benefits.
Actuarial Adjustments
The nature of the actuarial adjustment made to future social security benefits
of individuals who have some of their benefits withheld depends on whether the individual
is eligible for partial benefits (ages 62-64) or for full benefits (ages 65 and over).
For individuals aged 62-64, the intent of the law is to provide an actuarially

fair increase in future benefits for those who forego current benefits. Let us
consider what an actuarially fair adjustment would mean in terms of the budget constraint

of Figure 1. Individuals who elect not to draw the (partial) benefits for which they
are eligible (the height ab) would have their future benefits increased to compensate

them for this loss on an actuarial basis. Thus consider an individual who chooses
to work enough so as not to draw benefits at age 62. With no actuarial offset, his
net earnings would be e0(l-t), and he would accrue no future social security benefits.

With a full actuarial offset, by contrast, he would receive e0(1-t) from his own
earnings plus an increase in future social security benefits equal in actuarial present

value to the benefits he gives up this year, B, making his total income e0(l-t) + B.
Thus his effective budget constraint, would be parallel to line ade , and uniformly

above it by an amount equal to B. This is shown in Figure 2 as line abcfg.5
While students of the social security program are well aware of the actuarial
adjustmert given to workers aged 62-64, many have expressed skepticism that it is

actuarially fair.6 To measure the extent to which the compensation actually is fair,

we have made computations based on the law as it was in 1973, and life tables based

on 1975, for a number of hypothetical individuals. Our calculations can be explained
with reference to Figure 2. In this figure, the kinked budget constraint abcde simply
duplicates Figure 1, and the hypothetical budget line

abcfg

indicates what a full

actuarial compensation would create (distance fd is equal to distance ab). Consider

the decision to decrease leisure from 10 to 1 hours. With no actuarial offset,

move from point c to point f instead. With a partial adjustment, he would move to
some intermediate point uch as h .

Our calculations measure the distance dh as

a fraction of the potential distance df

ab •

Thus a value of zero represents no

actuarial adjustment, a value of unity represents a full adjustment, and so on.
The first two columns of Table 1 offer a selection of the many results we

have obtained. There are several striking aspects. First of all, we have selected
as our 'base case" a representative 62-year--old: he is white and married, his wife
is 59 years old,7 he has no dependent children, and his earnings history gives him
average monthly earnings (AME) of $Li36, an arbitrary but

representative

amount. For

such a person, the adjustment is precisely actuarially fair at about a 5% interest
rate--a figure that is quite high for a real after-tax interest rate. At more

realistic (lower) interest rates, there is actually a considerable actuarial bonus
for deferrinp benefits.

The story is only slightly less dramatic for an unmarried man.

While the

actuarial present value of the increase in his future benefits is smaller since he
has no wife, so is the current benefit that he gives up.

On balance, the actuarial

offset is reduced somewhat. (Compare lines 1 and 2.)
The actuarial offset is smaller, however, if the wife is at least 65 or if

there are dependent children. The reason is that no compensation is given for wives'
or children's benefits that are lost when the worker foregoes one year's benefits

by continuing to work. Lines 3-5 in Table 1 show how the actuarial offset is reduced
in several such cases. "Older wife" denotes a 62-year-old man with a 65-year-old
wife. For him the actuarial adjustment is unfair, but still restores 71—87% of his
lost benefits.8 The situation is quite similar for a 62-year-old man with a 59-yearold wife and a 15-year-old child ('one dependent chi1d, line ii-).

For those few men

of this age with two dependent children (line c) the actuarial offset falls far short
of being complete.

Things are quite different, however, for individuals aged 65 and over
because, for them, the law makes no effort to give fair actuarial compensation for
lost benefits. Instead, until the .1977 amendments to the social security law become
effective, a token increase of 1% in future benefits is granted in any year in which
the individual earns enough to lose all of his current benefits (i.e., works somewhere

to the left of point d). This introduces an upward discontinuity into the budget
constraint at point
That this 1% increase in benefits is quite inadequate is seen in the two

middle columns of Table 1--which apply to a 65-year-old man. Except for the base
case, the actuarial adjustment is trivial (12% or less). In the base case, however,
the wife is under 65;
her benefits are

so the offset, though incomplete, is not negligible because

Just over one—third of lost benefits

are recouped.

The 1977 amendments raise the 1% increase in future benefits to 3% beginning

in 1981. As can be seen in the last two columns of Table 1, this reform will increase
the actuarial adjustment in our base case to around 50%--thus negating about half of

the apparent tax implied by the earnings test. Adjustments

in other cases are smaller,

with single men getting about a one-third offset and other groups getting still less.

Our conclusions thus far seem to be as follows.

postpone benefits that is typically fair or more than fair. This means that the
effective budget constraint comes much closer to abcfg in Figure 2 than to abcde, so
that the effective wage is essentially what it would have been in the absence of

social security benefits. For men 65 and over, the actuarial offsets are far from
complete, though the 1977 amendments will eventually make them restore perhaps 30-50%
of the lost benefits for a typical man.

3.

The Effect of Current Earnings on Future Benefits

We have thus far argued that, when both the earnings test and the actuarial
offsets are considered simultaneously, the social security law provides neither work
incentives nor disincentives for 62'-64-year-olds, but probably provides some disincentives

for those 65 and older. We now turn to a rather neglected provision of the law which
provides rather dramatic work incentives for almost all older workers.
The provision we have in mind is the automatic recomputation of benefits

whenever current earnings rise above a certain amount. We first describe and evaluate
how this mechanism operated prior to the 1977 amendments to the social security law-since this is the law that has applied to all men who have retired to date, and
thus to all the recent econometric studies that have purported to detect a negative effect

of social socurty benefits on the labor supply of older men.1° Once this discussion
is complete, we consider how things were changed by the 1977 amendments.
Automatic Benefit Recomputation (ABR)
To illustrate how automatic benefit recomputation (ABR) works, consider a man

turning 65 in 1975. As noted above, the potential benefit for which he is eligible,
B, dept'nds on his earn:thgs history, E, and on two principal demographic characteristics:

whether he is married, and whether he has dependent children. It is calculated in
steps. First, his earnings history is used to compute his Average Monthly Earnings

(ÂME). The AME depends on the T years of highest current earnings between 1951 and
the current ytar, where the value of T is the year in which the irdividual reached

65, minus 1956.11 Let the earnings history for those

and let e.

be the lowest of these. As soon as current earnings, e0,

exceed emi

the automatic benefit recomputation provision (APR) comes into play because e0

replaces emin in the earnings base used for computing benefits in future years.
The effect of this replacement on ÂME is easy to calculate, as it depends
only on the worker's age. For each dollar of earnings above emjn the ÂME increases
by l/12T (the 12 converts annual earnings

to moh1y earnings). But what this increase

in ÂME does to the individual's future benefits depends on several other factors.
First, the individual's Primary Insurance Amount

(PIA) depends on ÂME in a piecewise

children. 13

Thus the increase in annual benefits when current earnings increase by one

dollar (assuming current earnings exceed emin) is
Finally, the actuarial present value

of this increase in annual benefits depends on

the
t,he rate of discount and on any factor relevant to life expectancy (including

life expectancy of the wife, because of survivor's benefits).

while

this may seem small, it must be remembered that this amount is to be received for as
long as the individual lives, and then two-thirds of it is received for as long as
the wife

survives.

For a 1% real interest rate and actual life expectancies, an

actuarial present value calculation amounts to multiplying this annual benefit of

by a factor of about 16. The conclusion, therefore, is that the additional social
security benefits attributable to the recomputation amount

to about

for each

dollar of earnings; that is, the marginal return to work effort is thereby increased

by 51% of the wage rate. This is hardly a trivial effect, to say the least.
Since the value of benefits from ABR is obviously sensitive to the

discount rate used, this is an appropriate point to explain our use of such low

discount rates. Note first that a real after-tax interest rate is appropriate, since
social security benefits are indexed and tax free, and that such rates are historically

very low. (Indeed, they are often negative.) Second, note that (except for issues
of risk aversion) the probability that the individual might die is irrelevant to the
choice of discount rate because survival probabilities are automatically incorporated
in the

actuarial

present value calcu].ations. Third, while high rates of subjective

time preference are often confused with high rates of interest, only interest rates

are relevant to valuing streams of future income. Subjective time preferences come
into play only in deciding how to consume the value of an asset over one's remaining

lifetime. Even if older men have very high subjective discount rates, it would still
be

appropriat.e to use the low market interest rate unless these men had drawn down all their

assets and were being constrained by an inability to borrow against future
social security benefits. For all these reasons, we believe that a very low discount

rate like $

is most appropriate.

= 0) because they had not worked in covered employment

for T years. Virtually 100% of the sample would have been able to receive ABR before
they earned $5,000. For reference, average annual earnings of all private nonfarrn

workers in the U.S. in 1975 exceeded $8,000. Another way to put these results into
perspective is to note that the exeipt amount of earnings under the social security
law, denoted in

above, was $2,520 in 1975. Thus for almost half of all workers the

wage subsidy from ABR became relevant before the tax from the earnings test, so that
Figure 3b rather than Figure 3a was relevant.

The next question is how large the implicit wage subsidies implied by

automatic benefit recomputation actually are. Table 3, which contains the principal
results of this paper, tabulates the frequency distribution of this subsidy expressed
as

a percentage of the

current wage. For the most part the calculations use the 1

percent discount rate that we find most realistic. However, for those who prefer a
higher rate, we also show results based on a 5% discount rate. Each column in t.e
table is a frequency distribution. Thus, for example, with a 1% discount rate and the
1975 law, colunin (1), 42.14 of married men had subsidy rates between 55% and 60%,

33.1% hrid subsidy rates btweon 50% and 55%, and so on.

The results in columns (1)-(3) are quite striking. Implicit subsidy rates
for married men average about 54%, with most concentrated in the 50-60% range.16
Thus benefit recomputation just about offsets the tax implicit in the earnings test.
Even at a 5% discount rate, which we view as far too high, most married men still had

implicit subsidy rates between 35 and

Single men receive only about half this

subsidy rate, however.

The conclusion, then, is that our illustrative example is indeed representative
of the situation that has faced the vast majority of married men who reached retirement

age during the 1970s. The automatic benefit recomputation certainly has been no mere
detail.

It is, however, worth paying some attention to the tails of the distributions
in Table 3.

Looking first at the lower tail, we note that 9Z of

15% of single men get no benefit recomputation at all. These

married men and

individuals are at

the minimum PIA, so their benefits are independent of current ernings at the margin.
For this minority, budget constraint abcde in Figure

of their choice set, and so work disincentives are likely. At the other

extreme, however, we find that about 14

percent

of married men and about 1.5 percent

of single men turning 65 in 1975 experienced implicit wage subsidies greater than 70
percent: This is an extremely large wedge' which should have had a correspondingly
large

incentive effect on

their labor supply.

One further characteristic of the automatic benefit recomputation (ABR)

merits consideration. The actuarial present value of any increase in future social
security benefits obviously depends on age.

All the calculations in Table 13 are based

on 65-ycar-olds. If we considered these sare individuals at a younger age, the annual
flows of future benefits from ABR would be identical, but the discount factors needed
to convert these flows to an

equivalent

current wage subsidy would be greater. Thus

the implicit suhdy rate is lower at younger ages, which provides an incentive to
shift labor supply to older ages--exactly the opposite of the assunption made by
Burkhauser and Turner (1978).

For men older than 6,

implicit subsidy. For example, the average subsidy rate for married men using a 1%
discount rate falls from 54%

at

age 65,

to

44% by age 69

and 34% by

age 73.

Thus the

subsidy rate peaks at age 65.

Combining both of these cases, it seems that the automatic benefit
recomputation provision, considered in isolation, provides some incentive to concentrate
work effort around age 65.

As we have seen earlier, however, the actuarial offsets

to the earnings test are normally fair before age 6 and unfair thereafter. So it
seems that when both factors are considered social security provides the strongest
work incentives for individuals aged 62-64--precisely the group that many have claimed

The 1977 Social Security Amendments
In 1977 many aspects of the social security law were revamped, and one of

these changes affected automatic benefit recomputation in an important way. Prior to
the 1977 amendments, the A1€ was based on the nominal earnings history. Since the
1977 amendments,covered earnings through age 60

have

been indexed to average earnings

in the year in which the individual turns 60. Thus, for example, if a nominal

earnings figure like $1,600 from some past year is included in the earnings base,
but average wages have tripled between that year and the year in
turns

which the individual

60, then $4,800 is used in computing Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIMS).

element of indexing has a clear effect on the likelihood that any

particular individual will be subject to automatic benefit recomputation: it lowers
the chances by substantially reducing the gap between "old earnings" and "current

earnings" for most people. In addition, for those who remain subject to ABR, the
implicit subsidy rates were reduced by the 1977 amendments because the amendments,
while raising typical AIMS values by indexing, simultaneously reduced the slope

coefficients (PIA/ AI1E. For most people, this reduction was about one-third,
indicating a one-third reduction in the typical subsidy rate.

Thus even when the 1977 amendments become fully effective, automatic benefit
recomputation will still provide large wage subsidies to most workers.
Interaction with Supplemental Security Income (ssI)

One final proviso about recent revisions in the law. Since 1975, individuals
with poor earnings histories have been eligible to draw benefits from Supplemental
Security Income (ssi) that exceed the benefits they would be entitled to under the

standard social security program. For these individuals, who now comprise about oneeighth of all social security recipients, automatic benefit recomputation is irrievant.
Thus

some of the low income people that would have faced huge wage subsidies from ABR

of SSI (the upper tails of the distributions in Table

3) no

have this strong work incentive.

4. Summary and Conclusions
The main findings of this short paper are easy to summarize:

1. The earnings test for social security does not present a work disincentive
for the typical worker aged 62-64 because, if he loses benefits to the earnings test,
he recoups most or even more than all of them through an actuarial adjustment of his

future benefits. There are, however, exceptions to this--especially those few men
of this age who have dependent children.

2. At least prior to the 1977 amendments and the advent of SSI, the vast
majority of workers became subject to automatic benefit recomputation at rather low

levels of work effort. This provision provided an implicit wage subsidy of 5O-6O,
about the same as

the

tax rate in t,he earnings test, and it remained in effeot over

a much broader range of earnings.
3.

Because of these two effects, and especially the latter, it seems likely

that the social security law--if understood by the public--should provide work

disincentives for only a small minority of individuals. It seems that social security

18
should induce the majority of older workers to work harder.

15.

4.

Recent changes in the law, especially SSI and

the

indexing provisions

in the 1977 amendments, will reduce the importance of automatic recomputation, though
it still seems likely that most individuals working close to full time will be subject

to it. Wage subsidies implicit in the benefit recomputation will be about two-thirds
as large as they were in the 1970s.
5.

Social

security no doubt distorts labor-leisure choices in many complex

ways, and therefore creates a variety of deadweight losses.

But the glib assertion

that these distortions typically amount to powerful work disincentives is just that--

a 1ib assertion.
These findings, in turn, lead us to two sorts of conclusions--one aimed at
scholars doing research on the effects of social security, and the other aimed at

encouraged retirement are surprising, to say the least.19 The approaches used in
econometric studies of the labor supply effects of social security need rethinking,
and will probably have to be much more complicated than those that have been used to date.
7. In discussing automatic benefit recomputation with knowledgeable governhuLent

officials and academic researchers, we learned that while almost everyone knew that
the provision existed, almost no one had any idea of its quantitative importance.

F1rthnrmore, the nature of the recomputation is clearly complex. These two facts

that social security is discouraging labor supply only because its provisions are poorly

effects that social security may now be having on the labor supply decisions of older

16.

workers is simply to tell these workers how the law really works: Happily, this
policy initiative is non-partisan and non-ideological, requires no legislation, and

should entail negligible budgetary expense. A good policy, it would seem.
However, a broader policy issue can be raised. According to our arguments,
social security is probably distorting the labor-leisure decisions of most older

workers in the direction of greater work effort. This is particularly true of those
between 62 and 64 years of age, who on balance typically receive a 5O wage subsidy.

It is not clear what social purpose is served by this distortion.
