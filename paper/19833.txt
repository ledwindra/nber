Restoring the Product Variety and Pro-competitive Gains from Trade with Heterogeneous
Firms and Bounded Productivity

NBER Working Paper No. 19833

JEL No. F12
ABSTRACT
The monopolistic competition model in international trade offers three sources of gains from trade
that do not arise in competitive models: expansion in product variety; a pro-competitive reduction
in the markups charged by firms; and the self-selection of more efficient firms into exporting. Recent
literature on trade with heterogeneous firms has emphasized the third of these effects, and the first
two effects are ruled out when using a Pareto distribution for productivity with a support that is unbounded
above. The goal of this paper is to restore a role for product variety and pro-competitive gains from
trade by using a bounded Pareto distribution for productivity.

1. Introduction
The monopolistic competition model in international trade offers three sources of gains
from trade that do not arise in competitive models. First, opening to trade can lead to expansion
in product variety, as goods not available in autarky become imported. This first source is
emphasized in the earliest writings by Krugman (1979) and throughout Helpman and Krugman
(1985). A second source of gains emphasized by these authors is that the pro-competitive effect
of trade reduces the markups charged by firms, and therefore lowers consumer prices. In order
for this fall in prices to translate in a social gain, and not just a re-distribution from firms to
consumers, we need the assumption of zero profits due to free entry. Then the reduced ratio of
price to marginal cost implies a reduced ratio of average to marginal costs, too, so that firms are
taking greater advantage of economies of scale. In this way, the consumer gains due to reduced
markups become social gains because of the accompanying expansion of firm scale.
The third source of gains arises in the more recent models of monopolistic competition
and trade with heterogeneous firms, due to Melitz (2003). In this case, trade will lead to the selfselection of more efficient firms into exporting, while less efficient firms exit the market, leading
to rise in average productivity. This third source of gains has been the focus of recent literature.
For example, if we add the assumption that firm productivity is unbounded above with a Pareto
distribution, as in Chaney (2008), then it can be shown that the gains from trade in the Melitz
(2003) model are entirely due to the selection of firms: the welfare gains from new imported
varieties are just offset by the loss from fewer domestic varieties (Feenstra, 2010); and of course,
there is no change in markups due to CES preferences. Even without the unbounded Pareto
assumption, Melitz and Redding (2013) have recently argued that the rise in average productivity
due to firm selection and trade in the Melitz model is what distinguishes it most clearly from the

2
homogeneous firm model of Krugman (1980). Even if we allow for non-CES preferences with
heterogeneous firms, so that in principal a pro-competitive effect could operate, Arkolakis,
Costinot, Donaldson and Rodriguez-Clare (ACDR, 2012) have recently shown that neither this
effect nor product variety leads to any gains; so once again, the key source of gains from trade
comes from the selection of firms.1 That result in ACDR depends on the assumption of a Pareto
distribution of productivity with a support that is unbounded above, which is the starting point
for this paper.
The goal of this paper is to restore a role for product variety and pro-competitive gains
from trade with heterogeneous firms, by using a bounded (or truncated) Pareto distribution for
productivity. The empirical relevance of this approach is beyond question: Helpman, Melitz and
Rubenstein (2008) have used the bounded Pareto to obtain a gravity equation in trade that is
consistent with the many instances of zero trade flows between countries.2 It is surprising, then,
that the bounded Pareto has not received more theoretical attention (though it is consistent with
Melitz, 2003, who did not constrain the distribution). One reason for the popularity of the
unbounded Pareto is that, like CES preferences, it leads to highly tractable solutions for trade and
welfare. A secondary goal of this paper is to show that the bounded Pareto distribution still
yields tractable solutions, even with a class of preferences allowing for non-constant markups.
Specifically, we will work with a class of preferences introduced by Diewert (1976)
known as the quadratic mean of order r (QMOR) expenditure function. This is perhaps the most

1

ACDR further show that total gains are reduced by the pro-competitive effect – which becoming an “anticompetitive” effect – when tastes are non-homothetic. That result is obtained because the positive overall gains leads
to an expansion of demand in favor of the higher-markup varieties, which worsens the distortion as compared to the
first-best with constant markups (Dhingra and Morrow, 2012). In contrast, we assume homothetic tastes so this
“anti-competitive” effect does not occur.
2
Another motivation for using bounded productivity comes from the theory of globalization put forth by John
Sutton and summarized in his Clarendon Lectures (Sutton, 2012). Sutton uses three assumptions to derive the
interaction of firms as globalization proceeds, the third of which is “you can’t make something out of nothing”
(Sutton, 2012, p. 55). That assumption is intended to rule out unbounded productivity.

3
general parametric form for expenditure that is dual to homothetic preferences. It differs from the
class of preferences used by ACDR because it is homothetic, and more important, because it
gives an explicit functional form for the expenditure needed for one unit of utility – that is, for
the cost of living.3 In contrast, ACDR rely on an implicit solution for welfare by integrating from
demand, which makes it challenging to deal with non-infinitesimal changes in product variety.4
The QMOR expenditure function is introduced in section 2 where, because we are dealing with a
monopolistic competition model, we assume that demand is symmetric across varieties and also
that it has a finite reservation price. Given these properties, we establish the sign pattern of the
parameters needed to ensure that the QMOR expenditure function is globally well-behaved: a
feature that has not been assured in prior applications, mainly empirical.
Our use of the QMOR expenditure function sets this paper apart from other recent,
theoretical literature dealing with variable markups in international trade. A more common
choice is to use the additively separable utility function introduced by Krugman (1979), possibly
with an explicit functional form for the sub-utility from each variety.5 Zhelobodko et al (2010,
2011), Kichko et al (2013) and Dhingra and Morrow (2012) consider a broader class of
additively separable functions than Krugman (1979) by allowing the elasticity of demand to be
increasing or decreasing in quantity. These authors argue for a pro-competitive effect of trade in
the latter case only (as assumed by Krugman and holding here). But when these authors consider
heterogeneous firms, they do not appear to recognize that a Pareto distribution with unbounded
support implies that the pro-competitive effect vanishes, as we shall explain here.

3

The class of preferences used by ACDR includes one homothetic case – the translog preferences – which are also
included within the QMOR class. This is the only case that is common to both classes, as explained in section 2.
4
In ongoing work, these authors propose a quantitative method to perform this integration, thereby obtaining
welfare from estimated demand.
5
Behrens and Murata (2007, 2012) use exponential functions and the latter paper includes pro-competitive effects,
while Saure (2009) and Simonovska (2010) use a logarithmic function with displaced origin.

4
Another line of literature related to this paper assumes a finite number of firms, in which
case markups are endogenous even with nested-CES preferences.6 Initiated by Atkeson and
Burstein (2008), this framework is used by Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2012) to compute the
pro-competitive gains from trade between the United States and Taiwan. Specializing to the case
of Bertrand competition between firms, De Blas and Russ (2012) contrast the results obtained by
Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003) using an infinite number of rivals to those obtained
instead with a finite number of rivals; only in the latter case does a pro-competitive effect of
trade operate. Our paper is most closely related to Holmes, Hsu and Lee (2013), who also use
Bertrand competition and show that if and only if the distribution of productivities is unbounded
Pareto, then trade leads to gains only through selection and not through markups. In these papers,
Bertrand competition occurs between firms producing perfect substitutes, so there are no gains
from product variety.
Before proceeding, we should give a brief intuition as to why the pro-competitive effect
of trade vanishes with heterogeneous firms and the unbounded Pareto distribution. Suppose that
we measure markups by the ratio (not the difference) of price and marginal cost. The most
productive firm has zero cost, but a non-zero price, so its markup is infinite. The least productive
surviving firm will have its marginal cost equal to the reservation price, so its markup is zero.
This range of [0,+) for markups applies equally well to domestic and foreign firms, even if the
latter face variable trade costs. Furthermore, the distribution of markups within this range is
determined by the Pareto distribution of productivity. So changes in trade costs have no impact at
all on the distribution of markups, from either domestic or foreign firms, but still affect the mass
(or extensive margin) of exporters. The fixed distribution of markups no longer holds, however,

6

Eaton, Kortum and Sotelo (2012) also consider a model with a finite but stochastic number of firms.

5
when productivity and markups are bounded above, since then the highest foreign markup
depends on trade costs (so trade costs also affect the intensive margin).
Our paper proceeds as follows. We show in sections 2 and 3 that the QMOR expenditure
function allows us to decompose the cost of living – and therefore welfare – into components
that correspond to product variety, the pro-competitive effect, and the selection effect which is
captured by average firm productivity. In the trade environments we shall consider, we are able
to establish how these components change individually and jointly due to liberalization. This
allows us to establish the gains comparing autarky to frictionless trade (section 4), and for small
changes in trade costs around the frictionless equilibrium (section 5). Importantly, we contrast
the source of gains with unbounded versus bounded Pareto, and show that it is only in the
bounded case where the product variety and pro-competitive gains apply.
Finally, we are able to compare the magnitude of total gains from trade using unbounded
versus bounded Pareto. Measured in relation to initial utility, we find that the proportionate rise
in welfare due to trade liberalization is largest in the unbounded Pareto case, despite the fact that
neither the product variety nor the pro-competitive channels operate in this case. Constraining
the Pareto distribution to be bounded allows those extra sources of gains to operate, but reduces
the gains due to firm selection, so that the total proportionate gains are lower. This result is
related to Melitz and Redding (2013), who compare a heterogeneous firm model (with any
productivity distribution) to a homogeneous firm model (i.e. with a degenerate distribution), both
with CES preferences. They find higher proportionate gains when productivity is disperse across
firms. We are using non-CES preferences, and find higher proportionate gains when productivity
is the most disperse across firms, i.e. unbounded above. Conclusions are given in section 6, and
the proofs of propositions are in the Appendix.

2. Consumer Preferences
Expenditure Function
We shall adopt the quadratic mean of order r (QMOR) expenditure function, which is
defined by Diewert (1976, p. 130) over a discrete number of goods with price vector p as:
1/ r

er (p)    i  j bij pir /2 p rj /2 



, r  0,

where r and bij are parameters. We shall consider the symmetric case where bii = and bij = for
i  j, so that the QMOR function is re-expressed over a continuum of goods indexed by  as:


er (p)    pr d  






1/ r

2
r /2
 p d 

, r  0.

(1)

This function is the expenditure needed to obtain one unit of utility, or the cost of living. For
specific values of the parameters r,  and , this expenditure function takes on familiar forms.
For  > 0,  = 0 and r =(1–), the expenditure function is CES, so that r < 0 for  > 1. For r = 2,
we obtain a quadratic expenditure function, but without the additively separable outside good
used by Melitz and Ottaviano (2008). For r = 1, we obtain what Diewert (1971) calls a
Generalized Leontief function (since the dual to a Leontief production function is linear in prices
like the first term of (1) for r =1, while the second term adds generality). And as we show below,
as r  0 then (1) approaches a translog function. So the quadratic mean of order r function nests
the commonly used homothetic cases.
While the special cases of the quadratic mean of order r function have been applied
empirically, it has not been applied in a monopolistic competition setting. To do so, we need to
recognize that demand is positive if and only if prices are less than a reservation price p*, equal
across goods since the expenditure function is symmetric. In the CES case the reservation price
is infinite, but we will focus here on finite reservation prices, while obtaining CES as a limiting

7
case. Goods that are not available should have their prices in (1) replaced by p*, because that is
the economically relevant price to evaluate expenditure, demand and welfare. To formalize
this, without replacing any prices define    | p  p * as the set of available goods, with
mass N   d   0 . Denote the mass of all possible goods by N   d  N . Then replacing


the prices in (1) by p* for    , we rewrite the expenditure function as:

.

Differentiating this expression with respect to p*, dividing by ( N  N ) and multiplying by
utility u, we obtain the demand for a good with price p*. Setting this demand equal to zero we
solve for the reservation price:

The second term in (2) is a mean of order r/2 of the prices p (also called a power mean),
and for all values of r this mean lies between the minimum and maximum values of p. The
reservation price is above this mean price if and only if the first term in (2) is greater than unity.
To ensure this and also rule out the CES case of an infinite reservation price, we assume:

Assumption 1
(a) If r < 0 then  > 0,  < 0 and [ N  ( /  )] < 0 ;
(b) If r > 0 then  < 0,  > 0 and 0 <[ N  ( /  )] < N ;

8
It is readily confirmed that parts (a) and (b) of Assumption 1 ensure that the first term on the
right of (2) exceeds unity, so the reservation price exceeds the mean price. Part (c) is consistent
with (a) and (b) in the sense that either set of inequalities hold for small r so the first term of (2)
is again greater than unity. Furthermore, in this limit it is shown by Diewert (1980, p. 451) and in
the Appendix that the expenditure function in (1) approaches the translog form,

While we have motivated Assumption 1 by the requirement that the reservation price in
(2) exceeds the mean price, we should be more rigorous in checking that the QMOR expenditure
function satisfies the necessary conditions for an expenditure function: that it is positive and nondecreasing, homogeneous of degree one and concave in prices. Concavity implies that demand
curves slope downwards, which will ensure that the reservation price in (2) exceeds all prices p
for goods with positive demand, and not just the mean price. Confirming that these regularity
conditions hold ensures that the expenditure function can be derived from a well-behaved
homothetic utility function.
To check these conditions, substitute the reservation price (2) back into (1) to obtain
expenditure defined over the available goods    | p  p * :

We can compute demand by setting p '  p for prices in a small interval  '  [ ,    ] ,

Note that this expression equals CES demand if we specify  > 0,  = 0 and r = (1–) < 0 for

 > 1, in which case p* and the final bracketed term above vanishes. For p < p* this final
term has the same sign as  under Assumption 1, so demand is positive except when the price is
greater than or equal to the reservation price p*. This guarantees that the expenditure function is
non-decreasing in prices.
We can eliminate utility u in (4) by using total expenditure

 p q (p)d  er (p)u .

Evaluating the integral using (4), we solve for reduced-form expenditure:

(5)

Again, for p < p* the term in square brackets in (5) has the same sign as  under Assumption 1,
so expenditure is positive provided that a non-empty set of goods are purchased. Another
condition that we need to confirm is that the expenditure function is concave in prices. Concavity
implies that demand is downward sloping, and for the symmetric QMOR expenditure function,
the reverse is also true as we show in the Appendix. We directly evaluate the elasticity of
demand by differentiating (4) with respect to p  p * , holding utility u and expenditure er (p )
constant, obtaining:

The final term above approaches zero in the CES case when  0 and r =(1–) < 0, so p* 
and 1– r = . But with  0 under Assumption 1, this term is positive for p  p * and so

  1  r . With r  0 we then obtain   1  r  1  2r  1. For 0  r  2 , the term in curly
brackets in (6) exceeds unity, so that   1  r  2r  1  2r  0 . Summarizing, we have:

10

Proposition 1
Under Assumption 1, for N > 0 and r < 2 the QMOR expenditure function (3) is globally positive,
non-decreasing, homogeneous of degree one and concave in prices, with a finite reservation price.

Proposition 1 is the first time that the QMOR expenditure function has been shown to be
globally well-behaved, and the fact that we can establish these properties is made possible by the
assumed symmetry across goods. For values of r > 2, the demand curves in (4) are still downward sloping in a neighborhood of the reservation price, but we cannot guarantee this property
globally. A final property is obtained by differentiating (6) and simplifying, to obtain:

   1  r    1  2r  0 ,
 ln( p / p*)





so the elasticity is increasing in price, using the inequalities discussed just before Proposition 1.

Welfare Gains

Having confirmed that the expenditure function is well-behaved for r < 2, we should
explain how our demand system relates to that used by ACDR and also derive conditions to
ensure welfare gains. Assume for convenience that labor is the only factor of production and
each consumer has one unit, so that income equals the wage, w. Then w  uer (p) , which we can
use in (4) and (5) to obtain the demand shares:

(7)

and D(p)   d ( p / p*)d . The term D(p) in the denominator of the share expression ensures


that the shares integrate to unity. In comparison, ACDR assume an expression for the demand
shares that depend on the wage, the price p, and also the reservation price p*, but does not

11
involve any term like D(p) . Nevertheless, the shares integrate to unity because of the presence
of the reservation price. It turns out that the ACDR demand shares and those in (7) have only one
case in common: the translog case, as r 0. The translog demand shares are given by:

Setting the demand share equal to zero, we see that the reservation price is:

(8)

so that the demand share is also expressed as s (p)    ln p  ln p * . Integrating over the set
of products  , we immediately see that the shares integrate to unity without the presence of a
term like D(p) . Indeed, using Assumption 1(c) it can be shown that lim r 0 D(p)  1 in the
translog case.7 ACDR consider a whole family of demand functions with the convenient property
that the shares are defined using the price and the reservation price. All those demand functions
except for the translog correspond to non-homothetic utility functions, while the translog is the
only case in common with our homothetic expenditure function.
Combining (5) with the definition of D(p) , we see that:
er (p)  p * D(p)1/ r .

(9)

With labor as the only factor of production, and firm profits equal to zero under monopolistic
competition, welfare is u  w / er (p) , so a drop in the expenditure function will indicate welfare
gains. Proposition 1 guarantees that as the price of any good falls from the reservation price, then
welfare rises so increased variety is beneficial for the consumer. Our goal here is to develop

This is shown from (7), (8), Assumption 1(c), and lim r  0

more general sufficient conditions for welfare to rise from one equilibria to another. To achieve
this, we need a characterization of the term D.

Pro-competitive &

Herfindahl index

Thus, expenditure is decomposed into three terms: the first reflects the pro-competitive and
selection effects in lowering average prices; the second reflects the benefits of product variety;
while the third is the Herfindahl index. Having more dispersed expenditure shares will lower the
Herfindahl index and raise expenditure, thereby lowering welfare. That counter-intuitive result is
interpreted by Feenstra and Weinstein (2010) as reflecting “crowding” in product space.
For other values of r, we can still obtain a type of Herfindahl index by defining the
“adjusted” demand shares:
z (p) 

s (p)( p * / p )r /2



s ' (p)( p * / p ' )r /2d '

.

For the translog case, r = 0, these adjusted shares equal the conventional shares, while for the
quadratic case, r = 2, these adjusted demand shares equal the quantity share of each product.
Then defining the Herfindahl index, H   z (p)2 d , it is shown in the Appendix that,

where the final term is decreasing in the Herfindahl index H (since [ N  ( /  )] has the same
sign as r, from Assumption 1).
Recall that expenditure is er (p)  p * D(p)1/ r , from (9). As the reservation price falls,
then so does expenditure and welfare rises. But that gain is offset if the Herfindahl index also
falls. In the trade environments we shall consider, that result will be likely whenever variety
increases: while there is not a one-to-one correspondence between changes in the mass of
products N and the Herfindahl, in all cases that we examine an increase in N implies a lower
Herfindahl, which in turn implies an increase in D(p)1/ r . It follows that if expenditure falls, then
it falls by less than the reduction in the reservation price. The question is whether we achieve
some bound to this offsetting effect on welfare due to crowding in product space. That question
is answered in the affirmative, as shown by the following decomposition of expenditure:

Sufficient conditions for a fall in the cost of living and rise in welfare are that: (i) the reservation
price falls; and (ii) the Herfindahl index does not fall or the weighted-average price term on the
second line does not rise.

14
The first line of (11), obtained by substituting (10) into (9), has already been discussed.
It shows that if the reservation price is falling, but the Herfindahl index is also falling due to an
increase in variety, then the decline in the cost of living (and increase in welfare) will be less
than that in p*. We have referred to this outcome as a crowding effect. Now suppose that the
Herfindahl falls when comparing two equilibria, which will tend to increase the cost of living,
but that the reservation price also falls. Can we easily determine whether welfare rises or falls?
The second line of (11) gives an affirmative answer. Regardless of the change in the Herfindahl,
the cost of living falls and welfare rises if – along with the fall in the reservation price – the
share-weighted mean of order –r/2 shown on the second line does not rise. If the share-weighted
mean of prices is falling, then it follows that the decline in the cost of living and increase in
welfare exceeds the fall in

p * . So under these conditions, the changes in p* and

p*

effectively become bounds for the change in the cost of living.
In the next section we shall further decompose the reservation price into terms reflecting
(i) product variety, (ii) the markups charged by firms, and (iii) an average of firm costs. The
latter will reflect selection across firms. Using this decomposition in (11), we will obtain a
decomposition of the cost of living into the three potential sources of gains from trade, together
with an additional term (either the Herfindahl index or the share-weighted average of prices) that
essentially combines all of these effects.8

3. Autarky Equilibrium
We have already assumed that labor is the only factor of production, and now we
normalize the wage at unity. As in Melitz (2003), we assume that firms receive a random draw of
productivity denoted by  , so marginal costs are a /  , where a is the labor need per unit of
8

Substituting the reservation price from (2) into (11), we obtain a further decomposition of expenditure into terms
reflecting an exact price index similar to that in Diewert (1976), and changes in variety. See the Appendix.

15
output for a firm with the lowest productivity of   1. We will allow the Pareto distribution of
productivity to have either an upper-bound in its support, as in Helpman, Melitz and Rubenstein
(2008), or to be unbounded above:
Assumption 2
(a) The productivity distribution is Pareto, G ( )  (1    ) / (1  b ) , 1    b, where
the upper bound is b  (1, ] and  > max{0, –r};
(b) There is a sunk cost F of obtaining a productivity draw, but no fixed cost of production.
In part (a), we allow the Pareto distribution to be unbounded (b = ) or bounded (b < ). The
restriction that  > max{0,– r} becomes  > ( – 1) > 0 in the CES case, which is needed for
certain first moments to converge in that case; this restriction is needed here for the same reason.
The assumption that there is no fixed cost of production in (b) is made for convenience and
follows Melitz and Ottaviano (2008).
The optimal price for a firm with productivity  is p  ( a /  ) / (  1) . We follow
ACDR and let   p / ( a /  ) denote the ratio of price to marginal cost, while v  p * /(a /  )
denotes the ratio of the reservation price to marginal cost. From (6), the elasticity  ( p / p*) is a
function of the price relative to the reservation price, so  (  / v ) and using this notation the
markup of the firm is written as:

where the second expression follows from (6) and is used to solve for  ( v ) .9 Differentiating this
expression, it is shown in the Appendix that elasticity of the markup is 0  v  '( v ) /   1 , so that
The left side of the second expression can be evaluated at  =1 and  = v to show that it is above and below ½, so
that a solution   (1, v) where it equals ½ always exists.

16
changes in marginal cost are only partially passed-through to prices.
We can now write the equilibrium conditions in autarky. A firm paying the sunk cost of F
receives a draw of productivity  with probability g ( )  G '( ). We make a change of variables
from  to v. Since v  p * /(a /  ) then   av / p * , so using the Pareto distribution:
g ( )d 

(12)

This change of variables – suggested by ACDR – will considerably simplify our expressions.
Because there are no fixed costs of production, the lowest-productivity firm that will continue
production will have marginal costs equal to the reservation price, so v = 1 is the lower bound.
The upper bound for v, denoted by v*, is obtained when productivity is b  av / p * , so that:

v*  bp * / a.
Starting with the demand share d / D(p) from (7), we multiply that by expenditure L to
obtain total demand, and then by ( – 1)/ to obtain profits. Using the bounds v  [1, v*], the
expected profit from entering the market must equal the sunk costs of F in equilibrium, so that:

which also equals Ne[1 – G(a/p*)], where (a/p*) is the productivity of the firm with marginal
cost (a/) just equal to the reservation price. So as usual in the Melitz model, the mass of
surviving firms N equals the mass of entering firms times the probability of survival, and this
probability is equivalently written as [1 – G(a/p*)] = ( p * / a ) G ( v*) .
We have already used the condition that expenditure equals the workforce L, so that fullemployment holds. The remaining equilibrium condition is obtained from the reservation price in
(2), re-written slightly by dividing by p* and using the Pareto distribution from (12):

The solution to the equilibrium conditions (13)-(15) is summarized in the following result:
Proposition 2
Under Assumptions 1 and 2: (a) the autarky equilibrium conditions (13)-(15) have a positive
solution for p*, Ne and N; (b) if and only if b = , the solution for Ne is proportional to the
country size L, while the solution for N is independent of country size L.
The existence result in (a) relies on  > max{0, –r} in Assumption 2, so that the integrals
in (13) and (15) remain bounded even for v*. The results in part (b), when productivity is
unbounded, are obtained by inspection of the equilibrium conditions. In that case the upper-limit
of integration in (13) is infinite, so the two integrals are constant and (13) becomes
F  1L / N e . It is immediate that the mass of entrants is proportional to country size in this

18
case. This result is also obtained by ACDR, and follows from the “proportionality relation”
between expected profits from entering the market and expected revenue. While these two
variables are proportional for every firm in the CES case (i.e. regardless of productivity), they
are proportional in expected terms for the general demand system that we or ACDR adopt,
provided that the Pareto distribution is unbounded above and there are no fixed costs of
production. Those two assumptions ensure that the upper (v = ) and lower (v =1) limits of
integration in (13) are exogenous.
Part (b) gives a second implication of unbounded productivity that is less well known
than the linear relationship between entry and country size, and concerns the mass N of surviving
firms. Substituting (14) into (15), the equilibrium condition for the reservation price becomes:

which equals a positive constant on the left, from Assumption 1. For b =  and v*  bp * / a  ,
it follows that (16) solves uniquely for N, independent of p* and country size L. This surprising
result is also found by Arkolakis, Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2010) for the translog case, and
ACDR for their more general demand function. A related result has been shown by Baldwin and
Forslid (2010), who consider the Helpman, Melitz and Rubenstein (2008) model with CES
preferences and a bounded Pareto distribution for firm costs. They show that a reduction in
variable trade costs has no effect on the variety of products consumed when the fixed costs of
exporting and domestic production are equal: new import varieties reduce domestic varieties
one-for-one in that case. In contrast, we have excluded the CES case in Assumption 1 and also
exclude fixed costs, and find that product variety is independent of country size if and only if the
Pareto distribution is unbounded, b = . This finding will have strong implications for the

19
sources of gains from trade, examined in the following section.
Before turning to that discussion, we use the firm-level structure introduced in this
section to further decompose the cost of living. The reservation price in Lemma 1 can be written
as the product of terms that reflect the average of firm markups and costs, as follows:

Lemma 2
The reservation price in the closed economy is:

The first term appearing on the right of (17) is the same variety term appearing in (2). The
second term is a mean of order r/2 of the markups  ( v ) . To interpret the last term, recall that
v  p * /( a /  ) is the ratio of the reservation price to marginal cost, so p * / v  a /  is the
marginal cost of a firm with productivity  . The last term in (17) is therefore a mean of order r/2
of the marginal cost of firms. If all three terms in Lemma 2 fall and also the share-weighted price
term in Lemma 1 does not rise, then we are assured of a welfare gain. We now examine trade
environments allowing for such welfare gains.

4. Frictionless Trade
We initially consider frictionless trade, where in addition to the assumption of no fixed
costs of production or export, we also ignore variable costs of trade (while introducing such trade
costs in the next section). We suppose that the expenditure function in (1) along with
Assumptions 1 and 2 holds across countries. In this environment, moving from autarky to

20
frictionless trade is equivalent to growth in the labor force L. We have already shown in
Proposition 2 that with an unbounded Pareto distribution, product variety N does not change but
Ne rises in proportion to L. It follows that the probability of survival is falling, so there is a
positive selection effect: only firms with productivity above a higher cutoff level produce in the
larger market, while smaller firms are crowded out. Furthermore, this selection effect is the only
source of welfare gain in the larger market: variety N is independent of L and it will follow that
the Herfindahl index in (11) does not change; the average markup in (17) does not change
because the upper-limit of integration is v *  p*b/a   as b  ; and it follows from Lemmas
1 and 2 that only the fall in firms’ costs changes the reservation price and welfare.
When productivity is bounded, however, then we shall find that all three sources of gains
from country growth operate: variety increases, the average markup falls, and there is a positive
selection effect. To show this, we perform the comparative statics on (13)-(15). Differentiating
(14)-(15) and simplifying, we obtain:
d ln N e   (1  A)d ln p*,

21
To give the intuition for these results, consider the free entry condition (13). The markups
appearing in the numerator of this expression are increasing as the reservation price rises or
marginal cost falls,  '( v )  0 , and likewise for the Lerner index [  ( v )  1] /  ( v ). The rising
markup follows from the fact that the demand elasticity is increasing in price, as noted earlier. So
as the reservation price falls, the expected markup in the numerator of (13) falls relative to the
integral in the denominator. It follows that Ne rises less than proportionately with L. That is
shown in the first result in (18), where A > 0 for b <  from Assumption 1, while B > 0 for b < 
because the Lerner index takes on its highest value at the upper bound v*, so that:

The inequality states that the highest Lerner index exceeds its average, and then the equality
follows directly from the free entry condition (13) and ensures that B > 0 for b < .
When productivity is unbounded and b  , then A, B  0, and so in that case we have
d ln N e  d ln L , as asserted in Proposition 2(b). For unbounded productivity we also have that
the reservation price changes by d ln p*   d ln L /  in (18) and, as discussed above, this change
is purely due to the drop in the average of firm costs, i.e. the self-selection of more efficient
firms in the larger market.
When productivity is bounded, however, then the reservation price falls by less than
d ln L /  , as shown by (18) with A, B > 0 . That means that the increased selection of firms is

offset. We conclude that country growth has two opposing effects on product variety N: entry of
firms Ne rises less than proportionately with L; but also the reservation price falls by less, so the
increased selection is offset. It turns out that this second effect dominates so that product variety

22
N rises with L. This result can be seen from the equilibrium condition for the reservation price in
(16), where the left side is constant while the integral on the right is a weighted average of terms
that are increasing in v, so the integral is too (as shown in the Appendix). It follows with b   ,
a fall in v*  bp * / a is associated with a rise in N. These various results are summarized as:
Proposition 3
Under Assumptions 1 and 2, an increase in country size L under frictionless trade leads to:
(a) when b = , then p* falls only due to the drop in the average of firm costs, with the
Herfindahl index H fixed; (b) when b < , then variety N rises, the Herfindahl falls, and the
average of firm costs, markups and the weighted-average price term in (11) all fall; (c) the
proportional welfare gain when b <  is less than that with b = .

Part (a), with an unbounded Pareto distribution, has already been discussed above and the
constant Herfindahl is shown in the Appendix. The rise in product variety with bounded Pareto,
in part (b), has also been motivated by the comparative statics above and the falling Herfindahl is
shown in the Appendix. The fact that the average of firm costs and markups both fall follows
quite easily from those terms in (17): as the reservation price falls then so does v*  p*b/a, and
so we are excluding the highest markup term  ( v*) in (17); but because p* appears explicitly
within the integral of costs, we are also reducing the average of firm costs, as confirmed in the
Appendix. The hardest piece to prove is that the share-weighted mean price term appearing in
(11) also falls as country size increases, which together with the drop in the reservation price,
ensures that the representative consumer gains in the larger country.
Part (c) shows that despite the fact that all three sources of gains from trade operate in the
bounded Pareto case, the total proportional gains from trade are smaller with bounded than with
unbounded Pareto. This result follows from our welfare decomposition in Lemma 1 and the

23
comparative statics above. With b = , we found that d ln p*   d ln L /  and the Herfindahl
index is fixed, so it follows immediately from the first line of (11) that the increase in welfare is
d ln L /  . But with b < , we found above that d ln p*   d ln L /  , and we also confirm in the

Appendix that the Herfindahl index is falling as variety increases. For both reasons, if follows
that the frictionless trade leads to an increase in welfare that is less than d ln L /  , obtained in
the unbounded case.
The result in part (c) is related to that in Melitz and Redding (2013), who focus on the
CES case only. They show that, provided there are fixed costs of exporting, then the gains from
trade with heterogeneous firms exceed that with homogeneous firms as in the Krugman (1980)
model. Homogeneous firms are an extreme case of bounded Pareto where there is a mass point at
a single productivity. So Melitz and Redding (2013) are comparing any productivity distribution
for heterogeneous firms (including bounded or unbounded Pareto) with a degenerate distribution
with a single mass point. In comparison, we find that even without fixed costs of trade, the gains
from frictionless trade with unbounded Pareto exceed those with bounded Pareto for the QMOR
class of preferences. So we are comparing the unbounded Pareto case to any bounded Pareto (but
not including the degenerate case b = 1, ruled out in Assumption 2).
With this difference in our comparisons understood, the spirit of our results are similar:
having a greater spread of productivities leads to higher proportional gains from trade. That is an
especially surprising result in our context because by restricting the range of productivities we
give scope for additional sources of gains from trade – due to product variety and reduced
markups – that do not operate with the unbounded Pareto distribution. We have found with
unbounded Pareto that these additional sources of gains necessarily reduces the self-selection of
more efficient firms, so that the total proportional gains are lower.

24
This result can be usefully compared to the formula for welfare gains found by ACDR,
which emphasizes the share of total consumption purchased from the domestic market. Denoting
that fraction by , the domestic labor force by L , and the world labor force by L  L , then  =1
in autarky and  = L / L with frictionless trade. With growth it follows that d ln    d ln L  0.
Applying our result above that the welfare gain is  d ln p*  d ln L /  with unbounded Pareto,
but smaller with bounded Pareto, we have therefore proved:

Corollary 1
The gain from frictionless trade equals  d ln  /   0 with an unbounded Pareto distribution, but
is strictly less than this amount with a bounded Pareto distribution for productivity.

Our calculation of the gains from trade goes beyond ACDR by allowing for changes in product
variety and markups under a bounded Pareto distribution, even though it is their own formula
(obtained with unbounded Pareto) that becomes the upper bound.

5. Variable Trade Costs
We now allow for variable costs of trade, but for simplicity, will suppose that the trading
  2 denote the number of (identical) countries in the
countries are symmetric. We shall let C

world, but due to trade costs, each country does not necessarily trade with all others. We number
countries by their proximity to an exporter, so c = 1 denotes the local market, c = 2 denotes the
next closest market, etc. In equilibrium we allow for trade with whole countries or a fraction of a
country, as explained below. We shall assume the following structure of trade costs:
Assumption 3
Numbering countries by their proximity to an exporter, delivering one unit to country c means
.
that  (c )   0c   1 units must be sent, with  0  1,   0 and 1  c  C

25
These costs apply onto to cross-border trade, while local sales (c = 1) have   1. Notice that
number of countries c that a nation is trading with plays the same role in Assumption 3 as
distance does in an empirical specification of variable transport costs, while 0 plays the same
role as a “border effect,” i.e. the extra amount that must be sent regardless of distance. We can
briefly provide a micro-structure that justifies the trade costs described in Assumption 3.
  2 , with the
Suppose that countries are located evenly on a circle of circumference C

capital city at the center of each country. By construction, the capitals are distance ½ from each
  4. We assume that imported
border, as shown in Figure 1 for a circle of circumference C

goods must reach the capital city (e.g. an airport) before being costlessly dispersed throughout
the country. Then letting dist denote the distance a good travels to reach the border of an

importing country, the good travels (½+dist) to reach the capital city. We assume that the


variable trade costs are    0 ½  dist  . Since goods can enter from the border on either side,
if dist = 1 then the importer is trading with (c  1)  2 countries (not counting itself), while if dist
= 2 then the importer is trading with (c  1)  4 countries (not counting itself). Trade with a
fraction of a country is also allowed, as illustrated Figure 1 where country 1 is trading with a
fraction of countries 2 and 3 up to the “trading edge.” In general we solve for (c  1)  2dist so
that dist  (c  1) / 2 . Substituting this into the formula for trade costs we obtain:


 (c )   0 ½  dist    0 [½  (c  1) / 2]   0 2  c  .
Absorbing 2  into the border costs  0 , we obtain Assumption 3.

Equilibrium Conditions

With Assumption 3, we can readily solve for the number C of countries that each nation
trades with in the symmetric equilibrium. The most efficient firm in any country has marginal
labor costs of a/b to produce one unit of output. Normalizing the wage at unity in every country,
in equilibrium the marginal cost of producing enough to deliver one unit to the most distant
country C will just equal the reservation price in that country:

b

.
 0C  a  p * , for 1  C  C

(19)

This equilibrium condition provides a very simple relation between the border effect 0 and the
equilibrium number of trading partners. Of course, changes in the trade costs 0 will also affect
the reservation price in (19), so we will need to specify all the equilibrium conditions to account
for the endogenous response of both C and p*. Note that if the trade cost 0 are sufficiently close


 ( a / b)  p*, then the most efficient firm from
to unity and  is close enough to zero to have  0 C
.
each country sells to every market, so that C  C

27
To write the other equilibrium conditions with trade, we revisit the change in variables
introduced for the autarky economy. When a firm is selling to a foreign country, we let

From the final expression in (20), we see that higher trade costs  implies a lower density of
firms in any interval dv, which shows how the trade costs affect the extensive margin of
exporting firms. But in contrast to the unbounded Pareto case, trade costs now also affect the
intensive margin of exporters, and of the highest-productivity exporter in particular.
The upper bound for v when selling to the domestic market is still denoted by v*  bp * / a,
and the upper bound when selling to a foreign country c is:

v * / (c )  bp * / a (c ) .

(21)

With unbounded productivity, b  , the ratio of reservation price to marginal costs for foreign
firms – inclusive of the variable trade costs – is in the range [1,+), the same as for home firms.
So there is no difference in the distribution of marginal costs and prices charged by home and
foreign firms: both countries have firms with essentially zero costs, charging an infinite markup,
and firms with marginal costs equal to the reservation price, with zero markup. But with bounded
productivity, we see from (21) that the ratio of the reservation price to marginal costs is in the
range v/ [1, bp * / a ), which depends on the reservation price and trade costs. Now the price
of the highest productivity firm is affected by trade costs, and we refer to this as an impact on the
intensive margin of the highest productivity firm.

28
We continue to let N denote the total mass of products available to the representative
consumer in each country, so this notation from section 2 stands. But in section 3, dealing with
the autarky economy, we previously let Ne denote the mass of entering firms, while N was the
mass of surviving firms. With trade we need to introduce a new notation for the mass of firms in
a single country, so we now let Me denote the mass of entering firms in a single country, and M
denote the mass of surviving firms. These are related by the equilibrium condition (14), rewritten using this new notation as,

Conditional on selling at home, the probability of firms in the interval dv selling to country c is

changes in trade costs have two further effects: through changing the range of countries C that
are exporting to each destination; and through changing the mass of domestic products M.
While we will need to take into account all these effects, for the moment just concentrate
on the direct impact of trade costs on the mass of exporting firms and countries, holding fixed the
mass of domestic products M and also p*. The effect of changing trade costs on the number of
trading partners C can be obtained quite easily from the equilibrium condition (19). Using that
condition to solve for C, substituting the result into (23), and differentiating with respect to trade
costs while holding M and p* fixed, we can obtain:

This expression shows the partial effect of declining trade costs on expanding the range of
available products, through the extensive margin of exporting firms and countries. The result is
increasing in the number of trading partners C, because C (1  ) is increasing in C regardless of
the sign of 1– . In other words, the greatest impact of reducing trade costs on product variety

comes when a country is already trading with the most partners (C  C
comes exclusively from expanding the extensive margin of exporting firms rather than by
expanding the range of exporting countries.
Returning to the full equilibrium conditions, they are (19) for the number of trading
partners, (22) for the mass of domestically produced goods, and (23) for the mass of products
available to consumers. We still need the free entry condition analogous to (13) in the closed
economy, which is now written as:

(25)

To move from the free entry condition in the closed economy to the open economy in (24), we
have added the integrals over trading partners so that expected profits are computed over
domestic sales plus exports. We have introduced the notation J  [ f ] as a functional depending on

 , from the trade costs, that integrates any function f(v) over the densities of firms selling in the
domestic and all export markets. In each case, we use the density of these firms given by (12)
and (20), including the terms (p*/a) and (p*/a(c)) appearing in these densities, reflecting the
probability of selling domestically or exporting. Because these probabilities determine the mass
of firms, they influence the extensive margin. The similar terms v*  bp*/a and (v*/0) also
appear in (25) in the upper limits of integration, where they influence the intensive margin of the
highest-productivity firm selling at home and also exporting.
A final equilibrium condition is needed to solve for the reservation price, analogous to
(15), and rewritten by adding the integral over trading partners:

The first term on the right of (27) is identical to that in (17), where we continue to let N   d

denote the mass of products available to consumers in any country. The set  now includes both
domestic goods and imported products, and the integrals over these goods are taken using the
functionals J   f  and J  f  . The interpretation of the two other terms on the right is very
similar to what we had in the closed economy. The second term is the average over domestic and
foreign firms of their price-cost ratios  ( v ) . Recalling that v denotes the ratio of the reservation
price to a firm’s marginal cost, then p*/v is the firm’s marginal cost and the third term is the
average over all domestic and foreign firms of their marginal costs.

Change in Trade Costs

It is useful to start with the share of expenditure coming from domestic production, or .
Integrating over the demand shares in (17), we obtain in the symmetric equilibrium:

32
Of course, the mass of entering firms cancels in the numerator and denominator. The change in
this share due to a change in trade costs is greatly simplified if the functional in the denominator
is constant. In fact, there are two cases where that results holds:

Lemma 4

The functional J   f  is not affected by a change in trade costs if: (i) productivity is unbounded
or product is bounded and the derivative is calculated at the frictionless equilibrium; and (ii) the
change in the reservation price is d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 .

To establish this result, consider first the case where productivity is unbounded. The
,
upper limits of integration in (25) for v are , and the mass of trading partners becomes C  C

because some firm is efficient enough to export to every country. So (25) simplifies to:

Inverse of 

As we have already noted, with unbounded productivity there is no difference between the home
and foreign firms on the intensive margin (their range of prices and markups is the same), but
only on the extensive margin (reflecting the mass of home and foreign firms). It follows that the
share of consumption purchased from home firms is simply  = M/N, which equals the inverse
of the bracketed term in (29) and (30), as indicated.

(1  )

Thus, this functional is constant if d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 . To interpret this result, a drop in trade
costs lowers the reservation price, which reduce the value of the functional (over sales, markups,
or any other function f ) in the domestic market. But since d ln p*  d ln 0 , then exporters face
enhanced opportunities abroad since the drop in their trade costs exceeds the fall in the foreign
reservation prices. These two effects both operate on the extensive margin (reflecting the
probability of being a domestic firm or exporter in a range dv), and just cancel.
Surprisingly, we obtain the same result when we allow for bounded productivity and
introduce an intensive margin, provided that we evaluate the change in the functional around the
frictionless equilibrium with 0 = 1 and  = 0. Because we are evaluating derivatives with respect
to trade costs 0, it is mathematically correct to evaluate the equilibrium conditions at  = 0,
totally differentiate with respect to 0, and then evaluate at 0 = 1. This technique simplifies the
analysis considerably. In particular, at the frictionless equilibrium, any exporting firm will sell to

This result shows that the import competition created by the fall in trade costs and the
reservation price is just offset by the export opportunities created, so that the functional is
constant, when (34) holds. This is the same formula for the price change result that we found
above, for unbounded productivity, when evaluating the effect of trade costs on the extensive
margin only. Now we see that this result also holds when incorporating the intensive margin and
when evaluated at the frictionless equilibrium. In that case, the share of expenditure  is simply
, so that the change in the reservation price in (34) is once again d ln p*  (1   )d ln , as

we found with the unbounded Pareto.
We now argue that the change in the reservation price of d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 is in fact
the equilibrium change. This result follows because the various functionals appearing in the

35
equilibrium conditions are all (locally) constant. In the free entry condition (24), for example, the
functionals evaluate expected profits, and since these are constant it follows that the mass of
entrants in each country, Me, is constant in the denominator.12 Then from the equilibrium
condition (26), it is immediate that product variety N is constant. Furthermore, since the
denominator of (24) is the term D(p) introduced earlier, it is constant and then so is the
Herfindahl index. We confirm in the Appendix that these various results are enough to ensure
that the change in prices d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 is the equilibrium change. Finally, because the
Herfindahl index does not change, it follows from Lemma 1 the change in welfare equals
 d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 . We summarize these results with:
Proposition 4

Under Assumptions 1–3, a small reduction in trade costs implies the following results whether
productivity is unbounded or is bounded with the change evaluated at the frictionless equilibrium:
(a) no change in the mass of entrants Me, the mass of varieties N, or the Herfindahl index H;
(b) the same proportionate fall in the reservation price and rise in welfare of (1   )d ln 0 ,
which is due only to the selection of firms.
The final result in Proposition 4 – that only the selection effect operates around the
frictionless trade equilibrium – follows because the functionals defining the average markup in
Lemma 3 are locally constant so there is no change in the average markup. To interpret this
result, a drop in trade costs lowers the reservation price and therefore lowers the markups
charged by home firms, while the lowest-productivity firms exit. But since d ln p*  d ln 0 , then

12

That result may appear surprising in view of Proposition 2, which stated that country growth leads to more
entrants. But the worldwide mass of entrants that are potentially exporting to each country is still growing. We could
define that worldwide mass as Ne, computed as in (23) but with Me on the right. With a fall in trade costs, it would
follow that Ne is rising.

36
foreign exporters have a greater drop in their trade costs than in the home reservation price, and
they will raise their markups. That allows some low-productivity foreign firms to enter and begin
exporting to the home market. In the end, with unbounded productivity the home and foreign
markups are both in the range [1, +), before and after the drop in trade costs. The changes in
the extensive margin of domestic and foreign firms due to falling trade costs have no effect on
this distribution of markups, or on the average markup.
What we now find is that this result holds even with bounded productivity. In that case,
the markup charged by the highest productivity home firm is reduced, and the markup charged
by the highest productivity foreign exporter is increased. These changes in the intensive margin
also cancel when evaluated for a small change in trade costs at the frictionless equilibrium, so
there is no pro-competitive effect. In addition, we have found that the mass of varieties N is
locally constant, so that there is no variety effect either.
Because we already know the impact of a large change in trade costs from Proposition 3,
moving from autarky to frictionless trade, the results in Proposition 4 cannot hold for all
parameter values away from the frictionless equilibrium. Rather, for some parameter values we
must observe the same qualitative results as reported in Proposition 3:
Corollary 2

With bounded productivity, a reduction in trade costs 0 evaluated at some values of 0 >1 or

 > 0 leads to: (a) a fall in the reservation price and rise in welfare less than (1   )d ln 0 ;
(b) reduced gains due to the selection effect, but positive gains due to increased product variety
and a reduction in the average markup.
We have not established that the results in Corollary 2 hold for all values of 0 >1 and  > 0,
though we would conjecture that such a result holds.

37
There is one final result that differs for bounded and unbounded productivities, even at
the frictionless equilibrium. While we have found that d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 holds in either
case, that is not the formula used by ACR and ACDR to characterize the gains from reduced
trade costs. Rather, these authors focus on the change in the share of consumption coming from
domestic producers, or  in (28). We have already argued that the functional in the denominator
of this expression is constant with unbounded productivity, and locally constant with bounded
productivity. So given the change in the reservation price d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 , the change in 
comes from the numerator only, and is readily calculated as:

With unbounded productivity, since lim v* g ( v*)v*  0 we obtain the formula for welfare gain
found by ACR and ACDR,  d ln p*   d ln  /  . With bounded productivity, however, the fall
in the share of consumption coming from home production exceeds that obtain with unbounded
productivity. It follows that the formula  d ln  /  now overstates the welfare gains from
reducing trade costs:
Corollary 3

The gain from a small reduction in trade costs equals  d ln  /   0 with an unbounded Pareto
distribution for productivity, but is strictly less than this amount with a bounded Pareto
distribution when evaluated at the frictionless equilibrium.

This result is very similar in spirit to Corollary 1, and shows that the formula for gains from trade
from ACDR holds as an upper bound in the two cases we have considered: a large reduction in

38
trade costs from autarky to frictionless trade; and a small reduction in trade costs when evaluated
at the frictionless equilibrium.
To explain why the share of share of consumption coming from home production falls
more when productivity is bounded, we note that the fall in the mass of surviving domestic firms
M is also larger with bounded productivity, since from (22) we obtain (with Me fixed):


The fall in the mass of domestic firms due to a reduction in trade costs is therefore d ln M 

 d ln p*   (1   )d ln 0  0 when productivity is unbounded. From the above equation,
domestic varieties fall even more when productivity is bounded (and evaluated at the frictionless
equilibrium). We interpret that extra drop in the mass of firms as resulting from the extra import
competition in the intensive margin, as applies when productivity is bounded.

6. Conclusions

Our goal in this paper has been to evaluate the gains from trade when firm markups are
endogenous. To achieve that, we have introduced a quite general class of preferences represented
by the quadratic mean of order r expenditure function, due to Diewert (1976). Prior applications
of this expenditure/cost function have been mainly empirical, i.e. estimating the function for
specific values of the parameter r. In that case, the concavity and other properties of the function
are checked at the estimated parameters. For theoretical purposes, we want to ensure that the
function is globally well behaved. We have shown that this is the case for a symmetric function
and the parameter values in Assumption 1.
Despite the general class of preferences we use, however, the crucial feature of the model
allowing for multiple sources of gains from trade comes from the supply side of the model. With

39
heterogeneous firms, the very simple result of Krugman (1979) linking a drop in the markup to
(frictionless) trade no longer applies necessarily. We have shown that this result does not apply
when the distribution of firm productivity is Pareto and the support is unbounded above,
allowing for infinite productivity and zero costs. That assumption was not part of the Melitz
(2003) model, but was introduced by Chaney (2008), enabling him to derive a “distorted” gravity
equation even with heterogeneous firms. In the absence of fixed costs, we have found that this
distribution rules out a pro-competitive gain from trade and also rules out any variety gain,
suggesting that alternative forms for the productivity distribution should be investigated. Here
we have focused on the Pareto distribution with a support that is bounded above. It is know from
the work of Helpman, Melitz and Rubenstein (2008) that this distribution allows for a tractable
gravity equation, at least in its empirical specification, and we have shown that it can also be
used to obtain theoretical results.
We have investigated two case of trade liberalization. The first, following Krugman
(1979), was growth in country size. That exercise is meant to capture the movement from
autarky to frictionless trade with another country. Equivalently, we can think of trade costs
falling from some high level leading to autarky to zero, so the results for this case correspond to
a large change in trade costs. We found in Proposition 3 that the product variety and procompetitive gains from trade operate if and only if productivity is bounded above. This result
shows that the main analytical results of ACDR, who assume that productivity is unbounded, are
quite special and only allow for gains due to firm selection. Despite that limitation, their formula
applies as an upper bound to the proportional gains obtained from frictionless trade when
productivity is bounded and all three types of gains operate. When variety and pro-competitive

40
gains operate (due to bounded productivity), then the selection effect is sufficiently offset that
the total gains from trade are reduced.
The second case we have investigated is a small change in trade costs in a symmetric
equilibrium. When productivity is unbounded then this small change can be evaluated in the
presence of trade frictions, but when productivity is bounded then we focus on a small change
around the frictionless equilibrium. In both cases, we find the import competition due to the a
reduction in trade costs is just offset by the export opportunities created. For example, the fall in
domestic markups is just offset by a rise in foreign markups, so that the average markup does not
change. More generally, the fall in trade costs has no impact on the entry of domestic firms,
product variety available to consumers, or on the average markup, so that the gains from trade
are due entirely to the exit of less efficient firms. If productivity is bounded and we move away
from the frictionless equilibrium, then the product variety and pro-competitive gains must come
back into play.
There are a number of directions for further research. First, the two cases of trade
liberalization we have examined did not take advantage of the geography of trade and trade costs
illustrated in Figure 1: with finite reservation prices, bounded productivity and positive trade
costs, there will be countries not trading with each other. In contrast, the two cases we
considered implied that each country trades with all others (since either there is a firm productive
enough to do so, or with bounded productivity we evaluated the change in trade costs at the
frictionless equilibrium). We suggested in the previous section that even when countries trade
with all others, there is still a potentially large impact of trade liberalization on variety through
the extensive margin of exporting firms. Still, it would be of interest to examine how product
variety changes when new countries begin exporting, especially since that is the focus of the

41
empirical work in Broda and Weinstein (2006) and is very easily measured in the trade data.
Second, we have not allowed for fixed costs of domestic production or exporting. The
presence of such fixed costs would make the lowest profitable marginal cost endogenous (instead
of unity as used here because we divide marginal cost by the reservation price). That change
alone would re-introduce the product variety and pro-competitive channels as potential channels
of gain. While it is challenging to allow for fixed costs and the QMOR demand system in
general, its formulation is simplified in the translog case, which deserves more attention. Of
course, with fixed costs then we should also allow these costs to fall as an alternative force
leading to increased trade, and evaluate the gains.
Finally, while the bounded Pareto given us a particularly sharp comparison with the
unbounded case, we should also allow for other distributions for firm productivity. Head, Mayer
and Thoenig (2013) argue that the log-normal distribution offers a better approximation to actual
firm sizes than the Pareto. Edmond, Midrigan and Xu (2012) allow for a “double” Pareto as a
way to better approximate the actual distribution, and Holmes, Hsu and Lee (2013) also
investigate distributions other than the Pareto. These authors show that the pro-competitive gains
from trade tend to be greater outside the unbounded Pareto case, while Feenstra and Weinstein
(2010) estimate these gains for the United States without making any assumption on the
distribution. For all these reasons, we expect that future literature will be less likely to adopt the
unbounded Pareto case as representative when investigating the gains from trade.

If a finite limit exists, then the expression in curly brackets must approach unity, so its natural
log approaches zero. In that case, we can use the approximation ln(1  x )  x , which will be

which gives the result shown in the main text since the above limit is ln( p / p*) . Having
established these translog properties referred to in the main text, we prove all remaining results
for the QMOR function with r  0, appealing to continuity to establish them for r = 0.

Proof of Proposition 1:
(a) Consider the expenditure function (3) for r < 2, r  0 , with the set of available goods defined
by    | p  p * using the reservation price in (2). Multiplying all prices (including prices
for goods not available and also p*) by  > 0 has no effect on , so that er ( p)   er (p) in (3)

44
and the expenditure function is homogeneous of degree one. We have already confirmed in the
text that demand in non-negative, so that the expenditure function is non-decreasing in prices,
and strictly positive for expenditure on a non-empty set of goods. The remaining condition we
need to confirm is concavity in prices, which is shown in several steps.
`

Letting    ln q /  ln p denote the elasticity of demand from (6), we argued in the

main text that   1  r  0 for r  1 and also   0 for 1  r  2 We use these conditions to
establish the concavity of the expenditure function. It is convenient to use the following
characterization of concavity for a function defined over Rn, but which we apply to the
expenditure function defined over a continuum of prices:
Lemma A1 (Marshall and Olkin, 1979, p. 446): Let SRn be an open convex set, φ: S → R. For
x, yS, define the one variable function f() = φ(x+(1–)y) on the interval (0, 1). Then φ is
concave on S if and only if f is concave on (0, 1) for all x, yS .
Following this Lemma, we consider prices p ( )   p  (1   ) p and reservation prices
p * ( ) obtained by using p ( ) in (2), along with     | p  p * ( ) . Then from (3),

,

where A   / [ N  ( N  ( /  ))] . Small changes in the set   have no effect on expenditure
because these borderline goods have zero demand. So differentiating, we obtain:

where the first equality uses p * ( ) from (2) and the second uses demand q ( ) defined as in
(4) using prices p ( ) and utility u. With fixed income, utility depends on prices and . For
example, with income of unity, utility is u  1 / er ( p  (1   )p' ). Using the first expression
above to again differentiate e1r  r , and the second expression to differentiate q ( ) holding
utility fixed, we obtain :

Exact price index without variety

This final expression for the cost of living consists of a term that declines as product variety
rises, and an exact price index without accounting for variety. This formula for the exact price
index is very similar to that found in Diewert (1976, p. 131), and can be shown to be identical to
that formula for the symmetric case we are considering here. QED

where the second line follows by inspection of d(1/v) in (7). Using g ( v )   v  1 / (1  b ) and

 > max{0,–r} from Assumption 2, it is readily confirmed by computing the last two integrals
above that they are bounded above even as v*  bp * / a  . Both the integrals in the numerator
are increasing in v*, using Assumption 1, and the first term on the right of (A4) approaches
infinity as p*  . It follows that the right side of (A4) approaches infinity as p*  .
We next consider p*0. Since the first integral in the numerator of (A4) is less than the
integral in the denominator, their ratio is less than unity. The second integral in the numerator of
(A4) approaches zero as v*  bp * / a  0. It follows that the right-hand side approaches zero as

49
p*  0. Therefore, there will exist a value for p*  (0, ) such that (A4) holds, and this is the
equilibrium value. Then N is computed from (16) and Ne from (14). Part (b) is proved in the
main text. QED

second line cancel. When b = , then we are left with two integrals with an upper limit of
integration of v* = , and the ratio of these integrals are independent of p* and Ne . Therefore,
the Herfindahl is fixed.

This inequality holds because (1) = 1, while (v)/v declines to (v*)/v* < 1 for v* > 1, and

Lemma A2 ensures that this decline in monotonic. It follows that the term in square brackets in

holds globally. To confirm (A6) locally, we substitute for 'v/ using Lemma A2 and
differentiate using  '( v )  0 , obtaining a long polynomial involving r and . It can be confirmed
that the polynomial is negative, so that with  '( v )  0 , then the positive sign in (A6) is obtained.

so that Lemma 3 is established. QED

Proof of Proposition 4:
We need to prove that the change in price d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 is the equilibrium change, and
will do so by also showing that Me and N are constant. It will follow that the term D(p) in the
denominator of (24) is constant, and it follows that the Herfindahl index is also constant. From
Lemma 1 the change in welfare equals therefore equals  d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 .
(i) Consider first the case of unbounded productivity. By integrating over trade costs, the free
entry condition (24) becomes:

The term involving trade costs in brackets cancels in the numerator and denominator as does the
term (p*/a). The remaining integrals are constant because their upper-limits do not depend on
p* or trade costs. It follows immediately that the mass of entering firms Me is constant.
Likewise using v*  and v*/(c)  , condition (26) becomes:

where the first equality follows by evaluating the integrals in (26), the second follows from using

56
M = Me(p*/a) , and the third line follows from using (30). Again, the final integral is constant
because its upper-limit does not depend on p* or trade costs. From this condition we therefore
uniquely solve for product variety N available to consumers, independent of trade costs. Then
differentiating the first equality in (A7) for fixed N and Me, we obtain:

It follows that d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 is the equilibrium change in the reservation price.
(ii) Next, consider the case of bounded productivity. We will argue that d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0
satisfies all the equilibrium conditions and implies that Me and N are locally constant around the
frictionless equilibrium. We have already argued in the text that d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 implies
that the functional on the right of (26) is locally constant, so that:

To move from the first line to the second, it is readily confirmed from the definition of h( 0 , v*)
that the final derivative is zero when evaluated at 0 = 1, while the derivative with respect to 0 is
as shown. The second term on the second line is obtained by substituting d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0
 and using the Pareto distribution to evaluate g(v*)v*/G(v*). It is readily seen that
with   1 / C

the second and third terms sum to zero, so that the final line is obtained. From Assumption 1 we
have [ N  ( /  )]  0, so the only way that d ln N  d ln M e is consistent with (A8) is if
d ln N  d ln M e  0. It follows that these are the equilibrium changes, in conjunction with
d ln p*  (1   )d ln 0 . QED
