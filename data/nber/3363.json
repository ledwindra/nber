It develops a Tobit model as well as a structural model to analyze the determinants of this decision. The main determinants of the amount of time given to parents appear to be the parent's age, reported health, and institutionalization status, and the children's age, health, and sex. Older parents, less healthy parents, and non-institutionalized parents receive more time from their children, while younger children, healthier children, and female children provide more time. In contrast to these demographic determinants, economic variables, such as children's wage rate and income levels, appear to play a rather insignificant role in the provision of time. In addition, the evidence does not support the hypothesis that parents  purchase time from their children.\n\n",
