Moral Hazard and Economies of Scope in Physician Ownership of Complementary Medical
Services

                                              ABSTRACT

When physicians own complementary medical service facilities such as clinical laboratories and imaging
centers, they gain financially by referring patients to these service entities. This situation creates an
incentive for the physician to exploit the consumers’ trust by recommending more services than they
would demand under full information. This moral hazard cost, however, may be offset by gains in
economies of scope if the complementary services are integrated into the physician’s practice. We
assess the extent of moral hazard and economies of scope using data from Taiwan, which introduced
a “separating” policy, similar to the Stark Law in the US, that restricts physician ownership of pharmacies
unless they are fully integrated into the physician’s practice. We find that physicians who own pharmacies
prescribe 7.6% more drugs than those who do not own pharmacies. Overall, we find no evidence of
economies of scope from integration in the treatment of patients with acute respiratory infections,
diabetes, or hypertension. Overall the separating policy was ineffective at controlling drug costs as
a large number of physicians choose to integrate pharmacies into their practices in order to become
exempt from the policy.

1. Introduction	  

	                      Consumers	   often	   turn	   to	   experts	   for	   advice	   when	   they	   have	   difficulty	   discerning	   the	  
extent	   to	   which	   goods	   and	   services	   meet	   their	   needs	   such	   as	   in	   cases	   of	   automotive	   and	  
appliance	  repair,	  engineering	  services,	  financial	  services,	  and	  medical	  care.	  These	  experts	  
not	   only	   give	   advice	   but	   also	   sell	   goods	   and	   services	   to	   consumers	   based	   on	   that	   advice.	  
This	   situation	   creates	   an	   incentive	   for	   the	   expert	   to	   exploit	   consumers’	   trust	   and	  
recommend	   more	   services	   than	   they	   would	   demand	   under	   full	   information	   (Taylor	   1995	  
and	   Wolinsky	   1993).	   This	   moral	   hazard	   cost,	   however,	   maybe	   offset	   by	   gains	   in	   economies	  
of	  scope	  from	  the	  diagnostician	  also	  providing	  the	  services	  (Afendulis	  and	  Kessler	  2007).	  	  
	                      This	   moral	   hazard	   inherent	   in	   such	   “credence”	   goods	   is	   present	   in	   physician	  
ownership	   of	   complementary	   medical	   service	   facilities	   such	   as	   clinical	   laboratories,	  
imaging	   centers	   (i.e.,	   X-­‐rays,	   CAT	   scans	   and	   MRIs),	   pharmacies	   and	   physical	   therapy	  
centers.	   Physicians	   gain	   financially	   by	   referring	   patients	   to	   a	   complementary	   service	   entity	  
in	   which	   the	   physician	   has	   a	   financial	   interest.	   Patients,	   who	   rely	   on	   physicians	   for	   medical	  
advice,	   have	   little	   incentive	   to	   reject	   prescribed	   procedures	   especially	   when	   insurance	  
covers	   most	   of	   the	   cost.	   Because	   patients	   have	   imperfect	   information	   on	   the	   scope	   of	   the	  
problem,	   diagnosticians	   have	   incentive	   to	   recommend	   procedures	   that	   are	   profitable	  
regardless	  of	  their	  cost	  or	  appropriateness.	  	                                                                                                                                                                                                    	  
	                      To	  combat	  these	  moral	  hazard	  or	  “self	  referral”	  abuses,	  Congress	  passed	  the	  Stark	  
Law	   in	   1989,	   which	   prohibits	   physician	   referrals	   of	   Medicare	   and	   Medicaid	   patients	   to	  
complementary	  care	  facilities	  in	  which	  the	  physician	  or	  members	  of	  the	  physician’s	  group	  
have	   a	   financial	   interest.1	  The	   Law	   has	   a	   “safe	   harbor”	   exception	   that	   permits	   physicians	   to	  
escape	  prohibition	  if	  the	  self-­‐referral	  is	  for	  services	  provided	  within	  physician	  offices	  by	  a	  
“bona	   fide	   employee.”	   In	   other	   words,	   the	   Law	   draws	   a	   distinction	   between	   permissible	  
referrals	   made	   within	   an	   integrated	   firm	   and	   impermissible	   referrals	   made	   to	   outside	  
entities.	   Presumably,	   the	   exception	   for	   integrated	   organizations	   is	   based	   on	   potential	  
economies	   of	   scope	   from	   the	   joint	   production	   of	   physician	   and	   complementary	   medical

services.	   Indeed,	   economies	   of	   scope	   may	   arise	   from	   better	   coordination	   of	   care	   and	  
thereby	  improve	  patient	  outcomes	  (Afendulis	  and	  Kessler,	  2007).	  	  
	                  However,	  the	  safe	  harbor	  exception	  also	  allows	  physicians	  to	  circumvent	  the	  intent	  
of	  the	  Stark	  law	  by	  integrating	  complementary	  services	  directly	  into	  their	  practices.	  In	  fact,	  
there	   has	   been	   massive	   integration	   of	   such	   services	   into	   physician	   groups	   since	   the	  
enactment	  of	  the	  Stark	  Law	  (Tynan	  et	  al.,	  2008,	  United	  States	  Government	  Accountability	  
Office,	  2008).	  For	  instance,	  over	  the	  last	  two	  decades	  27%	  of	  physician	  groups	  expanded	  in-­‐
office	  imaging	  services.	  2	  And	  Medicare	  spending	  for	  imaging	  services	  increased	  on	  average	  
13%	  per	  year,	  with	  over	  two-­‐thirds	  of	  the	  spending	  occurring	  in	  physician	  office	  settings.3	  
	                  Policy	  makers	  are	  keenly	  aware	  of	  the	  problems	  with	  the	  exemption.	  The	  Medicare	  
Patient	  Advisory	  Commission	  recently	  proposed	  extensive	  changes	  to	  limit	  the	  exemption.	  
And	   the	   Center	   for	   Medicare	   and	   Medicaid	   Services	   recommended	   that	   physicians	   who	  
make	  self-­‐referrals	  must	  disclose	  their	  financial	  interests	  to	  patients	  in	  a	  June,	  2010	  Report	  
to	  Congress	  under	  the	  Patient	  Protection	  and	  Affordable	  Care	  Act	  of	  2010.	  
	                  In	  this	  paper,	  we	  use	  data	  from	  Taiwan	  to	  estimate	  the	  moral	  hazard	  costs	  and	  gains	  
from	   economies	   of	   scope	   associated	   with	   physician	   ownership	   of	   pharmacies.	   For	  
identification,	   we	   exploit	   a	   policy	   prohibiting	   physicians	   from	   owning	   pharmacies	   and	  
dispensing	   drugs	   that	   was	   phased	   in	   geographically	   over	   time.	   The	   “separating”	   policy	  
included	  a	  safe	  harbor	  exemption	  for	  physician	  groups	  that	  have	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  with	  a	  
licensed	   pharmacist	   integrated	   into	   their	   practice,	   which	   is	   identical	   to	   the	   safe	   harbor	  
provision	  in	  the	  Stark	  Law.	  	  
	                  Our	  analysis	  is	  made	  possible	  by	  a	  novel	  data	  set	  the	  links	  patient	  claims	  over	  time	  
to	  medical	  care	  providers	  for	  the	  universe	  of	  patients	  and	  providers.	  	  Taiwan	  is	  a	  country	  
with	   OECD	   level	   income	   and	   health	   status	   indicators.	   It	   also	   has	   a	   sophisticated	   health	   care	  
delivery	   system	   with	   a	   universal	   single-­‐payer	   health	   insurance	   system	   similar	   to	   Canada	  
(Lu	  and	  Hsiao,	  2003).	  The	  single	  payer	  insurance	  plan	  maintains	  individual	  claims	  data	  that	  
can	  be	  linked	  over	  time	  and	  to	  providers.

	                      We	   estimate	   that	   the	   separating	   policy	   significantly	   reduced	   drug	   expenditures	  
among	  physicians	  that	  did	  not	  have	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy.	  However,	  the	  effect	  of	  the	  policy	  
on	   reducing	   the	   total	   costs	   of	   care	   was	   substantially	   smaller	   for	   a	   number	   of	   reasons.	   First,	  
physicians	   responded	   by	   increasing	   the	   overprovision	   of	   self-­‐referred	   diagnostic	   services	  
not	  covered	  by	  the	  policy.	  Second,	  more	  than	  half	  of	  the	  physician	  groups	  (clinics)	  already	  
had	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  prior	  to	  the	  policy	  and	  therefore	  were	  exempt.	  Third,	  close	  to	  40%	  
of	   the	   clinics	   that	   did	   not	   have	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy	   prior	   to	   the	   policy	   integrated	   onsite	  
pharmacies	  into	  their	  practices	  after	  the	  implementation	  of	  the	  policy.	  	  	  
	                      Our	   results	   show	   that	   policymakers	   are	   correct	   to	   be	   concerned	   about	   physicians	  
referring	  patients	  to	  an	  entity	  in	  which	  they	  have	  a	  financial	  interest.	  We	  find	  evidence	  of	  
significant	  moral	  hazard	  as	  owning	  a	  pharmacy	  increased	  physician	  drug	  prescriptions	  by	  
7.6%.	  In	  contrast,	  we	  find	  no	  evidence	  to	  support	  any	  gains	  due	  to	  economies	  of	  scope	  from	  
the	   integration	   of	   pharmacies	   into	   physician	   offices.	   First,	   integration	   failed	   to	   create	  
efficiency	   savings;	   indeed,	   it	   generated	   the	   opposite	   result,	   as	   moral	   hazard	   effects	  
dominate.	  Second,	  integration	  did	  not	  improve	  adherence	  to	  medication	  prescriptions	  for	  
patients	  with	  the	  chronic	  diseases	  diabetes	  and	  hypertension.	  Finally,	  we	  find	  no	  effect	  of	  
integration	  on	  preventable	  adverse	  medical	  events	  in	  the	  treatment	  of	  patients	  with	  acute	  
respiratory	  infections,	  diabetes,	  and	  hypertension.	  This	  the	  safe	  harbor	  exception	  severely	  
limited	  the	  policy’s	  effectiveness	  as	  physicians	  exploited	  the	  loophole	  to	  be	  able	  to	  continue	  
to	  engage	  in	  profitable	  self-­‐referrals	  without	  any	  off	  setting	  gains	  from	  economies	  of	  scope.	  
	                      Our	   work	   makes	   several	   contributions	   to	   the	   understanding	   of	   health	   care	   markets.	  
First,	   we	   among	   the	   first	   to	   provide	   empirical	   evidence	   of	   a	   causal	   role	   of	   self-­‐referral	  
incentives	  in	  the	  overprovision	  of	  complementary	  medical	  care	  services.4	  Second,	  our	  work	  
is	  among	  the	  first	  to	  empirically	  examine	  policies	  such	  as	  the	  Stark	  Law	  that	  regulate	  self-­‐
referrals	  abuse.	  Third,	  our	  work	  is	  first	  to	  examine	  the	  effect	  of	  policies	  such	  as	  the	  Stark	  
Law	  on	  the	  organizational	  structure	  of	  the	  industry.

       	  Most	  of	  the	  work	  reports	  cross-­‐sectional	  correlations	  that	  are	  consistent	  with	  the	  overtreatment	  hypothesis.
For example see Childs and Hunter (1972), Strasser et al (1987), Hillman et al (1990, 1995, 1992), Aronovitz (1994),
Mitchell and Sass (1995), Gazelle et al (2007), Mitchell (2005) and Mitchell	  (2008).	  One	  important	  exception	  is	  
Iizuka	  (2007)	  who	  shows	  that	  physicians	  who	  dispense	  their	  own	  drugs	  in	  Japan	  take	  a	  drug’s	  markup	  into	  
account	  in	  prescription	  decisions.

	          Our	  work	  also	  contributes	  to	  the	  more	  general	  literature	  on	  moral	  hazard	  concerns	  
that	   arise	   in	   credence	   good	   markets.	   Chevalier	   and	   Ellison	   (1997)	   find	   that	   mutual	   fund	  
managers	  often	  try	  to	  increase	  the	  inflow	  of	  funds	  against	  the	  interests	  of	  their	  customers.	  
Hubbard	   (1998,	   2002)	   investigates	   the	   California	   vehicle	   emissions	   inspection	   market	  
where	   inspectors	   also	   provide	   repairs	   to	   help	   vehicles	   pass.	   Levitt	   and	   Syverson	   (2008)	  
show	  that	  homes	  owned	  by	  real	  estate	  agents	  sell	  for	  higher	  prices	  than	  comparable	  homes	  
owned	   by	   non-­‐agents.	   Gruber	   and	   Owings	   (1996)	   document	   a	   negative	   relationship	  
between	  birth	  rate	  and	  Cesarean	  section	  delivery	  as	  evidence	  of	  physician-­‐induced	  demand	  
for	  costly	  procedures.	  	  Iizuka	  (2007)	  shows	  that	  physicians	  who	  dispense	  their	  own	  drugs	  
in	   Japan	   take	   a	   drug’s	   markup	   into	   account	   in	   prescription	   decisions. Finally,	   Afendulis	   and	  
Kessler	  (2007)	  examine	  the	  tradeoffs	  between	  moral	  hazard	  and	  economies	  of	  scope	  in	  the	  
joint	  production	  of	  diagnosis	  and	  treatment	  of	  cardiac	  conditions.	  

2.          Conceptual	  Framework	  

            We	  model	  the	  prohibition	  against	  self-­‐referrals	  as	  a	  fee	  reduction	  in	  complementary	  
services	   that	   the	   physician	   prescribes	   (recommends)	   to	   patients.	   Suppose	   physicians	  
prescribe	   two	   types	   of	   complementary	   services:	   (1)	   services	   that	   are	   subject	   to	   the	  
prohibition	  such	   as	   drugs	   and	   (2)	   services	   that	   are	   not	   subject	   to	   the	   prohibition	   such	   as	  
imaging.	   	   Physician	   income	   from	   complementary	   services	   can	   be	   represented	   simply	   as	  
𝑌 = 𝑁 𝜋! 𝑠! 𝑤! + 𝜋! 𝑠! 𝑤! 	  where	   N	   is	   the	   number	   of	   patients	   she	   sees,	  𝜋! 	  is	   the	   profit	  
margins	  for	  service	  i,	  and	  𝑠! 	  is	  the	  quantity	  of	  service	  i	  provided,	  which	  depend	  on	  wi	  –	  the	  
amount	  of	  overtreatment.	  If	  the	  physician	  provides	  the	  clinically	  appropriate	  level	  of	  care,	  
then	  the	  level	  of	  overtreatment	  is	  zero.	  
            Physicians	   gain	   income	   from	   over-­‐treating	   patients,	   but	   pay	   a	   cost	   in	   terms	   of	  
disutility.	   Before	   the	   prohibition,	   the	   equilibrium	   amount	   of	   overtreatment	   equates	   the	  
marginal	   income	   from	   overtreatment	   of	   each	   service	   to	   the	   marginal	   disutility	   from	   total	  
overtreatment.	  The	  prohibition	  reduces	  the	  profit	  margin	  for	  drugs,	  𝜋! ,	  to	  zero.	  In	  this	  case,	  
the	   physician	   prescribes	   only	   the	   amount	   of	   drugs	   needed	   and	   overprovision	   of	   drugs	   is	  
zero.	   However,	   the	   physician	   increases	   over-­‐provision	   of	   non-­‐prohibited	   services	   from	  
which	  she	  still	  has	  a	  positive	  return.	  	  



                                                                               4
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	  


            Physicians	   with	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy	   are	   de	   jure	   exempt	   from	   the	   prohibition	   and	  
there	  is	  no	  impact	  of	  the	  policy	  on	  their	  overprovision	  of	  drugs.	  One	  option	  for	  those	  that	  
do	   not	   have	   onsite	   pharmacy	   is	   for	   them	   to	   legally	   circumvent	   the	   prohibition	   policy	   by	  
integrating	   a	   pharmacy	   into	   their	   practice.	   However,	   having	   a	   pharmacy	   requires	   paying	  
the	  fixed	  costs	  that	  include	  salary,	  space,	  equipment,	  and	  training.	  	  	  
            The	   physician	   integrates	   a	   pharmacy	   into	   her	   medical	   practice	   if	   the	   profits	   from	  
having	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy	   are	   larger	   than	   not	   having	   one.	   	   The	   net	   income	   from	  
integration	   is	  𝑌 !! = 𝑁 𝜋! 𝑠! 𝑤!∗ + 𝜋! 𝑠! 𝑤!∗                       − 𝐹,	   where	   F	   is	   the	   fixed	   cost	   of	   having	   a	  
pharmacy	  and	  𝑤!∗ 	  is	  the	  optimal	  overprovision.	  The	  income	  generated	  without	  a	  pharmacy	  
is	   𝑌 !" = 𝑁𝜋! 𝑠! 𝑤!! 	  where	   𝑤!! 	  is	   the	   optimal	   overprovision	   under	   the	   prohibition.	   A	  
physician,	  then,	  hires	  a	  pharmacy	  if	  𝑌 !! − 𝑌 !" > 0,	  which	  translates	  into	  

                                                                      F
                                       𝑁>                                                                        .                                                                                                (1)	  
                                                π1 s1 w1*       +π2 s2 w2* -­‐π2 s2 w2'
	  
The	  physician	  will	  integrate	  if	  the	  number	  of	  patients	  is	  larger	  than	  the	  fixed	  cost	  divided	  
by	  the	  per-­‐patient	  marginal	  profit	  from	  having	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy.	  The	  larger	  the	  fixed	  
costs	  and	  the	  lower	  the	  return	  to	  overprovision,	  the	  greater	  the	  number	  of	  patients	  
required	  for	  integration	  to	  be	  profitable.	  In	  other	  words,	  there	  needs	  to	  be	  sufficient	  scale	  
to	  be	  able	  to	  cover	  the	  fixed	  costs.	  
            The	  framework	  provides	  us	  with	  a	  number	  of	  empirically	  testable	  predictions.	  First,	  
the	   prohibition	   policy	   will	   reduce	   drug	   prescriptions	   by	   physicians	   in	   clinics	   that	   do	   not	  
have	   a	   pharmacy	   on	   site.	   Second,	   moral	   hazard	   from	   self-­‐referral	   incentives	   is	   the	  
difference	   in	   drug	   expenditures	   for	   patients	   who	   are	   treated	   by	   physicians	   with	   and	  
without	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy.	  Third,	  the	  policy	  will	  increase	  the	  over-­‐provision	  of	  other	  non-­‐
prohibited	   complementary	   services	   meaning	   that	   any	   efficiency	   gains	   from	   reducing	  
unnecessary	   drug	   prescriptions	   will	   be	   at	   least	   partially	   offset	   by	   increases	   in	   other	  
services.	   Third,	   the	   exemption	   to	   the	   prohibition	   gives	   clinics	   an	   incentive	   to	   integrate	  
pharmacies	  into	  their	  practice	  to	  circumvent	  the	  prohibition	  if	  they	  have	  sufficient	  patient	  
volume	  to	  cover	  the	  fixed	  costs.

3. Institutional	  Context	  

	         Taiwan	  is	  a	  country	  of	  23	  million	  people	  that	  has	  an	  advanced	  market	  economy	  with	  
a	  per	  capita	  GDP	  of	  US$32,200.	  Taiwan’s	  health	  indicators	  are	  on	  par	  with	  OECD	  nations:	  
Life	  expectancy	  in	  Taiwan	  is	  72	  for	  men	  and	  78	  for	  women,	  and	  infant	  mortality	  is	  6.14	  per	  
1,000	  live	  births.	  Taiwan’s	  health	  care	  infrastructure	  is	  also	  comparable	  to	  those	  of	  many	  
OECD	   countries,	   with	   5.7	   hospital	   beds	   and	   8.7	   medical	   professionals	   per	   1,000	   (Lu	   and	  
Hsiao,	   2003).	   By	   2007,	   total	   health	   expenditures	   represented	   6.3%	   of	   Taiwan’s	   GDP,	   of	  
which	  21%	  consisted	  of	  prescription	  drug	  expenditures.	  
       Taiwan’s	  health	  care	  system,	  modeled	  after	  Canada,	  is	  publicly	  financed	  with	  patients	  
free	   to	   choose	   among	   a	   mixture	   of	   private	   and	   public	   medical	   care	   providers.	   Taiwan’s	  
National	   Health	   Insurance	   has	   achieved	   universal	   enrollment	   for	   a	   comprehensive	   package	  
of	  medical	  services.	  Virtually	  all	  health	  care	  providers	  are	  under	  contract	  with	  the	  National	  
Health	   Insurance	   Bureau	   (NHIB),	   which	   pays	   physicians	   fee-­‐for-­‐service	   for	   consultations,	  
diagnostic	  tests	  performed	  in	  the	  office,	  and	  writing	  drug	  prescriptions	  (Cheng,	  2003).	  	  
        Prior	   to	   1997,	   physicians	   were	   also	   allowed	   to	   dispense	   drugs	   directly	   out	   of	   their	  
offices	  (Wagstaff,	  2007).	  NHIB	  paid	  physicians	  for	  dispensing	  drugs	  based	  on	  a	  set	  of	  fixed	  
formulary	   fees.	   Physicians,	   however,	   were	   able	   to	   procure	   the	   drugs	   directly	   from	  
manufacturers	  at	  a	  much	  lower	  cost	  than	  the	  NHI	  formulary	  prices	  (Eggleston,	  2009).	  As	  a	  
result,	  physicians	  reaped	  handsome	  profits	  from	  the	  sale	  of	  drugs.	  	  
        In	   1997,	   facing	   rapidly	   rising	   prescription	   drug	   expenditures,	   Taiwan	   instituted	   an	  
anti-­‐self-­‐referrals	  policy	  called	  the	  “separating”	  policy,	  designed	  to	  disentangle	  physicians’	  
diagnosis	  and	  treatment	  decisions	  from	  the	  financial	  incentive	  to	  prescribe	  drugs	  (Chou	  et	  
al.,	   2003).	   The	   “separating”	   policy	   prohibited	   clinics	   from	   dispensing	   drugs	   directly	   by	  
physicians	  from	  their	  offices	  and	  physicians	  from	  owning	  offsite	  pharmacies.	  	  
        There	  were	  a	  number	  of	  exceptions.	  First,	  like	  the	  Stark	  Law’s	  safe	  harbor	  exception,	  
physician	  clinics	  that	  have	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  with	  a	  licensed	  pharmacist,	  dedicated	  space	  
with	   adequate	   storage,	   refrigeration	   and	   record	   keeping	   were	   allowed	   to	   continue	   to	  
dispense	   drugs.	   Second,	   clinics	   without	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy	   were	   allowed	   to	   continue	   to	  
dispense	   drugs	   to	   children	   and	   the	   elderly	   for	   acute	   medical	   conditions	   for	   which	   quick	  
dispensing	  of	  drugs	  was	  deemed	  important.	  	  



                                                                            6
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	  


          The	  separating	  policy	  was	  rolled	  out	  across	  villages	  over	  the	  course	  of	  several	  years,	  
beginning	  in	  March	  1997.	  Before	  enforcing	  the	  policy	  in	  a	  village,	  the	  NHIB	  had	  to	  ascertain	  
that	   there	   were	   sufficient	   numbers	   of	   independent	   pharmacies	   where	   patients	   could	   fill	  
their	  prescriptions.	  Villages	  became	  subject	  to	  the	  policy	  as	  soon	  as	  the	  NHIB	  determined	  
there	   was	   at	   least	   1	   independent	   pharmacy	   for	   every	   500	   residents.	   There	   was	   a	   sharp	  
increase	   in	   pharmacists	   following	   the	   implementation	   of	   the	   policy.	   Between	   1997	   and	  
2001	   the	   number	   of	   licensed	   pharmacists	   grew	   from	   23,892	   t	   over	   40,000,	   and	   pharmacist	  
monthly	  salaries	  jumped	  dramatically	  from	  an	  average	  of	  US$	  625	  to	  US$	  1870.	  
          There	  was	  concern	  that	  physicians	  tried	  to	  get	  around	  the	  separating	  policy	  through	  
“gateway	  pharmacies,”	  which	  are	  legally	  independent	  pharmacies	  registered	  in	  the	  name	  of	  
the	   pharmacist	   but	   in	   reality	   owned	   by	   clinic	   physicians.	   Although	   the	   true	   status	   of	  
independent	  pharmacies	  is	  unobservable,	  Lee	  (2007)	  defined	  gateway	  pharmacies	  as	  those	  
for	  whom	  70%	  of	  their	  prescriptions	  came	  from	  a	  single	  physician	  group.	  He	  estimated	  that	  
only	  3.6%	  of	  clinics	  used	  gateway	  pharmacies	  in	  2000,	  the	  end	  of	  our	  study	  period.

                     Our	   data	   is	   a	   0.2%	   random	   sample	   of	   all	   ambulatory	   care	   claims	   from	   1997	   through	  
2000.5	  While	   the	   separating	   policy	   was	   implemented	   at	   the	   village	   level,	   the	   claims	   data	  
provide	   geographic	   identification	   at	   the	   township	   level;	   each	   township	   includes	   multiple	  
villages.	   We	   drop	   data	   from	   townships	   with	   mixed	   implementation	   dates,	   approximately	  
25%	   of	   the	   sample.	   While	   Townships	   are	   more	   aggregate	   than	   villages	   they	   are	  
substantially	  smaller	  than	  municipalities.	  Taiwan	  has	  24	  municipalities	  and	  194	  Townships.	  	  
          The	   unit	   of	   observation	   is	   the	   outpatient	   visit.	   	   Available	   information	   in	   the	   dataset	  
includes	   use	   of	   and	   expenditures	   for	   physician	   and	   complementary	   medical	   services	  
associated	   with	   those	   office	   visits,	   regardless	   of	   where	   those	   services	   were	   provided.In	  
Table	   1	   we	   provide	   baseline	   descriptive	   statistics	   disaggregated	   by	   a	   clinic’s	   integration	  
status	  at	  baseline	  –	  i.e.	  whether	  they	  had	  a	  pharmacy	  inside	  the	  clinic.	  At	  baseline,	  prior	  to	  
the	   separating	   policy,	   35%	   of	   clinics	   had	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy	   (Table	   1,	   Panel	   B).	   Consistent

 	  We	  limit	  our	  study	  to	  the	  period	  ending	  on	  December	  31,	  2000	  as	  the	  separating	  policy	  was	  implemented	  in	  
most	  of	  Taiwan	  by	  the	  end	  of	  2000	  and	  the	  NHIB	  changed	  physician	  payment	  from	  fee	  for	  service	  to	  Global	  
Budgets	  in	  2001.	  


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              7
                                                                                                                                                             	  


with	   our	   conceptual	   framework,	   the	   integrated	   clinics	   were	   substantially	   larger	   than	   the	  
non-­‐integrated	   clinics	   in	   terms	   scale	   (visits	   and	   revenues).	   While	   integrated	   clinics	   are	  
larger	  than	  non-­‐integrated	  clinics,	  there	  are	  no	  real	  differences	  in	  the	  types	  of	  patients	  that	  
they	  attract	  or	  in	  they	  way	  in	  which	  they	  treat	  those	  patients.	  	  	  

5. Policy	  Impact	  

         In	   this	   section	   we	   estimate	   the	   reduced-­‐form	   impact	   of	   the	   separating	   policy	   on	  
clinics	   that	   did	   not	   have	   a	   pharmacy	   onsite	   at	   baseline.	   The	   effect	   is	   reduced	   form	   in	   the	  
sense	   that	   it	   is	   an	   average	   of	   the	   effects	   for	   clinics	   subject	   to	   the	   policy	   at	   baseline	  
regardless	  of	  their	  decision	  to	  integrate	  in	  reaction	  to	  the	  policy.	  	  

      5.1.              	  Event	  History	  Analysis	  

          Figures	   1	   and	   2	   plot	   the	   share	   of	   visits	   that	   receive	   drug	   prescriptions	   and	   the	  
average	   drug	   expenditure	   per	   visit	   conditional	   on	   positive	   expenditures	   over	   time	   for	   3	  
groups:	  (1)	  clinics	  that	  never	  had	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  (never)	  and	  therefore	  were	  subject	  to	  
the	  separating	  policy,	  (2)	  those	  that	  did	  not	  have	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  prior	  to	  the	  policy	  but	  
added	  one	  post	  policy	  (switchers)	  and	  thus	  became	  exempt	  form	  the	  policy,	  and	  (3)	  those	  
that	   had	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy	   prior	   to	   the	   implementation	   of	   the	   policy	   (always)	   and	  
therefore	  were	  always	  exempt	  from	  the	  policy.	  The	  horizontal	  axis	  is	  centered	  at	  time	  zero,	  
which	   is	   the	   month	   in	   which	   the	   separating	   policy	   became	   effective	   in	   the	   township	   in	  
which	   the	   clinic	   is	   located.	   Observations	   to	   the	   right	   of	   zero	   refer	   to	   months	   post	  
implementation,	  and	  observations	  to	  the	  left	  refer	  to	  months	  prior	  to	  implementation.	  	  
          Prior	   to	   the	   implementation	   of	   the	   separating	   policy,	   the	   levels	   and	   trends	   of	   drug	  
prescriptions	   are	   similar	   for	   all	   3	   types	   of	   clinics.	   However,	   after	   implementation,	   drug	  
prescriptions	   fell	   in	   the	   never	   clinics	   who	   were	   subject	   to	   the	   policy.	   On	   the	   other	   hand,	  
drug	   prescriptions	   in	   the	   always	   and	   switcher	   clinics	   who	   were	   exempt	   from	   the	   policy	  
continued	  on	  trend	  after	  the	  implementation	  of	  the	  policy.	  

      5.2. Identification	  Strategy	  

         We	  use	  a	  difference-­‐in-­‐differences	  approach	  that	  compares	  the	  change	  in	  outcomes	  in	  
the	  treatment	  group	  to	  the	  change	  in	  outcomes	  in	  a	  comparison	  group.	  The	  change	  in	  the	  


                                                                                   8
                                                                                                                                                                 	  


comparison	   group	   is	   an	   estimate	   of	   the	   true	   counterfactual	   –	   that	   is,	   what	   would	   have	  
happened	  to	  the	  treatment	  group	  if	  there	  were	  no	  intervention.	  The	  strategy	  controls	  for	  
time-­‐invariant	  characteristics	  at	  the	  physician	  level	  as	  well	  as	  time-­‐varying	  factors	  common	  
to	   both	   comparison	   and	   treatment	   physicians	   at	   the	   local	   municipality	   level,	   and	   for	  
heterogeneity	  in	  patient	  demographic	  and	  epidemiological	  case-­‐mix.	  	  
       Our	  comparison	  group	  is	  the	  set	  of	  clinics	  that	  had	  onsite	  pharmacies	  at	  baseline	  and	  
therefore	   were	   not	   subject	   to	   the	   separating	   policy.	   The	   advantage	   of	   this	   comparison	  
group	   is	   that	   they	   are	   located	   in	   the	   same	   municipalities	   as	   the	   treatment	   group.	   This	  
allows	   us	   to	   control	   for	   time-­‐varying	   factors	   that	   may	   have	   been	   introduced	  
contemporaneously	   at	   the	   municipality	   level	   with	   the	   implementation	   of	   the	   policy,	   but	  
allows	   time-­‐varying	   shocks	   to	   have	   different	   impacts	   across	   municipalities.	   Examples	  
include	  new	  local	  health	  policies,	  differential	  economic	  growth,	  and	  differing	  changes	  in	  the	  
local	  epidemiological	  environment.	  	  
          We	  estimate	  the	  following	  specification:	  

                                  𝑦!"#$% = 𝛼! + 𝛾!" +                        ! 𝛿! 𝑥!"   + 𝛽 1 − 𝐼!,!"# 𝑇!" + 𝜀!"#$%                                         (2)
where

            township	  k	  and	  municipality	  m	  in	  period	  t;	  	  
      •     αj	  is	  a	  fixed	  effect	  for	  physician	  j;	  	  
      •     γmt	  is	  a	  fixed	  effect	  for	  municipality	  m	  in	  time	  period	  t;

      •     Ij,pre	  =	  1	  if	  clinic	  j	  had	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  prior	  to	  the	  implementation	  of	  the	  policy;	  
      •     Tkt	  =	  1	  if	  the	  separating	  policy	  is	  in	  force	  in	  township	  k	  in	  period	  t;	  and	  
      •     εijkmt	  is	  a	  zero	  mean	  random	  error.	  	  
      The	  coefficient	  β	  is	  the	  difference-­‐in-­‐difference	  estimate	  of	  the	  impact	  of	  the	  policy	  on	  
drug	   expenditures	   and	   diagnostic	   expenditures.	   The	   physician	   fixed-­‐effects	   control	   for

      5.3.                                                                       	  Results	  	  

              The	   results,	   presented	   in	   Panel	   A	   of	   Table	   2,	   are	   consistent	   with	   our	   theoretical	  
predictions.	   The	   separating	   policy	   reduced	   the	   likelihood	   of	   prescription	   by	   1.4	   percentage	  
points	   and	   drug	   expenditures	   conditional	   on	   a	   prescription	   by	   3.8%.	   These	   translate	   into	   a	  
reduction	   in	   total	   drugs	   expenditures	   of	   5.2%	   among	   clinics	   that	   did	   not	   have	   an	   onsite	  
pharmacy	   at	   baseline.6	  	   Physicians	   did	   compensate	   by	   slightly	   increasing	   the	   share	   of	  
patients	  that	  had	  diagnostic	  tests	  but	  there	  was	  no	  effect	  on	  physician	  services.	  Overall,	  the	  
policy	  reduced	  total	  costs	  (drug	  plus	  diagnostic	  plus	  physician	  services)	  by	  1.3%	  in	  clinics	  
not	  integrated	  at	  baseline.	  However,	  the	  policy	  was	  binding	  only	  for	  clinics	  that	  did	  had	  an	  
onsite	  pharmacy,	  which	  at	  baseline	  treated	  40%	  of	  patients.	  Hence,	  the	  overall	  impact	  on	  
total	  drug	  expenditures	  was	  only	  1.7%	  and	  on	  total	  expenditures	  was	  a	  reduction	  of	  0.5%.	  
          Our	   results	   are	   substantially	   smaller	   than	   those	   of	   Chou	   et	   al	   (2003)	   who	   report	   a	  
16%	  reduction	  in	  the	  probability	  of	  prescription	  and	  a	  12%	  fall	  in	  drug	  costs	  conditional	  on	  
a	   prescription	   associated	   with	   the	   initial	   implementation	   of	   the	   separating	   policy.	   They	  
compared	  the	  average	  change	  in	  drug	  expenditures	  in	  two	  municipalities	  nine	  months	  after	  
the	  policy	  was	  implemented	  compared	  to	  the	  average	  change	  in	  two	  other	  cities	  that	  had	  
not	   yet	   implemented.	   Some	   of	   the	   reasons	   for	   these	   differences	   could	   due	   to:	   (1)	   we	  
examine	   the	   impact	   of	   the	   policy	   nationwide	   in	   all	   24	   municipalities	   and	   for	   a	   substantially	  
longer	  period	  (3	  years);	  (2)	  the	  short	  recall	  period	  in	  the	  Chou	  et	  al	  analysis	  may	  not	  have	  
long	   enough	   to	   fully	   capture	   the	   extent	   to	   which	   clinics	   integrated	   pharmacies	   onsite	   to	  
circumvent	  the	  policy,	  which	  would	  tend	  to	  lower	  the	  estimates;	  (3)	  we	  employ	  a	  visit	  level	  
analysis	   that	   additionally	   controls	   for	   physician	   fixed	   effects,	   patient	   and	   illness	  
characteristics,	  and	  time-­‐varying	  factors	  at	  the	  municipality	  level;	  and	  (4)	  we	  also	  confirm	  
the	  validity	  of	  our	  comparison	  groups	  using	  a	  number	  of	  robustness	  and	  specification	  tests.

                        5.4.1. Baseline	  Balance	  of	  Treatment	  and	  Comparison	  Groups	  

                 We	  first	  show	  that	  the	  treatment	  and	  comparison	  sample	  is	  balanced	  in	  1997	  prior	  to	  
the	   implementation	   of	   the	   policy.	   	   This	   rules	   out	   Ashefelter	   dip	   type	   explanations	   for	  
treatment	   effects	   in	   the	   difference	   in	   difference	   estimates.	   Panel	   A	   in	   Table	   1	   compares	   the	  
means	   of	   patient	   characteristics	   and	   treatment	   patterns	   of	   the	   treatment	   clinics	   (Not	  
Integrated)	   and	   comparison	   clinics	   (Integrated).	   	   Both	   treatment	   and	   comparison	   clinics	  
attracted	   the	   same	   type	   of	   patients	   and	   provided	   those	   patterns	   with	   the	   same	   type	   of	   care	  
in	   terms	   of	   drug	   prescriptions	   and	   diagnostic	   tests.	   There	   are	   no	   statistically	   significant	  
differences	  in	  the	  means	  of	  12	  out	  of	  the	  13	  patient	  level	  variables	  in	  Table	  1.	  Specifically,	  
we	   find	   no	   differences	   in	   patient	   sex	   and	   or	   in	   medical	   reason	   for	   the	   visit.	   Slightly	   over	  
40%	  of	  their	  office	  visits	  to	  both	  types	  of	  clinics	  are	  for	  a	  respiratory	  infection.	  Physicians	  
in	  both	  types	  of	  clinics	  preform	  diagnostics	  test	  on	  about	  3%	  of	  patients	  and	  spent	  about	  
the	   same	   amount	   on	   those	   tests.	   Physicians	   in	   both	   types	   of	   clinics	   also	   prescribed	  
medications	  to	  almost	  all	  patients,	  prescribed	  identical	  classes	  of	  medications	  (primarily	  of	  
antacids,	   anti-­‐inflammatory	   agents,	   antihistamines,	   and	   other	   palliative	   medications	  
associated	  with	  the	  common	  cold	  or	  upper	  respiratory	  infections),	  and	  prescribed	  the	  same	  
amount	   in	   terms	   of	   expenditures	   on	   drugs.	   The	   one	   difference	   in	   that	   slightly	   younger	  
patients	  seem	  to	  visit	  integrated	  clinics.7	  	  

                        5.4.2. Pre-­‐intervention	  Trends	  	  

                 The	   key	   assumption	   underlying	   the	   causal	   interpretation	   in	   our	   difference	   in	  
differences	  model	  is	  that	  the	  change	  in	  the	  comparison	  group	  is	  an	  unbiased	  estimate	  of	  the	  
counterfactual	  –	  i.e.	  what	  would	  have	  been	  the	  change	  in	  the	  treatment	  group	  without	  the	  
separating	   policy.	   While	   we	   cannot	   directly	   test	   this	   assumption,	   we	   did	   employ	   the	  
Heckman-­‐Hotz	   test	   that	   asks	   whether	   the	   pre-­‐intervention	   trends	   of	   the	   treatment	   group	  
are	   different	   from	   those	   of	   the	   comparison	   group.	   If	   the	   pre-­‐intervention	   trends	   are	   not	  
different,	   there	   would	   be	   no	   reason	   to	   assume	   that	   they	   would	   be	   different	   in	   the	   post	  
period	  without	  the	  intervention.

    	  Recall	  that	  we	  explicitly	  control	  for	  patient	  age	  along	  with	  gender	  and	  illness	  diagnosis	  in	  the	  models.	  


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 11
                                                                                                                                                                                   	  


           We	   implement	   the	   test	   by	   dropping	   all	   post-­‐policy	   observations	   from	   our	   sample,	  
and	  running	  the	  following	  model:	  

                          𝑦!"#$% = 𝛼! + 𝛾!" +                   ! 𝛿! 𝑥!"      +   ! 𝜆!     1 − 𝐼!,!"# 𝑙! 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑! + 𝜀!"#$% 	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  (3)

where	  lm	  =	  1	  if	  the	  clinic	  is	  located	  in	  municipality	  m,	  Trendt	  is	  a	  continuous	  time	  variable	  
indicating	  quarter,	  and	  all	  other	  variables	  are	  as	  defined	  for	  equation	  (2).	  	  
            The	  coefficients	  of	  interest	  are	  the	   λm’s	  on	  the	  interaction	  terms	  of	  the	  municipality	  
dummies,	   future	   treatment	   dummies	   and	   the	   time	   trend.	   Note	   that	   we	   test	   if	   the	   pre-­‐
intervention	   trends	   are	   equal	   for	   each	   municipality	   separately	   and	   jointly.	   If	   these	   are	  
jointly	  zero,	  then	  we	  reject	  the	  hypothesis	  that	  the	  pre-­‐intervention	  trends	  are	  different	  for	  
the	  treatment	  and	  comparison	  groups.	  	                 	  
	          We	   estimate	   equation	   (3)	   for	   each	   of	   the	   dependent	   variables.	  Almost	   all	  of	   the	   λm’s	  
(84	  out	  90)	  are	  not	  significantly	  different	  that	  zero	  and	  the	  F-­‐statistics	  for	  the	  hypothesis	  
that	   all	   of	   the	   coefficient	   interaction	   terms	   are	   jointly	   for	   each	   outcome	   zero	   cannot	   be	  
rejected	   at	   conventional	   significance	   levels	   for	   each	   of	   the	   five	   dependent	   variables	  
(Appendix	  Table	  A1).	  

       5.5. 	  	  Robustness	  Tests	  

            5.5.1. Alternative	  Identification	  Strategy	  

        Another	  source	  of	  variation	  that	  can	  be	  used	  to	  identify	   causal	  impacts	  comes	  from	  the	  
fact	   that	   the	   policy	   was	   phased	   in	   geographically	   over	   time.	   In	   this	   case	   the	   treatment	  
group	  consists	  of	  clinics	  located	  in	  the	  municipalities	  that	  were	  early	  adopters	  of	  the	  policy	  
and	   the	   comparison	   group	   consist	   of	   those	   located	   in	   late	   adopter	   counties.	   In	   this	   case	   the	  
treatment	  group	  consists	  of	  clinics	  located	  in	  the	  townships	  that	  were	  early	  adopters	  of	  the	  
policy	  and	  the	  comparison	  group	  consist	  of	  those	  located	  in	  late	  adopter	  townships.	  	  
        However,	  this	  strategy	  has	  two	  limitations.	  First,	  it	  can	  only	  controls	  for	  time	  varying	  
shocks	   that	   are	   common	   across	   all	   treatment	   and	   comparison	   areas,	   but	   not	   for	   time	  
varying	   shocks	   that	   idiosyncratically	   vary	   across	   townships.	   This	   approach	   also	   has	   a	  
smaller	  sample	  as	  it	  uses	  only	  the	  clinics	  that	  did	  not	  have	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  at	  baseline.	  
        The	  specification	  is	  identical	  to	  equation	  (2),	  except	  that	  the	  time	  fixed-­‐effects	  do	  not	  
varying	   by	   municipality.	   We	   find	   that	   point	   estimates,	   presented	   in	   Table	   2	   Panel	   B,	   are	  


                                                                                  12
                                                                                                                                                           	  


very	   close	   to	   the	   main	   regression	   results	   in	   Panel	   A	   and	   most	   are	   statistically	   significant.	  
However,	   some	   of	   the	   estimates	   are	   somewhat	   less	   precise	   due	   to	   substantially	   smaller	  
sample	  sizes	  and	  more	  limited	  variation	  for	  identification.	  

           5.5.2. Placebo	  Test	  

       	   The	   fact	   that	   there	   are	   no	   differences	   in	   the	   pre-­‐intervention	   trends	   is	   consistent	  
with	   the	   identifying	   assumptions	   that	   the	   change	   in	   the	   control	   group	   is	   a	   consistent	  
estimate	   of	   the	   counterfactual.	   However,	   we	   still	   cannot	   completely	   rule	   out	   that	   the	  
remote	   possibility	   that	   post	   trends	   may	   have	   diverged	   within	   municipalities	   due	   to	   some	  
unobservable	   post	   policy	   time-­‐varying	   factors.	   	   We	   use	   a	   placebo	   test	   to	   rule	   out	   this	  
possibility.	   Specifically,	   we	   estimate	   the	   reduced	   form	   specified	   in	   equation	   (2)	   on	   the	  
sample	   of	   visits	   to	   clinics	   by	   patients	   who	   are	   exempt	   from	   the	   separating	   policy	   i.e.	   the	  
young	   and	   the	   elderly.	   Since	   they	   are	   exempt,	   the	   introduction	   of	   the	   separating	   policy	  
should	  have	  no	  effect	  on	  drug	  and	  diagnostic	  expenditures	  for	  these	  patients.	  The	  results	  
are	  presented	  in	  Panel	  C	  of	  Table	  2	  and	  show	  no	  effect	  of	  the	  separating	  policy.	  

           5.5.3. Patient	  Sorting	  

       	   An	  alternative	  explanation	  of	  the	  results	  could	  be	  patient	  sorting	  in	  response	  to	  the	  
policy,	   i.e.	   patients	   who	   had	   strong	   preferences	   for	   drugs	   or	   the	   convenience	   of	  filling	   their	  
prescriptions	  onsite	  switched	  to	  control	  facilities	  as	  a	  result	  of	  the	  policy.	  	  To	  address	  this	  
possibility,	  we	  examined	  patient	  clinic	  switching	  behavior	  using	  a	  panel	  data	  set	  of	  200,000	  
individuals.	   Of	   those,	   155,343	   sought	   care	   at	   a	   clinic	   at	   least	   once	   between	   January	   1,	   1997	  
and	  December	  31,	  2000.	  On	  average,	  patients	  sought	  care	  six	  times	  per	  year.	  Of	  those	  that	  
patronized	   clinics	   without	   a	   pharmacy	   at	   baseline,	   only	   347	   (0.2%)	   switched	   to	   visit	   a	  
different	  clinic	  with	  a	  pharmacy	  after	  the	  policy	  was	  implemented	  in	  their	  township.	  	  

6. Moral	  Hazard	  

          The	  moral	  hazard	  effect	  is	  the	  extra	  drug	  expenditures	  resulting	  from	  the	  incentive	  
to	  prescribe	  more	  drugs	  from	  physician	  ownership	  of	  pharmacies.	  	  The	  moral	  hazard	  effect	  
is	   simply	   the	   difference	   in	   drug	   expenditures	   with	   and	   without	   pharmacy	   ownership.	  We	  
identify	   this	   by	   estimating	   the	   effect	   of	   the	   separating	   on	   physician	   treatment	   decisions	  


                                                                                13
                                                                                                                                                               	  


with	  and	  without	  onsite	  pharmacies.	  This	  requires	  us	  to	  estimate	  the	  effect	  of	  the	  policy	  on	  
physician	  behavior	  explicitly	  taking	  into	  account	  the	  decision	  to	  integrate	  pharmacies.	  	  

      6.1. 	  Integration	  

            A	  substantial	  number	  of	  clinics	  not	  integrated	  at	  baseline	  (38%)	  chose	  to	  integrate	  
after	  the	  policy	  was	  implemented	  and	  the	  that	  integrated	  on	  average	  had	  68%	  more	  patient	  
visits	  than	  those	  that	  did	  not.	  Figure	  3	  displays	  integration	  overtime	  separately	  for	  clinics	  
in	   different	   parts	   of	   the	   baseline	   distribution	   of	   patient	   volume.	   The	   probability	   of	  
integration	   is	   effectively	   zero	   up	   until	   the	   separating	   policy	   becomes	   effective	   and	   then	  
increases	   dramatically	   shortly	   thereafter	   with	   substantially	   larger	   increases	   for	   the	  
medium-­‐	  and	  large-­‐volume	  clinics.	  
            These	   graphical	   results	   are	   confirmed	   in	   a	   difference-­‐in-­‐difference	   analysis	   of	   the	  
impact	  of	  the	  policy	  on	  the	  integration.	  We	  estimate	  a	  clinic	  level	  version	  of	  equation	  (2)	  for	  
integration	   using	   the	   sample	   of	   clinics	   that	   were	   not	   integrated	   at	   baseline.	   Model	   (1)	  
confirms	  that	  66%	  of	  clinics	  choice	  to	  integrate.	  Model	  (2)	  adds	  interactions	  of	  treatment	  
with	   the	   baseline	   quartile	   of	   the	   distribution	   of	   number	   of	   visits.	   The	   results	   show	   that	  
clinics	  that	  had	  larger	  volumes	  of	  patients	  at	  baseline	  were	  more	  likely	  to	  integrate.	  

      6.2. Identification	  Strategy	  

          We	   employ	   a	   triple	   differences	   strategy	   that	   assumes	   that	   the	   decision	   to	   integrate	  
was	   based	   on	   fixed	   characteristics.	   Specifically,	   we	   compare	   the	   difference-­‐in-­‐difference	  
estimate	   of	   the	   impact	   of	   the	   policy	   on	   clinics	   that	   did	   not	   integrate	   to	   the	   difference-­‐in-­‐
difference	   estimate	   of	   the	   impact	   on	   clinics	   that	   did	   integrate.	   The	   first	   double	   difference	  
compares	   the	   change	   in	   outcomes	   of	   those	   that	   did	   not	   integrate	   to	   those	   that	   were	  
integrated	  at	  baseline	  and	  the	  second	  double	  difference	  compares	  the	  change	  in	  those	  that	  
did	  integrate	  to	  those	  that	  were	  integrated	  at	  baseline.	  	  	  
          The	   assumption	   that	   the	   decision	   to	   integrate	   is	   based	   on	   time-­‐invariant	  
characteristics	   is	   consistent	   with	   the	   fact	   the	   almost	   all	   clinics	   that	   integrated	   did	   so	  
immediately	   after	   the	   policy	   is	   implemented	   in	   their	   township	   (Figure	   3).	   	   Moreover,	   while

by	   theory,	   there	   are	   no	   baseline	   differences	   in	   the	   types	   of	   patients	   treated	   or	   in	   the

                     The	   moral	   hazard	   effect	   is	   calculated	   from	   β,	   which	   is	   the	   effect	   of	   the	   policy	   on

      6.3. Results	  

              The	   results	   are	   presented	   in	   panel	   A	   of	   Table	   5.	   We	   find	   that	   the	   separating	   policy	  
reduced	   the	   probability	   that	   a	   physician	   working	   in	   a	   non-­‐integrated	   clinic	   gave	   a	   drug	  
prescription	   by	   2.1	   percentage	   points	   and	   average	   drug	   expenditures	   conditional	   on	   a	  
prescription	  by	  4.9%.	  Hence,	  the	  separating	  policy	  reduced	  drug	  expenditure	  fell	  by	  7.1%	  
for	   this	   group.8	  We	   also	   find	   that	   these	   physicians	   slightly	   increased	   diagnostic	   tests.	  
Overall,	  the	  separating	  policy	  reduced	  total	  outpatient	  expenditures	  by	  1.8%.	  As	  expected,	  
however,	   the	   separating	   policy	   had	   no	   effect	   on	   physicians	   who	   worked	   in	   clinics	   that	  
integrated	  and,	  as	  a	  result,	  were	  exempt	  from	  the	  separating	  policy	  -­‐-­‐	  Row	  (a)	  +	  (b).	  
              Our	   results	   imply	   that	   the	   moral	   hazard	   cost	   of	   physicians	   owning	   pharmacies	   is	  
non-­‐trivial.	   At	   baseline,	   mean	   drugs	   expenditures	   at	   baseline	   were	   NT$88.91	  for	  the	  group	  
of	   clinics	   that	   did	   not	   integrate.	   A	   7.1%	   reduction	   caused	   by	   the	   separating	   policy	   that	  
eliminated	   the	   incentives	   from	   physician	   ownership	   means	   that	   costs	   were	   reduced	   by	  
NT$6.31	  to	  NT$82.67,	  which	  can	  be	  interpreted	  as	  the	  “appropriate”	  amount	  of	  drugs	  for	  
the	  treatment	  of	  the	  patient.	  Moral	  hazard	  increased	  expenditures	  by	  NT$6.01	  or	  7.6%.

      6.4. 	  Control	  Group	  Validity	  

            6.4.1. Baseline	  Balance	  

      Despite	   that	   fact	   that	   larger	   clinics	   chose	   to	   integrate,	   there	   was	   no	   difference	   in	   the	  
types	   patients	   nor	   in	   the	   treatment	   patterns	   between	   clinics	   that	   chose	   to	   integrate	   and	  
those	   that	   did	   not	   (Table	   3,	   Panel	   A).	   This	   rules	   out	   Ashenfelter	   dip	   explanations	   of	   the	  
results.	  Specifically,	  we	  find	  no	  differences	  in	  patient	  sex	  and	  or	  in	  medical	  reason	  for	  the	  
visit.	   Physicians	   in	   both	   types	   of	   clinics	   preform	   diagnostics	   test	   on	   about	   3%	   of	   patients	  
and	   spent	   about	   the	   same	   amount	   on	   those	   tests.	   Physicians	   in	   both	   types	   of	   clinics	   also	  
prescribed	  medications	  to	  almost	  all	  patients,	  prescribed	  identical	  classes	  of	  medications,	  
and	  prescribed	  the	  same	  amount	  in	  terms	  of	  expenditures	  on	  drugs.	  The	  one	  difference	  is	  
that	  patients	  who	  visited	  integrated	  clinics	  were	  younger	  and	  we	  explicitly	  control	  for	  this	  
in	  all	  models.	  

            6.4.2. Pre-­‐intervention	  Trends	  Tests	  

          The	   key	   assumptions	   underlying	   the	   causal	   interpretation	   in	   our	   triple	   differences	  
model	   are	   that	   the	   change	   in	   the	   group	   integrated	   at	   baseline	   is	   an	   unbiased	   estimate	   of	  
what	   would	   have	   been	   the	   change	   in	   the	   group	   not	   integrated	   at	   baseline	   that	   choose	   to	  
integrate	  and	  an	  unbiased	  estimate	  of	  the	  group	  that	  choose	  not	  to	  integrate.	  Again,	  while	  
we	   cannot	   test	   this	   directly,	   we	   can	   employ	   The	   Heckman-­‐Hotz	   tests	   of	   pre-­‐intervention	  
trends.	  We	  have	  already	  shown	  the	  there	  is	  no	  difference	  in	  the	  pre-­‐intervention	  trends	  of	  
the	  groups	  that	  were	  and	  were	  not	  integrated	  at	  baseline.	  In	  this	  section,	  we	  test	  equality	  of	  
the	  pre-­‐intervention	  trends	  of	  the	  groups	  that	  were	  not	  integrated	  at	  baseline	  that	  choose	  
to	  integrate	  and	  that	  choose	  not	  to	  integrate.	  
          We	  implement	  the	  test	  by	  dropping	  all	  post-­‐policy	  observations	  from	  our	  sample	  and	  
estimate	  the	  following	  model	  for	  the	  group	  of	  clinics	  that	  were	  not	  integrated	  a	  baseline:	  

                               	  𝑦!"#$ = 𝛼! + 𝛾!" +              ! 𝛿! 𝑥!"#$   +      ! 𝜆! 𝐼!"      ! 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑!       + 𝜀!"#$ 	             	            (5)	  
                                  	  
where	   Ijk	   is	   a	   dummy	   variable	   indicating	   whether	   physician	   j	  in	   municipality	   k	  will	   be	   in	   an	  
integrated	  group	  in	  the	  post	  period,	  Trendt	  is	  a	  continuous	  time	  variable	  indicating	  quarter,	  
and	  all	  variables	  are	  as	  defined	  for	  equation	  (3).	  The	  coefficients	  of	  interest	  are	  the	   λk’s	  on	  
the	  interaction	  of	  the	  municipality	  dummies,	  integration	  dummy	  and	  time	  trend.	                                    	  


                                                                                 16
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	  


	                  We	  estimate	  equation	  (5)	  for	  each	  of	  the	  dependent	  variables.	  Almost	  all	  of	  the	   λk’	  
(78	  out	  80)	  are	  not	  significantly	  different	  that	  zero.	  The	  hypothesis	  that	  all	  of	  the	  coefficient	  
interaction	   terms	   are	   jointly	   for	   each	   outcome	   zero	   also	   cannot	   be	   rejected	   at	   conventional	  
significance	  levels	  for	  4	  out	  of	  the	  5	  dependent	  variables	  (Appendix	  Table	  A2).	  

       6.5. Placebo	  Test	  

                    We	  also	  estimate	  the	  triple	  differences	  model	  in	  equation	  (4)	  on	  the	  sample	  of	  visits	  
to	   clinics	   by	   patients	   who	   are	   exempt	   from	   the	   separating	   policy	   i.e.	   the	   young	   and	   the	  
elderly.	   Since	   they	   are	   exempt,	   the	   introduction	   of	   the	   separating	   policy	   should	   have	   no	  
effect	  on	  drug	  and	  diagnostic	  expenditures	  for	  these	  patients.	  The	  results	  are	  presented	  in	  
Panel	  C	  of	  Table	  5	  and	  show	  little	  or	  no	  effect	  of	  the	  separating	  policy.	  

       6.6. An	  Alternative	  Identification	  Strategy	  	  

             As a robustness test we also estimate the triple differences model by using instrumental
variables to control for the possibility that the integration decision was in part in response to
time-varying shocks to specific clinics within municipalities. Our instrument is baseline practice
volume interacted with the timing of the introduction of the separating policy in the clinic as
an instrument for integration.9 The instrument is the empirical analogue of the volume variable
in the theoretical model interacted with whether the policy is active.

                    6.6.1. Instrument	  Validity	  

             We have already shown that the instrument is a highly significant predictor of the
probability that the clinic integrates. It is also highly correlated with the outcomes of interest.
Figures 4 and 5 plot the share of visits receiving a prescription and the average drug expenditures
per visit over time separately by four baseline practice volume quartiles. Drug prescriptions rise
the most post-policy for the smallest group and do not rise for the largest groups.
             One potential concern with this instrument, however, is the larger clinics attract different
types of patients and are able to treat those patients with different (better) procedures. However,

         	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
9
 	  Specifically, we re-estimate the triple difference model in equation (4) by instrumental variables. We instrument
for treatment times pharmacy with D40 (=1 if the baseline practice volume exceeds 40,000 visits per year) and (1-D40)
× log baseline volume, both interacted with a dummy indicating that the separating policy was active in which the
clinic was located.	  


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             17
                                                                                                                                                         	  


baseline clinic volume also does not seem to be correlated with the baseline type of patients,
types of illnesses treated or provider treatment patterns as there is no difference in these variables
between clinics that choose to integrate and those who did not (Table 3 Panel A). Hence it is
unlikely that baseline volume is an independent cause of the outcomes of interest.

           6.6.2. IV	  Triple	  Difference	  Results	  

          The results are presented in panel B of Table 5. The estimate of moral hazard in row (a) is
almost identical to that which we found using the simple triple difference strategy. Specifically,
the separating policy reduced the probability that a physician working in a non-integrated clinic
gave a patient drug prescription by 2.7 percentage points and reduced average drug expenditures
per visit by 4.9 percent. This reduced total drug expenditures by 7.7%. We also find almost
identical effects on diagnostic test expenditures as well and overall total expenditures.
          In contrast to the triple differences results, we do find that integration, row (a) + (b),
increased total expenditures by 2.3% primarily through increased drug expenditures. One reason
may be that clinics without a pharmacy are not able to dispense certain types of drugs and must
refer to an independent pharmacy. By integrating an onsite pharmacist into their practices, they
are now able to dispense these types of drugs and hence can exploit this fact for further gain.

7. Economies	  of	  Scope	  

          In	  this	  section	  we	  examine	  potential	  gains	  from	  integration	  resulting	  from	  economies	  
of	   scope	   that	   may	   improve	   quality	   of	   care.	   There	   are	   two	   possible	   routes	   to	   improved	   care.	  
First,	   integration	   could	   improve	   therapy	   adherence,	   i.e.	   patients	   following	   drug	  
prescription	   regimes	   have	   lower	   costs	   of	   filling	   and	   refilling	   prescriptions	   when	  
pharmacies	   are	   located	   in	   the	   physician’s	   office	   and	   therefore	   have	   better	   adherence	   to	  
their	  prescribed	  medication	  regimes.	  	  Second,	  integration	  may	  improve	  the	  coordination	  of	  
care	   through	   better	   communication	   between	   physicians	   and	   pharmacists	   at	   the	  
prescription	  phase	  resulting	  in	  improved	  treatment	  plans.	  	  

     7.1. Therapy	  Adherence	  

          We	   examine	   medication	   adherence	   for	   two	   chronic	   diseases	   –	   diabetes	   and	  
hypertension.	   Medication	   adherence	   is	   particularly	   important	   for	   both	   type	   of	   patients	  



                                                                               18
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	  


Persistent	   high	   levels	   of	   blood	   sugar	   can	   have	   immediate	   short-­‐term	   effects	   that	   require	  
some	  form	  of	  emergency	  treatment	  and	  blood	  pressure	  can	  spike	  even	  after	  a	  two-­‐day	  drug	  
holiday	   from	   medication	   (Ribeiro	   et	   al.	   2007).	   	   High	   levels	   of	   medication	   adherence	   are	  
associated	  with	  lower	  hospitalization	  rates	  for	  both	  types	  (Sokol	  et	  al.,	  2005).	  	  	  
              We	   measure	   therapy	   adherence	   by	   the	   extent	   to	   which	   patients	   with	   chronic	  
diseases	  fill	  their	  drug	  prescriptions	  on	  time.	  The	  hypothesis	  is	  that	  patients	  are	  more	  likely	  
to	   fill	   drug	   prescriptions	   if	   they	   are	   able	   to	   do	   so	   in	   the	   clinic	   at	   the	   time	   of	   prescription	  
rather	   than	   having	   to	   fill	   them	   later	   at	   a	   pharmacy	   outside	   of	   the	   clinic.	   The	   adherence	  
measure	   is	   the	   share	   of	   days	   per	   quarter	   that	   the	   patient	   has	   medication	   in	   her	   possession,	  
a	  common	  measure	  of	  adherence	  in	  the	  medical	  literature	  (Osterberg	  and	  Blascke	  2005).	  
              We	   test	   for	   economies	   of	   scope	   in	   therapy	   compliance	   using	   the	   triple	   differences	  
model.	  If	  integration	  improves	  adherence	  then	  the	  effect	  of	  the	  policy	  on	  clinics	  that	  did	  not	  
integrate	  should	  be	  negative	  and	  there	  should	  be	  no	  effect	  of	  the	  policy	  on	  clinics	  that	  did	  
integrate.	   We	   find	   no	   effects	   on	   therapy	   adherence	   for	   both	   diabetic	   and	   chronically	   ill	  
hypertensive	  patients	  (Table	  6).	  	  

      7.2. 	  	  Adverse	  Events	  

              We	   examine	   adverse	   events	   from	   deficient	   medical	   treatment	   measured	   by	   an	  
avoidable	   ER	   visit	   or	   hospitalization	   shortly	   after	   the	   outpatient	   visits	   to	   clinic.10 	  We	  
consider	   adverse	   events	   for	   three	   types	   of	   prevalent	   patient	   diagnoses:	   acute	   respiratory	  
infections	   (ARI),	   diabetes,	   and	   hypertension	   –	   the	   most	   prevalent	   chronic	   diseases	   in	   the	  
majority	   of	   industrialized	   economies.	   These	   diseases	   are	   ambulatory	   care	   sensitive	  
conditions	   for	   which	   good	   primary	   care	   and	   drug	   adherence	   can	   drastically	   reduce	   or	   even	  
eliminate	   the	   need	   for	   hospitalizations	   or	   ER	   visits.	   Moreover,	   any	   clinically	   significant	  
interruption	  in	  treatment	  of	  diabetes	  and	  hypertension	  is	  likely	  to	  manifest	  as	  an	  adverse	  
event	   in	   a	   relatively	   short	   time-­‐horizon	   (Ho	   et	   al.,	   2006,	   Sokol	   et	   al.,	   2005,	   Wu	   et	   al.,	   2009).	  	  
When	   ARI	   is	   not	   treated,	   it	   can	   manifest	   itself	   into	   more	   serious	   problems	   such	   as	  
pneumonia	  that	  could	  require	  hospitalization.	  

          	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
10
  	  These	  avoidable	  adverse	  events	  are	  typically	  caused	  by	  deficient	  medical	  treatment.	  See,	  for	  example,	  
DiMatteo	  et	  al.	  (2002),	  Lee	  et	  al,	  (2006),	  Mojtabai	  and	  Olfson	  (2003),	  Osterberg	  and	  Blaschke	  (2005),	  Simpson	  
et	  al.	  (2006),	  and	  Tabor	  and	  Lopez	  (2004).	  


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              19
                                                                                                                                                         	  


          For	   ARI,	   we	   examine	   ER	   utilization	   and	   inpatient	   admissions	   within	   30	   days	   of	   the	  
office	   visit.	   For	   diabetic	   and	   hypertensive	   patients,	   we	   examine	   ER	   utilization	   and	  
hospitalization	   rates	   within	   360	   days	   of	   the	   visit	   as	   medical	   issues	   associated	   with	  
uncontrolled	  diabetes	  or	  hypertension	  can	  take	  time	  to	  develop.	  	  The	  results,	  reported	  in	  
Table	  7,	  show	  no	  significant	  effects	  on	  either	  adverse	  event	  measure	  for	  any	  of	  the	  diseases.	  	  

8. Conclusions	  

         A	   concern	   of	   anyone	   who	   consults	   a	   doctor,	   plumber,	   or	   auto	   mechanic	   is	   the	  
incentive	  to	  give	  advice	  that	  is	  not	  in	  the	  buyer's	  best	  interests.	  Nowhere	  is	  this	  truer	  than	  
when	  physicians	  have	  an	  ownership	  interest	  in	  complementary	  medical	  services,	  and	  is	  the	  
reason	   that	   led	   to	   the	   Stark	   Law	   that	   prohibits	   referrals	   of	   Medicare	   and	   Medicaid	   patients	  
to	  complementary	  care	  facilities	  in	  which	  the	  physicians	  have	  a	  financial	  interest.	  	  
         In	  this	  paper,	  we	  investigated	  a	  Stark-­‐like	  policy	  in	  Taiwan	  that	  prohibited	  physicians	  
from	   owning	   pharmacies	   and	   dispensing	   drugs	   unless	   they	   had	   an	   onsite	   pharmacy.	   We	  
find	   that	   the	   policy	   reduced	   drug	   expenditures	   among	   physicians	   that	   did	   not	   have	   an	  
onsite	   pharmacy.	   However,	   the	   overall	   effectiveness	   of	   the	   policy	   in	   reducing	   costs	   was	  
mitigated	  by	  increased	  overprovision	  of	  diagnostic	  services	  not	  covered	  by	  the	  policy,	  and	  
many	  of	  clinics	  that	  did	  not	  have	  an	  onsite	  pharmacy	  prior	  to	  the	  policy	  integrated	  onsite	  
pharmacies	  into	  their	  practices	  to	  become	  exempt	  from	  policy.	  In	  the	  end,	  the	  policy	  only	  
applied	  to	  less	  than	  40%	  of	  clinics.	  As	  a	  result,	  the	  separating	  policy	  only	  reduced	  aggregate	  
outpatient	  expenditures	  by	  less	  than	  1	  percent.	  	  
         Despite	   this	   policymakers	   are	   correct	   to	   be	   concerned	   about	   physicians	   referring	  
patients	   to	   an	   entity	   in	   which	   they	   have	   a	   financial	   interest	   because	   of	   the	   potential	   for	  
overtreatment.	  Our	  results	  do	  show	  that	  moral	  hazard	  costs	  of	  self-­‐referral	  incentives	  are	  
significant.	  Physicians	  that	  own	  pharmacies	  prescribe	  7.6%	  more	  drugs	  to	  outpatients	  than	  
physicians	  that	  do	  own	  pharmacies.	  	  	  
         The	  bright-­‐line	  of	  the	  safe	  harbor	  exception	  appears	  to	  be	  misguided	  as	  appear	  to	  be	  
no	  evidence	  economies	  of	  scope	  efficiency	  justifications	  from	  the	  integration	  of	  pharmacies	  
into	  physician	  practices.	  Specifically,	  we	  do	  not	  find	  that	  the	  convenience	  of	  collecting	  one’s	  
prescriptions	   before	   leaving	   the	   physician	   office	   improves	   adherence	   to	   drug	   therapy	  
among	  diabetic	  and	  chronically	  ill	  hypertensive	  patients.	  	  Nor	  do	  we	  find	  that	  integration	  


                                                                               20
                                                                                                                                                	  


improves	   coordination	   of	   care	   enough	   to	   reduce	   adverse	   events	   for	   patients	   with	   diabetes,	  
hypertension	  or	  ARI.	  
         Providing	   safe	   harbor	   exceptions	   ultimately	   voids	   the	   very	   purpose	   of	   the	   original	  
prohibition	   as	   physicians	   exploit	   these	   loopholes	   to	   continue	   to	   engage	   in	   profitable	   self-­‐
referrals.	   	   The	   “safe	   harbor”	   exemption	   only	   encourages	   physicians	   to	   integrate	  
complementary	   into	   their	   practices	   thereby	   increasing	   costs	   from	   moral	   hazard	   without	  
any	  off	  setting	  gains	  in	  efficiency	  from	  economies	  of	  scope.
