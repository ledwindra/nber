MODELING STRUCTURAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION
IN THE MARKET'S VALUATION OF BANKING FIRMS

ABSTRACT

This paper decomposes both the market sensitivity and the interest-rate

sensitivity of bank stock into on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet
components. It derives these constituent and often-offsetting sensitivities

from a nonstationary three-equation model that employs accounting and
capital-market information to explain cross-sectional and temporal variation
in the value of stockholder equity.

To control statistically for heteroskedasticity

and

intrasample

differences in unbooked capital positions, the model is estimated separately

for three size classes of large U.S. banks. Parameter estimates confirm the
importance of "hidden" or unbooked capital at these banks. For the nation's

very largest banks, shifts in the value of these parameters are consistent

with the view that the capitalized value of federal deposit-insurance
guarantees burgeoned in the l980s with interest volatility, demonstrations
of regulatory forbearance, and relaxation of deposit-rate ceilings.

MODELING STRUCTURAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION

IN THE MARKET'S VALUATION OF BANKING FIRMS

I.

Introduction

This paper seeks to enrich the profession's interpretation of the
market

and

interest-rate

sensitivity

of deposit-institution stock.

Economists conventionally assess these sensitivities as the regression
coefficients fitted to market returns and interest rates in an expanded
market model. A market model uses capital-market data to estimate a usually

stationary stochastic process presumed to generate periodic returns to
stockholders. A stationary and nonstructural model seems poorly suited to
analyzing a period when macroeconomic conditions, policy rules, financial

technology, and regulatory freedoms change rapidly. We derive market and
interest-rate sensitivities from a nonstacionary model that uses accounting
and capital-market information to explain the value of stockholder equity.

Our analysis develops two distinctions that partition the market value

of a firm's stock (i.e. ,

its

market capitalization, MV) into three

components. The first distinction decomposes MV into hidden and recorded
capital reserves. The second distinction decomposes hidden capital reserves

into values that are "unbooked but bookable" on a historical-cost basis
under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and those which are
currently treated as unbookable off-balance-sheet items under GAAP.
Our statistical model develops explicit estimates of both components of

hidden capital. We estimate the net unbooked value of bookable (or onbalance-sheet) positions by estimating an intermediate valuation ratio, k.

This variable expresses the ratio of the market to book value of the
collected components of a firm's bookable equity, Be• Applying the valuation

2

ratio to By, the value of accounting or book net worth, assigns a market
value to bookable assets and liabilities. Subtracting this estimate of

from market capitalization values off-balance-sheet items. This appraised
value of unbookable equity, tJe captures the net value of unbookable

assets

and liabilities.

We develop estimates of k and

for 43 quarters of 1975-85. We do this

by regressing cross-sectionally the market value of banks' equity shares on

the book value of their accounting net worth. We call this

regression

equation, the Statistical Market Value Accounting Model, SMVAM. We link this
model to the market model by endogenizing changes in k and

as functions

of cx post returns on stocks and bonds.

We envisage the parameters of these second-stage models

as undergoing

evolutionary change during 1975-85. Goldfeld and Quandt's [(1972), (1973),

(1976)] switching regression method, GQSRN, is used to study the temporal
variability of model parameters. CQSRM estimates three attributes of regime

variation: specific shift dates, the gradualness of each

shift, and the

parameters of the stochastic process governing each regime.
Expanded market models make no direct use of accounting information

on

the bookable positions of a firm and make no effort to separate bookable and
unbookable items. Rapid expansion in banks' fee-based service

activity and

in the policy problems that off-balance-sheet activities pose for deposit
insurers (Kane, 1985) should create a demand for market-based

measures of

off-balance-sheet activities.

We interpret our model as a flexible functional form that

incorporates

structural detail aggregated away in a market model. It uses accounting data

to focus structurally on market participants' ex ante and nonstationary

valuation dectsions rather than forcing ex post returns to fit a stationary
process. Our analysis endogenizes temporal movements in the degree of market

and interest sensitivity of capital positions that develop on and off a
bank's conventional balance sheet. Specifying and estimating this additional
structure

generates

evidence of disaggregated market and interest

sensitivity that cannot be observed by directly fitting a two-index model of
ex post equity returns. This additional evidence reconciles some conflicting
findings in market-model studies of market and interest sensitivity.
II. The Statistical Market-Value Accounting Model

If markets are efficient, financial analysts see through smoke and

mirrors raised by contemporary accounting rules. Our analysis develops
separate estimates for bookable and unbookable elements of the market and
interest sensitivity of a depository firm's generalized balance sheet.

At any time, a firm's market capitalization, MV, is the product of its

share price and number of shares outstanding. Invoking the principle of
value additivity, MV may also be expressed as the market value of bookable

and unbookable assets, (A +A'), minus the market value of bookable and

mm

unbookable nonequity liabilities,

(Lm+L)•

because

deposit- insurance

subsidies are widely believed to have surged during the 1980s and to vary
with bank size, it is instructive to isolate from other unbookable assets

the value of a deposit institution's explicit and conjectural federal

.,

guarantees net of discounted future costs, FCG (cf. Benston
Brickley and James, 1986; and Thomson, 1987). In symbols,

4

Since recorded assets and liabilities are carried at historical cost, even

(Am_Lm) cannot be observed directly. A parsimonious way to proceed is to
assume that market participants estimate the market value of elements of
bookable equity by applying appropriate mark-up or mark-down ratios, ka and

to the accounting values reported by the institution. Adopting this
approximationtransforms equation (1) to:

MV —

[Fcc

+ (A' —

L')]

+

kAb

—

klLb,

(2)

where subscripts a, 1, and b represent assets, liabilities, and booked
values, respectively.

In principle, A.0 and L.0 are jointly determined variables, affected by
many of the same unknown exogenous variables. Treating A.0 and Lb as separate

and exogenous regressors could introduce interpretive problems. Fortunately,

our data give no evidence of these problems. At every date for every bank
class, the coefficient constraint that ka —

k1 proves impossible to reject.

This justifies our applying a single valuation ratio k to the value of an
institution's book equity, By —

Ab

—

Lb.

Expressing the market value of unbookable equity ((Fcc+A_L)] as Ue
and allowing for approximation error introduced in the model, we obtain
equation (3):

MV—U +k3V+e .

(3)

We term this equation, which can be estimated from time-series or crosssectional data sets, the Statistical Market-Value Accounting Model, SMVAM.

As with many statistical models employed in finance, equation (3) can

be justified most satisfactorily as a "flexible functional form." The

virtues

specifications's

lie

in having a small number of readily

interpretable parameters and in incorporating several testable restrictions.

Our specification treats e as an approximation error. Our goal is to show

that (3) can be imbedded into a specification that uses more information

than a market model, not that (3) completely represents the process
determining MV.

Parameter Restrictions

In applying the model cross-sectionally, we restrict the valuation
ratio ki applicable to bank i at time t to have the same value k across
each bank class. To lessen damage from this restriction, it is necessary to
focus on relatively homogeneous subsamples of banks.

A set of what should be seen as identifying restrictions follow from
reformulating (3) as a two-equation model of Ueand Be:

Ue —au +bU BV+e 1
Be —

a

e

+ b

e

BV + e

(4)

2

With only one instrumental variable, four coefficients cannot be identified.

Equation (3) overcomes this problem by restricting b and ae each to zero.

To the extent that either U is not uncorrelated with book value or ae
e

is

nonzero, the neglected coefficients bleed into our estimates of k and
Although such bleeding limits our capacity to separate the components of
hidden reserves, it does not invalidate (3) considered as a reduced form.

A third restriction is that (3) and (4) are linear. However, using a
linear approximation to what is presumed to be a monotonically increasing
function is less damaging when the range of upside and downside variation is

controlled by outside forces. On the upside, takeover discipline limits

6

large holdings of capital because high levels of capital reduce deposit-

insurance subsidies. On the downside, the FDIC introduces increasing
regulatory penalties whenever a bank's BV heads toward zero (Buser, Chen,
and Kane, 1981). (Because the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation

has in recent years virtually abandoned capital discipline, the model might
work less well for S&Ls.)

A fourth restriction lies in treating BVi as exogenous. Because GAAP
gives bank managers options to realize unbooked gains and losses on bookable

and unbookable positions and authorities penalize low BV, ki and

and

tradable elements of Ue and BVi may be negatively correlated. Our estimated
rank orderings of k against bank size class vary over time.
Inter'retabi1ity Issues
The model's coefficients describe the

facto deceptiveness of GAAP.

Unless both U—O and k—l, the accounting or book value of a bank's capital
represents a biased estimate of the market value of stockholder equity. If

the estimated intercept is significantly positive (negative),unbookable
assets and liabilities serve as a net source of (drain on) institutional
capital. Financial analysts know that problems exist in both directions. On

the drain side, U.S. institutions habitually overstate

the

capital

contribution derived from their loan-loss reserves by not deducting an
allowance for anticipated loses that they have not yet formally realized. On

the sources side, institutions do not book the value of the depositinsurance guarantees they receive.

If only intercept bias were to exist, changes in accounting values

7

would be unbiased estimates of changes in the market value of on-balance-

sheet assets and liabilities. However, a slope bias may also exist. We
interpret (1-k) as a premium when k>l and as a discount factor when k<l.

Sampling Issues

It is difficult to develop a representative sample of data from which
to estimate SMVAM. Stock in few U.S. deposit institutions trades directly or

regularly in the market. Many thrift institutions are still

mutual

organizations, while small stockholder institutions are often privately
held. For large institutions, to exploit regulatory and tax benefits, stock

is typically owned indirectly through a holding company, HC. A bank (or a

saving and loan) MC may own more than one depository and may own
nondepository assets as well.

This leads us to reinterpret Ue For an HC, Ue may capture activity
that is on the HG's balance sheet but not on the balance sheet of the HC's

principal bank. We view estimates of SMVAM parameters as if equity in a
bank's affiliates were an off-balance-sheet position of the bank. We do this

because data on subsidiaries are not available quarterly and to link the
model with regulatory conceptions of affiliate activity.

Even if the market value of other HG subsidiaries and the unbookable
equity of the bank were uncorrelated with the bank's book equity, the mean
value of equity in HG affiliates would bleed into the measure of the bank's
unbookable equity provided by the intercept term. The size of this intercept
reflects the mean importance of all unbooked sources of value not correlated

with By.

Similarly, (l-R2) tells us how much variation in these items is

orthogonal to variation in BV.

a

If

subsidiary values and unbookable equity correlate with book equity,

regression estimates of the valuation ratio would be biased. Under these asyet unknowable circumstances, deviations of k from unity could signal either

the existence of capital gains and losses on bookable positions or sizebased variation in the value of affiliate equity and unbookable positions.
III. Buildjn Market and Interest-Rate Sensitivity into the SMVAM
The

parameters of the SMVAN are Ue and k. When stock and bond returns

change, these parameters must respond. To express the market and interestrate sensitivity of a deposit institution's bookable and unbookable equity,
we imbed this response in a triangular three-equation model.

This model portrays quarterly adjustments in each SMVAM parameter as a
linear function of market returns and interest rates:
(5)

Uet_ Ue,tl_ U + mt + Rt + Vt,

kr— k1 —

k + mt + pkR + w .

(6)

and R represent a market return and an interest-rate proxy and the
stochastic terms in each equation are conceived as approximation errors. The

slope coefficients

and

in (6) and

and

in (7) measure the market

sensitivity and interest-rate sensitivity of SMVAM's parameters.

As is equation (3), equations (5) and (6) are offered as flexible
functional forms. This two-equation submodel

is

intended

only

to

parameterize in an interpretable and parsimonious way revaluation decisions
that take place continually. The true models that (5) and (6)

two-index model

-

- merely

-

- and

the

approximate may be nonlinear in Rm and R and may

9

include unspecified other variables as well. Because our equations are
conceived as approximations, we subject parameter estimates to Goldfeld-

Quandt tests for regime shifts. Especially in an era of rapid financial
change, we think it important to allow the parameters of such approximations
to be recalibrated whenever statistical evidence indicates that movements in

omitted variables (such as authorities' closure rules) or nonlinearities
might have degraded a previously relevant model's explanatory power.

Equations (5) and (6) have the same logical standing as the following
two-index market model, which expresses the return on asset p as:

p

..p0

mm

+p+ .
r

p

(7)

In (7), the betas measure the asset's systematic market and interest-rate

sensitivity and

is a stochastic disturbance. Except that

may be

interpreted as an "industry factor" (Lee and Brewer, 1985; Sweeney and
Warga, 1987), the market model ignores the structural characteristics of
individual institutions and the markets in which they operate. One source
opines that "studies of bank stocks describe the pricing of steel industry
stocks as well as they do the pricing of bank stocks" (Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, 1986, p. 58).

Our equations condition market participants' revaluation decisions on
the same variables that are taken as exogenous in the two-index model. In a

reduced-form sense, then, (5) and (6) must explain the overall market

sensitivity, ,

and

the interest sensitivity, r' of equity returns in

model (7). These market-model betas may be deemed to be monotonically
increasing in the respective slopes of (5) and (6):

interest

volatility

and with the balance-sheet structure of sample

institutions.

IV. Data Set Used

End-of-quarter share prices, number of shares, and book values for a
set of large commercial banks are obtained from BANK COMPUSTAT, 1986. This
data set includes about 150 NYSE. AMEX and over-the-counter issues. Market

values are determined as the product of end-of-quarter share price and
number of shares outstanding. BANK COMPUSTAT provides data on the book
values of the principal bank subsidiary, defined as the total equity of the
common stockholders in the capital of the bank which includes the par value
of common stock, surplus, undivided profits, reserves for contingencies and
other capital reserves.

Our market proxy is the CRSP equal-weighted NYSE and AMEX monthly stock

index adjusted for dividends. Because empirical research shows no reliable
role for short-term rates in the two-index model (Kane and Unal, 1987), the

interest-rate index used is the monthly holding-period return on long-term
government bonds constructed by Ibbotson Associates, 1986. Monthly returns
are compounded to produce quarterly returns.

We interpret movements in holding-period yields as dominated by what
rational-expectations models term "interest-rate surprises." Although the

11

construction of holding-period returns parallels the CRSP proxy, such
returns reverse the economic interpretation of the sign of an interest-rate
coefficient.

Bond-price reductions induced by interest-rate increases

decrease holding-period returns. Hence, a rise in. holding-period returns
corresponds to a fall in interest rates, an event widely believed to benefit
the stock of a typical bank.

V. Parameter Estimates for SMVAM

Estimation proceeds stepwise. From a time series of cross-sectional

values for the MV and BV of individual banks, Ue and k are estimated by
ordinary least squares for each of 43 1975-1985 quarters. Then, to estimate

(5) and (6),

the quarterly changes in k and Ue are regressed on stock and

bond returns.

To

control

differences in k and

statistically for heteroskedasticity and intrasample

we classify sample banks into three asset-size

classes. For each class, the SMVA1( is estimated separately. The three size
groups consist of the largest 25 banks, the smallest 25 sample banks, and 54

to 97 other banks that we term medium-size banks. Banks of similar size may

be presumed to operate in broadly similar ways and to be disciplined or
assisted by deposit-insurance authorities in similar fashion.

For SMVAM, Table 1 reports quarterly cross-sectional regressions for

each size class. For the largest banks, t-tests reject (albeit with low
power) the combined U—O and k—i condition necessary for recorded equity to
be an unbiased estimate of market value except in nine quarters (for medium-

size banks, eighteen quarters). Accounting representations of the economic
performance of major banks are deceptive. Moreover, our data indicate that

12

the larger a bank becomes, the less reliably book values track the market
value of underlying stockholder claims.

It is also useful to examine the two prongs of the unbiasedness
condition separately. Deviations of

from zero show a definite time

pattern. Before 1980, the market value of unbookable equity is negative for

every bank group in every quarter. This means that off-balance-sheet items
serve as a drain on capital values before 1980. At the largest banks, this
drain

remains

statistically significant until mid-1979, but becomes

insignificant thereafter. A broadly similar pattern holds for the other two
bank groups: Uc remains negative throughout 1975-79, while its sign becomes
less regular during 1980-85.

The ratio of mean 13e to mean MV varies sharply between the 1975-79 and

1980-85 subperiods. During the first subperiod, this ratio is -31 percent

for the largest banks, -15 percent for medium banks and -25 percent for
small banks. During the 1980-85 period, the ratio shrinks dramatically,
becoming -l percent for the largest and smallest banks, and -9 percent for
medium-size banks. After 1980, unbookable equity seldom acts as significant

reservoir of hidden losses. This observation is consistent with the

hypothesis that after 1980, the value of

federal

deposit-insurance

guarantees increased with: interest volatility; demonstrations of regulatory

forbearance for large banks; and the relaxation of deposit-rate ceilings
(Kane, 1985). Of course, the precise effect of these forces at an individual

bank should vary with the bank's leverage and other portfolio riskiness.
Largest banks' dramatic improvement in the U./MV ratio may reflect different

economic forces from those operative at other banks. The upward surge of Ue

13

at very large institutions may be driven by administrative and political

difficulties that persuade regulatory authorities to overlook a capital
deficiency (caused, for example, by unrealized losses on LDC loans) and to
regard these institutions as "too big to fail" (Seidman, 1986).

For other

banks, the major influences may be the opening up of extralocal sources of

retail deposits and a broader range of potential acquirers, acquisitions,
and future activities.

Turning to k, the largest banks usually show a significant premium
(k>l) for recorded equity before 1980. However, k drops significantly below

unity in 1980 and in most quarters thereafter. For other size classes,
patterns

differ.

At

medium-size

banks,

except for two scattered

observations, k stays below one until 1983. From then on, k lies above unity

most of the time. The smallest banks' pattern resembles that of medium-size

banks, but the turn comes later, in 84/4 when the departure from unity
becomes significant.

VI. Digression on Switching Regression

We investigate the temporal variability of the parameters of the
second-stage equations (5) and (6) by Goldfeld and Quandt's switching
regression method (CQSRN). This section illustrates the method for an nregime specification of equation (5):

nonabruptness of the associated structural change.

Maximizing the likelihood functions developed in this paper requires

numerical optimization. GRADX (an algorithm using the quadratic hillclimbing method) in Princeton University's CQOPT package is used.
VII. Changes in the Market and Interest-Rate Sensitivity of k and Ue

Substantive interest focuses on the market sensitivity
interest-rate sensitivity (fl and

and

and residual variance (a and c7)

of unbookable equity and the valuation ratio. Tables 2 to 5 summarize CQSRM

results. Table 6 sorts out the individual significance of the many
individual coefficient shifts allowed.

Table 2 reports two regimes for the market and interest sensitivity of

unbookable equity for the largest and the smallest 25 banks. Medium-size
banks experience three regimes. In all three size classes, the market and

interest sensitivities of the valuation ratio show the same number of
regimes (although not always the same shift dates) as unbookable equity.

Table 3 reports the dates and gradualness of the shifts. Panel A
focuses on the market and interest sensitivity of unbookable equity. For the

largest banks, the only switch occurs at 78/3. This switch point estimate

has a standard error of 2.07 quarters. This means that the two-standarderror confidence interval for this switch date runs from roughly 77/3 to

16

79/3. The estimated associated gradualness parameter is 4.33 quarters
meaning the switch is gradual. Approximating the length of the transition by

twice the gradualness parameter implies this gradual switch (given an
estimated starting point) completes itself in nine quarters.

Medium and small banks' first switch is estimated at 77/2; medium
banks' second switch at 81/1. CQRSM cannot reject the hypotheses that these
switches are abrupt.
Panel

of Table 3 develops parallel results for the valuation ratio.

Large and small banks show one switch, while medium banks experience two.
The largest banks experience a gradual shift: the mean date is 77/3 and the

associated gradualness parameter is 3.47 quarters. The drift in the market

and interest sensitivity of the largest banks' valuation ratio takes 7
quarters. Medium banks' first and second switches occur abruptly at 77/2 and
80/4. Small banks' second regime starts at 77/1.

For all banks, GQRSM labels mid-1977 as a time of sea change. Around
this date, sample banks experience structural changes in their sensitivities

to stock returns and bond yields. This dating pattern supports the
political-economy view that the Fed's October 1979 change in operating
procedures is better conceived as an endogenous response to changes in the
economic and political environment affecting the stock of its client firms

rather than as an exogenous event. For the largest banks, the structural

drift tails off precisely when the Federal Reserve's regime change was
announced. Medium-size banks differ in experiencing a second structural
change at the end of 1980.

Table 4 reports sensitivities for unbookable equity in each regime. For

the largest banks, the market sensitivity of unbookable equity (fl) proves

17

negative and significant early in its 75/2-78/3 drift. But over time this

sensitivity becomes positive and loses its significance by 78/4. This
indicates that largest banks' off-balance-sheet positions hedge market
variation only during the 1975-78 period. After 1978, off-balance-sheet
positions lose their relation to market returns on stock. Table 6 confirms
that the shift in market beta is significant.

In both regimes largest banks' unbookable equity proves negatively
correlated with bond returns. This implies that the value of unbookable
equity at large banks increases when ex post bond returns fall (I.e., when
interest rates rise). This is consistent with Kane's (1985) hypothesis that

increases in FDIC guarantees offset much of interest-induced losses on net
bookable assets at banks the FDIC deems infeasible to liquidate. Although we
observe no significant shift between regimes, fl remains negative taken by
itself but loses significance during the second regime.

For medium banks, the market sensitivity of unbookable equity is
negative and significant in all three regimes. Compared to large banks,
medium-size banks' off-balance-sheet
variations

positions

better

hedge

market

after 77/3. Medium banks parallel large banks in having

unbookable equity relate negatively to holding-period yields prior to 1977.

However, the relation becomes insignificantly positive in the two regimes
operative after 77/3.

The specification for unbookable equity works poorly for the smallest
banks. R2 values prove much lower and slope coefficients are insignificant
in both regimes. This may trace to greater diversity in the way members of

this class operate or to the FDIC's willingness to enforce capital
requirements closely enough to keep the capitalized value of FDIC guarantees

18

close to zero for this size class. Table 6 clarifies that the 77/2 shift is
best viewed as a significant increase in residual variance.

Market and interest sensitivites for the valuation ratio are found in

Table 5.

For the largest banks,

is positive and significant in both

regimes. This positive sign indicates that when stock returns increase, so

does the valuation ratio for book equity. For fixed interest rates, this

means that in a bull market book values increasingly underestimate the
market

value of net bookable assets. The market and interest-rate

sensitivities of the valuation ratio for the largest banks decline after the

77/3 shift, but only the decline in market beta proves significant. During
both regimes, the relation between k and holding-period returns on bonds is

positive. This indicates that the institution's bookable assets are more
interest-sensitive than its bookable liabilities. This is not evidence that

the Macauley duration (as opposed to the "effective duration") of its
bookable assets exceeds the duration of its bookable liabilities. Such an

implication would hold only for infinitesimal movements in r (Kaufman,
1984). The robustness of the coefficient restraint kakl_k suggests instead
that interest-rate variation affects the repayment capacities of banks and
borrowers.

For medium banks, the valuation ratio also shows a consistently
positive market-sensitivity. During the first two regimes,

is unchanged,

while the increase observed after 1981 is insignificant. The valuation ratio

correlates positively with holding-period yields during each regime, but

after the first switch on 77/2, the coefficient shifts significantly

19

downward. In the last 7.5 years of the sample, the effective durations of
bookable assets and liabilities appear to be nearly matched.

For the smallest banks, the valuation-ratio model works only a little

better than the unbookable-equity model. Prior to the 76/4 switch, market
sensitivity is significant and positive. Once the switch occurs, the model

deteriorates, with no beta remaining significant. Once again, Table 6
portrays the shift as an increase in residual variance.
CpmDprison with Related Studies

Our

results

help to explain the diversity of interest-sensitivity

estimates reported in previous studies (Lloyd and Shick, 1977; Lynge and
Zuxnwalt, 1980; Chance and Lane, 1980; Flannery and James, 1984; Kane and
Unal, 1988). Market models estimated from CRSP and DRI data show bank equity

returns becoming interest-rate sensitive only after 1979. Prior to 1979,
market-model evidence indicates insensitivity to interest rates. Tables 4

and 5 show that, for all but the smallest banks in our sample, Ue is

negatively and k is positively correlated with cx post bond returns
prior to the first switch and that both coefficients ( and

are

significant. During the 1975-79 period, the impact of the separately
significant fl and

are therefore offsetting. The resulting "tendency to

cancel out" clarifies how researchers could estimate an insignificant
interest-rate beta

for the two-index model with data drawn from this

interval. For the largest and medium-size banks that the cited authors
studied, Uc loses its significant link to bond returns during 1979-85.
Deleting this offsetting force permits movements in r to be dominated by

20

movements in $.

Eliminating

this category of revaluation ought to increase

the significance of er'S in a two-index market model.

Even though both interest-sensitivity terms decline in magnitude during

the late 1970s, the overall interest sensitivity of bank stock need not

decline. A stock's overall interest

sensitivity

reflects

the

net

contribution of both interest-rate betas. For the largest and medium-size
banks, the interest-sensitivity of off-balance-sheet items not only declines
in magnitude but begins a drift to insignificance in 1977. Hence, one cannot
reject the hypothesis that once the shifts complete themselves, the interest

sensitivity of bank stock in these size classes depended entirely on the
interest sensitivity of the valuation ratio.

VIII. Diagnostic Regression Experiments

Table 7 reports a series of regressions that investigate for the SMVAM

how well our three-way size partition controls for heteroskedasticity and
intrasample differences in k and U. The first panel estimates k and Ue for

the country's nine largest banks. These money-center banks consist of
Citibank and the eight banks that Sinkey (1986, p. 249) reports that its
staff labels as close competitors. Without exception, estimates of k lie
above and estimates of U lie below parallel estimates for the 25 largest
banks reported in Table 1 (often substantially so). The magnitude of these
differences suggests that these giant banks deserve a class of their own and

leads us to ask whether the 16 other large banks might be reclassified into

the medium group. Moreover, the very high k values assigned money-center

banks in the early quarters of our sample are inconsistent with a zero

correlation at these dates between book value and unbookable equity (which
for these giant banks includes the value of numerous affiliates).

As an alternative to reclassification, the second panel of the table
examines what happens when for the largest 25 banks the flexible form (3) is
respecified as a quadratic equation:

MV—U +(k+k1BV)BV+eQ.

(14)

(14) models the valuation ratio k as a function of By. Table 7 tells us that

for large banks k generally increases with bank size; but after 1980 never
significantly so. Substantial bleeding of unbookable equity into k seems to

be limited primarily to money-center banks during 1975-79. Parallel but
unreported runs for medium and small banks reveal different patterns. Medium
banks generally show a negative k1; this coefficient proves significant twothirds of the time before 1980 but only one-third of the time thereafter. At
small banks, k1 varies in sign and is almost never significant.
The third panel of Table 7 estimates the SMVAI4 for the 25 largest banks

after deflating all variables in equation (3) by By. This deflation would
correct exactly for heterosked.asticity if e in (3) were to equal the product

of a random error eD and BV. In any case, the indicated transformation
reweights individual observations, raising the weight of observations drawn

from smaller members of the large-bank sample relative to money-center
banks. Before 1980, deflated estimates of

and k for large banks lie

closer to the undeflated estimates for medium than for large banks. From

1981 on, the deflated estimates for large banks look much like the
undeflated ones. This supports the view that before 1980 the SMVAM should be

estimated separately for money-center banks. Results from fitting the

22

deflated

model to money-center banks (not presented here) confirm this. In

the money-center subsample, pre-1980 estimates of k and Ue are broadly
similar to those of the undeflated model. The main difference is that three-

fourths of the Uc estimates become significant at 5 percent. Using this
information to interpret the third panel of Table 7 assures us that deflated

pre-1980 estimates of unbookable equity at the next 16-largest banks would

be positive, with valuation ratios much more like those shown for mediumsize banks in Table 1. Taken together, these sensitivity tests underscore
the value of undertaking pooling tests to partition sample banks optimally.

We also tested the unit constraint on the lagged coefficients for Ue

and k built into the first-difference specifications (5) and (6). To do
this, we ran unconstrained regressions of Uet and k on their respective
and R over the time span of each regime identified in

(t-l)—values,

Table 2. Only one of the 14 lagged coefficients differs significantly from
unity at 5 percent.

for Further Research

reconceptualization
for

future

established

research:

in this paper offers four

sequential

estimation,

model

respecification, sample selection, and data partition. Under the identifying
restrictions and recursive structure employed here, sequential estimators of

U, k and the various betas can be regarded as consistent instrumentalvariable or method-of-moment estimators (Kmenta, 1971, pp. 559-567; Newey,
1984). To the extent that the recursive model is only an approximation or Ue
and k are improperly identified, the estimates of k and Ue employed as input

23

into second-round regressions add a measurement error to the modelapproximation errors envisaged in (5) and (6). Although this complication
could be addressed by estimating k, 1e' and the betas simultaneously, this

would greatly expand the parameter space over which costly Goldfeld-Quandt

search routines would have to operate. In our judgment,a more promising
approach is to await the development of

attractive instrumental-variable

equations for the bookable and unbookable components of MV. Given a
specification with less-oppressive identifying restrictions than our own,
the GQRSM procedure could be adapted to explaining time-series observations
for individual banks.

Model respecifications ought to focus on the possibility of finding

omitted variables and the desirability of disaggregating accounting net
worth into detailed asset and liability components. In principle, one could

expand either stage of the model. Following the lead of arbitrage-pricing
theory, one could expand the set of macroeconomic risk factors employed as

regressors in the second-stage equations. In (3), one might also estimate
distinctive

valuation

ratios

for

different classes of assets and

liabilities. Our own preliminary attempts to make these extensions failed to
improve upon the specifications reported here. It is difficult to expand the

specification without developing a simultaneous-equations model of a bank's
asset and liability decisions. Because existing bank portfolio models treat
banks as enjoying monopoly power in at least some deposit and loan markets,

they are ill-suited to representing the operations of large banks in 1975-

1985. However, one might adapt Goldfeld's (1966) empirical model of bank
behavior to serve this end.

24

At least three sample-selection issues merit attention. First, this

study includes no observations on either mutual institutions or stock
savings-and-loan associations and savings banks. Second, introducing data on

the value of individual HCs' nonbank subsidiaries would sharpen the
interpretation of Ue Third, survivorship bias could be studied by applying

the model to a set of institutions that went out of business between 1975
and 1985.

Finally, repartitioning our data would let us reinterpret our quarterby-quarter models in at least two ways. One

is

to test and correct our

regressions for richer forms of heteroskedasticity. A second is to use
pooling tests for parameter variation to isolate the nature of meaningful

differences in bank behavior. The size breakdown we employ represents a

preliminary attempt at developing interpretable patterns of parameter
similarities and differences, in which the partition itself is not tested
for significance. Investigations aimed at finding optimal pooling procedures
would also track changes over time in the composition of relevant classes.
X. Summary

This paper combines accounting estimates of a bank's net worth with

capital-market information to estimate a well-interpreted flexible-form
model of the values of the firm's net bookable and unbookable assets. By
permitting regime changes in the valuation models that reset market values

each quarter, our methods provide new insight into changes in: (1) the
market and interest sensitivity of a bank's stock and (2) the impact of offbalance-sheet positions on bank stock prices.
Our results show that the interest and market sensitivities of bookable

and unbookable values often prove offsetting in sign. In particular, the

25

evolution of the value and sensitivity of hidden capital at the nation's
very largest banks after 1978 is consistent with the hypothesis (Kane, 1985)
that during this period increases in the unbookable value of FDIC guarantees

offset the bulk of market-induced and interest-induced losses on net
bookable assets.
