    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies the role of exit from a monetary union during a debt crisis. A monetary union, such as the European Monetary Union, needs to establish a procedure for exit as a tool to cope with debt default. The paper studies various forms of exit and argues that \"Euroization\" is both a credible and effective means of punishment for countries in default.\n\n",
