    "abstract": "\n\nThe credit rating industry has historically been dominated by just two agencies, Moody's and S&P, leading to longstanding legislative and regulatory calls for increased competition.  The material entry of a third rating agency (Fitch) to the competitive landscape offers a unique experiment to empirically examine how in fact increased competition affects the credit ratings market. Increased competition from Fitch coincides with lower quality ratings from the incumbents:  rating levels went up, the correlation between ratings and market-implied yields fell, and the ability of ratings to predict default deteriorated.  We offer several possible explanations for these findings that are linked to existing theories.\n\n",
