Agglomeration: A Dynamic Approach
Walker Hanlon and Antonio Miscio
NBER Working Paper No. 20728
December 2014
JEL No. N9,R11,R12
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the sources of agglomeration economies in cities. We begin by introducing a simple
dynamic spatial equilibrium model that incorporates spillovers within and across industries, as well
as city-size effects. The model generates a dynamic panel-data estimation equation. We implement
the approach using detailed new data describing the industry composition of 31 English cities from
1851-1911. We find that industries grow faster in cities where they have more local suppliers or other
occupationally-similar industries. Industries do not grow more rapidly in locations in which they are
already large, though there can be exceptions. Thus, dynamic agglomeration appears to be driven by
cross-industry effects. Once we control for these cross-industry agglomeration effects, we find a strong
negative relationship between city size and city-industry growth. This allows us to construct the first
estimate of the aggregate strength of the cross-industry agglomeration forces. Our results suggest a
lower bound estimate of the overall strength of agglomeration forces equivalent to a city-size divergence
rate of 2.1-3.3 % per decade.

Introduction

What are the key factors driving city growth over the long term? One of the leading
answers to this question, dating back to Marshall (1890), is that firms may benefit
from proximity to one another through agglomeration economies. While compelling,
this explanation raises further questions about the nature of these agglomeration
economies. Do firm primarily benefit from proximity to other firms in the same industry, or, as suggested by Jacobs (1969), is proximity to other related industries
more important? Or is overall city size the key factor in determining agglomeration
economies? How do these forces vary across industries? How do these benefits compare to the cost of proximity arising through congestion forces? How can we separate
all of these features from the fixed locational advantages of cities? These are important questions for our understanding of cities. Their answers also have implications
for the design of place-based policies, which can top $80 billion per year in the U.S.
and are also widely used in other countries.1
Not surprisingly, there is a large body of existing research exploring the nature of
agglomeration economies. This study draws on two important existing strands of this
literature.2 One approach uses long-differences in the growth of city-industries over
time and relates them to rough measures of initial conditions in a city, such as an
industry’s share of city employment or the Herfindahl index over major city-industries
(Glaeser et al. (1992), Henderson et al. (1995)). The main concern with this line of
research is that it ignores much of the richness and heterogeneity that are likely to
characterize agglomeration economies. A more recent approach allows for a richer set
of inter-industry relationships using connection matrices based on input-output flows,

The New York Times has constructed a database of incentives awarded by cities, counties and states to attract companies to locate in their area. The database is available at
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/01/us/government-incentives.html.
2
There are several other strands of the agglomeration literature which are less directly related to
this paper. One strand focuses on addressing identification issues by comparing outcomes in similar
locations, where some locations receive a plausibly exogenous shock to the level of local economic
activity (Greenstone et al. (2010), Kline & Moretti (2013), Hanlon (2014)). This approach has the
advantage of more cleanly identifying the causal impact of changes in local economic activity, but it
may also be less generalizable and more difficult to apply to policy analysis. Thus, we view this line
of work as complementary to the our approach. Other alternative approaches use individual-level
wage data (Glaeser & Mar (2001), Combes et al. (2008), Combes et al. (2011)) or firm-level data
(Dumais et al. (2002), Rosenthal & Strange (2003), Combes et al. (2012)) to investigate the effects
of city size. See Rosenthal & Strange (2004) and Combes & Gobillon (Forthcoming) for reviews of
this literature.

labor force similarity, or technology spillovers. These connections are then compared
to a cross-section of industry locations (Rosenthal & Strange (2001), Ellison et al.
(2010), Faggio et al. (2013)).3 A limitation of this type of static exercise is that it is
more difficult to control for locational fundamentals in cross-sectional regressions.
This study offers an alternative approach that builds on previous work, but
also seeks to address some of the remaining issues facing the literature. To begin, we ground our estimation strategy in a dynamic spatial equilibrium model of
city-industry growth. While simple, our model serves both to discipline our empirical exercise and to highlight potential concerns in the estimation of agglomeration
economies. The theory delivers a relationship between local employment growth in
industry i during a period and the local level of employment in all industries at the
beginning of the period, weighted by a vector of parameters representing the strength
of spillovers between industry pairs, the strength of spillovers across firms within
industry i, time-varying city effects, and shocks to industry growth at the national
level.
To implement this approach, we build a uniquely rich long-run dataset describing
the industrial composition of English cities over six decades. These new data, which
we digitized from original sources, cover 31 of the largest English cities (based on 1851
population) for the period 1851-1911. The data come from the Census of Population,
which was taken every decade. These data have two unique features. First, they come
from a full census, not a sample of the census, which is important in reducing error
when cutting the data by city and industry. Second, the 23 industry groups that we
use in the analysis cover nearly the entire private sector economy of each city. We
add to this four measures of inter-industry connections reflecting input and output
linkages and the demographic and occupational similarity of industry workforces.
Motivated by the theory, we offer a panel-data econometric approach to estimating
agglomeration economies that builds on previous work by Henderson (1997).4 The use
of panel data offers well-known advantages over the cross-sectional or long-difference
approaches used in most of the existing literature. Following Ellison et al. (2010), we
parameterize the pattern of connections between industries using the matrices of in3

These studies are part of a broader literature looking at the impact of inter-industry connections,
particularly through input-output linkages, that includes work by Amiti & Cameron (2007) and
Lopez & Sudekum (2009).

A similar approach is explored in Dumais et al. (1997). See also Combes (2000) and Dekle
(2002).

dustry connections that we have constructed. Also, to help strengthen identification,
we use an instrumental variable approach in which we interact lagged city-industry
employment with industry employment growth in all other cities to generate predicted
employment in industry j in a period.5 This predicted employment level is then used
as an instrument for actual employment in industry j which will be independent of
contemporaneous local shocks. Put another way, we take advantage of the national
industry growth rate to generate predicted industry employment levels within a city
that are plausibly exogenous to local spillovers in the current period.
One contribution of this paper is to estimate the importance of dynamic agglomoeration forces related to industry scale, cross-industry connections, and city-size in a
unified framework, while controlling for fixed city-industry factors and time-varying
industry-specific shocks. We find that (1) cross-industry effects are important, and
occur largely through the presence of local suppliers and occupationally similar labor
pools, (2) the net effect of within-industry agglomeration forces are generally negative,
with a small number of exceptions, and (3) city size has a clear negative relationship
to city growth. The presence of local buyers appears to have little positive influence
on city-industry growth. Our methodology also allows us to examine heterogeneity
in the extent to which industries produce and benefit from agglomeration forces.
We provide a variety of tests examining the robustness of these results. For example, we show that our results are not substantially changed if we drop particular cities
or particular industries. They are also robust to using an alternative set of matrices
measuring cross-industry connections as well as a more aggregated set of industry
definitions. In addition, we have constructed a new matrix of industry technology
similarity using patent data that can be used to investigate agglomeration forces operating through this channel. Including this technological similarity matrix does not
substantially impact our main results. We also show that incorporating cross-city
effects, such as market potential or cross-city industry spillovers has little impact on
our results. These cross-city factors appear to be relatively weak compared to the
within-city effects that we observe.
A second contribution of this paper is to produce an estimate of the aggregate
strength of the agglomeration forces captured by our measures. This is done by
comparing actual city growth in a decade to the estimated city-time fixed effect for
5

This approach is somewhat similar to the technique used in Bartik (1991).

that decade from a model that includes the cross-industry connection variables. The
wedge between actual city growth and the estimated fixed effect must be equal to the
total impact of the agglomeration force. These results suggest that the agglomeration
forces captured by our empirical model are equivalent to a decadal city-size divergence
rate of 2.1-3.3%. This is likely to be a lower bound estimate as it will not reflect any
agglomeration forces not captured by our measures of cross-industry connections. To
our knowledge this is the first paper to show how the aggregate strength of these
many cross-industry connections can be measured.
The next section presents our theoretical framework, while Section 3 describes
the data. The empirical approach is presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents
the main results, while Sections 6 and 7 investigate the robustness of our results to
using alternative connection matrices or to including of cross-city effects. Section 8
concludes.

Theory

In this section, we build a simple model of city growth incorporating localized spillovers
within and across industries and use it to derive our empirical specification. Authors
such as Combes & Gobillon (Forthcoming) have highlighted the need to ground empirical studies of agglomeration economies in theory.6 Grounding our analysis in
theory can help us interpret the results while also being transparent about potential
concerns. However, it is important to keep in mind that theories other than the one
offered here may also generate a similar empirical specification. Thus, our analysis
should not be interpreted as a test of the particular mechanisms described by the
theory.
The model is dynamic in discrete time. The dynamics of the model are driven by
spillovers within and across industries which depend on industry employment and a
matrix of parameters reflecting the extent to which any industry benefits from learning
6

In a recent handbook chapter on agglomeration economies, Combes & Gobillon (Forthcoming)
write (p. 87), “this strand of the literature is an interesting effort to identify the mechanisms underlying agglomeration economies...Ultimately though, it is very difficult to give a clear interpretation
of the results, and conclusions are mostly descriptive. This is due to the weak links between estimated specifications and theoretical models...the presence and channels of endogeneity are difficult
to assess, and it is hard to conclude that some instruments are valid, as estimated specifications
have usually not been derived from any precise theoretical framework.”

generated by employment in other industries (i.e., learning-by-doing spillovers). These
dynamic effects are external to firms, so they will not influence the static allocation
of economic activity across space that is obtained given a distribution of technology
levels. Thus, we can begin by solving the allocation of employment across space in
any particular period. We then consider how the allocation in one period affects the
evolution of technology and thus, the allocation of employment in the next period.
The benefit of such a simple dynamic system is that it allows the model to incorporate
a rich pattern of inter-industry connections.
The theory focuses on localized spillovers that affect industry technology and
thereby influence industry growth rates. In this respect it is related to the endogenous
growth literature, particularly Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988). This is obviously not
the only potential agglomeration force that may lie behind our results; alternative
models may yield an estimation equation that matches the one we apply. However,
because we are interested in dynamic agglomeration, focusing on technology growth
is the natural starting point.
To keep things simple, our baseline model omits some additional features, such as
capital and intermediate inputs, that one might want to consider. In Appendix A.1,
we describe a more complex model that incorporates these features and show that it
delivers essentially the same estimating equation. There are two important simplifying assumptions in our theory. First, as in most urban models, goods and services
are freely traded across locations. Second, the production function parameters do not
vary across industries. In Appendix A.1 we discuss the implications of altering these
assumptions.

2.1

Allocation within a static period

We begin by describing how the model allocates population and economic activity
across geographic space within a static period, taking technology levels as given. The
economy is composed of many cities indexed by c = {1, ...C} and many industries
indexed by i = {1, ...I}. Each industry produces one type of final good so final goods
are also indexed by i.
Individuals are identical and consume an index of final goods given by Dt . The
corresponding price index is Pt . These indices take a CES form,

where xi is the quantity of good i consumed, γit is a time-varying preference parameter
that determines the importance of the different final goods to consumers, pit is the
price of final good i, and σ is the (constant) elasticity of substitution between final
goods. It follows that the overall demand for any final good is,

Production is undertaken by many perfectly competitive firms in each industry,
indexed by f . Output by firm f in industry i is given by,

t,

(2)

where Aict is technology, Licf t is labor input, and Ricf t is another input which we
call resources. These resources play the role of locational fundamentals in our model.
Note that technology is not specific to any particular firm but that it is specific to
each industry-location. This represents the idea that within industry-locations, firms
are able to monitor and copy their competitors relatively easily, while information
flows more slowly across locations.
Labor can move costlessly across locations to achieve spatial equilibrium. This
is a standard assumption in urban economic models and one that seems reasonable
over the longer time horizons that we consider. The overall supply of labor to the
economy depends on an exogenous outside option wage w̄t that can be thought of as
the wage that must be offered to attract immigrants or workers from rural areas to
move to the cities. Thus, more successful cities, where technology grows more rapidly,
will experience greater population growth.
We also incorporate city-specific factors into our framework. Here we have in
mind city-wide congestion forces (e.g., housing prices), city-wide amenities, and the
quality of city institutions. We incorporate these features in a reduced-form way by
including a term λct > 0 that represents a location-specific factor that affects the

6

firm’s cost of employing labor. The effective wage rate paid by firms in location c is
then w̄t λct . In practice, this term will capture any fixed or time-varying city amenities
or disamenities that affect all industries in the city.
In contrast to labor, resources are fixed geographically. They are also industryP
specific, so that in equilibrium f Ricf t = R̄ic , where R̄ic is fixed for each industrylocation and does not vary across time, though the level of R̄ic does vary across
locations. This approach follows Jones (1975) and has recently been used to study
the regional effects of international trade by Kovak (2013) and Dix-Carneiro & Kovak
(2014). These fixed resources will be important for generating an initial distribution
of industries across cities in our model, and allowing multiple cities to compete in the
same industry in any period despite variation in technology levels across cities.

This expression tells us that employment in any industry i and location c will depend on technology in that industry-location, the fixed resource endowment for that
industry-location, factors that affect the industry in all locations (pit ), city-specific
factors (λct ), and factors that affect the economy as a whole (w̄t ).

can set Mt to zero and then solve for the equilibrium price levels in the economy.8
Alternatively, we can consider a (small) open economy case where prices are given
and solve for Mt . We are agnostic between these two approaches.

2.2

Dynamics: Technology growth over time

Technological progress in the model occurs through localized learning-by-doing spillovers
that are external to firms. One implication is that firms are not forward looking when
making their employment decisions within any particular period. Following the approach of Glaeser et al. (1992), we write the growth rate in technology as,
Aict+1
ln
Aict




= Sict + ict ,

(4)

where Sict represent the amount of spillovers available to a city-industry in a period.
Some of the factors that we might consider including in this term are:

Sict = f



within-industry spillovers, cross-industry spillovers,


national industry technology growth, city-level aggregate spillovers .
We can use Equation 4 to translate the growth in (unobservable) city-industry
technology into the growth of (observable) city-industry employment. We start with
Equation 3 for period t + 1, take logs, plug in Equation 4, and then plug in Equation
3 again (also in logs), to obtain,

8

To solve for the price levels in the closed economy case, we use the first order conditions from
the firm’s maximization problem and Equation 3 to obtain,

This equation tells us that in the closed-economy case, changes in the price level for goods produced
by industry i will depend on both shifts in the level of demand for goods produced by industry i
represented by γit , as well as changes in the overall level of technology in that industry (adjusted
for resource abundance), represented by the summation over Aict terms.

where eict = ict+1 − ict is the error term. Note that by taking a first difference
here, the locational fundamentals term R̄ic has dropped out. We are left with an
expression relating growth in a city-industry to spillovers, city-wide growth trends,
national industry growth, and an aggregate national wage term.
The last step we need is to place more structure on the spillovers term. Existing
empirical evidence provides little guidance on what form this function should take.
In the absence of empirical guidance, we choose a fairly simple approach in which
technology growth is a linear function of log employment, so that
Sict =

X

τki max(ln(Lkct ), 0) + ξit + ψct

(6)

k

where each τki ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter that determines the level of spillovers from industry k to industry i. While admittedly arbitrary, this functional form incorporates
a number of desirable features. If there is very little employment in industry k in
location c (Lkct ≤ 1), then industry k makes no contribution to technology growth
in industry i. Similarly, if τki = 0 then industry k makes no contribution to technology growth in industry i. The marginal benefit generated by an additional unit of
employment is also diminishing as employment rises. This functional form does rule
out complementarity between technological spillovers from different industries. While
such complementarities may exist, an exploration of these more complex interactions
is beyond the scope of the current paper.
One feature of Equation 4 is that it will exhibit scale effects. While this may be a
concern in other types of models, it is a desirable feature in a model of agglomeration
economies, where these positive scale effects will be balanced by offsetting congestion
forces, represented by the λct terms.
Plugging Equation 6 into Equation 5, we obtain our estimation equation:

This equation expresses the change in log employment in industry i and location c
in terms of (1) within-industry spillovers generated by employment in industry i, (2)
cross-industry spillovers from other industries, (3) national industry-specific factors
that affect industry i in all locations, (4) city-specific factors that affect all industries
in a location, and (5) aggregate changes in the wage (and thus national labor supply)
that affect all industries and locations. To highlight that this expression incorporates
both within and cross-industry spillovers we have pulled the within-industry spillover
term out of the summation.
This expression for city-industry growth will motivate our empirical specification.
One feature that is worth noting here is that we have two factors, city-level aggregate
spillovers (ψct ) and other time-varying city factors (λct ), both of which vary at the
city-year level. Empirically we will not be able to separate these positive and negative
effects and so we will only be able to identify their net impact. Similarly, we cannot
separate positive and negative effects that vary at the industry-year level.
There are at least two promising alternative theories that may yield an empirical specification similar to the expression generated by our model. One such theory
could combine static inter-industry connections, such as pecuniary spillovers through
intermediate-goods sales, with changing transport costs.9 A second alternative combines static agglomeration forces with a friction that results in a slow transition towards the static equilibrium. Our empirical exercises cannot make a sharp distinction
between the mechanisms described in our framework and these alternatives, so they
should not be interpreted as a direct test of the particular agglomeration mechanism
described by the theory.

Further discussion of a theory of this type is available in Appendix A.1.

Empirical setting and data

This study looks at English cities over the period 1851-1911. This historical setting
offers several advantages when studying agglomeration economies. First, there was a
very limited amount of government involvement in the economy, and particularly for
our purposes, the lack of place-based economic interventions. In modern economies
these interventions can be large (Greenstone & Moretti (2004), Kline & Moretti
(2013)), perhaps large enough to impact estimates of agglomeration economies. Second, this period was characterized by fairly high levels of labor mobility; some authors, such as Baines (1994) argue that internal migration was easier during this
period than it is in Britain today.10 Third, local governments placed very few limits
on development. The first town planning act in Britain was passed in 1909, at the
very end of our period, was limited in its extent, and was implemented too slowly to
have substantially impacted the period we study.11 This contrasts sharply with many
modern economies, where limits on local development have a substantial impact on
city growth (Glaeser et al. (2005)). Fourth, even in 1851 the urban system in Britain
was well-established. For instance, Dittmar (2011) argues that Gibrat’s law emerged
in Europe by 1800, suggesting that the urban system was close to spatial equilibrium
during this period. This is a good fit for our model, where the economy is in spatial
equilibrium period-by-period.12
The main database used in this study was constructed from thousands of pages of
original British Census of Population summary reports. The decennial Census data
were collected by trained registrars during a relatively short time period, usually a
few days in April of each census year. As part of the census, individuals were asked
to provide one or more occupations, but the reported occupations correspond more
closely to industries than to what we think of as occupations today.13
10

Baines writes, “Although it is notoriously difficult to measure, we can be fairly sure that internal
migration rates were high in the nineteenth century...We could also say that both the housing and
labor markets were more open than today and that migrants were less likely to be deterred by the
problems of educating children or looking after relatives.”
11
The 1909 town planning act allowed British cities to implement town planning in a limited way,
but did not make such planning mandatory. Sutcliffe (1988) reports that by 1913 only 66 towns
were preparing town planning schemes and in only three towns had such schemes been approved by
the Local Government Board, the main oversight body.
12
In contrast, Desmet & Rappaport (2014) find that Gibrat’s law didn’t emerge in the U.S. until
the middle of the 20th century due to the entry of new locations, which suggests that the U.S. was
on a long transition path over that period and could have been far from spatial equilibrium.
13
In fact, in 1921 the Census office renamed what had previously been called “occupation” to be

11

A unique feature of this database is that the information is drawn from a full
census. Virtually every person in the towns we study provided information on their
occupation and all of these answers are reflected in the employment counts in our
data. This contrasts with data based on census samples, which often use just 5% and
sometimes just 1% of the available data.14
The database includes the 31 cities for which occupation data were reported in
each year from 1851-1911. These cities include 28-34% of the English population over
the period we study. The geographic extent of these cities does change over time as
the cities grow, a feature that we view as desirable for the purposes of our study.15
Table 1 provides a list of the cities included in the database, as well as the 1851
population of each city, the number of workers in the city in 1851, and the number of
workers in 1851 that are working in one of the industry groups that are used in the
analysis.16 A map showing the location of these cities in England is available in the
Appendix. In general, our analysis industries cover most of the working population
of the cities.
The occupations listed in the census reports closely correspond to industries, an
important feature for our purposes. Examples from 1851 include “Banker”, “Glass
Manufacture” or “Cotton manufacture”. The database does include a few occupations that do not directly correspond to industries, such as “Labourer”, “Mechanic”,
or “Gentleman”, but these are a relatively small share of the population. These
categories are not included in the analysis.
A major challenge faced in using these data is that the occupational categories
listed in the census reports varied over time. To deal with this issue we combined
multiple industries in order to construct consistent industry groupings over the study
“industry” and then introduced a new set of data on actual occupations.
14
We have experimented with data based on a census sample (from the U.S.) and found that, when
cutting the data to the city-industry level, sampling error has a substantial effect on the consistency
and robustness of the results obtained even when the analysis is confined only to large cities.
15
Other studies in the same vein, such as Michaels et al. (2013), also use metropolitan boundaries
that expand over time. The alternative is working with fixed geographic units. While that may
be preferred for some types of work, given the growth that characterizes most of the cities in our
sample, using fixed geographic units would mean either that the early observations would include a
substantial portion of rural land surrounding the city, or that a substantial portion of city growth
would not be part of our sample in the later years. Either of these options is undesirable.
16
Much of the remaining working population is employed by the government or in agricultural
work. For example, in Portsmouth, the large gap between working population and workers in the
analysis industries is due to the fact that this was a major base for the Royal Navy.

on (1) the census’ occupation classes, and (2) the name of the occupation. This
process generates 26 consistent private sector occupation categories. Of these, 23 can
be matched to the connections matrices used in the analysis. Table 2 describes the

Industries marked with a * are available in the database but are not used in the baseline analysis
because they cannot be linked to categories in the 1907 British input-output table.

To gain some understanding of these data, Table 3 describes the pattern of industry agglomeration across the analysis cities using the index from Ellison & Glaeser
(1997). We can see that Britain’s main manufacturing and export industries, such as
“Textiles”, “Metal & Machines”, and “Shipbuilding” show high levels of geographic
agglomeration.17 Many non-traded services or retail industries, including “Merchants,
agents, etc.”, “Construction”, and “Shopkeepers, salesmen, etc.” show low levels of
agglomeration. It is somewhat surprising that a few of the service industries, such
as “Professionals” and “General services” show evidence of agglomeration. Table 12
17

Shipbuilding shows an upward trend reflecting the shift to capital-intensive iron ships.

14

in the Appendix shows that this pattern is driven by London. Overall, the median
level of industry agglomeration is between 0.020 and 0.027. This is comparable to
the levels reported for the modern U.S. economy by Ellison & Glaeser (1997) and
somewhat larger than the levels reported for the modern British economy by Faggio
et al. (2013).18
This study also requires a set of matrices measuring the pattern of connections
between industries. These measures should reflect the channels through which ideas
may flow between industries. Existing literature provides some guidance here. Marshall (1890) suggested that firms may benefit from connections operating through
input-output flows, the sharing of labor pools, or other types of technology spillovers.
The use of input-output connections is supported by recent literature showing that
firms share information with their customers or suppliers. For example, Javorcik
(2004) and Kugler (2006) provide evidence that the presence of foreign firms (FDI)
affects the productivity of upstream and downstream domestic firms. To reflect this
channel, we use an input-output table constructed by Thomas (1987) based on the
1907 British Census of Production (Britain’s first industrial census). This matrix is
divided into 41 industry groups. We construct two variables: IOinij , which gives
the share of industry i’s intermediate inputs that are sourced from industry j, and
IOoutij which gives the share of industry i’s sales of intermediate goods that are
purchased by industry j. The main drawback in using these matrices is that they are
for intermediate goods; they will not capture the pattern of capital goods flows.

18

Using industry data for 459 manufacturing industries at the four-digit level and 50 states, Ellison
& Glaeser (1997) calculate a mean agglomeration index of 0.051 and a median of 0.026. For Britain,
Faggio et al. (2013) calculate industry agglomeration using 94 3-digit manufacturing industries and
84 urban travel-to-work areas. They obtain a mean agglomeration index of 0.027 and a median of
0.009. Kim (1995) calculates an alternative measure of agglomeration for the U.S. during the late
19th and early 20th centuries, but given that he studies only manufacturing industries, and given
the substantial differences between his industry definitions and our own, it is difficult to directly
compare these patterns with his results.

15

Table 3: Industry agglomeration patterns based on the Ellison & Glaeser index

This table reports industry agglomeration in each year based on the index from Ellison & Glaeser
(1997). This approach adjusts for the size of plants in an industry using an industry Herfindahl
index. We construct these Herfindahl indices using the firm size data reported in the 1851 Census
and apply the same Herfindahl for all years, since firm-size data are not reported in later Censuses.
This may introduce bias for some industries, such as shipbuilding, where evidence suggests that the
average size of firms increased substantially over the study period. Some analysis industries are not
included in this table due to lack of firm size data.

Another channel for knowledge flow is the movement of workers, who may carry
ideas between industries. Research by Poole (2013) and Balsvik (2011), using data
from Brazil and Norway, respectively, has highlighted this channel of knowledge flow.
To reflect this channel, we construct two different measures of the similarity of the
workforces used by different industries. The first measure is based on the demographic
characteristics of workers (their age and gender) from the 1851 Census. These features
16

had an important influence on the types of jobs a worker could hold during the period
we study.19 For any two industries, our demographic-based measure of labor force
similarity, EM Pij , is constructed by dividing workers in each industry into these
four available bins (male/female and over20/under20) and calculating the correlation
in shares across the industries. A second measure of labor-force similarity, based
on the occupations found in each industry, is more similar to the measures used in
previous studies. This measure is built using U.S. census data from 1880, which
reports the occupational breakdown of employment by industry. We map the U.S.
industry categories to the categories available in our analysis data. Then, for any
two industries our occupation-based measure of labor force similarity, OCCij is the
correlation in the vector of employment shares for each occupation.
In addition to the primary inter-industry connection matrices described above, we
will also conduct robustness exercises in Section 6 using two additional matrices. One
of these is an input-output table for 1841 constructed by Horrell et al. (1994). This
table is used to construct a matrix of supplier industries, IOin1841 and customer industries, IOout1841, mirroring those available from the 1907 table. These matrices,
which can be used with 12 more aggregated industry categories, have the advantage that they come from a decade prior to the first observation in the city-industry
database. This can help us deal with potential concerns related to the endogeneity
of the pattern of input-output connections, as well as concerns that these patterns
may have changed substantially over the study period. We have also constructed a
matrix reflecting the technological similarity of industries. This matrix, which we call
T ECH, is based on patent data from 1800-1841 which have been hand-matched to
industry categories by Nuvolari & Tartari (2011). Technological similarity between
industries i and j is measured based on the share of inventors patenting in industry
i that also patent in industry j, under the assumption that it is easier for inventors
to move back and forth between more technologically similar industries. This matrix
is available for nine aggregated industry categories related to manufacturing, mining,
construction, or utilities.
Finally, we have collected data on a variety of other industry and city characteristics. The 1851 Census of Population was particularly detailed, and provides
information on firm sizes in each industry at the national level. From the 1907 input19

For example, textile industries employed substantial amounts of female and child labor, while
metal and heavy machinery industry jobs were almost exclusively reserved for adult males.

17

output table, we have measures of the share of industry output that is sold directly
to households, as well as the share exported abroad. The 1907 Census of Production
provides us with information on the total wage bill of each industry and the value of
output for each industry. These are used to construct, for each industry, estimates of
the ratio of labor cost to total sales and, together with the input-output table, the
ratio of intermediate cost to total sales. Finally, we collect data on the distance between cities (as the crow flies) from Google Maps, which we will use when considering
cross-city effects in Section 7.

Empirical approach

The starting point for our analysis is based on Equation 7, which represents the growth
rate of a city-industry as a function of the learning spillovers as well as time-varying
city-specific and national industry-specific factors. Rewriting this as a regression
equation we have,
4 ln(Lict+1 ) = τ̃ii ln(Lict ) +

where 4 is the first difference operator, τ̃ii and τ̃ki include the coefficient 1−α
is a full set of city-year effects and φit is a full set of industry-year effects. The first
term on the right hand side represents within-industry spillovers, while the second
term represents cross-industry spillovers.20

One issue with Equation 8 is that there are too many parameters for us to credibly
estimate given the available data. In order to reduce the number of parameters, we
need to put additional structure on the spillover terms. As discussed in the previous
section, the recent literature on knowledge spillovers motivates us to parametrize
the connections between industries using the available input-output and labor force
similarity matrices:
20

We purposely omitted the last term of Equation 7, 4 ln(w̄t+1 ), because although it could be
estimated as a year-specific constant, it would be collinear with both the (summation of) industryyear and city-year effects. Moreover, in any given year we also need to drop one of the city or
industry dummies in order to avoid collinearity. In all specifications we chose to drop the industryyear dummies associated with the “General services” sector.

Instead of a large number of parameters measuring spillovers across industries, Equation 9 now contains only four parameters multiplying four (weighted) summations of
log employment. Summary statistics for the summed cross-industry spillover terms
are available in Appendix Table 13.
There is a clear parallel between the specification in Equation 9 and the empirical
approach used in the convergence literature (Barro & Sala-i Martin (1992)). A central
debate in this literature has revolved around the inclusion of fixed effects for the
cross-sectional units (see, e.g., Caselli et al. (1996)). In our context, the inclusion of
such characteristics could help control for location and industry-specific factors that
affect the growth rate of industry and are correlated with initial employment levels.
However, the inclusion of city-industry fixed effects in Equation 9 will introduce a
mechanical bias in our estimated coefficients (Hurwicz (1950), Nickell (1981)). This
bias is a particular concern in a setting where the time-series is limited. Solutions to
these issues have been offered by Arellano & Bond (1991), Blundell & Bond (1998),
and others, yet these procedures can also generate biased results, as shown by Hauk Jr.
& Wacziarg (2009). In a recent review, Barro (2012) uses data covering 40-plus years
and argues (p. 20) that in this setting, “the most reliable estimates of convergence
rates come from systems that exclude country fixed effects but include an array of X
variables to mitigate the consequence of omitted variables.” Our approach essentially
follows this advice, but with the additional advantage that we have two cross-sectional
dimensions, which allows for the inclusion of flexible controls in the form of timevarying city and industry fixed effects.

19

There are two issues to address at this point. First, there could be a measurement
error in Lict . Since this variable appears both on the left and right hand side, this
would mechanically generate an attenuation bias in our within-industry spillover estimates. Moreover, since Lict is correlated with the other explanatory variables, such
measurement error would also bias the remaining estimates. We deal with measurement error in Lict on the right hand side by instrumenting it with lagged city-industry
employment.21 This approach is somewhat similar to the approach introduced by
Bartik (1991). Under the assumption that the measurement error in any given cityindustry pair is iid across cities and time, our instrument is LInst
ict = Lict−1 × gi−ct ,
where Lict−1 is the lag of Lict and gi−ct is the decennial growth rate in industry i
computed using employment levels in all cities except city c.
Second, we are also concerned that there may be omitted variables that affect both
the level of employment in industry j and the growth in employment in industry i.
Such variables could potentially bias our estimated coefficients on both the crossindustry and (when j = i) the within-industry spillovers. For instance, if there
is some factor not included in our model which causes growth in two industries i
and k 6= i in the same city, a naive estimation would impute such growth to the
spillover effect from k to i, thus biasing the estimated spillover upward. Our lagged
instrumentation approach can also help us deal with these concerns. Specifically,
when using instruments with a one-decade lag to address endogeneity concerns the
exclusion restriction is that there is not some omitted variable that is correlated with
employment in some industry k in period t and affects employment growth in industry
i from period t + 1 to t + 2. Moreover, the omited variable cannot affect growth in all
industries in a location, else it would be captured by the city-year fixed effect, nor can
it affect the growth rate in industry i in all cities.22 Thus, while our approach does not
allow us to rule out all possible confounding factors, it allows us to narrow the set of
potential confounding forces relative to most previous work in this area. Now, for the
P
cross-industry case, the summation terms in Equation 9 such as k6=i IOinki ln(Lkct )
P
Inst
are instrumented with k6=i IOinki ln(LInst
kct ), where Lkct is computed as described
above.

21

This approach is inspired in part by Combes et al. (2011), who discuss the possibility of using
lagged instrumentation to study agglomeration economies.
22
The results are not sensitive to the length of the lag used in the instrumentation. We have
experimented with two- and three-decade lags and obtained essentially the same results.

20

The estimation is performed using OLS or, when using instruments, two-stage
least squares. Correlated errors are a concern in these regressions. Specifically, we
are concerned about serial correlation, which Bertrand et al. (2004) argue can be a
serious concern in panel data regressions, though this is perhaps less of a concern for
us given the relatively small time dimension in our data. A second concern is that
industries within the same city are likely to have correlated errors. A third concern,
highlighted by Conley (1999) and more recently by Barrios et al. (2012), is spatial
correlation occurring across cities. Here the greatest concern is that error terms may
be correlated within the same industry across cities (though the results presented in
section 7 suggest that cross-city effects are modest).
To deal with all of these concerns we use multi-dimensional clustered standard
errors following work by Cameron et al. (2011) and Thompson (2011). We cluster
by (1) city-industry, which allows for serial correlation; (2) city-year, which allows
correlated errors across industries in the same city and year; and (3) industry-year,
which allows for spatial correlation across cities within the same industry and year.
This method relies on asymptotic results based on the dimension with the fewest
number of clusters. In our case this is 23 industries × 6 years = 138, which should be
large enough to avoid serious small-sample concerns. Because using multi-dimensional
standard errors is not yet standard in the literature, we also report more conventional
robust standard errors in all results tables.
To simplify the exposition, we will hereafter collectively refer to the set of regressors ln(Lict ), f or i = 1...I as the within variables. Similarly, with a small abuse of
P
notation the term k6=i IOinki ln(Lkct ) is referred to as IOin, and so on for IOout,
EM P , and OCC. We collectively refer to the latter terms as the between regressors
since they are the parametrized counterpart of the spillovers across industries.

5

Main results

Our main regression results are based on the specification described in Equation 9.
Regressions based on this specification generate results that can tell us about crossindustry spillovers, within-industry spillovers, and city-wide factors. In the following
subsections, we will discuss results related to each of these in turn, but it is important
to keep in mind that these results are coming out of regressions in which all of these
21

factors are present. We begin by considering the pattern of spillovers across industries.

5.1

Cross-industry spillovers

Our estimation strategy involves using four measures for the pattern of cross-industry
spillovers: forward input-output linkages, backward input-output linkages, and two
measures of labor force similarity. We begin our analysis, in Table 4 by looking at
results that include only one of these proxies at a time. Columns 1-3 include only the
forward input-output linkages; Columns 1 presents OLS results; Column 2 presents
results with lagged instrumentation on the within terms; and Column 3 uses lagged
instrumentation for both the within and between terms. A similar pattern is used for
backward input-output linkages in Columns 4-6, the demographic-based labor force
similarity measure in Columns 7-9, and the occupation-based labor force similarity
measure in Columns 10-12.
These results show strong positive spillovers through forward input-output connections, suggesting that local suppliers play an important role in industry growth.
The importance of local suppliers to industry growth is perhaps the clearest and most
robust result emerging from our analysis. In terms of magnitude, the coefficients in
Table 4 suggest that a one standard deviation increase in the local presence of supplier industries (IOin) would result in an increase in city-industry growth of 13.9-19.3
percent. There is little evidence of positive effects operating through local buyers.
The results do provide some evidince that the presence of other industries using similar labor pools may increase growth, particularly when using the more detailed OCC
measure. A comparison across columns for each spillover measure shows that the IV
results do not differ from the OLS results in a statistically significant way, suggesting
that any measurement error or omitted variables concerns addressed by instruments
are not generating substantial bias in the OLS results.
We do not report first-stage regression results for our instrumental variables regressions because these involve a very large number of first-stage regressions. Instead,
for each specification we report the test statistics for the Lagrange Multiplier underidentification test based on Kleibergen & Paap (2006) as well as the test static for
weak instruments test based on the Kleibergen-Paap Wald statistic.23 It is clear from
23

These test statistics are calculated under robust standard errors because the methodology for
calculating these test statistics under multidimensional standard errors is still being refined.

22

these statistics that weak instruments are not a substantial concern in any of the
specifications used in this study.

Table 5 considers all four channels simultaneously. Columns 1 presents OLS results. In Column 2 we instrument the within terms. In Column 3 we use instruments
for both the within and between terms. The results are generally similar to those
23

from Table 4; the presence of local suppliers or industries employing a similar labor
force both appear to enhance city-industry growth. The presence of local buyers has
no positive effect. In the Appendix, we investigate the robustness of these results to
dropping individual industries or individual cities from the analysis database. These
exercises show that the significance of the estimates on the IOin and OCC channels
are robust to dropping any city or any industry. However, the estimated coefficient
and confidence levels for the IOout coefficient is sensitive to the exclusion of particular
industries.

instruments require a lagged employment term. Thus, data from 1851 are not available for these
regressions. Acronyms: wtn = within, btn = between. “KP under id.” denotes the test statistic
for the Lagrange Multiplier underidentification test based on Kleibergen & Paap (2006). “KP

Wald statistic.

Based on the results from Column 3 of Table 5, a one standard deviation increase
24

(3.24) in the presence of local suppliers (the IOin channel) increases city-industry
growth by 20%. Turning the the occupational similarity channel, OCC, a one standard deviation leads to a 17% increase in city industry growth when using the results
from Column 3 of Table 5. Thus, both of these channels appear to exert a substantial
positive effect on city-industry growth.
The results presented so far describe coefficients generated using all industries,
where each industry is given equal weight. We may be concerned that these results
are being driven primarily by smaller industries or smaller cities. To check this,
we have also calculate weighted regressions, where the set of observations for each
city-industry is weighted based on employment in that city-industry in 1851.24 The
results are presented in Table 6. These weighted regressions continue to highlight the
important role played by local suppliers. Thus, this result is not driven by smaller
industries or cities. However, we no longer observe positive results associated with
the occupational similarity measure. This suggests that the positive impact of local
industries employing similar workers observed in Table 5 is being driven by smaller
industries, an interesting result in itself.
The results discussed so far reveal average patterns across all industries. An additional advantage of our empirical approach is that it is also possible to estimate
industry-specific coeffients in order to look for (1) heterogeneity in the industries that
benefit from each type of inter-industry connection or (2) heterogeneity in the industries that produce each type of inter-industry connections. In Appendix A.3.2,
we estimate industry-specific coefficients for both spillover-benefiting and spilloverproducing industries and then compare them to a set of available industry characteristics such as firm size, export and final goods sales shares, and labor or intermediate
cost shares. With only 20 estimated industry coefficients we cannot draw strong
conclusions from these relationships. However, our results do suggest several interesting patterns. The strongest result is that industries that benefit from or produce
spillovers through the OCC channel tend to have a higher labor cost to sales ratio,
a finding that is reasonable if not surprising. We also observe a consistent negative
relationship between firm size and all types of inter-industry connections. While this
relationship is not statistically significant, it is consistent across all spillover types
24

Specifically, this is done by weighting the importance of each city-industry observation based on
the number of workers it represented in 1851. We base the weights for all years on initial city-industry
employment to avoid the potential for endogeneity in the city-industry weights.

25

and it fits well with existing work highlighting the importance of inter-industry connections for smaller firms Chinitz (1961). Next, we consider within-industry effects.

Within-industry spillovers

Our analysis can also help us understand the strength of within-industry spillovers,
reflected in the ln(Lict ) term in Equation 8.25 When analyzing these results, it is
important to keep in mind that they reflect the net effect of within-industry agglom25

In a static context these are often referred to as localization economies.

26

eration forces, which may be generated through a balance between agglomeration
forces and negative forces such as competition or mean-reversion due to the diffusion of technologies across cities.26 We cannot identify the strength of local withinindustry agglomeration forces independent of counteracting forces. However, it is the
net strength of these forces, which we are able to estimate, that is most relevant
for understanding the contribution of within-industry agglomeration forces to city
growth.
Figure 1 presents the within-industry coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for
regression specifications corresponding to Columns 3 of Table 5, where lagged instruments are used for both the within and between terms. These results suggest that
within-industry effects are often negative, consistent with competition for scarce local
inputs or other within-industry congestion forces. In only one industry, shipbuilding,
do we observe positive within-industry effects. This industry was characterized by
increasing returns and strong patterns of geographic concentration. Within-industry
agglomeration benefits, it would appear, are more the exception than the rule.
We can also compare these estimated industry-specific coefficients to industry
characteristics such as average firm size, the share of exports or final goods in total
sales, or the ratio of labor or input costs to total sales. This is done in Appendix
A.3.2. With such a small number of industry coefficients we cannot draw strong
conclusions from these results. However, we do observe some evidence that withinindustry connections are more important in industries with larger firm sizes, which
contrasts with the consistent negative relationship that we observe between firm size
and cross-industry benefits.

26

This issue is discussed in Dumais et al. (2002).

5.3

City-size effects and the aggregate strength of agglomeration forces

Next, we look at the effect of city size on city-industry growth. In standard urban
models, the impact of agglomeration forces is balanced by congestion forces related to
city size, operating through channels such as higher housing prices or greater commute
times. In our model, this congestion force is reflected in the λct term. There may also
be agglomeration forces related to city size, apart from the other agglomeration forces
we study.27 This agglomeration force is represented by the φct term in the model.
Empirically, both the congestion and agglomeration forces related to overall city
size will be captured by the estimated city-time effects. Thus, examining these es27

There is a substantial empirical literature, reviewed by Combes & Gobillon (Forthcoming), that
focuses on estimating agglomeration economies related to overall city size. City-size agglomeration
forces also appear in existing theories, such as Davis & Dingel (2012), though Davis & Dingel specify
a model in which the aggregate city-size agglomeration force will have heterogeneous effects across
industries.

28

timated city-time coefficients offers an opportunity for assessing the net impact of
congestion and agglomeration force related to overall city size. Also, the difference
between these estimated city-time effects and actual city growth rates must be due
to the impact of the other agglomeration forces in the estimation equation. Thus,
comparing the estimated city-time effects to actual city growth rates allows us to
quantify the overall strength of the cross-industry agglomeration forces captured by
our measures.
To make this comparison more concrete, consider the graphs in Figure 2. The
dark blue diamond symbols in each graph describe, for each decade starting in 1861,
the relationship between the actual growth rate of city working population and the
log of city population at the beginning of the decade. The slopes of the fitted lines
for these series fluctuate close to zero, suggesting that on average Gibrat’s Law holds
for the cities in our data.
We want to compare the relationship between city size and city growth in the
actual data, as shown by the dark blue diamonds in Figure 2, to the relationship
between these variables obtained while controlling for cross-industry agglomeration
forces. To do this, we estimate the following regression specification:

4 ln(Lict+1 )

= β1

X

IOinki ln(Lkct ) + β2

X

k6=i

+ β3

X

IOoutki ln(Lkct )

(10)

k6=i

EM Pki ln(Lkct ) + β4

k6=i

X

CROSS
OCCki ln(Lkct ) + θct
+ φit + eict .

k6=i

This specification is exactly the same as our baseline specification except that the
within-industry terms have been omitted because the negative coefficients estimated
on those terms in the baseline specification suggests that within-industry employment
is generally not an agglomeration force.
The red squares in Figure 2 describe the relationship between the estimated cityCROSS
year coefficients for each decade, θct
, and the log of city population at the beginning of each decade. In essence, these describe the relationship between city size
and city growth after controlling for national industry growth trends and the agglomeration forces generated by cross-industry spillovers. We can draw two lessons from
CROSS
these graphs. First, in all years the fitted lines based on the θct
terms slope

29

downward more steeply than the slopes on the fitted lines for actual city growth.
This suggests that, once we control for cross-industry agglomeration forces, city size
is negatively related to city growth, consistent with the idea that there are city-size
congestion forces. Second, the difference between the slopes of the two fitted lines can
be interpreted as the aggregate effect of the various agglomeration forces in our model
averaged across cities. Put simply, if we can add up the strength of the convergence
force in any period and compare it to the actual pattern of city growth, then the
difference must be equal to the strength of the agglomeration forces.
The strength of these effects can be quantified in terms of the implied convergence
rate following the approach of Barro & Sala-i Martin (1992). To do so, we run the
following regressions:
CROSS
θct
= a0 + a1 ln(W ORKpopct ) + ct

(11)

GrowthW ORKpopct = b0 + b1 ln(W ORKpopct ) + ct

(12)

where θct is the estimated city-time effect for the decade from t to t + 1, W ORKpopct
is the working population of the city in year t, and GrowthW ORKpopct is the actual
growth rate of the city from t to t + 1. These regressions are run separately for each
decade from 1861 to 1911. Convergence rates can be calculated using the estimated
a1 and b1 coefficients.
The results are presented in the top panel of Table 7. The two left-hand columns
describe the results from Equation 11 and the annualized city-size divergence rate
implied by these estimates. The next two columns describe similar results based on
Equation 12. The difference between these two city-size divergence rates, given in
the right-hand column, describes the aggregate strength of the agglomeration force
reflected in the cross-industry terms. These results suggest that the strength of city
agglomeration forces, in terms of the implied divergence rate, was generally around
2.2-3.3% per decade. In the bottom panel of Table 7 we calculate similar results
CROSS
except that the θct
terms are obtained using regressions in which each observation
is weighted based on the employment in each city-industry in 1851. These results
suggest agglomeration forces equal to an implied divergence rate of 2.1-3.3% per
decade.

unweighted regressions while the results in the botton panel are based on city-time effects estimated
using weighted regressions based on city-industry employment in 1851.

We may be concerned that the results described in Table 7 are driven in part by
CROSS
the inclusion of industry-time effects in the regressions used to obtain the θct
terms. One way to assess this is to estimate alternative city-time effects from,
FE
4 ln(Lict+1 ) = θct
+ φit + eict ,

and then estimate,
32

(13)

FE
θct
= c0 + c1 ln(W ORKpopct ) + ct .

(14)

Because the only difference between the specification in Equation 10 and that in
Equation 13 is the inclusion of the cross-industry agglomeration terms, we can be
FE
CROSS
terms
terms and the θct
sure that any differences between the estimated θct
are due to cross-industry agglomeration effects. The results, in Table 8, show similar
pattners to those described previously. It is clear that the measured strength of the
agglomeration force is not simply a byproduct of controling for industry-time effects.

regressions while the results in the botton panel are based on city-time effects estimated using
weighted regressions based on city-industry employment in 1851.

33

Finally, we can use a similar exercise to estimate the aggregate strength of the
convergence force due to within-industry effects. We begin by estimating,
W IT HIN
4 ln(Lict+1 ) = τ̃ii ln(Lict ) + θct
+ φit + eict ,

(15)

and then estimating,
W IT HIN
= d0 + d1 ln(W ORKpopct ) + ct .
θct

(16)

We then calculate the convergence force associated with the within-industry terms
using the same approach that we used previously. Table 9 describes the results.
The negative measured divergence force in this table highlights that within-industry
effects, on net, act as a convergence force. The strength of this force is sensitive
to whether the regressions are weighted, which suggests that the negative withinindustry employment effects tend to be stronger for smaller industries.
There are some caveats to keep in mind when assessing these results. First,
there are likely to be agglomeration forces not captured by our estimation. These
omitted agglomeration forces may be partially reflected in the city-year fixed effects,
which would lead us to understate the strength of the agglomeration forces. Second,
some congestion forces may also be captured by our cross-industry terms. Thus, the
strength of the cross-industry agglomeration force measured here is likely to be a
lower bound.

regressions while the results in the botton panel are based on city-time effects estimated using
weighted regressions based on city-industry employment in 1851.

Robustness: Alternative connection matrices

This section revisits the analysis presented above using some alternative measures of
inter-industry connections. In particular, we use an alternative matrix of input-output
connections constructed by Horrell et al. (1994) for Britain in 1841. Generating
results with this alternative matrix, which comes from before the study period, can
help address concerns that the results we find are dependent on the specific set of
matrices we consider or are due to a process of endogenous inter-industry connection
35

formation. The cost of using this matrix is that we are forced to work with a smaller
set of 12 more aggregated industry categories.28
We also introduce a matrix of industry technological similarity. This matrix reflects the possiblity that technology may flow more rapidly between more technologically similar industries. While we have not been able to construct a technological similarity matrix for the more detailed industry categories used in the previous section, it
is possible to construct measures of technological similarity for the more aggregated
categories corresponding to the 1841 input-output matrix. As discussed in Section
3, this is done using patent data from 1800-1841.29 This matrix is available for nine
aggregate industry categories. Note that the sample size drops somewhat when analyzing the technological similarity matrix, since the transportation, distribution and
service industries are not included in that matrix.
Because we are now working with a smaller number of industry categories, we
focus our analysis on regressions that incorporate one spillover channel at a time.
Table 10 describes the results.30 These results also suggest that the presence of local
suppliers positively influenced city-industry growth. In terms of magnitude, these
results imply that a one standard deviation increase in presence of local suppliers will
increase city-industry growth by 9.9-13.8%. There is also some evidence that local
buyers may have positively influenced growth, but further exploration reveals that
this finding is sensitive to the exclusion of particular industries. There is also evidence
that industries may have benefitted from the presence of other occupationally-similar
industries in the same locality, but these results are not as strong as the benefits
of local suppliers. A one standard deviation increase in the demographically-similar
local industries (EM P ) is consistent with an increase in city-industry growth of 713%, while a one standard deviation increase in occupationally-similar industries
(OCC) is consistent with an increase in city-industry growth of 7.6-9.5%. Finally,
while we do observe positive coefficients on the T ECH term, we do not observe strong
evidence that industries benefitted from the local presence of other technologically

The industry categories are: “Mining & quarrying,” “Food, drink & tobacco”, “Metals & Machinery,” “Oils, chemicals & drugs,” “Textiles, clothing & leather goods,” “Earthenware & bricks,”
“Other manufactured goods,” “Construction,” “Gas & water,” “Transportation,” “Distribution,”
and “All other services.”

rough nature of the available technology similarity matrix.

To summarize, we find that all three types of inter-industry connections – through
37

input-output linkages, occupational similarity, and technological similarity – exhibit
a positive relationship to city-industry growth. Of these, we find the strongest effects
reflected by the input-output channels, followed by occupational similarity. This
ordering bears a striking resemblence to the results obtained by Ellison et al. (2010)
using modern U.S. data and a very different set of industry categories, suggesting
that there may be substantial persistence in the importance of particular connection
channels.

7

Robustness: Cross-city effects

In this section, we extend our analysis to consider the possibility that city-industry
growth may also be affected by forces due to other nearby cities. We consider two
potential channels for these cross-city effects. First, industries may benefit from proximity to consumers in nearby cities. This market potential effect has been suggested
by Hanson (2005), who finds that regional demand linkages play an important role
in generating spatial agglomeration using modern U.S. data. Second, industries may
benefit from spillovers from other industries in nearby towns, through any of the
channels that we have identified. We analyze these effects using the more detailed
industry categories from Section 5.
There is substantial variation in the proximity of cities in our database to other
nearby cities (see the Appendix for a map). Some cities, particularly those in Lancashire, West Yorkshire, and the North Midlands, are located in close proximity to a
number of other nearby cities. Others, such as Norwich, Hull, and Portsmouth are
relatively more isolated.
We begin our analysis by collecting data on the distance (as the crow flies) between
each of the cities in our database, which we call distanceij . Using these, we construct
a measure for the remoteness of one city from another dij = exp(−distanceij ).31 Our
measures of market potential for each city is then,

M Pct =


X
ln  P OPjt



∗ dcj  .

j6=c
31

This distance weighting measure is motivated by Hanson (2005). We have also explored using
dij = 1/distanceij as the distance weighting measure and this delivers similar results.

38

where P OPjt is the population of city j. This differs slightly from Hanson’s approach,
which uses income in a city instead of population, due to the fact that income at the
city level is not available for the period we study.
We also want to measure the potential for cross-industry spillovers occurring across
cities. We measure proximity to an industry i in other cities as the distance-weighted
sum of log employment in that industry across all other cities. Our full regression
specification, including both cross-city market potential and spillover effects, is then,

One difference between this and our baseline specification is that we now include
city fixed effects (θc ) in place of city-year effects because city-year effects would be
perfectly correlated with the market potential measure. To help deal with city-size
effects, we also include the log of W ORKpopct , the working population of city c in
period t. To simplify the exposition and in analogy with the previous section, we will

refer to the cross-city term k6=i IOinki j6=c djc ∗ ln(Lkjt ) as IOin ∗ d, and similarly
for the other cross-city terms IOout ∗ d, EM P ∗ d, and OCC ∗ d.
The results generated using this specification are shown in Table 11. The first
thing to take away from this table is that our baseline results are essentially unchanged
when we include the additional cross-city terms. The city employment term in the
fifth column reflects the negative growth impact of city size. The coefficients on the
market potential measure is always positive but not statistically significant.

The results do not provide statistically significant evidence that cross-city spillovers
matter through any of the channels that we measure. However, these results are imprecisely measured. The coefficients estimated on the IOin ∗ dist term suggest that
a one standard deviation increase in the presence of suppliers in other nearby cities
could increase city-industry growth by 6.1-18.3%. The coefficients on the EM P term
are consistent with effects of a similar magnitude. Thus, we should not rule out important cross-city effects based on these results. However, it is clear that omitted
cross-city effects are not driving our findings regarding the importance of within-city
cross-industry agglomeration forces.

Conclusion

In the introduction, we posed a number of questions about the nature of localized
agglomeration forces. The main contribution of this study is to provide a theoretically
grounded empirical approach that can be used to address these questions and the
detailed city-industry panel data needed to implement it.
We can now provide some answers for the period we study. First, we find evidence that cross-industry agglomeration economies were more important than withinindustry agglomeration forces for generating city employment growth. Within-industry
effects are, on net, generally negative, but may be positive in a small number of industries such as shipbuilding. This suggests that industries clusters, which have attracted
substantial attention, are more the exception than the rule. Second, our results suggest that industries grow more rapidly when they co-locate with their suppliers or
with other industries that use occupationally-similar workforces. This result is in
line with arguments made by Jacobs (1969), as well as recent empirical findings. We
document a clear negative relationship between city size and city growth that appears
once we account for agglomeration forces related to a city’s industrial composition.
This suggests that Gibrat’s law is generated by a balance between agglomeration and
dispersion forces. A lower bound estimate of the overall strength of the agglomeration
forces captured by our approach, in terms of the implied annual divergence rate in
city size, is around 2.1-3.3% per decade.
One of the most striking features of our results is how similar they look to some
of the existing findings in the literature, most of which are based on modern U.S. or
41

European data. In particular, the ordering of importance for the different spillover
channels – with input-output paths showing the strongest effects, followed by occupational similarity, and with only weak effects associated with technological similarity
– looks very similar to the ordering obtained by Ellison et al. (2010). This provides
suggestive evidence that there may be substantial persistence in the importance of
these agglomeration economies over time and across space.
The techniques introduced in this paper can be applied in any setting where
sufficiently rich long-run city-industry panel data can be constructed. Recent work
has made progress in constructing data of this type for the U.S. in both the modern
and historical period. Applying our approach to these emerging data sets is one
promising avenue for future work.

Appendix
Theory appendix

The main text presents a simple theoretical framework used to motivate our analysis.
In this appendix, we show that we can add additional complexity to the model without
substantially changing the final estimating equation. In particular, we introduce
capital and intermediate inputs into the production function. The new production
function is,
β
γ
1−α−β−γ
xicf t = Aict Lαicf t Kicf
,
t Iicf t Ricf t

where we have introduced capital inputs, Kicf t , and intermediate inputs Iicf t , into the
production function, while retaining the same basic Cobb-Douglas structure. The
parameters α, β, and γ determine the relative importance of these inputs in the
production process of each industry. For now, we make the simplifying assumption
that these parameters are constant across all industries, but at the end of this section
we discuss the possibility that they may differ across industries. In this extended
model, we make the same assumptions about technology, labor and resources as in
the baseline model.
Capital is mobile across locations with a national price given by rt . The overall
supply of capital in the economy is K̄t . While we could model the evolution of this
object, doing so would merely distract from the key focus of our theory.32 Thus,
to keep things simple we take the overall supply of capital in any given period as
exogenously given. The income from capital is assumed to be spread evenly across
individuals.
The set of intermediate inputs used in production differs across industries, but
within each industry, all firms use inputs in the same fixed proportions. Because we
assume free trade, this feature is a result, rather than an assumption. Let Z be an
input-output matrix, with element zij such that Iit units of intermediate input to
industry i requires Iit zij units of output from industry j, i.e., the production function
32

Moreover, the substantial level of international capital flows that took place during the period that we study suggest that a closed economy model of the evolution of this quantity may be
inappropriate for the empirical setting.

47

for intermediate inputs is Leontief. Then total intermediate demand for the output
P
from industry j is equal to xIO
i Iit zij . With costless trade, each industry will
jt =
face a national-level industry-specific intermediate input price in each period, denoted
qit .
The resulting firm optimization problem is,
max

1−α−β−γ
pit Aict Lα
− w̄t λct Licf t − rt Kicf t − qit Iicf t − dict Ricf t .
icf t Kicf t Iicf t Ricf t

Using the first order conditions, and summing over all firms in a city-industry, we
obtain the following expression for employment in industry i and location c,

Lict =

Aρict pρit



α
w̄t λct

ρ(1−β−γ)

β

!ρβ

γ

(17)

where ρ = 1/(1 − γ − β − α) > 0. This expression tells us that, as in the baseline
model, employment in any industry i and location c will depend on technology in that
industry-location, the fixed resource endowment for that industry-location, factors
that affect the industry in all locations (pit , qit ), city-specific factors (λct ), and factors
that affect the economy as a whole (w̄t , rt ). Note that ρ represents the inverse of
the exponent on fixed city-industry resources. Thus, we can see that the impact of
a city-specific shock that increases costs (higher λct ) on city-industry employment
will be greater the less important are fixed city-industry resources in production, i.e.,
when industries are able to more easily move production to other cities.
Equilibrium within a period is defined as the set of prices {Pt ,pit ,rt ,qit ,dict } and
quantities {DtF ,xict ,Licf t , Kicf t ,Iicf t ,Ricf t } such that given the set of technologies
{Aict },
1) The first order conditions of the firm optimization problem are satisfied

where Mt represents net expenditures on imports and Bt represents the (exogenously
given) amount of savings in the period. For a closed economy model we can set Mt
to zero and then solve for the equilibrium price levels in the economy. Alternatively,
we can consider a (small) open economy case where prices are given and solve for Mt .
We are agnostic between these two approaches.
We continue to use the same expression describing the evolution of technology as
in the baseline model (Equation 4). Starting with Equation 17 for period t + 1, taking
logs, plugging in Equation 4, and then plugging in Equation 17 again (also in logs),
we obtain,

ln(Lict+1 ) − ln(Lict )

where eict = ict+1 − ict is the error term.
Finally, plugging Equation 6 into Equation 18, we obtain,

This expression mirrors the estimating equation given in Equation 7 up to the parameters ρ, β and γ. As in our baseline estimating equation, the change in employment
growth is expressed as a function of the initial level of employment, a set of national
industry-specific factors, a set of city-specific factors that affect all industries, and
national wage and capital rental rates that affect all industries and all cities.
We can use this expression to consider some of the assumptions made in the
main text in more detail. First, consider the possibility that trade costs, rather than
technology spillovers, might be driving the effects we observe. To represent this,
suppose that we modified the model to incorporate trade costs while at the same
time eliminating technology spillovers. Ignoring for now general equilibrium effects,
Equation 19 tells us that trade costs will affect city-industries through either the price
of inputs (e.g., through local suppliers) or the price of outputs (e.g., through market
access). With trade costs, both the input and the output prices faced by firms in
industry i can vary across cities.
Now, focusing on the input prices side, suppose that there are two cities, A and
B, and that City A has many more of industry i suppliers than city B so that the cost
of intermediate inputs to industry i is lower in City A than in City B. From Equation
17 we can see that, all else equal, this implies that employment in industry i will be
larger in City A than in City B in some initial period: this is static agglomeration.
However, as we roll the model forward, Equation 18 shows that, absent other changes,
industry i will not grow faster in City A than in City B. In the absence of other effects,
input-output connections alone cannot act as a dynamic agglomeration force. Where
input-output connections can generate dynamic agglomeration is by transmitting the
effects of other changes, such as falling transport costs. However, falling trade costs
cannot be a sustained force of dynamic agglomeration, since trade costs are bounded
below by zero and were fairly stable over at least part of the period we study.33 This
suggests that input-output connections and trade costs can be an important static
force, but these forces are unlikely to generate the dynamic agglomeration patters
studied here.
A second interesting extension to consider is the possibility that the share of each
input in the production function varies across industries. In particular, suppose that
33

Crafts & Mulatu (2006) conclude that, “falling transport costs had only weak effects on the
location of industry in the period 1870 to 1911.” Jacks et al. (2008) find a rapid fall in external
trade costs prior to 1880, with a much slower decline thereafter.

50

we allow the production function parameters to vary across industries. Indexing these
parameters by i, we now have the following expression for city-industry employment
growth,

ln(Lict+1 ) − ln(Lict )

= ρi τii ln(Lict ) + ρi

X

τki ln(Lkct )

k6=i

h

h
i
+ ρi (1 − βi − γi ) ln(w̄t+1 ) − ln(w̄t )
h
i
+ ρi βi ln(rt+1 ) − ln(rt ) + eict .

We can see that the impact of spillovers on city-industry growth in this setting will
depend on the industry-specific parameter ρi , where ρi = 1/(1−γi −βi −αi ) > 0. This
parameter is the inverse of the exponent on local resources. Thus, the more important
are fixed local resources in the production process, the weaker will be the impact of
spillover on city-industry employment growth. This makes sense because when fixed
local resources are important it is more difficult to shift industry employment across
locations.
The estimates obtained in the empirical portion of this paper will reflect the impact
of spillover reflected in city-industry employment, which will incorporate both the
spillover term and the importance of fixed local resources. In further work, it would
be interesting to separate these two factors, which is possible when sufficient data are
available to estimate industry-specific input parameters. However, for city growth the
relevant value is the coefficient that we estimate, which reflects the combination of
the strength of spillovers and the extent to which industry employment can respond
to those spillovers.

Table 12: Industry agglomeration patterns excluding London

This table reports industry agglomeration in each year based on the index from Ellison & Glaeser
(1997). This approach adjusts for the size of plants in an industry using an industry Herfindahl
index. We construct these Herfindahl indices using the firm size data reported in the 1851 Census
and apply the same Herfindahl for all years, since firm-size data are not reported in later Censuses.
Some analysis industries are not included in this table due to lack of firm size data.

Note: We report cross-city summary statistics for 1861-1911 because we only report instrumented cross-city regression results in the main text, which means that 1851 is used
only to construct lagged values. For the others, we report summary statistics using the full
1851-1911 period since we report both OLS and instrumented results.

Main analysis robustness exercises

Figure 4 presents t-statistics for each cross-industry term obtained from running regressions equivalent to column 3 of Table 5, where in each regression a different city is
dropped from the dataset. This allows us to assess the extent to which our results are
robust to changes in the set of cities included in the analysis. These results indicate
that our estimates are not sensitive to dropping individual cities from the analysis
database.

Figure 5 presents t-statistics for each cross-industry term obtained from running
regressions equivalent to column 3 of Table 5, where in each regression a different
industry is dropped from the dataset. This allows us to assess the extent to which
55

our results are robust to changes in the set of industries included in the analysis.
Specifically, while our IOin results are robust to dropping individual industries, we see
that the estimates on the IOout and EMP terms are highly sensitive to the inclusion
of particular industries. These results indicate that our estimates are much more
sensitive to dropping industries than they are to dropping cities. This suggests that
heterogeneity across industries is more important than heterogeneity across cities.

Heterogeneous effects

In this section we look at heterogeneiety in the pattern of cross-industry and withinindustry effects across different industries. We begin by considering heterogeneous
cross-industry effects. Specifically, we can run two alternative versions of Equation 9,
56

4 ln(Lict+1 ) = τ̃ii ln(Lict ) + β i

X

CON N ECTki ln(Lkct ) + θct + φit + eict

(20)

4 ln(Li6=k ct+1 ) = τ̃ii ln(Lict ) + β k CON N ECTki ln(Lkct ) + θct + φit + eict

(21)

k6=i

where CON N ECTki is one of our four measures of cross-industry connections. Equation 20 allows us to estimate industry-specific coefficients β i describing how much
each industry i benefits from cross-industry connections. This specificatoin can be
estimated using the same approach as was used for our baseline regressions. Using Equation 21, we estimate industry-specific coefficients β k that reflect the extent
to which industry k generates spillovers that benefit other industries. Estimating
this value requires a different approach to avoid conflating the within and between
impact of industry k when estimating β k . Specifically, we run separate regressions
corresponding to Equation 21 for each industry k. In each of these regressions, only
employment in industry k (interacted with a cross-industry connection measure) is
included as an explanatory variable and observations from industry k are not included
in the dependent variable.
Once the industry-specific β i and β k terms are estimated, we compare them to
available measures of industry characteristics: firm size in each industry, the share
of output exported, and the share of output sold to households. In each case we
run a simple univariate regression where the dependent variable is the estimated
industry-specific cross-industry spillover coefficient and the independent variable is
one of the industry characteristics.34 These results can provide suggestive evidence
about the characteristics of industries that produce or benefit from different types of
cross-industry spillovers, but because of the small sample size we will not be able to
draw any strong conclusions.
Table 14 describes the characteristics of industries that benefit from cross-industry
connections. In rows 1-2, we see evidence that small firm size in an industry is associated with more cross-industry spillover benefits, but this pattern is not statistically
significant at standard confidence levels. The only strong result coming out of this
34

Univariate regressions are used because we are working with a relatively small number of observations.

57

table is that industries that benefit from connections to other local industries with
similar labor pools tend to have a larger labor cost share relative to overall industry
sales, as well as a smaller intermediate cost share.
Table 15 describes the characteristics of industries that produce cross-industry
connections. These results also suggest that industries with smaller firm sizes produce
more beneficial cross-industry spillovers, but again, these results are not statistically
significant. There is also evidence that industries with a greater labor cost share (and
smaller intermediate cost share) relative to overall sales produce more cross-industry
benefits to other occupationally similar industries.

1851 Census of Population. The share of industry output exported or sold to households is from

the 1907 Census of Manufactures. The intermediate cost share is based on the 1907 input-output

probably due to small-sample bias. We have also explored regressions in which we weight results by
the inverse of the standard error of each estimated within-industry coefficient in order to account
for the precision of those estimates and these deliver similar results.

The dependent variable in each regression is the estimated β k coefficient from the regression in
Equation 21. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The dependent
variables are the estimated cross-industry spillover coefficients for each industry and each spillover
channel. Firm size data comes from the 1851 Census of Population. The share of industry output
exported or sold to households is from the 1907 input-output table. The labor cost share is
constructed from industry wage bills from the 1907 Census of Manufactures. The intermediate
cost share is based on the 1907 input-output table. We do not report robust standard errors
because these generate smaller confidence intervals, probably due to small-sample bias. We have
also explored regressions in which we weight results by the inverse of the standard error of each
estimated within-industry coefficient in order to account for the precision of those estimates and
these deliver similar results.

Next, we undertake a similar exercise with our estimated within-industry coefficients. In Table 16 we consider some of the industry characteristics that may be related to the range of different within-industry spillover estimates we observe. Columns
1-2 focus on the role of firm size using two different measures. We observe a positive relationship between firm size in an industry and the strength of within-industry
spillovers, but this results is not statistically significant

Firm size data comes from the 1851 Census of Population. The export’s and household’s share
of industry output come from the input-output table. Total labor cost and total output values
come from the 1907 Census of Production. Intermediate cost is constructed based on data from
the 1907 Input-Ooutput matrix. We do not report robust standard errors because these generate
smaller confidence intervals, probably due to small-sample bias. We have also explored regressions
in which we weight results by the inverse of the standard error of each estimated within-industry

Further results using alternative connections matrices

This section presents additional results obtained using the alternative connections
matrices introduced in Section 6. Table 17 presents results for regressions including
multiple spillover channels. Columns 1-3 use the twelve aggregated industry categories
available when using the 1841 input-output table. Columns 4-6 use the more limited
set of nine industry categories that are available in our technology similarity matrix.
As in the main results, we observe positive effects occuring through the IOin channel and these results are generally statistically significant. Results obtained for the
IOout and the two labor force similarity channels is clearly sensitive to the underlying
60

set of industries used, while we observe no positive effect associated with the technology similarity matrix. However, we should use caution when interpreting any of
these results because we are working with a small number of industry categories and
correlated measures of cross-industry connections. Comparing these results to those
described in the main text makes it clear that the correlations between the various
spillover channels are having an important influence on the results. This may result
in us observing insignificant or even negative results for channels that are important
but poorly measured, which is a particular concern for the technological similarity
channel.
