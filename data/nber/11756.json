    "abstract": "\n\nThe effective tax rate on equity securities has fluctuated considerably in the U.S. between 1917-2004. This study investigates whether personal taxes on equity securities are related to stock valuations using the time-series variation in tax burdens. The paper finds an economically and statistically significant relationship between asset valuations and personal tax rates. Consistent with tax capitalization, stock valuations tend to be relatively low when tax burdens are relatively high.\n\n",
