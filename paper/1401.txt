The Compliance Cost of the U.S. Individual
Income Tax System

ABSTRACT

This paper uses evidence from a survey of Minnesota taxpayers to
estimate the magnitude and demographic patterns of the compliance cost of
filing federal and state income tax returns. It concludes that in 1982 this
cost was between $ii and $21 billion, or from five to seven percent of the

revenue raised by the federal and state income tax systems combined. About
two billion hours of taxpayer time were spent on filing tax returns, and
about $3 billion was spent on professional tax assistance.

Introduction

Writers on tax matters have long maintained that an ideal tax system
should, ceteris paribus, have minimal administrative and compliance costs.

For example, Adam Smith's fourth canon of taxation states "every tax ought
to be so contrived as to keep out of the pockets of people as little as

possible over and above what it brings into the treasury of the state."
I'lore recently, Musgrave and Musgrave advocated that collection costs "should

be as low as is compatible with other objectives."2 A common theme of
many recent tax reform proposals has been "simplification," one interpretation

of which is to reduce the compliance costs of the system. One problem with
the debate about the appropriateness of tax simplification is that it has been
conducted amid an almost complete absence of quantitative information about
the magnitude and characteristics of the cost of the current system of raising
revenue and the likely collection costs of alternatives to the current system.
This paper uses evidence from a survey of Minnesota taxpayers to estimate
the magnitude and nature of the compliance cost of filing federal and state

individual income tax returns. It concludes that in 1982 this cost was
between $17 and $27 billion, or from five to seven percent of the revenue

raised by the federal and state income tax systems combined. Between 1.8 and
2.1 billion hours of taxpayer time were spent on filing tax returns, and

between $3.0 and $3.4 billion was spent on professional tax assistance. A
companion paper to this study utilizes the data from this survey to derive
predictions of how compliance costs would change as a result of a number of
different modifications of the tax law.3

2

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some earlier
attempts at estimating the compliance costs of the individual income tax.
Section 3 contains a description of the questionnaire and survey procedure.
In Section 4 we discuss some methodological issues that arise in using the

survey evidence to derive compliance cost estimates. The results of the
survey are presented in detail in Section 5, and Section 6 offers some

concluding comments and suggests promising directions for future research
in this area.

The concept of compliance costs refers to all those costs incurred by
taxpayers or by third parties in complying with the requirements of the tax

system, over and above the tax payments themselves.4 In this paper our
atteriition is more narrowly focused only on the costs directly borne by the

taxpayers, and only on measurable components of cost such as time and

pecuniary expenditures. Thus we do not deal with third party costs nor do
we pay much heed to any ftpsychicu costs of filling out tax forms. Furthermore,
we do not distinguish between discretionary costs, which are incurred by
taxpayers in an attempt to reduce their tax liability, and nondiscretionary
costs, which must be spent in order to satisfy the legal filing requirements.
Our impression is that in most cases, if the taxpayer is willing to pay an
unnecessarily high amount of tax, the minimum amount of resources that must

be expended to comply with the law is relatively small. Most of the costs
incurred are then at least to some extent discretionary. What portion of
cost is nondiscretionary is in practice difficult to determine and, in any
event, both kinds of costs are real resource costs of collecting the taxes.

3

One problem with interpreting compliance costs as resource costs of

collection arises when the individual is self—employed. In this case, it
is difficult to separate the tax compliance costs from the standard
accounting and auditing procedures that would be undertaken even in the

absence of a tax system. This is not the same issue as the discretionary
or nondiscretionary problem discussed above. Here the problem is that some
of what is apparently compliance cost has additional value to the firm owner.

In fact, the problem is more generally applicable. If attention to one's
tax return induces a household to better manage its financial affairs, then
some of the time or money spent is not a net cost of the tax collection

process. This survey does not successfully identify what portion of
compliance costs have non—tax related usefulness.

In sum, this paper treats compliance costs of the individual income tax
system borne directly by the taxpayers themselves, including both the time

spent and pecuniary expenditures. This is a major, but not the sole,
component of the system's total collection cost, which also includes the
cost incurred by the government collection agencies and by third parties to
the collection process.

Literature Review
In this section we briefly review the empirical literature on the

compliance cost of individual income taxation. The first quantitative
treatment for the United States seems to be that of Martin (1944), who
estimated that individual compliance costs amounted to 1.2 percent of

federal tax revenues. However, the basis for this calculation is apparently
a series of educated guesses, and this study should be classified as

quantitative but not empirical. Willis (1969) constructed an estimate of
compliance costs by making assumptions about the time requirements for

various kinds of returns, applying these estimates to the known distribution
of returns, and valuing the time based on the tax preparation fees of a

nationwide tax preparation firm. Willis estimated that the compliance costs
for individuals were 2.38 percent of income tax revenues.

The study by Wicks (1966) was the first to be based on survey information.
Wicks distributed questionnaires to 380 of his economics students at the
University of Montana with the request that they mail the questionnaires to

their parents. The questionnaire requested information on the time and money
spent in conjunction with filing federal tax returns, plus information on the
parents' occupations, income, political inclinations, and views on compliance

costs. Wicks recognized that his sampling procedure was subject to bias, so
he adjusted his population estimates to reflect the occupational structure of

the state. He also looked for any indication of response bias by conducting
a telephone survey of nonrespondents. The phone survey revealed that the
nonrespondents believed they had less difficulty with filing their returns

than those who did respond. As a correction for this apparent response bias,
Wicks adjusted his compliance cost average downwards.

5

Wicks concluded that the average Montana taxpayer spent $88 worth of

time and money while complying with the federal income tax. This amounted
to 11.5 percent of the revenue raised. He also observed no relationship
between a household's compliance cost and its tax liability, although the

cost of compliance did vary systematically by occupation. Self-employed
individuals had the highest average costs, while individuals in the

professional, managerial, and sales lines also reported significantly greater
than average compliance costs.

Wicks and Killworth (1967) employed a similar survey methodology to
estimate the compliance costs of the state and local income tax systems in

Montana. They asked people about how much time and money they spent on
filing taxes beyond the time that went to complying with federal income

taxes. They found that the incremental compliance costs amounted to 20.7

percent of the revenue raised by the Montana income tax. This figure is
subject to considerable doubt, however, due to the difficulty in meaningfully
separating the time and money spent on federal tax affairs and that spent on
state income tax affairs. Record—keeping requirements, for example, apply to

both taxes. In addition, fees charged for professional tax assistance are
not as a rule divided into a charge for the federal return and a charge for
the state return; any such division reported by the taxpayer must be
essentially arbitrary.

More recently, the Commission on Federal Paperwork estimated the
compliance cost of the individual income tax system in 1977 to be $4.8

billion, or about three percent of income tax revenues. This figure was
derived from an Internal Revenue Service estimate that 45 percent of
individual returns filed in that year were prepared by commercial return

6

preparers, with an average fee of $27. Assuming the same cost per return for
the other 55 percent implies a total cost of $2.3 billion. This figure,
though, included only the return preparation itself and not any attendant

record-keeping. Making the "conservative' estimate that as much effort is
involved in record—keeping as in reading and understanding the instructions
and filling out the tax form itself, the Commission settled on twice $2.3
billion, or $4.6 billion, as its best estimate.

By far the most careful and exhaustive study of compliance costs to date

is that of Sandford (1973). Unfortunately for our purposes, the object of
investigation was the income tax system of the United Kingdom, which differs

in some critical aspects from that of the United States.5 Sandford and his
research team studied compliance costs by using a survey of professional tax
advisors, a survey of individual taxpayers, and an analysis of tax-related

inquiries to press bureaus and public tax advice clinics. Based on the
survey of individual taxpayers, Sandford estimated that compliance costs

amounted to between 1.87 and 3.39 percent of tax revenue collected. He also
concluded that low income people had, on average, higher compliance costs as
a fraction of income than higher income people.

Because the U.K.'s tax system places less responsibility for calculation
on the taxpayer than does the U.S. system, the compliance cost in the United

States is likely to be higher than that in the United Kingdom. Although his
estimates are at best a lower-bound figure for the United States, much insight
is to be gained from a study of Sandford's work.

The empirical literature to date can be divided neatly into two categories.
Those based on U.S. data are for the most part severely out of date and often

subject to questions about the survey randomness. The most careful study is

7

relatively recent but pertains to the British tax system, which is different
enough in critical ways from the U.S. tax system to make any extrapolation

extremely tenuous. Beginning in the next section of the paper we present
our approach to assessing the magnitude and characteristics of the compliance
cost of individual income taxation in the United States in 1982.

3.

The Survey
Immediately after the deadline for filing 1982 income tax returns

(April 15, 1983), a four—page questionnaire was mailed to an approximately6

random sample of 2000 Minnesota residents. The list of residents' addresses
was supplied by a Minneapolis-based professional name service firm. Accompanying
the questionnaire was a cover letter explaining that the research was being

done in conjunction with the senior thesis project of a college student. An
addressed, stamped envelope was provided for return mailing. The questionnaire
and cover letter are reproduced in an appendix to this paper.

One objective in designing the survey was to maximize the response rate.
Respondents were not required to provide their names in the questionnaire,

and the confidentiality of the information given was assured. Questions
about potentially sensitive information such as age and income were blocked
into ranges so that the respondents did not have to give an exact answer.
Not requiring the respondent to provide exact answers for income or tax
liability also eliminated the necessity of their having to refer to their
tax records, which presumably would be a painful chore for many individuals

the week after the filing deadline. To lend an extra air of serious intent
and authenticity, a University of Minnesota return address was used for
mailing purposes.

-

8

Another design objective was to avoid biased responses. To that end,
the word "compliance" was not used in the cover letter or questionnaire.
Our intent was to avoid any suggestion that we were concerned with illegal,

or noncomplying, behavior. The tone of the survey was that we were interested
in the time and money spent preparing and filing tax returns, and not
interested in to what specific ends the time and money were spent on.

The questionnaire's first section7 asks about some demographic
information, in particular the respondent's sex, age, level of education
completed, income, employment status, occupation, and wage rate or

reservation wage. In assessing this information, it is important to
realize that the cover letter pointedly asks that the addressee refer the
questionnaire to the 'person in [the] household most familiar with filing

[the] income tax returns." Thus the distribution of demographic
characteristics should not be expected to precisely replicate the

population distribution of characteristics. In particular, answers to
questions about sex and education would be expected to be biased if, as
the data indicate, males tend to be more familiar with the returns or, as
is likely, the more educated household member is more familiar with the

filing process. Note that because the demographic characteristics of those
most familiar with tax returns for the nation as a whole is not known, it
is impossible to determine how well the sample represents the nation as a
whole.

The next section of the questionnaire solicits information about the

household's income tax return itself. The taxpayer is asked which, if any,
of the three federal tax returns and which, if either, of the two Minnesota

state tax forms was filed. In addition, we ask about whether the return

9

featured itemized deductions, whether it was a joint return, and which of
several sources of income were received.

The remainder of the questionnaire is devoted to collecting information

about the household's cost of filing tax returns. This section asks how
many hours were spent during the year, and a breakdown of the hours into

various categories. In addition, any money spent on tax assistance or
otherwise spent in filing returns is solicited. A question on the
individual's attitude toward filing returns is included, as is a question
designed to elicit a dollar figure for the value of all time, effort and

money spent on tax affairs. Finally, the taxpayer was asked whether he or
she had ever chosen not to undertake some business activity because of the
hassle or expense of complying with tax laws.

The response rate of the survey was 32.65 percent. Of the 653
questionnaires returned, 41 were from people not required to file 1982

state or federal income tax returns. Most of these people were over the
age of 65 and had not earned enough income to be subject to tax. Twelve
questionnaires were eliminated from the sample because they were very
8

incomplete, leaving 600 usable replies.

10

4.

Some Methodological Issues
Before proceeding to present the results of this survey, we must deal

with two methodological issues that are important to the interpretation of

our findings. They are (1) the possibility that the responding group of
households is not representative of the U.S. population and (2) the problem

of how to value the time spent in filing returns. In this section we
examine each of these issues in turn.

We took great care to ensure that the households to whom questionnaires

were sent comprised a random sample of the households of Minnesota.9 Our

feeling is that this goal was met reasonably well. However, there are good
reasons to suspect that the households who respond to a survey such as this

would not represent a random sample of the population. After all, filling
out a questionnaire is not unlike filling out a tax form, and those people
who have a strong aversion to paperwork are likely not to return our

questionnaire. Another potential factor is the desire of those who are
fed up with the tax system to make their experiences and opinions known; they

may make a special effort to return their questionnaires. As mentioned
above, Wicks was concerned with this kind of bias and conducted a telephone
survey of nonrespondents to determine whether their behavior differed from

that of the respondents. He found that the nonrespondents apparently had
less difficulty with filing their returns than those who did respond.

Due to a resource constraint, no such telephone survey was done in connection
with our survey.

An additional consideration is that Minnesotans may vary in certain ways

from non-Minnesotans. Thus, even if the sample is representative of
Minnesotans, it may fail to be representative of Americans in general.

11

One way to check the representativeness of the sample is to compare its

demographic profile with that of the U.S. as a whole. One problem immediately
arises, however. As mentioned above, the answers to most of the demographic
questions refer to the person in the household most familiar with filing the

income tax returns. Thus, it is not at all clear how to interpret the
distributions by occupation, age, sex, or employment status. Certainly it
is inappropriate if confronted with, say, a male-female distribution that
is different than for the U.S. as a whole to conclude that the sample is

unrepresentative. The divergence between the two distributions could be
simply due to the tendency of either males or females to become more familiar
with the tax return filing process.

The question about income does, however, refer to the total household
income, so the distribution of responses may be fruitfully compared to the

U.S. income distribution. Making such a comparison suggests that the sample
is not in fact representative of the U.S. population. In particular, it
undersamples low-income households (only 8.3 percent of the sample report
income less than $10,000, while 35.4 percent of tax filers in 1982 had
adjusted gross income in this range10) and oversamples high-income households
(21.7 percent in the sample report income over $40,000, while only 10.7 percent

of taxpayers in 1982 had at least this much income). This discrepancy is
certainly large enough to be concerned that the sample averages are biased

measures of the national average. Of course, this problem arises only to the
extent that compliance behavior varies systematically with income. Because
we find that behavior does in fact vary with income, all the population
averages we report are calculated by reweighting the sample to represent the
U.S. adjusted gross income distribution in 1982.11

12

it is also apparent that our sample overrepresents the presence of

relatively complicated tax returns. This is true even for given income
classes. Because households with more complicated returns are likely to
have higher compliance costs, reweighting the sample only on the basis of
income is likely to lead to an overestimate of the true resource cost.

Therefore the sample is reweighted to reproduce not only the U.S. distribution
of adjusted gross income, but also the correct aggregate proportion of returns

with itemized deductions for each income class. Itemization status is chosen
as the reweighting factor in an attempt to proxy for the degree of complication

of a tax return. Alternative reweighting factors (such as the usage of 1040A
and 1O4OEZ federal tax forms) were also considered, but no significant

differences from the results reported here emerged. Weighting by income and
itemization status is quite successful in producing a distribution of other
return characteristics which is similar to that of the U.S. taxpaying
population.

12

Note, however, that this procedure only adjusts for differences between
the sample and the U.S. population that are correlated with income and

itemization status. Therefore it may miss differences due to, for example,
occupation structure that are uncorrelated with these factors or uncorrelated

differences in attitudes toward tax filing. In addition, this procedure does
not fully take account of the fact that the Minnesota state income tax return

is undoubtedly more complex than the average state income tax return. This
extraordinary complexity lends bias of unknown magnitude to the results we

present. In the final section of this paper we discuss the possible net
effect of these and other sources of error.

13

As we will show later, the largest component of compliance costs is

the time spent by the taxpayers themselves. In this study we are interested
not only in the nunther of hours expended but also in the resource cost, in

dollars, of this time. Thus we require some procedure for valuing taxpayers'
time.

If the time spent came at the expense of extra work, then under certain
conditions the appropriate social valuation is the gross hourly compensation

earned by the individual. This valuation is valid in the absence of
imperfections in the labor market and requires the assumption that
individuals are indifferent between working and spending time on their

tax affairs. Insofar as people prefer, say, working at their job to working
on their taxes, the valuation of the latter needs to be increased accordingly.
This procedure also implicitly assumes that the time used in completing one's

tax forms is totally unproductive for any other purpose. It is not, though,
unreasonable to suppose that for some people an annual account of their
financial affairs may have some positive value.

We feel that it is more reasonable to assume that the time spent on

tax affairs comes at the expense of leisure rather than work. This implies
that in a perfect labor market the value of the time spent is appropriately
measured as the rate of compensation after taxes, rather than before taxes

as above. This valuation, though, is equally subject to the criticism that
it ignores any differential between the marginal utility (or disutility) of
working per se and the marginal utility (or disutility) of doing one's tax

affairs.13 The survey solicited the rate of compensation after taxes, so
this is available for most taxpayers.

(More will be said later about the

problems that arise for those taxpayers for whom the wage is not available.)

14

However, nothing is known about individuals' valuation of the marginal

utility of work effort or of tax filing. Thus the appropriate correction
to the net wage rate is unknown. This indeterminacy has led most
investigators in the field of transportation, who are interested in the

valuation of travel time, to ignore the conceptual link with the labor

market and to seek direct market evaluations of leisure time itself. Most
of these studies have found the value of time to be between 15 and 50 percent
of the average wage rate for the group.14 This of course does not include any

adjustment for the probable disutility of time spent on tax matters. Judging
by the responses to our question about attitudes to tax filing, this may not

be insignificant. Of those surveyed, only 1.4 percent said they "very much"
enjoyed preparing and filing their income tax returns and 7.7 percent said
they enjoyed the process; 36.9 percent replied that they neither enjoyed nor

disliked it. On the other hand, 28.6 percent of those surveyed said they
disliked the process and 23.8 percent said they disliked it "very much."15
One survey question was designed specifically to induce the respondent
to supply us with the exact compensating variation for the time spent on tax

filing. We asked
If you could have avoided all the time and effort on your
1982 income tax returns, how much more would you have
been willing to pay? (Assume the amount of income tax
paid would not have changed.)
Unfortunately, the concept of compensating variation was not successfully

conveyed by this question. Respondents often answered $0, and some
volunteered that they wouldn't pay a penny more than they already had paid.

Many gave no answer at all. Clearly this method did not yield a reliable
indication of the value of compliance time. This lack of success brings us
back to the wage rate as the basis of our estimate of the value of time.

15

Information about wage rate and reservation wage was solicited in a

two-tiered question. First, the individual was asked whether he/she could
increase his/her income by choosing to work more hours. If the answer was
yes, then the survey asked how much before taxes would be received for

working an additional hour. If the answer was no, the survey asked how
much the respondent would want to be paid if he/she could work extra hours.
The goal of these questions was in the former case to determine the
appropriate wage rate at the margin, and in the latter case to determine
the reservation wage.

Our impression from looking at the questionnaire responses was that

those who answered this question interpreted it correctly. However, many
of the answers were unusable. For example, some people wrote "time—and-a—

half," "retired," or "variable." Others left the answer space completely
blank. Unusable replies comprised 46 percent of all cases.
Because we did not want to eliminate such a large subsample from our
investigation, a procedure for imputing the value of time was employed.

There is a substantial literature, based on the theory of labor supply,
concerned with imputing wage rates to nonworking women based on their
characteristics, plus the wage rates and characteristics of working women.
However, direct application of that methodology to the problem at hand
seems inappropriate because there is no clear distinction between those
for whom a wage rate or reservation wage is available and those for whom

it is not available. Thus we cannot, for example, posit that the reservation
wage of those with no wage rate available (because they are not working)

must be greater than the wage rate that could be earned. A respondent with no

16

wage rate available may indeed be working but happened to provide an unusable
response to this question.

The procedure we have chosen treats the problem as a straightforward
case of missing values and imposes no restrictive theoretical structure.
Based on those in the sample who provided a usable response to this question,

we estimate an equation for the wage rate or reservation wage as a function
of the available demographic variables, including income bracket, employment
status, occupation, age, level of education completed, marital status, and

sex. This equation is then used to impute a value for wage rate or
reservation wage for those respondents with unusable replies tothis
question. The final step is to convert these values for before—tax wage
into the appropriate after-tax concepts. This is done by estimating the
combined federal and Minnesota marginal tax rate on labor income from the

stated income bracket and marital status. This procedure requires us to
make assumptions about the amount of

deductions and exemptions taken.

In summary, our measure of the value of time is stated or estimated
after—tax

wage rates or, if

additional

work is unavailable, the after—tax

reservation wage. The reader should keep in mind that this valuation
procedure ignores the problem that working hours may not be freely variable
and, more importantly, assumes that the marginal disutility from working is
approximately equal to the marginal disutility from preparing tax returns.
Because the dollar valuation of time spent on compliance is inexact, in all
our results we report both the raw number of hours spent as well as the
valuation of this time.

Results
On average, respondents to this survey spent 26.7 hours of their own

time on tax filing, which had a resource cost of $318, and spent $61 on

professional tax advice and other outlays. Thus, the average total cost
amounted to $379 per household. When the sample was reweighted to more
closely represent the actual U.S. taxpaying population, the average

compliance time comes to 21.7 hours, valued at $231, and $44 in additional

expenses, for a total of $275 per household. Applying the reweighted
averages to an estimated 97 million taxpaying units in 1982 yields aggregate
estimates of 2.13 billion hours and a total resource cost of $26.7 billion.

This cost is approximately 1.4 percent of aggregate adjusted gross income,
and more than seven percent of total federal and state income tax revenue.
Nearly two—thirds of the time spent on filing was devoted to recordkeeping, with actual preparation of the return accounting for about one—

fifth, and research about one-tenth of total time.16 Slightly less than
half of all households (45.9%) hired professional tax assistance.'7 Of

those who used assistance, the average payment was $76. Table 1 shows the
distribution of time spent and expenditures on professional tax assistance.
About three—quarters of the households spent less than 20 hours on tax
matters, and a similar fraction spent less than $50 for tax assistance.
However, over 13 percent of households spent at least 50 hours on tax
compliance, and 13 percent spent more than $100.
Table 2 details the relationship between compliance cost and income.
One surprising feature of this table is the large amount of time spent by

the lowest income group. This is not the result of one respondent claiming

an implausibly high value of time spent, but rather several high answers.

However, there are only 15 respondents in this category, so the results must

be treated with some caution. One conceivable explanation for this finding
is that these households are in occupations which have high income variability
(e.g., farming or other self-employment) which also have large record-keeping

requirements, and experienced temporarily low income in 1982, although their

permanent income is not low. Another possible factor is that the commitment
of a large amount of time itself contributed to a low value for taxable
income, due to the discovery of various tax reduction schemes.

Overall, the distribution of own time spent with respect to income is

U—shaped. This relationship is more striking when the value of time is
considered, because the average valuation per hour of time is highest for
the top income class, and lowest for the $10,000 to $20,000 households.' Note
that the average value of time for the lowest income class is similar to the
value of time in the $20,000 to $50,000 range and greater than the value in
the $lO,000—$20,000 income groups, thus reinforcing our presumption that some

of these households are only temporarily earning low income. The allocation
of time spent among the various categories is relatively constant among income
groups, research and record—keeping are relatively more important for the
higher (and, again, lowest) income groups, and actual preparation time is

relatively more important for the $5,000—$20,000 income households.18 The
fraction of households who pay for professional assistance generally increases

with income, rising from about 35 percent for the lowest two classes, about
50 percent for the middle income groups, up to 78 percent for those households

earning more than $50,000 of income. Except for the lowest two classes, the
average amount spent by those who do use assistance rises as well, peaking
at nearly $200 for the highest income class.

21

The total resource cost of compliance has a U—shaped relationship with

income. For households with over $50,000 income, the average resource cost
exceeds $1,400. As a percentage of tax liability, though, there is no obvious
pattern except the high percentage for the lowest two income groups. Measured
as a percentage of income, the cost for the highest group (1.7%) is
significantly higher than for any of the other groups except the lowest two.

It is useful to keep in mind the distinction between the social cost of

compliance and the privately borne cost. Our assumption that compliance time
comes at the expense of leisure implies that social and private cost are

equal. However, for monetary expenditures this equivalence is not valid due
to the deductibility of these expenses. For itemizing households, the
privately borne costs of expenditure on tax preparation are below the social

cost by a fraction equal to the marginal tax rate. Because both the extent
of itemization and the marginal tax rate tend to rise with income, the
private cost of compliance is more regressive than Table 2 suggests.
In Table 3 we present some data on the relationship between compliance

cost and educational attainment. The table indicates the more educated
taxpayer tends to spend more time on his tax affairs and is less likely to

purchase professioral tax advice. In the lowest educational attainment
group, over 55 percent of households paid for assistance, compared to less
than 50 percent for college graduates and less than 40 percent for those

with a graduate level education. However, the average amount spent by those
who did pay for assistance rises monotonically from about $50 for the lowest
group to over $120 for the highest group.

The total resource cost of compliance generally increases with

educational attainment, both due to the increasing number of hours and the

higher average valuation of an hour for more educated households. As a
percentage of income or tax liability, though, the compliance cost is highest
for high school graduates and those with some college.
Table 4 shows the relationship between compliance cost and the age, sex,

and employment status of the person in the household most familiar with the

tax return. Total time spent on compliance, and its resource cost, first
rises then falls with age. This is also true for its major component,
record—keeping, although time spent learning about the tax law rises with

age. In contrast, the fraction of households that hire professional tax
assistance is significantly higher for the two older groups (over 50 percent)

than for the two younger groups (slightly more than 40 percent). Whether
this represents an unwillingness to hassle with tax matters on the part of
older taxpayers or more complicated tax returns is impossible to say without

further analysis. In any event, the ratio of expenditures on professional
tax assistance to hours of own time spent rises monotonically from 1.32 for

the youngest group to 1.99 for the oldest group. The total resource cost
of compliance also has an inverted U-shaped relationship to age, even if
measured as a percentage of income or income tax liability.
Most categories of compliance cost are on average higher for households

where the person most familiar with the return is male. In many cases,
though, the difference is not significant. The total resource cost is
significantly higher for those households where the male is more familiar
with the return.

One shortcoming of drawing conclusions about the nature of compliance
costs on the basis of the patterns observed in Tables 2, 3, and 4 is that
they do not account for potential interrelationships among the variables.

For example, the apparent positive relationship between education and time
spent on compliance may be due to an actual association between income and
compliance time plus a correlation between income and educational attainment.

In other words, households of the same income with different levels of

education

may have no tendency to behave differently. In order to investigate

the relationship between compliance behavior and any demographic variable,
holding

all other variables constant, we utilize an ordinary least—squares

regression analysis with dummy independent variables which take the value
of one for households which fall into the particular class, and take the

value of zero otherwise. Dummy variables for income, educational attainment,
age, sex, employment status, and marital status are included. Table 5

presents the regression results. For each demographic category, the omitted
dummy variable corresponds to the most commonly observed class in the

unweighted sample. Thus, the coefficients listed in Table 5 represent the
impact relative to the impact of being in the most populous category. For
example, a household in the more than $50,000 income class on average spends

6.4 more hours on compliance than does a household in the $20,000—$30,000
class. The reference group for educational attainment is some college or
technical school, for sex is male, for employment status is employed, for
age is 31 to 45 years old, and for marital status is married.

(1) Standard errors in parentheses.
(2) Asterisk indicates that the coefficient is significant at the
95% confidence level.
(3) All coefficients should be interpreted as the partial effect of
being in the given category compared to being in the reference
group. The reference group for income is $20,001 to $30,000,
for education is some college or technical school, for sex is
male, for employment status is employed, for age is 31-45 years
old, and for marital status is married.

27

We look first at the partial effect of income. The simple relationships
observed in Table 2 generally remain when other demographic variables are

held constant. Being in the lowest income class is associated with relatively
high compliance cost, as is being in the highest income class. The
predominantly positive simple relationship between compliance costs and
educational attainment does not strongly appear in the regression analysis.

The magnitude of the extra costs incurred by the most educated is smaller
than those observed in Table 3 and the estimates are for the most part not

statistically significant. We can conclude that most of the observed
difference in costs can be better explained by differences in income or
employment status.

The inverted U-shape of the age-compliance cost relationship noted in
Table 4 also does not come through strongly in the regression analysis.
The primary difference is that, holding other factors equal, the elderly

do not in fact incur less cost in filing tax returns. Although the
estimates are not very strong, the elderly appear to spend slightly more
time and purchase substantially more professional assistance than those

aged 31 to 45. However, the elderly who are also retired spend essentially
the same amount of time, spend only slightly more money, and have a relatively
low total resource cost of compliance.

The sex of the person most familiar with the filing process does not
have a strong partial relationship with any component of compliance cost.
The strong relationship between self-employment and compliance costs does,

though, clearly show up in the analysis. Holding other demographic factors
equal, the self-employed spend 35 more hours, spend 69 more dollars, and

have over $400 more in total resource cost than the reference group of
employees.

28

These regression analyses are not meant to be exhaustive studies of the

determinants of taxpayer compliance behavior. They do not consider potentially
important influences such as the variety of income sources, the opportunity

cost of the taxpayer's time, or the marginal tax rate. Instead, they are
presented as an aid to understanding the demographic patterns of compliance

cost, an important issue in its own right. A comprehensive econometric
analysis of compliance behavior, including a theoretical model of its
determinants, is developed in Slemrod (1983)

6.

Conclusion

This concluding section has two parts. First, we assess the possible
sources of error in the aggregate compliance cost estimates derived from
this survey in order to establish confidence intervals for these predictions.
Second, we look at those areas where additional research is needed.

The sample of survey respondents was reweighted in order to represent
the 1982 U.S. distribution of income and the distribution of relatively

complicated returns. However, the surprisingly high average compliance
cost of the lowest income group arouses the suspicion that these figures

still do not accurately reflect the low—income taxpaying population. In
order to assess the potential importance of this inaccuracy, we have
calculated the aggregate compliance cost under the assumption that the

average compliance cost of the lowest group is not in fact $327 as
calculated, but rather $70, the lowest average cost of any income group
in the sample, and similarly that the correct average amount of time is
9.5 hours and the correct average expenditure on professional assistance

is $18. If these adjustments are made, the aggregate estimates become

29

1.76 billion hours, $2.98 billion spent on professional tax assistance, and
a total resource cost of $21.7 billion, down from $26.7 billion.

Another potential source of bias is any difference between the behavior
of respondents and nonrespondents that is uncorrelated with income or

itemization status. Though some difference is likely to exist, the direction
of bias is uncertain and so this consideration must remain as a caveat to be
attached to the results of this survey.

A final uncorrected cause of bias is the fact that the Minnesota state
income tax return is, by all accounts, more complicated than the average

state tax return. The extraordinary complication probably increases the
average amount of compliance and may also increase the proportion of

taxpayers who use professional tax assistance. The magnitude of this
bias is impossible to determine, though our intuition suggests that it
leads to at most an overestimate of 20 percent of total compliance time
and resource costs.

This brief review of the potential sources of bias in our results
suggests that it is more likely that our figures are on the high side than

on the low side of the truth. There is also considerable arbitrariness in
our procedure for valuing the time spent in compliance. All things
considered, our best estimate is that the time spent on compliance in 1982
was between 1.4 and 2.1 billion hours and that the total resource cost of
compliance was between 17 and 27 billion dollars.

19

30

The promising directions for future research follow directly from the

discussion about the possible bias of the results presented here. Survey
evidence from other states is needed, and in particular evidence that is
not subject to mail response bias or undercoverage of lower income groups.
The uncertainty surrounding the nuirtbers presented here would be substantially

reduced if these areas were addressed in future work. In addition, any
information about the dollar value that individuals themselves place on
time spent on tax matters would allow a more meaningful valuation of the
resource cost of compliance.

The compliance costs measured in this paper are only one part of the

total collection cost of the income tax system. To complete the picture
we would want to estimate the costs incurred by the federal and state
collection agencies and third parties to the collection process.

At least as important as an understanding of the magnitude of collection
costs is an understanding of how these collection costs could be expected to

change as a result of changes in the tax law itself. The collection cost
impact of a proposed policy should be considered along with its effects on

efficiency and the distribution of welfare. Because this survey collected
data on the characteristics of the household's tax return in addition to
the demographic information discussed here, it has promise of yielding
quantitative insight into the compliance cost impact of changes in our
system of collecting tax revenue.

4. Compliance costs are also to be considered separately from the standard
efficiency costs of taxation that arise due to allocational distortions.
5. For example, the majority of taxpayers in the United Kingdom are only
required to fill in an income tax form one year in three.
6. The name service that provided the list asserted that the sampling was
in fact random, but we were not given the opportunity to carefully check
its procedures. See footnote 9.
7. The actual ordering of the questions does not exactly correspond to the
discussion in the text.
8. Four of the 12 incomplete questionnaires were returned without a single
question answered. Four others did not have any information about the
time and/or money spent on filing tax returns. One questionnaire was
incomplete because the taxpayer had filed an extension; one checked the
box for age over 65 and did not complete the rest because of arthritis;
one was partially filled out by the husband even though he wrote that
his wife was an accountant and prepared their tax returns, thus violating
the explicit instructions of the cover letter and questionnaire. The
twelfth unusable (and unusual) questionnaire had checks in nearly every
box, an hourly wage rate of $250,000 and $500,000, and "you are a jerk"
written on the final page.

9. The professional name service firm that supplied the list of names and
addresses maintains a continually updated file of addresses derived from
telephone lists, voting records, and other sources.
10. The figures on the actual distribution of adjusted gross income in 1982
referred to here are based on an extrapolation of the published
distribution in 1980 and 1981.
11. This procedure ignores the distinct possibility that the income concept
to which the respondents were referring in their answer is not identical
to adjusted gross income. However, no obviously superior alternative
is apparent.

12. For example, the percentage of taxpayers in the reweighted sample
receiving various sources of income in most cases closely matches the
U.S. percentages in 1981. Table F—i indicates that the similarity is
excellent for capital gains, rental income, and dividends and less
accurate for interest and pension and annuity income.

13. Another implicit assumption is that the choice of how many hours to work
is a marginal calculation and freely variable, which is true for some
individuals but not others.
14. See, for example, Gwilliam and Mackie (1975).

15. These figures refer to the unweighted sample. For the weighted sample,
the percentages are as follows: like very much, 1.2%; enjoy, 9.9%;
neither enjoy nor dislike, 39.7%; dislike, 32.2%; and dislike very much,
16. 9%.

16. Note that this breakdown of time spent implies that the compliance cost
estimate of the Commission on Federal Paperwork, which was based on the
assumption that the time spent in filling out the tax form comprised
half the total time spent (compared to only 20 percent estimated here),
is a substantial underestimate.
17. This figure is consistent with the fact that 40.1% of federal returns
in 1982 were co—signed by a professional tax advisor. (This number is
reported in Riley, 1983, p. 45.)

33

18. The category of "preparation time" in Tables 2, 3, and 4 corresponds to
the sum of the time reported for preparation and 'time spent looking up
tax tables for. . .tax deductions and tax liability." It was felt that
any distinction between these two activities is essentially arbitrary.
The observant reader will note that in Tables 2, 3, and 4 the sum
of the components of time spent often exceeds the figure for total time
spent. This is possible because the survey first asked about each
separate component of compliance, and then for a total time figure, and
did not alert the reader to any adding—up constraint. In most cases
when a discrepancy existed, the sum of the component exceeded the stated
total. Our interpretation of this phenomenon is that the categories of
compliance were perceived to be exhaustive but overlapping. As our
measure of total time spent, we use the stated total rather than the
sum of the components. This figure is also used in the calculation of
the resource cost of time.

19. The lower bounds for these ranges was obtained by first eliminating the
impact of the lowest income group as done in the text, and then further
reducing the numbers by 20 percent to account for the maximum bias
imparted by the special difficulty of the Minnesota state income tax
filing process. The upper bounds are the weighted figures from the
survey.

APPENDIX

April 15, 1983

Dear Minnesota Resident:

I am an Economics student in the Honors Division of the University of
Minnesota studying the costs of filing individual income tax returns for my

senior thesis. The costs to taxpayers of filing income tax returns can be divided
into several areas: the money paid for professional tax assistance and advice,
the time spent keeping records and preparing tax returns, and even the worry

and frustration that people experience because of income taxation. These costs
of filing tax returns are above and beyond the amount of income tax paid.

In the last several years, there has been much talk about the complexity of

our income tax system and the amount of difficulty people have in filing tax

returns. To study this area of income taxation for my senior thesis, I have sent
the enclosed questionnaire to a group of Minnesota residents requesting information

on their costs of filing tax returns. Your household has been randomly chosen
to participate in this survey. I would be very grateful if the person in your
household most familiar with filing your income tax returns would spend a few
minutes completing this survey and then mail it in the postage—paid envelope at
their earliest convenience.

Your participation in this survey is completely voluntary. However, your
experiences with filing tax returns are very important to my research, and
I hope you will share the information I need to study these hidden costs of

taxation. Information found on your questionnaire will be completely confidential.
In fact, when the surveys are returned, I will not be able to match the names

of Minnesota residents with their completed questionnaires. Thank you very
much for your help.
