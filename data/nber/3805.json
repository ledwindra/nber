    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper summarizes a forthcoming book that describes issues and recent innovations in the measurement of international transactions. A number of distinguished authors assess data measuring trade in merchandise, services, and foreign-direct investment claims. Others assess international prices and data measuring comparisons of inputs and outputs internationally. (International financial data are not assessed.) The chapters in many cases tabulate the data and illustrate their application to recent research questions. U.S. international data are emphasized, but those of other countries are frequently highlighted as well. Growing international interdependence and structural and technological change raise a number of important theoretical and measurement issues that are explored here with regard, for example, to computer prices, productivity, international convergence of income, service provision from overseas affiliates, and proper valuation of direct investment stakes.\n\n",
