Interracial Workplace Cooperation: Evidence from the NBA

NBER Working Paper No. 14749
February 2009
JEL No. J15,J71,L23
ABSTRACT
Using data from the National Basketball Association (NBA), we examine whether patterns of workplace
cooperation occur disproportionately among workers of the same race. We find that, holding constant
the composition of teammates on the floor, basketball players are no more likely to complete an assist
to a player of the same race than a player of a different race. Our confidence interval allows us to
reject even small amounts of same-race bias in passing patterns. Our findings suggest that high levels
of interracial cooperation can occur in a setting where workers are operating in a highly visible setting
with strong incentives to behave efficiently.

Introduction
Recent research shows that when individuals are forced to make quick decisions,
they often exhibit same-race preferences, even if they are unwilling to admit to biased
racial attitudes. For example, Price and Wolfers (2007) show that NBA referees are more
likely to call fouls against players of a different race than players of their own race and
Parsons et al. (2008) find that umpires are more likely to call strikes for pitchers of their
own race. Similarly, Antonovics and Knight (2005) find that police are less likely to
search the vehicle of someone of their own race and Donohue and Levitt (2001) find that
an increase in the number of police of a certain race is associated with an increase in
arrests of people of the other race.
This same-race bias could play an important role in collaboration among
colleagues in a workplace. For example, managers might be more likely to give
favorable assignments to same-race employees. Alternatively, colleagues may depend
disproportionately on same-race colleagues for advice or help. Collectively, such
decisions may reduce the workplace productivity and satisfaction of employees of a
minority race. These decisions may play a role in explaining the extent of workplace
segregation (Hellerstein and Neumark 2008). Furthermore, this bias would undermine
the argument that productivity is higher in groups that are ethnically diverse (Page 2007).
In this paper, we examine the effects of group heterogeneity on teamwork by
studying specific and measurable actions within teams. In traditional firm-level data, it is
often difficult to obtain measures of cooperation. As a result, we use play-by-play data
from the National Basketball Association (NBA). These data allow us to determine for
each basket completed who passed the ball and which other players were on the court at

1

the time. We develop a simple model which allows the optimal pass to depend on the
particular combination of teammates on the floor. We then test whether the pattern of
observed assists demonstrates evidence of same-race bias.
We find no evidence that, conditional on the set of teammates on the court,
players are more likely to pass to a teammates of their same race. Our baseline empirical
strategy controls non-parametrically for the joint distribution of shot quality for all
teammates on the floor. In other words, we account for differences in ability across
teammates. Furthermore, the shooting opportunities of one teammate are allowed to
depend arbitrarily on the set of other teammates on the floor. Robustness checks, in
which we reduce the flexibility of our empirical specification to increase statistical
precision, yield the same substantive results. Our evidence suggests that in workplaces
where employees have common goals and extensive experience working with each other,
cross-race cooperation may not be a problem.

Similarity and Cooperation
There is considerable research, both empirical and theoretical, indicating that
diversity can lead to improved economic outcomes (Alesina and La Ferrera 2005; Hong
and Page 2004; Alesina, Spolaore, and Wacziarg 2000). These gains from diversity
depend on the various groups being willing to cooperate. This may explain why other
studies have found that increased racial diversity is associated with lower group
performance (Kurtulus 2008; Timmerman 2000). In this paper, we expand the literature
on the effects of group heterogeneity on outcomes by studying specific and measurable
actions within teams.

Our analysis of cooperation is one form of own-race bias that has been
documented in other types of interaction including referee-player (Price and Wolfers
2007; Parsons et al. 2008), employer-employee (Stoll, Raphael, and Holzer 2004) and
officer-offender (Antonovics and Knight 2004, Donohue and Levitt 2001). What
distinguishes cooperation from these other settings is that players are working together
towards a common objective, while these other settings involve a more adversarial
relationship. In addition, there is research showing that the racial composition of one’s
group affects decisions similar to cooperation, such as willingness to provide a public
good (Martinez-Vazquez, Rider, and Walker 1997), form a coalition (Brasington 1999),
or increase welfare spending (Luttmer 2001).

NBA Data
Our analysis draws on play-by-play data that we collected from espn.com for all
regular season and playoff games during October 2002-June 2008. The data includes an
entry for every occurrence during the game that might be important for compiling gamelevel statistics. For each shot that is completed on the court, the data provide the name of
the person who shot the basket and the person who was awarded with an assist, if the shot
was assisted (58.9% are). Using times of substitutions in the data, we apply recursive
methods to determine the ten players on court at any given time.
Thus, for each assisted shot we know who the passer was and the set of four
players would have been available to receive the pass. For each of these players we
merge in information about their race, position, and other characteristics. The player’s
race information comes from data collected by Kahn and Shah (2005), Price and Wolfers

3

(2007) and our own coding from more recent online photos of the players. Our racial
coding is based on a simple measure of “black” or “not-black.”
Table 1 shows summary statistics from our sample. White players completed
36.7 percent of the shots and 20.3 percent of the passes in our sample. 1 Separating the
probability that the shooter is white based on the race of the passer (as done in columns 2
and 3) provides an initial estimate of racial gaps in passing. A white passer is 3.89
percentage points more likely to complete an assist to a white shooter than is a black
passer (the t-statistic for this difference is 12.4). This simple estimate fails to capture any
clumping of white players on the same team (or on the court together) or differences in
the positions they play.
As additional controls for our analysis, we include information about the passer’s
position, how many years he has been on the current team, whether or not the pass occur
during the fourth quarter of a game in which one of the teams is ahead by more than 15
points at the start of the fourth quarter (a blowout game), and whether or not the pass
occurs at a time in the fourth quarter when in which one of the teams is ahead by no more
than 4 points (a close game).
As part of our empirical strategy, we construct identifiers for each unique group
of four players available to receive a pass on a particular play. We limit our analysis to
passing opportunities in which there was at least one player of each race available to
receive the pass. This eliminates about 48.1% of our observations for situations in which
the four players available to receive the pass are black and another 4.36% of our

1

These are an overestimate of the actual fraction of passes and shots made by white players because our
sample is limited to observations in which there was at least one player of each race available to receive the
pass. Without this restriction, white players would make 21.2% of the shots which is roughly in line with
their representative in the NBA.

observations when those four players are white. Including these observations in our
sample would bias our estimates of own-race discrimination towards zero, since the
passer in these situations has no choice regarding the race of the player he can pass to.

Model and Empirical Strategy
Before progressing to our empirical specification and findings, it is helpful to
outline a simple economic model of cooperation. Basketball involves complex offensive
and defensive strategies. For this reason, we define a simpler game that will highlight the
intuition involved and suggest an empirical strategy for identifying possible same-race
bias in passing patterns.
Consider a game with five players. One of the five players is initially endowed
with the ball. The player then passes the ball to one of the four remaining players with
the best shot at the basket. We define S as the set of four players available for the pass.
Player i ∈ S has an opportunity for shot, the quality of which is given by μi . Player
j ∈ S is another player in the passer’s choice set with shot quality μ j . We do not

assume that μi and μ j are independent or identically distributed. We do, however,
assume that both are independent of the player passing the ball. We assume that the
player with the ball passes to his teammate with the highest quality shot. Given these

5

assumptions, the probability that the player with the ball passes to player i given the set
of available passing options, S, can be written θ i ,S = prob ( μi > μ j ∀j ≠ i ∈ S ) . 2
This simple model suggests a tractable empirical specification to test the role of
race in on-the-job cooperation. We can estimate the following linear probability model:

= θ w,S + β1assister
+εp ,

Where 1Sscorer
is an indicator variable that takes on a value of 1 if the player scoring
,p

the basket is white, given the set of available scorers S, during possession p. θ w,S is
estimated by a set of dummy variables for every combination of four players available to
receive the assist. This controls non-parametrically for the probability that a white player
has the best shot, taking into account the joint distribution of shot quality among all
players eligible for a pass. Thus, θ w,S accounts both for the talent of every player
available for a pass, as well as how the players interact while on the floor together.
= white
1assister
takes one a value of 1 if the player making the assist is white and ε p is the

residual.
Identification arises from the fact that both a white and a black player choose
among the same set of teammates when passing the ball. If white and black passers are
solving the same optimization problem with the same constraints, β should be
statistically insignificant from zero. A non-zero coefficient suggests that the race of the

passer and potential scorers affects the pattern of assists and hence on-the-job
cooperation.
The disadvantage of our preferred approach is that it consumes literally tens of
thousands of degrees of freedom since we include separate fixed effects for sets of
players that differ only by a single role-player. In doing so, we discard large amounts of
potentially useful information. To the extent that we can approximate θ w,S without the
inclusion of so many dummy variables, we will increase the precision of the estimated
same-race bias.
To do so, we calculate the fraction of assisted baskets scored by a player while on
the floor, excluding baskets in which that player made the assist. This is calculated
separately for each season. For player i, we denote this probability πˆi . One potential
proxy for θ w,S is given by:
(2)

1
θˆwproxy
=
,S

∑

i∈W ∩ S

πˆi ,

where W is the set of white players and S is the set of potential pass recipients on the
court. While this measure is simple, it fails to take into account any interactions between
players on the court. A symptom of this is that even if all potential pass recipients were
white, the measure would almost certainly be above or below one.
For this reason, we construct a second proxy by normalizing this measure by the
propensity of all players in the choice set to score off an assist. Our second proxy is
given by:

θˆwproxy

7

This has the advantage that if all potential pass recipients were white, the measure is
constrained to equal one. It also takes into account that a player’s probability of scoring
depends on the skill of the other teammates on the floor. It fails to take into account,
however, all of the possible idiosyncratic interactions between teammates the way our
preferred approach does.
Using the second of these two proxies, we supplement our primary findings by
estimating linear probability models of the following form 3 .
(4)

= white
2
= white
1scorer
= α 0 + α1θ wproxy
+ β1assister
+εp
S, p
,S
S, p

If our proxy performs well, we would expect our estimate of α1 to be close to one.
Under the null hypothesis of no same-race bias, we would still expect β to be close to
zero. 4
One concern with all specifications is that we have data on only completed assists.
Thus, we cannot determine passes that were made that did not lead to shots and potential
assists that were not converted. While these possibilities could affect the apparent
magnitude of same-race bias, they do not affect the sign of the coefficient. Suppose a
player systematically passes to teammates of his own race, even though they have worse
shots than teammates of another race. In this case, assists between players of the same
race will be relatively more common than assists between players of differing races. This
difference in assists will be less than the difference in attempted assists, however,
because passes made for race-based reasons will be less likely to lead to converted

3

We also estimate all of regressions using logit (table 3) and conditional logit (table 2) regressions. The
marginal effects and standard errors are nearly identical to those using linear probabilitiy models.
4
In all specifications, we cluster correct the standard errors at the team level. This takes into account that
passing decisions may not be independent across assist opportunities. For example, a particular player may
consistently look to pass to a certain teammate for reasons independent of the race of the two players.

baskets. When players choose to score alone or make a pass to a teammate out of
position to score instead of assisting to a teammate of a differing race, this also increases
the relative frequency of same-race assists. Thus data limitations may affect the
magnitude of the observed same-race bias, but our procedure still provides a valid test for
the existence of same-race passing preferences.

Findings
Table 2 shows the results from our empirical examination using our baseline
method. The first column shows our baseline specification with fixed effects for each of
the four player combinations but no additional covariates. We find that the probability
that the shooter is white increases by 0.97 percentage points relative to a baseline
probability of 36.7 percentage points (or a 2.6% increase) and is not statistically
significant. Even at the upper end of the 95% confidence interval, a white passer is only
2.5 percentage points more likely to pass to a white teammate than a black passer. 5
In the second column, we include additional controls for the position of the
passer. This addresses the concern that differences in the position mix between black and
white players may lead to differences in passing patterns that are unrelated to preferences.
The resulting coefficients are virtually identical to the baseline estimates.
In the third column, we interact the race of the passer with a dummy variable
indicating whether or not the passer is in his first year on the team. This tests the
5

While we find no effect of same-race bias in passing patterns, an apparent effect would not necessarily
indicate on-court animus. Instead, a high incidence of within race passing might indicate familiarity
between players of the same race. In other words, a white player might be happy to make a pass to a black
player in position to score but instead passes to a white teammate because he knows better where that
teammate will be on the floor. In this case, race-based social investments off the court translate into low
levels of cross-racial cooperation off the court. While the proximate cause of the racial bias differs, the
ultimate consequence is the same.

9

hypothesis that as a passer becomes more familiar with his teammates, he will show less
same-race bias. The coefficient on the interaction between race and the first year on team
dummy is extremely small (-1.5 percentage points) and is not statistically significant.
In the fourth column, we examine a set of possessions in which one team is more
than fifteen points ahead of another in the fourth quarter. In such cases, because the
outcome of the game is already determined, players may be more willing to make
inefficient passes to same-race teammates. When we estimate our model with such a
specification, we find that the coefficient becomes about nine times as large but much
less precisely estimated. The coefficient indicates that, in these settings, white passers are
about 9.1 percentage points more likely to pass to a white shooter. This estimate is not
statistically significant and given the large standard errors, we cannot reject that this
coefficient is the same for the full sample. However, the results suggest that racial bias
may occur when the outcome of a particular task is no longer dependent on the worker’s
decisions.
We also perform a similar analysis on shots made during fourth quarter when the
score is within four points. In contrast to blowout games, players in such situations may
be willing to put aside racial bias in order to win the game. Indeed, we find that the
coefficient is one-third as large as in our baseline specification, although much less
precisely estimated.
Table 3 shows estimates of alternative specifications in which we approximate

θ w,S as shown in equation (3). As expected, we find that our estimate of θ w,S is close to
one, indicating that our constructed measure is a good proxy for the probability that the
assist recipient is white. Our test of own-race bias is based on whether deviations from

10

this predicated probability are influenced by the race of the passer. We find no evidence
of a preference by players to pass to players of their own race. Our estimate in the first
column indicates that the probability that a white player receives an assist is only 0.09
percentage points higher when the passer is white than when the passer is black. This
difference is even smaller when we control for the position of the passer.
In the third column, we test whether this measure of same-race bias changes as
players are with the same team longer. There is little evidence that this occurs. In the
fourth column, we look at the blowout games and find a very small negative coefficient
(the opposite of same-race bias) that is imprecisely estimated. Finally, in the fifth column,
we examine close games and discover a large positive coefficient that is also imprecisely
estimated.

Interpretation and Conclusion
Assist patterns in the NBA exhibit very little evidence of same-race bias. More
specifically, given a particular set of players on the court, a white passer is no more likely
to pass to a white teammate than a black passer. While this result is interesting, it is
important to note why the high degree of interracial cooperation may be specific to the
NBA.
Our model can be thought of as the final node in a more complex game in which
players are matched to teams and coaches decide which players are on the floor and
which plays are run. To the extent that some players exhibit strong same race
preferences, they may be matched to teams with a high frequency of same-race
teammates. Conditional upon the team roster, coaches may choose personnel

11

combinations in which efficient passing choices occur. Such optimizing behavior does
not affect the consistency of our results. It does imply, however, that our results only
reflect the level of same-race bias in situations that occur in equilibrium. The average
level of same race bias may be higher.
In many workplace environments, the effect of same-race bias in may not be
immediately apparent or have little impact on the actors involved. The NBA differs from
such instances in that player behavior is closely observed by coaches, owners, and many
thousands of fans and the result of poor interracial cooperation may have an immediate
effect on the outcome of the game. Also, to the extent that players derive utility from
winning, they have an immediate incentive to engage in interracial cooperation.
Ultimately, our findings do not imply that efficient interracial cooperation occurs
throughout the economy. They do imply, however, that interracial cooperation can occur
in equilibrium when incentives are well aligned for efficient cooperation. Firms may
want to consider how they can alter incentives to promote efficient cooperation among a
diverse workforce.
