ABSTRACT
Using a new survey, we document high dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms in
the European Union (EU). To interpret this dispersion, we develop a highly portable framework
to quantify gains from better allocation of resources. We demonstrate that, apart from direct
measures of distortions, firm characteristics, such as demographics, quality of inputs, utilization
of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs, are predictors of the marginal revenue products
of capital and labor. We emphasize that some firm characteristics may reflect compensating
differentials rather than constraints and the effect of constraints on the dispersion of marginal
products may hence be smaller than has been assumed in the literature. We show that crosscountry differences in the dispersion of marginal products in the EU are largely due to differences
in how the business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into
outcomes rather than to the differences in firm characteristics per se. Removing distortions could
raise EU aggregate productivity by 40 percent or more.

Introduction

Although the large cross-country differentials in income per capita have been the subject of much
research, accounting for sources of this dispersion has proven to be difficult. The most important factor
appears to be differences in “productivity”, which Moses Abramovitz famously called a measure of
our ignorance. In an attempt to explain “productivity” differences within and across countries, recent
research pioneered by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) emphasizes the importance of firm-level
misallocation of resources for aggregate economic outcomes. It is based on the insight that if there is
a dispersion of marginal revenue products of inputs across firms, the economy may achieve
considerable productivity – and hence output – gains by reallocating capital from firms with low
marginal revenue product of capital (MRPK) to firms with high MRPK and, similarly, from firms with
low marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) to firms with high MRPL. This concept is reflected in
the textbook outcome when cost-minimizing firms face identical input prices in a perfectly functioning
spot market economy and MRPK and MRPL are equalized across firms.
The recent slowdown in productivity growth in the United States, European Union (EU)
and other developed economies has generated a sense of urgency among policymakers and
academics to identify impediments to productivity increases and to find ways to spur economic
growth. Although a number of explanations has been put forth, rising misallocation of resources
could be one of the culprits (see, e.g., Gopinath et al., 2017 for an analysis of European countries).1
While existing research has been successful in measuring the dispersion of marginal
products and assessing potential gains from better allocation of resources, little is known about
why firms have different marginal products. To a large extent, the lack of research on this question
has been brought about by data limitations. In particular, research in this area typically uses censustype data to calculate MRPK or MRPL for firms in one economy. But these administrative data
usually contain only income statements, balance sheet information about capital, and basic data on
employment. As a result, researchers do not have complete firm-level information as well as rich,
consistently measured cross-country variation to tell why a given dispersion of MRPK or MRPL
exists. Furthermore, the lack of exogenous variation in potential explanatory variables limits the
scope of possible inferences or requires strong identification assumptions.

1

Consistent with this view, the dispersion of MRPK and MRPL within individual European countries and within
individual economic sectors has been trending up since the mid-1990s according to data in Orbis, a popular source of
firm-level data.

In this paper we aim to make progress along three key dimensions. First, we continue and
extend the long tradition of employing survey data for analyses of misallocation (e.g., Hsieh and
Klenow, 2009) and use a new, large cross-country survey of firms: the European Investment Bank
(EIB) Investment Survey (EIBIS).2 This survey was administered annually since 2016 to a stratified
random sample of firms in each of the 28 countries of the EU and is designed to be representative of
the business population for each EU country for different sectors and firm sizes. EIBIS contains
information about the investment behavior and constraints of firms – e.g., recent investment activities
and future priorities, how firms obtain capital and whether the quantity is sufficient, whether their
capital stock is state-of-the-art, and information about capacity utilization, rates of innovation, access
to infrastructure, and foreign presence in management. Survey responses are also matched to
administrative data of the firm (e.g., balance sheet information). Importantly, the design and
implementation of the survey is consistent across countries and sectors, which is critical for
understanding cross-country and cross-industry variation in the dispersion of marginal revenue
products. In addition, the survey does not only cover firms in the manufacturing sector but also firms
in services, utilities and construction.
Second, informed by a theoretical model, we develop an empirical framework to quantify
the contribution of various forces to the dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms and
map the contribution to potential productivity gains. Specifically, we show that under empirically
relevant conditions one can use marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 to obtain an upper bound for possible gains from
removing a friction by estimating equilibrium relationships (optimality conditions) in a regression
framework, thus linking the misallocation literature to Mincer (1958) and subsequent work
studying earnings inequality. This framework does not rely on exogenous variation in frictions or
other predictors of MRPK and MRPL which makes our approach highly portable.
Third, we examine the extent to which the dispersion of marginal products is related to
firm-level characteristics (as opposed to the usual country-level or sector-level effects) and we
compute the associated productivity gains. We note that while the existing literature treats the
dispersion of marginal products as reflecting barriers and distortions, this may not always be the case.
Some dispersion may reflects optimizing behavior of firms (e.g., paying compensating differentials
in the labor market), in which case it is economically rational from the standpoint of the firms and

2

Hsieh and Klenow (2009) use plant-level data from the Indian Annual Survey of Industries (ASI; 1987–1994) and
firm-level data from the Chinese Annual Survey of Industrial Production (1998–2005).

should be interpreted as a “cost” to aggregate productivity. While we cannot always establish which
of these phenomena is consistent with the data, we present a range of estimates consistent with various
interpretations. Relatedly, we perform a Machado-Mata decomposition to construct counterfactual
distributions of MRPK and MRPL for each country on the assumption that it has estimated
coefficients or values of explanatory variables from another country (e.g., Greece and Germany).
This decomposition exercise allows us to understand better whether observed dispersion in MRPK
and MRPL is brought about by cross-country differences in firm characteristics or cross-country
differences in how the business, institutional and policy environment guides the allocation of
resources across heterogeneous firms.
We document that there is a sizable dispersion of marginal products measured across all the
firms in our sample. Our estimates indicate that in terms of labor allocation firms are more
segmented across countries than industries, as seen in the fact that differences in the levels of MRPL
are higher across countries than across industries. The opposite is true for capital. This suggests that
national regulations and language barriers may play an important part in the efficiency of resource
allocation within the EU, particularly when labor is concerned. When we exploit the detailed firmlevel information in EIBIS, we find that the significant association between marginal products and
firm characteristics is predominantly driven by variables measuring firm demographics, quality of
inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs. In contrast, the contribution of
direct measures of “barriers and constraints” (which are a part of distortions) to cross-sectional
variation in MRPK and MRPL seems to be modest. Using the Machado-Mata decomposition we
document that the cross-country variation in the within-country dispersion of marginal revenue
products is largely brought about by differences in the regression coefficients – reflecting how a
country’s business, institutional and policy environment “prices” firm characteristics – rather than
by differences in the (“endowments” of) firm characteristics. This result is important because it
provides large-scale microeconomic evidence that institutions matter. In short, if one took the 28
EU countries as a single market where marginal products ought to be equalized, then the current
state of Europe is very far from that. We estimate that removing distortions to allocation of resources
across EU firms could raise productivity by 40 percent or more.
Our work is related to several strands of previous research. First, we contribute to the
rapidly growing literature measuring misallocation of resources (e.g., Restuccia and Rogerson,
2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Bartelsman et al., 2013; see Restuccia and Rogerson, 2013, 2017
3

for literature surveys). In particular, we document new facts about the allocation of capital and
labor across the 28 EU countries. Since EIBIS data are consistent across countries, our analysis is
particularly well suited for cross-country comparisons.
Second, we provide new insights into the nascent literature on sources of observed dispersion
in marginal products. For example, consistent with Asker et al. (2014), we show that dynamic
adjustment of inputs is an important force in accounting for cross-sectional variation in marginal
products. However, we also document that other firm characteristics and various measures of
distortions have predictive power for marginal revenue products. In contrast to previous work using
country-level measures of distortions (e.g., Gamberoni et al., 2016; Kalemli-Ozcan and Sorensen,
2012), tight theoretical restrictions (e.g., David and Venkateswaran, 2017) or specific reforms (e.g.,
Rotemberg 2019), we draw on the richness of our survey and utilize firm-level information about
various constraints and characteristics to account for cross-sectional variation in marginal revenue
products with minimal restrictions. As a result, we can move beyond comparison of raw dispersion
across countries, estimate the contribution of specific factors to misallocation, compute the
associated productivity losses, and maintain high external validity.
Third, by comparing administrative data to survey data, we contribute to recent efforts to
assess the importance of measurement errors in observed marginal products (e.g., Bils et al., 2017).
In particular, we document high consistency of responses in the survey data of EIBIS and the (censustype) administrative data of Orbis, thus showing that surveys can be a useful source of information so
that applied work does not necessarily have to use only data with census-like coverage. Furthermore,
data from administrative sources may contain manipulations (e.g., via imputation) that materially
influence dispersion and hence implied productivity gains (Rotemberg and White 2020), and these
manipulations vary across statistical agencies. As a result, we likely reduce systematic errors in our
data by applying the same EIBIS survey instrument across countries.
Finally, we relate a large literature studying dispersion of earnings across workers (see,
e.g., Heckman et al. 2006) to the studies of dispersion of marginal products across firms. We show
that many of the tools developed to understand the dispersion of worker earnings can be employed
to understand the dispersion of marginal products across firms.
From the policy point of view, our estimates relate to the debate on the need to remove
distortions in the EU single market. Launched in 1993, the single market allows for free mobility
of labor, capital, goods, and services within the EU. Persistency of frictions and distortions have
4

prevented the full exploitation of the associated benefits, with measurable costs of mis-allocation,
or costs of “non-Europe”.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section II we present a dynamic
model of a profit-maximizing firm that yields steady state conditions for MRPK and MRPL. We
use these conditions in Section III to formulate our estimating equations. In Section IV we describe
EIBIS and Orbis data sets and present our hypotheses related to the explanatory variables from
EIBIS. We present our empirical estimates in Section V and draw conclusions in Section VI.

age, corporate structure, access to credit markets, etc.) as primitive sources of variation in marginal
revenue across firms. Depending on the primitives, firms will choose different mixes of quantity and
quality of inputs and, perhaps, different technologies (Jones 2005).
Given that the share of pure economic profits is small (e.g., Basu and Fernald, 1997), we
can further simplify the expressions for marginal revenue products (see Appendix C, Section A)

These expressions lead us to conclude that the variation in marginal revenue products across firms
that we attribute to distortions 𝜏𝜏 may also reflect differences in adjustment costs, as well as input
quality, utilization rates, and taxes or regulation.

If one adjusted inputs for quality and/or account for adjustment costs and if the price
schedules were the same across firms, then marginal revenue products for effective units of capital
(𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), labor (𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), and intermediate inputs (Δ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) should be equalized across firms and the
7

cross-sectional dispersion ought to be zero. While appealing in theory, adjusting for quality
differences is fraught with a number of issues. For example, Hsieh and Klenow (2009) adjust for
quality differences in labor by dividing output by the wage bill (e.g., more educated workers receive
higher wages and so the wage bill should be higher) rather than by the number of employees so that
(1 − 𝜎𝜎 −1 )𝛽𝛽

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿

= 𝜏𝜏𝑌𝑌 provides a measure of distortions. One can make a similar argument for using
𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊

the ratio of output to the value of capital (rather than the number of machines). Apart from assuming

that observed input prices are allocative4, this approach implicitly assumes that distortions do not
accrue to the owners of inputs and wages can reflect only differences in quality (more generally,
market segmentation created by distortions is implicitly assumed to not influence factor prices in a
given firm or industry). For example, a distortion in the labor market is not captured by workers and
the distortion in revenue (𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿 − 1)𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 goes to a third party or is wasted. We view this assumption as
potentially problematic. For example, distortions created by trade unions are likely to be captured at

least partially by increased wages for union-covered workers, that is, the wage received by workers
is 𝜏𝜏 𝐿𝐿 𝑊𝑊 rather than 𝑊𝑊. Likewise, constraints on immigration almost certainly translate into higher
wages for incumbents. As a result, normalizing output by the wage bill not only adjusts for quality
differences but also eliminates some distortions that are absorbed into wages, i.e., this adjustment
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

can yield (1 − 𝜎𝜎 −1 )𝛽𝛽 𝜏𝜏𝐿𝐿𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = 𝜏𝜏𝑌𝑌 which does not include labor market distortions. Because we have
direct measures of quality and distortions, we can account for the importance of these directly in the
regression contexts by using these measures as controls.
If dispersion in marginal revenue products is due to distortions, Hsieh and Klenow (2009)

where subscripts 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗, 𝑐𝑐, 𝑡𝑡 index firms, sectors, countries and time. The discussion in Section II also

makes it clear that log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is a function of distortions, input quality, utilization, and other

variables (the right-hand side of equation (1)), which after further linearization may be summarized as
log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝜓𝜓𝑐𝑐 + 𝜅𝜅𝑗𝑗 + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝒃𝒃 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(4)

where 𝜓𝜓𝑐𝑐 is the set of country fixed effects, 𝜅𝜅𝑗𝑗 is the set of industry fixed effects, 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 is the set of

year fixed effects, 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the vector of explanatory variables (defined below), and 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the

disturbance term that captures unexplained variation in 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀. By combining equation (4) with

the empirical measurement of 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, we obtain an empirical “Mincerian-type” specification.6 An

analogous specification and approach is used for other inputs. Data permitting, one can also
estimate a more flexible specification with country × sector × year fixed effects 𝜂𝜂𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 :
log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝜂𝜂𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝒃𝒃 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

(4’)

If one does so, one of course has to expect that a significant part of the overall variation in firmspecific MRPK and MRPL will be absorbed by these country × sector × year fixed effects 𝜂𝜂𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and
that a smaller share of total variation will be explained by the vector 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

In estimating equation (4) and similar specifications, we generate several important

“outputs”. First, we can use 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 to compute a “residual” measure of dispersion in MRPL and

MRPK across countries to assess whether some cross-country variation can be explained by

differences in observable firm characteristics and to quantify the contribution of various distortions
and compensating differentials to the observed dispersion of marginal revenue products. Second,
we obtain estimates of 𝒃𝒃 and hence can evaluate how the explanatory variables 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 predict

MRPK and MRPL. Third, we can construct counterfactual distributions of MRPK and MRPL for
a given country if it had coefficients 𝒃𝒃 or endowments 𝑿𝑿 from another country. We will cover this
last point in Section V.D.

Mincer (1958) developed a similar econometric specification linking wages to education to rationalize observed
dispersion of earnings on the worker side. His insight was extended in subsequent work showing that wage dispersion
can be accounted for by other compensating differentials (e.g., work experience) and distortions (e.g., discrimination).
In a similar fashion to Mincer (1958) and subsequent work in labor economics, we aim to account for dispersion of
marginal revenue products on the firm side.

A. QUANTIFYING THE CONTRIBUTION OF OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS
Equation (2) makes it clear that we have fewer observables (marginal revenue products) than
distortions (𝜏𝜏 𝑌𝑌 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐾𝐾 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐿𝐿 , 𝜏𝜏 𝑋𝑋 ). In order to identify distortions from the observables, we need to impose

𝐿𝐿
a restriction. We follow Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and impose 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
= 1 for all 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑡𝑡.7 Under this

assumption, one can show (Appendix B) that8
𝑌𝑌
) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ),
log(𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

𝐾𝐾
) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ).
log(𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Hence, 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 can be estimated with 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 (log 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 with 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 − log 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ).
Because the variance of distortions is directly mapped into the dispersion of marginal

revenue products, there is a simple way to quantify a productivity gain from “removing” a friction.
Consider specification (4) with marginal revenue product of capital as the dependent variable. We
are interested in how much variation in marginal revenue products is explained by a given regressor
or a set of regressors. 𝑅𝑅 2 provides a convenient estimate for this object of interest.

We can quantify the contribution of a given friction to the variation in 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 across firms

with the marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 associated with the friction, that is, the increase in 𝑅𝑅 2 when a regressor

measuring the friction is added to some baseline regression. Because 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 ))

under our assumptions, it follows that the change in 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 after removing the friction is

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 )) × (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑅𝑅 2 ).9 Likewise, we can compute the change in 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 as
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 ) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 )) × (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑅𝑅 2 ) where (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 ) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 )) is

the dependent variable in the regression. Thus, we measure productivity gains from removing a
friction with
𝛼𝛼(1 − 𝛼𝛼) 𝛼𝛼 2 𝜎𝜎
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = − �
+
� × 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 ) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 )) × (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑅𝑅 2 )

− × 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 )) × (𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑅𝑅 2 ).
2

The results are qualitatively similar when we use an alternative assumption that 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡𝐾𝐾 = 1 for all 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑡𝑡.
Because we do not have a measure of material cost in EIBIS, we cannot recover a distortion in inputs. However, we know
that this distortion has a non-negative variance and hence this distortion will lower aggregate productivity and output. Hence,
by ignoring this distortion, we likely understate the gains from improving resource allocation across firms.
9
The marginal R2 is symmetric in the following sense. First, we can compute the marginal R2 as a change in R2 when
we add regressor 𝑋𝑋2 to the specification 𝑌𝑌 = 𝑏𝑏1 𝑋𝑋1 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒. Second, we can compute the marginal R2 as a change in
R2 when we remove regressor 𝑋𝑋2 in the specification 𝑌𝑌 = 𝑏𝑏1 𝑋𝑋1 + 𝑏𝑏2 𝑋𝑋2 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒.

B. ENDOGENEITY OF REGRESSORS
Because 𝑿𝑿 is likely not exogenous, the estimates of 𝒃𝒃 are not causal and hence the interpretation

of 𝒃𝒃 is not straightforward. Finding convincing instrumental variables for many regressors in 𝑿𝑿
appears to us to be an unsurmountable challenge. As a result, our empirical strategy is based on

two different insights that do not rely on exogeneity of 𝑿𝑿. First, we know that under the null
hypothesis of no misallocation, none of the regressors should have predictive power for marginal
revenue products. This simple test does not rely on exogeneity of regressors.
Second and more importantly, we are interested in how much variation in marginal revenue
products is explained by a given regressor or a set of regressors, i.e., 𝑅𝑅 2 rather than 𝒃𝒃. We know

from basic econometrics that estimating specification (4) and similar specifications with OLS will

(weakly) overstate 𝑅𝑅 2 . That is, one can show (all derivations may be found in Appendix D) that for
e.g., log (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)

2
𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜖𝜖�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 )

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜖𝜖�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 )

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀))

(5)

where 𝜖𝜖̂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 is the estimated error term in the OLS regression and 𝜖𝜖̂𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 is the structural error term in

the instrumental variable (IV) regression. Intuitively, some of the attributed variation in OLS

estimates could be due to, e.g., simultaneity or omitted variables that may confound an OLS
estimated relationship between marginal revenue products and regressors.10 Thus, (marginal) 𝑅𝑅 2 in
an OLS estimate of specification (4) is a biased estimate but it provides an upper bound for how
much variation in marginal revenue products can be due to a given friction or a given compensating
differential measured in 𝑿𝑿. As we discussed in the previous section, because larger 𝑅𝑅 2 s are ceteris

paribus associated with greater productivity gains and OLS yields an upper bound for 𝑅𝑅 2 , we likely
provide an upper bound for productivity gains from a better allocation of resources across firms.

While having an upper bound may be only partially informative, our analysis does not rely on a
structural interpretation of 𝒃𝒃 and thus opens a number of opportunities. For example, one does not
have to restrict the analysis only to variables with well-identified, exogenous variation. Likewise,
one does not have to impose tight theoretical restrictions to achieve identification.

There are also a few practical concerns with using the insight of equation (5). First, 𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼

could be equally problematic for

measuring the contribution of exogenous variation in 𝑿𝑿 to variation in log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) because 𝑿𝑿 is

from the first-stage regression (for OLS, 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂

). We show in Appendix D that 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
is

2
guaranteed to be greater than 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
when 𝑿𝑿 is positively (negatively) correlated with 𝜖𝜖 and 𝑿𝑿 is

positively (negatively) correlated with log (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀). This condition is, for instance, satisfied when

an omitted variable (e.g., the entrepreneurial talent of a manager) raises log (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) and makes a
distortion more binding because (e.g., a growing firm is more likely to run into red tape). In turn,

this entails a higher log (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) because the firm has too little capital due to red tape. This setting

appears plausible to us and we take 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂

2
Second, measurement error in 𝑿𝑿 will attenuate 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
toward zero. In particular, we show in
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑥𝑥)

where 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑥𝑥) is the variance of a correctly measured
Appendix D that 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂

regressor 𝑥𝑥 and 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜂𝜂) is the variance of classical measurement error 𝜂𝜂. If one has 𝑁𝑁

measurements of 𝑥𝑥 with uncorrelated measurement errors, one can reduce the bias by running the

= 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡

. We will use this insight to assess

how/if measurement errors can materially alter our conclusions. We also show that, with multiple
measurements of 𝑥𝑥, one can use one measurement as an instrument for another measurement (e.g.,

and 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼

. Thus, even in this

case 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
is an upper bound.11

Data

The main data source for our analysis is the EIB Investment Survey (EIBIS). In this section we
provide information on the design and implementation of the survey. We also compare EIBIS

11

Classical measurement error may affect the level of dispersion in marginal revenue products. However, because classical
measurement error is additive in terms of variances, it does not influence the variance contribution attributed to a friction.

12

responses to the administrative data of the surveyed firms, as collected in the Orbis database. Once
we establish consistency across the survey and administrative data, we describe survey questions
that we use in the empirical analysis to account for the variation in MRPK and MRPL across firms.

A. THE EIB INVESTMENT SURVEY (EIBIS)
EIBIS is an annual firm-level survey conducted by the market research company Ipsos MORI on
behalf of the European Investment Bank (see Ipsos, 2019, for a detailed review of the survey). The
first wave of EIBIS was administrated in 2016, targeting firms in the 28 EU member states, with
the objective of being representative in each country for different size classes and sectors. The
sampling targeted head offices.12 Eligible respondents were senior persons with responsibility for
investment decisions and how investments were financed. This person could be the owner, the
finance manager, finance director or head of accounts, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or Chief
Executive Officer (CEO).
The sample was stratified disproportionally by country, industry group (sector) and sizeclass, and stratified proportionally by region within the country. The minimum number of
employees of all enterprises is 5, with full-time and part-time employees being counted as one
employee and employees working less than 12 hours per week being excluded. The Orbis dataset
of Bureau van Dijk was used as the sampling frame in all countries. Brutscher et al. (2020) provide
evidence on representativeness of the data for the business population of interest (namely
enterprises above 5 employees) by comparing distributions in EIBIS with the population of firmlevel data available in Eurostat’s Structural Business Statistics (SBS).
The fieldwork for the first wave started in July 2016 and continued until November 2016.
The vast majority of the interviews were conducted in the months of August and September 2016.
The interview was administrated by telephone using computer-assisting telephone interviewing
(CATI). The responses refer to the fiscal year 2015. The response rate was approximately 13 percent,
which is typical for surveys of executives (Cycyota and Harrison, 2006). The resulting sample of
the first wave consists of 12,483 non-financial enterprises in the 28 EU member states in NACE
categories C to J (industrial firms). The sample size varies across countries and ranges from 150
enterprises in Cyprus and Luxembourg to 600 in France, Germany, Italy and the UK. A total

12

An enterprise is defined as a company trading as its own legal entity. As such, branches were excluded from the
target population. However, the definition is broader than a typical enterprise survey given that some company
subsidiaries are their own legal entities.

13

sample of 12,300 firms was targeted, with 150, 400, 475, or 600 interviews per country depending
on the size of the population. Because the sampling frame as well as the resulting samples may not
be fully representative, Ipsos MORI constructed weights to correct for possible imbalances. In
particular, firms are weighted to make them representative of the EU economy based on country,
sector and firm size (employment) where the population distribution is reported by SBS.
The second (2017) and third (2018) waves have similar properties and were conducted
between April and August 2017 and 2018. In the end of each wave, firms are invited to participate
in the next wave of the survey so that EIBIS has a panel component. Approximately 2,000 firms
participated in all three waves and approximately 4,500 firms participated in two waves. We have
on average 24 firms per country/year/industry (2-digit NACE classification) cell.
EIBIS is a rich source of information with a number of unique characteristics. First, EIBIS
collects basic information on firms (e.g., number of employees, value of fixed assets, sales) which is
matched to administrative data.13 This feature of the survey allows us to cross-check survey responses
against data from administrative sources and hence to assess the quality of survey data. Second, EIBIS
gathers data on expectations and perceptions of firms’ management (e.g., perceived obstacles to
investment, plans for future investment) as well as statistics that are often not available in standard
official sources (e.g., quality of capital, capacity utilization, sources of financing). These variables can
inform us directly about sources of variation in marginal revenue products across firms and we can
thus make progress relative to studies based only on income statements and balance sheets. Third,
EIBIS data are collected in a consistent manner for a large number of firms across many countries
and industries, thus permitting us to carry out a comparative analysis of resource allocation in various
institutional settings. Using these unique data, we explore the relationship between MRPK and MRPL
and a large number of explanatory variables at the firm level. To this end, we use questions on firm
demographics, capacity utilization, quality of the capital stock, obstacles to long-term investment,
investment plans, investment rate, employment growth, and sources of finance.

13

The data on each firm from EIBIS was merged with Orbis and the match was done by Ipsos-Mori, which provided
anonymized data to the EIB. This means that EIBIS does not have the name, the address, the contact details or any
additional individual information that could identify the firms in the final sample. Note that not every firm in EIBIS
has complete information in Orbis (e.g., Orbis may have missing information on employment while EIBIS does not).

14

B. COMPARISON OF SURVEY AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA
The Orbis database is a popular source of administrative data for cross-country analyses at the firm
level.14 We use these data to cross-check EIBIS responses. In particular, we match firms’ EIBIS
responses with their administrative (Orbis) data and compare cross-firm dispersion of the logarithm
of sales, fixed assets and employment in the EIBIS and Orbis for those firms by country (Table 1)
and by industry (Table 2). In columns (4), (7) and (10) of Tables 1 and 2, we also report correlations
between the responses in EIBIS and the administrative data in Orbis.
We observe high consistency across the two sources of data. For example, the correlation
between log employment in EIBIS and administrative data in Orbis is 0.91. The dispersion of the
survey responses across firms is on average slightly larger than the dispersion in the administrative
data, which is consistent with small noise (measurement error) in survey responses. Note that relative
to the data on fixed assets, data on employment are available for fewer firms in the Orbis database.
Because the EIBIS uses a random sample of firms, we also evaluate whether dispersion of
the sales-to-capital and sales-to-labor ratios estimated on the sample is consistent with the
dispersion calculated for the population of firms. For this exercise, we use data for countries that
have excellent (i.e., close to population) coverage in Orbis for each industry and firm size category
(Brutscher et al. 2020): Italy, Portugal, and Romania. We find that mean absolute log difference
between EIBIS and Orbis measures of standard deviations computed at the country level is
approximately 2 percent, that is, the two sources of data produce very similar measures of
dispersion. We conclude that EIBIS provides a satisfactory quality of firm-level data and that the
survey responses are therefore suitable for our analysis.

C. DISPERSION OF MARGINAL REVENUE PRODUCTS
We report descriptive statistics for the EIBIS sample in Table 3. The key statistic for our analysis is
the dispersion of marginal revenue products. We observe a sizable dispersion across firms in the EU:
the standard deviation is 1.43 for log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀), 1.19 for log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀), and 1.63 for (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) −

log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)).15 For comparison, the dispersion of marginal value-added product across
14

See Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2015) and Bajgar et al. (2020) for a detailed analysis of the (dis)advantages of using this dataset.
We find similar magnitudes when we use robust methods to estimate standard deviation. For example, when we
employ median absolute deviation (MAD) to estimate 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠. 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑. = 1.48 × 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 where 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚|𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥�|, 𝑥𝑥� =
𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) and 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 is a random variable, we find that the standard deviation is1.49 for log 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, 1.14 for log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)
and 1.68 for (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)).
15

15

establishments (“plants”) for the U.S. is 0.98 for capital (Table 2 in Asker et al., 2014) and 0.58
for labor (Table 1 in Bartelsman et al., 2013).
Note that there are three potentially confounding sources of differences between our
statistics and statistics reported for the U.S. First, EIBIS does not collect information on the cost
of intermediate inputs and we therefore use sales to compute marginal revenue products for capital
and labor, while previous studies use value added. Using EIBIS firms matched to the Orbis
database (which has information on sales and value added), we find that the standard deviation of
log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) based on sales is approximately 0.16 log points higher than the standard deviation of

log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) based on value added. On the other hand, the standard deviation of log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) based
on sales is approximately 0.21 log points lower than the standard deviation of log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) based
on value added. Thus, using revenue rather than value added does not appear to explain the
difference between the EU and US.
Second, our analysis is based on survey responses while US studies typically rely on

administrative data. We might observe a US-EU difference in dispersion because survey data are
more likely to have measurement error. As we discuss above, however, survey responses in EIBIS
are broadly consistent with administrative data in Orbis.16 To explore further the quantitative
significance of measurement error, we exploit the panel component of EIBIS and compute the
average log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) and log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) across years for a given firm, as well as cross-sectional

dispersion of these averages. The disadvantage of taking averages across years (using repeated
measurements) is that one attenuates not only measurement errors but also transitory factors (e.g.,
adjustment costs or high-frequency variation in demand) and the reduction in dispersion is likely
to overstate the role of measurement errors. With this caveat in mind, we find that, in a consistent
sample of firms, the standard deviation of average log 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 is 8 percent lower for firms
participating in two waves of the survey and 12 percent lower for firms participating in three

waves. The corresponding figures for log 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 are 4 percent for two-wave firms and 1 percent

for three-wave firms. These results suggest that measurement error can account for only a portion
of the EU-US difference in the dispersion of marginal revenue products. Note that while
16
In agreement with high consistency in measures of employment, capital, and sales across data sources, we observe
that measured dispersion of marginal revenue products is similar in EIBIS and Orbis. For example, for the sample of
EIBIS firms that are matched to Orbis firms with non-missing data (6,432 firms in 2015), the standard deviation of
log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) is 1.44 in Orbis and 1.37 in EIBIS. The corresponding figures for log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) are 1.07 in Orbis and 1.30
in EIBIS. Consistent with some measurement error in survey responses, the dispersion of MRPL is somewhat larger
in the survey than in administrative data.

16

measurement error can influence the level of dispersion, our objective is to study what part of
dispersion in marginal revenue products can be rationalized by various measures of distortions and
compensating differentials. As we show below, using three-year averages does not alter our
calculations of variance contributions due to these forces.
Third, the unit of analysis in EIBIS is either a firm or a subsidiary which is a (weakly)
larger unit than an establishment. Kehrig and Vincent (2017) document that approximately twothirds of the variance in marginal value-added product of capital across establishments happens
across establishments within a firm; that is, variance across firms is approximately one-third of the
variance across establishments. Hence, comparing the US and EU figures is likely to understate
the difference between the two economies.
While contrasting the EU and US figures highlights challenges of cross-country
comparisons, it is clear that qualitatively the greater dispersion of marginal revenue products
(misallocation of resources) in the EU relative to the US is consistent with lower aggregate
productivity in the EU relative to the US (e.g., van Ark et al., 2008). Fortunately, EIBIS covers many
EU member states and we can exploit the consistency of measurement across countries within the
survey to examine whether greater dispersion of marginal revenue products is associated with lower
aggregate productivity. Figure 1 demonstrates that, as predicted by theory, there is a robust negative
correlation between dispersion and productivity. This fact not only adds credibility to survey-based
measures of marginal revenue products, but it also provides further motivation for studying
dispersion as a potential source of cross-country productivity differences.

D. EIBIS VARIABLES USED IN THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS
We consider several blocks of variables available in the survey to construct vector 𝑿𝑿 in equation (4).

We next discuss possible relationships between the variables and marginal revenue products. The
choice of variables is motivated by previous work and is partially constrained by data availability.17
Some of the variables in the survey are qualitative, which creates some distance between an ideal
theoretical metric and its survey measure. However, even these imperfect measures — which are
often used for policy (e.g., World Bank uses similar measures to construct its Ease of Doing Business
index) and research (e.g., Djankov et al. 2002) — allow us to go well beyond what one can achieve

17

Lack of data prevents us from exploring the importance of firm-level variation in market power (mark-ups). To the
extent other variables are correlated with markups, we can overstate the quantitative significance of these other
variables in accounting for observed variation in marginal revenue products.

17

using only administrative data. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3 (and by survey wave
in Appendix Table A.1). While we include many regressors to fully exploit the richness of the EIBIS,
one should not be concerned with overfitting in specification (4) because the sample size is very
large relative to the number of regressors.
Firm demographics
Employment size: Garicano et al. (2016), Bento and Restuccia (2017), Eslava et al. (2019) and other
studies document that various size-based policies can introduce distortions to the scale of operation
and, hence, allocation of resources (e.g., firms in low-productivity countries are systematically
smaller than firms in high-productivity countries).
Firm age: Hsieh and Klenow (2014) and others argue that productivity of firms may have an
important life-cycle component. For example, firms may accumulate more organizational capital
as they age. On the other hand, one may expect that firms that have been longer in existence have
older and probably lower quality capital so that older firms could have lower measured MRPK.
Subsidiary status – Subsidiaries may have access to cheap intra-group capital, resulting in a lower
optimal MRPK, or they may be rationed and monitored for efficient use of capital by the parent
company, resulting in a higher MRPK. Subsidiaries may also have a higher quality capital,
resulting in higher MRPK. As regards labor, subsidiaries of foreign firms tend to pay higher wages
than local firms (see, e.g., Lipsey, 2003; and Malchow-Møller et al., 2013). One may hence expect
that their MRPL will be higher than that of other firms. Approximately a third of firms in our
sample are subsidiaries.
Exporter status: Being more exposed to competition, exporters are relatively more likely to employ
high-quality, and hence more expensive inputs (see, e.g., Verhoogen, 2008).
Utilization and quality of inputs
Quality of capital: OECD (2001) and other statistical agencies emphasize that proper measurement
of productivity requires adjustment for the quality of inputs (e.g., new vintages of capital goods).
In our context, a higher quality of capital, measured by a greater share of “machinery and
equipment (including ICT) that are state-of-the-art”, and a higher proportion of “commercial
buildings that satisfy high energy efficiency standards” are expected to have a positive effect on

18

MRPK if they represent an upward shift in the MRPK curve or a negative effect if they constitute
a movement along the MRPK curve.
Capacity utilization: Fernald (2001) and others document that variable utilization of resources can
materially influence measured productivity. For example, firms operating at (or even above)
maximum capacity are expected to have high MRPK and MRPL as all machinery, equipment and
labor are used to the fullest extent and there is demand for more. Utilization can also help us control
for firm-level variation in the composition of transitory vs. persistent shocks. Intuitively, Abel and
Eberly (1998) show that, when facing adjustment costs, firms should use utilization in response to
transitory shocks and adjust inputs (buy more machines or hire more workers) in response to
persistent shocks.
Obstacles to investment
The variables included in this cluster are answers of firms’ top management to questions about
constraints on investment. The World Bank and other institutions use similar questions to construct
measures for barriers to entry, which have been related to reduced productivity (see e.g.,
Gorodnichenko et al. 2010; Commander and Svejnar 2011; World Bank 2018).18 When asked about a
specific potential constraint, the respondent in EIBIS reports whether he/she considers it to be a “major
obstacle”, “minor obstacle”, or “not an obstacle at all”. The list of constraints includes: Demand for
products or services, Availability of staff with the right skills, Energy costs, Access to digital
infrastructure, Availability of adequate transport infrastructure, Labor market regulation,
Business regulations and taxation, Availability of finance, Uncertainty about future. For each
obstacle, approximately 20-40 percent of firms report it to be a major obstacle and another 30
percent regard it as a minor obstacle.
Dynamic adjustment
Firms are exposed to a variety of shocks and with adjustment costs it may take time and resources for
firms to reoptimize factor allocation. Although EIBIS data does not have a large panel component yet,
the survey asks questions about firms’ current and previous investment choices – an aspect that enables
us to examine the dynamics of inflows and outflows of capital and labor.19 These variables can help

18

While these indicators may be imperfect measures of various barriers, they are relevant variables from the viewpoint
of policymakers. Indeed, many governments focus on addressing poor scores on these variables so as to move up in
various rankings.
19
Since EIBIS does not have information about material costs, we assume implicitly that materials may be adjusted quickly.

19

understand misallocation because, as argued by Asker et al. (2014), the variability of input growth can
inform us about the importance of adjustment costs. Indeed, the optimality conditions in equation (1)
highlight that, with adjustment costs, current marginal revenue products depend on past and future
choices of capital, labor and other inputs. The variables included in this cluster are:
Investment: Investment increases the amount of capital used and should result in a lower MRPK as
the firm experiences diminishing returns to capital (movement down along the MRPK curve). While
it is common to use investment rate (that is, investment normalized by capital stock or by sales), we
use log(1 + 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖). Our choice is motivated by the possible presence of measurement error
in reported fixed assets and/or sales. Since these two variables appear on the left-hand side of
equation (4), the conventional scaling of investment may introduce spurious correlations due to
measurement errors. We use the log transformation to take care of the thick right tail in the volume
of investment. We add one to the transformation to keep in the sample firms with zero investment.
Employment growth over the past three years: This explanatory variable should have a negative
effect on MRPL as the firm experiences diminishing returns to labor.
Investment over the past three years: This variable comes in the form of management’s
information about whether this investment was “too much”, “too little” or “about the right
amount.” One would expect that “too much” results in a low MRPK as the firm experiences
diminishing returns to capital, while “too little” goes the other way.
Investment plans for the next three years: Our derivations indicate that MRPK should be a function
of not only current and past investment rates but also expected future investment activities. Thus,
having information about firms’ investment plans may be useful in explaining contemporaneous
dispersion of MRPK across firms. A unique feature of EIBIS data is that the survey asks firms to
report their investment priority for the next three years, which contrasts with studies such as Asker
et al (2014) that have data only on realized investment. Specifically, firms can report whether
investment will focus on “replacing capacity (existing buildings, machine, equipment and IT)”,
“expanding capacity for existing products and services”, “developing or introducing new products,
processes or services”, or “do not have investment planned.” There is no a priori expectation as to
which types of investment (replacement versus capacity expansion) would enhance or diminish the
effect of the investment rate variable. However, the response “developing or introducing new
20

products, processes or services” may be expected to have a positive effect on MRPK as the firm
expands into these new areas and needs time to accumulate the optimal capital stock. The most
popular investment priority is “replacing capacity” (35 percent).
Source of funding
Share of investment funded by internal and external finance: Firms may have different cost of capital
depending for instance on how old they are or how connected they are to capital markets. In
particular, a number of studies (e.g., Desai et al., 2004; Fama and French, 2002) document that the
cost of external funds is higher than the cost of internal funds (or funds obtained within a business
group). EIBIS asks firms with positive investment to report the source of their funds to pay for their
investment (internal, external, intra-group).
Credit constraint: Midrigan and Xu (2014) and others document that credit frictions can generate
misallocation of capital. To measure the importance of this channel, we use an indicator variable that
is equal to one if a firm was rejected in its loan application, was discouraged from applying for a
loan, or received a loan that was too small or too expensive.
Data filters and additional data
To minimize potentially adverse effects of extreme observations, we winsorize continuous
variables at the top and bottom one percent. For firms with missing information for a given
variable, we impute the average value of that variable in the industry-country cell.20 For each
variable, we create a corresponding indicator variable taking value one if the values were imputed.
We include these indicator variables as additional regressors but do not report their estimated
coefficients in the regression tables. We estimate the cost shares for labor and materials using data
from the Industrial Analysis section of the OECD’s Structural Analysis Database (STAN) or from
Eurostat national accounts that are available at the level of the country, year and industry (2-digit
NACE classification).21

20
We impute 3.3 percent of observations. The results are qualitatively similar if we constrain the sample to
observations with non-missing values.
21
We use cost shares to make industries/countries more comparable so that we do not need to rely on fixed effects to
study dispersion of marginal revenue products. We find similar results when we use industry-specific cost shares
instead of firm-specific cost shares.

Empirical Analysis

In this section, we present four sets of results. First, we explore the extent to which firm
characteristics predict log(MRPK) and log(MRPL). Second, we use our estimates to quantify
productivity gains from better allocation of resources. Third, we consider how adjustment for
observed firm characteristics can influence measures of cross-sectional dispersion in MRPK and
MRPL and hence potentially reduce inefficiencies in resource allocation. Fourth, we assess
whether the observed cross-country dispersion in MRPK and MRPL is due to differences in firm
characteristics (“endowments,” as reflected in the values of the explanatory variables) or to
differences in how these characteristics are “priced” (i.e., in how regression coefficients –
reflecting business, institutional and policy environment – affect MRPK and MRPL).

A. REGRESSION RESULTS
Our preferred specification for the regression analysis is equation (4’), in which we enter as
regressors variables 𝑿𝑿 together with country × industry × year fixed effects. We re-iterate that we
do not interpret the estimated relationships as causal. We estimate equilibrium relationships and
estimated coefficients may therefore have signs and magnitudes potentially inconsistent with
priors built on causal relationships between the variables. For example, we may observe a positive
association between a marginal product and a constraint because the constraint is only binding for
the more advanced firms. While this is a limitation, our analysis has important benefits. Recall that
if 𝑿𝑿 does not predict the variation in marginal revenue products across firms, under certain

conditions one can use “raw” marginal revenue products to compute productivity losses from the
dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms. On the other hand, if 𝑿𝑿 predicts a sizable
fraction of the variation in marginal revenue products, then the dispersion of “raw” marginal

revenue products is potentially not the appropriate indicator for productivity calculations.
Moreover, in our explanatory analysis we assess the potential of 𝑿𝑿 to predict the variation of

marginal revenue products in the data which provides an upper bound on the magnitude of causal
effects and thus (marginal) 𝑅𝑅 2 is an informative statistic.

Whether the variables in vector 𝑿𝑿 reflect genuine distortions (e.g., undesirable regulations)

or compensating differentials (e.g., quality of inputs or intensity of effort) influences how one
should interpret the relatively high 𝑅𝑅 2 s. If the variables measure distortions, then our estimates

suggest that by removing distortions one can achieve considerable productivity gains. On the other

22

hand, if variables in 𝑿𝑿 measure compensating differentials, then 𝑅𝑅 2 s point to adjustments that one

should make before calculating productivity losses. In other words, the observed dispersion may
overstate inefficiency and hence also productivity losses. To illustrate this point, we later classify
𝑿𝑿 into “distortions” and “compensating differentials”, although as we emphasized above, the

interpretation of the estimated coefficients is tentative and the issue ought to be tackled
systematically in future research.
We report estimated coefficients of equation (4) in Appendix Table A.4.22 Because the
coefficients do not have a structural interpretation, we provide only a brief overview of selected
correlations. Older, exporting, high-utilization firms are predicted to have higher MRPK and MRPL.
Obstacles for investment generally have mixed associations with marginal revenue products. In the
“adjustment” block, investment has a strong negative association with MRPK and a positive
association with MRPL.23 These associations are consistent with movements along the MRPK curve
and a shift in the MRPL curve: as investment increases the amount of capital used, it should result
in a lower MRPK as the firm experiences diminishing returns to capital (movement down along the
MRPK curve) and a higher MRPL as labor becomes relatively scarcer. Symmetrically, we find that
employment growth in the last three years is associated with a higher MRPK and lower MRPL.24
The “credit constrained” status is negatively correlated with MRPL and MRPK. Note that while
variables in 𝑿𝑿 may be correlated (the correlation matrix is reported in Appendix Table A.3), thus
making the interpretation of individual coefficients challenging, we focus on R2 which does not

depend on how correlated regressors are. Furthermore, we also report results when we include blocks
of variables one at a time, thus showing also the contribution of a given set of variables.
Our analysis of partial correlations suggests that the significant cross-sectional association
between marginal products and firm characteristics varies across blocks of variables. For example,
as may be seen in Table A.4, variables measuring firm demographics, dynamic adjustment of
inputs, and source of funds appear to have robust predictive power. On the other hand, the

22

The results are qualitatively similar when we restrict the sample to firms that participated in all three waves of the
survey (Appendix Table A.5). The results are also similar when we estimate equation (4) for each wave separately.
23
The results are similar when we include an indicator variable equal to one if a firm reports positive investment, and
zero otherwise (the baseline specification uses log(1+investment)). See Appendix Table A.7 (analogue of Table A.4).
24
One may be concerned that we use employment and capital (investment) measured with error to compute the
dependent variables and use the same employment and capital as a regressor because measurement error can
mechanically create a negative correlation between a regressor and a regressand. To address this concern, we use
employment and investment from Orbis as regressors and we find nearly identical results (compare Appendix Tables
A.4 and A.17).

23

contribution of the “constraint” variables — a direct, but partial measure of distortions — to the
variation in MRPK and MRPL is modest, with some coefficients not being statistically significant.
In the memorandum section of Table A.4 we also see that the 𝑅𝑅 2 for the specification without
(with) fixed effects is 0.14 (0.49) for MRPK and 0.29 (0.74) for MRPL, which may appear

somewhat small but in fact is in line with 𝑅𝑅 2 s estimated for Mincerian wage regressions and for

regressions with detailed firm/worker fixed effects (see, e.g., Card et al., 2013).

In order to quantify these observations, in Table 4 (panels A and B) we present marginal
𝑅𝑅 2 s for blocks of variables, that is, by how much 𝑅𝑅 2 increases after a given block of variables is

added to various fixed effects specifications. We observe for both MRPK and MRPL that the
marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 s are the largest for variables in the “adjustment” and “demographics” blocks, and that
they are relatively low for variables in the “obstacles to investment” block.25

For illustration purposes, we next lump these blocks of variables into two groups. In the
first group we include “quality of capital,” “capacity utilization,” and “adjustment.” We interpret
this group as compensating differentials because they could be argued to reflect firm policies. Our
reasoning relates to Mincer (1958) emphasizing that more educated workers have higher
productivity and hence demand a compensating premium for accumulating higher human capital.
In a similar spirit, higher-quality capital may demand a compensating differential for the cost of
inputs necessary to ensure higher quality. The second group of variables includes “demographics,”
“obstacles to investment,” and “source of funds,” which we interpret as constraints and distortions
because they reflect predetermined factors and business environment. We see in Table 4 that in
terms of marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 the predictive power is similar for the two groups of variables. Conditional

on accepting this classification of variables, one can reach two important conclusions. First, the

“raw” dispersion in marginal products is likely to overstate the extent of misallocation since some
variation is likely to be brought about by heterogeneity in the “quality” of inputs. Second,
“distortions” are likely to be substantial and removing them may lead to significant gains in
productivity.
In Appendix Tables A.6, A.7, A.8 we find similar results when we estimate equation (4’)
using a “between” regression — a regression that is estimated on average (across years) values of

As we saturate the regression with fixed effects, the variance contribution in 𝑌𝑌 due to 𝑿𝑿 shrinks. The remaining
explanatory power of 𝑿𝑿 in this case is comparable to 4-5 percent reported for time-varying worker characteristics in
other studies (e.g., Card et al., 2013).

25

24

the regressors and regressands. This specification likely reduces the importance of transitory
factors such as measurement errors and adjustment costs. These results suggest that measurement
error is unlikely to overturn our conclusions.

B. PRODUCTIVITY GAINS
Equation (3’) provides a straightforward approach to measure potential gains from improved
allocation of resources. For our approximate estimates of productivity losses due to potential
misallocation, we use 𝑠𝑠̅ 𝐾𝐾 (equal to 0.19 in the data) to parameterize 𝛼𝛼. We follow Hsieh and
Klenow (2009) and calibrate 𝜎𝜎 = 3 which likely yields a conservative estimate of productivity
losses due to misallocation. With these parameter values, the weight on 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 is 1.50 and the weight

on 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 is 0.13.

We carry out calculations for several policy scenarios. First, assume that the policymakers

would eliminate the dispersion in marginal revenue products brought about by the “distortions”
group of variables. To have a level of variation in marginal revenue products, we use the dispersion
from Table 3: 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)) = 1.192 ≈ 1.42 and 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)) =

1.632 ≈ 2.66. Table 4 reports the marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 for various specifications without and with fixed

effects. Clearly, the marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 decreases as we add a richer set of fixed effects. To obtain an

upper bound on productivity gains, we consider the marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 without fixed effects (column

(1)). The marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 s of the “distortions group” are 0.186 for log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) (row 17, Table 4) and

0.134 for (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) − log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)) (row 26, Table 4). It follows that the gain in productivity
is 1.5 × 1.42 × 0.186 + 0.13 × 2.66 × 0.134 = 0.442, which is reported in Panel D (row 35,
column 1) of Table 4. In other words, removing distortions can raise aggregate productivity by
more than 40 percent.
Second, consider the possibility that all variables in X capture distortions. In this case, the
marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 s are 0.289 for log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) (row 18, Table 4) and 0.289 for (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) −

log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)) (row 27, Table 4). With these marginal 𝑅𝑅 2 s, the gain is 1.5 × 1.42 × 0.289 +

0.13 × 2.66 × 0.289 = 0.715, which is reported in Panel D (row 36, column 1) of Table 4.

Interestingly, variables in the “adjustment” block contribute to productivity gains (row 32) as much

as variables in the “demographics” block (row 28). In short, treating all variables in 𝑿𝑿 as distortions

increases the magnitude of potential gains by over one-half relative to the first scenario. Consistent
with our prediction that measurement errors can attenuate estimated productivity gains, we find
25

higher gains when we use “between” regressions (Appendix Table A.8), but the difference from
the baseline estimates in Table 4 is small.
These results suggest that the EU has the potential to increase productivity considerably by
improving its allocation of resources. Obviously, the magnitude of the gains depends on the
interpretation of variables collected in 𝑿𝑿 but our approach is highly portable and can provide an

upper-bound estimate for any variable of interest. Indeed, comparing dispersion of marginal

revenue products across countries may be a first step in identifying the problem, but our approach
permits one to identify which factors are likely to be most limiting. Given that frictions are often
best measured with surveys (e.g., where firms may report the importance of various barriers,
regulation, etc.), EIBIS and other similar initiatives can provide a key input for policymakers.

C. CROSS-COUNTRY AND CROSS-INDUSTRY DIFFERENCES
In our data, there is also considerable cross-country variation in the average marginal revenue
products – 0.33 for log(MRPK) and 0.70 for log(MRPL) – but this variation is small relative to the
within-country variation in MRPK and MRPL. In Figure 2, we show the estimated dispersion in
MRPK (Panel A) and MRPL (Panel B) within countries, measured as the within-country standard
deviation in the logarithm of MRPK and MRPL, respectively. We present the dispersion in “raw”
marginal revenue products and in marginal revenue products adjusted for various groups of
observed characteristics (only variables 𝑿𝑿, variables 𝑿𝑿 plus country, industry and year fixed

effects, and variables 𝑿𝑿 plus country × industry × year fixed effects) in a cross-country regression

given by equation (4). As may be seen in Figure 3, the dispersion of MRPK and MRPL is highly
correlated at the country level, suggesting an important role of the 𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌 distortion in line with our

results above.

There is considerable dispersion in the raw MRPK and MRPL in both the more and less
advanced economies. Note that in Figure 3 the dispersion of raw marginal products is particularly high
in smaller countries such as Malta (MT), Luxembourg (LU) and Cyprus (CY). Among the larger
countries, Germany (DE) is the country with the lowest raw dispersion of marginal revenue products.
If one takes the view that some of the dispersion is due to compensating differentials rather
than distortions, then one may for instance start making cross-country comparisons by using the red
bars in Figure 2 (MRPK and MRPL adjusted for observed firm characteristics X, with no fixed effects
included). Although using X reduces the cross-sectional dispersion, it generally preserves the ranking
of the countries. Adding country, industry and year fixed effects further reduces the levels of
26

dispersion and the ranking of countries is generally preserved, although the ranking for some countries
jumps (e.g., Romania (RO) is similar to Slovenia (SI) in terms of “raw” MRPK dispersion, but after
this adjustment Romania becomes more similar to the Netherlands (NL)). Introducing country ×
industry × year fixed effects does not only reduce the level of dispersion, it also attenuates differences
across countries. For example, France and Italy have rather different dispersion of “raw” MRPK but
they have similar dispersion of MRPK after the adjustment is made for the controls and country ×
industry fixed effects. Depending on the interpretation, these results suggest either that removing
distortions can reduce cross-county differences in the allocation of capital and labor, and thus bring
about improvements in productivity, or that the observed cross-country differences in raw dispersions
are misleading and after adjusting for compensating differentials these differences become smaller.
The quantitative importance of country, industry and year fixed effects or the interaction
terms country × industry × year raises an important identification challenge. In particular, fixed
effects can absorb not only cross-country/industry compensating differentials related to the quality
of inputs, but also barriers to capital and/or labor flows across countries and industries. While it is
beyond the scope of this paper to resolve this identification problem, we can provide some leads
for discussion and future research.
In Table 5 we report R2 for regression (4) with various sets of fixed effects and no controls
𝑿𝑿.26 Country fixed effects alone account for R2 = 0.052 for MRPK and R2 = 0.445 for MRPL.

Industry (2-digit NACE level) fixed effects alone account for R2 = 0.239 for MRPK and R2 = 0.268

for MRPL. Time fixed effects have little explanatory power. The combined contribution of country,
industry and year fixed effects in column 5 is R2 = 0.275 for MRPK and R2 = 0.611 for MRPL. To
the extent that fixed effects embody distortions or compensating differentials common to countries
or industries, these patterns suggest (for MRPL) either that moving a worker from one country to
another is “costlier” than moving the worker from one industry to another – that is, countries are
more segmented than industries and therefore differences in levels of MRPL are higher across
countries than across industries and these differences are reflected in fixed effects – or that quality
differences across workers are larger between countries than between industries. Indeed, the R2 in
the regression with country, industry and year fixed effects is similar to the R2 with country fixed
effects only, which suggests that industry is not likely to be the main driver of MRPL dispersion

26

Appendix Table A.9 reports results based on “between” regressions that are qualitatively similar to our main
specification.

27

across countries. This is also consistent with empirical evidence that labor supply to an industry is
more elastic than to a country.
On the other hand, for capital the increment in the R2 with country, industry and year fixed
effects relative to the regression with no fixed effect is approximately equal to the sum of R2
increments in the regression with country fixed effects and in regression with industry fixed effects
relative to the regression with no fixed effects. Since the increment is somewhat larger for the
regression with the industry fixed effect than country fixed effect, the interpretation is that moving a
unit of capital from one country to another is “cheaper/easier” than moving it from one industry to
another, or that quality differences in capital are smaller between countries than between industries.
Finally, there is a large increase in the R2 when we introduce country × industry × year fixed
effects: R2 is 0.492 for MRPK and 0.736 for MRPL (column 6 of Table 5). Again, these results are
consistent with two explanations. The first one is that there is an additional barrier to move a
worker or a unit of capital across countries and industries relative to moving a worker or a unit of
capital across countries but within an industry or across industries within a country. The alternative
explanation is that there is an additional quality difference when workers or capital are compared
across industries and countries. Irrespective of which view is taken, it is clear that there are
quantitatively important complementarities in industry and country attributes.
If one interprets country and/or industry fixed effects as capturing barriers and distortions,
then the EU is rather fragmented economically. This interpretation suggests that the EU can
achieve considerable gains in productivity. For example, removing inequality in average marginal
revenue products across countries (i.e., making the country fixed effects be all identical) could
raise productivity by 102 percentage log points (row 4, column 1 of Table 5) according to the
Hsieh-Klenow framework (equation (3’)). Removing barriers between industries and countries
could raise productivity by at least 143 percentage log points (row 4, column 5 of Table 5).
What set of estimates should one use to compute the cost of inadequately integrated
Europe? In an ideal case, marginal revenue products should be equalized across countries and
industries. However, achieving this objective may be infeasible. For example, industries may have
a variety of idiosyncratic factors that could prevent equalization. As a result, one may propose a
weaker goal: equalize marginal returns across countries. In our context, this means that one should
focus on the case where we control only for industry fixed effects, i.e., within-industry marginal
revenue products should be similar in “Germany” and “Greece”. With this logic, the productivity
28

cost of inadequately integrated Europe is approximately 31 percent if we use only “distortions”
variables (row 35, column 3 in Table 4) and approximately 53 percent if we interpret all variables
as measuring frictions (row 36, column 3, in Table 4).

D. MACHADO-MATA DECOMPOSITION
While our analysis so far is helpful for understanding what factors can predict MRPK and MRPL,
it is also useful to understand whether the cross-country differences in dispersion are brought about
by differences in firm characteristics or by the way how these characteristics are translated into
differences in marginal revenue products. To address this question, we carry out a Machado and
Mata (2005) decomposition of the variance in MRPK and MRPL.27 We start by using Germany
and Greece as two polar cases: 𝜎𝜎(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)) is 0.92 for Germany and 1.64 for Greece, while

𝜎𝜎(log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀)) is 0.61 for Germany and 0.91 for Greece. We decompose the distributions of
MRPK and MRPL, respectively, into effects that are due to the values of the explanatory variables

𝑿𝑿 (“endowments”) and effects that are due to the coefficients 𝒃𝒃 (“prices”) on these variables. This

predictive (not causal) decomposition permits us to assess whether the cross-country differences

in the dispersion of marginal revenue products are due to differences in endowments of observed
firm characteristics 𝑿𝑿 or to how the business environment, institutions and policies translate
(“price”) these characteristics via 𝒃𝒃 into outcomes.

In Figure 4, we depict the distribution of Greek MRPK in Panel A and Greek MRPL in Panel

B. In each panel, we show the actual distribution using Greek X and b (solid black line), as well as a
counterfactual distribution using Greek X and German b (long-dash, blue line) and a counterfactual
distribution using German X and Greek b (short-dash, red line). Using Greek X and German b results
in a less dispersed distribution of both MRPK and MRPL, suggesting that German business,
This decomposition is implemented as in Gorodnichenko and Sabirianova Peter (2007). For country 𝑐𝑐 we make B
= 10,000 independent random draws (with replacement) from the distribution of firm characteristics 𝑋𝑋 so that we
generate samples {𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 }𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏=1. We also make 𝐵𝐵 independent random draws (with replacement) from the distribution of
quantile regressions 𝑄𝑄𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 (log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )|𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 estimated for each country 𝑐𝑐 and quantile 𝜃𝜃 separately. Thus,
we obtain {𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 }𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏=1 . Coefficients 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 can be interpreted as prices for observable characteristics of firms. Machado and
Mata (2005) show that the generated sequence {𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 }𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏=1 reproduces the distribution of the original series of
log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ). We can also combine {𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 }𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏=1 for country 𝑐𝑐 with {𝛾𝛾𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 }𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏=1 for country 𝑑𝑑 to construct a counterfactual
distribution of log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) if observables from country 𝑐𝑐 were priced as in country 𝑑𝑑. Since the number of firms per
industry is relatively small for any given country, we use 1-digit NACE industry fixed effects rather than 2-digit
industry fixed effects as in Table 3. Note that in these decompositions we only use the variation due to observable
characteristics, that is, we do not use unexplained (“residual”) variation. Thus, when we report dispersion for country
𝑐𝑐, we report {𝑋𝑋𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 }𝐵𝐵𝑏𝑏=1 . Because we have many countries in the sample, we report estimates of specification (4) for
three blocs of EU countries (North/West, South, Center/East) in Appendix Tables A.10, A.11, A.12. Marginal R2 and
welfare calculations for the blocs are reported in Appendix Tables A.13-A.16.

institutional and policy environment would increase the efficiency of Greek firms by reducing the
dispersion of marginal products of capital and labor across firms. In other words, German “prices”
help increase the equalization of returns across firms. Indeed, the standard deviation of this
counterfactual distribution is much closer to the actual distribution of marginal revenue products in
Germany (e.g., for MRPK the counterfactual standard deviation for Greece is 0.94 rather than 1.66).
When we use German X and Greek b, the distribution of MRPK is more dispersed and
shifts to the right. The latter is consistent with German firms having characteristics associated with
high levels of productivity. The former suggests that the dispersion of firm characteristics in
Germany is greater than the corresponding dispersion in Greece which, when combined with the
Greek business, institutional and policy environment (“prices”), results in a wider dispersion of
marginal products than is actually observed in Greece. Interestingly, using German X and Greek
b does not generate large differences in the mean or dispersion of MRPL. This pattern suggests
that differences in firm characteristics are not likely to be a key determinant of the differences in
the dispersion of MRPL between Germany and Greece. In contrast, using German b with Greek X
not only reduces dispersion of MRPL but also increases the mean value of MRPL.
Our decomposition exercise suggests that German business, institutional and policy
environment is the main reason for the smaller dispersion of marginal revenue products in
Germany relative to Greece. We generalize this result by showing in Table 6 for each EU country
the standard deviation of MRPK and MRPL when we use the country’s own X and b (column 1)
as compared to using (a) German X or b (columns 2 or 3 for MRPK and columns 7 or 8 for MRPL)
and (b) Greek X or b (columns 4 or 5 for MRPK and columns 9 or 10 for MRPL). We find that
using German b tends to reduce the dispersion of MRPK for most countries, while using German
X tends to increase it. This suggests that relative to other countries Germany has more diverse firm
characteristics but the business, institutional and policy environment is relatively effective in
ensuring that marginal returns are not very different across firms. In contrast, other countries have
relatively more homogenous firm characteristics or, at least, have more homogeneity for
characteristics with large variation in “prices” (that is, steep slopes in 𝑿𝑿). Core EU countries, such
as France and Denmark, exhibit relatively little sensitivity to using German 𝑿𝑿 or b, while countries

of the EU periphery, such as Portugal and Ireland, show relatively large movements in the
counterfactual dispersions of marginal revenue products.

30

As may also be seen in Table 6, when we combine Greek b with X for a given country, the
counterfactual distributions tend to increase considerably, as they did in the Germany and Greece
comparison. Similarly, using Greek X with b for a given country tends to increase (but to a smaller
extent) the dispersion of marginal revenue products across firms. These results suggest that the Greek
business, policy and institutional environment would be relatively ineffective in reducing the
dispersion of marginal returns across firms.28

VI.

Concluding remarks

Misallocation of resources is often seen as an important reason for the slowdown in productivity
growth in Europe, the Unites States and other advanced economies. Using data from the unique
EIB Investment Survey (EIBIS) of firms in the 28 EU countries, we go beyond existing studies by
using firm-level data to explain why there is variation in marginal revenue products. In addition to
presenting new cross-country evidence on allocation of resources, we propose a novel approach to
quantify potential productivity gains from better allocations. This approach does not rely on
exogenous variation in measured frictions (or compensating differentials) so that researchers can
apply it in a wide range of settings.
Using a simple dynamic theoretical framework as a guide, we find that there is a sizable
dispersion of marginal products across the firms in our sample. If one would consider the 28 EU
countries as a single market, where marginal products ought to be equalized, then the current state
of Europe is very far from that. Our calculations suggest that by removing frictions in the EU could
increase EU productivity by more than 40 percent. Thus, we find large costs of “inadequately
integrated Europe” induced by frictions and distortions related to incomplete integration of the EU
single market, which still persist 26 years after its inception.
Much of the overall dispersion in marginal products could be attributed to fixed differences
among countries or sectors/industries. For example, if one would remove the dispersion in marginal
products across countries (i.e., make the country fixed effects in the regression analysis all identical),
EU productivity could rise by 102 percentage log points. We also find that the significant association
between marginal products and firm characteristics is predominantly driven by variables measuring

28

Consistent with this interpretation and evidence in Figure 1, we find that gains from reduced dispersion of marginal
revenue products (measured as 𝜎𝜎(𝒃𝒃𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑿𝑿𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 )/𝜎𝜎(𝒃𝒃𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑿𝑿𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 )) are correlated with popular measures of institutional
quality such as World Bank’s Governance Indicators and the International Country Risk Guide: countries with lower
quality of institutions having greater gains from “importing” German institutions.

31

firm demographics, quality of inputs, utilization of resources, and dynamic adjustment of inputs. In
contrast, the contribution of direct measures of “barriers and constraints” to cross-sectional variation
in MRPK and MRPL seems to be modest. Finally, we show that cross-country variation in the withincountry dispersion of marginal revenue products is largely rationalized by differences in how a
country’s business, institutional and policy environment translates firm characteristics into outcomes
than by differences in firm characteristics per se.
Our work contributes to the growing literature measuring misallocation of resources,
provides new insights into the nascent literature on the sources of the observed dispersion in
marginal products, documents that various firm characteristics and measures of distortions have
predictive power for marginal revenue products, contributes to recent efforts to assess the
importance of measurement errors in observed marginal products, and relates a large literature on
the dispersion of earnings across workers to the studies of the dispersion of marginal products
across firms. Future research should make progress by further combining administrative and
survey data to reduce measurement errors, generate direct measures of distortions and
compensating differentials, and improve identification of causal effects.

Note: The table reports change in R2 in equation (4) when a group of variables is added to a specification with a given combination of
industry and/or country and/or year fixed effects. Industries are defined at 2-digit NACE level. All estimates are based on Huber robust
regression. Observations are weighted so that the sample represents the population in terms of employment. Standard errors are clustered
by industry and country. The group “compensating differentials” includes “quality of capital”, “capacity utilization” and “adjustment”.
The group “distortions” includes “demographics,”, “obstacles for investment” and “source of funds”. Productivity gain is computed
according to equation (3’).

Note: The table reports estimates of equation (4) with country × industry × year fixed effects. Industries are defined at 2-digit NACE
level. All estimates are based on Huber robust regression. Observations are weighted so that the sample represents the population in
terms of employment. Standard errors are clustered by industry and country. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10
percent levels.

Note: The table reports estimates of equation (4) with country × industry × year fixed effects. Industries are defined at 2-digit NACE level. All estimates
are based on Huber robust regression. Observations are weighted so that the sample represents the population in terms of employment. Investment is
measured as an indicator variable equal to one if a firm reports positive investment, and zero otherwise (the baseline specification uses log(1+investment)).
Standard errors are clustered by industry and country. ***, **, * denote statistical significance at 1, 5 and 10 percent levels.

Production function: 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖

where 𝑖𝑖 indexes firms (we skip time index to simplify notation), 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 is output of firm 𝑖𝑖, 𝑌𝑌 is aggregate output,𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 is the price
of firm 𝑖𝑖’s output, 𝑃𝑃 is the price index, 𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖 is capital, 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖 is labor, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is materials (intermediate input), 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 is productivity,
𝜏𝜏 𝑌𝑌 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐾𝐾 , 𝜏𝜏 𝐿𝐿 , 𝜏𝜏 𝑋𝑋 are distortions in product and input market (no distortion corresponds to 𝜏𝜏 = 1).
Aggregate demand is given by the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator:

APPROXIMATION TO AGGREGATE PRODUCTIVITY

Hsieh and Klenow (2009) assume log-normal distribution of firm-specific variables 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐾𝐾 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑋𝑋 . We can use this
assumption to derive exact formulae for output lost due to frictions 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐾𝐾 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 , 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑋𝑋 . Assume that each of these variables are
distributed independently (zero covariance):
log 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴 , 𝑉𝑉𝐴𝐴 )
log 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑌𝑌 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 )
log 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐾𝐾 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 )
log 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 )
log 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑋𝑋 ~𝑁𝑁(0, 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 )
Consider the aggregate price level:

to impose an identifying assumption.
The Hsieh-Klenow framework assumes that 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 = 1 for all 𝑖𝑖 and hence, one can find

Note that we do not have materials in the EIBIS. Is this a problem? The answer is not necessarily. We know that 𝑉𝑉𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏 ≥ 0
and hence a distortion in the intermediate input market will lower aggregate TFP. If we do not observe 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, we likely
understate the effect of the distortions and thus our estimate is conservative.

In the same spirit, 𝜔𝜔 = 𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠 𝑋𝑋 . We use these expressions to replace 𝛽𝛽, 𝛼𝛼, and 𝜔𝜔 in the expressions for marginal
revenue products to obtain

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (1 − 𝜎𝜎 −1 )𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠 𝐾𝐾
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = (1 − 𝜎𝜎 −1 )𝛾𝛾𝑠𝑠 𝐿𝐿

given that the share of pure economic profit in total revenue 𝑠𝑠𝜋𝜋 is approximately zero in the data (e.g., Basu and

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ≈ 𝑠𝑠 𝐾𝐾

Weaker assumptions may suffice. For example, to study a cross-sectional dispersion of marginal revenue products, it is enough to
have 𝛾𝛾/𝜇𝜇 constant across industries and countries. If even this assumption is not satisfied, one ought to consider using country and/or
industry fixed effects to control for the variation in market power and in returns to scale.

Section B. Quality adjustment for capital
Although it is conventional to define marginal products for physical units (e.g., number of employees and/or hours
worked), capital is typically measured in dollars such as the replacement value of capital or the book value of
fixed assets. In other words, in a typical survey (including our survey) we measure

where 𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a measure of the capital price used in constructing the replacement value or the balance sheet value of

fixed assets. In the case of replacement value of capital, we may have 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) ≈ 𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 . With the balance sheet value
of fixed asset, 𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 likely reflects the historical price rather than the current market price. Given technical change and

inflation, the difference between the market and historical prices can be large, especially for assets that were acquired

a long time ago (e.g., buildings).
For example, suppose that capital is bought at time 𝑡𝑡0 and, for simplicity that capital also does not depreciate,

so that the balance sheet value is 𝑝𝑝𝜏𝜏 𝐾𝐾𝜏𝜏 at the time of purchase. 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡0 𝐾𝐾𝑡𝑡0 is also the balance-sheet value of fixed assets.

The market price of capital at time 𝑡𝑡 is given by 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡0 �𝐴𝐴 �

If Π > 𝐴𝐴, a large share of state-of-the-art capital means a lower 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀

of fixed assets. With depreciation, we obtain similar results but in this case the outcome also depends on whether
the book value of capital depreciates faster on paper or de facto.
We are fortunate to have proxy information that enables us to try to correct for this effect. In particular, from
EIBIS we know the share of capital (including machinery, equipment and ICT) that the management considers to
be “state-of-the-art”, which presumably means capital that has been obtained recently. Thus, for firms with a large
share of state-of-the-art capital we can expect 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) ≈ 𝑅𝑅�𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

Appendix D: R2 for OLS vs. Instrumental Variables

85

Appendix D derives and compares 𝑅𝑅 2 for ordinary least squares (OLS) and instrumental variable (IV)
estimators under various assumptions.

A. Structural model

Consider the following system:
𝑦𝑦 = 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 + 𝑢𝑢

(D.1)

𝑥𝑥 = 𝑧𝑧 + 𝑒𝑒

(D.2)

where 𝑧𝑧 is an instrumental variable (without loss of generality we can assume that the coefficient on 𝑧𝑧 is equal to
one; we can always normalize z so that this is the case), 𝑦𝑦 is an outcome variable, 𝑥𝑥 is a (potentially endogenous)
regressor, 𝑢𝑢 and 𝑒𝑒 are error terms which could be correlated (𝑥𝑥 is endogenous) or uncorrelated (𝑥𝑥 is exogenous).
We assume that 𝑧𝑧 is a valid instrument and is uncorrelated with 𝑒𝑒 and 𝑢𝑢.

B. OLS

When we run an OLS regression for equation (D.1), we find that R2 is given by
2
≡1−
𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝐿𝐿𝑆𝑆

�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 )
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢

(D.3)

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑦𝑦)

where 𝑢𝑢�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 is the residual of the regression. Note that by construction of OLS regression we have
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑦𝑦) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝛼𝛼�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑥𝑥) + 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 )

(D.4)

and so it does not matter whether we use equation (D.3) to compute R2 or instead we use

(D.7)

Thus, OLS understates the variance of the error term and so OLS will inflate R2: 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ) < 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢).

86

Also notice that 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑥𝑥, 𝑢𝑢) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑧𝑧 + 𝑒𝑒, 𝑢𝑢) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑒𝑒, 𝑢𝑢) and so we can alternatively write
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢) −

[𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑢𝑢,𝑒𝑒)]2

(D.7’)

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑥𝑥)

C. Instrumental variables (IV)

Now consider the IV regression where the first stage is given by equation (D.2). In this case, we can show that
we can recover a consistent estimate of 𝛼𝛼. In this case, we can compute the structural error term in equation (1)
as
𝑢𝑢�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝛼𝛼�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑥𝑥

(D.8)

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢).

(D.9)

Because the estimate is consistent, we have also the correct estimate of the variance of the error term 𝑢𝑢 as the
sample size increases to infinity:

If 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑢𝑢, 𝑥𝑥) = 0 (or equivalently 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑒𝑒, 𝑢𝑢) = 0), we have 𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
= 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
. However, notice that with the IV
regression we can no longer use equations (3) and (5) equivalently because:

D. Predictive error

To address this issue, Pesaran and Smith (1994) propose using predictive error in IV regressions to do model
comparisons and model selection. In contrast to structural errors, these errors can be used for model selections
because they have a well-defined measure of fit: generalized R2 (or GR2) which is calculated as follows
𝑢𝑢�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝛼𝛼�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑥𝑥�

(D.13)

where 𝑥𝑥� is the predicted value of 𝑥𝑥 in the first-stage regression (D.2). Effectively, computing this residual amounts
to regressing 𝑦𝑦 on 𝑧𝑧, i.e., running a reduced-form regression. In this case, because 𝑧𝑧 is uncorrelated with 𝑒𝑒 or 𝑢𝑢,
we have
2
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑦𝑦) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝛼𝛼�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑧𝑧 + 𝑢𝑢) = 𝛼𝛼�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑧𝑧) + 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢)

(D.14)

What is the relation of 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 ) to 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 )? Using the logic of equation (D.7) and the fact that 𝛼𝛼�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 →𝑝𝑝 𝛼𝛼,
we can find
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑦𝑦 − 𝛼𝛼�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑥𝑥�) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑦𝑦 − 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣�𝑦𝑦 − 𝛼𝛼(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑒𝑒)�
= 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣�𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 + 𝑢𝑢 − 𝛼𝛼(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑒𝑒)� = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢 + 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼)
= 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢) + 𝛼𝛼 2 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑒𝑒) + 2𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝑒𝑒, 𝑢𝑢)

(D.15)

The second term in equation (D.15) is positive (and so we push R2 down) but the third term is ambiguous: the
sign depends how 𝑥𝑥 influences 𝑦𝑦 (the sign of 𝛼𝛼) and how the error terms are correlated.

Now using equation (D.7’), we compute

𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ) − 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 ) = �𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝑢𝑢) −

The first two terms are negative (and so this helps us ensure that 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
is greater that 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
) but the last term is
ambiguous because we need to know more about the nature of the omitted variable that gives a non-zero
correlation between 𝑒𝑒 and 𝑢𝑢 as well as how 𝑥𝑥 influences 𝑦𝑦.

One special case to guarantee 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
(i.e., 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑢𝑢, 𝑒𝑒) > 0) as 𝑥𝑥 moves 𝑦𝑦. For example, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑢𝑢, 𝑒𝑒) > 0 and 𝛼𝛼 > 0. Alternatively, 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑢𝑢, 𝑒𝑒) < 0 and 𝛼𝛼 <
2
0. If 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝑒𝑒, 𝑢𝑢) ≥ 0, OLS overstates the contribution of 𝑥𝑥 to variable of 𝑦𝑦 and hence 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
continues to be an
upper bound for the variation in 𝑦𝑦 due to 𝑥𝑥.

One may expect condition 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝑒𝑒, 𝑢𝑢) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑥𝑥, 𝑢𝑢) ≥ 0 to be satisfied in our setting: more productive firms are
more likely to run into distortionary constraints (e.g., red tape) and these constraints are likely to raise the marginal
revenue product of an input (red tape makes firms employ too little of the input). Consider the following model
as an illustration of this point. Suppose that a firm is maximizing profits subject to a size constraint:
max 𝐴𝐴(𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸)𝛼𝛼 − 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸)𝐿𝐿 𝑠𝑠. 𝑡𝑡. 𝐿𝐿 ≤ 𝐿𝐿�
𝐸𝐸,𝐿𝐿

where 𝐿𝐿 is labor input, 𝐿𝐿� is the maximum firm size allowed by red tape, 𝐸𝐸 is effort of workers, 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸) is the wage
function for effort, 𝐴𝐴 is productivity (entrepreneurial talents of the firm’s manager). We will assume that the wage
function is increasing and convex: 𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸) > 0, 𝑤𝑤 ′′ (𝐸𝐸) > 0. The parameter 𝛼𝛼 < 1 measures returns to scale. Firms
are heterogenous in their draws of 𝐴𝐴.
The Lagrangian is ℒ = 𝐴𝐴(𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸)𝛼𝛼 − 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸)𝐿𝐿 − 𝜆𝜆(𝐿𝐿 − 𝐿𝐿�) where 𝜆𝜆 is the Lagrange multiplier on the size constraint.
Optimality conditions for 𝐸𝐸 and 𝐿𝐿 are respectively:
𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝐸𝐸 𝛼𝛼−1 𝐿𝐿𝛼𝛼 = 𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸)𝐿𝐿,

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ≡ 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼𝐸𝐸 𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿𝛼𝛼−1 = 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸) + 𝜆𝜆.

Note that when the size constraint is not binding, 𝜆𝜆 = 0 and hence the optimal level of effort 𝐸𝐸 ∗ is given by

88

𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ )𝐸𝐸 ∗
= 1.
𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸 ∗ )

and so effort does not depend on productivity 𝐴𝐴. If the size constraint is not binding, the marginal revenue product
of labor is
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸 ∗ ).

If the size constraint is binding, the optimal effort is given by
𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝐸𝐸

∗ )𝛼𝛼−1 �𝛼𝛼

𝐿𝐿 = 𝑤𝑤

′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ )𝐿𝐿
�

𝐿𝐿�1−𝛼𝛼 ′ ∗
⇔ 𝐴𝐴 =
𝑤𝑤 (𝐸𝐸 )(𝐸𝐸 ∗ )1−𝛼𝛼 .
𝛼𝛼

Because 𝑤𝑤 ′′ (𝐸𝐸) > 0 and 𝛼𝛼 < 1, it follows that 𝐸𝐸 ∗ is increasing in productivity 𝐴𝐴. To determine 𝜆𝜆 in this case,
we note that
𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼(𝐸𝐸 ∗ ) 𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿�𝛼𝛼−1 = 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸 ∗ ) + 𝜆𝜆 ⟹ 𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ )𝐸𝐸 ∗ = 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸 ∗ ) + 𝜆𝜆 ⟹ 𝜆𝜆 = 𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ )𝐸𝐸 ∗ − 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸 ∗ )

Given our assumptions about the wage function, we have

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
= 𝑤𝑤 ′′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ )𝐸𝐸 ∗ + 𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ ) − 𝑤𝑤 ′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ ) = 𝑤𝑤 ′′ (𝐸𝐸 ∗ )𝐸𝐸 ∗ > 0,
𝜕𝜕𝐸𝐸 ∗

that is, the Lagrange multiplier on the size constraint is increasing in effort. Trivially, 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 is increasing in
effort.
Now suppose we have a measure of how binding the size constraint is (e.g., in the survey, we ask firms to report
how binding various constraints are: major issue, minor issue, not an issue) but we do not observe effort. We
regress 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 on 𝜆𝜆. The optimality condition for labor implies that the regression takes the following form:
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 𝜆𝜆 + 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸) = 𝜆𝜆 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒,

where the error term 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 absorbs unobserved effort 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸). Clearly the structural coefficient on 𝜆𝜆 is positive
2
2

2
and 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝜆𝜆, 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒) = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐�𝜆𝜆, 𝑤𝑤(𝐸𝐸)� > 0. Thus, the condition for 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
≥ 𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
and 𝑅𝑅𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂
≥ 𝐺𝐺𝑅𝑅𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
is satisfied.

E. Measurement error

Suppose we do not have the right measure of 𝑥𝑥 and instead have two imperfect measures of 𝑥𝑥: 𝑥𝑥1∗ = 𝑥𝑥 + 𝜂𝜂1 and
𝑥𝑥2∗ = 𝑥𝑥 + 𝜂𝜂2 . To keep algebra simple, we assume that:
1) 𝜂𝜂 is uncorrelated with 𝑢𝑢 and 𝑒𝑒
2) 𝜂𝜂1 is uncorrelated with 𝜂𝜂2 .
3) 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜂𝜂1 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜂𝜂2 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(𝜂𝜂)

Also, to focus on the measurement error, we assume that 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐(𝑢𝑢, 𝑒𝑒) = 0 and so we do not have endogeneity
considered above.
Using 𝑥𝑥1∗ (or 𝑥𝑥2∗ ) in estimating equation (D.1) yields
