How's Life at Home? New Evidence on Marriage and the Set Point for Happiness

ABSTRACT
Subjective well-being research has often found that marriage is positively correlated with well-being.
Some have argued that this correlation may be result of happier people being more likely to marry.
Others have presented evidence suggesting that the well-being benefits of marriage are short-lasting.
Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we control individual pre-marital well-being
levels and find that the married are still more satisfied, suggesting a causal effect, even after full allowance
is made for selection effects. Using new data from the United Kingdom's Annual Population Survey,
we find that the married have a less deep U-shape in life satisfaction across age groups than do the
unmarried, indicating that marriage may help ease the causes of the mid-life dip in life satisfaction
and that the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived. We explore friendship as a mechanism
which could help explain a causal relationship between marriage and life satisfaction, and find that
well-being effects of marriage are about twice as large for those whose spouse is also their best friend.
Finally, we use the Gallup World Poll to show that although the overall well-being effects of marriage
appear to vary across cultural contexts, marriage eases the middle-age dip in life evaluations for all
regions except Sub-Saharan Africa.

Introduction
The decision of whether and who to marry is one of the most important that people make.
People typically enter into marriage with the expectation that their marriage and their relationship with
their spouse will make their lives richer and more satisfying. To test whether the decision to marry
actually makes people’s lives more satisfying, we rely on individuals’ assessments of the quality of
their own lives. We follow most other research in using life evaluations, rather than measures of current
emotions, because these evaluations have been found to be more reliably based on life circumstances.
There are three main types of life evaluation collected: satisfaction with life as a whole (SWL),
happiness with life as a whole, and the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to think of their lives as a
ladder, with the best possible life as a 10, and the worst as a 0, and then to evaluate their current lives
on this scale. The Cantril ladder, by design, tends to produce lower average scores, at the population
level, than either of the other measures, with the means of the other two measures being quite close
together, when asked on the same scale of the same respondents. Despite these differences in mean
values, all three measures deliver structurally equivalent information about the relative importance of
the various factors that have been found to be linked to subjective well-being1.
Most studies have found that marriage is positively associated with life satisfaction2, although
most of these studies have been conducted in western, educated, industrialized, and rich democracies3,
and as discussed later in this paper, there are indications that these results may not be generalizable to
the rest of the world. A positive correlation between marriage and life satisfaction is not in itself
sufficient to show that someone who marries is more satisfied with their life than they would have been
had they remained single. To draw a causal connection, we must remove or otherwise account for
influences in the reverse direction or coming from some third factor. Those who marry tend to be more

social, healthier, better educated and have more engaging jobs, all features of life likely to increase
happiness with or without marriage. And there is lots of evidence that happier people tend to attract
more friends and potential partners. While we can control for observable traits that we know are
associated with well-being and marital status, it would also be useful to allow for personality
differences and other unobserved factors that might increase the chances of marriage and of happiness
through different channels. A primary contribution of this paper is to use panel data to directly control
for pre-marital well-being levels to try to provide a secure estimate of the impact of marriage,
excluding the impact of other factors that help to explain why (in some populations) married people are
on average happier than those are not married.
This paper also looks again at whether marriage provides evidence for or against the set point
theory of happiness. Some previous papers have argued that marriage boosts well-being only in the few
years immediately before and immediately after the wedding. This paper tests these claims by looking
at how the difference between the married and unmarried changes with age and the duration of
marriage. We also discuss why the use of individual fixed effects in panel data could suggest full
adaptation where in fact there are continuing happiness effects.
There are many possible mechanisms that could explain why marriage might have a causal
effect on well-being. For instance, Becker (1974) showed the possibility of marriage increasing utility
of both partners through complementarity of inputs in household production. As marriage has evolved
over time and women's share of the labour market has increased, the model of marriage where one
spouse works and the other attends to children seems to be less relevant to many modern households.
An important role that a spouse continues to play in a successful marriage is that of a close friend and
confidant; however, only one previous paper has, to our knowledge, estimated the extent to which
friendship can condition the well-being benefits of marriage. This paper explicitly tests whether those
who have a closer friendship with their spouse get more well-being gains from marriage than those who
do not.

Literature Review
Although the cross-sectional correlation between marriage and well-being is well-established, at
least in certain cultural contexts, some researchers have contested the causal effect. Stutzer and Frey
(2006) found that “if singles at the age of 20 are asked about their satisfaction with life, the well-being
of those who will get married later is higher than of those who will stay single throughout their life”4,
although the authors also acknowledge that “it is unlikely that these selection effects can explain the
entire difference in well-being between singles and married people”5.
A further question is whether the benefits of marriage are short-lived or long-lasting. Brickman
and Campbell (1971) introduced the idea of a hedonic treadmill – the notion that people adapt to their
sensory experiences and revert to a set-point level of well-being. Proponents of adaptation point to the
relative stability of subjective well-being over time, the partial heritability of well-being and the ability
of personality variables such as extroversion and neuroticism to predict well-being6.
Lucas et al (2003) analyzed the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) and concluded
that the set point theory applies to marriage because they found that married individuals have a higher
pre-marital happiness baseline than those who will remain unmarried and have further increased wellbeing around the time of their marriage but that their subsequent well-being reverts to their pre-marital
baseline after a few years.
Soons, Liefbroer and Kalmijn (2009) offered four theoretical reasons why people in fact may
not adapt to the well-being effects of marriage as readily as they adapt to most events: partner-related
resources can manifest themselves in diverse ways, the importance of a partner varies as new situations
and challenges arise in one's life, repeated downward comparisons when meeting single people in
accordance with downward comparison theory and a partner is a “unique resource provider, who

cannot be replaced easily by other people.”7
The notion of adaptation requires identifying a baseline to which individuals will revert. Many
studies that find adaptation use the pre-marital (or pre-relationship) level of well-being as the baseline.
This approach implicitly assumes that had the marital event not occurred, the well-being would have
remained at “baseline” for the entire duration. However, Blanchflower and Oswald (2008) found that
well-being follows a U-shape in age. The authors found that well-being falls through early adulthood
until it reaches a minimum (typically in the late 40s but varying across countries) and then rises after
that minimum. Thus, as well-being is changing ceteris paribus with age, pre-marital well-being levels
do not provide an appropriate counterfactual baseline to represent what the individuals’ well-being
would have been had they not married.
Zimmermann and Easterlin (2006) analyzed the GSOEP and found that when allowing age to
vary “individuals who remain married two or more years do not revert to their baseline value before
marriage”8. The authors' reason as to why their results differ from Lucas et al (2003) was due to “their
[Lucas et al] failure to treat age as varying with time, and thus to control for life circumstances that
affect life satisfaction negatively”9.
Yap, Anusic & Lucas (2012) used a propensity score matching method to match unmarried
individuals who would go on to be married to similar individuals who would remain unmarried for the
duration of the sample and found that while the well-being of the married sample rose around the time
of their marriage and then fell, the well-being of the unmarried sample fell during the entire period.
This finding is consistent with the U-shape in age as most people marry in their 20s and 30s when wellbeing is generally in decline. Thus, this finding can reconcile why married individuals simultaneously
revert to their premarital baseline and maintain a well-being advantage over their peers who remain

unmarried. The authors found similar results to hold in Switzerland10 and Australia11.
Clark and Georgellis (2013) used the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to show that
married people are more satisfied in the years immediately before and immediately after their marriage,
but that marriage had a negligible effect for individuals who had been married for at least five years.
The authors used individual fixed effects in the panel in an attempt to control for unobserved selection
differences between the married and unmarried which are not caused by their marital status. However,
given that only twelve waves of the BHPS have life satisfaction data, there is limited variation of
marital status across survey waves. Thus, as will be discussed later in this paper, the use of individual
fixed effects is likely to have excessively depressed the estimated long-term well-being effects of
marriage.
Qari (2014) used the GSOEP to show that the adaptation result is sensitive to the baseline
period used. Qari found that “using five years prior to marriage as the relevant baseline year allows us
to calculate utility while single more accurately. If we – instead of this – use 1–2 years prior to
marriage as the reference category, the same sample generates evidence of complete “adaptation” as in
previous longitudinal studies”12. Thus, when analyzing the panel data results in the BHPS, we must be
careful as to what baseline we choose, noting that using individual fixed effects will be implicitly
choosing a baseline equivalent to the within-sample pre-marital years for those who eventually became
married. If this time period is too short, as we find to be the case with the BHPS life satisfaction data,
then the baseline could be contaminated by the happy period during which friendship with the eventual
marriage partner is being developed and enjoyed.
To implement our exploration of friendship as a possible mediating factor to help explain why
the married would be more satisfied than the unmarried, it must first be established that friendship
matters for well-being. Similar to marriage, there is a risk of reverse causation – that more satisfied

people are more likely to develop and sustain friendships. Using the BHPS and individual fixed effects,
Powdthavee (2008) found that “a move from “seeing friends or relatives less than once a month” to
“seeing friends or relatives on most days” is now estimated to be worth an extra £85,000 a year for a
representative individual”13.
If marriage affects well-being through friendship, then we would expect that friendship and
marriage could be substitutes and that friendship would be more important for the unmarried than the
married, as the married would have much of their friendship needs met through their spouse. Helliwell
and Huang (2013) found that “the estimated contribution of having more than more than 30 friends is
0.72 in the un-married/partnered sample; the standard error is 0.18. In contrast, the estimated
contribution is only 0.14 for people who are married or in a common-law partnership; the standard
error is 0.14. There is thus no overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two estimates”14. This
paper explores whether the closeness of friendship with one's partner affects the well-being benefit of
the marriage.
Data and Summary Statistics
This paper uses three data sets: the United Kingdom's Annual Population Survey (APS), the
British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Gallup World Poll (GWP).
The APS is a cross-sectional dataset with 328,665 observations collected between May 2011
and April 2013 in the United Kingdom. The APS data set has four relevant well-being measures: life
satisfaction, worthwhileness, anxiety and happiness. This paper focuses on the life satisfaction
measure, where respondents are asked “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?” Each
well-being measure is measured on a 0-10 scale. Table 1 summarizes the key demographics15, wellbeing measures and marital statuses in the APS dataset.
The BHPS is a panel data set with 18 waves, collected from 1991 to 2009 in the United

Kingdom. The BHPS' principal well-being measure is overall life satisfaction, where respondents are
asked “How dissatisfied or satisfied are you with your life overall” and scores are measured on a 1-7
scale. The BHPS has overall life satisfaction only for Waves 6-10 and 12-18, thus these waves will be
the principal focus of this paper's analysis. Overall, the BHPS surveyed approximately 30,000
individuals; however, not all respondents completed all waves. There are only 5,337 respondents for
whom we have life satisfaction scores for both Wave 6 and Wave 18. Table 2 reports the summary
statistics for each of Wave 6 and Wave 18.
The GWP is a cross-country and cross-sectional dataset where observations were taken from
2005 to 2013. The life evaluation measure in the GWP is the Cantril ladder, which is slightly different
than life satisfaction. Respondents are asked “to evaluate the quality of their lives on an 11-point ladder
scale running from 0 to 10, with the bottom rung of the ladder (0) being the worst possible life for them
and 10 being the best possible”16. Table 3 reports the summary statistics for the GWP by region of the
world.
Causal Effect of Marriage
Those who are more satisfied with their life are more likely to get and stay married as happier
people may be more likely to enter into and maintain romantic relationships and previous research has
provided evidence for some reverse causation. Additionally, factors such as sociability, income,
education and health status are correlated and possibly even causally related to both well-being and
propensity to marry.
To provide a likely upper-bound estimate of the possible causal effects running from happiness
to marriage, we estimate the impact of life satisfaction ten periods ago on probability of marriage
considering only the population that was unmarried ten, nine and eight periods ago. We find that an
increase of one point on the life satisfaction scale is associated with an increase in probability of
marriage of 1.37%. This effect is significant at the 1% level. For perspective, the mean probability of
16 World Happiness Report (2012, 11)

someone unmarried in each of ten, nine and eight periods ago being married in the current period is
22.74%. This indicates that the selection effects found in papers such as Stutzer and Frey (2006) are
present in the BHPS data as well.
The existence of a selection effect does not preclude a true causal effect from marriage to life
satisfaction. To test whether the reverse causation can fully explain the life satisfaction difference
between the married and unmarried, we use the BHPS to regress life satisfaction on relationship status,
lagged life satisfaction from ten periods ago and other individual characteristics. Standard errors are
clustered at the level of the individual respondent. Model 1 in Table 4 below provides the coefficients
when no lagged life satisfaction is included. This is the relationship between marriage and life
satisfaction including any selection bias into marriage that is not captured by controlling for age, health
limitations and log income. Model 2 includes life satisfaction from ten waves ago as an independent
variable. If there are stable but unobserved pre-marital differences in circumstances and personality that
increase both happiness and marriage prospects, any resulting danger to the estimate of the effects of
marriage on happiness can be allowed for by including a baseline measure of each individual’s life
satisfaction at the beginning of the sample period. Any remaining effect should be attributable to the
effect of marriage.
Model 3 includes lagged life satisfaction and also includes the life satisfaction changes that
occurred between ten periods ago and nine periods ago and between nine periods and eight periods ago,
to capture any trends in life satisfaction that may have occurred prior to any potential marriage. Since
this sample restricts itself to only those who were unmarried eight periods ago, the life satisfaction
trend from ten periods ago to eight periods ago will likely capture some of the anticipatory benefits of
marriage for some people in the sample who will be married shortly after the trend ends eight periods
ago. This could explain why the marriage effect is slightly reduced in this specification, as any
anticipation effects captured in the trend would lower the estimated effect of marriage.
The inclusion of lagged life satisfaction as an independent variable lowers the coefficient on
8

being married slightly from 0.480 to 0.427 and the inclusion of the previous life satisfaction lowers the
coefficient to 0.347. In both cases, the effect still remains significant at the 0.1% level and the
difference between singles and those who are living as couple but unmarried is approximately threequarters of the difference between singles and married individuals. The inclusion of within-sample
changes in life satisfaction lowers the estimated effects of marriage, and perhaps excessively so, as
noted above. Hence the estimates including only the initial life satisfaction as a personality control are
probably more appropriate.
Model 4 is equivalent to Model 2 with the inclusion of the interaction term to cover the
difference between men and women in the well-being effect of marriage. This model shows that the life
satisfaction impact of marriage is 0.161 higher for females than males. This effect is significant at the
5% level.
The estimates of the average well-being effects of marriage may include some unhappy years
that precede separation and divorce. Thus, the long-term well-being difference between the nevermarried and those who stay married may be greater than the above would suggest.
Marriage and the U-shape in Age
If the benefits of marriage are fleeting and individuals return to their set-point level of wellbeing, we would expect that the difference between the married and unmarried would be greatest at
ages when many people of that age are recently married and much smaller at ages when fewer people
are getting married. Given that the median of age of marriage in the United Kingdom is approximately
30.8 for men and 28.9 for women17, adaptation theory would suggest that the difference between
married and unmarried should be the greatest in one's late 20's and 30's. But the cross-sectional
evidence from the UK Annual Population Survey rules out this possibility.
Figure 1 shows that the U-shape in marriage exists for both the married and unmarried but is
deeper for the unmarried. Figure 2 shows the difference between the married and unmarried by age

group, and we can see the difference between married and unmarried is greatest when people are in
their late 40s and 50s18.
We can also test whether the above result is driven by disproportionate selection out of
marriage, where people who are less satisfied with their lives will be more likely to divorce. This is
done in Figures 3 and 4, where we see similar results persist when we compare people who have ever
been married to people who have never been married, although, as would be expected, the difference
between the ever-married and the never-married is smaller than the difference between the married and
unmarried. Figure 5 shows the difference between married and unmarried over age by gender. Marriage
seems to be more important for women than men in middle ages, with the largest gap for those ages 51
to 55 where there is no overlap between the 95% confidence intervals.
One hypothesis that could explain why the U-shape in life satisfaction over age is deeper for the
unmarried than the married is that the social support provided by a spouse helps ease the stresses of
middle age. It has already been shown, although with US data, that the U-shape in age, for daily
measures of positive and negative affect, is smaller on weekends than of weekdays, and the
determinants of the additional weekend happiness are shown to relate to the social contexts both at
home and at work19. The U-shape difference for the married is likely to have a similar explanation,
although the BHPS does not have sufficient variables describing the social context to permit more
direct testing.
Why not Fixed Effects?
As noted in the literature review, Clark and Georgellis (2013) analyzed the relationship between
marriage and well-being in the BHPS using individual fixed effects. This approach makes intuitive
sense because we would expect that the fixed effect would eliminate any time-invariant unobservable

18 This is not a definitive rejection of full adaptation, as there could be a small group of people becoming married in middle
age who have a dramatic but temporary increase in life satisfaction or the selection effects between the married and
unmarried could be largest in middle age; however, we believe that is unlikely that these could explain the difference
between Figure 1 and what the adaptation theory would predict.
19 See Helliwell and Wang (2014, Table 6).

selection bias; and thus only the remaining estimated effect of marriage could be interpreted as causal.
However, this approach is problematic in the BHPS due to the relatively short duration of the dataset
and the large number of lags and leads included by Clark and Georgellis (2013).
The use of fixed effects in panel data with rarely varying regressors is problematic. Beck (2001)
noted this issue and said “although we can estimate [a model] with slowly changing independent
variables, the fixed effect will soak up most of the explanatory power of these slowly changing
variables. Thus, if a variable … changes over time, but slowly, the fixed effects will make it hard for
such variables to appear either substantively or statistically significant”20.
Plumper and Troeger (2007) noted that variables can be time-invariant either by definition or
because of the period or sample under analysis. The BHPS suffers from the latter problem as we only
have twelve years of life satisfaction data. Marital statuses typically do not differ much over short
periods of time. In the BHPS, 92.73% of people who were single in a period remained single in the
next period, 82.45% of people who were living as couple remained living as a couple in the next period
and 97.83% of people who were married remained married in the next period. Plumper and Troeger
(2007) proposed a method entitled fixed effects vector decomposition (FEVD) to deal with timeinvariant or rarely variant regressors and Boyce (2010) applied the method to life satisfaction and
marital status and found that the marriage benefit was nearly three times larger in a model using FEVD
rather than a model just using fixed effects. This suggests that the limited variance of marital status in
the panel data is a real problem with significantly large effects.
The anticipatory effects of marriage and the use of lags and leads make the relatively invariant
nature of the BHPS even more questionable. Clark and Georgellis (2013) used dummies for four
periods prior to marriage and five periods after marriage. Thus, the long-term effect of marriage, which
is the effect after five periods can be compared to the pre-marital baseline only if someone has been in
the sample for that entire period. This would require someone to have at least five unmarried periods
20 Beck (2001, 285)
11

and at least six married periods.
By running the panel regression with fixed effects, the estimated marriage effect is identified by
comparing to a baseline level of well-being, which includes whatever unmarried years the individual
has in the panel. The “all people” regression in Table 5 shows that using this specification and similar
lags and leads as employed by Clark and Georgellis (2013), that the long-term marriage effect for
people who have been married at least six years is approximately zero. However, if we shift the
baseline by only including individuals in the regression if they have at least five periods of a “never
married” status, then the long-term effect returns to being large and significant at the 5% level. We
believe that this is a more appropriate specification as failing to ensure that people have at least five
years to use a pre-marital baseline causes the anticipatory well-being effects of marriage and the
limitations of the BHPS to falsely drive down the estimated impact of marriage.
Friendship as a Mechanism
The potential mechanisms through which marriage could have a causal effect on well-being are
numerous. Ribar (2004) found that there is a wage differential between the married and unmarried21;
however, given that the estimations in the previous sections of this paper control for income, it is
unlikely that economic factors are a key part of the explanation for the well-being difference between
the married and unmarried.
The difference between how people perceive changeable versus unchangeable decisions may be
a mechanism to explain the higher well-being of the marriedd. Gilbert and Ebert (2002) experimentally
gave some participants photographs with the opportunity to change photographs at a later time and
some participants no opportunity to change their mind. They found that contrary to orthodox economic
theory, those “who had been given the opportunity to change their outcome were less likely to grow

21 Ribar (2004) provides five hypotheses as to why this wage differential exists: specialization of activities allowing one
partner to focus on market activities and one to focus on non-market activities, instrumental support of a partner's career
such as reviewing resumes and entertaining co-workers, marriage as a stabilizing or maturing influence, married
individuals may sacrifice amenities in a job for higher pay to support their family and market discrimination in favour of
married men compared to unmarried men.
12

relatively fond of it over the course of several days than were experiencers who had not been given that
opportunity, even though only one of the experiencers who had been given the opportunity chose to
exercise it”22. Gilbert proposed to his long-term girlfriend shortly after making this finding and he is
reported as having said “I love my wife more than I loved my girlfriend” due to the irrevocability of the
decision23. Gilbert and Ebert (2002) noted that the increased societal acceptability of divorce over the
20th century may alter this perception of irrevocability24.
However, for the purpose of this paper we focus on the mechanism of friendship and the social
relationship between spouses. Friendship could help explain why the benefits of marriage are not
subject to adaptation, as one's partner provides unique social support for each challenge one faces in
life. Additionally, friendship can help explain why people who are unmarried but living as a couple
enjoy most of the well-being benefits of marriage, especially if, as we find, their partner is also their
best friend.
If friendship explains much of the well-being benefits of marriage, then life satisfaction should
be higher for those whose spouses are also close friends. This is easily tested using the BHPS data,
since respondents are asked about their closest friendship, with spouse or partner being one of the
choices. Table 6 shows the distribution by relationship status in Wave 17 of the BHPS of whether an
individual lists their best friend as their partner or lists someone else as their best friend. Approximately
half of married people and of those who are cohabiting list their partner as their best friend and less
than five percent of people in any other marital status consider their partner to be their best friend25.
To test the impact of having a best friend as a partner, we regressed life satisfaction on
relationship status interacted with whether their partner is their best friend and standard controls and the
results are presented in Table 7. Given their small number and unusual status, those who are neither

There are differences by gender. Among the married, 53% of men and 43% of women respondents list their spouse as
their best friend. For the cohabiting unmarried, the percentages are 48% for men and 44% for women.
13

married nor cohabitating but whose partner is still their best friend are omitted from the analysis. Those
whose spouse or partner is also considered their best friend get almost twice as much additional life
satisfaction from marriage or cohabitation as do others26.
Figure 6 shows that married individuals whose spouse is their best friend have higher life
satisfaction than those who do not, even when controlling for age, gender, income and health
limitations, and the same results hold for those who are cohabiting. Figure 7 shows that the effect of
being best friends with one's spouse persists even when previous life satisfaction is controlled for.
Figure 8 shows the same specification as Figure 6, except with the sample divided by gender.
The well-being benefit of being married to one's best friend appears much higher for women than for
men, although on average fewer women than men regard their spouse as their best friend. Further
research is required to indicate how the friendship mechanism may differ for men and women or if
there are other factors driving this result.
Our finding that the happiness benefits of marriage flow largely through social channels, in
particular though friendship, has strong parallels to the results of by Lim and Putnam (2010) for the life
satisfaction effects of religion. They find that most or all of the SWB benefits of religious involvement
flow through the number of church friends, in particular those who share common values. The two
pieces of research taken together suggest that friendship is a strong mediating factor for the life
satisfaction consequences of two key life circumstances: marriage and religion. While all friends are
important for happiness, those who share who share beliefs (in the Lim and Putnam example) or are
married to each other (as in our results) are super-friends, with well-being effects apparently much
larger than for friends on average. Our results for the U-shape in age are also consistent with our
emphasis on the social context.

26

The impact of being best friends with one’s spouse was not significantly different for married individuals with and

International Results
Marriage is a social, cultural, religious and legal institution, with different meaning for different
individuals and different cultures. Therefore, the well-being effects of marriage found in this paper may
be specific to the cultural context of the participants of the dataset. Using the cross-sectional Gallup
World Poll, we use OLS by world region to determine the marriage effect on life evaluations by region
and Table 8 summarizes the results of this analysis.
We find that marriage is significantly positively related with life evaluations in Western Europe
(excluding the United Kingdom), United Kingdom, Central and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of
Independent States (including Russia), Australia-New Zealand, East Asia, North America and the
Middle East & North Africa. Marriage is significantly negatively associated with life evaluations in
Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. Marriage is not significantly associated with
life evaluations in the Southeast Asia and South Asia.
In Table 9, we add interaction effects between marriage and age to test whether the U-shape in
age persists across countries and whether marriage affects the middle-age dip globally in the same way
it does in the United Kingdom. Somewhat surprisingly, the results are remarkably consistent across
regions. With the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa, in each region, the U-shape over age exists for both
married and unmarried and is deeper for the unmarried. Appendix A shows the U-shape for each region
across age, by five-year age brackets27. We believe the most natural hypothesis is that the social
support provided by marriage is most important in middle-age and this social support is applicable, to
varying degrees, in all cultures.
Summary and Conclusions
This paper makes four key contributions. First, even when controlling for pre-marital life
satisfaction levels, those who marry are more satisfied than those who remain single. Second, contrary

to past papers claiming full adaptation, the benefits of marriage persist in the long-term, even if the
well-being benefits are greatest immediately after marriage. Third, marriage seems to be most
important in middle age when people of every marital status experience a dip in well-being. This result
seems to be applicable globally, even in regions of the world where the average effects of marriage are
not positive. Fourth, those who are best friends with their partners have the largest well-being benefits
from marriage and cohabitation, even when controlling for pre-marital well-being levels. The wellbeing benefits of marriage are on average about twice as large for those (about half of the sample)
whose spouse is also their best friend.
This paper provides evidence that the long-term benefits of marriage are substantial and worth
further exploration. The evidence in this paper helps to solidify the important case that changes in key
life circumstances have large and enduring consequences for life evaluations. These results combine
with the large international differences in average life evaluations (as shown in Table 3) to demonstrate
that life evaluations are not fully determined by genetic and other factors to define immutable longterm individual happiness set points28.

28

Although Cummins et al (2014) argue that set point theory can be reconciled with the idea that life circumstances have
long-term impacts on life satisfaction.
