    "abstract": "\n\nWe take up two questions that have not been explored in research on enterprise zones. First, does a considerably longer-run perspective on the effects of state enterprise zones lead to different answers? And second, are there heterogeneous effects of enterprise zones that depend on the set of incentives these programs offer, which can vary widely? Our results indicate that whether we look at state enterprise zone programs through a longer-term lens, or through the lens of program heterogeneity, we generally do not find any consistent indication of beneficial effects of state enterprise zone programs, and if anything the longer-run effects are negative. The lack of positive effects is consistent with most of the prior evidence that focuses on effects that are short-term and homogeneous.\n\n",
