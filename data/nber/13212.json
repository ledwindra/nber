    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the membership dynamics of union local organizations.  The analysis links across time the reports labor organizations file as part of the Labor Organization Reporting System (LORS).  Analogous to findings in the labor dynamics literature, we find substantial reallocation of membership across locals.  While overall there is net decline, there is significant positive gross membership creation for some local organizations.\n\n",
