Introduction

This paper examines the role of lumpy consumer durables and market power
in generating endogenous cycles. The idea we model is simple. When goods
are durable, past consumption choices determine the current market size
which consists of consumers who have not purchased the good previously.
Larger past sales, ceteris paribus, thus naturally result in a smaller current
market size. In this manner, the seeds of a downturn are sown in an upturn.
The properties of the cycles predicted by our model are consistent with
a number of empirical regularities. Among the stylized facts on business
cycles are pro-cyclical real wages, counter-cyclical prices, and durable good
consumption being more volatile than output.1 A more detailed discussion
of the empirical implications can be found in Section 3.1.
Expenditure on consumer durables is often seen as a leading indicator for
business cycles and there is considerable evidence that consumer durables
play an important role in the business cycle. For example, Olney (1999)
argues that the debt incurred for consumer durables, like cars, helped create
the Great Depression. As consumers burdened with high debt cut spending,
output fell as did factor demand, reducing proÞts and wages which in turn
further reduced demand and this spiralled into the Great Depression. Gordon

Stock and Watson (1999), Cooley and Prescott (1995), and King and Rebelo (1999)
report that prices are counter-cyclical, and durable good consumption is pro-cyclical and
volatile. Barsky, Parker and Solon (1994) and Bils (1987) argue that when measured
correctly real wages are pro-cyclical.

(1980) argues that the 1955 surge in the automobile market led a general
boom in the economy.
Our work relates to three strands of literature: indivisibilities, endogenous
business cycles, and durable good monopoly. The literature on indivisibilities has dealt with the non convex production sets created by indivisibilities,2 with indivisibilities in investment or R&D leading to spurts of activity,3
and with indivisibilities in labor supply raising the intertemporal elasticity
of labor supply.4 However, there has been little work on indivisibilities in
consumption.
We model a a zero-one kind of indivisibility in consumption: individuals buy one unit or none and cannot resell the good which lasts for only
two periods. This zero-one form is meant to reßect the idea that the good
must be of a minimum size.5 In practice, there are ways to make such goods
non-durable and divisible such as renting or sharing their services. However,
to the extent that it is more costly to rent than buy and because of problems sharing durables, these are not perfect substitutes.6 For simplicity, we
abstract from such alternatives.

It is not possible to downsize endlessly as a way of reducing the extent of lumpiness:
after all, a refrigerator has to be of a minimum size to be able to hold the needed perishables
and a car can only be so small.
6
At low income levels, even clothing is seen as indivisible good. One of the most
successful projects undertaken by the World Bank involved subsidizing purchases of wood
stoves. The initial cost of such stoves, around 10 to 25 dollars, prohibited their widespread
usage although they are more eﬃcient than native stoves made of mud.

The business cycle literature provides several models in which cycles may
arise endogenously. One route is via dynamic models where, for some parameter values, the economy does not converge to a steady state, but to a
limit cycle, see for example, Diamond and Fudenberg (1989). Cycles may
also emerge through expectational eﬀects which could be related to exogenous variables like “animal spirits” as in Howitt and McAfee (1992), or to
endogenous variables like prices and interest rates as in Grandmont (1985).
In these models, both cyclical as well as non-cyclical behavior is possible. A
third route for cycles to arise is via persistent exogenous shocks which get
propagated through the system as in the real business cycles literature. See
King and Rebelo (1999) for a survey of this literature.7 In contrast to the
above literature, endogenous cycles arise generically in our model. Past pricing decisions leads to current demand conditions, and this results in endogenous business cycles in the absence of any exogenous shocks or expectational
eﬀects.
The literature on durable goods has focused on the price path chosen
by a durable good monopolist in a partial equilibrium setting.8 By assuming that consumers are inÞnitely lived and continually replenished, Conlisk,
Gerstner and Sobel (1984) argue that pricing behavior of a durable good mo7

There has been much criticism of standard RBC models in terms of their ability to
generate cycles which match the data. Large shocks are needed to generate the needed
supply response given the fairly low intertemporal supply elasticities usually estimated,
and persistent shocks are needed to generate cycles.

See, for example, Stokey (1979) and Bulow (1982).

nopolist could exhibit cycles in a stationary environment due to endogenous
ßuctuations in market size.
We focus on the general rather than partial equilibrium implications. We
also move away from the standard focus on inter temporal price discrimination by ensuring that consumers always prefer buying now to later.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we develop the goods
and factor market equilibria. Section 3 looks at why endogenous cycles arise
under the assumption that Þrms are identical. Section 4 generalizes our
results to the case where Þrms are allowed to diﬀer in the demand conditions
they face. We also look at the role of income distribution and argue that
a more equal distribution of income could make cycles deeper. Section 5
shows that allowing forward looking behavior on the producers’ side or credit
markets does not alter our basic results. Section 6 concludes.9

The Model

This paper builds on the model developed in Krishna and Yavas (2000).
The model is constructed to allow an elementary presentation. While its
components are standard, the model itself is new.

An Appendix, available on request, includes calculations for a special case which we
use as an illustration.

2.1

Assumptions

There are two types of goods in the economy: One divisible non durable,
and for now, non storable, good produced under perfect competition, and a
continuum of durable goods, indexed by θ ∈ [0, 1], each produced by a proÞt
maximizing monopolist.10 In each period, a new set of individuals arrives in
the economy. Each individual lives for two periods. In each period of his
life he derives utility from the consumption of the non durable good and of
a speciÞc type of durable good. We assume that used durables cannot be
resold.11 Thus, consumers who buy the durable good in the second period of
their lives get only one period of use.
Individuals are heterogenous in two dimensions. Individual (θ, γ) has a
potential demand for one unit of the durable good θ ∈ [0, 1] and his productivity is γ ∈ [0, 1]. We assume that each consumer derives utility V each
period from his durable good, and that V is large. Thus, he would purchase
the durable good as soon as he could even if prices are expected to fall in
the following period. This, of course, makes indirect utility discontinuous:
consumers who are just able to buy the good are signiÞcantly better oﬀ than
those with a slightly smaller income.12
10

It should be possible to generalize this to oligopoly at the cost of some complexity.
This could occur beacuse of transactions costs or the lemons’ problem associated with
resale.
12
Although we assume below that V is very high, that agents live for only two periods, and that the non durable good has constant marginal utility, these assumptions are
made for simplicity. Diminishing marginal utility and a low V results in some of the non
durable good being purchased before the durable one making the indirect utility function
continuous, though non convex. See Ng (1965). This would aﬀect the exact form of the
11

5

At each point of time, new consumers have an equal probability of having
a potential demand for any θ so that there is a uniform distribution over
θ. We assume throughout that γ and θ are independently distributed, and
these distributions are time invariant. This ensures that all monopolists face
the same problem if they inherit the same set of old consumers. The set
of consumers who have a demand for the durable good θ are of measure
zero relative to the set of all consumers. Thus, the pricing behavior of a
monopolist does not have any general equilibrium eﬀects.13 Durable good
Þrms are monopolists, and therefore they set prices to maximize their proÞts.
Thus, there tends to be too little of the durable good made.
We will use Assumption 1 below whenever concreteness is called for, and
will draw the diagrams given this assumption. However, we present the result
in a manner that shows they are more generally valid.
Assumption 1 New individuals are distributed uniformly over the unit
square in each period with unit density.

2.2

Factor Market

Labor is the only factor of production in the economy. We normalize the size
of each generation at unity. As there are two cohorts, the size of the labor
demand curve facing producers but not its nature. Similarly, allowing many generations
of agents would just increase the complexity of the model and not aﬀect the basic results.
13
The assumption that there are a continuum of Þrms and agents removes the familiar
“Numeraire Problem” in the literature. It makes the choice of a numeraire irrelevant as
no individual incorporates the general equilibrium eﬀect of his actions into his decision
making.

6

force at any given period is 2. Workers with productivity γ make γ units
of the non durable good and they produce αγ units of output in durables.
Workers in the durable good sector are compensated according to a piece
rate wage, w. We take the non durable good to be the numeraire. A worker
with productivity γ will have an earning of γ in the non durable good sector.
The same worker will produce αγ units of output in the durable good sector,
and earn αγw. For both goods to be produced in equilibrium the wage has to
be equal to α1 . If the piece-rate wage in durables, w, is greater than α1 , then
all workers prefer to work making durables. Marginal cost of production in
the durable good sector is constant at the piece rate wage, so c = α1 . Note
that the allocation of labor between the two sectors will be determined by
the demand for labor in the durable good sector.
Assumption 2 α > 1.
As explained later, this assumption ensures that the durable good sector
is viable.

2.3

Goods Market

To begin with we focus on the symmetric case, and assume that consumers
cannot save or borrow so that consumers spend their entire income in each
period.14 An individual’s income consists of two components. The Þrst component is labor earnings. As discussed in the previous section, this depends
14

As shown in Section 5.2, this assumption is not central.

7

on the productivity of the individual, with higher productivity individuals
earning more. The second component of the income is the proÞt share. For
concreteness we focus on two extreme cases. These are described as Assumption 3(a) and 3(b) below.
Assumption 3(a) ProÞts accrue only to consumers with very high values
of γ.
In this case Þrms choose not to sell only to the very rich as they can
at most charge them V and they are small in number, but to the broader
market.
Assumption 3(b) ProÞts are equally distributed across all individuals in
the economy.
In this case each individual is entitled to 12 Π as his proÞt share as the
total population (labor force and hence consumers) in the economy is 2.
Let P be the price of a durable good. Let Π(γ) denote the proÞt share
for an individual with productivity γ. Thus, an individual with productivity
γ has income of Π(γ) + γ so that he will purchase his durable good if
P ≤ Π(γ) + γ
assuming that he does not already have it. The balance of his income is
spent on the non durable good.

8

The demand function facing a typical durable good Þrm given the proportion of young consumers served in the previous period, λt−1 , and expected
aggregate proÞts of Πt is denoted by D(P, Πt , λt−1 ). Figures 1(a) and (b) depict demand under our standing assumptions and Assumption 3(a) and (b)
respectively.
First consider what happens if there are no old consumers, i.e., λt−1 = 1,
and aggregate proÞts are zero, i.e., demand is D(P, 0, 1). This is depicted
in Figure 1 by the line Dd which gives the proportion of young individuals
with a productivity higher than the price, P . If proÞts exist and go only
to the most productive, who are a small part of the population, then only
their demand could be aﬀected by changes in Π. Willingness to pay equals
the lower of total earnings and V. If earnings exceed V for all these agents,
demand is unaﬀected as depicted in Figure 1(a) by V JT D.
If proÞts are equally distributed, changes in Π move the demand curve
vertically as

Π

is added to each individual’s income and his willingness to pay

for the durable good. At a price of
good, and as price falls below

Π
2

Π
2

all individuals can aﬀord the durable

there are no further increases in demand.

Hence we obtain a demand curve with a vertical segment as depicted in
Figure 1(b) as EeD.
The existence of some old individuals who have not previously purchased
the durable good causes a kink in the demand curve. The kink occurs at
the point on D(P, Π, 1) vertically above λt−1 , that is, at F in Figure 1. The

demand curve intersects the horizontal axis at (2 − λt−1 ). At prices below
the kink, a unit reduction in the price level will result in twice the increase
in the demand relative to that above the kink. The resulting demand curve,
D(.), is given by V JT F H in Figure 1(a) and EF HK in Figure 1(b) and is
the maximum of the two curves, V JT D and IH in Figure 1(a) and EeD
and IHK in Figure 1(b). We denote the steeper curve where only the young
are served, by D∗ (.), and the ßatter one by D̂(.).

Symmetric Equilibrium

The endogenous variables in the system at time t consist of the proÞts earned
by each Þrm, denoted by π t , the proportion of young individuals served,
denoted by λt , and the price charged by Þrms making the durable good, Pt .
In this section we assume that the proportion of young consumers served in
period t − 1, λt−1 , is the same for all Þrms. This assumption is relaxed in
Section 4.
It is easy to derive the proÞt maximizing choice of the Þrm for given levels
of aggregate proÞts, Πt , and λt−1 . Since there is a unit mass of identical Þrms
in this model, the proÞts of each Þrm equal aggregate proÞts in the symmetric
equilibrium. Setting these equal gives the proÞts in symmetric equilibrium
at time t. Knowing the equilibrium level of proÞts then enables one to Þnd
the remaining endogenous variables including the state variable in the next
period, λt .

11

Consider the output choice of an individual Þrm at a given level of λt−1
and Π. There are three candidates for the proÞt maximizing output choice of
each monopolist. Firms never choose to serve the whole market as it is not
proÞtable as argued later. Thus, his optimal choice must lie either along the
ßatter part of the demand curve, or the steeper part of the demand curve.
Let π(Π, λt−1 ) be the proÞts along D(.), while π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) denote the proÞts along D∗ (.) and D̂(.) respectively.15 Demand is given by D∗ (.)
for high prices and by D̂(.) for lower ones. An increase in λt−1 increases the
region over which D∗ (.) is relevant as it shifts D̂(.) down vertically, but does
not aﬀect the level of D∗ (.). Note that demand becomes more elastic, and
π P jumps up at the kink. Since π P along both D∗ (.) and D̂(.) is downward
sloping due to concavity of π ∗ and π̂, the Þrst order condition, π P = 0, can
never be satisÞed at the kink. In other words, proÞts are maximized either
along D∗ (.), above the kink, or along D̂(.), below the kink, but never at the
kink.
Figure 2(a) and (b) depict π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) under Assumption 3(a)
and (b) respectively.
Lemma 1 Under Assumption 3(a), both π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) are independent of Π and hence weakly convex in Π. Under Assumption 3(b) both π ∗ (Π)
as well as π̂(Π, λt−1 ) are increasing functions of aggregate proÞts with slopes
15

We will use the following convention from here on to simplify the notation. The
absence of P as a variable indicates that the function is a value function as P has been
maximized out.

Assumption 2, both have positive intercepts.
Proof: Let P ∗ (Q, Π), P̂ (Q, Π, λt−1 ) and P (Q, Π, λt−1 ) denote the inverse demand curves corresponding to D∗ (.), D̂(.) and D(.), respectively. An
increase in Π has no eﬀect on demand under Assumption 3(a). Hence
in Figure 2(a), π ∗ (Π) = π ∗ and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) = π̂(λt−1 ) are horizontal.
For high (low) λt−1 , π ∗ exceeds (falls short of) π̂(λt−1 ). As λt−1 rises,
π̂(λt−1 ) falls. At λt−1 = λ̃ the two lines coincide.
Under Assumption 3(b) an increase in proÞts shifts demand upward by

If there were no sales in the previous period, then sales would be at
most equal to 2. If sales were at this maximum possible level, proÞts
would rise one for one with aggregate proÞts. However, sales are less
than this maximum so that both π ∗ (Π) and π̂(Π, λt−1 ) are ßatter than
the 450 line as depicted in Figure 2(b).16
16

Note that if a Þrm sells to the entire market when aggregate proÞts are zero, then
individual proÞts must be negative since price is zero and cost is positive. This results in
a negative intercept for the individual proÞt curve and no intersection with the 450 line
in Figure 2.

14

The proÞt maxima along D̂ and D∗ lie along rays emanating from c as
drawn in Figure 1.17 Suppose that for a given level of aggregate proÞts,
the proÞts along D̂ and D∗ are equal, so that the same iso-proÞt contour
is tangent to both,18 that is in Figure 2, π ∗ (.) and π̂(.) curves intersect
at this proÞt level. Then output along D̂ exceeds that along D∗ so
that the slope of π̂(.) exceeds that of π ∗ (.) at this point. From this
it also follows that there can be at most one intersection between the
two as depicted in Figure 2 since multiple intersections would violate
this slope relation. Therefore, proÞts are given by π̂(Π, λt−1 ) above the
intersection point, and by π ∗ (Π) below the intersection point and π(.)
is the maximum of π∗ (.) and π̂(.). Both π∗ (.) and π̂(.) are convex in
Π since output rises with Π under assumption 3(b) and is unchanged
under assumption 3(a). Since the maximum of convex functions remains
convex, π(.), is convex as well.
The vertical intercept of the demand function is unity if there are no
aggregate proÞts. If α ≤ 1, then costs exceed this intercept so that the
optimal production level is zero and proÞts along both demand curves
are negative at zero aggregate proÞts. In conjunction with proÞts being
17

In the absence of the linearity ensured by Assumption 1, these rays are replaced by the
proÞt expansion paths which would trace out the proÞt maximizing points along D∗ (.) and
D̂(.) as aggregate proÞts rise. Individual proÞts are convex in aggregate proÞts because
when proÞt expansion paths are upward sloping output rises with increases in aggregate
proÞts.

ßatter than the 450 line, this means that there is no positive aggregate
proÞt level at which the two intersect so that the durable good sector is
not viable. If α > 1, as assumed, then these intercepts are positive so
that an intersection in the positive quadrant is ensured and the durable
good sector is viable.
Proposition 1 There is a unique equilibrium proÞt level.
Proof: Positive intercepts, together with π∗Π (Π) ≤ π̂ Π (Π, λt−1 ) < 1 under both
Assumption 3(a) and (b) ensures a unique intersection of π(Π, λt−1 )
and the 450 line and hence a unique consistent level of proÞts denoted
by Π(λt−1 ). Under Assumption 3(a), proÞts of a single Þrm are independent of aggregate proÞt levels while under Assumption 3(b), they
depend on aggregate proÞt levels.
Now we show that the equilibrium must involve cycles. As the proportion
of old consumers rises so does the proÞt from serving them, i.e., as λt−1 falls
π̂(Π, λt−1 ) shifts upward. As a result, in equilibrium, proÞts are maximized
along π̂(Π, λt−1 ) for λt−1 < λ̃ and along π ∗ (Π) for λt−1 > λ̃. Thus, in Figure
2, equilibrium proÞts fall as λt−1 rises for λt−1 ≤ λ̃, and they are constant
at Π∗ for λt−1 > λ̃. At λt−1 = λ̃, π̂(Π, λt−1 ) and π ∗ (Π) intersect along the
450 line. Similarly, output falls with increases in λt−1 for λt−1 ≤ λ̃ and is
unaﬀected by λt−1 for λt−1 > λ̃.
In Figure 1 this corresponds to output and proÞts in equilibrium being
obtained from the intersection of D∗ (.) and the ray through c associated with
16

D∗ (.) for high values of λt−1 and from the intersection of D̂(.) and the ray
through c associated with D̂(.) for low enough λt−1 . The switchover occurs
at λt−1 = λ̃. When λt−1 = λ̃, maximizing proÞts along D̂(.) and D∗ (.) yields
the same level of proÞts. Hence the iso-proÞt contour is tangent to both D̂(.)
and D∗ (.).
A monopolist’s problem can also be thought of as choosing the proportion
of the young served in the current period, λt , as a function of the young
served in the previous period, λt−1 . This gives us a relation between λt and
λt−1 which we denote by λt (λt−1 ). As usual, the proportion of young served
depends on whether the price chosen is along D∗ (.) or D̂(.), and λ∗t or λ̂t
correspond to the value of λt (λt−1 ), respectively. Next we proceed to the
properties of this relationship.
Lemma 2
λt (λt−1 ) = λ∗ < λt−1 f or λt−1 ≥ λ̃
λt (λt−1 ) = λ̂(λt−1 ) > λt−1 f or λt−1 ≤ λ̃
and
dλ̂(λt−1 )
> 0.
dλt−1
Proof: If λt−1 < λ̃, equilibrium proÞts are given by the intersection of π̂(λt−1 , Π)
and the 450 line. Firms choose to price below the kink in Figure 1 and
to serve both the young and the old. Output is given by the intersection of the ßatter ray through c and D̂(.). The fraction of young
17

served at this price is derived by going back to D∗ (.) and is denoted by
λ̂(λt−1 ). Output exceeds the share of young consumers served as both
the young and old are served. Note that λ̂(λt−1 ) > λt−1 as the Þrm will
never price near the kink. As λt−1 falls, output rises but λ̂ falls!
When λt−1 > λ̃, equilibrium proÞts are given by the intersection of
π ∗ (λt−1 , Π) and the 450 line so that proÞts, output and λt are unaﬀected
by λt−1 . As Þrms choose to price above the kink in Figure 1, λ∗ < λt−1 .
Moreover, as only the young are served, output equals λt = λ∗ .
Lemma 3 λ̂(λ̃) > λ̃ > λ∗ .
Proof: This can be seen by setting λt−1 in Figure 1 at λ̃ so that λ̂ corresponds
to λ̂(λ̃). Now note that λ̂(λ̃) > λ̃ > λ∗ .
We can now depict the relationship between λt−1 and λt as in Figure 3.
When λt−1 is zero, the market size is merely doubled so that pricing is the
same as when λt−1 is unity, although output is doubled. Under Assumption
3(a) this makes λt (0) = λt (1) as drawn in Figure 3. Under Assumption 3(b),
λt (0) > λt (1) since the higher aggregate proÞts at λt−1 = 0 shift demand
up compared to when λt−1 = 1. This is the only diﬀerence between the two
cases.
Proposition 2 The economy must have Þnite period cycles. If G(.) is uniform, only two period cycles are possible.

3.1

Some Empirical Implications

Among the stylized facts on business cycles are pro-cyclical real wages, countercyclical prices and durable good consumption more volatile than output.
There is much evidence in the empirical literature suggesting that wages rise
with output, that is they are procyclical. Real wages, when measured appro19

priately, tend to be pro-cyclical although some studies Þnd that they are not
tightly tied to the business cycle. Using longitudinal data, Barsky, Parker
and Solon (1994) show that individual real wages are more pro-cyclical than
average wages which are at best marginally procyclical. This is a consequence
of marginal workers with below average wages entering the labor market in
good times which drags average wages down. Using cross sectional data they
also show that durable goods prices, as well as the prices of non durables in
concentrated industries, are signiÞcantly counter-cyclical.
Nominal wages in our model are Þxed in terms of the numeraire good.
However, real incomes are not and the real incomes of diﬀerent groups may
move diﬀerently. We deÞne real incomes as the income left over for the
consumption the non durable good. Thus, individuals who purchase the
good are better oﬀ as

Πt
2

− Pt rises. Those who do not buy the good gain

if Πt rises. In the Þrst period of the boom Πt − Pt rises as this is necessary
for more of the young to be served. ProÞts also rise as Þrms prefer λ̂(λ∗ )
to λ∗ although the latter is still available to them. Later in the upturn, λ
rises and equilibrium proÞts fall (as the curve π̂ shifts down) though Πt − Pt
necessarily rises with λ. When the downturn comes, λ falls, taking Πt − Pt
with it. In addition proÞts fall to their minimum of Π∗ . Figure 4 depicts the
path of λt , Qt , Πt , and

Πt
2

− Pt . Thus, correlation between

Πt
2

− Pt , the real

income of the rich, and proÞts need not be positive or negative, and our work
supports the idea that disaggregated data, both across groups of individuals

as well as over periods in the cycle need to be examined.
Stock and Watson (1999) report that the cyclical component of prices is
counter-cyclical, and that this negative correlation is stable since the early
50s. There have been many explanations in the literature for the observed
counter-cyclical prices and markups, especially in durable goods and with imperfectly competitive markets. Stiglitz (1984) argues that this occurs because
marginal buyers have more elastic demand. Similarly, Bils (1989) argues that
in booms, consumers with low willingness to pay enter the market and this
raises demand elasticity, which causes price decreases in booms. Rotemberg
and Saloner (1986) argue that counter cyclical pricing comes from enforcing
collusion. The gains from price cutting are higher in good times so that only
lower prices can be supported in a repeated game.
In our model there are two factors that determine income, and hence
21

willingness to pay: proÞt earnings and wage income. Wage income is acyclical
while proÞt earnings tend to rise with output. For output to rise a higher
proportion of consumers need to be able to buy the durable good. Thus,
the behavior of prices in our model depends on the distribution of proÞts. If
proÞts are distributed evenly to all consumers, then income level in a boom
will rise, and both prices and output could rise. If proÞts are captured by
only a small group, then prices must fall for output to rise. Thus, unless
asset ownership is widespread, the model’s predictions accord with the facts.
Durable goods sales are widely understood to be pro-cyclical and more
volatile than output.19 Durable good consumption rises in our model during
good times and as total labor supply is Þxed, consumption of non durables
actually shrinks in a boom. This makes sales of durables more volatile than
total output. Adding an elastic labor supply would allow non durables production to be procyclical as well.

Asymmetric Equilibrium

In the previous section we assumed all Þrms were symmetric. In this section
we allow Þrms to inherit diﬀerent market sizes and show that it does not
aﬀect our results.
Proposition 3 Even if Þrms diﬀer in terms of their inherited market size,
each Þrm has a Þnite period cycle and there are a Þnite number of Þrm types
19

See, for example, Stock and Watson (1999), King and Rebelo (1999), and Cooley and
Prescott (1995).

22

in steady state. Hence, aggregate cycles are of Þnite length.
Proof: Firms, with diﬀerent market sizes will have diﬀerent π(Π, λt−1 ) curves
as a function of Π alone. However, for the same reasons as earlier,
these curves are increasing but ßatter than the 450 line, have positive
intercepts and are convex. Under Assumption 3(b), each type will have
diﬀerent aggregate proÞt levels (Π̃(λt−1 )) at which their proÞt functions
switch from being π ∗ (Π) to π̂(Π, λt−1 ). To derive equilibrium proÞts,
we need to construct the appropriate (according to the distribution of
Þrm types) convex combination of these proÞt functions. However, this
aggregate function will have the same properties, namely, it will be increasing but ßatter than the 450 line, have a positive Y intercept and
be convex in aggregate proÞts. The intersection of this aggregate proÞt
function with the 450 line gives unique aggregate proÞts in equilibrium.
Under Assumption 3(a), proÞts do not aﬀect demand so that the behavior of Þrms is independent of aggregate proÞt levels and hence of
the distribution of Þrms. The analysis of the previous section carries
over and asymmetries of this form do not aﬀect the analysis. Firms
who served λt−1 of the young in the previous period choose to serve
λ̂(λt−1 ) of the young today if λt−1 < λ̃, while if λt−1 > λ̃, they serve λ∗
of the young. Since cycles for each Þrm are of Þnite length, so are the
number of diﬀerent types of Þrms in steady state.
Under Assumption 3(b), things are more complicated. As the distri23

bution of Þrms changes, so does the level of equilibrium proÞts. For
a given distribution of Þrms, and aggregate proÞts, some Þrms will
choose to price at λ∗ (Π). Others will choose to price at diﬀerent levels
along λ̂(Π, λt−1 ). It can be veriÞed by using Figure 1(b) that the λ̂(.)
and λ∗ (.) curves shift upwards with an increase in aggregate proÞts.
This follows from the fact that output and hence the proportion of
young served rising with aggregate proÞts. λ̃(Π) also rises with aggregate proÞts. Recall that the slope of individual proÞts in Figure 2 is
related to the output chosen. Hence π̂ Π (Π, λ̃) > π ∗Π (Π). Thus to keep
π̂(Π, λ̃) = π ∗ (Π), λ needs to rise with an increase in aggregate proÞts.
We know that in equilibrium, proÞts cannot be lower than those that
obtained when all Þrms sell only to the young or higher than those
when all Þrms served no consumer in the previous period, λt−1 = 0,
that is they must lie between Π∗ and Π̂(0) derived in the symmetric
h
i
case. For each proÞt level in the interval Π∗ , Π̂(0) there is a λ̂(Π, λt−1 )

and a λ̃(Π). Let m0 (Π) > 0 be the smallest horizontal distance between

λ̂(Π, λt−1 ) and the 450 line, and let m0 > 0 denote the smallest value of
h
i
0
∗
m (Π) for all Π in the interval Π , Π̂(0) . Thus, a Þrm which inherits
a λt−1 below λ̃(.) must increase its λ by at least m0 . λ̃(Π̂(0)) is the
highest value of λ̃(.) that is possible and λ∗ (Π∗ ) is the lowest value
that λ can take. Hence a Þrm can take at most

λ̃(Π̂(0))−λ∗ (Π∗ )
m0

periods

to cross the switchover point. Hence, each Þrm can have at most a

24

cycle of length
λ̃(Π̂(0))−λ∗ (Π∗ )
m0

λ̃(Π̂(0))−λ∗ (Π∗ )
.
m0

As a consequence, there can be at most

diﬀerent kinds of Þrms since when a Þrm switches over, it

joins all other Þrms which have switched with it.

4.1

No Aggregate Cycles

Although we have shown that individual Þrms must have cycles, there need
not be aggregate cycles, although this is a non-generic case. Suppose that
half the Þrms inherit λ∗ (Π0 ) while the other half inherit λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) and aggregate proÞts, Π0 , are such that the proÞt function derived by giving equal
weight to these two types of Þrms intersects the 450 line at Π0 so that this
is an equilibrium. Let λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) > λ̃(Π0 ) as is the case with the uniform
distribution. Given this level of proÞts, Þrms which inherit λ∗ (Π0 ) choose to
serve both the young and old and serve λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) of their young, while Þrms
which inherit λ̂(λ∗ , Π0 ) choose to serve only their young, and λ∗ (Π0 ) of them.
In each period, Þrms switch types so that there are no aggregate cycles.20
Similarly, there are no aggregate cycles if there are T types of Þrms, each
with a proportion 1/T, and with T period cycles. In this case, Þrms switch
types but the distribution of types is unchanged over time.

4.2

Aggregate Cycles

When aggregate market size varies over time, the economy has aggregate
cycles. The depth of the cycle depends on the asymmetry between Þrms.
20

This argument is valid under both Assumption 3(a) and 3(b).

Figure 5 depicts a two period aggregate cycle under Assumption 3(b).

In

this case there are at most two types of Þrms. Those types which have a large
market in the current period and those who have a smaller market. If there
are a greater proportion of the Þrst type, aggregate proÞts are higher than
when the reverse is true. Call the equilibrium proÞts in the Þrst instance ΠH
and in the second ΠL . Firms of the Þrst type whose good periods are synchronized with that of the market, cycle between λ̂(λ∗ (ΠL ), ΠH ) and λ∗ (ΠL )
(denoted by λ∗L ) while Þrms of the second type whose good periods, are
asynchronized with the market, cycle between λ̂(λ∗ (ΠH ), ΠL ) and λ∗ (ΠH )
(denoted by λ∗H ). Note that an increase in aggregate proÞts shifts λ̂(., Π),

26

λ∗ (Π) and λ̃(Π) upwards. This two period cycle will be the case if
λ̂(λ∗ (ΠL ), ΠH ) > λ̂(λ∗ (ΠH ), ΠL ) > λ̃(ΠH ) > λ̃(ΠL ) > λ∗ (ΠH ) > λ∗ (ΠL ).
In this event, the cycle of type 1 Þrms encloses the cycle of type 2 Þrms.
Thus, their cycle is deeper than that of type 2 Þrms as depicted.
Under Assumption 3(a), there are no aggregate proÞt eﬀects so that the
λ̂(λ) and λ∗ curves are independent of the aggregate proÞt level in equilibrium. In this case, all Þrms follow the same path. Yet, there is an aggregate
cycle if the proportion of Þrms are not equal. There can be aggregate cycles
of more than two period length in steady state if λ̂(λ∗ ) < λ̃. However, cycles
remain of Þnite length since there are a Þnite number of type of Þrms, each
with a cycle of Þnite length.

4.3

Income Distribution and the Cycle Depth

Under Assumption 3(a), distribution of ownership shares and hence proÞts
is very unequal while it is equal under Assumption 3(b). A comparison of
the outcomes under these two assumptions gives some insight into how the
distribution of assets might aﬀect the depth of cycles. Consider a two period
aggregate cycle case. Let σ ≥ 1/2 denote the proportion of Þrms that are
in the majority. As this majority rises, proÞts in the good state (H) and
bad state (L) diverge, i.e., cycles deepen. When σ equals unity, all Þrms
are alike so that aggregate proÞts in the good state are as high as they will

get and in the bad state are as low as they will get.21 When σ equals one
half, then there are no aggregate cycles. Figure 6 depicts this relationship
under assumptions 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. When proÞts are distributed
evenly, the level of proÞts in both states is higher than when proÞts accrue
only to the most productive (Assumption 3(b) versus 3(a)).The diﬀerence
in the good and bad states is also greater so that the two curves are more
spread out as drawn. This suggests that an economy with a more widespread
ownership of productive assets would also be faced with deeper cycles!22
In the bad period ΠL (1) = Π∗ , and in the good period ΠH (1) = Π̂(λ∗ ).
More generally, when more assets are held by the more productive, a boom will raise
proÞts and make the demand curve more inelastic as well as shifting it upwards. By
assuming an equal distribution of assets, we have eliminated the Þrst eﬀect which would
tend to reduce output and raise price in a boom.

Robustness

In this section we show that relaxing a number of assumptions made so far,
including that of myopic behavior on the part of Þrms, and no credit markets
will not change our main results.

5.1

Forward Looking Behavior

We have assumed so far that Þrms maximize their current period proÞts.
They do not take the eﬀects of their current choice on future proÞts into
account. Here we look at the eﬀect of such forward looking behavior on the
part of Þrms and argue that such behavior tends to deepen the cycle, not
eliminate it.

23

Think of a Þrm as choosing not output or price, but equivalently the
proportion of young consumers it serves, λt . By reducing λt today, a Þrm
can increase its market size tomorrow. We need to add the value of future
which depends only on its choice of λt , denoted by Z(λt ), to the objective
function of a Þrm. Thus, a forward looking Þrm maximizes
π(λt , λt−1 , Πt ) + Z(λt )
and chooses λt so that
π λt (λt , λt−1 , Πt ) + Zλt (λt ) = 0.
23
Nor for that matter, would the possibility of carrying inventories aﬀect our results as
production costs are constant so that there is no gain from carrying inventories, and if
there are any costs of doing so, there will be no incentives to carry inventories.

29

On the other hand, a myopic Þrm maximizes π(λt , λt−1 , Πt ), and chooses λt
so that
π λt (λt , λt−1 , Πt ) = 0.
Since serving a greater proportion of the young today reduces the Þrm’s
demand and hence proÞts tomorrow, Zλt (λt ) ≤ 0. Hence, a forward looking
Þrm will, if anything, want to hoard customers.24
Consider the symmetric Þrm case with two period aggregate cycles. How
would a forward looking Þrm’s choices diﬀer from those of a myopic one? In
good times, when proÞts are high, a Þrm has no incentive to reduce λt since it
will not serve the customers it has hoarded in the next, low aggregate proÞt
period, anyway. In other words, in good times Zλt (λt ) = 0, and a forward
looking Þrm chooses the same level of output as a myopic Þrm. However, in
bad times, since it will serve its hoarded customers in the next period, i.e.,
since Zλt (λt ) < 0, a Þrm will have an incentive to reduce λt below that of a
myopic Þrm.25 But this will just deepen the cycle!26
24

Although proÞts are not single peaked there is an interior maximum so that the Þrst
order conditions hold.at every local maximum.
25
Note that proÞts fall as λt rises up till λ̃, and then are ßat. Due to this, proÞts are
weakly decreasing and convex in λt . As a result of this convexity in proÞts, a Þrm tends
to like variability in λt .
26
It is also worth pointing out that allowing for some competition between Þrms will
weaken the incentive to hoard customers as hoarded customers are like a public good,
available to all competitors of the Þrm as well as itself.

30

5.2

Credit Markets

So far we have assumed that there are no credit markets, or for that matter,
even savings possibilities, available to the consumer. We now argue that our
results are not dependent on this assumption. Credit markets reduce the
distortion caused by indivisibilities by increasing the set of consumers who
can aﬀord to buy the good. However, cycles remain.
We assume that credit markets are perfect and all those who can repay
their loans have access to credit. We show that while credit markets improve
welfare by expanding the range of consumers who can aﬀord the durable, they
do not eliminate cycles. For simplicity, we only use Assumption 3(a) in this
section. The results can be generalized at the cost of some complexity. We
will proceed as follows. First we will outline how the availability of credit
aﬀects eﬀective demand. From this we derive the demand and supply of
credit and show that when the rate of time preference, ρ, is zero, the analysis
looks no diﬀerent from that above.
The availability of credit changes the eﬀective demand faced by the monopolist. When the price is P0 , and only the young are served, individuals
with productivity exceeding P0 can buy the good even in the absence of credit
markets. However, credit allows more individuals to aﬀord the good, ceteris
paribus. Without credit markets, the demand by the young was given by the
line AB in Figure 7. With credit markets, an individual can aﬀord the good
if the price is less than the present discounted value of his income, P ≤

Thus, demand by the young consumers shifts up to AC where the point C
corresponds to the coordinates (0, 2+r
).
1+r
Credit markets also aﬀect demand by the old consumers. Individuals
who lent money when they were young have an income equal to (2 + r) times
their productivity in their second period. This relation is represented by the
line AD where D corresponds to the coordinates (0, 2 + r) in Figure 7. This
line lies above AC for r > 0. Suppose the price in the last period was P0 .
Individuals to the right of H were unable to buy the good in the last period
and their willingness to pay today lies along the line N A. Thus their demand
is given by N A, taking H as the origin. If price exceeds L, then none of
the old can aﬀord to buy the good. Only for prices below L can the old
participate. Thus, total demand from the young and the old in period 1 is
the horizontal sum of the demand of the young and old, and this results in
the kinked demand curve, CKP.
The equilibrium interest rate, r, is such that demand for credit is equal
to the supply of credit. What are the demand for and supply of credit at
given levels of prices? First note that only the young participate in the credit
market. The old earn revenue from repayments of past loans but neither lend
nor borrow. Now, suppose that only the young are served in period 0 while
both young and old are served in period 1. Let P0 be the price in period 0.
Then, individuals in M H demand credit as they can aﬀord the good on the
basis of their net worth but not based on their current income. Their demand

33

for credit is the diﬀerence between P0 and their current income. Hence credit
demand is given by the area EF G. As r rises AC becomes ßatter and at
given prices demand for credit falls. Hence we have the usual downward
sloping demand for credit.
The supply of credit comes from two sources. The Þrst source is individuals who cannot aﬀord the good today, even if they borrow, but who could
aﬀord it tomorrow if they save today and lend. If the price in period 1 is
given by P1 , this consists of the individuals in the region HI in Figure 7
whose supply of credit is the area HGJI. The second source is individuals
whose income exceeds the price of the durable, that is, those in region OM
who supply credit equal to the area P0 BE +

Π
2

(since proÞts are captured

by some of these agents), as well as individuals whose lifetime income (in
present value terms) is not high enough to aﬀord the durable good even if
they postpone consumption to the second period. This consists of individuals in the region IA who supply credit equal to area IJA. The Þrst source
is willing to lend (but only what is needed to buy the durable in the next
period) even if the interest rate, r, is less than the rate of time preference, ρ,
as lending today enables them to transfer part of their income to tomorrow
and thus aﬀord to buy the durable in their second period. On the other
hand, the second source is willing to lend only if r ≥ ρ because their motive
in lending is to consume more of the non durable good later on.
If r < ρ, the only source of credit is the Þrst one and as r rises AD

34

swings out and AC swings in moving I to the right and H to the left thereby
increasing credit supplied. If r > ρ, all agents to the right of H and left
of M supply credit. Since an increase in r moves H to the left and leaves
M unchanged, credit supplied rises as r rises. At r = ρ, there is a ßat
part for credit supply corresponding to individuals in OM and IA becoming
just willing to supply credit here. This ßat segment makes r = ρ a likely
candidate to be the equilibrium interest rate. Suppose ρ = 0. In this event,
it can be veriÞed that r = ρ = 0 is the unique equilibrium interest rate under
assumption 3(a) and a uniform distribution of γ.27
This case when r = ρ = 0 is illustrated in Figure 8. Note that here the
curves AC and AD are identical. If the monopolist serves only the young he
maximizes proÞts choosing E along AD. In the subsequent period, demand
is given by DEF as the kink occurs at E (the last period’s price) as in
the original model without credit. The monopolist chooses the point G to
maximize proÞts and prices at P1 < P0 . Of course, this results in a kink in the
subsequent period at H, so that demand is given by DHI. The monopolist
now Þnds it optimal to price at E and so the cycle develops. Note that
the only diﬀerence between this analysis and that without credit is that AD
plays the role of AB earlier. For the same reasons as before, we must have
cycles. For small perturbations in r and ρ, similar arguments work.
27

In the uniform distribution case it is easy to show that if ρ = 0, there are only two
period cycles and r = 0 is the only equilibrium in both periods of the cycle. The proof is
in the Appendix.

Concluding Remarks

Our work in this paper suggests an important role for income distribution,
and for the distribution of asset ownership on the characteristics of cycles
that economy will experience. It also provides a way of looking at the eﬀects
of inside as done above, and outside credit on the economy. In addition, the
simple general equilibrium structure developed provides a way to study a
number of issues in trade and development which are the subject of ongoing
research.

A.1

Calculations for the Uniform Distribution Case

In this Appendix we show that cycles are two period ones when the productivity parameter is distributed uniformly, γ ˜U[0, 1], even if Þrms are
not symmetric. Recall that when Þrms were symmetric, then two period
cycles were ensured if λ̂(λ∗ ) > λ̃ as shown in Section 3. When Þrms are
not symmetric, then the distribution of young served across Þrms aﬀects the
equilibrium level of proÞts as argued in Section 4. As a result, corresponding to any given distribution and hence aggregate proÞt level in equilibrium,
there correspond functions λ̂(λ∗ , Π), λ∗ (Π) and λ̃(Π) each of which has been
shown to be increasing in Π as depicted in Figure 5.
A suﬃcient condition for each Þrm to have only two period cycles is
thus that for each level of aggregate proÞts, and each viable value of λ∗ ,
λ̂(λ∗ , Π) > λ̃(Π). Recall that λ̂(λ, Π) increases as λ or Π rise and λ̃(Π) rises
with Π. Thus, if the above holds at the lowest feasible value of λ∗ and Π
on the left hand side and the highest possible value of Π on the right hand
side then it must hold throughout. The lowest feasible value of λ is the value
of λ∗ for the lowest feasible value of aggregate proÞts. The lowest level of
equilibrium proÞts occurs when none of the old are served by anyone. This
results in aggregate proÞts of Π∗ . When all Þrms inherit the largest feasible
market, i.e., the share of young served in the last period takes its lowest

41

value, the highest feasible value of Π = Π̂(λ∗ ) is realized. Thus,
λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π∗ ) > λ̃(Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))

(1)

is suﬃcent to ensure that there are only two period cycles, even with asymmetric Þrms.
We Þrst Þnd λ∗ and Π∗ . The proÞt level associated with the demand
curve D∗ , π ∗ (Π), is the value function for the problem:
M ax(1 +

Output is also equal to λ∗ (Π) as no old consumers are served. Individual

Of course, Π∗ , can be solved for by setting Þrm proÞts equal to aggregate

Now to Þnd Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )). When all Þrms inherit λ∗ (Π∗ ), demand will have
a kink at q = λ∗ (Π∗ ). The total number of potential consumers is 2 − λ∗ (Π∗ )
42

of which 1 − λ∗ (Π∗ ) are old consumers. Thus, the ßatter part of the demand
function can be expressed as
D̂ = 2 − λ∗ (Π∗ ) − 2(P −

Π
).
2

The proÞt level associated with the demand curve D̂, π̂(Π, λ∗ (Π∗ )), is the
value function for the problem:
Max(P − c)(2 − λ∗ (Π∗ ) − 2P + Π).

Demand by the young is represented by the steeper part of the demand
curve, D∗ (.). The proportion of the young served, λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )) can be found
by going back to D∗ (.) at P̂ (λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π). Thus, λ̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ), Π) is

We now have the left hand side of (1) and turn to the right hand side.
Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ )) denotes the equilibrium level of aggregate proÞts when all Þrms
inherit λ∗ (Π∗ ). Using (5) and setting individual proÞts to equal aggregate
ones gives Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ) to be

Now to Þnd λ̃(Π̂(λ∗ (Π∗ ))). If aggregate proÞts are Π, then λ̃(Π) can be found

π̂(Π, λ̃(Π)) = π ∗ (Π).

the proof.

A.2

Equilibrium When r = ρ = 0

We show that if ρ = 0, then r = 0 is the only equilibrium in both periods
of the cycle when the productivity parameter is uniformly distributed in the
unit interval.
28

While there are two roots to the equations we choose the negative root as the positive
ones results in infeasibly large output levels.

45

Following the notation in Section 5.2 we call the period where Þrms serve
only their young as period 0, and therefore P0 denotes the high price. Now,
we Þrst Þnd this price, P0 , and calculate the demand for credit and supply of
credit at P0 if r = ρ = 0. We Þnd that supply exceeds credit in such a case.
Even though potential supply exceeds demand at r = 0, the entire supply
comes from individuals who are indiﬀerent between supplying credit and not,
and supply of credit falls to zero at a negative interest rate. Therefore r = 0
is the equilibrium interest rate. Next we show that in the following period,
period 1, r = 0 remains the equilibrium interest rate.
A.2.1

Period 0 : High Price Period

The demand by the young at an interest rate of r = 0, DA in Figure 9, can
be expressed as
D∗ (r = 0) = 1 −

P0
.
2

If the Þrm serves only its young consumers then the optimal price is a solution
to the problem
Max(1 −

P0

which results in
c
P0 = 1 + , and
2
1 c

q0 =

Note that price exceeds 1 so that given Assumption 3(a) only the inÞnitesimally few who appropriate the proÞts can aﬀord the good on their

with a lifetime income in excess of the price, that is, individuals whose productivity and current income is greater than

P0
,
2

will get the credit equal to

the diﬀerence between their current income and the price. Thus, the demand
for credit is given by the area P0 EGB in Figure 9.
Supply of credit comes from two sources: half of the proÞts (share of
the young), and individuals whose current income is less than

P0
.
2

The proÞt

share of the young is 12 (P0 −c)q0 , while the supply of credit by poor individuals
is given by the area of the triangle Gλ0 A. Thus, total supply of credit will be
the area Gλ0 A + 12 (P0 − c)q0 . Note that along the line BA, P = 1 − q, and
along the line DA, P = 2 − 2q.
The demand for credit is

and the second term is strictly positive. Therefore, r = 0 is

the equilibrium interest rate in period 0.

A.2.2

Period 1 : Low Price Period

In the following period, the demand curve is given by DEF, and the monopolist chooses a lower price and serves a larger proportion of its young
consumers. The ßatter part of the demand curve can be expressed as
D̂ = 2 − λ0 − P =

3 c
+ −P

The optimal price, P1 , can be found by solving

Note that P1 exceeds 1 if c >

and it is less than 1 otherwise. Credit

demand comes from the young who cannot aﬀord the good based on their
current income.
Figure 9 (a) depicts the case for c < 2/5, i.e., P1 < 1. Then, individuals
in the interval Lλ1 demand credit equal to the area of the triangle IJK

What if c > 2/5? In this case, as in period 0, no individual can aﬀord the
good without borrowing. Figure 9 (b) depicts the case for c > 2/5. Demand
for credit is given by the area P1 JKB:

Cycles With Credit Markets
