    "abstract": "\n\nThis study exploits plausibly exogenous variation from the youngest sibling\u2019s school eligibility to estimate the effects of parental work on the weight outcomes of older children in the household. Data come from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth linked to the Child and Young Adult Supplement. We first show that mothers\u2019 work hours increase gradually as the age of the youngest child rises, whereas mothers\u2019 spouses\u2019 work hours exhibit a discontinuous jump at kindergarten eligibility. Leveraging these insights, we develop an instrumental variables model that shows that parents\u2019 work hours lead to larger increases in children\u2019s BMI z-scores and probabilities of being overweight and obese than those identified in previous studies. We find no evidence that the impacts of maternal and paternal work are different. Subsample analyses find that the effects are concentrated among advantaged households, as measured by an index involving education, race, and mother\u2019s marital status.\n\n",
