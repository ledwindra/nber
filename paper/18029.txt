ABSTRACT
A large economics literature seeks to understand the reasons why individuals make charitable contributions.
Fundamental features of most models of charitable giving are the inclusion of externalities induced
by other agents and the Lancasterian characteristics approach to specifying utility functions. This paper
develops a general, revealed-preference methodology for testing a variety of preference structures
that allow for both externalities and characteristics. The tests are simple linear programs that are transparent,
computationally efficient, and straightforward to implement. We show how the technique applies to
standard models of privately provided public goods and novel models that account for social comparisons
based on relative consumption and donations among individuals. We also conduct an original experiment
that enables nonparametric tests of many models on a single data set. The results provide the first revealed-preference
evidence on the importance of social comparisons when individuals make charitable contributions.
Models that include preferences for either relative consumption or donations yield greater explanatory
power than the standard model of impure altruism.

Introduction

There exists a large economics literature that seeks to understand why individuals make
charitable contributions. One explanation, based on the standard model of private provision
of a pure public good, assumes that individuals bene…t from the aggregate level of a public
good and may thus have an incentive to make voluntary contributions. The pure public good
model has well-known predictions about the crowding out of donations and pervasive freeriding.1 More recent research attempts to reconcile the standard model’s stark predictions
with the observation that people are typically more generous than the model predicts. Many
studies assume that individuals obtain a private bene…t from some aspect of their own giving,
and this encourages donations beyond that which would occur based on public bene…ts
alone. Di¤erent interpretations of the private bene…t range from a feeling of “warm-glow”
satisfaction, social approval, prestige and signalling about income.2
In this paper, we develop a revealed-preference methodology for testing general models
of charitable giving and provide experimental evidence on di¤erent motives driving actual
donations. Laboratory experiments are an increasingly common way to test for speci…c motives that underlie charitable behavior. Vesterlund (2006) describes how the control that
experimental methods a¤ord the researcher has broadened the scope of empirical analysis
beyond studies of crowding out to consider social norms, rules, and di¤erent ways of accounting for others’ behavior.3 Moreover, Vesterlund (2012) argues that “the objective is
no longer to determine whether individuals are sel…sh or cooperative, but instead whether
giving can be viewed as rational, and if so what set of preferences are consistent with the
observed pattern of giving”(p. 2).
One advantage of laboratory experiments in particular is the relative ease of employing
revealed-preference methods. Andreoni and Miller (2002) were the …rst to use revealed
preferences to test for a particular form of altruism. They consider individual preferences of
the form Ui (xi ; yi ), where xi and yi are payo¤s in a dictator game for oneself and another
anonymous subject. After asking subjects to make repeated choices with varying endowments
and relative prices, they …nd that the speci…ed utility function, which is considered altruistic
because it accounts for another’s payo¤, rationalizes the vast majority of subject behavior.

A useful general reference for the standard model is Bergstrom, Blume and Varian (1986), while other
papers provide more detailed studies of the model’s important properties with respect to crowding out (Warr
1982; Roberts 1984) and free-riding (Andreoni 1988).
2
Many of these models can be characterized broadly as re…nements or extensions on the impure public
good model (Cornes and Sandler 1984), which is based on joint production of private and public bene…ts.
References on the speci…c examples listed are Andreoni (1989, 1990), Hollander (1990), Harbaugh (1998),
and Glazer and Konrad (1986).
3
Experimental studies are not limited to the laboratory, however, and recent …eld experiments have
illuminated several important aspects of the market for charitable giving (see List 2011).

While revealed-preference methods have the distinct advantage of allowing nonparametric tests of di¤erent preference structures, researchers seeking to use them on a broader
set of motives for charitable behavior must confront an additional set of challenges. These
arise because classical revealed-preference techniques do not readily accommodate two features that are central to most theoretical models of charitable giving: externalities among
agents and Lancasterian (1971) characteristics within utility functions. Consider the model
of impure altruism (Andreoni 1989, 1990) with preferences Ui (xi ; yi + Y i ; yi ), where yi is
one’s charitable contribution and the additional term Y i is the sum of contributions by all
others. This is essentially a characteristics model because yi enters the utility function in two
places: the second argument as a contribution to the public good and the third argument
as the private, warm-glow bene…t. The existence of a public-good externality from giving,
through Y i , is also fundamental to the model and enters in only one of the characteristics.
To address these challenges, the …rst contribution of this paper is a general, revealedpreference methodology for testing a variety of preference structures that may underlie charitable giving. The approach builds on recent innovations in revealed-preference theory that
allow for the incorporation of externalities (Carvajal 2010; Deb 2009) and characteristics
(Blow, Browning, and Crawford 2008) into a standard model of consumption. Empirically,
the tests are simple linear programs that are transparent, computationally e¢ cient, and
straightforward to implement. While fully nonparametric and thus eliminating the need for
many ad-hoc assumptions about functional form, the approach allows for complete heterogeneity across agents because the analysis is conducted separately upon the repeated choices
of each individual.
The second contribution of the paper is consideration of several existing and novel
models of charitable giving within our revealed-preference framework. We show how the tests
apply to standard models of warm-glow giving, pure altruism, and impure altruism. Through
these cases, it is clear how the framework can readily accommodate models with externalities
and possibly joint production of private and public bene…ts from individual contributions.
A recent paper by Korenok, Millner and Rozzolini (2011) focuses on impure altruism and
employs a related approach based on the observation that arti…cially constructed prices
can be used to test the model. While their analysis has some features in common with
ours, as we will explain, the revealed-preference methodology developed here has meaningful
computational advantages and, more importantly, a level of generality that admits a range
of preferences beyond impure altruism. The methodology thus provides a tool that should
be useful for researchers employing revealed-preference analysis even beyond that considered
in the present paper.
The other preference structures that we do consider, however, account for social com2

parisons when individuals make decisions about charitable giving. In one case, we specify
a model in which individuals are motivated to donate because of concerns about how their
own donation compares to that of others. Shang and Croson (2006, 2009) report the results
of several …eld experiments that include social comparisons, and they …nd that donors to a
public radio station tend to adjust their contribution levels toward that of the social comparison. Our analysis is complementary in that we provide a close link to theory and show
how tests for the importance of social comparisons can exploit multiple choices of the same
individual rather than a cross section among individuals. We also consider an alternative
model in which the relevant social comparison for charitable giving is concern about relative
private consumption. The model of relative consumption is distinct in our case because it
implicitly takes account of relative wealth when individuals interpret comparative donation
levels. In e¤ect, this model speci…es preferences that depend on the “philanthropy”of others,
as opposed to solely the absolute amount donated. There is, of course, a large literature on
the importance of relative consumption for explaining consumer behavior, but we are not
aware of any other study that considers a model of relative consumption to explain charitable
giving.4
The third contribution of this paper is experimental results that demonstrate the applicability of our revealed-preference framework and highlight the importance of social comparisons for understanding charitable contributions. A distinct feature of our experimental
design is that several models are testable on a single data set. Subjects in a laboratory setting face allocation choices based on the division of tokens between themselves and a charity.
Through a series of choices for each subject, we vary the endowment of tokens and the value
per token for private consumption and charitable giving. The experimental design di¤ers
from that of Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Korenok et al. (2011) because a small, local,
non-pro…t organization receives the value of donated tokens, as opposed to another anonymous subject in the lab.5 More fundamental to our experimental design, however, is that
the subjects of primary interest were informed of the choices made by others in an earlier
round when faced with the same token endowment and relative prices. This simple design
allows both crowding out and social comparisons to a¤ect subject choices, thereby enabling
revealed-preference tests of the models described previously and combinations thereof.
The experimental results provide new evidence on the importance of social comparisons
4

References on the importance of relative consumption to consumer behavior include the classic work
of Veblen (1899), the more formal theory of Duesenberry (1949), and the popular writings of Frank (1985,
1999).
5
Another study based on revealed-preference analysis in a dictator game is Fisman, Kariv and Markovits
(2007). They use a graphical interface to replicate the results of Andreoni and Miller (2002) and conduct a
further experiment to distinguish preferences for giving from preferences that account for trade-o¤s between
the payo¤s of others.

to explain charitable giving. As a benchmark, and after making adjustments to control for
di¤erences in the power of revealed-preference tests, we …nd that the standard model of
impure altruism rationalizes the choices of 72 percent of our subjects. The model performs
substantially better than the special cases of warm-glow giving (50 percent) and altruism
consistent with provision of a pure public good (58 percent). But impure altruism performs
less well than models based on concerns about relative donations (80 percent) and relative
private consumption (81 percent). Empirically, these results, along with robustness checks
that we discuss, provide the …rst revealed-preference evidence on the importance of social
comparisons to the understanding of charitable giving.

Theoretical Framework

This section develops our theoretical framework in two steps. We begin with speci…cation of
a general utility function that nests di¤erent models for private provision of a public good,
including the standard models and novel ones that account for relative preferences. We then
illustrate how Lancasterian characteristics and externalities, both of which are fundamental
to the models we consider, complicate revealed-preference analysis. Finally, we establish a
theorem that enables revealed-preference tests of any model based on preferences that satisfy
properties of the general utility function.

2.1

The Utility Function

There are i = 1; :::; N agents in the economy. Each agent is endowed with wealth wi that
can be divided between consumption of a private good xi and donations to a public good yi .
Prices are denoted px and py . We de…ne the vectors x = (x1 ; : : : ; xN ) and y = (y1 ; : : : ; yN ),
along with x i and y i equal to the respective vector excluding the element for agent i.
P
P
Capital letters denote sums such that X =
i xi and X i =
j6=i xj , with Y and Y i
de…ned analogously.
We consider preferences of the general form
Ui [xi ; ci (xi ; x i ); yi + Y i ; di (yi ; y i )] ;

(1)

where the utility function is concave and weakly increasing in all four arguments, but strictly
increasing in xi and yi . The functions ci ( ; ) and di ( ; ) are assumed to be concave in their
…rst argument (xi and yi , respectively) and continuous in all arguments. An important
feature of the utility function is that both consumption and donation have multiple nonlinear
characteristics. The quantities xi and yi provide the agent utility through the amount of
4

private consumption and the total level of public good provision, respectively. These same
quantities also provide utility to agent i through the functions ci ( ; ) and di ( ; ), which also
depend on the corresponding quantities x i and y i for all other agents in the economy.
Notice that the utility function in (1) is a special case of the more general speci…cation Ui [xi ; x i ; yi ; y i ]. While the more general speci…cation could, in principle, be the
starting point for our analysis, it is known that such general preferences impose only trivial
restrictions for revealed-preference tests in models with externalities (Carvajal 2010; Deb
2009). Intuitively, this occurs because changes in the level of externalities create a large
degree of ‡exibility in utility functions to rationalize revealed preferences. By adopting the
utility function in (1), however, we impose structure on the agents’preferences that is both
reasonable and intuitive in the context of private provision of a public good. This, as we will
show, allows us to consider a class of preferences that are general enough to subsume several
existing and novel models while simultaneously imposing nontrivial restrictions to test on observed data. Moreover, the speci…c cases that we consider demonstrate how the framework
remains general enough to account for multiple externalities and multiple characteristics
arising from xi and yi .
We begin with the standard models of privately provided public goods. Keeping only
the …rst and third arguments of (1) yields preferences of the form Ui (xi ; Y ), which are consistent with the classic public goods model (e.g., Bergstrom et al. 1986). Agents obtain
utility from their own private consumption and the aggregate level of the public good. Following convention, we refer to this case as pure altruism. If, instead, we keep only the …rst
and fourth arguments under the additional assumption that di (yi ; y i ) = yi , the result is
a model of warm glow, with preferences Ui (xi ; yi ) that are consistent with those speci…ed
by Andreoni and Miller (2002).6 Moreover, considering both of these cases simultaneously
generates preferences of the form Ui (xi ; Y; yi ), and these match those for the model of impure
altruism (Andreoni 1988, 1990).
The preferences speci…ed in (1) can also accommodate social comparisons whereby
agents are concerned with how their own donation, private consumption, or both compare
with those of others. The argument di (yi ; y i ) is intended to capture preferences for relative
donation, as the functional form can account for one’s own donation and any possible subset
of others’ donations.7 The way we model such concerns is to specify di (yi ; y i ) = yi
6
Recall that Andreoni and Miller (2002) refer to these preferences as altruistic because yi re‡ects the
payo¤ to the responder in a dictator game. In the context of private provision of a public good, however, the
preferences are more commonly referred to as consistent with warm glow, re‡ecting that fact that donations
may arise even without any concern for the overall level of the public good.

Romano and Yildirim (2001) consider special cases of di (yi ; y i ) to study phenomena such as the “snob”
and “bandwagon” e¤ects in a sequential move game of charitable giving.

which implies that individuals care about how their donation compares with the mean
donation of other agents in the economy. When this term is active in the utility function, we
refer to it as relative donation. Note that an advantage of our setup, which we exploit later,
is that relative donation can be combined with pure altruism and warm glow. It turns out,
however, that no additional revealed-preference restrictions are imposed when combining
relative donation with impure altruism, which we show formally later in the paper.
We also consider social comparisons based on relative private consumption. To gain
intuition for why relative consumption might be important and di¤erent from relative donation, consider an individual trying to decide how much she will donate to a local public
good. Suppose she is considering a $10 donation, but …nds out that a friend with twice her
income has also donated $10. From a social comparison perspective, it is easy to envision
how an agent might be reluctant to donate as much when others in the economy are proportionally less generous. It is, however, important to recognize that the idea here is distinct
from concern about relative donation. To see how, change the scenario so that the friend still
donates $10 but now has half the relative income. This situation, in contrast, could easily
encourage the agent to donate more. But, importantly, both of these scenarios are treated
identically in models where agents care only about the donations of others, while ignoring
others’wealth and therefore levels of private consumption. Introducing relative consumption
to models of charitable giving thus endows agents with preferences that may depend on the
relative philanthropy of others, rather than the absolute amount donated.
The argument ci (xi ; x i ) is intended to capture preferences for relative consumption.
While there exists a substantial literature on the importance of relative consumption in consumer behavior (e.g., Duesenberry 1949; Boskin and Sheshinki 1978; Layard 1980; Ljungqvist
and Uhlig 2000; Luttmer 2005), we are aware of only one model that considers it in the context of public goods, but the focus is on implications for taxation (Aronsson and JohanssonStenman 2008). Following convention in the literature and in parallel with our treatment of
relative donation, we specify ci (xi ; x i ) = xi NX i1 , which implies that agents care about
how their private consumption compares with average consumption in the economy when
deciding how much to donate.8 When this term is active in the utility function, we refer to
it as relative consumption. In what follows, we consider cases in which relative consumption
is combined with pure altruism, warm glow, impure altruism, and relative donation.
8

An alternative way to model both relative consumption and donation is to assume that agents care about
the ratio of their own consumption or donation to the corresponding mean of others in the economy. This
xi
i
would imply ci (xi ; x i ) = X=N
and di (yi ; y i ) = Yy=N
. While our theoretical framework readily accommodates these alternatives, and we also conducted the revealed-preference analysis for these speci…cations,
we do not report the results here because they are very similar, and we think the speci…cations themselves
have less intuitive appeal. Later in the paper, we also consider the possibility of social comparisons based
on di¤erence aversion.

6

Before turning to our methodology for conducting revealed-preference tests, we illustrate why the models just discussed, with the exception of warm glow, add complications to
the standard revealed-preference framework. Using the example of relative consumption of
the form Ui (xi ; xi NX i1 ; Y ), Figure 1 illustrates the budget frontier of an agent that seeks
to maximize utility subject to px xi + py yi wi . The frontier is simply the line segment AB
in the three-dimensional characteristics space. The point A denotes the allocation when all
wi is spent on xi , and B denotes the allocation when all wi is spend on yi . Now consider
an observed choice on the interior, say at point C. While the indi¤erence curve must be
tangent to AB, the relative prices of all three characteristics, which are necessary to test
revealed preferences, are not de…ned by the budget frontier alone. Utility maximization
implies that there exists a plane DBE that includes AB and is also tangent to the agent’s
indi¤erence curve. The gradients of this plane, which depend on the budget frontier and the
agent’s utility function, de…ne shadow prices of the characteristics that depend not only on
the observed prices px and py , but also wi and the two externalities of Y i and NX i1 .9 Hence,
conducting revealed-preference tests in this environment, where any of the exogenous variables (px ; py ; wi ; Y i ; NX i1 ) can be changing, hinges on whether there exists a well-behaved
utility function and shadow prices for di¤erent allocation choices that are consistent with
rational choice. This is, of course, di¤erent than standard tests for which budget sets are
clearly de…ned with exogenous prices and income, and application of the Generalized Axiom
of Revealed Preference (GARP) is relatively straightforward. We now turn to our methodological approach for carrying out such tests, which also accommodates the possibility of
corner solutions.

2.2

Revealed-Preference Tests

We describe the conceptual framework for revealed-preference tests of models consistent with
the preferences speci…ed in (1). The approach accounts for characteristics and externalities
of the type discussed previously. By de…nition, agent i’s allocation choice (xi ; yi ) is a best
response to the choices of the other agents (x i ; y i ) if
(xi ; yi ) 2 arg max fUi [x; ci (x; x i ); y + Y i ; di (y; y i )] : px x + py y
(x;y)

9

wi g :

In the public goods literature, these unobserved shadow prices are sometimes referred to as virtual prices
(see Cornes and Sandler 1996).

7

Figure 1: Budget set in characteristics space for the model of relative consumption

8

We denote agent i’s set of best responses as Bi (x i ; y i ; px ; py ; wi ). A vector of choices
(x ; y ) is thus an equilibrium if for all i = 1; :::; N , it holds that
(xi ; yi ) 2 Bi (x i ; y i ; px ; py ; wi ):
Because the model’s setup constitutes a concave game, equilibrium existence is guaranteed
(Rosen 1965).10 While there may be more than one equilibrium, establishing uniqueness is
not necessary for our purposes.
In general, the revealed-preference approach involves the examination of a panel of
choices made by agents across di¤erent budget sets. Consider a series of choices from
t = 1; :::; T in which each agent i faces changing prices, endowments, and choices made
by other agents. The set of T choices for all N agents produces a data set of the form
f(ptx ; pty ; xt ; yt )gTt=1 , which characterizes all choices and exogenous variables. Note that endowments are de…ned implicitly as wit = ptx xti + pty yit . For any such data set, it is straightforward within the context of our model to de…ne the notion of rationalization that provides
the basis for revealed-preference tests.
De…nition 1 Given a data set D = f(ptx ; pty ; xt ; yt )gTt=1 and functions fci ; di gN
i=1 , agent i’s
choices in D are rationalized if there exists a time-invariant utility function Ui such that for
all t, the observed data satis…es
(xti ; yit ) 2 Bi (xt i ; yt i ; ptx ; pty ; ptx xti + pty yit ):
Moreover, the entire data set D is rationalized if the choices of all agents i = 1; :::; N are
rationalized.
It follows that rationalization of an agent’s choices involves …nding a utility function
such that the best response of an agent to the choices of others with respect to that function
yields all of the agent’s observed choices. This, in turn, implies that if the choices of all
agents can be rationalized, there exist preferences such that the observed data corresponds
to an equilibrium. Note that rationalization allows for complete heterogeneity across agents.
The analysis is done separately for each individual and therefore imposes no requirement
that Ui be the same for di¤erent individuals. Though we consider homogenous speci…cations
for ci and di in our experiment (discussed in the next section), the framework is general
enough to admit heterogeneity of these functions as well. Allowing for such heterogeneity is,
of course, one of the primary advantages of studying behavior using revealed preferences.
10

The assumptions on Ui , ci , and di imply that each agent i’s utility function is continuous in (x; y)
and concave in (xi ; yi ) for all …xed (x i ; y i ). Moreover, each agent’s strategy set is compact and convex.
Together, these conditions imply a concave game.

9

The following theorem, which we prove in Appendix A, formally states the conditions
that underlie the revealed-preference tests of our model.

Theorem 1 Given a data set D = f(ptx ; pty ; xt ; yt )gTt=1 and functions fci ; di gN

ci xti ; xt i and dti = di yit ; yt i , the following statements are equivalent:

1. There exists a utility function Ui of the form (1) that rationalizes the choices of agent
i in D.

The theorem states that an agent’s choices can be rationalized if and only if the a set of
linear inequalities has a solution. The inequalities are based on the …rst-order conditions,
the concavity restrictions on the utility function, and the relative consumption and donation
functions. Commonly referred to as Afriat (1967) inequalities, the conditions enable explicit
construction of utility levels and the marginal utility of income associated with each agent’s
observation t; that is, they de…ne a utility level Uit = Ui [xti ; ci xti ; xt i ; yit + Y t i ; di yit ; yt i ]
and a marginal utility of income ti associated with the endowment ptx xti + pty yit for each
observed (xt ; yt ). The unobserved shadow prices of characteristics are re‡ected, in part,
through the values of ti , ti , ti , and ti , which themselves represent marginal utilities for
the corresponding characteristrics. Simply dividing them by the Lagrange multiplier on the
budget constraint, ti , therefore, reveals the shadow prices. A useful feature of the theorem’s
proof, as shown in Appendix A, is that it is constructive, meaning that when an agent’s
choices can be rationalized, the proof provides a candidate utility function. Because the
inequalities are linear in the unknowns, it is also simple and computationally e¢ cient to
verify whether they have a solution.
We use the example of impure altruism to illustrate the key inequalities for revealedpreference tests of that particular model.
Example 1 Recall that impure altruism implies ci (xi ; x i ) = 0 and di (yi ; y i ) = yi for
the utility function speci…ed in (1). The inequalities corresponding with the conditions in

This example shows that for a data set D = f(ptx ; pty ; xt ; yt )gTt=1 agent i’s choices can be
rationalized by the impure altruism model if and only if the derived system of linear inequalities has a solution for non-negative ti , ti , ti and positive ti and Uit . If a solution exists, we
cannot reject optimizing behavior; whereas if a solution does not exist, the agent’s choices
are inconsistent with optimizing behavior. It is therefore possible to derive pass rates for
di¤erent models among agents to compare how models are more or less successful at explaining the repeated choices of subjects. Because it is straightforward, we do not derive the
explicit inequalities for testing the other models discussed previously, but we use them when
carrying out the tests reported later in the paper.
It is worth mentioning that the impure altruism application of our theorem is related
to the revealed-preference tests in Korenok et al. (2011). They provide separate necessary
and su¢ cient conditions (their theorem and result, respectively) for impure altruism to
rationalize a given data set. Their su¢ cient condition states that in order for the data to
satisfy GARP, there must be shadow prices for the characteristics such that the data can
be rationalized in characteristic space. The intuition follows from our previous discussion of
Figure 1. Our approach di¤ers, however, in that a solution to the inequalities in Example 1

provides exactly such shadow prices : it for altruism and it for warm glow, in addition to

= ptx for private consumption. It is thus possible to show that their su¢ cient condition
is closely related to the inequalities in our example. Beyond the fact that our framework
is more general than impure altruism, a further di¤erence between approaches is the ease
of application. Following the steps of Korenok et al. (2011), one must search over the
space of shadow prices to …nd a price vector that satis…es rational choice, but there is no
general algorithm to …nd these shadow prices in a …nite number of steps.11 Moreover, if such
prices are not found, it remains unclear whether the reason is because the search algorithm
failed or because they do not exist. In contrast, our inequalities are in the form of a linear
program, and there are well-known algorithms to check feasibility and solve systems of linear
inequalities.
11

The computational problem is similar to the one encountered by Varian (1983), who derives revealedpreference tests of weak functional separability.

Experiment Design

We design an experiment that allows us to test and di¤erentiate among models of charitable
giving using our revealed-preference framework. Each subject is tasked with making a series
of allocation choices between oneself and donating to a charitable cause. While our experiment has several features in common with Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Korenok et al.
(2011), one important di¤erence is that we study giving to a local non-pro…t organization
rather than another anonymous subject in the lab. Using notation from the previous section,
subjects are asked to make allocation choices fxti ; yit gTt=1 in scenarios with changing values
of the subject’s endowment (wit ), prices of private consumption (ptx ) and charitable donation
(pty ), others’private consumption (xt i ), and others’charitable giving (y t i ).12
The fact that we study how subjects respond to the choices of other subjects necessitates an experimental design with two distinct cohorts, denoted A and B. The primary
purpose of Cohort-A, as we will explain, is to generate allocation choices for subsequent
use with Cohort-B. All subjects in our actual experiment were volunteers among the undergraduate student population at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and
all experimental sessions took place during May and June 2011, with recruitment using an
online system (Greiner 2004). Because our experimental procedures did not vary greatly between cohorts, we …rst describe those for Cohort-A and then identify important di¤erences
for Cohort-B.
Cohort-A subjects were asked to make choices about splitting an endowment between
oneself and the Hoosic River Watershed Association (HooRWA), which is a non-pro…t organization dedicated to the restoration, conservation, and enjoyment of the Hoosic River and
its watershed. The Hoosic River ‡ows by the Williams campus, and students are generally
familiar with HooRWA because of its presence in a small town and o¢ ces in a non-college
building near the center of campus. Because HooRWA is a relatively small non-pro…t organization, it is reasonable to assume that subjects might consider their donations to be
meaningful. At the beginning of each session, subjects received a copy of the instructions
(included in Appendix B) that were read aloud. After hearing the instructions and before
making their choices, subjects were required to successfully calculate the earnings associated with two hypothetical scenarios, and these review questions were conducted using the
software program z-Tree (Fischbacher 2007).
The actual choices— 20 in total for each subject— were made using pencil and paper.
For each choice, the subject was given a token endowment and informed of the value per token

that X t i = xt i = xt i and Y t i = yt i = y t i .

for private consumption and charitable donation. Tokens translated into a di¤erent number
of points for consumption and donation, and each point was worth 10 cents. Each choice
was also associated with separate and unchangeable endowments of points for HooRWA and
another randomly paired subject in the current session, referred to as a match.13 Each subject
was then asked to divide tokens between those to hold for private consumption and those to
pass for donation to HooRWA. The following summarizes the details and presentation of an
example scenario:

Each subject …lled out a choice sheet that included the 20 scenarios in randomized
order. Table 1 lists the 20 Cohort-A scenarios, along with the mean number and percentage
of tokens passed for each scenario. Cohort-A consisted of 36 subjects from three equally
sized sessions of 12 participants. The sessions lasted approximately one hour, and payment
to subjects was based on one randomly selected scenario, which determined payments to the
subject, HooRWA, and the subject’s match. A Cohort-A subject’s payment thus consisted
of two parts: points per tokens kept in the randomly selected scenario plus the points from
serving as another subject’s match. Payments were made at the end of the session using
a double-blind procedure (Ho¤man, McCabe and Smith 1996) to limit giving induced by
strategic altruism. The total payment per subject, which included the two parts, was $17.61
on average, and the average payment to HooRWA was $8.96 per subject, which included the
initial points plus the donated points.
As mentioned previously, Cohort-B is the main focus of our experiment, and the primary purpose of Cohort-A was to generate scenarios for Cohort-B. Readers will have noticed
that our Cohort-A initial points for both the randomly matched subject and HooRWA were
synthetic constructs for xt i and y t i . Because they were not based on the choices of actual
subjects, Cohort-A is of limited (though useful, as we will show) value for testing the importance of social comparisons. Cohort-B di¤ers because we use the previous choices of subjects
to produce real values for xt i and y t i that conform to the No Deception Rule in economic experiments.14 In other words, the task of Cohort-B subjects closely mirrored that of Cohort-A
13

The reason for including a match in Cohort-A will become clear when we describe Cohort-B, as it is
important for subjects in both cohorts to face similarly structured scenarios.
14
This norm is largely based on the belief that deception will adversely impact the ability of subsequent
experimenters to maintain experimental control (e.g., Friedman and Sunder 1994). In fact, Karlan, Jamison and Schecter (2008) …nd that deception a¤ects both a subject’s likelihood of returning for subsequent
experiments and the choices that are made conditional on returning.

with the important exception that the initial points given to Cohort-B are actual allocation
decisions made by Cohort-A subjects. Speci…cally, Cohort-A and Cohort-B subjects faced
20 scenarios with the same endowments and prices, but each scenario for Cohort-B was
associated with a previous Cohort-A subject’s chosen points for private consumption and
HooRWA when the subject faced the same endowment and prices. The following summarizes
the details and presentation of an example Cohort-B scenario:

It is also important to mention that we explicitly informed Cohort-B subjects that their
choices would not be presented to subsequent subjects.
The …rst six columns of Table 2 report the 20 scenarios that all Cohort-B subjects
received in randomized order. There were 120 subjects in Cohort-B from 9 sessions with
a mean size just over 13 and ranging between 12 and 17. Table 2 also reports the average
number and percentage of tokens passed for each scenario. While the Previous Participant
Choice for private consumption and HooRWA are based on actual decisions, the CohortA choices we that presented to Cohort-B were not selected at random nor presented as
such. Rather, our objective was to select “realistic” choices that would give subjects ample
opportunity to make allocation decisions that are inconsistent with our theoretical models
of interest. To accomplish this, we experimented with Bronars (1987) ex ante test for the
likelihood that random and uniformly distributed choices in each of the scenarios would
result in a panel of choices inconsistent with each speci…ed utility model. Our approach was
somewhat ad hoc given that we are testing several di¤erent models, but as we discuss in
the next section, the scenarios that we put forth in Cohort-B produce Bronars results with
su¢ cient power to ensure plenty of scope for rejecting models.
Appendix C includes the Cohort-B instruction sheet, and the procedures closely followed that for Cohort-A. One di¤erence was that to compensate for the fact that Cohort-A
subjects received a match payment ($4.20 on average), each Cohort-B subject received a $5
participation payment in addition to the point earnings on the one randomly selected scenario. Another point of clari…cation about payo¤s is that for Cohort-B’s randomly selected

Experiment Results

We focus analysis of the results on how di¤erent models of charitable giving rationalize the
choices of our experimental subjects. As discussed previously, we consider standard models of
privately provided public goods, along with novel models that account for social comparisons.
We focus throughout on Cohort-B, but consider some comparisons with Cohort-A as part of
robustness checks at the end of the section.

4.1

Preliminaries

With experimental studies, it is often useful to begin with comparisons of subject behavior to
other experiments as a check of representativeness, but direct comparisons are not possible
in our case because the experimental design has several unique features. We nevertheless
compare selected results with those in Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Korenok et al. (2011).
Andreoni and Miller’s (2002) experiment is based on a panel of choices in a dictator game
with changing prices and endowments, and Korenok et al. (2011) have a similar design that
also includes changing initial endowments of the recipient. Recall that our design di¤ers
because (i) subjects are making donations to a local non-pro…t organization rather than
another anonymous subject in the lab, and (ii) subjects are informed of another’s choices
for private consumption and donation when faced with the same choice scenario.
Despite di¤erences in the experimental design, several of the standard comparisons are
surprisingly similar. The “perfectly sel…sh” strategy of keeping all tokens for oneself in all
20 choice scenarios was played by 22.7 percent of our subjects, compared to the identical
percentage and 25.2 percent for Andreoni and Miller (2002) and Korenok et al. (2011),
respectively.15 Another commonly referenced strategy is to maximize the aggregate payo¤,
in which case points held and passed are perfect substitutes. We …nd that 2.5 percent of
our subjects played this strategy compared to 6.2 and 1.6 percent for the other studies,
respectively. When faced with a price ratio of px =py = 1 (i.e., scenarios 10 and 11 in Table
15

Unless otherwise indicated, percentages for our experiment are based on 119 Cohort-B subjects. We
dropped one Cohort-B subject because of subject confusion. The subject wrote down the di¤erence between
the additional number of tokens desired to pass and the number the previous participant passed, meaning
that the subject was erroneously constrained to passing at least as many as the previous participant.

17

2), the token pass rate of our subjects was 20.6 percent compared to 23.0 and 22.9 percent
for the other studies, respectively, when faced with the same prices for holding and passing
tokens.
Though not a central part of our analysis, we also estimate an average demand function
for donations in order to verify that our subjects make choices consistent with standard
economic theory on charitable giving. In particular, we estimate the following …xed-e¤ects
model:
yit = ptyi + ptxi + wit + y t i + i + "it ,
where yit is the contribution of subject i in scenario t measured in points; ptyi is the price
of contribution points in terms of tokens (i.e., the inverse of points per passed in Table 2);
ptxi is the price of private consumption points in terms of tokens (i.e., the inverse of points
per held in Table 2); wit is the token endowment; y t i is the previous participant choice of
HooRWA points; i is a subject-speci…c intercept; and "it is the error term. A useful feature
of this speci…cation is that coe¢ cients are identi…ed o¤ of variation within subjects. Table 3
reports the coe¢ cient estimates and corresponding elasticities. We …nd that the results are
consistent with theory. While the income e¤ect is statistically insigni…cant, donations are
decreasing in the price of making a donation, increasing in the price of private consumption
(consistent with donations being a gross substitute for private consumption), and decreasing
in the previous participant’s contribution level. In terms of magnitudes, the estimates imply
that the crowding out at 14 cents per dollar is substantially less than one-for-one, and the
price elasticity of giving is approximately -0.4.
We now turn attention to the use of revealed preferences for testing models. When
conducting such tests, it is important to ensure that they have “power”; that is, useful tests
are those that provide subjects ample opportunity to make choices that are inconsistent
with the model being tested. The Bronars’(1987) Power Index is the most commonly used
criteria for evaluating the power of revealed-preference tests. It produces the probability
that a random and uniformly distributed set of choices on the budget sets for a series of
choice scenarios will violate revealed-preference tests.
Table 4 lists the di¤erent models that we consider, by name and utility function, along
with Bronars results for each, given the scenarios presented to Cohort-B of our experiment.
To facilitate interpretation, we report a modi…ed version of the standard Bronar’s Index:
the percentage of random draws that are consistent with the corresponding model, rather
than the proportion that are inconsistent. We …nd a high degree of power across all models.
For example, based on simulations of random and uniformly distributed choices of 50,000
subjects, only 0.04 percent are consistent with warm-glow preferences, meaning that 99.96
percent are inconsistent with the model. With more general utility functions, the power

declines, but even for relative consumption + relative donation, only 20.37 percent of the
simulated subjects are consistent with the model. While di¤erent utility functions yield
di¤erent degrees of power, the general strength of the tests reported in Table 4 is due to our
selection of budget sets with a large number of intersections and su¢ cient variation in the
Cohort-A choices that we report in the scenarios for Cohort-B.

4.2

Revealed-Preference Tests and Model Comparisons

The last column of Table 4 reports the percent of Cohort-B subjects that actually made
choices consistent with each model.16 These percentages are derived by implementation of
the tests based on Theorem 1. We carried out the analysis in MATLAB using a linear
programme solver. The solver tests whether the feasible region corresponding to the linear
inequalities of Theorem 1 is non-empty, in which case there is a solution to the inequalities,
and the choices can be rationalized. In all cases, the percentage of subjects whose choices are
rationalized by the model is substantially higher than the ex ante Bronars results, indicating
16

As mentioned in footnote 15, the percentages are based on 119 subjects. Eight choices among the total
of 119 20 = 2; 380 required a bit of data cleaning due to simple mathematical error on the part of subjects
allocating too few or many tokens. For these observations we conducted all analyses under two alternative
assumptions: that tokens passed was correct and adjusted tokens held accordingly, and that tokens held
was correct and adjusted tokens passed accordingly. We …nd that the results do not change under the two
di¤erent assumptions.

on 119 Cohort-B subjects.

that the models meaningfully explain subject behavior. For example, nearly 50 percent of
the subjects made choices consistent with warm-glow preferences, and relative consumption
+ relative donation rationalizes the choices of more than 94 percent of the subjects. These
numbers compare to 0.04 and 20.37 percent for the Bonars results, respectively. Taken as a
whole, this pattern of results suggests that, despite di¤erences among models, optimization
in one form or another helps to explain a substantial amount of the subjects’ charitable
giving. The set of results in Table 4 also demonstrate how our framework can be used to
carry out revealed-preference tests based on an array of models with both externalities and
characteristics.
We now focus on comparisons among the models of charitable giving in order to make
judgments about which perform better. In doing so, it is important to recognize that we
are testing models with varying degrees of power and generality on the same data set. This
means that valid comparisons among models must account not only for the percentage of
data rationalized, but also the di¤ering power of tests. A recent paper by Beatty and
Crawford (2011) provides a methodology for making such comparisons, and we follow their
recommendation here. Let a denote the Bronars measure that we report in Table 4. The
percentage a can be interpreted as a measure of the set of choices de…ned by the revealedpreference restrictions relative to the set of all possible choices. If a is 100, the revealedpreference test almost surely imposes no restrictions; whereas if a is 0, choices can almost
surely never pass the revealed-preference test. The explanatory power of a given model
must therefore depend on the percentage of data rationalized, denoted r, and the “target”
area in consumption space a. There are many possible functions de…ned on (r; a) that
could be chosen, with some intuitive candidates being r a and r=a. Beatty and Crawford

(2011) argue, however, that a desirable measure should satisfy the three basic axioms of
monotonicity, equivalence, and aggregability. They also prove that only the function r a
(and a¢ ne transformations of it) satis…es the axioms and recommend using the measure for
evaluating the performance of models. We therefore base our comparisons on this measure
and conclude that models with a higher r a perform better.17
Figure 2 illustrates these power adjusted results for all models. The di¤erences, r a
for each model, are shown for all Cohort-B subjects as the …rst set of histogram bars. Also
shown in Figure 2 are bars that exclude the 27 “purely sel…sh”subjects that never donated
in any of the 20 choice scenarios. We report the second set of results as a simple point
of comparison because all of the models rationalize the choices of non-donating subjects,
making di¤erences among models appear less stark.
We begin with the standard models. Warm glow and pure altruism are distinct models
17
It is possible to conduct approximate rationality tests in our setting as well. One approach would be
to calculate the Critical Cost E¢ ciency Index (CCEI) of Afriat (1972). Intuitively, this approach involves
…nding the degree to which the budget sets of subjects need to be relaxed in order to rationalize their choices.
We do not, however, conduct this analysis for two reasons. First, our focus in on demonstrating applicability
of our theoretical framework and comparing various models rather than testing and justifying a single model;
and for comparing models, an approximate measure is not necessary. Second, Beatty and Crawford (2011)
make the important observation that relaxing budget sets also changes the power of tests, and taking this
into account reveals that the CCEI approach is more ad hoc than employing standard thresholds (e.g., the
conventional 95-percent rule) often implies.

21

in the sense that neither subsumes the other. This follows because with warm glow, two
scenarios in which xi and yi are the same but Y i di¤ers will yield the same level of utility,
whereas the same scenarios will yield two di¤erent levels of utility for pure altruism. Similarly,
two scenarios in which xi and yi + Y i are the same but yi di¤ers will yield the same utility
for pure altruism and di¤erent levels of utility for warm glow. A well-known di¤erence is
that pure altruism allows for crowding out while warm glow does not. The power of both
tests on our data is very strong, and both models …t the data reasonably well, rationalizing
50 and 58 percent of the data for warm glow and pure altruism, respectively (Table 4). After
making the power adjustments (Figure 2), we …nd that pure altruism …ts the data better by
8.2 and 10.6 percentage points with and without the “sel…sh” subjects, respectively. These
results suggest that, in the context of our experiment, donations appear to operate like a
public good because crowding out plays a role in explaining donation levels.
The comparison of these two models with impure altruism is somewhat di¤erent because impure altruism nests the other two. This implies that impure altruism will rationalize
all of the data that are rationalized by either warm glow or pure altruism. The question is
thus whether the generalization meaningfully improves the goodness of …t after making the
power adjustment. We …nd that it does, increasing the …t by 14.6 and 19.2 percentage points
beyond pure altruism with and without the “sel…sh”subjects respectively. The contrast with
warm glow is even more substantial, at 22.8 and 29.8 percentage points, respectively. Note
that the latter conclusion— that impure altruism has greater explanatory power than warm
glow— accords with the results of Korenok et al.’s (2011) experiment. It is worth keeping in
mind, however, that our results are based on giving to a charity, while their results are based
on giving to another subject in the lab. Overall, our tests of these standard models indicate
that crowding out plays an important role in charitable giving, and allowing the crowding
out to be less than one-for-one, as with impure altruism, strengthens the conclusion even
more.
We now turn to the more novel models that account for social comparisons. First
consider the model of relative donation, which rationalizes 84 percent of the data before
making the power adjustment. After the adjustment, the numbers are 80.1 and 75.5 percent
with and without the “sel…sh”subjects, respectively. This is 7.9 and 10.9 percentage points
more than the adjusted results for impure altruism; however, it is important to consider
whether the models are independent or one nests the other. In this case, it is a bit more
subtle than we have encountered previously, but it can be shown that relative donation is a
generalization of impure altruism. To prove this, consider a utility function of the form
U~i [xi ; yi + Y i ; (yi + Y i ) + (yi

which is non-decreasing and concave in all three arguments, and ;

While it is straightforward to see that this utility function is a special case of relative donation, we can also show that it is a generalization of impure altruism. Imposing the restrictions that = 1=N and = (N 1)=N yields the impure altruism utility function of
U~i = U~i [xi ; yi + Y i ; yi ]. The important empirical question, therefore, is not whether relative
donation rationalizes more of the data, but again, whether the di¤erence is empirically meaningful. Based on the numbers referenced above, we conclude that the additional explanatory
power of relative donation is meaningful, increasing the goodness of …t from impure altruism
by more than half the amount that impure altruism does compared to pure altruism.
A notable feature of the model of relative consumption is that it does not nest impure
altruism. While it is also independent of relative donation and warm glow, relative consumption does subsume pure altruism. This follows because none of the other models depend on
X i , and relative consumption has two arguments that are identical to those for pure altruism. We …nd that relative consumption rationalizes 85.7 percent of the data. After making
the power adjustment, the numbers are 81.1 and 76.9 percent with and without the “sel…sh”
subjects, respectively. How does this compare to impure altruism, which might be considered a competing model? Relative consumption performs better with adjusted di¤erences of
8.9 and 12.3 percentage points with and without the “sel…sh” subjects. We interpret these
results as strong evidence that how one’s level of philanthropy compares to others, scaled
by income, helps to explain decisions about charitable giving; for both relative giving and
endowments enter the model implicitly because of the exogenous levels of y t i and xt i that
each agent i observes when making allocation choices.18
The other results shown in Table 4 and Figure 2 are further generalizations of the utility
function. We consider relative consumption + impure altruism and relative consumption +
relative donation. One reason for including these cases is to demonstrate the ‡exibility of the
revealed-preference framework that we develop for testing a variety of di¤erent preference
structures. The experimental results show that both generalizations rationalize more than
90 percent of the data (Table 4). But after making the power adjustments, these models
have less explanatory power than relative consumption on its own (Figure 2). We conclude,
18
We also use our framework to test an alternative model of relative consumption that considers di¤erence
aversion. This admits the possibility that individuals care not about whether their private consumption is
more or less than that of others, but only about the absolute di¤erence is private consumption. Speci…cally,
X i 2
we consider a utility function of the form Ui [xi ; (xi N
1 ) ; Y ] and …nd that it performs similar to impure
altruism, but less well than relative consumption. The Bronars result is 0.72, and considering all subjects,
the percent of subjects rationalized is 76.47, with a power adjusted percentage of 75.75. Excluding the
non-contributing subjects, the power adjusted percentage is 68.84. It is also worth mentioning that a similar
analysis can be carried out for di¤erence aversion related to donations, and this underscores the generality
of our framework for testing many types of models.

therefore, that these generalizations do not have “signi…cant”e¤ects.

Robustness Checks

A potential concern with our analysis is that one of the 20 choice scenarios is having undue
in‡uence over the results. This could a¤ect the tests of a particular model, comparisons
among them, or both. To evaluate sensitivity of our results to any particular scenario,
we replicate the analysis 20 times, dropping one scenario each time. That is, we exclude
each scenario once and conduct the analysis on the remaining 19 scenarios. Note that each
replication requires new Bronars results and revealed-preference tests for each replication,
as the power of each test di¤ers with changes in the included set of scenarios.
Figure 3 summarizes the replication results. The histogram bars represent the means
of the power adjusted results for the corresponding model, with and without the noncontributing subjects. Hence, the bars illustrate the mean results in parallel with the results
in Figure 2. The whiskers on each bar indicate the minimum and maximum of the power
adjusted results across the 20 replications. We …nd little variation in the explanatory power
within models and no change in the comparisons across models based on the mean results.

Notes: We report a modi…ed version of the standard Bronars index: the
percentage of random draws that are consistent with the corresponding
model, rather than the proportion that are inconsistent. These results are
based on 50,000 replications. Percent of subjects rationalized by each model
is based on 36 Cohort-A subjects.

We therefore conclude that any one scenario is not critical to the overall pattern of results.
For the …nal part of our analysis, we return to Cohort-A, which provides a useful
comparison with Cohort-B given that our main experimental results are on the importance
of relative consumption and donation. Recall that the di¤erence between cohorts is the way
that subjects were informed about xt i and y t i . These values were simply asserted for CohortA as part of the experimental design, while they were reported (without deception) as the
result of a previous subject’s choices to Cohort-B.19 Given this di¤erence, it is reasonable to
expect that while concerns about relative consumption and donation help explain Cohort-B
behavior, that same pattern should not be apparent in Cohort-A, as the comparisons for
these subjects are not with the choices of another subject. While we recognize that the
Cohort-A sample size is relatively small, we nevertheless make the comparison because it
produces a useful counterfactual where values for xt i and y t i do not arise from another
subject’s choices.
Table 5 reports the Cohort-A Bronars results and the percentage of subjects rationalized by each model in parallel with the results for Cohort-B in Table 4. The more useful
comparisons, however, are the power adjusted results illustrated in Figure 4. With respect
to the standard models, we …nd a similar pattern to that shown previously for Cohort-B: the
explanatory power increases as we move from warm glow to pure altruism, and even more so
for impure altruism. But the pattern di¤ers in relation to the additional explanatory power
19
It is an aside but worth mentioning that none of our Cohort-B subjects mirror the distribution of
allocation choices of the previous Cohort-A subject. Thus, while we have shown that Cohort-B subjects
respond to the social comparisons, they do not abdicate their allocation responsibilities and simply mirror
the behavior of others.

of models that account for relative donation, relative consumption, or both. We …nd that
after making the Bonars adjustments these modes have less explanatory power than impure
altruism. This result, of course, di¤ers from that for Cohort-B, where relative consumption
and donation added signi…cant explanatory power. We interpret the contrasting results between cohorts as further evidence in support of the …nding that social comparisons— based
on choices made by others in a similar environment— are important explanatory factors of
charitable giving.

Conclusion

The methodological contribution in this paper is a general, revealed-preference approach for
testing models of charitable giving. The approach di¤ers from standard tests of GARP because it accommodates the characteristics approach to specifying utility functions and externalities imposed by other agents— two features that are common to most models of charitable
giving. At the most general level, the approach requires only that utility functions be concave, weakly increasing, and continuous in the externalities. But, as we have shown, imposing
further structure is both reasonable and intuitive in the context of charitable giving, and it
leads to nontrivial testable restrictions that increase the value of revealed-preference tests.
26

While we have considered a number of standard and novel preference structures throughout
the paper, many more are possible and readily accommodated within our framework. We
therefore hope the techniques demonstrated here open the door to greater use of revealedpreference analysis in future research on charitable giving. Towards this end, it is worth
mentioning that the revealed-preference techniques described herein can also be applied to
cross-sectional data sets, whereby one can pool observations that are similar in observables to
form the analog of a panel used here. Moreover, our main theorem for conducting revealedpreference tests is even more general than our experimental application: while the of our
experiment is based on the second player in a two-player sequential game, the theory applies
equally to multi-agent simultaneous games.
Our experimental design shows how revealed preferences can be used to test several
models on the same data set. The results provide evidence on the importance of social comparisons for understanding decisions about the level of one’s charitable contributions. Some
of our results are consistent with those of Korenok et al. (2011) on the importance of impure
altruism, but our application considers actual charitable giving rather than payo¤s to another laboratory subject. In terms of explaining subject choices, we …nd that impure altruism
performs markedly better than the special cases of warm-glow giving and pure altruism. The
more novel …ndings, however, are that models based on relative preferences for either private
consumption or levels of donation yield meaningful di¤erences in the explanatory power over
and above the standard model of impure altruism. Speci…c features of our experimental
design and revealed-preference tests also ensure that subject behavior is not being driven by
other social motives such as signaling about charity quality, prestige, and signaling about
income. Notably, because subjects receive 20 choice scenarios in randomized order on the
same sheet, key features such the charitable cause and choice environment are held constant,
leaving social comparisons as the only variable other than standard parameters that a¤ect
budget constraints.
Finally, we conclude with reasons why one might expect social comparisons to play
even a more important role on charitable behavior outside our laboratory setting. On the
surface, it may seem that our experiment is biased against a …nding that social comparisons
are important. Subjects in Cohort-B, who provide the main results, are informed about the
choices of a “previous participant,”and it is quite reasonable to expect that subjects would
want to resist manipulation of their choices based on the assumption that the experimenter
selected particularly altruistic choices of the previous participant. In addition, the previous
participant is anonymous, and studies in other settings have shown the importance of social
comparisons when there is a more targeted group identity (e.g., Frey and Meier 2004; Shang
and Croson 2006, 2009). It is thus compelling to expect that the importance of social com27

parisons is even more pronounced in real-world settings. We expect this is particularly true
for preferences that include relative consumption, as they allow individuals to respond not
only to the donations of others, but to others’level of philanthropy. To the best of knowledge, this e¤ect has been largely ignored both in experimental and …eld work on charitable
giving, and we think it provides an important subject for future research.

Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 1
This appendix provides a formal proof of Theorem 1 in the main text. We prove the result
for an arbitrary agent i, recognizing that the same argument can be extended to all other
agents.
Proof that (1)=)(2): We show that existence of a utility function Ui that rationalizes the data implies a solution to the inequalities. Utility maximization requires that
(xti ; yit ) 2 arg max Ui xi ; ci xi ; xt i ; yi + Y t i ; d yi ; yt i

ptx xti + pty yit :

and

where numerical subscripts indicate partial derivatives with respect to the corresponding
argument, and t is the Lagrangrian multiplier for the budget constraint. If the utility
function is not di¤erentiable, derivatives can be replaced with subderivatives, which will
exist because Ui is concave. Each of the …rst-order conditions will hold with equality if xti
and yit are positive, respectively. We de…ne the following: ti = Ui1t , ti = Ui2t , ti = Ui3t ,
t

. Note that ti ; ti ; ti ; ti 0 and ti > 0. Substituting these parameter
i = Ui4 , and i =

inequality, concavity of Ui implies that for any t and t0 , it must hold that

which completes this direction of the proof.

This function is concave in all arguments because it is the lower envelope of linear functions.
It is standard to show that Ui xti ; ci xti ; xt i ; yit + Y t i ; di yit ; yt i = Uit as follows. By

where the inequality cannot be strict because it would violate the …rst inequality of condition
(2). We observe that since ci and di are concave in the …rst argument, for any (x i ; y i ),
the following inequalities must hold for all (x0i ; yi0 ); (x00i ; yi00 ):
ci (x00i ; x i )

ci (x0i ; x i )

ci1 (x0i ; x i )[x00i

x0i ];

di (yi00 ; y i )

di (yi0 ; y i )

di1 (yi0 ; y i )[yi00

To complete the proof, we must now show that the observed choices of agent i for
t = 1; :::; T maximize the constructed utility function Ui . Consider any bundle (xi ; yi ) such
that ptx xi + pty yi ptx xti + pty yit : It follows by de…nition of Ui and concavity of ci and di that

The second two inequalities of condition (2) imply that either ti + ti cti1 = ti ptx or xti = 0,
and that either ti + ti dti1 = ti pty or yit = 0. Substituting these expressions into the previous
inequality yields

But because a utility of Uit can be achieved by choosing (xti ; yit ), the inequality shows that
(xti ; yit ) is a best response, and this completes the proof.

Appendix B: Instruction Sheet for Cohort-A
Welcome
This is an experiment about decision making. You will be paid for participating, and the amount
of money you will earn depends on the decisions that you make. Your decisions will also a¤ect
the amount of money the experimenters will donate to the Hoosic River Watershed Association
(HooRWA), a local non-pro…t dedicated to the restoration, conservation and enjoyment of the
Hoosic River and its watershed, through education, research, and advocacy. The entire experiment
should be completed within an hour. At the end of the experiment you will be paid privately and
in cash for your decisions. A research foundation has provided the funds for this experiment.
Claim Check
In a few moments, you will choose an envelope. In it, you will …nd a Choice Sheet with a unique
number in the upper-right corner, and your Claim Check, a purple slip of paper with this same
number. Each participant has a di¤erent number. At the end of the experiment, your money will
be in an envelope whose number matches your Claim Check.
Your Identity
We asked for your name when you arrived so we could keep track of who has participated. We will
not ask you again to reveal your identity. Neither the experimenters nor the other participants will
be able to link you to any of your decisions. In order to keep your decisions private, please do not
reveal your choices or claim check number to any other participant.
Your Choices
In this session, each subject has a match. Let us call you Participant B. A subject will be randomly
selected to be your match, Participant C. You will be the match of 1 di¤erent randomly selected
participant, Participant A. You will not know the identity of either of these participants.
You will make a choice in each of 20 scenarios. At the end of the experiment, one of the 20
scenarios for each participant will be randomly selected for payment. The choice that you made
in the selected scenario determines the number of points you and HooRWA earn. Based on which
scenario is chosen, but not the choice you make in that scenario, Subject C (your match) also earns
points. Your total points are the sum of the points you receive in your selected scenario as well as
the points you receive in Subject A’s selected scenario. Every point is worth 10 cents. For example
if you earn 58 points, you earn $5.80. If HooRWA earns 58 points, the experimenter donates $5.80
to HooRWA.
In each scenario, HooRWA and your match each start with a number of points. These points
vary from scenario to scenario. You are given a set of tokens, and you are asked to divide the tokens
between yourself and HooRWA. As you divide the tokens, you and HooRWA each earn additional
points. The number of tokens you have to divide, as well as the number of points you earn for
each token you hold and the number of points HooRWA earns for each token you pass to HooRWA,
varies from scenario to scenario.
To summarize, you choose how to divide tokens in each of 20 scenarios, where each scenario
speci…es:

31

The number of points your match earns if this scenario is chosen for payment.
The number of points HooRWA starts with.
The number of tokens you have to divide between yourself and HooRWA.
The number of points you get for each token you hold.
The number of additional points HooRWA gets for each token you pass to HooRWA.
Example

Your choice
Hold ___@1 point each, and Pass ___@2 points each

In this example, HooRWA starts with 20 points, and your match has 40 points. You must
divide 50 tokens, and your match receives 40 points regardless of how you divide these tokens.
You can keep all the tokens, keep some and pass some to HooRWA, or pass all the tokens. In this
example, you will receive 1 point for every token you hold, and HooRWA will receive an additional
2 points for every token you pass. Remember, each point is worth $0.10. For example:
If you hold 50 tokens and pass 0:

– Your match winds up with 40 points, and earns $4.00 if this scenario is selected for
payment.

– You receive 50 points from 50 tokens at 1 point each, and thus earn $5.00 if this scenario
is selected for payment.

– HooRWA receives no additional points. As HooRWA started with 20 points, it earns
$2.00 if this scenario is selected for payment.
Alternatively, if you hold 0 tokens and pass 50:

– Your match winds up with 40 points, and earns $4.00 if this scenario is selected for
payment.

– You receive no points, and thus earn $0.00 if this scenario is selected for payment.
– HooRWA receives 100 additional points from 50 tokens at 2 points each. As HooRWA
started with 20 points, it now has 120 points and earns $12.00 if this scenario is selected
for payment.
You could, however, choose any number between 0 and 50 to hold. For example, if you hold
29 tokens and pass 21:

– Your match winds up with 40 points, and earns $4.00 if this scenario is selected for
payment.

– You receive 29 points from 29 tokens at 1 point each, and thus earn $2.90 if this scenario
is selected for payment.

32

– HooRWA receives 42 additional points from 21 tokens at 2 points each. As HooRWA
started with 20 points, it now has 62 points and earns $6.20 if this scenario is selected
for payment.
Further Examples
In a few moments, your computer screen will display a couple of further examples. In each case, we
specify a hypothetical distribution of tokens, and ask you to calculate the …nal number of points
and earnings for you, HooRWA, and your match. If you have any questions about the examples or
how to calculate the …nal number of points or earnings, please raise your hand and an experimenter
will assist you. Once everyone has successfully answered all of the questions, we shall …nish the
instructions.
For both these examples and the choices you will make later in the session, please feel free
to use your calculator, or the one provided by the experimenter, to calculate points and to assure
that all of the tokens have been allocated.
How You Will Be Paid
The payment procedure satis…es three goals: 1) Ensure that you get the appropriate earnings; 2)
Ensure that you are con…dent that we follow the promised procedures; and 3) Ensure that it will
never be possible to link your identity to your choices. To satisfy all of these goals, the payment
procedure has a number of steps. I encourage you to ask any questions you have after I describe
the payment procedure.
First, I point out that all participants make decisions for the same 20 scenarios, although
each participant’s Choice Sheet lists them in a di¤erent random order.
After you have made all 20 choices, I am going to ask you to place your Choice Sheet back
in the envelope, making sure you keep your Claim Check. After all participants have done so, I
will pass around a box and ask you to place your envelope in the box. I will then shu- e all of the
envelopes, and ask for one volunteer to monitor the next steps.
The monitor and I will take envelopes to the next room. Based on the order of the shu- ed
forms, we shall use a table of random numbers to select one of each participant’s choices to carry
out. For the scenario chosen for your form, you get your points for the tokens you hold, HooRWA
gets its points (initial points plus points for tokens you pass), and the subject whose Choice Sheet
follows yours in the shu- ed stack gets the points indicated for Match. This means that your total
points for the session will be the sum of your points on the randomly selected scenario chosen for
your Choice Sheet and Match’s points on the randomly selected scenario chosen for the preceding
Choice Sheet. You get 10 cents per point, and we will put your money in an envelope, write your
Claim Check number on it, and seal it. We will also add up all of HooRWA’s points. I will write a
check to HooRWA, place it in a stamped envelope, and give it to the monitor to mail.
The monitor and I will return to this room. I will pass around the stack of envelopes, asking
each participant to take the envelope corresponding to his or her claim check, but not yet open
it. Once every participant has the envelope corresponding to his or her claim check, the session is
over, and you are free to leave and of course, open your envelope.

33

Next Steps
Are there any questions? I will now let you choose an envelope in which you will …nd your Claim
Check and Choice Sheet. Once you have put your Claim Check in a safe place, you may start
making your choices. I ask that for each scenario, you make sure the number of tokens you hold
plus the number you pass adds up to the number you have to divide. After you have made all of
your choices, please put your Choice Sheet back in the envelope. I ask that when you are done you
click the OK button on your computer monitor. This will allow me to know when all participants
have …nished.

Appendix C: Instruction Sheet for Cohort-B
The instruction sheet for Cohort-B was similar to that for Cohort-A . The organization of sections
was identical. Here we include only those sections that di¤ered for Cohort-B.
Your Choices
In this session, you will make a choice in each of 20 scenarios. At the end of the experiment, one
of the 20 scenarios for each participant will be randomly selected for payment. The choice that
you made in the selected scenario determines the number of points you and HooRWA earn. Every
point is worth 10 cents. For example if you earn 58 points, you earn $5.80. If HooRWA earns 58
points, the experimenter donates $5.80 to HooRWA.
In each scenario, HooRWA starts with a number of points, which varies from scenario to
scenario. You are given a set of tokens, and you are asked to divide the tokens between yourself
and HooRWA. As you divide the tokens, you and HooRWA each earn points. The number of tokens
you have to divide, as well as the number of points you earn for each token you hold and the number
of additional points HooRWA earns for each token you pass to HooRWA, varies from scenario to
scenario.
HooRWA’s initial points come from actual choices participants made in a previous session.
These participants had the same number of tokens to divide, faced the same number of points
for each token held and passed, and had 1 of their 20 choices selected for payment for themselves
and HooRWA. For each scenario, we selected one choice from a set of previous choices to match
with each of yours. Your Choice Sheet will explicitly indicate for each scenario how a previous
participant decided to divide his or her tokens in that scenario.
To summarize, you choose how to divide tokens in each of 20 scenarios, where each scenario
speci…es:
The number of tokens you have to divide between yourself and HooRWA.
The number of points you get for each token you hold.
The number of additional points HooRWA gets for each token you pass to HooRWA.
The number of points HooRWA starts with, which is equal to the number of tokens a randomly
selected previous participant chose to pass times the number of points HooRWA gets for each
token.
The number of tokens a randomly selected previous participant chose to hold, and the resulting number of points that subject earned if the scenario was selected for payment.
Please note that while we are using the actual choices of previous participants to determine
the number of points HooRWA starts with in each scenario, we will not use your choices in any
subsequent session.

In this example, HooRWA starts with 20 points, and you must divide 50 tokens which are
worth 1 point each to you and 2 points each to HooRWA. You can keep all the tokens, keep some and
pass some to HooRWA, or pass all the tokens. Remember, each point is worth $0.10. When faced
with this scenario, a subject in a previous session held 40 tokens and passed 10 tokens, resulting
in 40 points ($4.00) for the participant and 20 points ($2.00) for HooRWA. Therefore, HooRWA
starts with 20 points in your scenario. The amount you and HooRWA earn depend on your choice.
For example:
If you hold 50 tokens and pass 0:

– You receive 50 points from 50 tokens at 1 point each, and thus earn $5.00 if this scenario
is selected for payment.

– HooRWA receives no additional points. As HooRWA started with 20 points, it earns
$2.00 if this scenario is selected for payment.
Alternatively, if you hold 0 tokens and pass 50:

– You receive no points, and thus earn $0.00 if this scenario is selected for payment.
– HooRWA receives 100 additional points from 50 tokens at 2 points each. As HooRWA
started with 20 points, it now has 120 points and earns $12.00 if this scenario is selected
for payment.
You could, however, choose any number between 0 and 50 to hold. For example, if you hold
29 tokens and pass 21:

– You receive 29 points from 29 tokens at 1 point each, and thus earn $2.90 if this scenario
is selected for payment.

– HooRWA receives 42 additional points from 21 tokens at 2 points each. As HooRWA
started with 20 points, it now has 62 points and earns $6.20 if this scenario is selected
for payment.

How You Will Be Paid
[Only the third paragraph di¤ered in this section.] The monitor and I will take envelopes to the
next room. Based on the order of the shu- ed forms, we shall use a table of random numbers to
select one of each participant’s choices to carry out. For the scenario chosen for your form, you get
your points for tokens you hold and HooRWA gets its points (initial points plus points for tokens
you pass). You get 10 cents per point plus your $5 participation fee, and we will put your money
in an envelope, write your Claim Check number on it, and seal it. We will also add up all of
HooRWA’s points. I will write a check to HooRWA, place it in a stamped envelope, and give it to
the monitor to mail.
