Ambiguous Pollution Response to COVID-19 in China

NBER Working Paper No. 27086

                                          ABSTRACT

Reductions in ambient pollution have been taken as an indisputable "silver lining" to the
COVID-19 Pandemic. Indeed, worldwide economic contraction induced by COVID-19
lockdowns should generate global air quality improvements ceteris paribus, including to China's
notoriously-poor air quality. We analyze China's official pollution monitor data and account for
the large, recurrent improvement in air quality following Lunar New Year (LNY), which
essentially coincided with lock-downs in 2020. With the important exception of NO2, China's air
quality improvements in 2020 are smaller than we should expect near the pandemic's epicenter:
Hubei province. Compared with LNY improvements experienced in 2018 and 2019 in Hubei, we
see smaller improvements in SO2 while ozone concentrations increased in both relative and
absolute terms (roughly doubling). Similar patterns are found for the six provinces neighboring
Hubei. We conclude that COVID-19 had ambiguous impacts on China's pollution, with evidence
of relative deterioration in air quality near the Pandemic's epicenter.

1      Background
Dramatic improvements in air quality have been attributed to COVID-19. NASA’s
satellite data show that NO2 levels decreased precipitously in China in mid-February
2020 relative to early January (NASA, 2020). Data from US government-maintained
pollution monitors in four Chinese cities show an average daily reduction of 15-17
µg/m3 in PM2.5 across Jan-Feb 2020 relative to the same period in the previous four
years (Burke, 2020). On carbon dioxide emissions, the reduction in coal and crude
oil use in 2020 suggests a reduction in CO2 emissions of 25%, or about 100 million
metric tons, compared to the same period in 2019 (Myllyvirta, 2020). These reduc-
tions have been widely discussed and disseminated in the popular press (Popovich,
2020; McMahon, 2020; Rathi and Hodges, 2020).

   The broader context of these patterns is important to their interpretation. We
highlight three aspects which together paint a more nuanced picture of the likely
response of pollution to COVID-19 in China:
    1. To the extent that air quality had been improving in China over time prior
       to the coronavirus outbreak (Greenstone and Schwarz, 2018), comparisons of
       2020 pollution with previous years can overstate the role of COVID-19 in
       reducing pollution.
    2. The COVID-19 outbreak in China occurred around the same time as Lunar
       New Year. Wuhan’s lockdown began January 23, followed two days later by
       2020’s Lunar New Year (LNY). Lunar New Years have been found to reduce
       sharply pollution in the shorter-term in China and Taiwan (Tan et al., 2009;
       Jiang et al., 2015; Kong et al., 2015). Indeed, the pollution pattern is suffi-
       ciently pronounced that California’s air quality improves around LNY due to
       reduced transboundary pollution from China (Ngo, Zhong, and Bao, 2018).
       Ignoring this recurrent annual drop likewise tends to overstate the pollution
       reduction attributed to COVID-19.
    3. Most NOx pollution tends to be produced by the transport sector, which
       markedly reduced its activity during Chinese lockdowns. In contrast:
       (a) Sulfur Dioxide (SO2 ) tends to be produced by the combustion of fossil
           fuels in power generation and heating furnaces. Thus, it may respond
           differently to the coronavirus outbreak. Like NOx , SO2 impairs human
           health (EPA), labor market outcomes (Hanna and Oliva, 2015), and is
           a “criteria air pollutant” according to the US Environmental Protection
           Agency (EPA), but has been analyzed less in discussions of COVID-19.
       (b) Ozone (O3 ) is not emitted directly, but produced by the combination of
           NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of heat and
           sunlight. Like SO2 , ground-level ozone impairs human health (Neidell,
           2009; Lleras-Muney, 2010; Deschenes et al., 2017) and is a “criteria air
           pollutant” (EPA).
       (c) Carbon Monoxide (CO) is released during combustion. Vehicles and ma-
           chinery that burn fossil fuels release CO, including home heating sources
           and cooking. Like SO2 and ozone, CO is also an EPA“criteria air pol-
           lutant” that can harm health (Currie and Neidell, 2005; Currie et al.,


                                           2
          2009).
     Points 1. and 2. above suggest a “difference in differences” analysis, which is
conventional in economics. In this spirit, satellites also show drops in air pollution
during the Chinese Lunar New Year in previous years, but the drop in NO2 in 2020
is about 10-30% larger than what is observed during the same period in the past
fifteen years over central and eastern China (NASA, 2020).


2     Empirical Specification
Here, we build on the difference-in-differences (DD) thought experiment above
(NASA, 2020) to estimate a regression model that accounts for both: a) annual
differences in air quality and; b) the expected drop in pollution immediately fol-
lowing Lunar New Year. As noted above, failure to account for both can inflate
estimates of the air quality benefits of COVID-19. In addition to the DD, we re-
move average differences across pollution monitors and thereby average pollution
differences across provinces, along with the pronounced pollution differences by day
of the week. Finally, we recast the data in an “event study” analysis which nor-
malizes time around the Lunar New Year event (cf. dropping calendar dates which
have a different position vis à vis Lunar New Year in different years(NASA, 2020)).
We estimate the following regression equation:

      yit = α0 + β1 Postt + β2 Y2020t + β3 Postt ∗ Y2020t + γi + τt + Xit + uit    (1)

where yit denotes pollution measures at monitor i in date t. Our independent vari-
ables include a binary variable P ostt that is 1 after New Year’s day and 0 otherwise,
a binary variable Y 2020t that is 1 for year 2020 and 0 otherwise, and their inter-
action term P ostt ∗ Y 2020t . The coefficient β1 measures the change in pollution
before versus after New Year’s day in year 2018-19. β2 measures the annual change
in average pollution in 2020 versus that in 2018-19. The coefficient of chief interest,
β3 , measures the difference in pollution changes before versus after New Year’s day
between year 2020 and year 2018-19. We also control for τt that includes a year
2018 dummy and day of week fixed effects, γi pollution monitor fixed effects, and
Xit weather controls.

   We present these results separately for Hubei, the province at the center of the
outbreak. We estimate a second set of DD regressions in Hubei’s neighbors (drop-
ping Hubei), and a third for the provinces that do not border Hubei.

    Finally, we compare provinces according to their proximity to Hubei, year, and
Lunar New Year in a triple-difference analysis. We describe further the triple dif-
ference specification and our data sources in the Supplementary Material Section
1.


3     Results
While some of the information reported about COVID-19 may be subject to doubt,
Hubei was clearly the epicenter of COVID-19 in China. Hubei had over 1,000

                                          3
       COVID-19 cases per million, while neighboring provinces had 15 and non-neighbors
       just 8 (Table 1).1,2 Similar differences are seen for COVID-19 mortality rates in
       Table 1. If COVID-19 decreased economic activity and therefore pollution, then we
       would expect larger decreases in pollution in and around the Pandemic’s epicenter.

           NO2 aside, we find China’s largest improvements in air quality did not occur
       in Hubei. Nor did they occur in Hubei’s six neighboring provinces. Instead, the
       24 provinces that do not border Hubei show the largest improvements in air qual-
       ity. Figure 1 plots average SO2 and O3 concentrations before and after the Lu-
       nar New Year in 2020 and 2019 for three different locations: Hubei, neighboring
       provinces, and non-neighboring provinces. For SO2 concentrations, all three lo-
       cations experienced decreases after LNY in 2019. In 2020, however, Hubei and
       neighboring provinces have little reduction in SO2 concentrations after LNY. Only
       in non-neighboring provinces, SO2 concentrations show decreases in 2020. For O3 ,
       the increases in concentrations after LNY in 2020 are more pronounced compared
       to those in 2019, particularly in Hubei. We illustrate the DD model by adding trend
       lines – predicted values from a simplified DD model – to the raw SO2 and O3 data
       in Supplementary Material Figure S1 .3

           Figure 1 also shows higher pre-LNY SO2 concentrations in 2019. This under-
       scores the importance of also accounting for the annual decline in pollution when
       relating pollution changes to COVID-19 in 2020.

           In Table 2, we show results from our difference-in-difference framework described
       in Section 2. In Panel A for all China, negative coefficients on Post for ln(NO2 ),
       ln(SO2 ), ln(PM2.5 ), and ln(CO) reflect decreases after the New Year day in 2018-19.
       The negative estimates of the interaction term Post*Y2020 for ln(NO2 ), ln(PM2.5 ),
       and ln(CO) suggest additional reductions in these three pollution measures in 2020,
       compared to those in 2018-19. For ln(SO2 ), however, the positive estimate of
   1
      We use accumulated cases and deaths on Feb 21 because this is the latest day of our study period,
namely 28 days after LNY in 2020.
    2
      That said, we take the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths with a
large grain of salt: testing is incomplete, endogenous, etc. Aggregating up to broader geographic regions
may reduce measurement error and moreover, Hubei’s status as the provincial epicenter is unambiguous.
    3
      These simplified DD estimates are consistent with our DD estimates that include the full set of control
variables reported in Supplementary Material Table S2. This indicates that our basic results are robust
to and relatively unaffected by: weather controls, day of week fixed effects, a 2018 year dummy, and fixed
effects for each pollution monitor.

      Post*Y2020 suggest a 1% smaller decrease in SO2 concentration in 2020.4 In other
      words, the post-LNY decrease in SO2 in 2020 is about 15%, smaller than the de-
      crease of 16% in 2018-19. For O3 , we find it increases 40% more after LNY in 2020.5
      Thus for China’s air quality as a whole, estimated coefficients for the Post*Y2020
      interaction term suggest a mixed response to COVID-19 that depends on the pol-
      lutant considered.

         In Panel B-D, we compare these estimates in Hubei, neighbors, and non-neighbors.
      Consistent with what we observe in Figure 1, Panel D’s interaction term shows that
      SO2 decreased by 6% post-LNY in non-neighbor provinces. In contrast, Hubei shows
      29% less improvement in SO2 and a modest 12% improvement in PM2.5 . Provinces
      neighboring Hubei also show relatively less improvement in SO2 of 16%. All loca-

tions show increases in O3 , with Hubei the highest at 108%.

   In Table 3, we use a triple-difference design to compare Hubei vs. neighboring
provinces (Panel A) and neighboring provinces vs. non-neighboring provinces (Panel
B). These triple differences using geography are “on top” of the Table 2 differences
by year and Lunar New Year. So, conditional on the time double-differences, was
pollution less improved in Hubei and Hubei’s surrounding provinces? The coefficient
on the Post*Y2020*Hubei dummy for ln(SO2 ) is positive and indicates Hubei had
an unusually small improvement in SO2 following the coronavirus outbreak than its
neighbors. Similarly, PM2.5 , CO, and ozone all show modest relative increases in
Hubei in the triple-difference. The exception again is NO2 , which has a negative
Post*Y2020*Hubei coefficient, though it is the smallest in absolute value and bor-
derline statistically significant.

    Likewise in Panel B of Table 3, the positive coefficient on Post*Y2020*Neighbor
for ln(SO2 ) suggests that Hubei’s neighbors had smaller improvements in SO2 than
non-neighboring provinces. For O3 , we also find larger increases in concentrations
in Hubei’s neighbors than non-neighbors (32%). In contrast, NO2 and PM2.5 show
no relative change in the DDD. Inconsistent with the above patterns, CO fell in
Hubei’s neighbors by about 5%.


4     Discussion
There is tremendous interest in understanding COVID-19’s sweeping impacts. Among
these, air quality impacts have already been assessed, albeit in the popular press.
In the COVID-19 context, it is important to reiterate that air quality is multi-
dimensional. These dimensions seem to have responded quite differently to the
coronavirus outbreak in China. While NO2 fell precipitously in response to coro-
navirus shutdowns, SO2 and ozone did not. For China as whole, PM2.5 fell 22%,
but ozone concentrations increased 40% and sulfur dioxide has little improvement
(relative to 2019 and pre-LNY period). Ozone increases were larger in provinces in
and around COVID-19 epicenter, and similarly SO2 had less improvement.

     Because both SO2 and ground-level ozone compromise health, it is unclear
whether decreases in NO2 were large enough to offset the health damage from in-
creased ozone and relatively smaller improvement in SO2 around the pandemic’s
epicenter. Our DDD estimates furthermore indicate that neither PM2.5 nor CO
fell “enough” in Hubei, given both LNY and secular reductions by year. Insofar as
China and Hubei in particular are concerned, claims to a health benefit of reduced,
unidimensional “pollution” are premature.

   Future research should explore why SO2 improved less and ozone increased in
around Hubei. For the epicenter, why has ground level ozone increased more than
other provinces following COVID-19 outbreak? This is all the more surprising given
the smallest improvement in PM2.5 in Hubei. Unfortunately, the official pollution
monitoring data we analyze here do not permit any emission source attribution. To
the extent that workers who stayed home increased demand for dirtier sources of


                                         6
      residential electricity and heating, esp. that from high-sulfur coal, the increase in
      residential demand could offset the decrease in industrial demand.

          Data from the largest emitting firms with Continuous Emissions Monitoring Sys-
      tems (CEMS) equipment might offer some insight (Karplus, Zhang, and Almond,
      2018). We report CEMS results in Supplementary Material Table S6. Unfortu-
      nately, there is a large increase in the number of Chinese firms with missing CEMS
      data following the COVID-19 outbreak, and VOC concentrations are not reported.
      Focussing on Hubei, the number of reporting firms fell more after LNY compared to
      other provinces. The number of Hubei firms reporting continuously over this period
      is only in the low 20s. Thus evidence from this select subset of firms is all but anec-
      dotal. These caveats aside, it appears that while NOx in these large Hubei firms fell,
      SO2 concentrations did not decrease. In other provinces, we observe decreases in
      both NOx and SO2 concentrations among large firms. If real, this could occur due
      to changes in the scale/intensity of plant operation, fuel input source, reductions
      in scrubber operation when scrutiny slackened (in Hubei), or other factors. Future
      research might investigate the mechanisms for the nuanced response of air quality
      to COVID-19 in China.

          Like China, do other countries show an ambiguous pollution response to COVID-
      19? Presumably, lockdowns have increased demand for residential heating and cook-
      ing sources globally. Slackening in the enforcement of environmental regulation and
      enforcement – even if implicit – may also increase pollution. As a striking case
      in point, the United States announced on March 26 it would not enforce its en-
      vironmental regulations during COVID-19.6 What will the health consequences
      be? In sum, the “silver lining” story that COVID-19 improves air quality appears
      excessively sanguine.
