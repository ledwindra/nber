PUBLIC R&D POUCIES AND COST
BEHAVIOR OF THE US
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES

ABSTRACT
This paper estimates and evaluates the contributions of R&D tax incentives and publicly

financed R&D investment policies in promoting growth of output and privately funded R&D

investment in US manufacturing industries. Publicly financed R&D induces cost savings but

crowds out privately-financed R&D investment while the incremental R&D tax credit and
immediate deductibility provision of R&D expenditures have a significant impact on privately

financed R&D investment. The optimal mix of both instruments is an important element for
sustaining a balanced growth in output and productivity in the manufacturing sector.

Introduction'

An important characteristic of R&D investment which distinguishes it from
other types of investment is that its output has the properties of public
goods: It can be considered at least partially non-excludable and non-

rivalrous (see Arrow (1962), Spence (1984), and Romer (1990)). Indeed, the
empirical literature provides evidence that not only is the rate of return of
privately-funded R&D very high compared to that of investment in physical
capital, but, more importantly, its social rate of return is several times
higher than its private rate of return (see, for instance, Cohen and Levin
(1989), Griliches (1979, 1991), Mohnen (1989, 1990) and Nadiri (1980, 1993))
This suggests that there are substantial externalities associated with R&D

investment,

and therefore privately-financed R&D is suboptimal and may require

the direct or indirect support of government.

Theoretically, there are many different ways to deal with market failure

associated with externalities.2 For instance, externality-generating
activities can be encouraged by providing subsidies, by granting producers
property rights and charging differential prices for their use by others, by
allowing firms to internalize the externality and, finally, by having the

government engage directly in externality-generating activities. Indeed, in
the postwar period, the US government has followed a combination of these
policies: establishment of innovators' property rights through the patent
system, encouragement of firms to form joint R&D ventures, direct investment
of R&D through R&D contracts with companies, universities and other nonprofit
institutions, and lastly, tax incentives for company-financed R&D.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the contributions of tax
incentives and public financing of R&D investment policies in promoting growth

of output and productivity of the US manufacturing industries. First, we

-2-

provide econometric evidence of the effects of R&D tax policies in stimulating

privately-funded R&D.3 We are particularly interested in calculating the
effect of R&D tax credit and of treating R&D expenditures as an operating

expense rather than capital expenditures. To put it differently, we are
interested in measuring how much private R&D investment would have fallen if
the R&D tax credit were abolished and if R&D expenditures were treated as
capital expenditures similar to the expenditures on plant and equipment.
Second, we investigate the existence and extent of the spillover effects of
publicly-funded R&D capital on the cost structure of manufacturing industries
at a disaggregated level.

A number of studies have examined the effect of industry-specific,

publicly-financed R&D granted to firms in specific industries. The empirical
results have been thus far inconclusive.' In contrast, however, we are
interested in evaluating the effects on growth and productivity of publicly
financed R&D performed within the industries (internal R&D) as well as the
effects of publicly financed R&D performed in other industries and non-profit

institutions (external R&D). This type of spillover effect of publiclyfinanced R&D has not, to our knowledge, yet been studied. Finally, we
evaluate these policies by estimating (i) a social benefit-cost ratio of
publicly-financed R&D, and (ii) the additional privately-funded R&D
expenditures generated by the R&D tax policies relative to the foregone
government tax revenues.

To achieve these objectives, we estimate a cost function dual to a
production function where, except for the traditional inputs, the rental price
of company-financed R&D capital, and the capital of publicly-financed R&D

explicitly enter into the cost function. Our results suggest that, on the one
hand, publicly-financed R&D induces cost savings but crowds privately-financed

-3-

R&D investment. On the other hand, the incremental R&D tax credit introduced
in 1981 and the immediate deductibility provision of R&D expenditures,
especially the latter, have a substantial inducement effect on private R&D
expenditures in the manufacturing sector.

The Model and Empirical Implementation
The theoretical basis of our model is the standard neoclassical production
function augmented to include three R&D capital stocks, one financed by the
industry and two publicly financed R&D, one performed within the industry and
the other outside, which may capture potential spillover benefits from

government-financed R&D activities. We assume that firms within an industry
minimize their post-tax long-run cost of production subject to the production
function, and that the two types of publicly-financed R&D are unpaid inputs of

production. The post-tax long-run cost function of an industry at time t

is

given by

(1)

C — C (p, y, C; t),

where p is a vector of the after-tax rental price of inputs, y is the
industry's output, and C is the vector of publicly financed R&D capital
stocks.

To estimate the productive effects of government's R&D tax policy, we need
to know the elasticity of company-financed R&D with respect to its own price,
and the cross-price elasticities of all other inputs with respect to the price
of R&D, as well as the effect of tax incentive on the after-tax rental price

of company-financed R&D. A convenient feature of duality theory is that the
second derivatives of cost function with respect to input prices, i.e., the

Bordered Hessian matrix C —

(82C/8pp),

correspond to the input demand price

-4-

derivatives (see Diewert (1974) or Varian (1984)). The effect of tax
incentives on the input demands can therefore be calculated in a

straightforward manner by estimating a cost function like (1), and by knowing
the effect of tax incentives on the rental price of company-financed R&D.

In addition, the effect of publicly-financed R&D stocks can be estimated
by observing that its derivative of cost, 8C/3C ("

0),

corresponds to the cost

change due to an additional unit of public R&D. If the sign is negative, a
positive externality exists, while a positive sign indicates the existence of

a negative externality. The marginal benefits or marginal willingness to pay
functions for the publicly financed R&D stocks can be defined as

b3 measures the benefit, in terms of cost reduction, gained by an industry
due to an increase of a unit of government-financed R&D capital (see Diewert
(1986)).

We specify a translog cost function, assuming that industry h employs four
private inputs, namely labor, intermediate inputs, physical capital
(structures plus equipment), company-financed R&D capital, and two publicly-

financed R&D capital stocks. The post-tax cost function is given by

The Hessian matrix (a2C/8p8p) should be negative semi-definite in order
for the cost function to be concave in input prices. In addition, for the
cost function to be convex in C, the matrix (32C/3GIGE) should be positive

semi-definite. Note that in order for the technology set to be convex, all of
the above conditions should be satisfied (see Diewert (1986)). Furthermore,
in order for the spillovers to have a meaningful context, the cost function

should be non-increasing in C. Finally, the cost function must be nondecreasing in output, and linear homogeneous in input prices (see Jorgenson

(1986)). The last condition is automatically satisfied, since we have
normalized with the price of intermediate inputs.

The model is applied in a sample of twelve manufacturing industries, plus
three groups of industries which were aggregated because the National Science

Foundation does not provide R&D data individually. The sample covers all
industries of the manufacturing sector, which are reported in table 1. The

estimation period covers the years 1956 to 1988. A detailed description and
construction of the variables of the model are reported In the appendix.5

Assuming that the errors attached to equations (3) and (4) are optimizing
errors, they are jointly normally distributed with zero expected value, and

with a positive definite symmetric covariance matrix. The data on industries
are pooled and the estimation is carried out with the full information maximum
likelihood estimator.

Our estimation results are reported in table 2.6 The individual
parameter estimates have a high t-statistic, and R2 of the estimating

equations are high. The standard errors of the regressions are quite low,
indicating a good fit. The parameters associated with government-financed R&D
capital stocks are statistically significant, which implies that there are

indeed spillovers associated with publicly-funded R&D capital. In addition,

-7-

the coefficients of industry dummy variables (not reported) were also jointly
statistically significant, implying interindustry differences in technology.

A number of hypothesis tests were carried out based on the likelihood
ratio test. These tests are reported in table 3.

First, we tested whether

the production technology across industries is the same or whether industries

have the same technology only for the private inputs. These hypotheses are
rejected as indicated by the chi-square statistics shown in the first and
second rows of table 3.

Second, we tested whether the cost function is

independent of publicly-financed R&D. We reestimated the model by setting all
publicly financed R&D parameters equal to zero, only the "internal public" R&D
parameters equal to zero and finally the "external public" R&D parameters

equal to zero. The log of likelihood function as well the chi-square
statistic of these tests are reported in the third, fourth and fifth rows of

table 3 respectively. These hypotheses were also decisively rejected. We
also tested that industries do not experience exogenous technological shocks.

This hypothesis was also clearly rejected (see table 3, sixth row). Finally,
we parametrize differently our model to test the hypothesis that the marginal

benefits of the two types of public capital are the same. Instead of the two
public capital variables being entered separately in the cost function we

specify one publicly financed R&D variable by in (C +

The Effects of R&D Tax

Policy

on Cost Structure

The federal government, recognizing the

importance of R&D investment for

economic growth and international competitiveness, has historically treated

R&D investment more favorably than other kinds of investments. The federal
government basically uses two kinds of tax policy instruments to stimulate R&D

expenditures. One, in place since 1954, is the immediate deductibility
provision of company—financed R&D expenditures, and the other is the direct
R&D tax credit introduced by the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981.
The ERTA, in addition to the introduction of the Accelerated Recovery System
(ARCS) for investment in plant and equipment, introduced an incremental R&D

tax credit for qualified research expenditures. Firms were eligible to claim
either 25% credit if their R&D expenditures exceeded the average of R&D
spending of the three previous years or half of the credit if they were above

twice the base. This credit was initially intended to expire at the end of
1985, but was renewed at a rate of 20% for two additional years in the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 (TRA).7

In order to see the effect of these two R&D tax
R&D, assume that a firm

incurs

incentives

on the price of

$1 of R&D expenditures in excess of its R&D

expenditures in the past three years. With an incremental tax credit of 25%,
this means that the cost to the firm will be reduced by $1 x .25—$.25.
However, the $1 increase in R&D expenditures decreases the incremental R&D tax
credit for the next three years by $.33 x .25 —

$.083 for each year, since the

credit is based on the average of the R&D expenditures of the three previous

years. Thus with a discount rate of 10% the net tax reduction of a $1
increase in R&D expenditures is $.25 -

(_ $.083

/ (1 +

the actual post-tax cost of the expenditures is $1 -

$.045

.045$, and

$.9S5.

Consider now the effect of the immediate deductibility provision of R&D

expenditures. Suppose that the corporate income tax rate is 46%; then the tax
reduction is $.46, and the after-tax cost of R&D expenditures $1 -

$.46

-9-

$.54. Combining these two incentives, the after-tax cost of $1 of R&D
expenditures is $1 -

$.46

-

$.045— $.495, i.e., about 50% less than its before

tax cost.

In order for the firms to benefit from the tax incentives, they must have
sufficient taxable income. In addition, in the case of incremental R&D tax,
Eisner et. al (1984) have estimated that in 1981 and 1982 about 25% and 35%,
respectively, of the firms in the manufacturing sector did not claim the
incremental R&D tax credit either because they did not increase their R&D
expenditures over the base or they did not have sufficient federal income tax

liabilities. Also note that the incremental character of the credit in some
cases might even make the effective rate negative (see, Eisner et al. (1984)

and Hall (1992)). In the absence of information, we assume that the firms in
our sample of industries have enough tax liabilities, and that the increase of
their R&D expenditures was greater than the base but less than twice the base.

Under the above assumptions, let u be the corporate income tax rate,
the incremental R&D tax credit, and A a parameter taking values of 1 if there
is immediate expensing of R&D expenditures, but values less than 1 otherwise.8
The after-tax cost of R&D expenditures is given by qg (1 - A u, -

1981 to 1988. The average after-tax cost of $1 R&D expenditures for this
period is about $.55, where the contributions of immediate expensing and the
incremental R&D tax credit are about .42 and .038 respectively.
Let the after-tax rental price of R&D capital services (PR) be defined by
the equality between the post-tax cost of acquisition and the present value of
future rentals (see for instance Hall and Jorgenson (1967)), then the post-tax

financed R&D about -1.2, Hall (1992) about -1, while Nadiri and Prucha
(l994b), Bernstein and Nadiri (1989) have

reported a price elasticity of total

R&D (company- plus publicly-financed) of about -0.4 to -0.5. Our estimates

are closer to Hall (1992) and Hines's (1991). The

difference between our

estimates of own price elasticity of company-financed R&D and the estimates of
Bernstein and Nadiri and Nadiri and Prucha

can be explained by the fact that

the elasticities estimated by those authors pertain to total R&D performed by
the industry, ie., company-financed as well as publicly-financed and thus
respond less to price changes.
Another interesting observation that emerges from table 5 is that companyfinanced R&D capital and physical capital are substitutes. In high R&D
intensive industries, however, this relation is rather weak. It also seems
that a change in the price of company-financed R&D affects physical capital
relatively less than a change in the price of physical capital affects

company-financed R&D capital; This has a very important implication for
public policy since the tax policy for structures and equipment will have
significant indirect effects on the R&D investment.

instance, has argued that the Accelerated

Cordes (1984), for

Recovery System, introduced in 1981

for plant and equipment investment, has reduced the relative price of physical

-12-

capital in comparison to that of R&D capital. Thus the introduction of an
incremental R&D tax credit Was necessary to restore to some degree the
incentives for R&D investment.

Finally, while company-financed R&D is a

substitute for labor, it is a complement of intermediate inputs in low R&D
intensive industries, but a weak substitute in high-tech industries, such as
chemical (28), machinery (35), electrical equipment (36), transportation
equipment (37), and scientific instruments (38).

The average elasticities of cost, labor, physical capital, R&D capital and
intermediate inputs with respect to incremental R&D tax credit are reported in

table 6.11 This table has been constructed by

multiplying the input price

elasticities by the percentage change of rental R&D price due to a change in

the incremental R&D tax credit. Similarly, in table 7, we present the average
elasticities of the cost and input demands with respect to the rate of
immediate expensing of R&D expenditures.

Clearly, a change in the rate of

expensing has a much larger effect, by almost ten times, than a change in

incremental R&D tax credit. This is because the immediate deduction of R&D
expenditures constitutes about 90% to 96% of the reduction of the cost of R&D,
while the incremental R&D tax credit constitutes the rest. The effect of the
incremental R&D tax credit is small but

nevertheless significant. Both

effects are relatively larger in the low R&D intensive industries than in
high-tech industries, reflecting the fact that industries with a long
tradition of R&D investment respond less

to the cost changes of R&D investment

This is consistent with the evidence from the tax forms of 1981, 1982 and
1983, (see Cordes (1988, 1989))

incremental R&D tax credit had generated about

- 13-

$2.5 billion dollars (on average) of additional R&D expenditures per year at
the manufacturing sector for the period 1981-1988. This estimate is
consistent with that reported by Baily and Lawrence (1992) and Hall (1992).
If it is adjusted with the eligibility ratio of about .63 (see Eisner et al.
(1984)), the R&D credit has stimulated about $1.6 billion dollars of
additional R&D expenditures per year.12

However, it should be noted that

this estimate might be bias upwards since there is evidence that many firms
redefined activities as R&D, after the introduction of R&D tax credit as noted
by Mansfield (1994).

Suppose now that the government, instead of allowing the immediate
deductibility of R&D investment, allows only the economic depreciation of R&D

expenditures to be deducted from current income. With a discount rate and
depreciation rate of 10% (see footnote 8), this implies that the value of the

parameter A is .5, and will account on average for a roughly 35% decline of
R&D expenditures, or about $16 billion dollars per year for the manufacturing

sector as a whole. Combining this estimate with the additional expenditures
stimulated by the R&D tax credit, government tax incentives would generate
about $18 billion dollars per year of additional R&D expenditures. This
amounts to approximately 40% of the total privately-financed R&D of the entire

manufacturing sector. Moreover, if one takes into account that government
directly finances about 30% of total R&D performed in the manufacturing
sector, the tremendous support of R&D activity by the federal government is
quite clear.

The

Effects of Publicly-Funded R&D on

the Cost Structure

An increase of publicly-funded R&D has a significant effect on the cost of
industries if, as has been discussed, the derivatives of cost function with

-14-

respect to publicly-financed R&D capital stocks are different from zero.
Taking the derivative of cost function with respect to internally and
externally performed publicly financed R&D, the elasticity of cost is given by

The effects of internal and external publicly-financed R&D on the cost and

input demands are reported in table 8. In addition we have calculated the
effect of total publicly financed R&D, assuming that the distribution of
publicly financed R&D investment across industries remains the same.13

Our

results support the hypothesis that there is a positive externality from

Publicly-financed R&D. This finding is in contrast with other studies which
usually report insignificant or weak effects on productivity from

publicly

financed R&D performed within an industry (see for instance Griliches (1980,
1986), and Terleckyj (1974, 1984)). The total effect on cost is significant
in all industries in the manufacturing sector except in primary metals (33).

-15-

A percentage change in publicly financed R&D performed outside of the
has significant and much higher percentage effect on cost than the

industry

publicly

financed R&D carried out internally, with the exception in primary metals
industry (33) where the cost elasticity of external public R&D is

statistically insignificant. However, if we compare the relative marginal
cost reductions (dC'/dG —

Ch/ G)

of internal and external public R&D,

the marginal cost reduction of internal publicly financed R&D is

substantially

higher than the external one. For instance, in chemical industry (28), in
1982, the cost elasticity of internal publicly financed R&D is 37% as large as

the cost elasticity of external publicly financed R&D; But since the external
publicly financed R&D is almost 73 times larger than the internal publicly

financed R&D, the marginal cost reduction of internal publicly financed R&D
is about 27 times larger than the external publicly financed R&D. The same is
true for all the other industries, with the relative internal public R&D

marginal cost reduction being larger than the marginal cost reduction of
external publicly financed R&D from 2 times in electrical equipment (36) and
transportation equipment (37) to 142 times in stone, clay and glass products
(32).

In all industries the labor and intermediate inputs are substitutes with

the internal and external publicly-financed R&D capital. The effect of
internal and external publicly-financed R&D capital on physical capital varies
across industries in terms of the magnitude as well as its direction.
Internal publicly-financed R&D and physical capital are substitutes in all
industries with stronger substitution effect in high-tech industries, like

machinery (35), electrical equipment (36), and scientific instruments (38). On
the other hand physical capital is a weak complement to external publicly
financed R&D in high tech industries or independent in low tech industries.

-16-

Two

hypotheses

have been advanced between the relationship of publicly-

financed and privately-financed R&D performed by the industries. One supports
the idea that new scientific knowledge resulting from government financed R&D
expands firms' basic knowledge and thus induces the firms own R&D (Goldberg

(1979), Jaffe (1989), Levin and Reiss (1984), Levy and Terleckyj (1983), Link
(1982), Nadiri (1980) and Scott (1984)); the other suggests that publicly-

financed and company-financed R&D are substitutes, because either the output
of public R&D activity is internalized by the firms, or the publicly-financed
R&D performed by the firms causes the firms to reach their full R&D

capacity

(Carmichael (1981), Lichcenberg (1984, 1988) and Nadiri (1980)). Our
estimates seem to support the former hypothesis for the internally performed
publicly financed R&D, and the latter hypothesis for the externally performed

publicly financed R&D. Indeed, company financed R&D and "inside" publicly
financed R&D is a complement in low R&D intensive industries and independent

in high R&D intensive industries. On the other hand, company financed R&D and
"outside" publicly financed R&D are substitutes, especially in the low R&D
intensive industries, where the effect is more than one.

Overall, our estimates suggest that the spillover effect of publiclyfinanced R&D reduces the cost to industries and thus enhances their

productivity growth. However, it seems that the overall effect of publiclyfinanced R&D crowds out company-financed R&D in all industries. Indeed, in
low R&D intensive industries the crowding-out effect of publicly-financed R&D
is more than one to one, while in high-tech industries publicly and privately-

financed R&D are weak substitutes, as for instance in machinery (35),
electrical equipment (36), transportation equipment (37) and scientific
instruments (38).

The Effectiveness

of Publicly-Financed R&D

and R&D Tax Policy

The objective of this section is to evaluate the effectiveness of tax
policies and the federal government's R&D expenditures. As far as the
incremental R&D tax credit is concerned, this can be done by measuring the

additional R&D expenditures generated relative to foregone tax revenues. For
publicly-financed R&D, this can be done by comparing the social benefits and
costs of publicly-financed R&D capital.

There is some disagreement among economists about the effectiveness of R&D

tax credit. For instance, Mansfield (1985, 1986) has estimated that the
additional R&D expenditures per dollar cost to the government ranges between

$.3 to $.4. Baily and Lawrence (1992) have estimated it to be about $1 to
$1.4. About the same estimates as Baily's are provided by Hines (1991), while
Hall (1992) estimates that the ratio is about 2. These differences in
estimates are basically due to different price elasticities of R&D employed by

the authors. Noting that the tax incentives are subsidies to production, for
a given output the resulting reduction in industry costs is equal to the loss

of government revenue. Thus, we can calculate the ratio of additional R&D
capital services over the foregone government revenue by

r—

PR X5 / )h iç Ci',

(9)

where the numerator is the sum of additional R&D capital services over all

industries and the denominator is the foregone government revenues. Our
estimate implies an average of additional R&D per dollar of government revenue
lost to be about .95 for the period 1981 to 1988 for all industries in our

sample. Comparing this ratio with the findings reported in the literature as
noted earlier, our estimate is in the middle range. If the upwards bias due
to redefinition of activities as R&D is ignored, it appears that the R&D tax

-18-

credit has had a modest but significant impact in stimulating R&D investment.
Moreover, if one takes into account the induced output effect from increases
of R&D expenditures, as well as the extent to which there are spillovers from
privately-financed R&D (and the empirical literature supports this hypothesis
(see for instance, Nadiri (1991)), and company-financed R&D and R&D spillovers
are complements, then the benefit-cost ratio of incremental R&D tax credit
will be substantially higher.
Turning now to the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of publiclyfinanced R&D, assume that the social planner's objective is to maximize the

producer surpluses generated by publicly-financed R&D. Then the sum of
marginal benefit over industries can correspond to a measure of social

benefit.'4 This measure, however, is crude, since the effects of publiclyfinanced R&D capital on the rest of the economy, as well as the benefits of
the particular projects for which has been financed, are not taken into
account.. Nevertheless, the ratio of benefits to cost of an additional unit of
total publicly-financed R&D is given by

—

h -q

(C'/C0) /

q

(10)

where the numerator of (10) is the sum of marginal benefits of industries from
an additional unit of total publicly-financed R&D capital, and the denominator
the marginal cost of an additional unit of publicly-financed R&D capital taken

to be equal to its acquisition price qc Table 9 shows the marginal benefit
of total publicly financed R&D, C0. For each additional unit of total
publicly-funded R&D, in 1982 industries are willing to pay from 0 in primary

metals (33) to ll in electrical equipment(36). The sum of marginal benefits
is 78 for each additional unit of publicly-funded R&D capital, which implies
that the rate of return of publicly-funded R&D, calculated using equation (10)

-19-

is about .78 in 1982. This suggests that there might be underinvestment of
publicly financed R&D, and that government should increase its investment.
In fact, as Mansfield (1986) has pointed out, some economists have argued
that government should abolish the incremental R&D tax credit because it is
ineffective, and instead increase publicly financed R&D expenditures by the

amount of revenues saved. If this were done, what would be the impact on the
industries' production cost and R&D investment in the manufacturing sector?
As noted earlier, the effect of the two instruments on company-financed R&D

are quite different. The publicly-financed R&D crowds out privately-financed
R&D investment, while the R&D tax credit induces it. In table 10 we report

the results of the following experiment: First, we assume that for the year
1988 the government abolishes the incremental R&D tax credit and also that it
allows only the economic depreciation of R&D expenditures to be deducted from

the current income. Given our estimates of tables 6 and 7, these assumptions
would imply that the additional cost for the industry or the revenues saved by

the government would be about $16.9 billion. Second, we assume that the
government increases the publicly financed R&D by the exact amount of revenues

saved which represents a 3.6% increase of publicly financed R&D. Using the
total cost elasticities of table 8, the cost reduction of all industries due

to a 3.6% increase of publicly financed R&D would be $18.2 billion. Thus the
manufacturing sector would be better off by $1.3 billion in terms of potential

cost reduction. However, the reduction of R&D tax incentives would increase
the rental price of company-financed R&D which would reduce R&D investment by

$16.2 billion. Onto that amount we have to add an additional $0.9 billion of
reduction of company-financed R&D investment due to the crowding out effect of
a 3.6% increase of publicly-financed R&D.

Thus, keeping the government budget constant, an equiproportional change

-20-

of R&D tax incentives and publicly-financed R&D would reduce R&D investment in
all industries of the manufacturing sector, and reduce the after-tax cost of
the whole sector (see table 10). However, the net effect on cost would not be
the same for all industries. Publicly-financed R&D has a distributive effect:
High-tech industries, for instance, machinery (35), electrical equipment (36),
and transportation equipment (37), would be worse off, i.e., their after-tax

costs would have increased. On the other hand, low-tech industries, for
instance, food and kindred products (20) and other manufacturing industries

(42), would be better off. This of course is not surprising since the lowtech industries have very small R&D cost shares, and thus the removal of the
subsidies has relatively smaller effect on their cost.

Conclusion
We have examined the effects of publicly-funded R&D and R&D tax policy on

the cost structure of the manufacturing industries at the two-digit level. It
has been shown that the effects of publicly-financed R&D are overall

significant and vary across industries. We also found that the publicly
financed R&D performed inside a particular industry has a stronger marginal
effect on cost savings compared to that of the publicly financed R&D performed

outside of an industry. Furthermore, the results show that publicly-financed
R&D and company-financed R&D are substitutes in low R&D intensive industries,

while weak substitutes in high R&D intensive industries. Thus, an increase in
publicly-financed R&D capital increases the efficiency, in ternis of unit cost

savings, of the industries of the manufacturing sector, but crowds out

privately-financed R&D investment. On the other hand, our results suggest
that the incremental R&D tax credit is modestly successful in inducing

company-financed R&D. However, if the government had to switch to a regime

-21-

where R&D expenditures were treated like tangible investment, there would be a

substantial reduction in privately-financed R&D investment. It seems that
publicly-financed R&D investment is a more appropriate tool for increasing
efficiency and possibly for stimulating output growth, while the R&D tax
policy is a more appropriate tool for stimulating private sector's R&D

investment. Therefore, both instruments, subsidies and direct financing of
publicly financed R&D expenditures, are important elements for sustaining
output growth and productivity increase in the manufacturing sector.

OUTPUT (7), LABOR

(L),

PHYSICAL CAPITAL (K), AND INTERMEDIATE INPUTS (M):

Data on the quantities and priceindices of output, labor, physical
capital and intermediate inputs were obtained from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) for the manufacturing industries at the two-digit level,

reported in table 1. The sample covers the period from 1956 to 1988. All
price indices have been normalized to be equal to one at 1982 value.
For each industry, the quantity of output is measured as the value of

gross output divided by the output price index. The value of gross output
corresponds to shipments plus the change of inventories, and is inclusive of

any portion which is consumed by the same industry. The output price deflator
index is implicitly defined by a Tornqvist aggregation of four-digit gross
outputs.

The labor input quantity is measured as the cost of labor divided by the

price of labor index. The labor input is measured in terms of man hours,
estimated by the BLS Current Establishment Survey. It corresponds to the sum

of

hours of all persons engaged in production in the industry. The price

deflator of labor is measured implicitly by dividing the labor compensation by
the labor hours.

The price of intermediate inputs is derived by a Tornqvist index of the
price indices of materials, energy, and purchased services, obtained from ELS.
The quantity of intermediate inputs is measured as the total cost of
materials, energy, and purchased services divided by the price index of
intermediate inputs.

All price deflators of the above inputs have been

constructed implicitly by using a Tornqvist index to aggregate the
corresponding quantities .

Since own

R&D is explicitly introduced as an input of production, the

-23-

quantities of labor and intermediate inputs are adjusted for their R&D

components in order to avoid double counting (see Schankerman (1981)). For
labor, the R&D labor cost, i.e., the wages of scientists, engineers, and
supporting personnel, has been subtracted from the total labor cost; for
intermediate inputs, the materials and supplies component of R&D has been

subtracted from the total intermediate input cost. The overhead cost
component of R&D weighted by the cost share of labor and intermediate inputs

has been subtracted from both labor and intermediate inputs. The R&D cost
components have been obtained from Research and Development in Industry

(various issues). Finally, the prices of output, labor and intermediate
inputs are multiplied by one minus the corporate income tax to convert them to

after-tax prices. For the period before 1981, the corporate income tax rate
has been obtained from Auerbach (1983) and Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981); for
the period 1981 to 1985, the rate remains the same at .46, while it was
reduced to .34 in 1986 by the Tax Reform Act (TRA).

The physical capital stock is defined as the sum of structures and
equipment capital stock which have been constructed by the perpetual inventory

method. The deflator of physical capital is derived as a Tornqvist index of
the investment price deflators of structures and equipment.

The rental rate of physical capital is measured as PK —

u a)

q

(r+6K)(l -

(see Bernstein and Nadiri (1987)), where q is the physical capital

deflator, r is the discount rate taken to be the rate on Treasury notes of
ten-year maturity obtained from Citibase, 8K
depreciation rate obtained from 61.5,

is

the physical capital

is the investment tax credit, u, is

the corporate income tax rate, and a is the present value of capital

consumption allowances. The investment tax credit until 1980 is taken from
Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981); 8% is used for 1981, and 7.5% for 1982 to 1985;

-24-

finally,

the rate is zero for 1986 when it was abolished by the TRA. The

present values of capital consumption allowances are constructed as a — p

O £K)/(r + p)

(1. -

(see Bernstein and Nadiri (1987)), where p is the capital

consumption allowance rate obtained by dividing the capital consumption
allowances by the capital stock, and B takes value 0 except for the 1962-1963
period in which firms had to reduce the depreciable base of the assets by half
of the amount of the investment tax credit under the Long Amendment Act.
COMPANY-FINANCED R&D (R) AND PUBLICLY FINANCED R&D (C):
Privately-financed R&D capital is constructed using the perpetual

inventory method with a 10% depreciation rate. A constant depreciation rate
of 10% has been used in many studies of R&D spillovers (see, for instance,

Bernstein and Nadiri (1990) and U.S. Department of Labor (1989)). An estimate
consistent with a 10% depreciation rate for the R&D capital has also been
obtained by Nadiri and Prucha (1994a) in a dynamic production model where the

depreciation rate of R&D capital is endogenously determined. The deflated
company-financed R&D expenditures are accumulated for the period 1956-1988.
The initial privately-financed R&D capital stock is found by dividing the real
R&D expenditures of the year 1957 by the sum

of

the R&D depreciation rate and

the average growth rate of physical capital for the period 1948-1956. The
company-financed R&D expenditures have been obtained from Research and

Development in Industry (various issues). The price deflator of R&D capital
is constructed by linking Mansfield's (1987) constructed deflator series

backward with Schankerman's (1979) constructed R&D deflator series, and
forward with the GNP deflator. Mansfield's R&D deflator series goes from 1969

to 1983. Schankerman's goes from 1957 to 1975. For

the years

prior to 1957

and after 1983, the Schankerman and Mansfield deflators are linked to the CNP

deflator. The after-tax rental rate of R&D capital is defined by the equation

-25-

(5) in the text (see discussion there and table 4).
The total government R&D capital stock, C0, and the publicly financed R&D

performed within an industry 01 are constructed along the same lines as
company-financed R&D capital stock, i.e., by using the perpetual inventory

method with a 10% depreciation rate. Data on total federal government
financed R&D expenditures for the period 1970-1988 were obtained from the

Federal Funds for Research and Development (1992). For the period 1953-1970,
they were obtained from Historical Statistics. Colonial Times to 1970 (1975).

These series consist of the total publicly-financed R&D expenditures performed

by the industries, government agents, and nonprofit institutions. The
implicit price deflator of government purchases of goods and services,

obtained from the Statistical Abstracts of the United States (1990), was used

to deflate the R&D expenditure series. The 1952 benchmark is estimated by
dividing the R&D expenditures by the sum of government R&D depreciation rate
and the growth rate of the government physical capital stock (obtained from

the Bureau of Economic Analysis) prior to the sample period. Similarly, for
each industry we constructed the internally publicly financed R&D capital

stock C, obtaining data on industry publicly financed R&D expenditures from
Research and Development in Industry (various issues). Then the external
publicly financed R&D capital Stock for each industry is defined as GE —

CI.

See, for instance, Arrow (1969), Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980), and Varian

(1984)

Evidence of the effectiveness of R&D tax incentives in encouraging
privately-financed R&D spending is somewhat mixed. Evidence from tax
returns (Cordes (1989, 1988)). from surveys (Mansfield (1985, 1986)), from
comparisons of the user cost (Cordes (1984), Cordes et al. (1987), Fullerton
and Lyon (1983), and Hulten and Robertson (1984)), and from econometric
estimates (Baily et al. (1985), Baily and Lawrence (1992), Hines (1991), and
Hall (1992)) are not unambiguous. See Cordes (1988, 1989) for a review.

Studies conducted at the industry or firm level, which usually estimate
total factor productivity regressions (see Leonard (1971), Terleckyj (1974,
1984), Criliches (1980, 1986), Griliches and Lichtenberg (1984) and
Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989)), have not found any evidence of a significant
productivity effect from government funded R&D. Barteisman (1990) has
provided a mixture of evidence, while Nadiri and Mamuneas (1994) and
Mamuneas (1993)), in a cost function framework, have found significant
effects of total publicly-funded R&D. For a collection of case studies
dealing with the effects of federal government's R&D policy see Nelson
(1982).

Half of the industries in our sample, especially the low tech industries,
perform trivial or zero amounts of publicly-financed R&D. Since the
logarithm of zero is not defined, for the purpose of estimation we redefined
the logarithm of internally performed public R&D as in z — in (1 + G1).
This transformation does not affect the parameter estimates but should be
taken into account when elasticities are calculated.
6

We have imposed constant returns to scale on conventional inputs- -labor,
capital, and intermediate inputs- -while the privately financed R&D capital
is allowed to capture the degree of internal returns to scale in the
industry. This was a necessary restriction, since preliminary estimation of
a more general cost function caused thereturns to scale to be unreasonably
high and unstable. The technological change parameters consistently had the
wrong sign, making it difficult to distinguish shifts of the cost function
Also note that we
due to scale or technological change over time.
initially experimented with a more flexible functional form of cost
function. These attempts were also not fruitful since the second order
conditions were always violated.

The credit has from then renewed at a rate of 20%. See Hall (1992) for a
brief history of the credit rate, qualified expenditure rules and base
levels during the period 1981-91.

8 The parameter A can be considered as the rate with which R&D expenditures
are allowed to be deducted in the current period. To see the significance
of immediate expensing of R&D expenditures compare it with the case in which
the government allows only the economic depreciation of R&D expenditures to
be deducted from current income. The present value of the depreciation
deductions of $1 of R&D with a depreciation and discount rate of 10% is
equal to .50 (— .l0/(.l0+.lO)) and the parameter A takes the value .50.
For 1981 &' — (I- .5/(l+r)-_2 .33/(l+r)) since for 1982 the base was the
average of R&D expenditures of 1980 and 1981 (see Eisner et al. (1984)).

10 However, the hypothesis that the mean elasticities are equal across
industries has been tested and rejected.
11 The elasticity of Cost with respect of Tax incentives is given by

(3lnp/8lnT)

12 Cordes (1989) has estimated that the credit stimulated about $560
million to $1.5 billion, while Hall (1992) has estimated that the additional
spending stimulated is about $2 billion 1982 dollars per year.

efficiency when collective goods are used as inputs in the production
process. Sandmo (1972) explored the general equilibrium implications of
these conditions.
