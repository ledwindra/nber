    "abstract": "\n\nExisting evidence shows convincingly that expected cash flows of non-financial firms can be negatively affected by their total risk, so that non-financial firms can create shareholder wealth by managing their total risk. After reviewing theories that demonstrate links between firm value and total risk, I examine how financial risk management is used to manage firm total risk. I conclude from the evidence that the use of financial risk management is mostly limited to near-term risk in non-financial firms. I offer explanations for this limited role of financial risk management. I argue that the limitations of financial risk management make it important for firms to also focus on resilience and call for more research on the costs and benefits of resilience.\n\n",
