    "abstract": "\n\nWe investigate how a combination of limited liability and preexisting debt distort firms\u2019 investment and equity payout decisions. We show that equity holders have incentives to \u201cdouble-sell\u201d cash flows in default, leading to overinvestment, provided that the firm has preexisting debt and the ability to issue new claims to the bankruptcy value of the firm. In a repeated version of the model, we show that the inability to commit to not double-sell cash flows leads to heterogeneous investment distortions, where high leverage firms tend to overinvest but low leverage firms tend to underinvest. Permitting equity payouts financed by new debt mitigates overinvestment for high leverage firms, but raises bankruptcy rates and exacerbates low leverage firms\u2019 tendency to underinvest\u2014as the anticipation of equity payouts from future debt raises their cost of debt issuance. Finally, we provide empirical evidence consistent with the model.\n\n",
