In other countries the stabilization accomplishments remain tentative and vulnerable. And even those countries that have established firmly a new path for their economic management are still waiting for economic growth to return. The hardest part of stabilization is the transition to growth. Even with major adjustment efforts in place, growth does not resume spontaneously. If the lack of recovery is due to a coordination failure than market forces cannot resolve the difficulty, a mechanism must be found to bring about the coordination.\n\n",
