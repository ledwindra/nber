    "abstract": "\n\nWe assess the causal impact of epidemic-induced lockdowns on health and macroeconomic outcomes and measure the trade-o\ufb00 between containing the spread of an epidemic and economic activity. To do so, we estimate an epidemiological model with time-varying parameters and use its output as information for estimating SVARs and LPs that quantify the causal e\ufb00ects of nonpharmaceutical policy interventions. We apply our approach to Belgian data for the COVID-19 epidemic during 2020. We \ufb01nd that additional government-mandated mobility curtailments would have reduced deaths at a very small cost in terms of GDP.\n\n",

Some of the ideas in this paper came out of previous work with Chad Jones. John Cochrane was the \ufb01rst to point out to us the potential key importance of time-varying parameters in epidemiological models.
