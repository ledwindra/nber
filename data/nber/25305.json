    "abstract": "\n\nA potential contributor to socioeconomic disparities in academic performance is the difference in the level of stress experienced by students outside of school. Chronic stress \u2013 due to neighborhood violence, poverty, or family instability \u2013 can affect how individuals\u2019 bodies respond to stressors in general, including the stress of standardized testing. This, in turn, can affect whether performance on standardized tests is a valid measure of students\u2019 actual ability. We collect data on students\u2019 stress responses using cortisol samples provided by low-income students in New Orleans. We measure how their cortisol patterns change during high-stakes testing weeks relative to baseline weeks. We find that high-stakes testing does affect cortisol responses, and those responses have consequences for test performance. Those who responded most strongly \u2013 with either a large increase or large decrease in cortisol \u2013  scored 0.40 standard deviations lower than expected on the on the high-stakes exam.\n\n",
