    "abstract": "\n\nIntense US-China commercial rivalry is quantified in this paper with novel non-parametric relative resistance sufficient statistics. The accounting method minimizes the demand specification error variance in revealed resistances. China's  manufacturing seller incidence falls (seller price rises) 7.6% yearly  as China's sales share quadruples over 2000-14. US  seller incidence rises 4.1% yearly  as US sales share halves. Domestic trade shares closely fit revealed relative resistances with trade elasticity equal to one. Industrial policy pays for itself in suggestive projections. A 10% rise in US 2014 sales share reduces seller incidence 6.0%, exports rise and net benefit is positive.\n\n",
