COVID-19 Doesn't Need Lockdowns to Destroy Jobs: The Effect of Local Outbreaks in Korea
Sangmin Aum, Sang Yoon (Tim) Lee, and Yongseok Shin
NBER Working Paper No. 27264
May 2020
JEL No. I14,I18,J21
ABSTRACT
Unlike most countries, Korea did not implement a lockdown in its battle against COVID-19,
instead successfully relying on testing and contact tracing. Only one region, Daegu-Gyeongbuk
(DG), had a significant number of infections, traced to a religious sect. This allows us to estimate
the causal effect of the outbreak on the labor market using difference-in-differences. We find that
a one per thousand increase in infections causes a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment. Noncausal estimates of this coefficient from the US and UK, which implemented large-scale
lockdowns, range from 5 to 6 percent, suggesting that at most half of the job losses in the US and
UK can be attributed to lockdowns. We also find that employment losses caused by local
outbreaks in the absence of lockdowns are (i) mainly due to reduced hiring by small
establishments, (ii) concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and
transportation industries, and (iii) worst for the economically vulnerable workers who are less
educated, young, in low-wage occupations, and on temporary contracts, even controlling for
industry effects. All these patterns are similar to what we observe in the US and UK: The unequal
effects of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns. Our finding suggests that the
lifting of lockdowns in the US and UK may lead to only modest recoveries in employment unless
COVID-19 infection rates fall.

We isolate the economic effect of COVID-19 that operates through the fear
of infection: The fact that people hunker down and curtail economic activity in
response to local outbreaks. Our estimate is not contaminated by the concomitant effect of government-mandated lockdowns or supply and demand shortages
from outside the economy (such as inter-regional and international trade) due to
the epidemic. We estimate the effect on overall employment, hires and separations, and also examine how the effect is distributed across industries and across
workers of different occupation, education, age, gender and employment type.
Our estimation exploits exogenous regional variation in the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea, as well as the absence of mandatory lockdowns or other socialdistancing measures imposed by the government.1 South Korea had only 30
confirmed infections prior to February 18, 2020, when “Patient 31” attended a
religious gathering of the “Shincheonji” sect in Daegu, a metropolitan city in
the Gyeongbuk province. By February 29, the number of cases in Korea had
exploded to 3,150, with 2,724 cases (or 86.4 percent) in the Daegu-Gyeongbuk
region (DG hereafter) alone. Of these, more than 60 percent were traced to
Shincheonji. Figure 1 shows the cumulative COVID-19 infections per thousand
on February 28 and March 15. It is not the case that DG was more susceptible
to the Shincheonji sect, which has members and churches spread all over Korea.
Thus, the regional variation in infections is uncorrelated with any underlying
socioeconomic factor and provides grounds for a natural experiment.2
Moreover, the Korean government chose intensive testing and contact tracing
as their tool for containing the epidemic rather than enhanced social distancing,
and never mandated a lockdown. This resulted in two additional advantages
of our estimation strategy: (i) The economic reactions were not prescribed by
the government’s promulgation of what are essential or non-essential economic
activities, unlike in the vast majority of countries, and (ii) As of May 20, the
success of its containment strategy resulted in a very low cumulative infection
rate of 0.06 per thousand in Korea, excluding DG, ensuring that the direct effect
1

Another celebrated example of a country not implementing a lockdown is Sweden, and researchers have
tried to infer the economic effect of lockdowns by comparing Sweden with other countries (Andersen et al.,
2020; Born et al., 2020). By design, such studies cannot recover the direct, causal effect of the pandemic
and at best, can only estimate the effect of a lockdown. But even the lockdown effects are still subject to
omitted variable bias and endogeneity—lockdowns are a choice variable for the government, not an exogenous
variation across countries. In addition, Sweden has a much higher cumulative infection rate (3.2 per thousand
as of May 20) than some of the comparison countries (e.g., Denmark, 1.9 per thousand), rendering a simple
comparison of economic outcomes less informative.

The DG region comprises about 10 percent of South Korea’s total population of 52 million and about 9
percent of national GDP.

is entirely confined to DG, with a rate of 1.6 per thousand.
We exploit this setting using difference-in-differences (DiD) on data from an
establishment survey and a separate household survey. The scheme captures
the causal effect of the outbreak on local employment relative to the rest of
the country. The establishment survey further allows a breakdown by industry
and by establishment size. The household survey further allows a breakdown by
occupation, education, age, gender and employment type.
Results Our causal estimate implies that a one per thousand increase in infections leads to a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment in the absence of
lockdowns. In comparison, non-causal estimates of this coefficient for the United
States or United Kingdom, which implemented large-scale lockdowns, range from
5 to 6 percent, suggesting that about half of their job losses may be due to voluntary reductions in economic activity by private businesses and consumers, rather
than a consequence of government-mandated lockdowns. Alternatively, at most
half the job losses in the US and UK can be attributed to lockdowns.
Employment losses caused by local outbreaks stem mostly from reduced hir3

ing by businesses and are mirrored by a rise in labor market non-participation
rather than unemployment. By industry, losses are concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, similar to
(non-causal) patterns observed in the US and UK.
The causal effects of the COVID-19 shock without lockdowns are very unequally distributed: More or less all employment losses were accounted for by
small establishments (fewer than 30 employees), while large establishments actually grew. Less-educated workers, the young, workers in low-wage occupations
and on temporary contracts, and the self-employed lost the most jobs to the
COVID-19 shock, even controlling for industry effects. In a nutshell, the most
economically vulnerable groups even before the shock experienced the most dire
effects. By gender, although the COVID-19 shock hit industries in which women
are over-represented harder, the within-industry effect was positive for women
while negative for men. Consequently, the total causal effect destroyed more jobs
for men than for women.3 All these patterns of causal effects except the effects
by gender are similar to what we observed in the US and UK: The unequal effects
of COVID-19 are the same with or without lockdowns.
Our finding that lockdowns account for at most half the job losses in the US
and UK suggests that the lifting of lockdowns may lead to only modest recoveries
in employment absent larger reductions in COVID-19 infection rates.
Of course, this is not to say that lockdowns are the best policy response. They
are a very blunt tool and may cause more economic damage than necessary. Using
a more theoretical approach, Aum et al. (2020) shows that targeted approaches
can more effectively contain the epidemic at a lower economic cost.

Data

We use three data sets. The first is the Labor Force Survey at Establishments
(LFSE), a monthly survey of 40,000 sampled employers (out of 4.1 million in
2018) by the Ministry of Employment and Labor. It reports the number of
employees and vacancies as of the last business day of the month, as well as
the number of new hires and separations for the month. The second is the
Economically Active Population Survey (EAPS), a monthly survey of 35,000
households collected around the 15th of each month by Statistics Korea, which

Nationwide, the drop in women’s employment was larger than men’s in Korea as well, even in the absence
of a lockdown.

includes worker characteristics (education, age, gender) and jobs (occupation and
employment type).4 The last is the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over
time published by the Korea Centers for Disease Control (KCDC).

advisory campaign. The government also mandated schools and universities to delay the beginning of
the academic year on March 2, 2020.

Methodology and Estimation Results

The DiD scheme we use requires treatment to be exogenous to outcomes, and
a parallel trends assumption to hold between comparison groups pre-treatment.
In our case, the treatment is DG having experienced a major outbreak, which
was traced to local Shincheonji gatherings. Shincheonji is a popular yet secretive
religious sect, but from what we know, has more than 200,000 members spread
out across Korea regardless of each region’s economic standing. If anything, the
DG region has less followers per capita than other regions. Thus, the epidemic
variation can be considered exogenous.
Economically, DG’s share of national GDP and employment has been stable
for at least the last three years, as well as its share of international trade. In any

summary tables by province.

case, Korean exports and imports were in fact higher in February to March 2020
than the monthly average throughout 2019, so it is unlikely that our results are
driven by international factors, especially the contraction of the Chinese economy.
Moreover, to alleviate concerns that differences in industrial or demographic
composition across regions may introduce nonparallel pre-trends, and also to
disaggregate COVID-19’s causal effects, our cross-regional analysis is performed
not only on the entire sample for each of our data sources, but also by industry
and by demographic group.
We present three sets of estimates using DiD, using LFSE data as of February
28 and March 31, and EAPS data as of March 15. Since the Korean government
closed schools on March 2 and commenced social distancing campaigns on March
22, later estimates may be biased; that is, both labor market outcomes and the
spread of the epidemic are endogenous to government policy. Nonetheless, at
no point did the government suggest the possibility of a lockdown, so all our
estimates are free of potentially large-scale disruptions.

2.1

Establishment-side employment data (LFSE)

We first focus on the LFSE data as of February 28, nine days after the Shincheonji
outbreak. At this point, the Korean government is yet to implement any social
distancing measures, instead relying exclusively on contact tracing, testing, and
quarantine of the confirmed infected. Given the exogenous regional variation in
confirmed infections and the timing of the survey, we estimate the causal effect
of the outbreak on the labor market using the following DiD specification:
i
yr,t
= β0i + β1i · Dr (DG) + β2i · Dt (Feb) + γ i · Dr (DG) · Dt (Feb) + εir,t ,

(1)

i
where yr,t
is the variable of interest for industry i, region r at month t, Dr (DG)

is a dummy variable that equals 1 if r =DG and 0 otherwise, and Dt (Feb) equals
1 if t is February 2020 or later months, and 0 otherwise. The primary coefficient
of interest is the DiD term γ i , designed to capture the effect on the DG region,
which was the lone hot spot. In some cases, we will compare γ i with β2i , the effect
of the epidemic on the country as a whole, which we cannot interpret as causal
but is still informative as it is uncontaminated by government-led lockdowns.
We report estimation results for employment growth from January to February and from January to March in Table 1. We estimate the regression coefficients
for the whole sample and also separately for the 18 different industries that span

our data. The industry composition varies across regions and may introduce heterogeneous pre-trends, but the industry-by-industry estimation alleviates such
concerns.
The first row shows the effect of the incipient COVID-19 epidemic on overall employment. Between the end of January and the end of February (from 11
confirmed cases to 3,150 nationwide), employment fell by 0.89 percent (not annualized) in Korea, shown by the estimate of β2 . To put this number in perspective,
employment grew by an average of 0.23 percent per month (not annualized) from
Jan 2018 to Jan 2020, and there is only negligible seasonality. Although causality
cannot be established, it strongly suggests the effect of the incipient epidemic on
the entire Korean economy. The effect was much stronger for DG, which accounted for 86.5 percent of the 3,150 total confirmed cases (there were no case
in DG as of January 31). The estimated γ shows that employment in DG fell at
more than double the rate for the entire country, by 1.91 (0.89 plus 1.02) percent

7

in a month.5 The estimate of γ is the direct causal effect of the local epidemic
on local employment, given the exogenous nature of the variation in confirmed
infections by region.
Table 1 shows that the effects differ across industries, sorted in ascending
order of average wage. Not surprisingly, accommodations/food service industries
were hit hardest, not only nationwide (-5.7 percent), but especially in DG (-15.2
percent), as people avoided contact-intensive services. They also happen to be
the lowest-paying industry. Employment in education industries, which does not
include public school teachers, also saw a large drop (2.4 percent nationwide
and 5.7 percent in DG). Employment in arts/sports/recreation fell substantially
nationwide (2 percent) but there was no additional effect from local infections.
On the other hand, real estate shows a significant negative causal effect, although
its employment went up weakly nationwide.
The right panel of Table 1 shows the cumulative employment effect from the
end of January to the end of March (9,569 cases nationwide, 83.4 percent in DG)
from a regression of bimonthly data. Employment fell by 2.1 percent nationwide over two months (not annualized) and by 3.3 percent in DG. The Korean
government delayed the start of the school year on March 2 and implemented
enhanced social distancing measures on March 22, both at the national level. As
a result, the estimated β2 partly reflects the effect of government policies and
the γ estimate is likely biased downward. The estimates of the causal effect of
the local outbreak γ are similar to those in the left panel, with accommodation/food services showing the largest additional employment decrease in DG.
Wholesale/retail, health/social services, transportation/storage industries show
a significant additional drop in DG in March (1.8, 3.4 and 3.2 percent, respectively), much more so than in February, suggesting a delayed impact. On the
other hand, the differential effect on education industries in DG disappear in
March, which is not surprising given the nationwide delay of the school year.
To unpack the decline in employment, we estimate equation (1) with three
alternative dependent variables: the monthly number of hires, separations and
vacancies, all as a percentage of the previous month’s employment. Table 2 shows
that the February employment drop in DG caused by the outbreak is entirely
driven by decreased hiring and not by increased separations (layoffs and quits).
5
Regional LFSE data are available only from January 2018, implying that γ compares 25 monthly observations with one (January 2018 to January 2020 vs. February 2020). This is a small sample, especially post
COVID-19, but most of our estimates are still highly significant.

The top row of Table 3 shows that the causal effect of the local outbreak
disproportionately affected small establishments (fewer than 30 employees) while
if anything large establishments (300 or more employees) increased employment
(first row) between January and February in DG. This result is partly driven by
industrial composition: Most establishments in accommodation/food services,
the industry hardest hit, are small. However, even within industries, small
establishments lost employment by more than large establishments, especially
in accommodation/food services and education, the two industries showing the
largest causal impact in Table 1. In fact, in transportation/storage and information/communication industries, large establishments increased employment significantly in response to the local outbreak. The lone exception is the real estate
industry, where the negative effect was concentrated among large establishments.

2.2

Household survey data (EAPS)

We now turn to our estimates from EAPS, the household survey that provides
more worker-side information. We still use the estimation equation (1), but now
i indexes a demographic group and the time dummy is Dt (Mar), because the
first post-Shincheonji survey was as of March 15. This is one week before the
launching of the social distancing advisory campaign, but after the decision to
delay the beginning of the school year on March 2.
Table 4 shows that employment fell by 0.6 percent nationwide and by 3.2
(0.64 plus 2.53) percent in DG between February 15 and March 15 (not annualized). These numbers are not directly comparable to the February LFSE
estimates (0.89 and 1.91), because of the newly confirmed infections between
February 28 (the LFSE survey date) and March 15, and also because EAPS includes the self-employed, not included in the LFSE.6 One noteworthy result is
that the fall in employment did not manifest as a rise in unemployment, either
nationwide or in DG. People who left employment instead reported themselves
as non-participants. One possible explanation is that they are waiting out the
epidemic rather than searching for jobs in the midst of it. Alternatively, they
may be expecting to return to their previous job and are thus not searching for
jobs, such as if they were furloughed.7
Table 5 shows the nationwide change in employment, β2 , and the causal
effect of DG’s outbreak on local employment, γ, by occupation, educational
attainment, gender, age and employment type. We focus on the causal effect
of local outbreaks, γ. The first panel, which stratifies the labor force by one-digit

establishment survey of employers.

occupations, shows that service, sales, and craft workers were hit the hardest by
the outbreak in DG. In contrast, the number of managers actually increased by
more than 7 percent. The next two panels show that by education, less educated
workers lost disproportionately more jobs, while by gender, the direct causal effect
was larger for men (-2.8 vs. -2.2 percent).8 By age, the causal effect is largest for
younger workers (those in their twenties or younger), followed distantly by those
in their forties and those aged 60 or older. Finally, by employment type, job
losses were heavily concentrated among temporary workers and unpaid family
workers, although self-employment also fell by 2.3 percent. The overall pattern
that emerges from Table 5 is that workers of lower socioeconomic status were
much more vulnerable to the local outbreak.
But are the unequal employment effects across different worker groups driven
by industrial composition? That is, do the effects differ solely because certain
types of workers are over-represented in industries more exposed to the COVID19 shock? We answer this question by decomposing the causal employment effect
of a given demographic group, γ, into an industry component (that differs only
between industries) and a group-specific component (that varies within industries). A potential problem is that the EAPS only provides data by industry or
by region, but not by industry-and-region. We sidestep this issue by computing
what the effect on each group’s employment would have been if a shock to an
industry in DG, estimated off LFSE in Table 1, equally affected all demographic
groups within it, which is the industry-specific effect.9 Then for each demographic
group, the between-industry effect is computed as the average of industry-specific
effects using as weights each group’s nationwide employment share by industry in
February, only available from EAPS, times employment share by industry for all
workers in DG in January, only available from LFSE. The difference between the
actual effect in Table 5 and this between-industry effect is the within-industry
or group-specific effect.10 Figure 3 shows the total effect and the within-industry
effect on the employment of worker groups. We focus on the causal effect of local
outbreaks γ on the right panel.
By occupation, the positive employment effect on managers is entirely an
occupation-specific phenomenon—if anything, the hardest hit industries had
8

But nationwide, the drop in women’s employment was larger (-1.4 vs. -0.1 percent).
As discussed earlier, the magnitude of γ for all workers is larger in EAPS than in LFSE. Thus we also
rescale LFSE’s industry-specific γ i ’s by the ratio between the EAPS and LFSE estimates for all workers.
10
We do a similar exercise for the nationwide estimate β2 as well, for which we encounter no such data
problem since EAPS reports employment of each demographic group by industry.

more managers than other industries (i.e., a negative between-industry effect on
manager employment). Similarly, the industry effect alone would have cut service worker employment by more than 10 percent, but it was partly offset by a
positive occupation-specific effect on service workers. Sales workers, on the other
hand, were negatively affected by both the industry effect and the occupationspecific effect. That is, industries with larger drops in employment had relatively
more sales workers, and at the same time, the local outbreak disproportionately
destroyed more sales jobs, even within industries.
By gender, comparing the light bars, we see that industries that were negatively hit had a larger presence of women than men. However, the within-industry
effect is actually positive for women while negative for men, leading to our earlier
observation that the causal effect of the outbreak destroyed men’s jobs more than
women’s.
Next, the figure shows that younger workers were not only more likely to work
in industries that experienced larger employment losses, but also more exposed
to the COVID-19 shock regardless of the industry in which they worked. For
those 60 or older, the causal effect on their employment turns out to be almost
entirely accounted for by the between-industry effect.
Finally, the large drop in the employment of temporary workers and unpaid
family workers caused by the local outbreaks are nearly evenly divided into the
between- and the within-industry effects. Not only did such workers tend to be
employed in vulnerable industries, but they also faced similar disadvantages even
within a given industry.
In summary, this decomposition exercise shows that the large employment
losses experienced by the less educated, young workers and temporary workers were not only caused by their larger presence in industries hit harder by
the COVID-19 shock. In addition, while women were over-represented in more
vulnerable industries, the within-industry effect was such that men were more
exposed to a causal drop in employment from local outbreaks.

3.1

Fear of COVID-19 vs. Lockdowns
Impact on total employment

Our estimate of the causal effect parameter γ allows us to calculate how many
jobs are destroyed solely due to private responses to incremental COVID-19
infections in the absence of mandatory lockdowns. The cleanest estimate of
14

γ is -1.02, reported in Table 1 from the February LFSE, the establishment-side
survey. Cumulative infection rates through February 28 were 0.39 per thousand
in DG and less than 0.01 per thousand nationwide, excluding DG. Linearly
extrapolating from our γ estimate, we find that a one per thousand increase in
infections causes a 2.68 percent drop in employment.11 Using our estimate from
the March EAPS, the household survey, we find that a one per thousand increase
in infections causes a 1.85 percent drop in employment.12 This is somewhat
smaller than the calculation based on the February LFSE, possibly because the
nationwide delay of the school year on March 2 biases the estimated causal effect
downward.
These numbers based on our causal estimate, free of any contamination from
mandatory lockdown effects, can be compared to observed labor market outcomes in the United States and the United Kingdom. Relative to Korea, both
countries experienced very high infection counts with country-wide outbreaks,
and implemented large-scale lockdowns in response.13 Since both countries implemented lockdowns almost at the same time as confirmed cases began to spiral
upward, it is not possible to estimate a causal effect such as our γ. So we instead
compute their counterparts to the overall effect β2 . In the US, Cajner et al.
(2020) report a 14-percent decline in active employment between February 15
and April 18, 2020, using ADP payroll data. The cumulative infection count for
the US on April 18 was 738,913, or 2.3 per thousand, implying that a one per
thousand increase in infection counts is associated with a 6.2-percent decline in
employment, a little more than double our causal estimate from Korea. Another
estimate of employment losses in the US comes from Tedeschi and Bui (2020),
who report a 12-percent employment decline between March 1 and April 18 from
Civis Analytics. This implies that a one per thousand increase in infection counts
is associated with a 5.3-percent decline in employment, a number between our
causal estimate and the one implied from the ADP data. For the UK, Gardiner
11

The cumulative infection rates through March 31 were 1.56 per thousand in DG and 0.034 per thousand
nationwide, excluding DG. Linearly extrapolating from the γ estimate, a one per thousand increase in
infections causes a 0.8 percent drop in employment. The March 31 effect is smaller than February 28’s
partly because the nationwide policies in March attenuated the causal effect of local outbreaks.
12
Cumulative infection rates through March 15 were 1.4 per thousand in DG and 0.02 per thousand
nationwide, excluding DG.
13
In the US, lockdown decisions were made by local governments. Forty-two states issued stay-at-home
orders of varying degrees of intensity. Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma,
Utah, and Wyoming never issued state-wide orders, but some of their cities still implemented localized
lockdowns. The UK mandated a nation-wide lockdown, but each country had some discretion on when to
ease restrictions.

15

and Slaughter (2020) estimate that employment fell by 19 percent (15 percent
furloughed plus 4 percent unemployed) based on data collected between May 6
to 11. The cumulative infection count on May 10 was 3.2 per thousand, implying that a one per thousand increase in infection counts is associated with a
5.9-percent decline in employment.
The three calculations from the US and the UK yield three estimates that
are strikingly close to one another, and they are roughly double the relationship
between employment and infection counts implied by our causal estimate without lockdowns. Thus, our results show that even without lockdowns, infection
counts alone would have caused employment losses half as large. Furthermore,
lockdowns are implemented to contain the epidemic. Suppose that infection
counts would have reached twice the levels we observed in those countries had
they not implemented any lockdown.14 Then our causal estimate implies that
the resulting employment losses in the absence of lockdowns would have been
even larger than currently observed employment losses in the US and the UK.

3.2

Impact across industries and demographic groups

Government implementation of lockdowns specify which activities are essential
and non-essential. As a result, any negative employment effects from a lockdown
would be heterogeneous across industries by design, and to the extent that the
demographic composition of workers differ across industries, the effects would
also be heterogeneous across demographic groups.
We compare the pattern of the causal employment effects from local outbreaks without lockdowns (Tables 1, 3, 5 and Figure 3) with national patterns
with lockdowns in the US reported by Cajner et al. (2020). First, with or without lockdowns, nearly the same set of industries are hit hardest by the epidemic,
including accommodation/food services, real estate, transportation/storage and
education. One exception is arts/sports/recreation, which fell significantly nationwide in both Korea and the US, but the causal effect (estimated from regional
differences) is insignificant. Second, in both cases, small establishments are hit
hardest, controlling for industry effects. Third, nearly the same sets of workers are disproportionately affected with or without lockdowns: low-skill workers,
young workers, and those on temporary contracts.15 Finally, in both cases, the
14

By all accounts, this is a lower-bound of counterfactual infection counts had no control measures been
put in place in those countries, e.g. https://covid19.healthdata.org.
15
Coibion et al. (2020) also report this last fact for the US, and the UK data also shows the same pattern

16

heterogeneous effects across workers are accounted for by both between-industry
effects and within-industry effects. One difference is the effect by gender. As
shown in Figure 3, the between-industry causal effect is larger for women, but
the within-industry effect is larger for men so that male workers lose more jobs.
In the US, largely due to the between-industry effect, female employment falls
by more, as well in the UK.16

Concluding Remarks

We estimate the causal effect of COVID-19 infections on the labor market, exploiting regional variations in Korea. Our difference-in-differences estimate is
uncontaminated by lockdowns, which were never pursued by the Korean government, capturing only the voluntary response by private businesses and consumers. Moreover, thanks to a successful test/trace/tracking strategy, total infection counts remained low in Korea and the epidemic was by and large contained
to a single region, DG, which experienced a local outbreak triggered by reasons
exogenous to any underlying economic factor.
Our main result that a one per thousand increase in confirmed infections
causes a 2.7-percent decline in employment is about half the magnitude of noncausal estimates from the US or UK, which confound the direct effects from
COVID-19 with lockdown effects. Moreover, the causal patterns we obtain across
industries, establishment size classes, and workers’ occupation, education, age
and employment type tell us that the epidemic struck high-contact industries,
small establishments, and workers of lower socioeconomic status the hardest. The
causal patterns are very much in line with descriptive evidence from the US and
UK as well. This suggests that the primary culprit of the COVID-19 recession is
COVID-19 itself, rather than lockdowns, so that the lifting of lockdowns around
the world may lead to only modest recoveries unless the infection rates fall. The
best way to revive the labor market is to eradicate the virus.
(Gardiner and Slaughter, 2020).
16
However, our nationwide estimate of β2 shows that women lost more jobs than men in Korea, and that
within-industry effects are much more positive for men than women.
