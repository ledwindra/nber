Taxation of Intergenerational Transfers and Wealth
Wojciech Kopczuk
NBER Working Paper No. 18584
November 2012
JEL No. D31,E21,H2
ABSTRACT
In this chapter, I review empirical and theoretical literature on taxation of intergenerational transfers
(estates, bequests, inheritances, inter vivos gifts) and wealth. The main message may be summarized
as follows. Empirical evidence on bequest motivations and responses to estate taxation is spotty and
much remains be done, but what we know points in the direction of (1) mixed motives (2) heterogeneity
of preferences and (3) importance of retaining control over wealth. These patterns are important for
normative analysis of taxation toward the top of the distribution. Theoretical work should further focus
on understanding implications of inequality of inherited wealth: the topic that has been neglected in
the past, even though it is closely related to — more carefully studied, but arguably much less important
in practice — externalities from giving. Potential externalities from wealth accumulation and concentration
are yet to be seriously addressed.

Introduction

The objective of this chapter is to provide an introduction to and review of economic
literature related to taxation of transfers and wealth. As will become clear in what follows,
the focus will be primarily on taxes imposed on intergenerational transfers. Such taxes take
many different forms. Transfers that occur at death may be taxed in the form of estate
taxation, i.e. the tax may be imposed on the total amount of wealth left by the decedent.
They may take the form of an inheritance tax, in which case the base is defined on the level
of the donee, and reflects the transfers to that particular individual.1 If taxes were imposed
only at death, the simplest form of avoidance would be to transfer resources inter vivos
(during lifetime). Hence transfer taxation systems usually include a tax on gifts as well.2
Taxes on estates are a form of a tax on wealth and, although it is rare, some countries (e.g.,
France and Norway) impose annual taxes of that kind.
Transfer and wealth taxes have unique features that make them different than other types of
direct taxation. First of all, they inherently affect two related parties so that the distortion
affects a transaction (transfer) that is not arms-length and that may involve externalities.
This makes understanding and assumptions about transfer motives central to both positive
and normative analysis. Second, they are infrequent (at the extreme, occurring just at
death), thereby allowing for a long period of planning, making expectations about future
tax policy critical and empirical identification of the effect of incentives particularly hard.
Potentially large amounts of money at stake make investment in tax avoidance worthwhile
in the presence of fixed costs and incentives to do so are potentially quite salient. Third,
in practice, this type of taxation often applies only to a small but important group of
individuals — those with sufficiently high wealth at the time of taxation — and thus plays
a potentially important role in overall distributional implications of taxation, both in the
short and in the long-term.
There are many dimensions of differences in the implementation of transfer taxation across
countries, states and over time. On the basic design level, the estate tax may treat preferentially transfers to the spouse or charity, inheritance tax may vary depending on the
relationship to the donor, gifts may be taxed on annual or lifetime basis, they may be
integrated (or not) with taxation at death, details of interaction with capital gains taxation regime may vary. Many features of implementation of the tax may matter greatly —
some examples are valuation rules, preferences for particular types of assets, treatment of
1
Inheritance taxation may in principle be integrated with personal income taxation, see Batchelder (2009)
for a discussion and a proposal for the reform of the U.S. transfer tax system along these lines.
2
The actual implementation does vary though. For example, in the U.S., the estate tax operated without
a gift tax from 1916 until 1932, and since then gifts made within three years of death may be subject to
different treatment than those made earlier (if made in “contemplation of death;” they were automatically
included in estate between 1976 and 1981, see Luckey, 2008 for the history of provisions). In the UK, there
is no tax on gifts made more than seven years before death (though there was one between 1975 and 1984,
see Boadway et al., 2010b for the discussion of changes).

transfers shortly before death, treatment of marital assets, implications of joint vs community property, treatment of charity, and treatment of transfers that skip generations. The
purpose of this chapter is not to discuss all of these issues, although in Section 2 I will
provide a short overview of history of the estate tax in the United States and international
differences in transfer tax systems. Instead, my objective is to focus on the economics of
transfer taxation and to offer a critical review of related theoretical and empirical research.
This research is of course largely motivated by the existing forms of taxation. In particular,
empirical work naturally relies on what can be observed in practice and some of it is directly
motivated by important current policy questions. Most, though not all, of research on these
topics took place in the United States and hence the “bias” toward evidence (and salient
policy questions) from the U.S. will be present. However, the focus of the chapter is on taxation of transfers in general, with the U.S. being just a (prominent) example. I will discuss
taxation of wealth briefly, to the extent that it relates to taxation of transfers (rather than
being a form of tax on capital incomes that is discussed elsewhere in this Handbook).
This is not the first survey of literature related to transfers and their taxation. Gale and
Slemrod (2001) and Boadway et al. (2010a) provide useful background to the issues surrounding the design of transfer taxation. Cremer and Pestieau (2006) discuss some theoretical contributions to the literature on taxation of bequests. Laitner (1997), Laferrère and
Wolff (2006) and Arrondel and Masson (2006) discuss theoretical and empirical work on
intergenerational linkages. Davies and Shorrocks (2000) and Cagetti and De Nardi (2008)
cover work on wealth distribution. Luckey (2008) and Joulfaian (2011) provide excellent
overviews of the history of estate tax legislations in the United States.
Before dwelling into details, it is worth emphasizing the structure, major themes and conclusions of this review.
I will begin in the next section with a brief overview of how taxation of this kind works and
varies in practice — across countries, across states in the United States, and over time.
In Section 3, I discuss evidence on bequest motives and basic normative implications of
different motives for thinking about taxation. Bequest motives are the key building block
for theoretical analysis of taxation of transfers, but the empirical literature has not settled
on a clear answer to the question about the nature of bequest motivations. I emphasize
heterogeneity of two different kinds. First, search for the bequest motive is unlikely to be
fruitful — saving plays dual role of protecting against lifetime risk and increasing transfers to others. Different motivations for transfers are not mutually exclusive — the same
person may be altruistic and yet interested in controlling wealth or engaged in strategic
interactions with children. Second, I emphasize the evidence suggesting that preferences
are heterogeneous and do not necessarily cut across predictable lines (such as having kids).
The primary conclusion of this section is that theoretical work should either be somewhat
agnostic (general) about the nature of the bequest motive or it should explicitly account
3

for heterogeneity.
In Section 4, I focus on the main theoretical framework for analyzing bequests taxation
that builds on Mirrlees (1971) and Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) approach to taxation of
commodities in the presence of nonlinear income taxation, adapted to transfer context by
Kaplow (1998, 2001). This approach of course incorporates redistributive preferences for a
policy maker. The basic insight is that transfers can be modeled as a form of consumption,
albeit one with two unusual but related features. First, transfers directly benefit someone
else besides the donor. Second, the presence of such a benefit may generate a form of
externality from giving. An externality from giving is natural to consider in this context
and provides a reason for subsidizing rather than taxing bequests. I discuss the logic of
corrective taxation of externalities in a context with individualized rather than atmospheric
externality and conclude that externalities from giving are not important for thinking about
taxation at the top of the distribution: that is, they are irrelevant precisely where taxation
of transfers is important in practice. Furthermore, I point out that theoretical implications
of inequality in received inheritances are not yet fully understood and are likely to lead to
arguments for positive taxation of bequests. I then discuss work on capital income taxation
more generally and point out its relationship to transfer taxation.
In Section 5, I begin to review empirical evidence on the effects of taxation of transfers.
The focus of that section is on “real” responses — changes in the volume and timing of
actual transfers, effect on labor supply, capital gains realizations, charity and transfer and
survival of businesses. I follow up in Section 6 with the discussion of responses that fall
along the avoidance margin. That section is focused primarily on evidence that applies to
people with significant net worth and the key message of this discussion is that transfer tax
planning involves a trade-off between tax minimization and control over wealth.
Section 7 is devoted to a few other topics that do not naturally fit elsewhere. I elaborate
further on the relationship of estate taxation and the shape of wealth distribution, discuss
empirical work related to charitable bequests, and briefly comment on research on marital
bequests, tax competition and political economy of this type taxation. The final section
concludes.
The main message of this chapter may be summarized as follows. Empirical evidence
on bequest motivations and responses to estate taxation is spotty and much remains be
done, but what we know points in the direction of (1) mixed motives (2) heterogeneity
of preferences and (3) importance of retaining control over wealth. Incorporating these
components of empirical evidence into theoretical analysis is crucial, and especially so when
thinking about taxation toward the top of the distribution. Theoretical work should further
focus on understanding implications of inequality of inherited wealth: the topic that has
been neglected in the past, even though it is closely related to — more carefully studied but
arguably much less important in practice — externalities from giving. Finally, potential
4

negative externalities from wealth accumulation and concentration are yet to be seriously
addressed.

Overview of wealth and estate taxation in practice

Taxation at death is administratively convenient: this is the time when assets change hands
and need to be valued anyway, thereby increasing tax administration’s ability to observe
them. Wealth is arguably easier to observe than income, and taxes on wealth — most
importantly on land but also on successions — have historically preceded taxation of income.
Following the development of modern forms of income and consumption taxation, estate
and wealth taxes are rarely a major source of revenue. However, they remain an unusually
progressive component of the tax code. Limited revenue makes elimination of such taxes a
realistic policy proposal and, indeed, a number of developed countries (for example, Canada,
Sweden and Australia and some states in the United States) repealed such taxes. Large
financial stakes for a limited number of wealthy taxpayers make politics surrounding these
issues contentious and subject to massive lobbying (Graetz and Shapiro, 2005).
Luckey (2008) and Joulfaian (2011) provide excellent and detailed overviews of the history
of estate and inheritance taxation in the United States. A reader interested in state provisions should consult Bakija (2007) and sources referenced there. Gale and Slemrod (2001),
Boadway et al. (2010b) and Scheve and Stasavage (2012) provide international comparison
of transfer tax systems and rates for a few developed countries. An older discussion by
Bird (1991) provides a comparison of inheritance taxes and annual wealth taxation for both
developed and developing countries. Able reviews of economic aspects of inheritance tax
systems exist for a number of other countries — for example, Boadway et al. (2010a) present
detailed overview of inheritance taxation in the U.K., Ohlsson (2011) does so for Sweden
and Piketty (2011) describes the French system.
The United States instituted a number of short-lived inheritance or estates taxes3 in the 18th
and 19th century: the Death Stamp Tax was in place between 1789-1802, an inheritance
tax during the Civil War, and an estate tax during the Spanish-American War.4 A number
of states had estate or inheritance taxes before the turn of the 20th century. The modern
estate tax was enacted in 1916 with initial rates ranging from 1 to 10% and exemption of
$50,000. The rates changed often before the top rate reached its peak of 77% by 1941, where
it stayed until 1977. The estate tax was supplemented by a cumulative gift tax starting in
19325 in an effort to combat tax avoidance.6

The base of the tax was subject to numerous changes over the years. Tax treatment of
marital transfers used to be a controversial issue in the early years of the estate tax, in
part due to different marital property regimes in place in different states: in community
property states half of property acquired during marriage belongs to each spouse and thus
was automatically excluded from the estate, while in the remaining states such property
originally could be excluded only to the extent that the surviving spouse could be shown
to have contributed to its acquisition. This was perceived as inequitable and in 1942 the
Congress attempted to address it by extending non-community property treatment to the
community property states; this solution was considered complex and was replaced by
marital deduction in 1948. Initially, half of adjusted gross estate was eligible for marital
deduction (but community property was not); this was modified to allow for the marital
deduction equal to the adjusted gross estate or $250,000 (whichever was greater) in 1977,
and then unlimited marital deduction as of 1982.
Until 1976, gift and estate taxes were separate. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 introduced a
uniform tax with a single tax schedule applying to the sum of cumulative lifetime taxable
gifts and the estate; allowing, in particular, for a unified estate and gift tax credit (equivalent
to a lifetime exemption). The same act also introduced a Generation Skipping Transfer Tax
that imposes an additional layer of tax liability for certain transfers to grandchildren and
related transactions. The effective exemption was increased at the same time from $60,000
(where it was since 1942) to $120,667 stopping the process of inflation-driven “bracket
creep” that pushed the number of taxable tax returns to its all-time maximum of 7.65%
of all deaths by 1976 (in contrast, the tax affected fewer than 2% of decedents in other
periods). At the same time, the top tax rate was reduced to 70%. The additional rate
reductions and increases in exemption level were enacted in 1981 and phased in over the
number of following years, bringing the top rate to 55% and the exemption to $600,000 by
1987 where it stayed for more than a decade.
A number of other changes took place in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The 1976 reform
attempted to introduce a carryover basis for capital gains. Capital gains that are not
realized at the time of death are subject to the estate tax but escape capital gains taxation
due to step-up provision that modifies the tax basis of the asset to its value at the time
of death of the original owner. The carryover approach was intended to eliminate such
resetting of the basis so that capital gains tax would still be due on full accumulation when
a beneficiary ultimately sells the asset. This provision had, however, been delayed first and
then repealed before it became effective. The same reform also changed treatment of gifts
shortly before death by requiring that any gifts within three years of death be included in
the estate (rather than relying on gifts in “contemplation of death”). During the 1980s, a
same, gift and estate taxes are calculated differently — gifts are taxed on a tax exclusive basis while estate
tax applies to tax-inclusive base, resulting in higher effective marginal tax rates for estates than for gifts
(see footnote 39).

number of changes benefiting closely-held businesses and farms were introduced, including
alternate valuation rules, installment payments and special rules applying to qualified family
businesses.
In 2001, the estate tax was “repealed” — the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 enacted a 10-year schedule of reductions in rates and increases in exemption
of the tax that was supposed to culminate in a repeal in 2010. The whole legislation was
scheduled to sunset at the end of 2010 so that, absent additional action, the repeal would
last one year only, at which point the schedule would return to their 2001 shape. Few, if any,
observers expected this sequence of events to play itself out and yet this is almost exactly
what happened: for most of 2010 there was no estate tax on the books, for the first time
since 1916. At the end of 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization,
and Job Creation Act of 2010 reinstated the estate tax in a modified form. While this
provision was retroactive, estates for decedents who died in 2010 had an option of electing
out of the estate tax. Such decision is not without trade-offs — assets passed in that way
will not benefit from the step up in basis at death and instead will effectively be subject to
carryover basis treatment for capital gains purposes — but it is expected that few estates
will choose to pay the estate tax in 2010 (data is not available yet). The provisions enacted
in 2010 are temporary and apply to 2011 and 2012. Without further action, the estate tax
will revert to its 2001 form as of 2013.
Even prior to the“repeal”, changes in the 2000s were substantial — the exemption increased
from $675,000 in 2001 to $3.5 million in 2009 and the maximum rate fell from 55% to 45%.
The reinstated tax features an even larger exemption ($5 million) and lower top rate (35%).
The implications of the 2010 repeal are yet to be studied (or even observed given the lags
involved in filing and publication of statistics). Over that period, the number of estate tax
returns filed (the date-of-death numbers are not yet available for most recent years) declined
from over 108,000 in 2001 to 15,000 in 2010; and the number of taxable returns fell from
over 50,000 to 6,700; however the reduction in net estate tax liability was much smaller
than these numbers and tax reductions might suggest: it fell from $23 billion to $13 billion,
primarily reflecting skeweness of the wealth distribution.7 Changes in rates that applied to
estates, applied also to gifts. The sole exception was the 2010 repeal: the gift tax remained
in place throughout that year. As of 2012, the future of the estate and gift taxation in the
United States remains uncertain.
There are many differences in how transfer taxation could be implemented in practice.
The United States federal tax is a tax on estates — the overall value of wealth left by a
decedent. Somewhat similar structure is present in the U.K. and other English-speaking
countries (or was present before the tax was repealed — as in the case of Canada). An
alternative approach — in place in some U.S. states (for example, Indiana, Maryland,
7

Pennsylvania, New Jersey) and in many continental European countries — is to impose
a tax on inheritances, that is to shift the base to the recipient. This has two noteworthy
implications: the overall tax liability depends on how estate is distributed and tax payments
may be made dependent on the relationship to the donee in a straightforward way. Indeed,
it is common for inheritance tax systems to vary tax liability depending on the relationship,
usually with preferences for close relatives.8 Yet another possibility — rarely in place in
practice — is to integrate transfer tax with income tax system so that inheritances increase
income tax base.9
Taxation of transfers is not the only way of imposing a general tax on wealth. Mintz
(1991) and Auerbach (2008) discuss many different forms such taxes can take. Obviously,
many types of taxation of income from wealth (interests, capital gains, dividends etc.) are
common. Taxation of particular forms of wealth — property, land, certain durable goods
— is also often in place. Taxation of capital income is discussed in a separate chapter of
the Handbook and taxes imposed on particular goods raise many interesting issues related
to these specific markets but are not the focus of this chapter. Some countries — for
example, France and Norway — also impose a net worth tax (usually annual). Brown
(1991) carefully analyzes administrative difficulties in implementing an annual net wealth
tax and concludes that practical problems are intractable. Adam et al. (2011) assert that
practical difficulties and actual experience of the implementation in countries that tried to
do it have been discouraging. Defining base in a comprehensive manner is difficult — it
requires costly and sometimes impractical valuation, especially in the case of business assets.
Naturally, taxation of “human capital” in this way is not a realistic option. Deviating from
the comprehensive basis, as is done in practice, allows for tax avoidance opportunities. A
regular tax on wealth is closely related to a tax on capital income. As Adam et al. (2011)
point out though, net worth tax predominantly taxes the normal rate of return rather than
excess return. In particular, under wealth taxation exempting the normal rate of return is
not a realistic option, thereby making it a less desirable form of taxation than direct taxes on
capital income.10 The main advantage of this form of taxation over capital income taxation
is its ability to tax assets that do not generate income (in particular, due to tax avoidance).
8

Estate tax systems do allow for some adjustments to the overall tax liability depending on the recipient
through deductions — for example, in the U.S. transfers to a spouse or to a charity are fully deductible.
In principle, one could also imagine introducing variation in rates through tax credits for gifts to specific
recipients; naturally though inheritance taxation makes such adjustments much less complex.
9
See Batchelder (2009) for an extensive discussion of this possibility. In particular, she reports that a
few countries (Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania and Russia) include gifts in the income tax base. A short-lived
(struck down as unconstitutional) 1894 U.S. income and inheritance tax was supposed to include inheritances
as part of the income tax base.
10
Using Adam et al. (2011) example, assume that the normal rate of return is 5%. A 20% capital income
tax is equivalent to upfront 1% wealth tax. Both systems discourage saving, but under capital income tax
excess return is taxed at 20%, while wealth tax exempts it. Shifting the net worth tax in this example to the
second period makes only minor difference by taxing excess returns lightly (at 1% if keeping the present value
of revenue constant). Exempting the normal rate of return under net worth tax would effectively wipe out
tax liability, while doing so under capital income taxation is conceivable. Such an approach (rate-of-return
allowance, RRA) has in fact been implemented in Norway.

8

Transfer taxation, on which this chapter mostly focuses, retains this property and takes
advantage of the administratively convenient (even if unpopular) timing — death — when
assets change hands anyway so that they are more easily observable and when difficult
valuation issues often would need to be addressed anyway, thereby easing tax compliance
burden.

3.1

Bequest motives and taxation
Single generation

In order to systematize the discussion of theoretical arguments related to transfer taxation,
it is instructive to start with a single individual utility maximization problem. Consider
an individual maximizing utility u(C, B) defined over consumption (C) and transfers to a
beneficiary (B), subject to the budget constraint C + pB = y where y is income, p is the
relative price of transfers and the price of consumption is normalized to one. Individuals
will naturally set uB /uC = p and changes in p and y will give rise to price and substitution
responses.
Let’s denote the pre-tax relative price of bequests by R (absent taxation we have p = R;
one natural interpretation is as R = (1 + r)−1 where r is the rate of return). The base
for the estate tax is y − C and, denoting the estate tax rate by t, the budget constraint is
(1 − t)C + RB = (1 − t)y or, equivalently, C +

R
1−t B

= y. The estate tax increases relative

price of bequests and stimulates negative substitution response and further reduction of
bequests via income effect (unless bequests are an inferior good). Imposing a tax on the
basis of the amount received by the beneficiary (as is done in the case of gift taxation in
the U.S.) would instead correspond to the tax liability of tG B, the budget constraint of
C + R(1 + tG )B = y and identical predictions about the direction of the response.
This simple formulation is an example of a particular type of bequest motive — the “joyof-giving” or “warm-glow” — and is the baseline reduced-form approach used in analyzing
implications of taxation of bequests or charitable contributions when the focus is on the
donor only (Andreoni, 1990).
The assumption here is that bequests are just as any other consumption good in that
they deliver utility to the giver and correspondingly respond to price incentives. This is
an assumption that may not hold in practice. The simplest alternative is to consider a
situation in which a taxpayer does not care about the amount received by the recipient
but is instead concerned with the amount of wealth W that she contributes. Using the
linear estate-tax formulation, B = (1 − t)W/R. The simplest wealth-in-utility formulation
u(C, W ) is observationally equivalent to the joy-of-giving motive, except for the implications
of taxation: the budget constraint remains C + W = y in the presence of taxation and
9

changes in taxation have no implications for individual behavior. Hence, these two very
similar formulations — joy-of-giving and wealth-in-utility — have very different implications
when considering responses to and efficiency cost of taxation.
This approach (also referred to as “capitalistic spirit,” following Weber, 1958) has been
advocated in the literature modeling the top end of wealth distribution as a suitable way
of representing motives of high net worth individuals (Carroll, 2000; Reiter, 2004; Francis,
2009), the topic to which we will return in Section 7.1. Some possible justifications for
considering wealth-in-utility are either as an intrinsic utility from accumulating wealth
or as a proxy for unmodeled benefits of wealth holding — power that it allows to exert
over others, relaxing of borrowing constraints, precautionary benefits or using wealth as a
measure of relative status (eg. due to positional externalities as in Frank, 2008).
An alternative model of bequests that do not yield utility to the donor is the “accidental”
bequest approach. In the life-cycle framework with uncertain lifespan (Yaari, 1965), individuals save for future consumption but, except for the last possible period of life, may
die with positive wealth holdings. Whether that occurs depends on actuarial fairness of
the market for annuities: if annuities are fairly priced, all consumption should be effectively annuitized and bequests would not occur (instead, insurance company would gain ex
post in case of early death). If the annuity market is imperfect, as the empirical evidence
suggests (Friedman and Warshawsky, 1990; Mitchell et al., 1999), people die with positive
wealth. Hence, bequests are unintended and stochastic. As with wealth-in-utility approach,
taxation has no effect on the size of bequests.
One often-repeated statement about taxation of accidental bequests is that 100% tax is
efficient because it elicits no response. While the latter part of this statement is true,
the former requires qualifications (Kopczuk, 2003b). The tax on accidental bequests in a
representative individual context indeed has the benefit of reducing “waste” — bequests
would otherwise not be available for consumption purposes. Naturally this argument does
not survive considering a more realistic context when bequests instead flow to some other
party and hence are not assumed to be wasted. In that case, the tax on accidental bequests
becomes simply equivalent to lump-sum taxation on the beneficiary. More subtly, accidental
bequests reflect the presence of an underlying imperfections in the market for annuities. A
taxpayer would clearly be better off by selling the right to (unintended) bequest conditional
on dying at some time t (that has no value to him) and using proceeds for consumption in
any other period. While confiscating a bequest of this kind yields no harm, it also does not
directly address the underlying market failure. The first-best policy would instead allow for
complete consumption smoothing via annuities and imply no accidental bequest.
Kopczuk (2003b) shows that the estate tax itself may play an annuity role: the insight is
that given interest rate r and sequence of effective tax liabilities Ti conditional on dying in
period i, surviving from period i to period i+1 implies a reduction of lifetime tax liability by
10

i+1
. The presence of this implicit annuity increases the value of the tax on accidental
Ti − T1+r

bequests — by using confiscatory tax on bequests, one reduces tax payments relative to the
alternative of unconditional lifetime taxation with the same present value — but it becomes
of more interest when individuals have additionally an explicit bequest motive where it can
be shown that (1) a small estate tax is welfare improving because of its annuity role and
(2) under strong enough bequest motive, sufficiently flexible estate tax can implement the
first-best solution.11

3.2

Intergenerational links

The discussion so far abstracted from the recipients of transfers. From the point of view of
understanding bequest behavior the recipients may matter because the donor may respond
to their characteristics or behavior. Furthermore, transfers — actual or expected — may
also change the behavior of a recipient. For normative analysis, understanding implications
of transfers for welfare of the recipient is important.
The most influential way of modeling intergenerational linkages is by introducing altruistic
preferences à la Barro (1974). It is assumed that prior generation cares directly about
welfare of the following generation(s). With just two generations (parents and children)
to begin with, preferences of the parents can be expressed as uP (C P , C K ) = v P (C P ) +
ρuK (C K ) where C P is a vector of consumption goods of the parent, C K is a vector of
consumption goods of the child, v P is utility of the parent from own consumption and
uK is the utility of a child from own consumption. The parent is assumed to care about
welfare of a child but discount it at some rate ρ (presumably with ρ < 1). Of course, this
is a workhorse model used in hundreds of papers with many variants and extensions that
are beyond the scope of this chapter (Laitner, 1997, provides a good survey of theoretical
aspects of altruistic preferences). In its simplest variant, one abstracts from overlap between
generations (C P occurs now, C K in the future) and considers maximization subject to the
common resource constraint
y P + Ry K = C P + RC K

(1)

where y P is income of parents and y K is income of children. In this formulation, bequests
are equal to the unconsumed resources of the parent y P − C P .12 The standard result is
that re-allocating resources in a lump-sum fashion between period P and period C has no
effect on the budget constraint (1) — the Ricardian equivalence result — with bequests
adjusting to offset. This implication has been tested in the context of bequests (Altonji
11

Even more generally, one can think of the estate tax as serving insurance role against other types of
risks — such as investment risk — that would affect the value of estate at death.

Perhaps augmented by investment returns R−1 , depending on the assumed convention about whether
transfer occurs at the end of period when P generation is alive or the beginning of period when the C
generation is active.

et al., 1992; Wilhelm, 1996; Altonji et al., 1997; Laitner and Ohlsson, 2001) and soundly
rejected. Another way of describing the implication is by noting that it calls for smoothing
P = ρRuK . With multiple potential beneficiaries (e.g., multiple
of marginal utility profile vC
C

children), this condition should hold for any beneficiary — a conclusion that is not consistent
with the pattern of equal bequest splitting documented in the literature (Menchik, 1980;
Menchik and David, 1983; Light and McGarry, 2004).13
To understand implications for bequests, it is useful to explicitly consider a single period of
life so that C P and C K are scalars and the parent’s optimization problem is max v P (C P ) +
B,C P

is the after-tax cost of

a dollar transfer to the beneficiary. This formulation makes it clear that when the focus is
on donors’ behavior only, there is a close connection between this model and the warm-glow
one: parents care about their own consumption and bequests, except that the marginal
value of bequests depends on the income of a child. Abel and Warshawsky (1988) build
on this argument to show how intensity of altruism relates to the strength of the joy-ofgiving bequest motive in a model with infinite horizon (although the relationship that they
establish is not invariant to changes in taxation).
An alternative approach to bequests treats them as a transaction between parents and
children with bequests compensating children for services that they provide to their parents,
such as direct help, attention, access to grandchildren etc. (Bernheim et al., 1985; Cox, 1987;
Perozek, 1998).14 As with altruism, evidence in support of the exchange motive is mixed,
see Arrondel and Masson (2006) and Laferrère and Wolff (2006) for recent surveys.
The conclusion that arises in the most recent work on bequest motives is that searching
for the bequest motive is unlikely to be successful. This is for two reasons. First, different
motives are not exclusive — in the presence of uncertainty, the precautionary/accidental
and intentional motives naturally co-exist (Dynan et al., 2002, 2004); a person may also
have a mix of altruistic and exchange motivations, or simultaneously put weight on both
wealth and bequests for example.
Second, different individuals may have different motives. For example, Light and McGarry
(2004) document heterogeneity in preference for leaving bequests based on verbatim answers
given to a question about reasons for planning not to split bequests equally in National
Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women and Mature Women. Laitner and Juster (1996),
13

Bernheim and Severinov (2003) propose an explanation for equal splitting that is based on the assumption that children care about altruistic parent’s affection and infer it based in part on observable bequests.
Severinov (2006) shows that this model can generate transfer patterns that are very similar to those under
standard altruism but does not imply Ricardian equivalence. Dunn and Phillips (1997) and McGarry (1999)
provides evidence that (presumably harder to observe) inter vivos gifts are compensatory while bequests are
split equally.
14
Exchange motives give rise to “strategic” interactions between parents and children, but strategic interactions naturally arise in the multi-period altruistic context as well (Bruce and Waldman, 1991; Coate,
1995).

12

based on a survey of TIAA-Cref participants, show that the intention to leave a bequest is
not universal and, in fact, does not seem to be even remotely close to being well explained
by having children — 45% people with children consider bequests important relative to 21%
of the childless ones.
Hurd (1987) shows that wealth profiles of people with and without children are similar.
Using cross-sectional AHEAD/HRS data and a structural approach to modeling wealth
profiles, Hurd (1989) allows for accidental and intended (joy-of-giving) bequests and tests
for the presence of a bequest motive by assuming that people with kids have one and those
without them do not. Given similarity of wealth profiles for those with and without children,
he rejects that a bequest motive is present. Noting evidence in Laitner and Juster (1996)
suggesting that children are unlikely to be a deterministic indicator of the presence of a
bequest motive, Kopczuk and Lupton (2007) extend this approach to exploit longitudinal
information and allow kids to be just one of the many potential (but non-deterministic)
indicators of the presence of the motive in a switching regression framework with unknown
sample separation. They conclude that bequest motive is present (in fact, their parameters
indicate that 3/4 of the population has one), but only weakly related to having children.
Ameriks et al. (2011) model saving for long-term care and bequest motives; they use very
similar switching regression strategy as Kopczuk and Lupton (2007) to conclude that both
public long-term care aversion and bequest motives are important. Both of these papers
find evidence supporting heterogeneity of the presence of the motive and they both find
that bequests are a mix of accidental and intentional ones. The intentional bequests are
effectively modeled as a luxury good. The results indicate that intentional bequest motive is
not operational for much of the distribution where accidental bequest dominates. However,
both type of motives become quantitatively important at higher levels of wealth.
Using estate tax data for filers in 1977, Kopczuk (2007) shows that wealth accumulation
for the very wealthy continues until the onset of a terminal illness but that tax avoidance
is responsive to that event, supporting the notion that people value both lifetime wealth
and bequests. In the survey of literature on bequest motives, Arrondel and Masson (2006)
advocate a mix of altruistic and strategic motives. The literature on the determinants of
savings and wealth distribution grappled with this question as well (it will be discussed
in more detail in Section 7.1). A strand of this literature assumes away the presence of
a bequest motive (Hubbard et al., 1994, 1995; Scholz et al., 2006), but it has problems
explaining the very top of the wealth distribution. Adding an explicit bequest motive
helps (De Nardi, 2004; Cagetti and De Nardi, 2008; Reiter, 2004), but the standard in the
literature approach of assuming altruism is not able to generate sufficient skewness within
the top 1% or so. Hence, researchers are often resorting to reduced form specifications of
the wealth-in-utility or warm-glow kind (though, as mentioned before, the choice between
the two is not innocuous when considering implications of tax policy).

3.3

Normative issues

The lack of consensus about the nature of bequest motives makes reaching definitive theoretical conclusions about the impact of taxation difficult and it makes normative analysis hard
because it (often) requires taking a stand on the unknown nature of the bequest motive.15
Before engaging in a normative analysis, it is worthwhile to pause to understand what role
taxation might play. To do so, consider a parent with utility of uP (C, W, B, X) where W
is wealth, B is effective bequest, X are other variables describing interaction with the child
(attention, services, non-monetary transfers); and a child with a reduced-form utility of
uK (B, X). Suppose that the social planner is interested in maximizing the weighted sum
of utilities
uP + βuK

(2)

subject to the relevant resource constraint. The nature of the transfer motive, details of
the household bargaining problems, strategic interactions between parents and children
influence the value of the objective. The outcome need not be efficient in general — for
example, addressing the Samaritan’s dilemma problem may require commitment on the part
of the parents. The outcome need not also be fair — in the exchange context, the market
power may be on the side of the parent or on the side of the child and need not reflect social
preferences. Hence, there may be a conceivable justification of an intervention to address
the potential inefficiency or redistribute resources within family. While not dismissing the
relevance of such concerns, tax treatment of bequests or gifts is a blunt instrument for
addressing them. In what follows, I will abstract from the issues that would call for the
government intervention into family problem unless they explicitly relate to bequests. In
particular, I will assume that the government respects the outcome of the family problem
as efficient, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The main reasons for a departure of government objective from respecting the maximization
of family objective function considered in the literature has to do with the potential presence
of externalities from giving (Kaplow, 1995, 1998). A dollar of bequests provides utility to
both parents and children. From the social point of view, the benefit of a bequest is given
by uPB + ρuK
B , but when maximizing her own utility the parent is only taking into account
her own marginal benefit uPB and ignores the ρuK
B component giving rise to an interpersonal
externality. This externality is there regardless of the bequest motive if one accounts for
welfare of a child beyond its effect on parent’s utility. In many cases, this is a natural
approach. For example, when the bequest motive has the warm-glow structure, the parent
does not care about the utility of a child and instead is assumed to derive the utility from
15

Kopczuk (2001) and Cremer and Pestieau (2006) analyze bequest taxation using models that have
different types of bequest motives as special cases.

14

the value of a gift itself. Naturally then, one is inclined to consider bequests as being
under-provided: the benefit that they deliver to the donee is not taken into account by the
donor.
Selecting the normative criterion under altruistic model is more controversial, because parent’s preferences already explicitly depend on child’s utility. Writing, as before, the parental
utility as uP (C P , C K ) = v P (C P ) + ρuK (C K ), the social planner’s objective that accounts
for both utility of the parent and the child becomes uP + βuK = v P + (ρ + β)uK . In
the special case when β = 0, the social planner simply maximizes parental welfare. This
is of course the standard approach of focusing on dynastic welfare. If instead β > 0, it
corresponds to social planner putting an extra weight on welfare of children beyond what
parents do.16
The key thing to observe is that normative analysis requires taking a stand on the presence of
such an externality. In standard cases such as altruistic preferences or joy-of-giving bequest
motive, the externality is caused by bequests and it is positive. As the result, its presence
calls for corrective policies that would address the external effect. The Pigouvian subsidy
to bequests that corrects the parental incentive to internalize the externality is the optimal
policy in the first-best. In the second-best Ramsey commodity tax problems, it calls for
adjustments to the tax structure but, as Sandmo (1975) shows, these adjustments should
be targeted to the source of the externality — i.e., lead to a subsidy to bequests. Kopczuk
(2003a) shows that the “targeting principle” logic applies to general tax problems with
atmospheric externality (i.e., an externality that is generated by aggregate consumption)
as long as the source of the externality can be taxed directly.
Considering an externality from giving is a normative assumption. Showing that it gives rise
to subsidies to bequests is a straightforward consequence to keep in mind when evaluating
normative tax exercises even when analytics of obtaining that conclusion is complicated.
Having said that, the externality of that kind does come up naturally. Diamond (2006)
provides a normative discussion of arguments for including the warm-glow motive in the
social welfare function. In other words, the question he poses is not whether the benefit
to the donee should be explicitly counted (as arises when one considers the altruistic case),
but rather whether the benefit to the donor from the act of giving should be accounted
for. The main argument for accounting for the warm glow is obviously that warm-glow
preferences are presumed to determine behavior and hence should be accounted for by
the social planner just as preferences for any other good. The main counter-arguments
have to do with reduced-form of such preferences that may miss other benefits or costs,
and with consequences of accounting for the utility from the process (giving) rather than
consumption of resources. For example, under a naive interpretation, two parties exchanging
gifts of the same value would increase the utility of both parties with no change in ultimate
16

One could also imagine β < 0 — social planner discounting welfare of children more than parents do —
the case that has been considered in political economy models.

15

consumption. Hence, a policy subsidizing such gifts might increase welfare. Alternatively, a
policy that would substitute one-for-one bequests for direct government transfers to donees
would reduce welfare by depriving donors of the warm glow.
Phelan (2006) and Farhi and Werning (2007) explicitly analyze placing an extra weight on
future generations in an altruistic context. Considering altruism has an advantage over
reduced form motives for bequests in that it avoids placing fvalue on the act of giving
and instead focuses squarely on the final allocation of resources. The disadvantage is weak
empirical support for these types of preferences especially when considering the very top of
the distribution that estate taxation in practice is about.
Assuming that a form of an externality from giving is to be considered, there are a few
additional things to note.
First, as mentioned before, targeting prescription for dealing with externalities relies on
the presence of an instrument that can target the source of an externality directly. The
standard case is an “atmospheric externality” when the identity of the person taking action
generating the externality is irrelevant. More generally, the social planner should target
directly any source of the externality in proportion to the damage. Since with an atmospheric externality every source has the same impact on the social welfare, the tax does not
need to be differentiated. This is not the case with bequest externality: the externality is
interpersonal and, with sufficient heterogeneity, marginal social welfare impact of bequests
by different individuals will be different. This would then call for differentiating subsidies
to bequests and whether it is feasible depends on available tax instruments.
Second, and relatedly, the importance of accounting for the giving externality may vary
with the context considered. For example, one may place a high value on welfare of lowincome children but correcting for inadequate gifts by wealthy parents to their wealthy
children does not sound as an important policy objective. We will return to this issue when
considering estate taxation in a redistributive context.
To conclude, externality due to giving is often a component of the normative analysis of
estate taxation. Its presence tilts the policy in the direction of subsidies to giving. The
assumed type of a bequest motive influences the presence and nature of this externality.
Still, a normative choice may often be explicitly made: for example, one can ignore the
warm-glow or make a decision about the extra weight, if any, to be put on welfare of future
generations. The best theoretical practice is to be explicit about the presence of such an
externality and its precise consequences; in particular about the consequences of varying its
strength or its complete elimination.

4

Redistribution

In the previous section, I abstracted from redistributive motives. Taxation of estates in
practice is about closely connected with redistribution. For example, according to the
Piketty and Saez (2007) assessment of the overall progressivity of the U.S. tax code in
1970,17 the estate, gift and wealth taxes contributed 23.4 percentage points to the overall
74.6% average effective tax rate applying to the top 0.01% of the distribution, while by 2004
contribution of these taxes fell to just 2.5 points out of the 34.7% total — according to that
study, the decline in this type of taxation accounted for half of the change in effective tax
burden of the wealthiest over that period. Clearly, analyzing taxes that apply predominantly
to those with high net worth and have the potential to make such a difference in the overall
progressivity cannot ignore redistributional issues.
Building on the standard optimal income tax model of Mirrlees (1971), Kaplow (2001)
provides the starting point for thinking about redistribution and estate taxation. Focusing on the donors, consider a society consisting of individuals maximizing utility given by
u(C, L, B) where C is consumption, L is labor supply and B is bequest. As in optimal
income tax literature, assume that every individual is characterized by skill level w that
remains private information. The planner can observe income wL and bequests B and can
impose tax liability based on that information so that individuals are maximizing utility
subject to the budget constraint C + B ≤ wL − T (wL, B). Denoting by w(·) a concave
welfare function, one is interested in finding the tax schedule T (·) that maximizes welfare
´
w(u(C, L, B)) subject to the revenue and incentive compatibility constraints.
This basic framework assumes that bequests are just like any other good. It also assumes
that skills are the only source of heterogeneity. It implies that bequests are deterministic
function of labor income. It also assumes away heterogeneity in tastes that led McCaffery
(1994) to argue against estate taxation on the basis of its horizontally inequitable treatment
of savers vs spenders.
This framework is of course a special case of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) and leads to the
classic result that tax on commodities — bequests in this case — is redundant when utility
has weakly separable structure u(v(C, B), L).18 The intuition for this result can be seen
by appealing to the informational content of potential tax base. The unobservable piece of
17

The study assigns (cross-sectional) realized tax liability to groups defined by their gross income reported
on tax returns. In the case of the estate tax, they assign the current tax liability for a given group of decedents
(e.g., top 0.01% ranked by the size of estate) to the corresponding group of living taxpayers (top 0.01%,
ranked by gross income). There are many limitations to this procedure — in particular, it assumes that
top income and top estate taxpayers are the same group, it assumes that the current law will continue and
it makes no attempt to adjust for the expected differences in terminal wealth of the decedents and that of
current high income taxpayers.
18
Laroque (2005) and Kaplow (2006) show that commodity taxation is redundant even when income tax
is not optimally selected. Kaplow (2008) builds on the Atkinson-Stiglitz framework to analyze a wide range
of tax policy issues.

17

information is w. Under weak separability, one can consider a subproblem of maximizing
utility from regular consumption and bequests given labor income wL: max v(C, B) subject
C,B

to C + B ≤ wL − T (wL, B) that yields a solution (C(wL), B(wL)): consumption and
bequests are a function of labor income and do not depend on wage rate directly. In
other words, individuals with different wages will select the same level of consumption and
bequests if their incomes are the same. As the result, distorting the price of bequests
does not provide any additional information about wages beyond that already contained in
income. Hence, such a distortion is redundant.
There are many limitations of this exercise of course, some of which we will cover below (see
also Kaplow, 2001, for an extensive discussion), but it illustrates one of the components of
the analysis of the estate tax: its interaction with lifetime redistribution. Viewed in this
way, analysis of bequest taxation is analogous to analyzing desirability of capital taxation.
That literature focused on understanding implications of preference heterogeneity (Saez,
2002b; Diamond and Spinnewijn, 2010; Golosov et al., 2010) and shows that uniform tax
on capital income may be desirable even under the weak separability assumption if higher
ability individuals have a lower discount rate,19,20 while the tax on savings of just high
ability individuals may be optimal under weaker assumption. Treating bequests as a form
of saving and allowing for heterogeneity of preference for bequests would be a natural
extension of this framework.
The natural next step is to explicitly consider multiple generations. Let us consider first
the case when generations are altruistically linked, since this is the most common specification in the literature. The simplest approach builds on the Atkinson-Stiglitz framework
and continues to abstract from decisions of children, instead assuming that there are two
generations with parents choosing labor supply and consumption, and children selecting
consumption level given the transfer. The dynastic utility is given by
uP (C P , L) + ρuK (C K )

(3)

I will use this formulation in what follows. Note that bequests are present here as B = C K ,
because bequests are the only source of income for the young generation. Denoting the
pre-tax estate as E = wL − C P , the general budget constraint of the parents (and the
dynasty) may be written without loss of generality as
19

Banks and Diamond (2010) discuss empirical evidence consistent with this pattern, while Gordon and
Kopczuk (2010) test directly for a weaker condition necessary for deviation from the Atkinson-Stiglitz result
— ability of capital income to predict wages conditional on labor income — and find empirical support for
it.
20
Cremer and Pestieau (2001) show in the appendix desirability of bequest taxation in a two-type model
that violates the Atkinson-Stiglitz assumption. See also Cremer et al. (2003) who consider the context
where inheritance is not observable and show desirability of using an additional instrument (a tax on capital
income) that is informative about the unobserved inheritances.

18

C P + B/R = wL − T (wL, E)

C P + C K /R = wL − T (wL, wL − C P )

⇐⇒

(4)

where T (·, ·) is a general tax function that depends on the two observable pieces of information wL and E. In particular, observing C P and C K is redundant since they can be
recovered based on the values of wL and E.
When welfare is based on aggregating dynastic utilities, this model is again an example
of the standard Atkinson-Stiglitz framework with two consumption goods C P and C K .
Further assuming additive separability uP (C P , L) = up (C P ) − v(L) to guarantee the weak
separability assumption (as does the paper of Farhi and Werning, 2010, discussed in more
details below), the model implies no tax distortions beyond income tax at the optimum,
the point previously made by Kaplow (2001).
One might argue that the social planner should separately account for both utility of parents
and children. One way to introduce it is by putting an extra weight ν ≥ 0 on a child’s utility
when evaluating welfare of a given dynasty
uP (C P , L) + (ρ + ν)uK (C K )

(5)

This approach may be interpreted as social planner disagreeing with dynastic preferences.
Farhi and Werning (2010) consider a planner that puts an extra weight on the future
generation but they take a slightly different tack. They set up their problem in terms of
maximization of the welfare of the first period generation
ˆ
up (C P ) − v(L) + ρuK (C K )

(6)

subject to the lower bound on welfare of the second generation
ˆ
uK (C K ) ≥ V

(7)

with V indexing the problem. When V is low enough, the constraint is not binding and the
standard Atkinson-Stiglitz no-estate-tax result applies. When the constraint is binding, the
´
problem is equivalent to maximizing up (C P ) − v(L) + ρuK (C K ) + νuK (C K ) as in equation
(5) where (with some abuse of the notation) ν is the optimum value of the multiplier on
the welfare constraint for the second generation.
Whether the problem is set up by appealing to an externality from giving on the individual level or whether it introduces it on the generational level, makes no difference in the
utilitarian case. The two approaches depart from each other when applying a non-linear
19

welfare function — in one case, the welfare should be evaluated as
ˆ
W (uP (C P , L) + (ρ + ν)uK (C K ))

(8)

while in the other the welfare function is applied to parent’s and child’s utility separately,
possibly using different welfare criteria: W1 (up (C P ) − v(L) + ρuK (C K )). As the result,
given the multiplier ν on the constraint (7), the planner’s objective is
ˆ
W1 (up (C P ) − v(L) + ρuK (C K )) + νW2 (uK (C K ))

(9)

While objective functions (8) and (9) represent slightly different problems, we will see shortly
that the difference in the welfare criterion has no implications for qualitative solutions.
The objective function of the social planner does not coincide here with that of the parent
generation. Instead, it puts an extra weight on the utility of the next generation. From
the point of view of evaluating social welfare, there is a positive externality associated
with children consumption. Since in this model bequests play the sole role of determining
consumption of children, there is then a positive externality associated with bequests.

4.1

Estate taxation with externalities from giving — intuition

To gain the intuition for implications of externalities from giving note the following.
First, as has been known since (Pigou, 1920), the presence of externalities in the first best
world calls for internalizing the externality via the Pigouvian tax. Writing the dynastic
budget constraint as C P + C K /R = wL − T (wL, wL − C P ), individuals set ρRu0K =
W0

(1 − T2 )u0P . The social optimum needs to satisfy ( W20 ν + ρ)Ru0K = u0P and setting the
marginal bequest tax rate to the value of T2 ≡

W20 u0K
W10 u0P

1

(with the right hand side evaluated

at the social optimum) brings incentives in line. With sufficiently flexible instruments
(ability to pursue individualized lump-sum taxation and to set the marginal tax rates on
bequests for each individual at the corresponding Pigouvian level) to address the underlying
heterogeneity, it allows for implementing the first best allocation.
Second, the prescription for dealing with atmospheric externalities i.e. externalities stem´
ming from aggregate consumption of some dirty good D when first-best taxation is not
available but a tax on D is possible is only a slight modification of the Pigouvian taxation.
For simplicity, suppose that the effect of externality on social welfare is additive and given by
´
g( D). The logic of the targeting principle (Sandmo, 1975; Cremer et al., 1998; Kopczuk,
2003a) is straightforward. The problem with an externality is equivalent to the one without
any externalities, but with (1) the price of a dirty good adjusted (via the marginal tax rate
´
τ ) to internalize the otherwise ignored social cost of increasing D, and (2) the revenue
20

requirement modified by the amount collected by that tax (τ

´

D∗ ) at the allocation one

wishes to implement. As the result, the presence of an externality modifies the qualitative
structure of the solution only through the tax on the dirty good.21
This result calls for a linear tax at the rate that internalizes the externality. It is easy
to see that with an atmospheric externality the marginal social damage due to anyone’s
´
consumption of D is the same and given by g 0 ( D) so that the rate is indeed expected to
´
be constant. What is that rate? The social planner weighs the resource cost of D against
any other uses and the shadow price reflects the multiplier on the resource constraint µ. As
the result, the corrective rate can be shown to be equal to τ = g 0 /µ. The multiplier µ reflects
the cost of public funds and its value need not be equal to up for any particular individual,
so that the correction departs from person-by-person Pigouvian correction of externality
and, in fact, it will usually depart on average because µ also reflects the distortionary cost
of taxation.22
Third, it is not important that the externality is aggregate, rather what is important is
that there is an instrument that can target it directly. In particular, if the dirty good is
´
consumed by a subset of individuals D̃, so that it’s given by g( D̃ D), the optimal correction
remains g 0 /µ. This applies even when there is a single individual consuming the good: the
correction of an externality weighs on one hand its social cost and on the other hand revenue
implications. Furthermore, multiple externalities need not be a problem if each of them can
be targeted independently (or, if they are linked in a way that allows restricted instruments
to work as well as independent targeting).23
Coming back to the externalities from transfers, the complication is that there is not a
single atmospheric externality here and instead one can think of the problem as involving
a continuum of externalities given by νW1 (uK (C K )) for each dynasty. The straightforward
application of the targeting principle would then call for a continuum of taxes targeting
each of these externalities separately at the rate of −R

νW10 u0K
µ

(with the minus sign, because

it is a positive rather than a negative externality and with R reflecting the price of C K
relative to the numeraire C P ). If it is possible to implement such a scheme that would force
each individual to internalize the giving externalities that she causes, and if the externality

The second-best Pigouvian rate can also be written as τ = MCF
where λ is some weighted average
λ
of individual utilities and MCF = µλ is the marginal cost of public funds. Writing the optimal tax schedule

Interestingly, as shown by Sandmo (1998), when T 0 > 0 and income is a normal good this means that
MCF < 1 — raising funds can be accomplished more cheaply than using a lump-sum tax. This is because
lump-sum taxation is a potential instrument here, but it is revealed to have an interior solution at the
optimum due to redistributive considerations. Consequently, the optimal way of collecting revenue on the
margin relies on a mix of lump-sum tax and distortionary taxation.

See for example Green and Sheshinsky (1976) and Micheletto (2008) for explorations of corrective taxation when externalities are not uniform and cannot be targeted using independent instruments.

21

does not interact with other considerations (most importantly, with incentive constraints),
the optimal prescription follows the principle of targeting: forcing individuals to internalize
the externality turns the problem into the standard one without an externality present. In
such a case, adding the giving externality on top of the Atkinson-Stiglitz setup should yield
a tax targeting its source (if feasible to implement) with no qualitative modifications to the
optimal tax schedule implications otherwise. In particular, under weak separability assumption, the sole role of distortions to bequest decisions would then stem from internalization
of the externality.

4.2

Estate taxation with giving externalities — results

The intuition described in the previous section applies directly to the analysis of Farhi and
Werning (2010) who allow for imposing an extra weight on the welfare of future generations
and embed the analysis in the optimal income/consumption tax problem. Their central
result is indeed that the optimal “implicit” marginal estate tax rate is given by tE =
−R

νW10 u0K
µ

or, reinterpreting, it is equal to the optimal estate tax rate when the externality

is not present (trivially, equal to zero because of the weak separability assumption) plus the
Pigouvian correction. Under their assumptions, the marginal estate tax rate tE is only a
function of bequest (or child’s consumption):
tE (B) = −

Rν 0
W (uK (B))u0K (B)
µ 1

(10)

(obviously, R, µ and ν are constant). They show that the size of bequests (B) and the estate
(wL − C P ) are increasing function of wages, so that this desired marginal incentive may be
implemented using either a tax on estates or a tax on inheritances that is separable from
the income tax. This can be seen by integrating tE (B) over B to obtain the tax liability
that a person who at the optimum leaves the bequest of B should face:

Rν
T̃ (w) = c̃ −
µ

B(w)
ˆ

W10 (uK (x))u0K (x) dx = c −

Rν
W1 (uk (B(w)))
µ

(11)

0

where B(w) is bequest left by person w and c is an arbitrary constant. Finally, denoting
estate of person w as Ẽ(w) yields the estate tax schedule implementing the correct marginal
incentives of T (E) = T̃ (Ẽ −1 (E)). Implementing such a scheme requires an adjustment to
the optimal income tax schedule as well, but again this is feasible to implement.
While imposing continuum of corrective taxes to deal with continuum of interpersonal
externalities from giving may have seemed like a daunting task, it turns out feasible under
the assumptions of one-dimensional heterogeneity that implies that estates and bequests

22

increase with the type. Furthermore, in this case, the implementation takes a form of
estate taxation.
There are a few interesting features of this result. First, it is an explicit characterization of
the optimal estate tax structure. Second, the rates are negative everywhere — tE (B) < 0.
This should not come as a surprise because the sole role that the tax plays here is addressing
the externality from giving. Third, quite unusually in the optimal tax literature, there is a
clear result about the profile of the marginal tax rates: the tax wedge that individuals are
facing — characterized by equation (10) — is decreasing with the size of bequest (and, by
implication, also with the type and with the size of estate because all three are monotonically
related). This is because the marginal tax rate is a function of W10 (uK (B))u0K (B) that is
declining due to concavity of welfare function and utility (a slightly weaker assumption of
W1 (u(·)) being concave would also be sufficient).
Farhi and Werning (2010) describe this result as demonstrating progressivity of the optimal
estate tax schedule. Progressive subsidies are not the first thing that comes to mind when
thinking about treatment of estate taxation for redistributive purposes. As should be clear
from the discussion above, this result is purely driven by the assumed externality from
giving. Effectively, the role of the estate tax is to facilitate redistribution across generations
within the same dynasty, rather than within generations — the latter role is played by
income taxation. Hence, the message does not fall far from the basic Atkinson-Stiglitz logic
— redistribution across members of the same generation or across dynasties does not call
for estate taxation.
There is one important feature of the solution that should be pointed out: asymptotically,
the marginal estate tax rate goes to zero, because the marginal utility tends to zero as wages
and bequests increase. As Kopczuk (2009) suggested and Kaplow (2009) further elaborates,
for the purpose of evaluating marginal tax rates at the top of the distribution, externalities
from giving are irrelevant. The intuition is simply that even if such an externality is present
and recognized by the social planner, it involves transfers between wealthy parents and
wealthy children. Hence, the marginal impact on overall welfare is negligible when bequests
are large but, as seen before, the cost of addressing externalities is driven by the overall
cost of public funds and hence non-negligible.
This analysis could be easily extended to incorporate other types of bequest motives.
For example, analysis with the joy-of-giving motive is almost identical. Consider using
u(C P , L) + v(B) rather than preferences in (3) and continue to assume that the utility of
the child is u(C K ). In this formulation, B = C K , so that the objective of the planner that
puts weight ν on the next generation can be expressed as u(C P , L) + v(C K ) + νu(C K ): the
only difference relative to objective under altruism (formula 5) is the joy-of-giving component replacing u(C K ). In particular, the externality term remains exactly the same, and
exactly the same analysis as before goes through.
23

4.3

Accounting for inheritance received

The model considered so far involved two generations — parents and children only.
Kopczuk (2001) and Piketty and Saez (2012a,b) consider a different extension of the Mirrlees
model by allowing for both bequest decisions and heterogeneity in inheritance received by
those who make bequests themselves and imposing the steady state restriction that the
distribution of bequests received should be the same as that of bequests left. Kopczuk
(2001) makes the simplifying assumption of perfect correlation in skills across generation,
which implies that on the individual level bequest received and left should be the same.
There are important limitations of such an approach. In particular, it ignores the issue
of whether an economy can converge to the “optimal” allocation from an arbitrary initial
point. Very importantly, it also ignores welfare implications of the transition by placing
no weight on welfare of generations during the transition. For many questions such as, for
example, analyzing consumption vs income tax or pay-as-you-go Social Security systems,
the impact on the initial generation and transitional issues are of foremost importance and
the approach along these lines is not suitable. The focus on the long-term welfare is inherent
to this type of steady-state analysis, and simplifications that it introduces help in clarifying
implications of the dual role of inheritance (it is both given and received). Piketty and
Saez (2012a) argue that this kind of approach is more suitable for normative analysis. In
part, this is so by making it possible to abstract from the ability of government to go after
the initial wealth that plays an important role in the Judd-Chamley framework. Focusing
on the steady state makes it also more straightforward to express the results in terms of
empirically observable parameters.
The main result of Kopczuk (2001) may be seen by considering a special case of the more
general utility that he considers: the joy of giving formulation of the form u(C)+v(L)+g(B)
where C is consumption, L is labor supply, B is bequest left. Denoting by X the bequest
received, the budget constraint is of the form X + wL − T (B, wL) = C + RB.24 The
bequest received, X, is taken as given by an individual but the planner’s problem imposes
the steady state constraint that B = X for all individuals. Changing variables as D =
C − X, the individual problem may be expressed as u(D + X) + v(L) + g(B) subject to
wL − T (B, wL) = D + RB. In this (equivalent to the original one) formulation, B, L and D
are the choice variables and the externality acts through the utility rather than the budget
constraint.
As before, this is a modification of the Atkinson-Stiglitz setup with an externality from
bequests. However, contrary to the cases previously considered, the external effect has a
very specific form: its strength depends on the level of consumption. Absent externality, labor income tax would be sufficient here, because the Atkinson-Stiglitz separability
24

R is endogenized by considering constant returns to scale technology in aggregate bequests and aggregate
labor.

24

assumption holds. The targeting principle discussed previously calls for the corrective sub0

sidy of − Ru (X+D)
. Contrary to the two period model exemplified by the analysis of Farhi
µ
and Werning (2010), the Pigouvian tax rate is not just a function of X but rather it interacts with the level of consumption. For the same reason, X also interacts with incentive
constraints.25 It turns out that it is important: the optimal formula for estate taxation
includes three additive components: an aggregate term,26 Pigouvian correction (that can
be negative) andn a term proportional
to the product of the multiplier on the incentive cono
g 0 (B)
∂
straint and ∂X u0 (D+X) > 0 that gives rise to a positive contribution to the tax rate.
Kopczuk (2001) suggests that one way of thinking about it is that in the presence of an
externality from giving, bequests are a form of “income” that carries informational content
about individual skill level and therefore should be taxed. This is obviously a very stylized
model, in particular it ignores dynamics that is considered in the next section and instead
focuses on the question of the properties of a “golden rule” steady-state without accounting
for the transition to it. However, it allows for incorporating the dual role of bequests in a
very tractable way.
The key points so far are applicability of the Atkinson-Stiglitz logic to bequests and clarifying the role of externalities from giving. Externalities from giving tend to imply subsidies to
bequests, while the baseline Atkinson-Stiglitz case implies no tax on bequests. Combining
the two in the intergenerational context that does allow for the inheritance received to be
partially “exogenous” seems to point in the direction of estate taxation playing a role.
In two recent papers, Piketty and Saez (2012a,b) follow the approach of focusing on the welfare of a steady state generation to characterizing the optimal Mirleesian policy and further
stress the effect of receiving an inheritance. They consider a model that allows for imperfect
correlation of abilities across generations. In doing so, they relax the assumption of onedimensional differences between individuals that was made in the papers discussed so far.
They find the role for bequest taxation and argue that it is driven by multi-dimensionality
of the steady state distribution: both labor income and inheritances are (partially) independent sources of information about individual circumstances. In Piketty and Saez (2012b),
they consider multiple extensions that show robustness of their conclusions to relaxing the
focus on steady state.
A few extensions of this basic framework have been considered in the literature. Blumkin
and Sadka (2004) assume altruistic parents, introduce mortality risk and assume away the
25

Interestingly, all specifications considered by Farhi and Werning (2010) do not have this feature. They
consider a two period model with perfect correlation of skills so that the steady state interaction between
bequests received and left is not present. They also consider (discussed later) an infinite horizon model
with i.i.d. skills. In that case, the externality from giving is present and the steady state distributions of
bequests left and received have to coincide, but each bequest is distributed over the whole population so that

either.

In the presence of a positive externality from giving, there is an incentive to increase the flow of bequests

existence of annuity markets; they also allows for double-counting of children utility. They
analyze linear (income, capital and estate) taxation only. As discussed before, as long as the
estate tax declines with age at death, estate taxation provides insurance benefit and a small
estate tax is welfare improving (Kopczuk, 2003b). This is true in the model of Blumkin and
Sadka (2004). Bequests in their model are a mix of accidental and intentional and the estate
tax can be shown to decline with the strength of the bequest motive reflecting the trade-off
between distortions to intentional bequests and insurance benefit.27 They also consider
shutting down the altruism of parents in the model and investigate optimality of 100% tax
on purely accidental bequests and argue that it rests on the effect on aggregate labor supply
of the second generation: if (on the margin), revenue neutral reduction in the estate tax
coupled with an increase in the lump sum tax on the second generation results in higher
aggregate labor supply, the 100% tax need not be optimal. Note that the bequests are lumpsum income from the young generation’s point of view so that this exercise is effectively
about tweaking the distribution of lump-sum transfers to the young generation — the lumpsum tax adjustment is a uniform tax, while the impact of the estate tax adjustment varies
with the size and timing of accidental bequests. It is these distributional differences that
are key for the result. Blumkin and Sadka (2004) provide a numerical example in which the
effect is strong enough to make 100% estate tax not optimal. It remains unclear whether
this mechanism would survive in the nonlinear income tax context.
Farhi and Werning (2010) also consider a number of extensions of their basic framework.
Variation in the number of children requires the estate tax schedule to vary with the number
of children to restore the equivalence between inheritance and estate taxation. They also
consider imposing a non-negativeness restriction on the estate tax rate and allowing the
rate of return to be endogenous. In that case, they show that the positive estate tax rate
above a threshold is optimal: the intuition for this result is that reduction in bequests raises
the rate of return and this effect serves as a substitute for an explicit bequest subsidy.

4.4

Dynamic issues and relationship to optimal capital taxation

Taxation of wealth and bequests is a form of a tax on capital. In this section, I briefly review
the main results about capital income and wealth taxation in general. Models of capital
taxation in finite or infinite setting with altruistically linked individuals can usually be
interpreted as very simplified models of taxation of bequests, with each period corresponding
to a different generation. I do not review here work on capital taxation with overlapping
generations that are not explicitly linked by some form of bequest considerations or work on
capital income taxation that is explicitly within the lifetime (e.g., focusing on age-dependent
features).
27

This result is shown assuming logarithmic preferences

26

Literature on optimal capital income taxation in the long run is vast. Chari and Kehoe
(1999) provide an able survey of the older work on the topic that considered capital income
taxation in a growth framework with linear restrictions on available instruments and redistributive issues ignored.28 The key result (Chamley, 1986; Judd, 1985) is that the optimal
capital income tax rates (or, more generally, tax rates on any accumulated factors including
human capital, see Milesi-Ferretti and Roubini, 1998) should converge asymptotically to
zero. The intuition for this result is that any non-zero capital income tax imposes a distortion between consumption in different periods that is increasing with the distance and that
cannot be optimal. Atkeson et al. (1999) provide an excellent exposition of this argument.
Another key contribution is due to Aiyagari (1995) who introduced non-trivial heterogeneity.
He assumes that markets are incomplete and allows for uninsured idiosyncratic risk and
borrowing constraints. In this context, he showed that there is a role for capital income
taxation. The intuition for this result can be seen by considering the Euler equation for an
unconstrained individual:
u0 (Ci ) = ρ(1 + r(Ki ))E[u0 (Ci+1 )]

(12)

where r(Ki ) is the rate of return rate in period i, expressed as a function of the level of
capital stock.
In the ergodic steady state, the distribution of consumption in each period is the same.
Suppose then that we integrate equation (12) over the whole population: this would result
in the population expectation of u0 (C) on both sides and yield ρ(1 + r(Ki )) = 1 if that
expectation was finite. It cannot be finite however. To see it note that u0 (Ci ) = E[u0 (Ci+1 )]
implies u0 (Ci+1 ) = u0 (Ci ) + εi where εi+1 ⊥ u0 (Ci ) and E[ε2i+1 ] > 0, so that var(u0 (Ci+1 )) >
var(u0 (Ci )) which violates the ergodicity assumption. As Atkeson and Lucas (1992) demonstrate, efficiency in fact requires immiseration so that inequality is ever increasing and
E[u0 (Ci )] grows over time. By allowing for liquidity constraints, Aiyagari (1995) breaks the
Euler equation for some individuals:
u0 (Ci ) ≥ ρ(1 + r(Ki ))E[u0 (Ci+1 )]

(13)

with strict inequality for individuals whose borrowing is constrained. As the result, he
demonstrates that a stationary steady state exists but that it implies ρ(1 + r(Ki )) < 1
so that the rate of return is below and the capital stock is above the golden rule level.
Intuitively, precautionary saving motive acts to increase saving on the individual level and
leads to overaccumulation of capital and Aiyagari (1995) shows that positive capital income
tax is welfare improving.
28

This is referred to as Ramsey taxation — it builds on Ramsey growth model framework and is an
extension of the Ramsey commodity taxation problem.

27

Saez (2002a) introduces heterogeneity in the Ramsey model in a different way. He assumes that dynasties differ permanently with respect to their initial wealth (and assumes
away other heterogeneity) and considers the capital income tax that applies above a certain
threshold — mimicking the structure of the U.S. estate tax. He shows that the optimal
tax of that kind has a finite threshold under reasonable assumptions about the shape of
wealth distribution (sufficiently thick tail) and intertemporal elasticity that guarantee that
tax distortions are not too strong.29 Interestingly, a policy of this kind reduces wealth accumulation of high wealth holders to the threshold level but does not distort long-run capital
accumulation (Piketty, 2001) because asymptotically all remaining wealth is untaxed.
Work in this tradition has an important flaw: it imposes ad hoc restrictions on the set of
available tax instruments. Most obviously, linearity of capital income and labor income
taxation is unrealistic. More subtly, assumptions about tax treatment of initial resources,
government commitment and its ability to save play an important role.
The new dynamic public finance literature initiated by Golosov et al. (2003) seeks to remedy
the first concern by embedding dynamic capital income taxation questions in the Mirrleesian
framework. It considers individuals with unobserved and stochastically evolving ability.
One way of thinking about the standard Mirrlees model is that the undistorted allocation is
efficient but inequitable and the planner’s problem is to address such an inequity. Another
is to interpret income taxation as insurance against lifetime risk: such insurance does not
result in the full information first-best allocation because inability to observe state of the
world (individual skill type) generates the moral hazard problem (reduced effort). In a
way, there is a market failure in the standard Mirrleesian framework too — asymmetric
information does not allow for implementing the first-best lifetime insurance scheme — but
interpretation of this framework as insurance rather than redistribution is very stylized.
Some extensions of this framework as lifetime income insurance have been considered in the
literature (see e.g., Eaton and Rosen, 1980).
The new dynamic public finance literature adds to the picture dynamics so that incompleteness of insurance markets explicitly kicks in within the time frame of the model rather than
behind the veil of ignorance. The role of the policy is to insure, the cost is moral hazard
due to reduced incentives to exert costly effort in the presence of insurance. It turns out
that intertemporal distortions are required to mitigate that disincentive effect. The basic
result builds on insights of Diamond and Mirrlees (1978) and Rogerson (1985) and can be
illustrated as follows. Consider a single individual and two period model. Suppose that the
utility is additively separable in consumption and effort (e)

u(C0 ) + ρE[u(C1 ) − v(e)]
29

(14)

As in optimal income tax literature, raising marginal tax rates for high income population has mostly
inframarginal effect (Diamond, 1998; Saez, 2001) when the tail of the distribution is thick.

28

and that the overall resource constraint is given by (1 + r)C0 + E[C1 (θ)] = E[θe(θ)], where
the rate of return is given by r and neither effort e nor θ (state of the world, interpreted as
skills) are observable (though their product is). The person consumes in the two periods
and provides effort in the second period, however the return to effort is not observable.
The objective of policy is to provide insurance in the second period, while accounting for
disincentive effects.
The new dynamic public finance adopts the mechanism design approach to characterizing
Pareto efficient allocations by proposing schedules C1 (θ) and y(θ) = θe(θ). Suppose that
an individual chooses to report its type as θ0 . A change in reported type from θ0 to θ00
results in a change in utility from consumption by u(C1 (θ00 )) − u(C1 (θ0 )). The key result
can be derived by considering the following variation to the optimal policy. If we modify
the profile C1 to C̃1 so that utility in every state of the world changes by exactly the
df

same amount ε, u(C̃1 (θ)) = u(C1 (θ)) + ε, it will not change the report of the individual
because u(C1 (θ00 )) − u(C1 (θ0 )) = u(C̃1 (θ00 )) − u(C̃1 (θ0 )) for all θ0 and θ00 . In other words, the
incentive compatibility constraint is unaffected by such a modification: the gain in utility
from consumption due to a change in report is unaffected and hence there is no reason to
change the original level of effort (y(θ0 )/θ, where θ is the true type).
Put differently, we are considering a change in second period tax-and-transfer scheme that
results in no behavioral response — a uniform lump-sum adjustment would distort labor
supply decisions but a transfer combined with offsetting marginal rate adjustment can keep
it intact. Expressed explicitly in consumption terms, the necessary modification for small
values of ε is given by C̃1 (θ) − C1 (θ) =

ε
u0 (C1 (θ)) .

At the optimum, shifting consumption

from period 0 to period 1 in an incentive compatible way should have no impact on welfare
so that, accounting for the storage technology that allows for transferring consumption
between periods at the rate of 1 + r, implementing this variation implies

(15)

This is the inverse Euler equation formula. It represents a necessary condition for the
allocation to be Pareto efficient given incentive constraints — it was obtained by appealing
to a shift from consumption in period zero to consumption in period one in a way that
implies no resource cost and has no effect on relative utility comparisons between states
of the world in period 1 thereby leaving incentive constraints intact. This formula differs
subtly but importantly from the standard Euler equation (12), that can be written as
29

(1+r)ρ

(with equality if and only if there

is no uncertainty), so that the inverse Euler equation implies that consumption should be
distorted toward period 0. In particular, it implies that individuals should not be allowed
to invest at the rate r but rather should face a positive “wedge” between current and future
consumption, hence introducing a rationale for capital taxation.
The inverse Euler equation is a necessary condition for the constrained Pareto efficient allocation in a dynamic setting: it describes the optimal program in the presence of private
information. There is a trade-off between insurance and incentives to provide effort: provision of insurance (equalizing marginal utility across states) weakens incentives to provide
effort. The way to (partially) restore work incentives is to discourage saving.30 The lesson
carries over to multiple periods and infinite horizon settings with arbitrary data-generating
process for skills (Golosov et al., 2003).
Applied in the bequest context, the model would call for discouraging bequests in order
to stimulate effort of the younger generation — it seems (though it has not been seriously
explored) that the case for the importance of this channel should hinge on the empirical
effect of inheritance on labor supply of children. We will discuss such evidence in Section
5.4.
The implementation of the optimum turns out to be more complex than simply coming
up with the deterministic marginal capital income tax rate t that would make the solution
to the standard Euler equation governing individual choice

satisfy

the inverse Euler formula, equation (15). In the stochastic setting, there are in principle
more ways to impose the wedge because the tax rate may vary depending on the state in
the second period. In terms of implementation, it means that the tax rate on saving may
depend on (current and past) labor income and, in fact, it turns out that this is optimal.
One lesson from this line of work is that there are many ways to implement the optimal
allocation. Of course, this is also true without uncertainty and/or dynamics: for example,
Fullerton (1997) considers implications of various normalizations in the context of taxation
of externalities and large literature analyzes relationship between income and consumption
taxation (see e.g., Auerbach, 2009). The dynamic context allows for a rich set of instruments that includes current labor and capital income, assets, as well as history of these tax
bases. Uncertainty adds richness of interactions, so that the quest is for a “simple” and
realistic implementation. For example, Kocherlakota (2005) proposes an implementation
that has zero wealth tax rate on average, but that rate depends in general depends on the
history of labor income reports (the wealth tax in each state of the world can be linear
in wealth). Albanesi and Sleet (2006) propose an implementation that depends on current
assets and income only but it applies only in a setting with shocks that are i.i.d., i.e. it

The model builds in normality of second-period leisure via the assumption of additive separability.

rules out persistence of productivity over time. Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006) highlight the
importance of asset testing in the empirical implementation.
As discussed by Kocherlakota (2010) and Salanié (2011, chapter 6), the implementation
requires intertemporal distortion to be negatively correlated with the level of labor income
or, in other words, the marginal tax rate on capital or assets to decline with labor income.
This has two noteworthy implications for thinking about estate or wealth taxation. First,
the optimal taxes are non-trivially joint functions of income and assets, possibly involving
the full history of these variables. This is in contrast to the actual estate and gift taxation in
the United States that operates independently from income taxation. It is also in contrast
to the important types of capital taxation such as capital gains and (currently) dividend
tax that impose linear tax rates with relatively minor interactions with the rest of the tax
system. It is also in contrast to corporate taxation that, while complex and to some extent
nonlinear, does not account for other taxes paid by shareholders. Second, all proposed
implementations feature capital or wealth distortions that either explicitly or on average fall
with the current income/productivity.31 As the result, this line of work appears to provide
arguments for capital taxation at the bottom of the distribution — for example, asset
testing in the context of disability/welfare programs — rather than lessons for understanding
potential optimality of capital taxation at high income levels.
This vibrant literature delivers new and interesting insight but has remained somewhat stylized in its empirical applications. In particular, there were no attempts to express the results
in terms of empirically estimable quantities along the lines of Saez (2001) (in the context of
optimal income tax). This approach relies on the presence of private information but also
on individuals placing value on insurance. Indeed, trivially, there would be no inefficiency
due to the presence of private information and no role for taxation if individuals were risk
neutral. More subtly, the literature has not (yet?) attempted to carefully disentangle the
implications of uncertainty, risk attitudes and incentives for the shape of the optimal tax
schedule in this context. The absolute utility gains from insurance are high when marginal
utility is high so that the planner’s objective should be to deliver utility in those case and,
by the logic of the inverse Euler equation, distort accumulation decisions in situations that
are correlated with experiencing high marginal utility. In the contexts considered by the
new dynamic public finance literature, this implies little role for distorting intertemporal
margin in states of the world that correspond to experiencing low marginal utility from
consumption. As the result, as of now, this literature provides little constructive insight for
thinking about tax policy toward the top of the distribution.
31
The exception is a recent paper by Werning (2011) that proposes an implementation that features
history-dependent labor taxation and savings tax that is independent of the current shock (though historydependent, although sufficient conditions for history independence are discussed). The unique feature of this
implementation is that savings are always set at zero and the role of the savings tax is to implement that
as an optimum with transfer of resources across periods taking instead the form of adjustments to the labor
income tax schedule.

31

The only contribution in the new dynamic public finance that explicitly incorporates bequests is again Farhi and Werning (2010) who consider an infinite horizon version of their
model basic model with the externality from giving, allowing for abilities uncorrelated across
generations. They show that the presence of the giving externality modifies the inverse elasticity rule familiar from this literature precisely by the additive component reflecting the
externality as before. Adapting the implementation of the optimal allocation in terms of
linear (but history dependent) taxes on inherited wealth as in Kocherlakota (2005), they
show that the average inheritance tax rate (that would be zero absent externality from
giving) has exactly the same structure as given in equation (10) thereby preserving their
conclusions about negativity and “progressivity.”

Behavioral responses to transfer taxation

Empirical work on effects of estate taxation on taxpayers’ decisions is marred with practical
difficulties. On the conceptual side, the question is how to identify the effect of the tax that
will apply at the time of death — which is uncertain and, in expectations, many years away
— on current behavior. Alternatively, one might wonder how what is observed at the time
of death might have been impacted by tax policy regime(s) earlier in life. Potentially long
lag between behavioral response and the ultimate taxation,32 makes it difficult to credibly
establish the causal link between estate taxation and behavior. Still, certain aspects of
taxpayer behavior can be studied over shorter-term. In particular, studying the effect of
gift taxation and behavior very late in life can be more conclusively related to tax incentives.
The second important issue has to do with availability of data. With some exceptions,
estate tax returns are not public information and, because the estate tax applies to high
net worth population, standard surveys that do not focus on high net worth population
are of limited use. Surveys that oversample high net worth population (such as Survey of
Consumer Finance), probate records and administrative datasets are potential sources of
data.
Despite these difficulties, the literature has made some strides into understanding the impact
of transfer taxation on behavior.
Perhaps the most basic question is about the effect of estate taxation on wealth accumulation. The simplest approach is to consider a certainty framework that ignores dynamic dimension, with individual maximizing utility u(C, L, B) subject to the constraint
C + RB = y − T (E), where E = wL − C is the size of the estate. Following the approach
of Feldstein (1995, 1999), the literature on responsiveness to income taxation (recently surveyed by Saez et al., 2012) focused on the “sufficient statistic” for behavioral response —
32

In one of the most famous examples of effective estate tax planning, Sam Walton set up a family limited
partnership that allowed for great majority of his estate to pass tax free to his wife and children in 1953, 39
years before his death.

32

the responsiveness of taxable income. A similar sufficient statistic argument can be applied
in the estate tax context. While the estate tax can affect behavior on many possible margins
(even in this simple formulation, labor supply and bequests may both respond), the welfare
impact of the estate tax should be summarized by the impact of the tax on taxable base
— in this case, the size of the estate. This would be so even when we add other margins
of response such as, for example, tax avoidance. This argument relies on considering a
small change in the marginal estate tax rate dt above some threshold Ē (so that the tax is
T (E) + dt · (E − Ē)). By the envelope theorem, the effect of that change on the overall level
of utility is −uC · (E − Ē) · dt, while the impact on revenue reflects the effect of a change
in the tax rate on the size of estate: T 0 (E) · dE + dt · (E − Ē). In either case, it is the
level and responsiveness of the overall estate rather than the composition of the response
that matters. Hence, by extension, focusing on the effect of estate taxation on the size of
estate at the time of death is a natural starting point for understanding the efficiency cost
of estate taxation.
It is obvious that this simple framework misses a lot of things. Comprehensively applying
Feldstein’s argument requires understanding the effect on overall tax liability. Even within
the simplest framework, it calls for estimating the effect not just on estates but also on
gifts, as well as that on another main source of tax revenue — income taxation. Reducing
labor supply is one obvious margin that the donor can respond on but by far not the only
one. Investment decisions and occupational choice might respond to taxation and have
implications for income and corporate tax base. Delaying capital gains realization due to
step-up in basis at death reduces capital gains tax revenue. Taxpayers who might respond
to the estate tax by increasing their charitable contributions, might do so via giving in life
with income tax consequences. Avoidance strategies that rely on freezing the value of estate
and transferring ownership to beneficiaries might shift taxable income (not just estate) to
other individuals. The natural margins of interest for understanding tax consequences of
changes in transfer taxation are responsiveness of inter vivos gifts, and life-time taxes such
as due to the impact on income, capital gains or corporate tax base. Response of transfers
also naturally has implications for behavior and tax liabilities of beneficiaries.
Similarly as in the case of taxable income, focusing on the tax base has limitations. In the
presence of tax evasion or other situations where revenue or welfare spillovers are present,
decomposing the response into “real” and “shifting” component is important as pointed out
by Slemrod (1998) and elaborated by Chetty (2009). Additionally, response of the tax base
to tax incentives is informative about implications of narrow reforms modifying tax rate
structure but not about implications of reforms that might affect the base or other non-rate
aspects of the system that may themselves affect the magnitude of the behavioral response
(Slemrod and Kopczuk, 2002). Last, but certainly not least, the effect of taxation on real
quantities is the relevant parameter to know for many non-tax related questions.
In what follows, I review empirical evidence on major types of responses to transfer taxation,
33

but begin with clarifying magnitude of distortions that are caused by such taxation.

5.1

Magnitude of distortions

Taxes on transfers are related to other forms of taxation. Most obviously, a tax on estates
or bequests is a form of a tax on wealth. To see that, consider first the following asset
accumulation equation:
Ak+1 = (1 − tw )(1 + (1 − tk )r) (Ak + Sk )

(16)

where Ak represents assets in period k, tw is an annual wealth tax, tk is a tax imposed on
return to savings, r is in the interest rate and Sk is net new saving as of the end of period
k. I am going to assuming that Ai ≥ 0 for all i.
In the event of death at the beginning of period t + 1, after tax bequests are given by
Bk+1 = (1 − t)Ak+1 . Iterating equation 16, yields

Bk+1 = (1 − t) R

k+1

where

R = (1 − tw )(1 + (1 − tk )r)

(17)

i=0

Assuming first no saving, Si = 0 for all i, the tax on estate is equivalent to an annual
wealth tax given by 1 − tw = (1 − t)1/(k+1) . For example, assuming k + 1 = 50 and
t = 0.35 implies tw = 0.0086: obviously, the longer the horizon the lower the equivalent
wealth tax. Similarly, there is equivalence here between capital income tax and the estate
tax: 1 + (1 − tk )r = (1 + r)(1 − t)1/(k+1) . Again, as an example, additionally assuming
5% rate of return, one obtains tk = 0.18. It is straightforward to show that the equivalent
capital income tax rate is a decreasing function of the rate of return: the return on the
taxed amount does not accrue to the taxpayer and this effect is more important when the
rate of return is higher.
Adding saving to the picture complicates the analysis: the equivalent (resulting in the same
bequest holding behavior constant) wealth or capital income tax rate depends on when
saving takes place — the shorter the horizon, the lower the rates. The main point here is
that the horizon and rate of return matter: the estate tax is an infrequent tax so that it
is mechanically less burdensome (as measured by equivalent tax rates) relative to annual
taxes as horizon increases and it provides a deferral advantage that grows with the horizon
and the rate of return.
This discussion illustrates how one might compare the effective tax rate under the estate
tax to that under other types of capital taxation, but it does not appropriately describe the

34

distortion induced by the tax. As one example, the 35% estate tax rate from the example
above has different incentive effects than annual capital income tax rate of 18%: holding
bequest constant, estate tax does not distort lifetime consumption profile while capital
income tax does.
Evaluating the marginal estate tax rate that applies at the time of death is a reasonably welldefined exercise although even that is not always straightforward. The actual tax liability
is affected by many factors including reliance on marital and other types of deductions,
valuation discounts, interaction with state taxation and deferred payment schedule among
other things.33 We will delay talking about such complications until reviewing related
empirical papers.
The actual marginal tax rate at the time of death is directly relevant for decisions that take
place around that time — deathbed estate tax planning or choices made by the executor of
the estate. However, decision of the donor earlier in life should be governed by expectations
of the estate tax rate at the time of death rather than its actual value.
Poterba (2000b) asks how the marginal investment decisions are affected by the presence of
estate taxation. He points out that saving rate of return between period i and i + 1 is not
affected by the presence of the estate tax if there is no mortality risk. Denoting mortality
rate by mi , the expected rate of return is given by (1 − mi )(1 + (1 − tk )r) + mi (1 − t)(1 +
(1 − tk )r) = (1 − mi t)(1 + (1 − tk )r): on the margin, the estate tax is equivalent to a wealth
tax at the rate of mi t. Equivalently, the rate of return is 1 + (1 − tk )r − mi t(1 + (1 − tk )r).
Closer inspection of this formula reveals that the effect of the estate tax on the marginal
rate of return increases with mortality rate, but otherwise is not very sensitive to the rate
of return because 1 + (1 − tk )r ≈ 1. The estate tax is relatively more important than capital
income taxation when the rate of return is low and less important when the rate of return
is high.
Note though that this is marginal analysis that applies to investments over short horizon.
Suppose that the taxpayer is saving with the purpose of leaving a bequest. In that case, as
the first pass, mortality risk does not matter. To see it, consider period N that is sufficiently
distant to guarantee that a taxpayer dies by then. The future value of a marginal dollar
of current saving as of period N is given by (1 − t)(1 + r(1 − tk ))N : regardless of the
timing of death, the estate tax will be paid once before period N . As long as the marginal
increase in tax liability is neutral with respect to the timing of death and the utility from
bequest is not a function of age at death, the mortality risk should not enter. Neither of
these are assumptions is automatic: the timing of capital gains step-up matters and welfare
neutrality of the timing of bequests would depend on the presence of liquidity constraints
and precise assumptions about the nature of the bequest motive. Ultimately, the extent
33

The estate tax liability attributable to a qualified business may be eligible for payment in installments
over a 10 year period.

35

to which mortality risk interacts with estate taxation is an empirical (and, as of now,
unresolved) question.
Saving/investment decision is just one of the many margins that may be distorted by the
estate tax. In particular, taxpayers might choose to make transfers in life instead of making
them at death. This has nuanced tax consequences under the U.S. (and other countries’)
tax law. Marginal tax rates applying to gifts and estates are usually different. Denote the
gift tax rate by tG and continue to denote the estate tax rate as t. For simplicity of the
exposition, I assume here that they are applied to the same base — the total amount of
the transfer. Let’s continue to assume that taxpayers are interested in maximizing the total
after tax amount of transfers. In the certainty, one shot context, one should select the mode
of transfer that corresponds to the lower marginal tax rate. In practice, usually tG < t,34
so that there is a presumption that gifts are advantageous. Now consider the same decision
but instead assume that the transfer at death will take place n years from now (for now
assumed certain) and the asset accumulates at the rate of return r.35 Denoting by G is the
value of the transfer considered, the value of tax at period n is (1 + r)n tG G or (1 + r)n tG
so that the comparison is unchanged.
However, in practice, the tax schedule is often nonlinear. Using T and T G to represent

and B G are bases for gift and estate tax, respectively. A gift changes the base for the
gift tax by its pre-accumulation value while it changes the base for the estate tax by its
(higher) after-accumulation value. The effect will depend on the relationship between the
two schedules, but in practice it is likely to make gift taxation further preferred when the
two schedules are closely related and the nominal rate of return is high or the horizon is
long. In particular, in the U.S. case, B E and B G are (imperfectly) tied to each other via
unified credit (lifetime exemption). Ignoring for simplicity the difference in how gift and
estate tax is calculated and writing
the tax as a single

made to (1 + r)n T 0 B E + B G + (1 + r)n G when it is delayed until death, providing the
strong case for pre-paying the estate tax via gift taxation as long as the marginal tax rate
increases with the base without even appealing to the difference in statutory marginal tax
rate schedules. The key point here is that early gifts remove future appreciation from the
tax base and this effect is beneficial in the presence of progressivity. The effect is especially
strong when assets are expected to appreciate (even if just in nominal terms) or horizon is
long.
Another wrinkle influencing the choice between gifts and bequests relates to tax treatment
34

In the U.S., gifts are taxed on tax exclusive basis that implies lower marginal tax rate; see footnote 39.
This assumption is not necessarily correct — it is possible that the donor may have access to different
investment opportunities than the donee.
35

36

of capital gains. Suppose that fraction β of the asset to be transferred corresponds to
appreciated taxable gain to be taxed at realization at some rate tK (assume that this is the
rate that accounts for the benefits of the deferral). In the U.S., capital gains transferred
at death benefit from step-up in basis but gifts do not. Hence, the cost consequences of
the bequest are unaffected by this modification but those of the gift are. The tax basis of
an asset is adjusted for gift taxes paid that are attributable to the capital gains liability so
that there is an incremental tax liability of (β − βtG )tK . One can go further by modeling
benefits of deferral and implications of various liquidation strategies. There are additional
complications in case of gifts shortly (3 years) before death that may be treated as bequests
and further opportunities to benefit from step up by first transferring the asset to a surviving
spouse. See Joulfaian (2005a) for further discussion and illustrative calculations. Another
aspect that has not been accounted for here are differences in marginal tax rates of donors
and donees that create additional opportunities for tax arbitrage (Stiglitz, 1985; Agell and
Persson, 2000). It has been argued that it has important implications in the context of the
estate tax (Bernheim, 1987).

5.2

Effect on wealth accumulation and reported estates

A number of papers attempted to relate estate taxation to wealth or estates at death.
Kopczuk and Slemrod (2001) use estate tax returns covering selected years between 1916
and 1996.36 They first pursue aggregate and micro-based analysis using aggregate timeseries variation in top marginal tax rate and marginal tax rates evaluated at 40 or 100
times average wealth as instruments for the individual marginal tax rate at death. This
is not a particularly convincing identification strategy and, unsurprisingly, the results are
not particularly robust. They subsequently attempt to exploit cross-sectional variation. To
do so, they note that it is expected taxation over individual lifetime that should matter
and they propose using the imputed marginal tax rate at age 45 as a proxy (instrumented
using tax rates at the fixed point of the distribution as before). This approach introduces
variation in the marginal tax rate at any particular point in time that is driven by variation
in age of decedents, and this variable turns out to dominate other measures of tax burden
in “horse-race” specifications. This strategy yields significant net-of-tax elasticity of net
worth at death of about 0.16.
Holtz-Eakin and Marples (2001) use Health and Retirement Survey to estimate the effect
of estate taxation on wealth of the living population. They primarily rely on cross-sectional
variation in state inheritance and estate tax rates to identify the effect. In principle, this
could be a more credible source of variation than age-variation considered by Kopczuk and
Slemrod (2001) and focusing on the living individuals allows for interpreting the results as
36

The IRS has complete micro data for period 1916-1945 and samples for 1962, 1965, 1969, 1972, 1976
and annually starting from 1982 (though with varying coverage and design). See McCubbin (1994) for a
description of the pre-1945 data and Johnson (1994) for the discussion of post-1982 datasets.

37

the response to estate taxation expected in the future (under the assumption that current
rates are a good proxy for future tax rates). However, the HRS data contains few high
net worth individuals, and cross-sectional variation may not deal adequately with locationbased heterogeneity and endogeneity of location decisions. Joulfaian (2006b) pursues a
systematic attempt to exploit time variation to explain the size of estates. Rather than
using marginal tax rates at death, he uses an (“representative”) equivalent marginal tax
rate 10 years before death. That rate is constructed using a stylized procedure that follows
the insight of Poterba (2000b): that rate is obtained by solving for tk the equation given
by (1 + r)n (1 − t) = (1 + r(1 − tk ))n , where t is the tax rate that applies 10 years before
death, r is linked to the growth rate of S&P 500 and constant life-expectancy of n = 15 or
n = 20 years is assumed.
As can be inferred from this brief summary, as of yet, the literature has not been able to
come up with a fully convincing empirical strategy to estimate this key dimension of the
response. It is worth noting though that all these papers estimate similar baseline elasticity
of net worth/reported estate estimates with respect to the net-of-tax rate of between 0.1
and 0.2.37 The baseline specifications in each case attempt to shed a light on the response
to incentives over the lifetime (rather than marginal tax rates at death), but use different
dependent variables: in Holtz-Eakin and Marples (2001) it is wealth at some point while
alive measured in survey data, while the other two papers focus on estate at death as
reported on tax returns. Taken at face value, these results would be consistent with the
notion that tax avoidance is not the main driver of the response, the topic to which we will
return below.38

5.3

Inter vivos giving

In contrast to the work on responsiveness of wealth and estates, the literature has made
more significant strides in estimating the effect of taxation on giving while alive. The U.S.
and many other countries tax gifts and estates in ways that create opportunities for tax
avoidance (see Nordblom and Ohlsson, 2006, for a theoretical analysis). In the U.S., estate
and gift taxes have operated completely independently since 1932 (when the gift tax was
introduced) until 1976. Since 1977, gift and estate taxation have been integrated, that is
gifts reduce the size of exemption available at the time of death. Since the very beginning,
the gift tax applies to lifetime gifts, that is gifts made in the past are accumulated to provide
a lifetime basis. Also, since the beginning of its existence, the gift tax rates have been lower
than estate tax rates: explicitly initially and through the distinction between tax-inclusive
37

Both Holtz-Eakin and Marples (2001) and Joulfaian (2006b) do not estimate the elasticity directly
but discuss converting their estimates to those obtained from the “standard” log-log specification used by
Kopczuk and Slemrod (2001).
38
In a very recent paper, Seim (2012) finds evidence of significant responses of reported wealth to marginal
tax rate incentives under the Swedish annual wealth tax that he attributes to tax evasion.

38

and tax-exclusive basis since.39 Gift taxation allows for annual exemptions40 and interacts
in non-trivial way with step-up in basis at death. The final component of the system in
the United States is the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax that’s imposed on transfers that
skip a generation.41 See Joulfaian (2004) for the history of changes in gift tax provisions.
The tax advantaged nature of gifts usually provides an incentive to transfer inter vivos
rather than at death. This incentive is particularly strong in the case of assets that are
expected to appreciate. On the other hand, gifts generally do not benefit from the step up
in basis and hence may trigger capital gains tax liability.
Joulfaian (2004) focuses on aggregate gift tax revenue and documents massive spikes corresponding to changes in gift tax rates. In particular, gifts in 1976 — in anticipation of
integration of gifts and estates and, simultaneously, an increase in the top gift rate from
57.5% to 70% — quadrupled compared to the previous year, only to decline to well below
pre-1976 levels for another decade or so. This is further supported by more formal aggregate time-series econometric specifications that convert striking salient features of the time
series into large and very significant estimates of elasticity to current and anticipated tax
rates. The aggregate evidence strongly indicates that some (presumably large) gifts are
very responsive. Ohlsson (2011) documents similar dynamics in Sweden in 1948 just before
Sweden instituted a temporary estate tax on top of existing inheritance and gift taxation.
Bernheim et al. (2004) provide micro-based evidence. They use data from the Survey of
Consumer Finances between 1989 and 2001 and focus on the impact of increases in estate tax
exemption. The increase should have no effect on people who never expected to be above
the exemption, it should discourage gifts for those who are phased out of the tax reach
and it could possibly increase gifts for very high net worth individuals via wealth effect.42
They crudely classify individuals into groups that may fall into each category based on
their current net worth and do find patterns of gift-giving that are very supportive of the
presence of response: gifts for the middle category decline relative to other while gifts for
the top category (insignificantly) increase. Page (2003) relies on cross-sectional variation in
state estate tax rates and shows relationship between marginal tax rates and the size of gifts
in the SCF. Joulfaian (2005a) revisits the same question but focuses more carefully on the
role of capital gains taxation. The capital gains tax applies to gifts but not to estates that
benefit from the step up at death. This matters more when appreciated assets constitute a
The estate tax applies on the tax inclusive basis, so that a dollar of estate yields the tax liability of T 0
and the gift of 1 − T 0 . The gift tax applies on the tax exclusive basis so that the gift of a dollar entails

41
In particular, it applies to related individuals who are more than one generation apart (such as grandchildren) and to unrelated parties that are younger by 37.5 or more years.
42
There were other changes, such as the decline in the capital gains rate, that may have increased the
advantage of making gifts by taxable individuals. They argue that the effect is likely small and otherwise
would work against finding an effect for the most interesting middle group.

large part of the estate and when the planning horizon is short. He shows the magnitude of
this effect and demonstrates that the advantage of gifts over estates is not universal. Using
the relative tax price that accounts for the capital gains considerations and relying on state
tax variation, he also finds that gifts are responsive to tax considerations. Arrondel and
Laferrère (2001) also document that gifts in France responded to major changes in fiscal
incentives.
A number of papers (McGarry, 2000; Poterba, 2001; McGarry, 2001; Joulfaian and McGarry, 2004) focused on a different outcome: reliance of taxpayers on the annual gift tax
exclusion. This is estate tax planning 101: taxpayers are allowed to transfer tax free up
to $13,000 (in 2011) per donee annually, to as many people as they wish. For example,
a married couple with two children can make four such transfers every year (each spouse
can make a gift to each child) so that, let’s say over 20 year horizon, they could transfer
over $1 million tax free (even before adjusting for the rate of return). Before 2000, which is
the period that these studies used, the exclusion was $10,000 and the estate tax threshold
$600,000 so that the potential for reliance on this strategy to effectively eliminate tax liability for many otherwise taxable taxpayers was very high. Even with higher exemptions,
this continues to be the basic planning strategy. Yet, the key finding in these studies is that
this strategy is significantly underutilized by potential estate taxpayers.43 Poterba (2001)
concludes that the results imply that taxpayers fail to minimize tax liability.44
Joulfaian and McGarry (2004) report, based on linked estate and gift tax data for 1992
decedents, that relatively few (1/3) ultimate estate taxpayers make taxable gifts over their
lifetime and that such gifts are infrequent; ultimately the volume of lifetime taxable gifts is
of the order of 10% of the estate.
Hence, the literature does find that gifts are very responsive to tax considerations but it
also finds that, despite responsiveness, gifts appear to be significantly underutilized as a tax
planning tool. These patterns are consistent with previously mentioned results of Kopczuk
(2007) who concluded that avoidance is particularly pronounced shortly before death and,
when coupled with robustly increasing wealth profiles, it reveals that tax minimization is
not by itself a complete description of the objective of estate tax payers. As the result,
evidence on gift-giving is consistent with the notion stressed previously in this chapter that
some motive going beyond consumption value for holding on to wealth until late in life is
necessary. I will return to this theme in Section 6.1.
43

Poterba (2001) uses SCF that oversamples high net-worth population and shows that relatively weak gift
giving strategy extends to individuals with net worth several times the exemption limit. McGarry (2000,
2001) relies on HRS/AHEAD data that focuses on elderly population and reaches similar conclusion for
elderly households that are on average closer to the estate threshold than the SCF sample.
44
This is in contrast to predictions from a stylized frictionless model that has been used as a benchmark elsewhere in the literature. A small literature considered that question previously using aggregate
information and illustrative marginal tax rate calculations (Adams, 1978; Kuehlwein, 1994).

5.4

Labor supply of recipients

A number of papers have considered the effect of receiving inheritance on labor supply
of recipients. This is one of the important dimensions necessary for understanding the
efficiency cost of transfer taxation. It is of relevance because it represents an incentive
effect and has revenue consequences: one needs to be able to trace the effect of changes in
the tax on all sources of revenue in order to understand its efficiency cost. It is also the
response that is potentially linked to externalities from bequests.
At its simplest form, inheritance is the type of exogenous, non-wage, income for the donee.
Express the utility of the donee as uK (C, L) and the budget constraint as C = y+B(t)+wL,
where B(t) is the bequest received given donor’s tax rate t and y represents income from
other exogenous sources. Labor supply may be written as L(w, y + B(t)), making it clear
that when B is taken as given by the donee, the receipt of inheritance should generate
income effect response of labor supply. Under the standard assumption that leisure is a
normal good, receiving inheritance should then lead to a reduction in labor supply.
An increase in the estate tax should (other things constant) generate a response in labor
supply proportional to the effect that the tax has on the size of inheritance. In this simple
framework, knowledge of the effect of taxation on the size of inheritance (B 0 (t)) and an
estimate of the income effect on labor supply coming from elsewhere would be sufficient for
evaluating the effect of taxation on labor supply of the donees. As we have seen though,
estimating the effect of taxation on inheritance is not trivial (and credible direct estimates of
income elasticity of labor supply are not abound either). Furthermore, this simple reasoning
requires at least three important qualifications.
First, the assumption that inheritance is “exogenous” need not be correct. In particular,
the basic prediction of the altruistic model is that the size of inheritance should respond to
individual characteristics. In that case, using the simple labor supply framework as before,
the bequest itself should be a function of individual characteristics such as the recipients’
wage rate, B(t, w). When this is the case, simply regressing donee’s labor supply on the
size of inheritance is not necessarily informative about tax implications because bequests
are correlated with individual characteristics. Tax induced variation remains necessary for
the purpose of identifying the labor supply response.
The second qualification to the basic view of inheritance as an exogenous income effect is
that bequests are not unexpected (although their timing often might be). Individuals who
anticipate a bequest may respond before the actual receipt of inheritance, making it difficult
to estimate the effect of inheritance itself. Additionally, a natural concern is the potential
presence of strategic interactions. When that is the case, bequests and labor supply of the
donee are jointly determined. In particular, labor supply may be affected by characteristics
of the donor beyond the size of the bequest itself. The natural way of considering this issue is

41

to do so in the context of a dynamic framework along the lines considered in the Samaritan’s
dilemma (Bruce and Waldman, 1991; Coate, 1995) results that break Becker’s “rotten kid”
theorem (Becker, 1974; Bruce and Waldman, 1990; Bergstrom, 2008).45 Casting it in an
empirical framework, labor supply may be written as L(w, wP , y + B(t, w, wP )), where wP
is the strategic effect of wage (or other characteristics) of the parent and it is assumed that
upon the receipt of inheritance the source of income does not matter. Considering strategic
considerations further complicates interpretation of any estimated effect of inheritance, but
variation in tax incentives remains a natural source of identification and the reduced form
effect of tax on labor supply is in principle the parameter of interest for understanding
revenue consequences. However, since the behavior of a family can no longer be assumed
to be efficient, understanding the strength of strategic interactions is of relevance too for
thinking about policy implications.
Thirdly, the effect of inheritance may vary with characteristics and circumstances of the
recipient. In particular, potential presence of liquidity constraints is of natural interest for
thinking about implications of taxation, because in that case estate taxation interacts with
other market imperfections.46
Holtz-Eakin et al. (1993) framed the question about the effect of inheritance on labor supply
as “Carnegie conjecture.” Famously, Andrew Carnegie suggested that inheritance makes
donees less productive members of society. Anecdotal evidence abound of course and labor
supply is not the only margin that may be considered as being “less productive,” but it
is certainly one with important economic consequences.47 Holtz-Eakin et al. (1993) used
information from income tax returns of inheritance recipients to study the effect on their
labor force participation and earnings and found robust negative effect on participation and
some evidence suggesting earnings declines. Joulfaian and Wilhelm (1994) study the same
question using PSID and find smaller participation responses in that sample.
Brown et al. (2010) focus on an older population using Health and Retirement Survey. This
older sample is more likely to receive inheritance than the general public. The nature of
this sample allows them to focus on retirement decision rather than hours response — this
is important, because evidence suggests that labor supply responses are much stronger on
the extensive margin in general and on retirement in particular. Importantly, HRS includes
questions about expected inheritance and, by relying on the first wave of the survey, they
45

The “rotten kid” results clarify conditions under which a benevolent household head can use transfers to
guarantee that self-interested household members will act to maximize family income/utility. See Bergstrom
(2008) for discussion. In particular, when parents cannot commit not to help their children in the future
(“Samaritan’s dilemma”), it creates a strategic incentive for children to take actions that will increase such
transfers (such as overconsumption/underinvesting) and may lead to an inefficient allocation for the family
as a whole.
46
Presumably by aggravating them, although recall the result of Aiyagari (1995) that calls for capital
taxation in the presence of liquidity constraints due to general equilibrium implications of “excessive” precautionary saving.
47
A conceptually different but fascinating channel that wealthy parents invest in preference for leisure for
their children has been analyzed theoretically by Doepke and Zilibotti (2008)

42

construct measures of whether the inheritance was expected and how its actual size compares
to prior expectations. They confirm the finding of negative participation effect and further
show that the effect is stronger for unexpected inheritances.48
Elinder et al. (2011) use Swedish tax register data and confirm that the receipt of inheritance
reduces labor income (they do not decompose the response into extensive and intensive
margins).49 They also find a short-lived increase in capital income, possibly suggesting
temporary consumption increases. This is also consistent with findings of Joulfaian and
Wilhelm (1994) who document small consumption increases following receipt of inheritance
and Joulfaian (2006a) who documents that wealth responds much less than one for one to
the receipt of inheritance.
There are other estimates of the effect of unearned income on labor supply and consumption,
using variation in lottery winnings (Imbens et al., 2001; Kuhn et al., 2011) and stock market
wealth (e.g., Poterba, 2000a; Coile and Levine, 2006), although the results do not paint fully
consistent picture. As discussed before, their applicability in the context of bequests requires
the strong assumption of inheritance being equivalent to exogenous income so that direct
studies of the impact of inheritance remain of independent interest (and they can be also
viewed as identifying the effect of an unearned income shock). The literature on the effect
of wealth shocks has provided evidence suggestive of negative effects on labor supply of
donors, though much remains to be done. None of this work has provided evidence derived
from tax variation so that the tax policy relevant effect — the impact of the transfer tax
on labor supply of the donee that requires accounting for the effect of the tax on the size
of inheritance — has not yet been carefully studied.

5.5

Entrepreneurship, family firms and inherited control

Going beyond simple labor supply responses, Holtz-Eakin et al. (1994a,b) focus on the effect
of inheritance receipt on entrepreneurship and survival of existing small businesses. They
find that inheritance matters for both and conclude that liquidity constraints are important.
This suggests that the impact of taxation on behavior of the next generation may be substantially more nuanced than negative labor supply effects would suggest. If negative labor
supply effects reflect the presence of liquidity constraints, welfare implications of increasing
estate taxation would need to account for exacerbating the distortion on this margin. Additionally, positive effects on entrepreneurship may not have immediate revenue consequences
so that estimates of short-term revenue impact may not be informative about longer term
effects. Evidence on the link between inheritance and lifting liquidity constraints is mixed.
48

They also argue that the effect is not driven by grieving — the labor supply estimate is unaffected by
inclusion of the dummy for death of one’s parent (rather than the parent of the spouse).
49
They provide weak evidence of potential anticipation effect. This is not necessarily evidence of a strategic
response though: reduction in labor supply prior to inheritance receipt may be due to devoting time to taking
care of an ill family member.

43

Tsoutsoura (2011) uses 2002 repeal of inheritance taxation in Greece to show the positive
effect of the tax on investment in transferred firms and provides some evidence consistent
with the importance of financial constraints in driving this effect. Hurst and Lusardi (2004)
show that both past and future inheritances predict entrepreneurship suggesting that they
may capture either anticipation effects (inconsistent with liquidity constraints) or other
factors correlated with both entrepreneurship and inheritance such as preferences or habits
(Charles and Hurst, 2003).
While recipients of inheritance may set up a new business, continuing a family firm is
another possible and common outcome. It is popularly claimed that forcing beneficiaries
to sell a business is an undesirable effect of estate taxation. The economic evidence on this
topic is much less clear: a number of papers found that inheritance of control in family
firms reduces performance (Pérez-González, 2006; Villalonga and Amit, 2006; Bloom and
Van Reenen, 2007).50 Evidence on whether the estate tax has any effect on transfer of
control is scarce. Brunetti (2006) uses probate records from San Francisco in 1980-1982 in
order to study the effect of reduction in federal and state estate tax rates on the likelihood
that decedent’s business is sold and finds small positive effects of the tax on the likelihood
of selling a business. The results are based on a small sample and variety of imperfect
diff-in-diff strategies, but are intriguing. However, if this effect is there and is undesirable,
entrepreneurs should pursue strategies to reduce the likelihood that the business will have
to be sold. Holtz-Eakin et al. (2001) study life insurance purchases of entrepreneurs and
conclude that they do not take full advantage of opportunities to protect their firms from
being sold in order to meet the estate tax liability.

Tax avoidance responses

6.1

Trade-off between tax minimization and control

The discussion so far made no serious distinction between responses that involve “real”
behavior — wealth accumulation, labor supply, lifetime transfers — and those that are
solely intended to reduce tax liability with no real consequences.
As usual in tax-related contexts, drawing a line between “real” and “avoidance” responses
is difficult. Consider for example an extreme type of response that has been discussed in the
literature: Kopczuk and Slemrod (2003a) show that during two weeks before/after major
estate tax changes, the likelihood of dying in the low tax regime is positively correlated
with the magnitude of tax savings; Gans and Leigh (2006) and Eliason and Ohlsson (2008)
50

Grossmann and Strulik (2010) analyze theoretically whether family firms should face preferential transfer
tax treatment. The trade-off they consider is between the cost of firm dissolution and lower management
quality. In their model, preferential taxation can induce a pooling equilibrium in which low ability children
(inefficiently) continue a firm.

44

show similar evidence surrounding the repeals of transfer taxes in Australia and Sweden
respectively. The response may be real — the will to live may be strengthened by the
benefits to one’s beneficiaries (or dislike of the government). Another possible explanation
is tax evasion — perhaps death certificate can be forged (possibly more likely with pre1945 reforms studied by Kopczuk and Slemrod, 2003a, than in recent years in Australia or
Sweden). The response may also be due to avoidance: there may be some control over the
timing of disconnecting life support. Sorting out these possibilities is very hard in practice.
It does not require much convincing that estate tax planning does take place in practice
and taxpayers are in fact interested in reducing their tax liability — the existence of estate
tax planning industry is a prima facie evidence of that. How effective can tax planning be?
In a very influential paper, Cooper (1979) dubbed the estate tax a “voluntary tax.” His
argument was that with sufficient planning, taxpayers can significantly reduce and perhaps
even eliminate tax liability. Some of the strategies he described are no longer available but
estate tax planning remains an active arena. The extent of tax avoidance is controversial
and naturally hard to estimate.
Schmalbeck (2001) argues that the “voluntary” nature of the estate tax ignores an important
consequence of all strategies identified by Cooper (1979) (and many others): in order to
reduce the estate, the taxpayer has to give up control over assets. Hence, the right framework
for thinking about tax planning is not as tax minimization but rather as a trade-off between
reducing tax liability and losing control over assets. A taxpayer who does not value control
may be able to significantly reduce tax liability, while taxpayers with significant preference
for retaining control will choose not to do so.
Perhaps the most direct evidence in favor of this trade-off is provided by Kopczuk (2007).
Relying on (publicly available) estate tax returns filed in 1977, he first shows that the size of
estate at death in this very wealthy elderly sample is strongly correlated with age, indicating
that wealth accumulation continues until very old age (there is sufficient data to show crosssectional upward sloping wealth profile extending to people in their 90s). However, since the
estate tax return form used to include (reported by the executor of the estate) information
about the length of terminal illness, it is possible to evaluate the effect of terminal illness
on the size of the estate. It turns out that the effect is very strong — 15 to 20% drop
with an illness lasting “months to years.” After evaluating alternative explanations, he
concludes that the most likely one is tax avoidance. In particular, composition of assets
and deductions reported on tax returns changes in a way indicating tax avoidance and a
very strong response is present for “lifetime transfers” — gifts that need to be included
on the estate tax return because they were made shortly before or in anticipation of death
(and hence are “unsuccessful” in obtaining preferential gift tax treatment), but that are
likely fingerprints of tax avoidance.51 Taken together, it suggests that despite continuing
51

Such transfers are reported on Schedule G of the estate tax form. They may correspond to attempts at

45

accumulation, wealthy taxpayers underinvest in tax planning until the onset of a terminal
illness, but they still reveal by their actions at the end of life that they value tax reductions.
Because tax planning is much more effective when done early, it implies that taxpayers also
forgo significant tax savings. This pattern of behavior requires a combination of the desire
to leave a bequest and some form of a reason not to part with wealth while alive. Some
notion of benefits from controlling wealth is a natural candidate here.
The desire to retain control is also consistent with previously discussed evidence about
strong responsiveness of gifts to tax incentives, even though the level of giving is grossly
insufficient for the purpose of minimizing tax liability. Such behavior could be naturally
explained by simultaneous desire to reduce taxation coupled with some control motive.
An alternative explanation, not yet seriously explored in this context, is the possibility of
inattention — taxpayers may not be paying attention to tax consequences. While possible,
this is also a population that is financially sophisticated and one that in most cases has
professional assistance in place. Still, inadequate life insurance holdings by business owners
(Holtz-Eakin et al., 2001) could potentially be explained by this motivation.52
While the literature has been exploring explanation for wealth accumulation due to precautionary motives — longevity, health care costs, long-term care insurance — such evidence
does not appear as applicable for thinking about very high net worth individuals who are
subject to the estate tax and who, one might think, have sufficient wealth for such precautionary considerations not to be important. As discussed previously, some form of utility
from holding on to wealth appears necessary for successfully explaining the upper tail of
wealth distribution and direct microeconomic evidence on this topic remains limited.

6.2

Tax avoidance and evasion

There were some attempts to estimate the overall extent of tax avoidance and evasion in this
context. Wolff (1996) and Poterba (2000b) proposed an approach that is based on comparing
estate tax returns to wealth of the living population (in practice, the data from Survey of
tax avoidance that were not successful because of premature death but they may also correspond to successful
tax avoidance strategies. For example, many trust instruments involve a transfer from the taxpayer to the
trust. A popular example is an irrevocable life insurance trust that is intended to exclude the proceeds of a
policy from the estate (incidentally, popularity of gifts of life insurance might possibly be partially explained
by the desire to postpone giving control over assets to children). Private annuities discussed by Cooper
(1979) may involve a transfer if not fairly priced. Disposing of stocks by a majority shareholder at or before
death, in order to reduce holdings to a minority position and therefore qualify for a minority discount may
involve a direct transfer. A transfer of an asset to a family limited partnership in exchange for a minority
interest (with associated minority discount, see Schmalbeck, 2001, p. 133, for an example) and retained right
to interest or use would be included on Schedule G. Proceeds of buy-out agreements to be executed at death
popular at that time may also have been reported on Schedule G. A non-estate tax reason for Schedule G
transfers may be an attempt to avoid probate.
52
Motivated by Becker (1973), Kopczuk and Slemrod (2005) model theoretically the “denial of death”
behavior with agents rationally repressing information (as in Carrillo and Mariotti, 2000; Bénabou and
Tirole, 2002) about their mortality in order to reduce the psychological cost due to high mortality risk.

46

Consumer Finances). In order to make this comparison, wealth of the living is weighted by
mortality risk, and the difference between such mortality-risk weighted wealth and observed
estates is interpreted as reflecting the extent of tax evasion (and forms of tax avoidance that
would give rise to the difference in wealth during lifetime and at death). This procedure
needs to take a stand on the appropriate mortality rates to use (mortality experience of
high net worth individuals is unlikely to be well-proxied by mortality rates for the general
public) and cannot account for adjustments shortly before death discussed before. As the
result, as Eller et al. (2001) elaborate, different assumptions about mortality assumptions
lead to estimates varying from 70% of tax loss to the very small amount. Furthermore,
this procedure is sensitive to assumptions about mortality differences between married and
single individuals and about the distribution of charitable bequests.
An alternative approach is to rely on audits. Audit-based studies estimate the extent of
non-compliance at 8 to 13% of the overall tax liability (Eller and Johnson, 1999; Erard,
1999) but they cannot identify legal or unchallenged types of responses. Audits of estate
tax returns used to be fairly common — Eller et al. (2001) report that they applied to
19% of estates overall and almost 50% of returns with gross estate over $5 million —
so that the scope for easily detectable and obviously illegal tax evasion is arguably not
large. Instead, responses likely take the form of plausibly legal but often legally uncertain
strategies. Somewhat surprisingly, Eller et al. (2001) find that almost 20% of estates had
their tax liability reduced. At the same time, in 60% of cases the assessed tax increased
indicating an important role for enforcement. Changes primarily involved revaluation of
assets, with noncompliance spread out over most categories of assets. Mortgages and notes
and insurance featured the largest percentage revaluation, adjustments to closely held stock
were most important in aggregate and there were only small adjustments for stocks and
mutual funds. These patterns are consistent with the presence of opportunities for tax
evasion and tax avoidance motivated by legal uncertainty surrounding valuation of assets
that result in aggressive tax planning.
A small number of papers looked at particular types of legal avoidance-related responses.
Johnson et al. (2001) and Schmalbeck (2001) discuss the most important avenues for tax
avoidance. Valuation of assets is one of the key issues. Estates have an option of valuing
assets either as of time of death or using alternative valuation as of six months after death.
For assets that are easily marketable, IRS regulations specify that they should be valued
using market prices in the case of stocks or using comparative sales in case of real estate.
Assets such as as pieces of art should be valued by experts. Valuation tables taking into
account life expectancy and market rates of returns exist for valuing annuities and partial
interest — some tax avoidance strategies are designed by arbitraging the tables and personal
circumstances (e.g., when mortality risk is known to deviate from that assumed by the IRS).
Valuing closely-held businesses is notoriously difficult. This is aggravated by existence of
additional rules applying in this context. Special use valuation applies to particular types
47

of businesses and family farms that, if they qualify, can be valued at actual rather than
market use. Minority and marketability discounts are a particularly important avenue
for reducing tax liability. They allow for a reduction in taxable value of an assets if the
taxpayer does not hold a controlling interest or when there is no easily available market for
the particular asset. Johnson et al. (2001) found that approximately 6% of returns used
minority or lack-of-marketability discounts that were on average 10% of the gross estate
(conditional on use). Poterba and Weisbenner (2003) compare asset information from the
Survey of Consumer Finances, weighted by mortality rates, to the asset composition on
estate tax returns reported by the IRS. They find patterns consistent with significant use
of minority discounts for non-marketable assets. Their results raise the possibility that the
opportunities for valuation discounts present in the estate tax system induce important
inter-asset distortions.

6.3

Unrealized capital gains

One of the important features of the U.S. capital gains tax is the step up in basis at death.
Consider an asset with the basis of p that by the time of death of the owner is worth p·(1+r).
If sold just before taxpayer’s death, proceeds would be subject to the capital gains
tax tG

and then to the estate tax τ , resulting in the overall bequest of p · 1 + r · (1 − tG ) · (1 − τ ).
If held until death without realizing the gain, the basis of the asset is reset to its value at
the time of death and the overall value of a transfer is p · (1 + r) · (1 − τ ). In particular,
this is the liquidation value of the bequest if the recipient/estate chooses to realize the gain
immediately after taxpayer’s death.
This feature of the tax system gives rise to a strong incentive to hold capital gains until
death. The distortion to the holding period is present even in the absence of step-up in
basis, reflecting benefits from deferral of taxation on realized capital gains,53 but the step-up
in basis introduces a particularly strong form of the associated lock-in effect. The literature
on capital gains realizations (for example, Burman and Randolph, 1994; Burman, 1999;
Auerbach et al., 2000; Dai et al., 2008) focused on distortions to the holding period and
related tax avoidance strategies.
A small number of papers analyzed the interaction of estate tax and capital gains taxation.
Poterba (2001) shows that taxpayers with larger unrealized capital gains are less likely to
make inter vivos gifts, thereby providing indirect evidence of the lock-in effect being present
in practice. On the other hand, Auten and Joulfaian (2001) present evidence that higher
estate tax weakens the magnitude of the lock-in effect by encouraging capital gains realizations earlier in life. One possible channel is via the estate tax encouraging consumption or
charitable bequests; another theoretical possibility is that in the presence of the estate tax,
53
See Auerbach (1991) and Auerbach and Bradford (2004) for a theoretical proposals of a realization-based
tax system that would eliminate holding period distortions.

48

the effective capital gains marginal tax rates associated with rebalancing of taxpayer’s portfolio are smaller than otherwise because they reduce taxable estate and hence tax liability.
Finally, taxpayers may want to realize capital gains early as part of their tax avoidance
strategy.
Poterba and Weisbenner (2001) use the SCF data to analyze distributional implications
of replacing the estate tax by constructive realization of capital gains at death. While
revenue estimates are dated, because of changes in rates and exemptions since then, the
paper documents significant heterogeneity in the importance of unrealized gains and hence
distributional implications of such a policy switch. Indeed, the 2010 “repeal” highlighted
some of these issues in practice. The elimination of the estate tax was associated with
basis carryover (rather than constructive realization that Poterba and Weisbenner, 2001,
assumed).54 Reduction in tax liability generated by differences in marginal tax rates under
capital gains and estate taxation was not uniform, because (among other reasons) the
distribution of unrealized capital gains is not uniform. Naturally, many taxpayers dying
with capital gains are not subject to the estate tax but they still do benefit from step
up. Hence, the replacement of carryover provision could actually increase their tax burden
relative to the estate tax. This has been mitigated by allowing for up to $1.3 million of assets
to continue to benefit from the step up. Still, given the 2009 exemption of $3.5 million and
availability of deductions for marital bequests (among other things) that change would have
resulted in an increase in tax burden for some otherwise nontaxable taxpayers.55 While the
retroactive repeal made this issue moot for 2010, distributional implications of the relative
estate tax vs capital gains treatment will continue to be an important issue in considering
future reform proposals.

Implications for wealth distribution and intergenerational transmission of inequality

A large literature has focused on the role of transfers and, sometimes, their taxation
in understanding wealth accumulation. Prominently, Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) and
Modigliani (1988) reached dramatically different conclusions about the importance of inter54
Under the constructive realization regime, capital gains would be subject to the tax at the time of death
with the step up basis for the recipient reset to the value at death. Under carryover basis, the recipient
assumes the basis of the original owner and the tax is not due until the asset is sold. Hence, under the
carryover basis capital gains are taxed later and realization may continue to be distorted due to the presence
of locked-in gains that accrued to the original owner.
55
Many commentators and practitioners also worry about administrative complexity of implementing a
carryover regime that requires recipients to keep track of the basis of the original owner — potentially for
generations. Presumed complexity was one the main reasons why the 1976 provision to introduce carryover
basis has never gone into effect.

49

generational transfers in overall wealth accumulation; methodological issues and findings of
the resulting literature are summarized in Davies and Shorrocks (2000) who conclude that
inheritances are responsible for approximately 35-45% of current wealth. More interestingly,
the literature — recently reviewed by Cagetti and De Nardi (2008) — has firmly concluded
that while realistic life-cycle framework may account for much of wealth accumulation (for
example, Hubbard et al., 1994, 1995; Scholz et al., 2006), understanding the full distribution of wealth requires incorporating some form of a bequest motive (Gale and Scholz, 1994;
Dynan et al., 2002, 2004; De Nardi, 2004). A small number of papers analyzed implications of changes in estate taxation for the wealth distribution. The long-term implications
are ambiguous in general. Stiglitz (1978) highlights general equilibrium implications of the
estate tax: an increase in the estate tax leads to a reduction in capital accumulation and
an increase in return to capital; depending on the elasticity of substitution between labor
and capital, it may then result in overall increase in the share of capital income. Since
capital income is more unequally distributed than labor income, this may result in overall
increase in inequality of income and consumption. Using dynamic models augmented to
account for, respectively, idiosyncratic labor endowment risk and entrepreneurial risk and
calibrated to match selected moments of income and wealth distribution, Castaneda et al.
(2003) and Cagetti and De Nardi (2009) conclude that long-term implications of repealing
the estate tax for wealth inequality are small, although distributional implications depend
on the source of revenue used to replace the estate tax and efficiency improves. Benhabib
et al. (2011) instead allow for capital income risk and, in their policy experiment, find that
implications of changes in estate taxation for inequality of wealth are quantitatively large.
They argue that the strong effect of estate taxation on wealth inequality in their framework
is driven by its effect on capital income dispersion.
Papers in this strand of the literature are routinely calibrated to (static) moments of income
and wealth distribution. However, such analysis has not yet incorporated empirical evidence
on behavioral responses to estate taxation or bequest motives, hence quantitative implications are likely to be model-dependent. It also treats tax systems in a very stylized manner.
Consequently, the results that are supposed to pertain to changes in estate taxation have
to be treated very cautiously. In particular, as mentioned when discussing bequest motives,
observational implications of the joy-of-giving and wealth-in-utility models are identical except for the consequences of changes in inheritance taxation. Hence, in a model calibrated to
the empirical moments of wealth and income distribution for a particular estate tax structure (the standard procedure in this literature), implications of changing the estate tax
are driven by assumptions about bequest motives that are completely arbitrary: because
the commonly assumed56 joy-of-giving motive and wealth-in-utility can generate the same
distribution of wealth, calibration procedure pins down the implicit strength of behavioral
response to taxation using the assumption about the form of a bequest motive rather than
56

Altruistic motive is not sufficient to generate a thick upper tail of the wealth distribution.

50

by appealing to any observable quantities. As the result, predictions about the impact of
changes in estate taxation in this kind of framework are to a large (but unknown) extent
driven by modeling assumptions. One could imagine calibrating a model of this kind to the
empirical elasticities of bequests to marginal tax rates, perhaps simply by allowing for a
mix of the joy-of-giving and wealth-in-utility motivations in order to gain an extra degree of
freedom, but it has not been done yet (and neither are the implied micro elasticities explicitly reported in these papers). This approach has, however, the advantage of considering
general equilibrium and long-term implications
Calibration of either initial or steady-state of the economy to a distribution at a point in
time is convenient but likely to miss first-order features of the actual practical experience.
Recent work of Piketty et al. (2003), Kopczuk and Saez (2004a) and Roine and Waldenström
(2009) documents long-term evolution of wealth concentration.57 The key point is that
wealth concentration has significantly evolved over time. Piketty (2011) shows that the
overall annual flow of bequests in France exceeded 20% in the 19th century, fell to 5% by
the 1950s and increased to 15% by the early 21st century. These changes highlight that
modeling long-term steady-state distribution of wealth, as much of literature has done, is
likely to miss first-order facts about historical and future experience. Piketty (2011) shows
that these patterns can be accounted by changes in the relationship of growth rate and
private rate of return and, hence, as that relationship changes, the role of inheritance in
generating inequality changes as well. Piketty and Saez (2012a) build on this insight to
study the role of capital and inheritance taxation in a framework that allows for both labor
and inheritance inequality to influence welfare objectives and find a role for inheritance
taxation that varies with the overall share of inheritances.
The U.S. evidence on changes in wealth concentration is somewhat inconclusive. In an
influential paper, Piketty and Saez (2003) documented dramatic changes in income shares
at the very top of the distribution (see Atkinson et al., 2011, for a recent review of this
literature) since the 1970s. These changes were to a large extent labor income phenomena. A
number of papers attempted to document the corresponding trends in wealth concentration
but found no or only small increase in wealth accruing to the very richest (see Kennickell
(2006) and Scholz (2003) using Survey of Consumer Finances data and Kopczuk and Saez
(2004a) using estate multiplier technique). Edlund and Kopczuk (2009) show that the
composition of the top wealth holders has dramatically changed over the last 30 years,
shifting from inheritors to self-made — these patterns are visible explicitly in the Forbes list
of the richest Americans and can be indirectly corroborated based on the gender composition
of top estate taxpayers relying on the assumption that self-made wealth is more male-biased
than inheritances. They argue that this change in composition — new wealth building up
57

This line of research generally relies on estate multiplier technique, building on older work of Mallet
(1908), Atkinson and Harrison (1978) and Lampman (1962). See Piketty (2011) for additional references
and appendices in Kopczuk and Saez (2004b) for the discussion of the limitations of this approach.

— are consistent with both income inequality increases and relative stability of wealth
concentration.

7.2

Charity

Deduction for charitable contributions is the second largest deduction (after marital deduction) used by estate taxpayers and the largest one for unmarried decedents. By exempting
charitable bequests from taxation, the estate tax provides price incentives to contribute to
charity rather than to other beneficiaries. The presence of the estate tax also has wealth
effect that should reduce overall charitable bequests (assuming that they are a normal
good). A strand of literature tried to understand how these incentives affect charitable
contributions; in particular, attempting to separate price and wealth effects and attempting
to evaluate the overall impact of taxation on the flow of charity. Cross-sectional evidence
(McNees, 1973; Boskin, 1976; Joulfaian, 1991; Auten and Joulfaian, 1996; Joulfaian, 1998)
has problems separately identifying the direct of wealth from the effect of tax price because
wealth and tax price are in practice correlated. Joulfaian (2000) uses cross-sectional state
level variation that improves on earlier identification strategies but continues to be subject to concerns about endogeneity of state tax policy and taxpayers’ mobility. Barthold
and Plotnick (1984) use data from probate records in Connecticut in the 1930s and 1940s.
Brunetti (2005) studied effect of the repeal of the California estate tax in 1982 using 1980-82
probate records from San Francisco. Kopczuk and Slemrod (2003b) rely instead of time
series evidence using current and lagged marginal tax rates. Bakija et al. (2003) rely on
repeated cross-sectional tabulations based on IRS estate tax return data and state-level
variation in tax rates. Joulfaian (2005b) uses microdata for estate taxpayers in 1976 and
1982 and exploits variation generated by changes in marginal tax rates and exemption that
took place in between.
The literature generally finds that charitable bequests are very sensitive to both their tax
price and to wealth, with the first effect dominating so that eliminating the estate tax would
likely lead to reduction in charitable bequests. A number of papers additionally recognized
that incentives to give at death are also affected by other taxes. For example, a taxpayer
making lifetime gifts could additionally benefit from income tax deduction. Alternatively,
giving in life and at death may be complements, so that high income tax rates may increase
charitable bequests. Bakija et al. (2005) and Joulfaian (2001) account for lifetime incentives
and find that they matter but that bequests remain very sensitive to tax rates at death.
A channel that the literature acknowledges (e.g., Bernheim, 1987; Kopczuk and Slemrod,
2003b) but that has not been extensively studied empirically is the interaction of charitable
bequests with tax avoidance. Indeed, some of the prominent tax avoidance techniques
have a charitable contribution components or, conditional on making legitimate charitable
52

gift, there may be additional tax opportunities depending on how the gift is structured
(Schmalbeck, 2001). This is an interesting area for future work.

7.3

Other issues

An important consideration in tax planning is the treatment of marital bequests. Before
2011, taxpayers with a surviving spouse had an incentive to limit the bequest to the surviving spouse in order to take advantage of the exemption. More generally, there is an
incentive (quantitatively important, at least at low estate levels) to go through the progressive tax schedule twice by splitting the bequest between the spouse and other potential
beneficiaries. Empirically, heavy reliance on the marital deduction is very common but, as
recognized by estate tax planners, it raises difficult issues related to the conflict of interest
between spouses — preferences about the ultimate disposition of bequest may differ and
hence the transfer to the spouse may result in the ultimate disposition of bequests that is
inconsistent with preferences of the first-to-die spouse. While this could potentially be evidence in support of a unitary household model, Johnson et al. (2001) document widespread
use and Kopczuk and Slemrod (2003b) analyze implications of the so-called Qualified Terminable Interest Property (QTIP) trusts that can resolve this tension: introduced in 1982,
such trusts are transferred to the widow or widower who gains access to earnings but at her
death the principal is transferred to the beneficiaries indicated by the first-to-die spouse’s
will. Hence, they qualify for a marital deduction but allow for addressing the conflict of
interest.
A few papers considered the issues related to jurisdictional-level estate taxes. Bakija and
Slemrod (2004) and Conway and Rork (2006) focus on impact of state-level taxes on elderly
mobility using longitudinal variation in state tax rates. Bakija and Slemrod (2004) find
significant but modest effects, while Conway and Rork (2006) find no impact and instead
argue for the reverse causality with mobility affecting tax rate setting. Conway and Rork
(2004) find some evidence of tax competition between U.S. estates in this dimension, while
Brülhart and Parchet (2011) do not find competitive effects for the Swiss cantons.
Several papers attempted to provide explanations for introduction and elimination of estate
taxes. Bertocchi (2011) attempted to link evolution of estate taxation to the dynamics
of wealth accumulation induced by the process of industrialization. Scheve and Stasavage
(2012) focus on the role of wars. Graetz and Shapiro (2005) discuss politics surrounding
estate tax changes in the United States in 2000s.

Summary and conclusions

In this chapter, I reviewed theoretical and empirical literature on taxation of intergenerational transfers. As signaled in the introduction, the conclusions are mixed and pointing
53

to the need for further research. The normative analysis has overemphasized the importance of externalities from giving, while not adequately accounting for the importance of
inherited wealth. When taking an ex ante perspective, inherited wealth is endogenous and
does not constitute a reason for redistribution per se. While this is consistent with the
logic of that model, it does not reflect the possibility that policy makers may be instead focused on redistribution within a generation. The steady-state approaches (Kopczuk, 2001;
Piketty and Saez, 2012a,b) find a positive role for capital taxation but it imposes restrictive
assumptions.
The key empirical observation that should feed into theoretical work is the presence of
heterogeneity. The literature on bequest motives has failed to identify the single motive
and instead points to both mixed motives present at the same time for a given person
and to heterogeneity in preferences in the population. In particular, the first-order fact in
understanding behavior of the very wealthy is the importance of control over wealth. The
presence of such a motive is consistent with relative scarcity of giving during lifetime coupled
with significant tax avoidance and increasing age-wealth profiles. Some direct preference
for wealth (rather than consumption or welfare of children) is necessary to account for the
extent of wealth concentration.
The empirical work has focused on many dimensions of distortions due to the estate tax
and generally has found evidence that a number of decisions are sensitive to the tax rates
— estates at death, tax avoidance, inter vivos giving, charitable contributions. It has also
identified interesting and adverse effects on labor supply of donors and performance of
family businesses. At the same time, the identification issues in this context are difficult
and rarely satisfactorily addressed. In particular, the estate tax incentives operate over a
long period of time and relating such incentives to wealth accumulation (which is perhaps
the most interesting dimension of responsiveness) is notoriously difficult. The literature
has been more successful in analyzing decisions where focusing on short-term incentives is
appropriate, such as the inter vivos giving.
Tax avoidance is believed to be very important in practice but precise econometric evidence
is scarce. In particular, issues related to separating response of wealth accumulation from
tax avoidance (both of which affect reported estates), the interaction of charity and tax
avoidance, impact of cross-asset differences in effective tax rates, the role of family structure
and conflicts of interest, use of family related partnerships, valuation issues for closely-held
business and other types of assets have all received only limited attention from economists.
Finally, the topic that has not yet been incorporated in the formal models of intergenerational transfers are potential negative externalities from wealth concentration. Examples
are positional externalities (Frank, 2008), the impact of corporate power on the political
process (Morck et al., 2005) and previously discussed evidence of inheritance of control
resulting in mis-allocation of entrepreneurial skills. Recently, a number of papers started
54

considering implications of negative externalities associated with income inequality — primarily rent-seeking — for optimal taxation (Rothschild and Scheuer, 2011; Piketty et al.,
2011). Incorporating such considerations in the analysis of intergenerational transfers is
long overdue.
