Innovation and Productivity across Four European Countries

ABSTRACT
This paper compares the role innovation plays in productivity across the four European countries France,
Germany, Spain and the UK using firm-level data from the internationally harmonized Community
Innovation Surveys (CIS3). Despite a considerable number of national firm-level studies analysing
this relationship, cross-country comparisons using micro data are still rare. We apply a structural model
that describes the link between R&D expenditure, innovation output and productivity (CDM model).
Our econometric results suggest that overall the systems driving innovation and productivity are remarkably
similar across these four countries, although we also find interesting differences, particularly in the
variation in productivity that is associated with more or less innovative activities.

Introduction

The poor productivity performance of European countries relative to the US has been an important
focus for government policy. Table 1 shows aggregate productivity levels and growth rates in 2000.1
But, it is not only that Europe is lagging behind the US, but that there are also larger differences
across European countries in labour productivity development, for instance between Spain at the
lower and the UK at the upper bound. Emphasis has been placed on the need for Europe to move into
the “knowledge-based economy”. Post-war growth in Europe, it is argued, was largely based on
imitation, driven by capital accumulation, while what is needed now is for European countries to shift
towards growth based on innovation.2 In fact, R&D intensity in the four major EU countries (France,
Germany, Spain and the UK) lies behind US as can be seen in Table 1.
[Table 1 here]
What role does innovation play in productivity growth across European countries? There are two
major challenges facing researchers trying to answer this question - how do we measure innovation
and can we get data that are comparable across countries? Commonly used measures of innovation
are R&D expenditures or patent counts. While both have strengths as measures of innovation they
also have weaknesses. R&D is a measure of inputs, and takes no account of the productivity and
effectiveness of effort. Patents are a crude measure of outputs, capturing only some sorts of invention,
and being of very differing values.
In this paper, we use comparative data across European countries at the firm level from the
harmonized Community Innovation Surveys (CIS data), which provides indicators of innovation
input and outcomes. Our interest focuses in comparing firm-level innovation and productivity
behaviour across countries, which has been hampered in the past due to a lack of internationally
comparable data, in particular as concerns innovation. Precisely we estimate a structural model for

1

We report figures for the end of the nineties to 2000 in Table 1 because it is the time span of the data we used in the

econometric part. More recent data still confirms this pattern across the countries.

manufacturing firms in France, Germany, Spain and the UK, that directly links R&D to innovation
outcomes and then links innovation to productivity. This allows us to disentangle the contribution of
R&D intensity per se from the effectiveness of innovative effort in leading to productivity gains.3
In summary, our results suggest that overall the systems driving innovation and productivity are
remarkably similar across France, Germany, Spain and the UK, although we also find interesting
differences, particularly in the variation in productivity that is associated with more or less innovative
activities.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the framework and describes the data.
Section III presents the results and some robustness checks. Section IV concludes. Appendix A
provides a formal description of the econometric model estimated, and Appendix B comments the
data in more detail.

II Model and Data
II.i

Model

In this paper we apply a structural model which has the following basic form: firms decide how
much effort to put into innovation; knowledge is produced as a result of this investment; output is
produced using knowledge (along with other inputs). This model is formalised in four equations: (i)
the firm’s decision to engage in sufficient effort to result in observable research and development
(R&D) investment, (ii) the intensity with which the firm undertakes R&D, or R&D investment
function, (iii) the innovation or knowledge production function, where we allow knowledge to take
two different forms - process and product innovations, and (iv) the output production function, where

3

“The productivity of innovative effort” is what Mairesse and Mohnen in comparable work propose to call for short

“innovativeness” or “innovativity”. See Mairesse and Mohnen (2002, 2005) and Mohnen et al. (2006).

6

knowledge is an input. The model is based on Crépon, Duguet and Mairesse (1998), henceforth called
CDM model.4 Technical details on the model and its estimation are given in Appendix A.
In contrast to most previous studies we estimate the CDM model not only for innovative but for all
firms. That is, we estimate step (i) and (ii) based on reported R&D figures and use predicted values
for all firms to proxy innovation effort in the knowledge production function. This model reflects the
fact that all firms exert some innovative effort, but not all firms report this effort.5 For example,
production workers may well spend a small part of their day considering how the process they are
working on could be achieved more efficiently. However, below a certain threshold, a firm will not
report this effort as R&D. The output of this innovation effort produces knowledge. As indicated
above, we allow knowledge output to take several forms, including process and product innovations,
and we assume that effort is a public good within the firm, so it can be used to produce several
outputs without depletion. We estimate the relationship between R&D investment and process and
product innovation outputs using data on firms that report both, and impute knowledge output for all
firms based on these estimates. The idea is that we believe that a firm that reports zero R&D does not
actually have zero knowledge output. This approach assumes that the process describing R&D
investment and innovation outputs for non R&D reporting firms is the same as for reporting firms.

4

Other studies which have used different versions of the CDM model include Lööf and Heshmati (2002, 2006) for

Swedish manufacturing firms, Klomp and Van Leeuwen (2001) and Van Leeuwen and Klomp (2006) using Dutch
manufacturing data, Criscuolo and Haskell (2003) using UK CIS1 and CIS2 data, Janz et al. (2004) using German and
Swedish CIS3 data, Parisi et al. (2005) using data for Italian manufacturing firms, Mairesse and Mohnen (2002, 2005) and
Mohnen et al. (2006) using French CIS1 and CIS3 data, Benavente (2006) for Chilean firms, Jefferson (2006) for a panel
of Chinese firms, Peters (2006) for a panel of German firms. See also Hall and Mairesse (2006). For a presentation of the
more traditional approach of estimating R&D productivity and rate of returns directly in terms of an extended production
function, see, inter alia, Griliches (1979, 1994, 1996) and Griliches and Mairesse (1998).
5

In addition to R&D expenditures stricto sensu (as defined by the Frascati manual, OECD 1963), the Community

Innovation Surveys also include questions on several other specific innovation expenditures, i.e. expenditures related to
the acquisition of other external knowledge, to the acquisition of machinery and equipment and training activities in the
context of innovations, to market introduction of innovations, and to design and other preparation activities for the
production and delivery of new products (Oslo manual, Eurostat and OECD, 1997). Many firms in the French CIS3
apparently did not understand them well. We have preferred here to stay with the more usual R&D variable, and not use

7

Finally, in the model firms produce output using a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas technology
with labour, capital and knowledge inputs.
We choose this structural model because it captures the main features of firm behaviour, but is at
the same time parsimonious and empirically tractable with the data we have available.
II.ii Data and Empirical Implementation
In this study we take advantage of the data from the third wave of the Community Innovation
Surveys (CIS3). The CIS is a harmonised survey that is carried out by national statistical agencies in
all 25 EU Member States under the co-ordination of Eurostat. CIS3 was conducted in 2001 and
provides information for the period 1998-2000.6 To fully exploit the comparable nature of the
information we have had to assemble researchers from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K who had
access to the underlying original firm level data collected under CIS.7 Great care has been taken to
make these micro data fully comparable across the four countries, and this is one strength of our
investigation. For a more detailed description of the data sets and their comparability across countries
see Abramovsky et al (2004).
As mentioned above, we believe that all firms exert some innovative effort, so we use the whole
sample of firms, and not only innovating firms. To explain which firms report R&D we have to take
the specific characteristics of the data set into account. One distinctive feature of the CIS
questionnaire in France, Germany and Spain is that it asked all firms for a few general information,
such as the number of employees and the industry to which the firm belongs, and whether they have
(completed, ongoing or abandoned) innovation activities or not. Only those firms with innovation

the “Total innovation expenditures” variable including these other innovation expenditures. Our estimates using this more
broadly defined variable, rather than R&D, are practically unchanged for Germany and Spain.
6

The survey was also carried out in Iceland and Norway as well as Turkey and Romania. Furthermore other non

European countries have carried out surveys equivalent to CIS3.
7

Eurostat publishes results on a highly aggregated sector level (manufacturing, wholesale trade, producer services) for

each country (Eurostat, 2004) and Eurostat's online data base, New Cronos, also only provides information at the sector
level. Since recently, Eurostat also proposes access to anonymised micro-aggregated CIS3 data. However, these data are
currently available for only 12 out of the 25 EU countries, with Germany, France and the UK not being provided.

8

activities are requested to answer to a lot of additional questions, like those on co-operations,
information sources etc. R&D performers are by definition firms with innovation activities. Hence to
explain of whether firms have R&D or not, we can only use limited information available for all
firms. We use an indicator of whether the international market is the firm’s most important market to
capture the exposition to international competition, indicators of whether the firm receives public
funding, and measures of appropriability conditions that the firm faces - the extent of legal and formal
protection of intellectual property in the country. Effective appropriability conditions are important in
that they allow innovators to receive the returns on their innovation activities. As a result, they also
increase the incentives for and amount of innovation activities (Spence 1984). We also use size and
industry dummy variables, as well as a dummy variable for Eastern Germany in the German sample.
Detailed variable definitions are given in Appendix B.
We use a larger set of variables to explain R&D intensity measured as R&D expenditures per
employee (in logs). Here we also consider demand conditions - whether environmental, health and
safety or other regulatory standards were an important reason for innovating - along with an indicator
of whether the enterprise had some co-operative arrangements on innovation activities during 19982000, a set of categorical variables reflecting different sources of information for innovation and
indicators for public support for that firm at the local, national or EU level.
As already stated, we distinguish two different kinds of innovation outcome: product and process
innovations. Both are measured by a dummy variable indicating whether the firm has introduced at
least one product and process innovation, respectively. In addition to R&D intensity we explain the
innovation outcome by the same group of demand pull indicators and appropriability conditions.
Furthermore, we expect firms to be more successful in product innovation activities if they used
customers or competitors as information source and in process innovation activities if they used
information stemming from their suppliers or competitors. We also include investment per employee
in the production of process innovations, because we want to allow for complementarities between
process innovation and investment in capital that embodies new process technologies. We do not
9

include it in product innovation because we do not see evidence of such complementarities in that
case.
Productivity is measured as labour productivity (sales per employee, in logs) and depends on the
knowledge measured in terms of product and process innovation outcomes. Since we do not observe
physical capital in the data for all countries we proxy for it in the productivity equation by
investments in physical capital.
We allow all coefficients to vary across countries (i.e., we estimate our model separately for the
four countries). In all equations we control for unobserved industry characteristics. We further control
for firm size in all equations but the R&D intensity equation, R&D intensity being already implicitly
scaled for size. When included in this equation, the size indicators are not significant, and our
estimates in the other equations of the model are not affected.
Descriptive statistics of the main variables in the model are reported for the four countries in Table
2. We restrict our analysis to firms with at least 20 employees.8 Some differences and similarities are
worth noting.
[Table 2 here]
The proportions of firms reporting that they are engaged in R&D and have process and product
innovations are greater in France and Germany than in Spain or the UK. French and German firms
that do R&D also do so more intensively than their Spanish and U.K counterparts, i.e. R&D intensity
of R&D-performers is much higher. This confirms the general pattern found at the aggregate level in
Table 1. Note that in results not shown the performance in terms of shares of sales for new or
substantially improved products is about the same for the German, Spanish and UK product
innovating firms, but higher than for the French firms, which are less successful in commercializing
their innovative products. French firms draw on formal measures to protect returns from innovation

8

In Germany, the UK and Spain, the CIS3 covers all enterprises with 10 or more employees. In France, however, the

target population for manufacturing includes firms with 20 or more employees. We restrict ourselves to firms with over
20 employees so we can compare the four countries. The number of firms by industry in each country is given in the data
Appendix Table B.1.

10

almost as often as German or UK firms, but less often on strategic measures. On the other hand,
Spanish firms use both formal and strategic protection measures much less frequently (though they
have a high share of innovative sales). Average labour productivity in manufacturing is highest in
France, and is similar in the UK and Germany, but lower in Spain, which is also what we see at the
aggregate level in Table 1 in terms of GDP per employee. Investment per employee is higher in Spain
than in the other three countries. This may be in part because the average size of Spanish firms is
smaller - average firm number of employees is only 74 for Spain, as compared to 142 in France, 155
in Germany and 116 in the UK.
Other notable differences are the following: public support for R&D is lower in the U.K;
government is also less of a source of information in the UK; universities are a greater source of
information in Germany; and Spanish and UK firms face less international competition in the sense
that international markets are less often the firm’s most important market.

III Results
We now turn to a discussion of the estimates of the parameters of the structural model described
above and formally set out in Appendix A. Before interpreting the results we point to an important
caveat of the study: we only have cross-section data, and most of the factors we consider are
simultaneously determined. Therefore, we need to take great care in interpreting our results - all we
are able to recover are correlations, these are not necessarily causal relationships.
III.i R&D and R&D intensity
We start by considering estimates of the determinants of whether firms undertake R&D, and if so
how much R&D. The first four columns (left hand panel) in Table 3 show estimates of the
determinants of whether a firm engages in R&D continuously over the period 1998-2000, with one
column for each country. As discussed above (in section II.i), we consider all firms as engaging in
innovative activity, but only some engaging in a sufficient amount for it to be reported as “continuous
R&D”. In the first panel we estimate a discrete (probit) model. The second four columns (right hand
11

panel) in Table 3 show the corresponding estimates of the determinants of how much firms invest in
R&D, conditional on doing R&D.
The numbers reported in these tables are marginal effects. All of the explanatory variables are
dummy variables - they take the value 1 when the factor is important to the firm or is used by the firm
(see precise definitions in the Data Appendix B) and the value zero if it is unimportant or not used.
Therefore, the “marginal” effect is that of changing the dummy variable from 0 to 1.
[Table 3 here]
Consider the coefficients on the Funding variables. These tell us that French firms that receive
funding from national sources are 25% more likely to report engaging in continuous R&D than firms
that receive no funding from national sources - conditional on the mean values of all of the other
variables. In Germany firms that receive national funding are 40.8% more likely, in Spain 27.3%
more likely, and in the UK 19% more likely. The marginal effect of national funding will differ
across countries due to differences in the funding system as well as potential differences in firm
behaviour.
Overall, the marginal effects reported in Table 3 are surprisingly similar across countries. They
suggest as a whole that broadly comparable processes, in broadly comparable economic environment,
drive firms’ decisions to engage in R&D across the major European countries. Specifically, what we
see is that:
 firms that operate mainly in international markets are more likely to engage in R&D; and they
engage in R&D more intensively (only significantly so in France and Spain);
 firms in industries where greater use is made of formal or strategic methods to protect
innovations are more likely to invest in R&D but given the decision to invest in R&D,
protection measures have almost no impact on the amount of R&D. In Germany strategic
methods are much more important than formal methods, whereas in other countries they are
similar. Note that the weakly negative impact coefficient of strategic measures in Spain stands
out as an exception.
12

 receiving government funding increases the probability that a firm engages in R&D
continuously, national funding has the largest impact; receiving government funding, however,
has very little impact on the intensity of R&D, although national funding does have some
positive impact in Germany and Spain, but a negative impact in France and no impact in the
UK;
 larger firms are more likely to engage in R&D;9
 firms in East Germany are more likely to undertake R&D than those in West Germany. This
result is also observed at the aggregate level, for instance in 2000 the share of continuous R&D
performers in East Germany was 28 % as against 24% in West Germany (see Aschhoff et al.,
2006). This is explained by the existence of special support programmes for firms located in
Eastern Germany to help them catch up on the productivity of West German firms.10
III.ii Knowledge production functions
We next consider the estimates of the knowledge production functions in Table 4. The first four
columns (left-hand panel) show them for process innovation, the four last columns (right-hand panel)
for product innovation. The numbers reported are again marginal effects evaluated at the sample
means. All of the explanatory variables except the first two are dummy variables - they take the value
1 when the factor is important to the firm and the value zero if it is unimportant, and as before the
“marginal” effects are those of changing their value from 0 to 1.
[Table 4 here]
As expected, the marginal effects for R&D intensity are both statistically and economically very
significant. They show most clearly that greater R&D effort per employee leads to a higher
probability of having at least one process innovation and of having at least one product innovation.
The impacts are again remarkably similar across the four countries, although lower for process

9

As already indicated, we exclude the firm size indicators from the R&D intensity equation, but if we include them

they are insignificant.

13

innovation in the UK and higher for product innovation in France. Furthermore, the marginal effects
for physical investment on process innovation are also quite significant for the four countries, with
the impacts being similar although higher in the UK.
The ability to protect an innovation through formal or strategic methods is less important for
process innovation than it is for product innovation; although in contrast to the other three countries
neither is important in the UK. As expected, suppliers are an important source of information for
process innovation, while customers have a considerable influence in stimulating product innovation.
Competitors are not such an important source of information (in magnitude as well as in significance)
compared to suppliers and customers. Environmental regulations are an important driver of process
and product innovation in France, and process innovation in Germany. Standards have a negative
impact on process innovation in France.
There is a huge literature dealing with the relationship between firm size and innovation
activities.11 Our estimates suggest that in all four countries larger firms are more likely to be process
innovators (which makes sense whenever process innovation entails a per unit cost reduction). Larger
firms also appear more likely to be product innovators, especially in Spain, but not in the UK.
III.iii Output production functions
Finally, we consider our estimates of the productivity equation shown in Table 5. The coefficients
reported in this table are elasticities or semi-elasticities, since the dependent variable is the log of
sales per employee.
[Table 5 here]
In contrast to the results for the R&D equations and the knowledge production equations, the
results for labour productivity are quite mixed across the four countries. We thus find that the

10

Detailed information about the funding policy and its effectiveness in Eastern Germany is given in Czarnitzki and

Licht (2006).
11

This literature has been initiated by J. Schumpeter who asserted that large firms in highly concentrated markets have

an advantage in innovation, or so called first Schumpeter hypothesis. For a survey of empirical studies testing such
hypothesis, see, for example, Cohen and Klepper (1996).

14

elasticities of output with respect to investment are close in France and Germany (0.13 in France and
0.11 in Germany) and significantly higher than in Spain and the UK (0.06 in both). This is on the low
side for Spain and the UK, but in line with some previous estimates in the literature using similar
data.12
The process and product innovation impact coefficients appear even more different in the four
countries. The estimated coefficient of process innovation in France is the only statistically
significant one, suggesting that process innovation is on average associated with a 6% increase in
productivity. In the other countries there is surprisingly no such association, which could correspond
to the fact that we are measuring revenue productivity (deflated by industry deflators, not by
individual firm deflators).13 The estimated coefficients of product innovation are significant in
France, Spain and the UK, but not for Germany, accounting for a 18% increase in productivity in
Spain, and a more modest one of about 6% in France and the UK.14

IV Summary and Conclusions
This paper investigates the drivers of innovation and how they feed through into productivity at
the firm-level for the four major European countries - France, Germany, Spain, and the UK - using
data from the third wave of the internationally harmonized Community Innovation Surveys. We
estimate a structural model that describes the link between R&D expenditures, innovation output and
productivity. Importantly, this model allows for the fact that some firms may undertake innovate
efforts but do not report them as R&D.
What do our results imply for policy? In response to recent concerns about lagging productivity
and poor innovative performance in Europe countries, the European Union has set itself the ambitious
target of increasing R&D expenditures to 3% of GDP by 2010 (this is part of the "Lisbon Agenda").

12

See, for example, Huergo and Moreno (2006) for Spanish manufacturing.

13

On this issue, see for example Mairesse and Jaumandreu (2005).

15

Does the EU's poor performance lie primarily in low investment in R&D, or is the main problem that
EU firms do not exploit their innovations well? Are the returns to innovative efforts and to
innovations similar across countries, or do they vary, and so does policy need to have a different
focus in the different countries?
As we stressed in presenting our results, a major drawback of the CIS is that it is a series of crosssections, so we do not observe many of the same firms repeatedly over time. This means that we need
to take great care in interpreting our results - all we are able to recover is correlations, these are not
necessarily causal relationships.
Bearing that caveat in mind, our results show some interesting regularities and some heterogeneity
between the countries. In terms of firms’ decision over whether or not to engage in formal R&D the
determinants are remarkably similar across countries. This suggests that broadly comparable
processes drive firms’ decisions to engage in R&D across the major European countries. Government
funding plays an important role in all countries, with national funding having the largest impact.
Firms that operate mainly in international markets and larger firms are more likely to engage in
formal R&D, as are firms in industries where greater use is made of formal or strategic methods to
protect innovation.
Unsurprisingly, firms’ greater R&D effort per employee made them more likely to be process or
product innovators. Furthermore, firms with higher investment per employee are also more likely to
be process innovators. The ability to protect an innovation through formal or strategic methods is less
important for process innovation than it is for product innovation. Suppliers are an important source
of information for process innovation, while customers are significant in stimulating product
innovation. Competitors are not such an important source of information (in magnitude as well as in
significance) compared to suppliers and customers.

14

It must be noted that our poor estimates of the productivity impacts of process and product innovations in Germany

are not in line with more positive results found by Janz et al. (2004) for knowledge intensive firms and by Peters (2006)
for the more recent period 2000-2002.

16

In contrast to the large coincidence found for the R&D equations and the knowledge production
equations, the results for labour productivity are quite mixed across the four European countries.
Process innovation is only associated with higher productivity in France, in the other countries there
is no such connection. Product innovation is associated with higher productivity in France, Spain and
the UK, but not in Germany.

Appendix A: Econometric Model

Formally we can write our model as follows. Let i = 1,… , N index firms. The first equation
accounts for firms’ innovative effort ri* :

ri* = zi′β + ei ,

(1)

where we consider ri* as an unobserved latent variable, and where zi is a vector of determinants of
innovation effort, β is a vector of parameters of interest, and ei an error term. We can measure (or
proxy) firms’ innovative effort ri* by their R&D expenditures, denoted by ri only if firms do (and/or
report) such expenditures, and thus could only directly estimate equation (1) at the risk of selection
bias. Instead we assume the following selection equation describing whether a firm is doing (and/or
reporting) R&D or not:
⎧1 if
rdi = ⎨
⎩0 if

rdi* = wi′α + ε i > c
,
rdi* = wi′α + ε i ≤ c

(2)

where rdi is the observed binary endogenous variable equal to zero for non-R&D and one for R&D
doing (and/or reporting) firms, rdi* is a corresponding latent variable such that firms decide to do
(and/or report) R&D if it is above a certain threshold level c, and where wi is a vector of variables
explaining the R&D decision, α a vector of parameters of interest, and ε i an error term.
Conditional on firm i doing (and/or reporting) R&D activities, we can observe the amount of
resources invested in R&D, and write:
⎧r * = zi′β + ei
ri = ⎨ i
⎩0

if

rdi = 1

if

rdi = 0

.

(3)

18

Assuming that the error terms ei and ε i are bivariate normal with zero mean, variances σ ε2 = 1 and

σ e2 and correlation coefficient ρeε , we estimate the system of equations (2) and (3) as a generalized
Tobit model by maximum likelihood (using STATA and Heckman procedure to choose initial values
for the parameters).

The next equations in our model are the knowledge or innovation production functions:

gi = ri*γ + xi′δ + ui ,

(4)

where gi is knowledge proxied by both the product and process innovation indicators, and where the
latent innovation effort, ri* , enters as explanatory variable, xi is a vector of other determinants of
knowledge production, (γ,δ) a vector of parameters of interest and u i an error term.
We estimate the knowledge production equation (4) as two separate probit equations for the
process and product innovation indicators, by maximum likelihood in STATA. For the firms’
innovative effort ri* we take the predicted value from the estimated generalized Tobit equations (2)
and (3). That is, we estimate (4) for the sample of all firms, not only for the sub-sample of those
reporting R&D expenditures. By using its predicted value, we also instrument the innovative effort ri*
and take care that it is possibly endogenous to the knowledge production function. In other words, it
seems likely that characteristics of firms unobservable to us (and thus omitted) can make them both
increase their innovative effort and also their “innovativity” (i.e. their productivity in producing
innovations). This would mean that the γ parameters in (4) would be biased upward (because ri* and

u i would be positively correlated). The selection and innovative effort equations correct for this (as
long as wi and zi are independent of u i ).

19

Finally, firms produce output using constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas technology with
labour, capital and knowledge inputs so that,

yi = π 1ki + π 2 gi + vi ,

(5)

where output yi is labour productivity (log of output per worker), ki is the log of physical capital per
worker (proxied by physical investment per worker), and gi is knowledge input proxied by the
product and process innovation indicators. In our application we also include additional controls in
equation (5). We take care of the endogeneity of gi in this equation by using in the estimation the
predicted values from the knowledge production function equations (4).

In summary, our model consists of the four equations shown in equations (2), (3), (4) and (5).
Since we assume a recursive model structure and do not allow for feedback effects, we follow a
three-step estimation procedure. In the first step we estimate the generalized Tobit model (eqn. 2 and
3). In the second step, we separately estimate the two knowledge production functions for product
and process innovations as two probit equations using the predicted value of innovative effort from
the first step (to take care of both selectivity and endogeneity of ri* in eqn 4). In the last step, we
estimate the productivity equation using the predicted values from the second step (to take care of the
endogeneity of gi in eqn 5).

22

Appropriability conditions:
Formal protection: Dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the enterprise used design pattern,

trademarks or copyright to protect inventions or innovations during 1998-2000.
Strategic protection: Dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the enterprise used complexity of

design, secrecy or lead-time advantage on competitors to protect inventions or innovations during
1998-2000.
Cooperation: Dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the enterprise had some co-operative

arrangements on innovation activities during 1998-2000.

Other:
International competition: Dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the enterprise’s most

significant market is international.
Size: Set of size dummy variables according to the firm’s number of employees in 1998. Categories

are 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-999, >1000 employees.
Industry: Set of industry dummies according to the firm’s main business activity during the period

Notes: The averages are calculated as the geometric mean. The R&D intensity is the gross domestic expenditures on R&D
as a percentage of GDP. The growth of labour productivity is obtained by dividing the growth of value added at constant
prices by the growth of the labour force. The rate of multi–factor productivity growth is the part of GDP growth which is
not explained by the weighted average of the rates of growth of capital and labour inputs. The data are from OECD
(2005a, b).
