    "abstract": "\n\nIncentive schemes that reward participants based on their relative performance are often thought to be particularly risk-inducing. Using a novel, real-effort task experiment in the laboratory, we find that the relationship between incentives and risk-taking is more nuanced and depends critically on the availability of information about peers\u2019 strategies and outcomes. Indeed, we find that when no peer information is available, relative rewards schemes are associated with significantly less risk-taking than non-competitive rewards. In contrast, when decision-makers receive information about their peers\u2019 actions and/or outcomes, relative incentive schemes are associated with more risk-taking than non-competitive schemes. The nature of the feedback\u2014whether subjects receive information about peers\u2019 strategies, outcomes, or both\u2014also affects risk-taking. We find no evidence that competitors imitate their peers when they face only feedback about other subjects\u2019 risk-taking strategies. However, decision-makers take more risk when they see the gaps between their performance score and their peers\u2019 scores grow. Combined feedback about peers\u2019 strategies and performance\u2014from which subjects may assess the overall relationship between risk-taking and success\u2014is associated with more risk-taking when rewards are based on relative performance; we find no similar effect for non-competitive rewards.\n\n",
