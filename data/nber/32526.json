In this study, we develop a new semantic-distance-based algorithm to identify \u201cnew work,\u201d namely the new types of jobs introduced in the US. We characterize how \u201cnew work\u201d relates to task content of jobs and skill characteristics of workers and document its geographic distribution and association with employment growth.  Then, we analyze whether local factors associated in the previous literature with agglomeration economies and productivity growth as well as local exposures to global shocks\u2014technology, trade, immigration, and population aging\u2014predict the creation of \u201cnew work.\u201d  We find local supply of college educated in 1980 as the strongest predictor of \u201cnew work.\u201d Using the historical location of 4-year colleges, a strong instrument for local college share, we find a positive and significant causal effect of local supply of human capital on \u201cnew work.\u201d\n\n",
