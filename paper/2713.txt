THE EARLY HISTORY OF PRICE INDEX RESEARCH

ABSTRACT

The paper discusses five early approaches to the price (and quantity)

index number problem. The five approaches are:

(1) the fixed basket

approach; (ii) the statistical approach; (iii) the test or axiomatic approach;
(iv) the Divisia approach and (v) the economic approach.

The economic approach makes use of the assumption of optimizing behavior
under constraint and the approach is discussed under four subtopics:

(i)

basic theoretical definitions; (ii) the theory of bounds; (iii) exact index
numbers and (iv) econometric estimation of preferences.
The paper also discusses several topics raised by Jack Triplett in a
recent paper, including:

(i) the merits of the test approach to index number

theory, (ii) the chain principle and alternatives to it; (iii) the substitution
bias and (iv) the new good bias.
Although the paper is for the most part an extensive historical survey,

there are a few new results in section 8 on multilateral alternatives to the

chain principle. Also in section 6.3, it is shown that the Paasche, Laspeyres
and all superlative indexes will satisfy the circularity test to the first
order.

1. Introduction
In order to limit the size of his paper, Jack Triplett has chosen to
concentrate on the history of price measurement research during the last

three decades. The purpose of this paper is to discuss his survey and
augment it by presenting a brief overview of the ancient history of price
measurement.

Basically, Triplett takes the economic approach to index number theory

as being the correct approach. He distinguishes three main variants of the
economic approach: (I) the cost of living index; (ii) the output price
index and (iii) the input cost index.

Most of Triplett's review concentrates on three topics: (i) the likely
size of the substitution bias (which occurs when we use the Paasche or
Laspeyres price indexes to approximate the underlying true economic index);
(ii) the appropriateness of using either a Divisia (1926) index or a chain
index and (iii) the appropriate treatment of quality chanze in the

construction-of price and quantity indexes, which is otherwise known as the

n&

problem. The largest part of the Triplett paper is devoted to the

last topic. This part of the paper is extremely interesting in its own
right and is also valuable from the viewpoint of the history of the subject
since Triplett was not only an active researcher in hedonic quality
adjustment techniques1, but he was also (and still is) a civil servant and
thus was well positioned to comment on Statistical Agency reactions to new
measurement techniques.

My overall impression of the paper is quite favorable. Jack Triplett
is an empirically oriented economist who knows the underlying theoretical

literature very well. He has presented us with a survey of lasting value.

2

At this point, I would like to list some of his insights that I found

paticularly interesting or worthy of strong endorsement (points of
disagreement will be discussed later):
(i) .

With the exception of housing, consumer durables are treated as

if they were entirely consumed within the year of purchase. This treatment
is appropriate in the production accounts but it is not appropriate in the

consumer accounts. Along with Triplett, I believe that statistical
agencies should make available a rental price treatment of all major
categories of consumer durables as supplementary information to their

present series. A rental price treatment of purchases of new durable goods
would also affect our measure of savings: a consumer's purchase of a
durable should be decomposed into a user cost portion and a savings portion
and the latter part should be added to conventional savings.2
(ii) .

I

am basically sympathetic to his treatment of the continuous

time Divisia index. Triplett (1988, 32) points out that we have to
approximate the continuous time index by a discrete time approximation.

The problem is that there are many discrete approximations that are
available but Divisia's theory gives us no guidance as to the specific

functional form for the discrete approximation. I shall elaborate on this
point in section 5 below.
(iii).

I

strongly endorse Triplett's (1988, 30-82) comments on the

inadequacies of existing data on wages.3

(iv). Finally, Triplett's (1988, 77) comments on the problems caused
by inadequate documentation of official data series deserves to be
stressed.

3

We conclude this section by presenting art outline of the remainder of
this paper.

At least five distinct approaches to price and quantity measurement
(or index number theory) can be distinguished in the early literature on

the subject (i) the tabular standard (or the commodity standard or the
fixed basket approach); (ii) the statistical approach; (iii) the test
approach; (iv) the Divisia index approach and (v) the economic approach.
We shall discuss the history of each approach in turn in sections 2-6
below.

In sections 7 to 11 below, we shall discuss a number of issues that
are raised by a reading of Triplett's paper -

issues that are perhaps

somewhat controversial. Section 7 briefly discusses the merits of the test
approach to index number theory while section 8 presents an extended
discussion of the chain principle.

Sections 9 and 10 discuss the possible

magnitudes of the substitution bias and the new good bias respectively
while section 11 asks whether the theory of the cost of living index has
been exhausted.

Section 12 concludes with a list of recommendations directed towards
Statistical Agencies.

2. The Fixed Basket ADoroach
The essence of the fixed basket approach or the tabular standard may

be explained as follows. Suppose that there are N goods that consumers in
a location can purchase during two periods. In periods 1 and 2, the
relevant price vectors are p1 —

p)

and 2 —

p)

respectively. Suppose further (unrealistically) that the quantities
purchased of the N goods are constant during the two periods, with the

4
constant vector of purchases being defined as q a

(q1

Then a

natural measure of the average level of prices in period 2 relative to

period 1 is p2.q/p'.q where pt.q Z1 pq is the inner product of the
vectors Pt and q.

The above approach to price measurement has been independently

proposed by many people. The earliest known proposer of the method was
William Fleetwood, the Rishop of Ely, who wrote the book Chronicon

Preciosum in l7O7. The constant basket of goods he used to compare the
value of money (or conversely, the level of prices) for an Oxford student
of 1707 compared to an Oxford student of 1460 was 5 quarters of wheat, 4
hogsheads of beer and 6 yards of cloth.

Perhaps the next independent discovery of the tabular standard was

made by the Legislature of Massachusetts in 1780. An account of this
discovery is given by Willard Fisher (1913). A tabular standard was used
to index the pay of Eoldiers fighting in the Revolutionary War (a massive
inflation had drastically reduced the real value of the fixed nominal pay

of the soldiers). The constant quantity basket was S bushels of corn, 68
and 4/7 pounds of beef, 10 pounds of sheep's wool and 16 pounds of sole
leather.

5

Joseph Lowe (1823,316) was not an independent discoverer of the
constant basket index number formula

)

p •q/p •q,

since he explicitly refers to Fleetwood's book. However, he developed the
concept in such detail that he should be considered the father of the

consumer price index. Lowe was well aware that the constant basket of

5

commodities q could vary across demographic groups; on page 332, he
presented some representative family budgets for cottagers and for the

middle class. On page 97 of the Appendix, he noted that price indexes may
be required for other classes of consumers or producers such as farmers and
miners while on page 336 of the main text, he advocated the construction of
separate "standards" for the labouring class, decomposed. into unmarried

labourers and married labourers dth 2,3, or 4 children. Finally, Lowe
(1823,33) also envisaged a national "table of reference" which would price
out a constant national consumption vector at the prices of each year t and
on pages 94 and 95 of the Appendix, he constructed two such hypothetical
tables.

How would the constant vector of commodities q in (1) be determined?
Lowe (1823, Appendix 95) answered this question as follows:

"As to quantity, a variation can take place only with increase of
of population or change of habits, and any alteration of that
kind must be so gradual, that we run very little hazard in
assuming a similarity of amount during a given period, which for
the sake of precision, we shall suppose to be five years."
Lowe (1823,334) also proposed that the national government should fund
the collection of the relevant price and quantity statistics, but if this
was not done, the Lowe felt that government agencies should at least
provide what data they had at their disposal "on the demand of any
respectable association."

Lowe (1823,335-343) listed a host of applications for his proposed
tables of reference, including the following: (i) wages, salaries and rents
could be indexed to eliminate the anomalies arising out of unforeseen

6

fluctuations in the value of the country's currency, (ii) they would
facilitate salary negotiations, (iii) they could be used to index long term
agricultural leases and (iv) bond holders could be paid in real terms if
-

they wanted that option.

Lowe (1823346) concluded with some pertinent observations on why his
proposal had not been implemented up to his time:
"This has, we believe, been owing to two causes; the

unfortunate neglect of political economy in the education of our
public men; and the interest of governxaent, the greatest of all

debtors, to prevent the public from fixing its attention on the
gradual depreciation of money that went on during the half
century to the late peace.

Scrope (1833,406-407) followed in Lowe's footsteps but was the first
to use the term tabular standard to describe the price index defined by

(1). However, his treatment was not nearly as detailed as that of Lowe6,
so we will pass on to list others who have endorsed the tabular standard.

If quantities were to remain constant during the two periods under
consideration, a whole host of authors endorsed formula (1) to measure
price change, including Jevons (1865,l22)(1.884,l22), Sidgwick (1883,67-68)

Edgeworth (l925,2l2) (originally published in 1887), Marshall (1887,363),
Rowley (1899)(1901,227)(1928,223), Walsh (1901,540), (1921,543) (1924,544)

and Pigou (1912,38). During this period, the precise specification of the
constant quantity vector q was a problem which was addressed. Thus
Laspeyres (1871) proposed that q should equal q1 —

(q

qj), the base

period quantity vector, while Paasche (1874) proposed that q should equal
—
q), the current period quantity vector. Thus (1) can be

and

-

Given that quantities would not be exactly equal during the two
periods under consideration, various authors started to argue that averages

of (2) and (3) should be used to measure price change. Thus Sidgwick

(1883,68) and Rowley (1901,227) proposed the use of 112L +

(l/2)P

while Edgeworth (1925,214) (originally published in 1887) proposed that the
q in (1) be set equal to the arithmetic average of the two quantity

vectors, (1/2)q1 +

(l/2)q2,

(Edgeworth states that this variant was also

independently proposed by Alfred Marshall). Rowley (1899) suggested the

Walsh (1901,398) proposed that the components q. of the quantity
vector q in (1) should be set equal to the geometric means of the

quantities in the two periods. Thus the Walsh price index is

Finally, Pigou (1912,46) suggested PLPPa5 a measure of price change.
Since this price index has rather poor homogeneity properties, Pigou later

8

modified his measure by taking the square root which yields F defined by
(4); see Pigou (1932,69).

At this stage, the fixed basket approach to index number theory merged
into the test and economic approaches.

3.

The Statistical Approach.

This approach, which originated with Jevons (1965)(1884), assumed that

increases in the supply of money increased all prices proportionately

except for random fluctuations. Thus with additive errors and a sufficient
number of independent observations, an appropriate price index could be

obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the price ratios p/p while with
multiplicative errors, an appropriate price index could be obtained by

taking the geometric mean of the price ratios. This second alternative was
advocated by Jevons, and thus we obtain the Jevons price index

"i—l

In addition to Jevons, two other prominent economists who advocated
the statistical approach to index numbers were Sowley (1901,223226) (1921,202),(1928,217-223) and Edgeworth (1888)(1896)(l9Ol)(l923)

(1925)8. Edgeworth mainly advocated the median of the price ratios
as the best estimator of price change.

The statistical approach was criticized by Irving Fisher (1911,194.
196) who explained in an absolutely convincing manner why all prices cannot
move proportionately (due to the existence of fixed price contracts, for

example). Fisher's criticisms were ignored by the profession as were those
of Walsh (1924). However, Keynes (1930,71-81) effectively demolished the

9

naive statistical approach by constructing various tables of index numbers
which showed systematic differences over time and hence the hypothesis of
approximate proportional change in all prices could not be maintained

empirically.9 Bowley (1928;221) also criticized the approach on narrower
statistical grounds by indicating that the price movements were not
statistically independent.

Although Jevons' naive statistical approach is no longer advocated, as
was indicated in Triplett's (1988) paper, statistical sampling of the

prices of the various components of a price index is still done today. A
problem with many of these sampling procedures is that prices are sampled

independently of quantities. Pigou (1932,77) was perhaps the first to
propose that values should be sampled in the two periods under
consideration, along with the corresponding prices and quantities, and then
the Fisher ideal index

defined by (4) should be used to construct a

measure of price change over the commodities in the sample of values. This
sample price index could then be used to deflate the population value ratio

over the two periods. Pigou's proposal deserves serious consideration by
Statistical Agencies even today.

4.

The Test Ayyroach
The origins of the test approach are rooted in the more or less casual

observation of the early workers in the index number field on their
favorite index number formulae or those of their competitors.

Thus Jevons (1884,152) (originally published in 1865) recognized that
his unweighted geometric mean formula (6) gave index number comparisons-

between any two years that were independent of the base year. Edgeworth

(1896,137) gave a clear general treatment of this ka

invariance tesJ°

10

which we can phrase as follows. Let (pO,ptq0,qt) be a generic index
number formula of the type defined by (2) to (5) above which compares the
level of prices in period t to the level of prices in period U, the base

year. Let p and qt be the price and quantity vectors pertaining to year t

for c—UI

T. Let i, s and t denote arbitrary years. With the base

year equal to 0, the level of prices in year t relative to s is taken to be

0 tOt OsOs If we change the base to year i, then the

P(p ,p ,q ,q )/P(p ,p ,q ,q ).

level of prices in period t relative to s is p(p1,pt,q1,qt)/p(p1,p5,q1,q5),
The base invariance test demands that these tt.,ro numbers be equal; i.e.,
that

(7)

Us,p ,qUs
P(pUt
,p ,q Ut
,q )/P(p
,q )

— P(p

it
it
,p ,q ,q
)/P(pisis
,p ,q ,q ).

Our next test was first proposed by Laspeyres (1871,308), and has come
to be known as the strong identity

if prices in the two periods under

consideration remain constant, then even if the quantities change11, the
level of prices should remain unchanged; i.e., •we should have

(8)

p(ppqLq2) —

1

where P denotes the index number formula or function,

denotes the common price vector in both periods and qt
denotes the quantity vector in period t for t —

(Pi''
(q

q)

1,2.

The statistician Westergaard (1890.218-219) formulated what later12

became known as the circularity

the bilateral index number formula

should satisfy the following equation:

(9)

1212 2323 1313

P(p ,p ,q ,q )P(p ,p ,q ,q ) — P(p ,p ,q ,q )

11

where Pt and qt are the price and quantity vectors pertaining to periods t
for t —

1,2,3.

The right hand side of (9) computes the price level in

period 3 relative to the price level in period 1 in one step, using the

bilateral index number formula or function P The left hand side of (9)
computes the level of prices in period 3 relative to period 1 in two steps:

in the first step, we use the bilateral formula p(p1 p2 q1q2) to compute
the level of prices in period 2 relative to period 1 and then in the second
step, we use the bilateral formula P(p2,p3,q21q3) to compute the level of

prices in period 3 relative to period 2. The product of these two steps is
supposed to yield the level of prices in period 3 relative to period 1.
The Dutch economist Pierson (1896) informally proposed two tests: (i)
invariance to changes in the units of measurement (which Irving Fisher
(l911)(1922,420) first called the change of units test and later called the

commensurability test) and (ii) the time reversal test which can be stated
mathematically as follows:

2121

(10)

P(p ,p ,q ,q )

— l/P(p

1212

,p ,q ,q ).

Up to this point in time, research or the test or axiomatic approach

to index number theory was rather casual and unsystematic. The first
systematic researcher on the axiomatic approach was Walsh
(l9Ol)(192l)(1924) who proposed a number of tests, including the constant
quantities

i.e., if quantities remain fixed at the vector q during

the two periods under consideration, then the appropriate formula for the
price index is

(11)

12

2

1

P(p ,p ,q,q) — p •q/p •q.

12

Another test proposed by Walsh was the strong proportionality (in
prices)

i.e.,

if A is a positive scaler and prices in period 2 are

equal to A times the corresponding prices in period 1, then

14

P(plAplqlq2) — A.

(12)

A final test proposed by Walsh (1901,389)(l921,540)(1924,506) was his

multiperiod identity test15 i.e., the bilateral index number function P is
to satisfy the following functional equation;

(13)

2323
3131
P(p1212
,p ,q ,q )P(p
p ,q .q )P(p
'p ,q ,q )

Note that

the prices and quantities in period 4 are exactly equal to the

— 1

prices and quantities in period 1, p1 and q1 respectively. As we shall see
later, the test (13) will be useful in evaluating the usefulness of the
chain principle.

The next major contributor to the test approach is Irving Fisher

(l911)(l921)(l922). Since Fisher's contributions to the test approach are
quite well known (in fact, he is often credited with inventing the

approach), we will not review his contributions in any detail. However, we
do wish to make two comments about his work.

Our first conent is to note that Fisher (1911,403) seems to have been
the first to observe that the choice of a functional form P(p1,p2,q1,q2)

for a price index implicitly determines the functional form for the
corresponding quantity index Q(p11p21q1,q2); i.e., the product of the two
indexes should equal the value ratio for the two periods under

consideration. Thus given P, Q is implicitly determined by the following
equation:

13

1212 Q(p1212
2211
,p ,q ,q ) — p •q /p •q

P(p p ,q ,q )

(14)

Frisch

(1930,399) called (14) the product .at

while

Samuelson and Swarny

(1974,572) called it the weak factor reversal, as•
Our second comment about Fisher's contributions to the test approach
is relatively unknown. Fisher (1922,140) explained how to 'rectify" an
arbitrary bilateral index number formula p(pl,p2,ql,q2) so that the

rectified formula * would satisfy the time reversal test (10): simply
define '* as follows:

1212

(15)

P*(p ,p ,q ,q )

Fisher's

*

1212 21211/2

(F(p ,p ,q ,q )/P(p ,p ,q .q )]

time rectification procedure indeed does work as advertised: the

defined

by (15) will satisfy (10). The only problem is that the

procedure is clearly due to Walsh (1921,542), who was a discussant for
Fisher's (1921) paper which was a preview for Fisher (1922).

Unfortunately, Fisher's (1922,183) historical comments on the rectification

principle fail to mention Walsh at all. However, on the positive side,
Fisher (1922.396-398) generalized Walsh's basic idea by showing how an
index number formula could also be rectified to satisfy Fisher's factor
reversal fl.at16 or be rectified to simultaneously satisfy the factor and
time reversal tests.

Frisch (1930)(l936,5-7) effectively criticized the test approach to
index number theory on the grounds that it could be shown that no bilateral
index number formula P(p1,p2,q1,q2) could satisfy all reasonable tests or
axioms17 and when some tests were dropped so as to achieve a consistent set

14

of tests, there was no general agreement on which subset of tests should be

dropped. Hence the test approach did not seem to lead anywhere.
In recent years, the test approach has sprung to life again, largely
due to the efforts of Wolfgang Eichhorn (l973)(1976) and his students and
18

colleagues.

5.

The Divisia Approach.

Divisia's (1926,39-40) derivation of the price and quantity indexes

associated with his name can be summarized as follows. Let the prices
N, be functions of (continuous)

pjt) and the quantities q.(t), i—l

time t and let expenditure at time t be the value v(t)

p.(t)qjt).

Assuming differentiability, the rate of change of value at time t is:

(16)

p.(dq./dt)

dv(t)/dt —

+

q.(dp./dt).

Divisia then divided both sides of (16) by p(t).q(t)

pjt)q.(t) and

equated the right hand side of the resulting equation to Q'(t)/Q(t) ÷
P'(t)/P(t) where Q(t) and P(t) are aggregate quantity and price levels
pertaining to period t and Q'(t) and P'(t) denote their time derivatives.
Thus we have:

(17)

—l 1q'(t) ÷

qp.'(t) —

v(t)

v(t)

Q'(t)

+ P'(t)

Q(t)

P(t)

Djvisja then defined Q(t) and P(t) as solutions to the following
differential equations:

(18)

Q'(t) —
Q(t)

•

1

(t)q'(t)

p(t).q(t)

; P'(t) —
P(t)

1

q(t)p'1(t)
p(t).q(t)

15

Somewhat surprisingly, virtually the same derivation was made earlier
by the English economist, T.L. Rennet (1920,461), except that he did not
divide (16) through by v(t) —

p(t)'q(t).

The above derivation of the Divisia indexes is very mechanical and is

unrelated to economics (i.e., choice under constraint). However, later
both yule (1946) and 1-lulten (1973) related the Divisia indexes to economic

price and quantity indexes under the assumptions of optimizing behavior and
a linearly homogenous aggregator function.'9
Triplett (1988) observes, the problem with the Divisia approach to
price measurement is that we generally cannot observe prices and quantities

continuously. Thus the continuous time Divisia indexes must be
approximated using discrete time data and there are many ways of forming
discrete time approximations to say P(2)/P(1)20, where P(t) is the Divisia
index for time period t defined by (18) (plus an initial normalization).
Diewert (1980,444-445) showed that the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes,

and P, defined by (2) and (3) above, could be regarded as discrete time

approximations to P(2)/P(l) as could the Tornqvist-translog T defined by

in P(p1p2q1.q2) a

where the shares

Since the indexes L'

N.

and T can differ considerably, the Divisia

approach does not lead to a practical resolution of the price measurement
21
problem.

To conclude this section on the Zennet-Divisia approach, we note that
Rennet (1920,457) suggested the following discrete approximations to

16

measure differences (rather than the ratios of Divisia) in the aggregate
price and quantity levels:

(20)

— P(2) — P(1) —

Z1

(21)

— Q(2) — Q(1) —

-l

(1/2)(q+q)(p—pb

(l/2)(pi-p?)(q?—q

Bennet also showed that the difference in expenditures for the two periods,

z1

p?q? —

z p}q},

was exactly equal to AP+LQ, where AP and Q are

defined by the right hand sides of (20) and (2l).22
6.

The Economic Approach.

The economic approach to index number theory23 relies on the
assumption of optimizing behavior on the part of economic agents: utility
maximizing or expenditure minimizing behavior on the part of consumers and
profit maximizing or cost minimizing behavior on the part of producers.
The first two papers to use an explicit utility maximizing framework
appear to be by Bennet (1920) and Kon'üs (1924). Bennet's paper drew on an
earlier paper by Bowley (1919) (he used Bowley's notation and data) and may
be regarded as an attempt to determine the approximate magnitude of the
substitution bias using the assumption of an quadratic utility function.
Bowley (1928,226)(1938) was in turn influenced by Bennet and developed his

own quadratic approximations. Bennet's paper was very short and sketchy
and did not have the impact that the KonUs paper eventually had. KonUs
(1924,16-18) not only presented a very clear definition of the true cost of
living for an individual optimizing consumer, he also developed the now

well known Paasche and Laspeyres bounds.24 Kodüs (1924,20-21) also showed
that the Paasche and Laspeyres price indexes, (3) and (2) above, bound the

17

true cost of living index even in the general nonhomothetic preferences
case, provided that we evaluate the true index at a suitable utility level
that is between the base and current period levels.
To complete our brief survey of the early history of the economic
approach to index number theory, we shall review the economic approach
under four subdivisions: (i) basic theoretical definitions, (ii) the theory
of bounds, (iii) exact index numbers and (iv) econometric approaches.

6.1 Basic Theoretical Definitions
As Triplett (1988) noted, there are three main branches of price index

theory. (i) For the true cost of living index, see Kcrs (1924), Sarnuelson
(1947,156) and Pollak (1971). For related quantity indexes,, see Rowley

(1928230), Allen (1949), Malmquist (1953) and Pollak (1971).

(ii) For

theoretical definitions of the output price index, see Hicks (1940), Fisher
and Shell (1972), Sainuelson and Swamy (1974;588-592), Archibald (1977) and

Diewert (198Th). For related quantity indexes, see Rowley (1921,203),
Bergson (1961,31-34), Moorsteen (1961), Fisher and Shell (1972,53),
Sarnuelson and Sway (1974,588-591), Sato (1976,438) and Hicks (1981,256).
(iii) The input cost index is defined by Triplett (1983a,274) and Diewert
(1980,459) and corresponding quantity indexes are defined in Diewert
(1980,456-460).

There is a fourth branch of price index theory not mentioned by

Triplett: (iv) constant utility income deflators. On this last branch of
theoretical index number theory, see Diewert and Bossons (1987).

18

6.2 The Theory of Bounds
Observable bound to the generally unobservable economic price and
quantity indexes were first worked out by Pigou (1912,44-46)(l932,62-63)
and Haberler (1927,78-92) independently of Kontis (1924,17-19)

o

established the Paasche and Laspeyres bounds for the true cost of living.

For a generalization of these bounds to nonlinear budget constraints, see

Frisch (l936,l8).25 It is clear that a large portion of revealed
preference theory that is often attributed to Hicks (1940) and Samuelson
(1947,157) had already been developed by Pigou, Kon'ds, Haberler and Frisch.

Other researchers who established bounds on true indexes in the two
observation situation include Leontief (1936,49), Friedman (1938,125),
Allen (1949), Malrnquist (1953), Moorsteen (1961,464), Pollak (1971), Fisher

and Shell (1972,57-62), Samuelson and Swamy (1974,581-591), Archibald
(1975) and Dietert (l9Sl,l57-l79)(1983a,173-2lO)(l983b,l056-lO9O)

The above theory of bounds all pertains to the two observation
situation. Afriat (1967) (1977) generalized the two observation theory to
cover the many observation case.

6.3 Exact Index Numbers
Let an aggregator function26 f(q) be given where q is an N dimensional

quantity vector; i.e., q —

The

(q1

function C which is

generated by f may be defined as

(22)

C(u,p) —

minq

(p.q

f(q)

u)

i.e., C(u,p) is the solution to the problem of minimizing the cost p•q —

of

achieving at least the utility (or output) level u, where p

19

an exogenous vector of prices facing the consumer (or
producer).

An index number formula or function P(p,p2,q1,q2) of the type we
considered in section 4 is defined to be exact27 for an aggregator function
f if

(23)

1212

P(p p ,q ,q )

2

C(u,p )/C(u,p

1

t

t

for some utility or output level u where q solves (22) when pp for
t=l,2; i.e. •

P

is exact for f (or its dual cost function C) if P equals the

relevant economic index under the assumption of optimizing behavior on the

part of an economic agent using the aggregator function f. The right hand
side of (23) is PK(pl,p2,u), the KonUs price index or true cost of living
index for a consumer that has the utility function f and faces the vector
of prices Pt in period t for t—l,2.

The English language literature on exact index numbers has its roots

in the theory of quadratic approximations. As we indicated earlier, Rennet
(1920,460) attempted to determine an appropriate index number formula for
the true cost of living of a single "satisfaction' maximizing consumer
under the hypothesis that the underlying utility function f(q) was a

general quadratic function. Rowley (1928,226)(1938) followed up on
Rennet's approach and provided his own second order approximation. Frisch
(1936,27-29) criticized Rowley's index number formula and developed an

alternative formula which he called the double expenditure method. Wald
(1939,329) and Balk (1981,1556) correctly pointed out that Frisch's index
number formula was

exact for a general quadratic utility function.

However, Frisch (1936,29-30) did correctly show28 that his index number

20

formula collapsed to the Fisher ideal price index

hornothetic quadratic preferences so that f(q) a

assumed
q•Aq

defined by (4) if one

where A a

[a.. ] is

!1

a..q.q, a

a symmetric N by N matrix of parameters that

characterize tastes. This is an early example of an exact index number
formula.
Another early example was given by Raid (l939)(l939,325) who assumed
the following general quadratic aggregator function:

f(q) a a0 +

(24)

where a0, a a [d1

a'q

÷ (l/2)q-Aq

dN] and A a 1a1I are respectively a parameter, a

vector of parameters and a symmetric N by N matrix of parameters.

Unfortunately, in order to evaluate Raid's general index number
formula

that is exact

for (24), information on income elasticities is

required (we shall not write out his general index number formula since it
is rather complex). However, if we assume hornothetic preferences again
(i.e., the aggregator function is a monotonically increasing function of a
linearly homogeneous function) so that a0 — 0 and a —

in (24)29 then all

of the consuner's income elasticities equal unity and Wald's general index

number formula collapses down to the Fisher price index (4) and again we
obtain the exact index number result of Frisch,3°
Unknown to the above authors, the Frisch-cjald exact index number

result had already been obtained by KonUs and Byushgens (1926,167-172) a

decade earlier,31 In this remarkable paper, they introduced duality theory
into the economics literature; i.e, they expressed consumer preferences not
only by the direct utility function f(q) but also by the corresponding
indirect utility function g defined as follows:

21
(25)

max (f(q) : p•q

g(p,y)

yl

i.e., the indirect utility function g(p,y) gives the maximum utility
attainable as a function of the prices faced by the consumer p —

(p1

and the income or expenditure y 0 to be spent on the N goods during
the period under consideration. Kon'ds and Byushgens assumed that the
direct utility function f was linearly homogeneous in which case the
indirect utility function g can be expressed as follows in terms of the
unit cost function c(p) a

g(p,y) —

(26)

C(1,p)

where C(u,p) was defined by (22) above:

y/c(p).

Konlls and Byushgens considered three classes of homothetic preferences

which were defined via the indirect utility function g(p,y) or
equivalently, using (26), via the unit cost function c(p).

The first case they considered had the following unit cost function:

c(p) a

(27)

!1 a.p.

,

a. > 0,

i—I

N.

As is well known32, the dual direct utility function is the fixed
coefficient or no substitution f defined as follows:

(28)

— min.( q./a. : i —

1

N)

Under these conditions, KonUs and Byushgens (1926,162) showed that the

Laspeyres and Paasche indexes, L and

exactly

defined by (2) and (3) above, will -

equal the true cost of living (defined by the right hand side of

(23) for any positive utility level u), provided that the consumer's direct
utility function is defined by (26) and (27).

22

The second case they considered was the case of Cobb-Douglas

preferences33 which can be characterized by the following unit cost
function:

c(p) a a

(29)

iif_,1

pi

,

cz.>O

—l a.— 1

KonUs and Byushgens (1926,165) showed that the generalized Jevons index
defined by (6) (except that 1/N is replaced by a.) is exact for these
Wicksell-Cobb-Douglas preferences, where the unknown parameters a. can be
determined as follows: a. —

pq/pt.qt

,

the ith expenditure share, i1,

N, for any period t.

In

the final case considered by KonUs and Byushgens (1926,168), the

consumer's preferences were characterized by the following unit cost
function:

(30)

c(p)

(p8)1"2 —

(Z':_i

Z1 b..p.p.)1'2

S a [bi.] is a symmetric N by N matrix of unknown parameters that
characterize preferences. They showed that the Fisher ideal index
where

defined by (4) was exact for the preferences characterized by (26) and

(30). KonUs and Byushgens (1926,171) also showed that if the inverse of
the matrix 8 existed, say A —

81,

then the direct utility function

corresponding to (26) and (30) was

(31)

f(q) —

(q'Aq)1'2

which is a monotonic transformation of the
function considered by Frisch and tJald.

homogeneous quadratic utility

23

Finally, RonUs and Byushgens (1926,171) exhibited both the system of
inverse demand functions, p/y — Aq/q.Aq, and the system of ordinary demand
functions, q —

y8p/p.Rp, that correspond to the homogeneous quadratic

preferences defined by (31). They also suggested that the unknown
parameters appearing in the A or B matrices could be determined given a

sufficient number of price and quantity observations. However, note that a
knowledge of A or B is !32t required in order to evaluate the Fisher price
index

After the contributions of Bowley, Frisch and Wald to the theory of
exact index numbers, the subject remained dormant until Afriat (1972,4447), Pollak (1971,117-132) and Samuelson and Swamy (1974,573-574)

reexamined the subject. All of these authors examined the three cases
considered by KonUs and Byushgens and some other cases as well.

1212

Diewert (1976,134) defined a price index function P(p p ,q ,q )

to

be

superlative if P was exact for preferences which had a cost function C(u,p)

—

uc(p)

where c(p) is a unit cost function that could provide a second

order approximation to an arbitrary twice continuously differentiable

linearly homogeneous function. The idea was that a superlative index
number formula P(p11p2,q1,q2), which could be evaluated using only
observable price and quantity data for the two periods under consideration,

would correspond to a flexible functional form for a unit cost function

c(p). For example, P defined by (4) is a superlative price index since it
is exact for the c defined by (30) and this c has the required second order

approximation property. Another example of a superlative index is the
Walsh index P defined by (5) since it is exact for the unit cost function
which is dual to the aggregator function

24

q) —

a. .q.1'12 q)"2; see Diewert (1976,132). A third example

of a superlative price index is 'T defined by (19) which is exact for a
translog unit cost function;34 see Diewert (1976,121).

Unfortunately, Diewert (1976) defined two (infinite) families of
superlative index number formulae and this raised the question as to which

formula should be used in empirical applications. Fortunately, Diewert
(1978) showed that all choices of a superlative formulae gave the same
answer to the second order and hence the choice was usually immaterial.

More precisely, Diewert showed that every known superlative index number

formula P(p1,p2,q1q2) had the same first and second derivatives when
evaluated at equal prices (i.e., p1'-.p2) and equal quantities (i.e.,
2

35

q ).

As an interesting footnote to the history of economic thought, it

should be noted that Diewert was not the first to use the above second
order approximation technique; Edgeworth (1901,410-411) used a variant of
it to show that the Walsh index

defined by (5) approximated to the

second order the Edgeworth (1925,213) -

Marshall

(1887,372) index defined

as follows:

(32)

P(p1,p2,q',q2) a (

(l/2)(q÷q)p)/[E71 (l/2)(q}+q?)p].

The Taylor series expansion technique around an equal price and
quantity point was used again by Edgeworth (1923,347) to show that the
Laspeyres index

defined by (2) and the Fisher index

defined by (4)

satisfy the circularity test (9) to the first order. Since this
Proposition seems to have been forgotten, we sketch a proof of it.

25

Let the index number function P be either L or P1 and define the
functions £ and g as follows:

1212
2323
,p ,q ,q )P(p ,p ,q ,q
f(p123123
p 'p ,q ,q ,q ) — P(p

(33)

123123 1313

g(p ,p ,p ,q ,q ,q ) — P(p ,p ,q ,q ).

For

or for P—P1, it can be verified that the following equalities

hold:

123123 123123

where

df/dpN] is the vector of first order partial derivatives of £

with respect to the components of p', etc. The meaning of (34) is that the
functions f and g approximate each other to the first order when evaluated

at an equal price and quantity point. Thus the Laspeyres and Fisher price
indexes satisfy the circularity test to the first order.

Using the results in Diewert (1978,898) and the results in the above
paragraph, it can be shown that the Paasche, Laspeyres and all superlative

26

index number formulae will similarly satisfy the circularity test to the
first order.

Note that Edgeworth's Proposition helps to explain Fisher's (1922,280)
empirical finding that

satisfied the circularity test to a very high

degree of approximation.

6.4 Econometric Estimation of Preferences
In this variant of the economic approach to index numbers, the
parameters

that characterize consumer preferences are estimated.

Preferences may be represented by: (i)

the

direct utility function; (ii)

the indirect utility function; (iii) the distance function36 or (iv) the

cost or expenditure function. Once any one of these functions in known,
the other three functions can be calculated, at least in principle. In
particular, the cost function C(u,p) can be calculated and hence the Konlis

price index defined by the right hand side of (23) can be calculated.

Triplett (1988) gives an excellent summary of most of the post 1948
research in this area; additional references to the recent literature can
be found in chapter 7 of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980).
It seems appropriate to add a few references to the early history of
this approach to index number theory.
The

earliest effort at a strategy for determining the parameters which

characterize preferences was made by Bennec (1920,462). He assumed a

quadratic direct utility function and showed how the consumer's system of
demand functions could be obtained in the three good case (although he did

not quite exhibit a closed form solution). He then made some comments on
how many observations would be required in the general N good case in order

27

to determine all 1 + N +

(l/2)N(N+l)

of the parameters of the quadratic

utility function f(q) defined by (24).

37

We have already seen that Kontis and Byushgens (1926) were contributors

to the econometric approach, since they derived the demand functions
corresponding to Cobb-Douglas preferences and homogeneous quadratic
preferences. Kontis and Byushgens (1926,172) noted that one price-quantity
observation would suffice to determine the parameters of Cobb-Douglas
preferences while (N-t-l)/2 observations would be required to determine all

N(N+l)/2 parameters for the homogeneous quadratic functional forms, (30) or

(31). They also noted that statistical determination of the homogeneous
quadratic preferences would be difficult.

Another early contributor to the econometric approach to index numbers
was Wald (1937)(l939,325), who assumed quadratic preferences; recall (24).

In addition he assumed that the demand functions regarded as functions of
income (or expenditure) were known functions for the two periods under

consideration. (Alternatively, just a knowledge of the income elasticities
of demand at the two observed price and quantity points would suffice).

With these assumptions, Wald was able to derive an exact index number
formula, so his approach is actually a blend of the exact and econometric
approaches.

Wald's blended approach seems worthy of further study. However, the

pxg econometric

approach has severe limitations. The problem with the

latter approach is that in order to provide a second order approximation to
general preferences, we require approximately 142/2 parameters in the N good

case. Since N is perhaps equal to 50,000 for a typical consumer (a
supermarket alone has 15,000 to 20,000 separate items), the required number

28

of parameters to be estimated is approximately 1.25 billion, which would
require price and quantity observations for about 25,000 periods.38

This concludes our survey of the ancient history of index numbers. We
turn now to a discussion of some of the more controversial issues raised by
Triplett.

7.

On the Test Approach to Index Number Theory
Triplett (1988) does not discuss the test approach to index number

theory and perhaps the reader may well feel that this is quite appropriate

due to the length of his paper. Although I am basically in agreement with
Triplett that the economic approach to index number theory is the most

compelling approach, it should be mentioned that the test approach has some

advantages. In particular, the test approach does not suffer from the
following limitations of the economic approach: (i) the economic approach

is based on optimizing behavior an assumption which may not be warranted
in general; (ii) the economic approach generally relies on separability
assumptions39 about the underlying aggregator functions, assumptions which
are unlikely to be true in general and (iii) in deriving capital rental
prices, the economic approach is usually based on an ex ante expectations
about future prices, expectations which cannot be observed, whereas the
test approach can be based on ex post accounting data, which can be
observed

8.

40

On the Chain PrinciDle and Multilateral Indexes.

Triplett (1988) contrasts the chain orincinle with the fixed ka

orincitle

for constructing a series of index numbers which extends over

three or more periods. Given price and quantity data,

i—1,2,3 for

29

three periods and a bilateral price index function P(p1,p2,q',q2) that

depends only on the data for two periods, the fixed ka sequence of
aggregate price levels for the 3 periods would be

(35)

1212 1313

1, P(p p ,q ,q ), P(p ,p .q ,q

while the chain sequence of price levels would be

(36)

1212 1212 2323

1, P(p ,p ,q ,q ), P(p ,p ,q ,q )P(p ,p ,q ,q ).

Historically, the fixed base principle was the first to be used

empirically. In the English language literature, the chain principle was
first proposed by Alfred Marshall (1887,373)41. basically as a method for
overcoming the difficulties in comparing prices over two distant periods,
due to the invention of new commodities.42

Irving Fisher (1911,203), who gave the chain system its name, noted
that the chain system was invariant to changes in the base period and he
also saw the advantage of the method in dealing with the new good problem
as the following quotation indicates43:
"It may be said that the cardinal virtue of the successive base
or chain system is the facility it affords for the introduction of new
commodities, the dropping out of obsolete commodities, and the
continued readjustment of the system of weighting to new commodities."
(Fisher, 1911,204).

While it is true that the use of the chain principle has an advantage
in dealing with the introduction of new commodities, it has the following
severe disadvantage noted by Triplett (1988): it does not satisfy Walsh's

Multiperiod Identity Test, (13) above.44 Thus as Triplett shows, if prices

30

and quantities systematically oscillate around constant values, the use of

the chain method will give biased results. This same point has been made
by Szulc (1983) and Hill (1988).

The above difficulty with the chain method was not adequately
appreciated by Diewert (1978,895) who argued for the use of the chain
principle on the grounds that it would reduce the spread between the
Laspeyres and Paasche indexes, (2) and (3) above, and between all known
superlative indexes, since price and quantity changes will generally be

smaller between adjacent periods than between distant periods. He argued
that the spread between the Paasche and Laspeyres indexes would be greater

than between the superlative indexes because L and P only approximate
each other to the first order, while superlative indexes approximate each
other to the second order (recall our discussion of the Edgeworth second

order approximation technique in section 6.3 above). Diewert (1978,894)
also presented the results of some numerical experiments using Canadian per
capita consumption data for 13 commodity classes over the years 1947-1971.

These results showed that the chain method did in fact lead to a smaller
spread between

defined by (2LP defined by (,

defined

by (4) and

defined by (19) than when a fixed base year, 1947, was used,

Although the chain method will give poor results with oscillating
data, Szulc (1983) and Hill (1988) show theoretically that chaining will
tend to reduce the spread between the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes,

provided that prices and quantities trend monotonically over the time

periods in question. Thus Diewert's (1978,894) empirical results could be
rationalized by the hypothesis that monotonic trends in the data outweighed
oscillatory movements.

31

While the chain system fails to satisfy Walsh's Identity Test (13),
Hill (1988) shoded that the fixed base system fails to satisfy an analogue

to the Strong Identity Test (8). Consider the base period to be period 0
and suppose that the bilateral price and quantity indexes, P and Q

respectively, are given and they satisfy the Product Test (14). Then under
the fixed base system, price P* and quantity Q* comparisons between periods
t

and t+l are made as follows:

The problem is that P* and Q* need not satisfy counterparts of (8) even if
the underlying bilateral indexes P and Q do satisfy (8); i.e., it will not
generally be the case that

normally used in the national accounts, as an example of a

fixed base index which generates a P* which fails to satisfy the Hill
Identity Test (39)

Thus both the chain and the fixed base systems fail

to satisfy theoretically appropriate identity tests.

We turn now to a discussion of possible alternatives to the use to

either the fixed base or chain systems. The first person to propose
alternatives was Walsh (1901,431), but it is convenient to start our
discussion by reviewing some proposals due to Irving Fisher (1922,297-320).

32

Fisher's (1922,298) first alternative was to list each and every
possible binary comparison and thus the index number user could simply pick

out the binary comparisons of interest. Let us (unimaginatively) call this

the j] binary comparisons method. Fisher actually implemented this method
for his data on 36 primary commodities for 6 years using the Fisher ideal

defined by (4). Thus there were 6(6—1) — 30 bilateral

price index

comparisons. Fisher (1922,301) then used these bilateral comparisons to
determine whether the Base Invariance Test (7) was satisfied to a high
degree of approximation:46 in Fisher's (1922,302) words, "the differences

due to differences of base are trifling."
However, Fisher (1922,299-305) recognized that it was not practical or
worthwhile to list every possible binary comparison: for twenty periods,

there would be 380 separate index numbers. Thus Fisher was led to other
classes of alternatives to the use of either the fixed base or the chain
systems, which we will call multiperiod systems, or in the context of

regional comparisons, multilateral systems. If there are data for T
periods, these multilateral methods make use of the data for all T periods
simultaneously to construct a series of T price levels and T quantity
levels.

Fisher's (1922,305) first cnultiperiod or multilateral method was the

blend system, which works as follows. Suppose we have price and quantity
data, Pt —

(p

p) and qt (q

q) for t—l,2

T and a

bilateral index number formula P(p1,p29q1,q2). Then use each period as the
base to construct a series of T aggregate price levels using the bilateral

function P. Normalize the resulting series so that the first price is

33

unity.47 The resulting T series or normalized price levels may be written
as follows:

Fisher then suggested that the price level for period t, P say, should be
an arithmetic average of the period t price level in each of the T series

The corresponding quantity levels Qt can be defined numerically using the

multilateral product test relations (42). This method was used by the
Economic Commission for Latin America in the early 1960's. It is described
in Ruggles (1967,185) and is referred to as the market basket method. Note
that (43) is a T period generalization of the two period Edgeworth-

Marshall bilateral formula, P, defined by (32) above.
Fisher was not the first to suggest the market basket method: Walsh
(1901,431) suggested the same method but called it ScroDe's method ith
arithmetic weights. Walsh (1901,399) also suggested the following system

of multilateral price levels pt which he called Scroe's method
zeometric wei2hts:

Pt —l (1I. qk)l/T pt

(44)

t—l

T.

The corresponding Qt can be defined by (42) as usual. It is obvious that
(44) is the multilateral generalization of Walsh's bilateral index
defined by (5) above.

The above multilateral methods construct price and quantity levels for

each period. It is also possible to devise multilateral methods where the
multilateral price index

gives the level of prices in period t relative

to the level of prices in period s and is a function of all of the price

and quantity information for the T periods; i.e., P —

5t

(p

multiperiod generalization of the Fisher ideal index (4):

Gini (1931,10) also defined the multilateral price indexes ((45) and calle

the method the successive weights system. Both Walsh and Cmi noted that
(45) collapsed to

defined by (4) if T—2 and s—i and t—2.

Finally, Cmi (1931,12) did propose a new multilateral method which h
called the circular weight system, because the resulting system of price
indexes pSt satisfied a multilateral analogue to the circular test (9)48•

Given any bilateral price index function P(p11p2,q1,q2), define Cmi's
multilateral level of prices in period t relative to the period s level as
follows:

can be defined by (46). This

method was later proposed (using F as the P) by E1tet and K6ves (1964) an
Szulc (1954) in the multiregional context and is known as the EKS system.

Cmi (1931,13-24) tested out his circular weight system (as well as
some other alternatives) using the Fisher ideal 2F defined by (4) as his
bilateral ?,

for

8 time period observations on 5 Italian cities. Thus

Cmi's computations were both multiperiod (between time periods) and
multilateral (between locations).
The ratio type price indexes, (45) proposed by Walsh and (47) propose'

by Cmi, can be converted into price levels pt(pl

If we take the Cini-EKS price levels defined by (49) and divide each
of them through by P1, it can be seen that the resulting normalized price

levels t1l are closely related to Fisher's (normalized) blended price
levels defined by (41): for the Fisher price levels, we take the arithmetic

Walsh (190l,399)(l924,509) noted the primary disadvantage of using the

q ):

if the number of periods increases, all of the indexes have to be

recomputed.49 This is not necessarily a fatal objection since it is normal
practice for statistical agencies to periodically issue historical
revisions and there is no reason why the revisions could not be
accomplished using multiperiod indexes.

However, at present, it does not seem prudent to enthusiastically
endorse a multiperiod system of index numbers since not enough research has
been done on the axiomatic properties of the various multilateral or

multiperiod alternatives)0 Moreover, it would be desirable to develop
multiperiod exact and superlative index number formulae and then examine

the axiomatic properties of the resulting indexes. In the bilateral case,
the Fisher ideal price index F emerges as the natural choice of a
functional form since it seems to satisfy more reasonable tests than any

37

other knoc.xn formula and it is superlative as well. We need a multilateral

counterpart to this "ideal" bilateral functional form.

To sum up: a comparison of the fixed base, chain, all binary
comparisons and multiperiod systems leads to no clear choice at this stage
However, if a definite choice has to be made, I would vote for the chain
system used with the bilateral Fisher ideal index

9.

Is the Substitution Bias Small?

The substitution bias in the consumer price index is the discrepancy

between the Laspeyres or Paasche price indexes, L and P defined by (2)
and (3) above, and the consumer's true cost of living index, defined by th

right hand side of (23). There is an analogous substitution bias in the
output price index.

The following quotation indicates Triplett's judgment on the size of
the substitution bias:

"Though it has long been a staple of economists' educations, the
substitution bias in a fixed-weight price index for consumption
is just not very large." (Triplett, 1988,26).

To support the above opinion, Triplett cites the relatively close agreemen
between the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes for U.S. aggregate
consumption data. Triplett's judgeinent would be correct if in fact these
indexes were true microeconomic Paasche and Laspeyres indexes, but they ar
not: microeconomic samples of price ratios pt+l/pt for various goods i are
combined with base period expenditure shares that are obtained from

periodic consumer expenditure surveys. The resulting aggregate indexes at

not quite L and

defined by (2) and (3) above.

38

It may well be that Triplett is correct in his judgement, but the
evidence to support his position has not yet been presented.

Due to the computer revolution, it is now possible to undertake some
experiments which could help to determine the extent of the substitution

bias. Retail outlets that have computerized price and quantity information
on their sales could be sampled. Detailed microeconomic price and quantity
vectors Pt and qt could be constructed and the Laspeyres, Paasche and
Fisher indexes defined by (2)-(4) above could be calculated and compared
with corresponding official consumer or producer price indexes that covered

the same range of goods. Such firm

oriented

experiments could provide

use_ui information on the size of the substitution bias.51

10.

Is the Niew Good Bias Small?

Triplett (1988) has a nice discussion of recent methods for adjusting

for quality change that have been used by d Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In keeping with the historical nature of this extended comment on Triplett,
we shall first briefly review the ancient literature on methods for quality
adjustment.

Some of the early researchers on price measurement were aware of the
problem of quality change but the pace and direction of the change did not
seem large enough to warrant an explicit treatment.52

However, by the latter part of the nineteenth century, Sidgwick
(1883,68) realized that not only were improvements in the quality of goods
-

leading

to a bias in price comparisons, but also the growth of

international and interregional trade (due primarily to transportation
improvements) led to the systematic introduction of "entirely new kinds of
things" and this too led to a bias in price comparisons. As the following

39

quotation indicates, Sidgwick (1883,68) thought that utility theory would
play a role in eliminating these biases:
"Here again there seems to be no means of attaining more than a

rough and approximate solution of the problem proposed; and to reach
even this we have to abandon the prima facie exact method of comparing
prices, and to substitute the essentially looser procedure of
comparing amounts of utility or satisfaction.

Unfortunately, the mathematical apparatus of consumer theory was not
sufficiently developed at that time to enable Sidgwick to make any specific
progress on the new good problem.

In a brilliant paper, Marshall (1887,373) not only proposed the

tabular standard, the chain system and the Edgeworth-Marshall index number
formula (32), he also made the first real progress on the appropriate
treatment of new goods, as the following quotation indicates:
"This brings us to consider the great problem of how to modify

our unit so as to allow for the invention of new commodities. The
difficulty is insuperable,

we compare two distant periods without

access to the detailed statistics of intermediate times, but it can be

got over fairly well by systematic statistics. A new commodity almost
always appears at first at something like a scarcity price, and its
gradual fall in price can be made to enter year by year into
readjustments of the unit of purchasing power, and to represent fairly
well the increased power of satisfying our wants which we derive from
the new commodity." (Marshall, 1887,373).

As the above quotation indicates, Marshall was well aware of the
product cycle and he felt that the early introduction of new commodities

40

into the consumer price index in the context of the chain system would
capture

of

the benefits due to the introduction of new commodities.

As we shall see later, not quite jj of the benefits are captured using
Marshall's suggested method, since his method incorrectly ignores the new
good in the first period that it makes its appearance.

Marshall (i .373,374) also realized that improvements in
transportation led to the general availability of location specific goods,

such as fish at the seaside or strawberries at a farm. Marshall correctly
felt that these "old" goods that suddenly became available at many

locations should be regarded as "new' goods and treated in the same way as

a genuinely new good. His words on this important observation are worth
quoting:

"This class of consideration is of much more importance than at

first sight appears; for a great part of modern agriculture and
transport industries are devoted to increasing the periods of time

during which different kinds of food are available. Neglect of this
has, in my opinion, viated the statistics of the purchasing power of
many in medieval times with regard to nearly all kinds of foods except
corn; even the well-to-do would hardly get so simple a thing as fresh
meat in winter." (Marshall, 1887,374).

Marshall's suggested treatment of the new good problem was
acknowledged and adopted by many authors including Irving Fisher (1911,204)

and Pigou (1912,47). As we saw earlier in section 8, Divisia (1926,45)
working from his independent perspective also suggested the use of the
chain method as a means of dealing with the new good problem.

41

The next important contributor to the discussion of new goods in price

measurement was Keynes. Keynes (1930,94) desctibed in some detail one of
the most common methods for dealing with the new good problem: simply
ignore any new or disappearing goods in the two time periods under

consideration and calculate the price index on the basis of the goods that

are common to the two situations. The corresponding quantity index was to
be obtained residually by deflating the relevant value ratio by this

narrowly based price index. Keynes called this method the hizhest common
factor method. This method would be identical to Marshall's chain method
if the two time periods were chosen to be adjacent ones. However Keynes
(1930,105-106) advocated his method in the context of a fixed base system

of index numbers and he specifically rejected the chain method for 3
reasons: (i) each time a new product is introduced, a chain index does not
take into account the benefits of the expanded choice set, and thus over
long periods of time, the chain price index will be biased upwards and the
corresponding quantity index will be biased downwards; (ii) the chain index
fails Walsh's multiperiod identity test, (13) above, and (iii) the chain
method was statistically laborious.

Keynes' last objection to the chain method is no longer relevant in

this age of computers. Moreover, Keynes was unable to offer any positive
alternative to the chain method for comparing situations separated by long
periods of time as the following quotation indicates:

"We cannot hope to find a ratio of equivalent substitution for
gladiators against cinemas, or for the conveniences of being able to
buy motor cars against the conveniences of being able to buy slaves."
(Keynes, 1930,96).

42

However Keynes' first objection to the chain method (which was later

echoed by Pigou (l932,72)) was certainly valid (as was his second
objection). A satisfactory theoretical solution to Keynes' first objection
did not occur until Hicks adapted the analytical apparatus of consumer
theory to the problem.

When new consumer goods make their appearance for the first time, say
in period 2, their prices and quantities can be observed.

In period 1, the

quantities of the new goods are all obviously zero but what are the

corresponding prices? Hicks (1940,114) provided a theoretical solution:
"They are those prices which, in the 1 situation, would just make

the demands for these commodities (from the whole community) equal to

zero. These prices cannot be estimated, but we can observe that
between the two situations the demands for these commodities will have
increased from zero to certain positive quantities; and hence it is
reasonable to suppose that the 'prices' of these commodities will

usually have fallen relatively to other prices. This principle is
sufficient to give us a fairly good way of dealing with the case of
new goods.'

Of course, in the context of the producer price index, the appropriate
period I shadow prices for the new goods are those prices which just induce
each period 2 producer of the new goods to produce zero quantities in
period 1.

Hicks' basic idea was used extensively by Hofsten (1952,95-97) who
dealt not only with new goods, but also adapted the Hicksjan methodology to

deal with disappearing goods as well. Hofsten (1952,47-50) also presents a
nice discussion of various methods that have been used to adjust for

43

quality change, similar to Triplett's (1988) discussion of quality change
measurement techniques.

Frank Fisher and Karl Shell (1972,22-26) laid out the formal algebra
for constructing the period 1 Hicksian "demand reservation prices" defined

in the above quotation by Hicks. Diewert (1980,498—501) used the Hicksian
framework to look at the bias in the Fisher price index F defined by (4)
when the reservation prices were incorrectly set equal to zero and compared
this index to the Fisher price index that simply ignored the existence of
the new goods in the two periods under consideration (which is Marshall's

method).54 Diewert (1980,501-503) also made some suggestions for
estimating the appropriate Hicksian reservation prices in an econometric
framework.

Is the new good bias large or small? One can only answer this
question in the context of the price measurement procedures used by

individual statistical agencies. In Diewert (1987,779), some simple
hypothetical examples were given which showed that traditional fixed base

procedures could generate much higher measures of price increase than would

be generated using the chain method,55 However, what is needed is
empirical evidence.

Numerical computation of alternative methods based on detailed firm
data on individual prices and quantities where new goods are carefully

distinguished would cast light on the size of the new good bias. Thus the
firm oriented experiments suggested at the end of the previous section to
cast light on the size of the substitution bias could also be used to study
the size of the new good bias.

44
Another line of empirical work which would be of interest would be to
collect industry price and quantity data on various major new goods (e.g.,
microwave ovens, video recorders, home computers, satellite dishes, etc.)

and then attempt to rework the relevant price indexes in the light of this
extra data.

11. Has the Theory of the Cost of LIvin Index been Exhausted?
Triplett (198825) appears to answer the above question in the
affirmative as the following quotation indicates:
"The CCL index has been subjected to far more research, both
theoretical and empirical, than any other price index topic in the

history of index numbers. It seems to me that much of the fruit has
been picked from this tree."
It seems to me that the harvest is not yet over.

A large gap in our current statistical system is in the area of the

consumer's allocation of time. Many years ago, Reeker (1965) showed how
the consumer's time constraint could be integrated into traditional
consumer theory and he applied his new framework to cast light on a wide

variety of applied economic problems. Additional applications can be found
in a recent book edited by Juster and Stafford (1985). In order to
implement Becker's theory, information on the consumer's allocation of time
is required, broken up into: (i) time at work561 (ii) time commuting to
work, .

(iii)

time spent shopping, (iv) time spent at housework, and (v) time

spent at various leisure activities. Since many productivity improvements
involve efficiencies in the consumer's use of time (e.g., a new subway.

line, an automated banking machine, electronic scanning of prices at the

45

supermarket, etc.), it seems appropriate for Statistical Agencies to
consider the implementation of a version of Becker's framework.

Another area of household statistics which requires further
theoretical development and empirical implementation is the area of income
statistics: labour income should be decomposed into price and quantity
components, income taxes should be taken into account in an appropriate

manner and capital gains should be recognized as components of income. The
point here is that most of the household measurement theory has
concentrated on the commodity demand side and there has not been enough
emphasis on the household factor supply and income sides.

57

12. Conclusion
Jack Triplett has presented the profession with an excellent survey of

the price measurement literature since 1961. In sections 2 to 6 above, we
augmented his survey by providing an overview of the pre 1961 literature on

price measurement and index number theory in general. In sections 7 to 11,
we discussed various topics where we did not seem to be in close agreement
with some of the views expressed by Triplett in his paper.

In some cases,

we also provided a historical survey of these controversial topics: in
section 8, we reviewed the early literature on the chain principle and
various alternatives to it, and in section 10, we reviewed the early
literature on the new good problem.

It seems appropriate to conclude by listing three recommendations for
Statistical Agencies where we agree with Triplett and then we shall list an
additional four recommendations where we may be in some disagreement.

(1). Statistical Agencies should be encouraged to provide users with
adequate printed documentation.

46

(2). The decomposition of labor income (on the household side) and
labor payments (on the finn sideY into price and quantity components needs
improvement: weighted index numbers should be used for quantities rather
than unweighted manhours and manhours should be disaggregated into various
occupational, educational and demographically homogeneous categories.

(3). In the context of the cost of living index, the flow of services
concept should be extended to other classes of consumer durables in
addition to housing.

(4). My preferred method for decomposing a value ratio into price and
quantity components is the use of a superlative index number formula in the
context of the chain method.

(5). Since it is usually impossible to collect complete price and
quantity information for each value cell in the relevant accounting
framework, it will be necessary to resort to some sort of sampling

principle. The appropriate objects to sample are values within the
relevant cell in the first period. These sampled values would then be
broken up into detailed prices and quantities which would then be observed

in the following period as well. Finally, Fisher ideal price indexes
should be constructed using these sampled values for the two periods and
the corresponding quantity indexes should be constructed by deflating the

relevant population value ratios by these (sample) price indexes. The
entire procedure is explained in some detail by Pigou (1932,75-77).

(6). The sizes of the substitution bias and the new good bias are

still in doubt. The empirical experiments described in sections 9 and 10
above would be useful in determining the size of these biases.

47

(7). More empirical and theoretical work needs to be done on the
household supply side; see the suggestions on incorporating Becker's theory
of the allocation of time and on the construction of household real income
indexes made in section 11 above.

another pioneer in the field, see Criliches (1988)

The following quotation from Triplett is particularly insightful:

"The episode of CPI housing underscores the fact that soundness of a
government statistical series requires not just good staff analysis,
but as well the formation of a consensus among users - a conceptually

correct measurement from the standpoint of economic or statistical
theory that is not accepted by, or is not understood by, broad user
groups does not meet all the requirements for a public economic
measurement." (Triplett, 1988, footnote 15).
3.

See Griliches (1970), Triplett (1983b) and Jorgenson (1988) for a

lengthier discussion of the issues.

It is interesting to note that Bowley

(1901,228) (1928,236-237) anticipated many of the modern objections to the
use of unweighted average wages as the price of labor and unweighted
mathours as the quantity of labor as the following quotation from Bowley
(1901,228) illustrates: "The application of index-numbers to wage

statistics does not involve any fresh principles. It is not permissible to
ignore weights in this case; for an unweighted average would not allow for
the general tendency to increase numbers where wages are rising."

4. A good account of Fleetwood's contributions with extensive quotations
can be found in Ferger (1946).

5. See Fisher (1913,437)
6. Scrope does not refer Lowe (or anybody else for that matter) since as a
Member of Parliament, he seemed to be writing an extended political speech.
However, it seems likely that he knew of Lowe's work since his proposals

49

and terminology were so similar to those of Lowe. Scrope (1833,320) also
proposed a comprehensive system of social security fo workers "when
rendered incapable of labour by illness, age or accident." Another early
proposer of the tabular standard who does not refer to Fleetwood or Lowe is
the American economist Willard Phillips who made his proposal in 1828; see
Jastram (1951) for a description of the contributions of Phillips.

7. Edgeworth (1925,331) called the method the consumption standard rather
than the tabular standard.

8. Bowley was not exclusively an advocate of the statistical approach as
we shall see later. Also, initially Edgeworth took a broader view of the
index number theory (recall his endorsement of the tabular standard if
quantities remained constant), but after this initial broadness, he became
a very strident defender of the statistical approach; in particular,
Edgeworth's (1923) criticisms of Walsh's test approach became quite heated.

9. Keynes (1930,72) also used some rather colorful language to criticize
the statistical approach as the following quotation indicates:

"I have

long believed that this is a will-o'-the-wisp, a circle-squaring expedition
which has given an elusive taint, difficult to touch or catch, to the

theory of price index numbers traditional in England. This is not equally

true of America. Nevertheless whilst the Americans have not worshipped
the mythical creature, they have not (with the exception, perhaps, of Mr.

Walsh) actively combatted him or dragged him out of the twilit cave where
Edgeworth judiciously kept him."

10. Edgeworth mistakenly attributed this test to Westergaard (1890), but
Westergaard's circular test is slightly different as we shall see.

50

11. A weaker identity test would require both prices and quantities to
remain constant. No one could object to this weaker identity test, but it
is certainly possible to object to the strong identity test.

12. See Fisher (1922,413).
13. Alternative names for this test might be the constant basket i.t or
the tabular standard test. Walsh (1901,540)(l921,543) does not provide a
name for this test.

14. Walsh (1901.385) noted that the strong proportionality test implies
the strong identity test; i.e., (12) implies (8).

15. Walsh (1924,506) finally called this test the circular test but it
seems best not to confuse Walsh's test (13) with Westergaard's test (9).
If P satisfies the time reversal test (10), then (9) implies (13)

However, if P satisfies (13), then P satisfies the weak identity test
P(p,p,q,q) = 1 as well as (10) and (9). Upon noting that the index number

formula P(p1,p2q1,q2) a 0 satisfies (9) but not (10), we see that (9) and
(13) are not equivalent tests; i.e., Walsh's test (13) is more restrictive
than Westergaard's test (9).

16. This test postulates that the functional form that works for the price
index P(p1,p2,q1,q2) should also do the job as a quantity index, provided

that the role of prices and quantities is interchanged. This transforms
(14) into Fisher's strong factor reversal

1212 1212 2211

P(p ,p ,q ,q )P(q ,q ,p ,p ) — p •q /p 'q

17. Frjsch (1930,404-405) tried to show that a bilateral index number
formula P could not simultaneously satisfy the base, commensurability,

determinateness and factor reversal tests while Wald (1937,180,182) and
Samuelson (1974,18-20) showed that P could not simultaneously satisfy the

51

proportionality, circular, and factor reversal tests. Many other
impossibility theorems were obtained by Eichhorn (1976) and Eichhorn and
Voeller (1976).

18. In particular, see Eichhorn and Voeller (1976).
19. Ville assumed the maximization of a linearly homogeneous utility
function subject to a budget constraint while Hulten assumed cost
minimization subject to a linearly homogeneous production function

constraint. Results equivalent to the Ville-Hulten results were also
obtained by Samuelson and Swamy (1974,578-574).

20. Hofsten (1952) appears to be the first researcher who noticed this
difficulty with the Divisia price index.

21. See also Samuelson and Swamy (1974,579) for alternative suggestions on
how to approximate the continuous time Divisia indexes with discrete data.

22. The right hand side of (21) can be regarded as an approximation to the
arithmetic average of the compensating and equivalent variations defined by

Hicks (1942). Thus the measurement of differences in aggregate quantities
led to consumer led to consumer surplus theory while the measurement of
ratios led to the economic theory of index numbers.

23. For surveys, see Frisch (1936), Samuelson (1947,146-163), Ruggles
(1967), Pollak (1971), Samuelson and Swamy (174), Afriat (1977), Deaton and
Muellbauer (1980,167-184) and Diewert (1980)(l981)(Lt..ia)(1983b)(1987).

24. See for example, Diewert (1983a,l71).
25. The English translation of the original Russian article by Kon'is

(1924) did not become available until 1939. Thus Frisch (1936,25) did not
have access to the original KonUs article and he mistakenly attributed the
KonUs limits or bounds on the true cost of living to Haberler (1927).

52

26. Diewert (1976,115) introduced this term to cover both the production
and utility function context.

27. The first mention of the word "exact" in this index number context
appears to be by Samuelson (1947,155). Afriat (1972,45) also uses the term
exact.

28. See Balk (1981,1556) for a clear proof of Frisch's result.

29. With these restrictions, f(q) — q•Aq —

[q.Aq]"2.

h(g(q)]

where h(x) — x2 and

Thus in this case, f is a monotonically increasing

function of the linearly homogeneous function g(q) over the set of q such

that q'Aq

0.

30. For a nice exposition and evaluation of the Frisch and Wald quadratic
approximation results as well as of some proposals by Samuelson (1974,16),
see Balk (1981)

31. The KonUs and Byushgens (1926) paper was published in Russian and non
Russian speaking economists seemed to be unaware of the paper until it was
cited (incorrectly) by Schultz (1939,8).

32. See Pollak (1971,105).
33. The Cobb-Douglas functional form was perhaps first used in the
economics literature by Wicksell (1958,98) in the nineteenth century.

34. The translog unit cost function was introduced by Christensen,
Jorgenson and Lau (1971).

35. Vartia (1978) provided an alternative derivation of this result.
36. Malmquist (1953) was the first to use the distance function in index
number theory.

53

37. Bennet (1920,462) recognized that not all of the parameters of a
quadratic utility function could be identified (due to the unobservable
nature of utility) since he wrote of determining the parameters only up to
a ratio.

38. These perhaps overly pessimistic calculations lead to the following
impossibility theorem: economists will never know the truth, even to the
second order.

39. For a definitive treatment of separability concepts and duality
theory, see Blackorby, Primont and Russell (1978).

40. See the theoretical discussion in Diewert (1980,475-476) and the
empirical results in Harper, flerndt and Wood (1985) on alternative rental
price formulae.

41. Walsh (1901, 207) attributed the chain principle to Julius Lehr (1885)
45—46), who was motivated to introduce the principle in order to deal with
new goods.

42. Divisia (1926,44-47) saw his method as being a variant of the chain
method, with the basic discrete period being one year (which would minimize

seasonal fluctuations). Divisia (1926,45) also thought that the chain
method was the only logical way to make price comparisons over long periods
due to the introduction of new goods and the discovery of new inventions.

As new goods in his time, he mentioned machine guns (to replace the bow and
arrow), submarines, aircraft, the potato and steam engine.

43. However, later Fisher (1922,308-309) preferred the fixed base system.
Pigou (1932,71) criticized Fisher's later position and endorsed the chain
principle for the usual reason: with the introduction of new commodities.
the chain principle is the only way to make comparisons between distant

54

periods.

44. Walsh (1901,401) (1924506) made the same criticism of the chain
systeo. SziXLc (1983,540) also uses Walsh's Test in his evaluation of fixed
base versus chain index numbers.

45. Actually1 Hill (1988,7) uses the more general Proportionality Test,

P*(pO,pt,Apt,qO,qt,qt) —

46.

A

for A

> 0,

in place of (39).

Fisher (1922,280-283) also found that

-

satisfied Walsh's Multiperiod

Identity Test (13) to a high degree of approximation.

47. Actually, Fisher (1922,301) used a slightly different normalization.
48.

In fact, all of the multilateral indexes defined in this section

satisfy the multilateral circularity test.

49. Walsh (1901,399) also made the following theoretical objection:
"Besides, how is a past variation between two years several years ago to be
affected by present variations?"

50. For a start on this topic, see Diewert (1987)(1988).
51. Such firm based experiments would yield information on the
substitution bias in output price indexes. Perhaps some day in the future
when consumers use credit or banking cards to pay for all of their
purchases, we could obtain an accurate paper trail that could be used to
construct true microeconomic Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher price indexes.

52. Thus Lowe (1823, Appendix 87) states: "In regard to the quality of our
manufactures, we must speak with more hesitation, and can hardly decide
whether the balance be in favour of the present or of a former age; for if
our fabrics are now much more neat and convenient, they are in a
considerable degree less durable."

55

53. Pigou, (1932,71) also has a nice criticism of Keynes' highest common
factor method which was later repeated by Hofsten (1952,59). Pigou also
criticized Fisher's (1922,308-312) later preference for the fixed base
method.

54. The second index has a smaller bias than the first index.
55. Since 1978, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has used a probability
sampling approach in the consumer price index which probably reduces some
of this fixed weight bias, but the bias is not eliminated.

56. Riddell (1983) discusses the issues involved in incorporating leisure
time (defined to be time spent not at work) in measures of the standard of
living and he calculates some of his new measures of economic welfare using
Canadian data.

57. See Diewert and Bossens (1987) for an introduction to these topics.
