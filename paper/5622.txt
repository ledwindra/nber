Weiss (198 1)), one line of inquiry has explored the hypothesis that capital markets constrain

Viewed from this perspective, an interesting empirical phenomenon

One possible source

of this correlation is that successful entrepreneurs may also be more able and willing to transfer
financial wealth to their offspring, thereby relaxing capital market constraints.

In short, family

credit markets may substitute for formal access to funds. However, an alternative explanation is
that self-employment

is correlated across generations because parents transmit to their offspring

valuable experiences or other managerial human capital. After all, the survival process may
serve to identify only the better-qualified

entrepreneurs.

Because policies designed to augment

financial capital do not necessarily increase human capital (and vice versa), it is essential to
distinguish between these potential effects.
Previous research that has focused on liquidity constraints has followed a simple line of
reasoning.

Initial capital is required for a new enterprise.

If individuals are price takers in the

credit market, then the ability to obtain capital and start the enterprise will be independent of the
entrepreneur’s

personal finances.

However, in cross-sectional

work, Meyer (1990) found that

this prediction was rejected; the probability of being self-employed

increased with an

individual-s net worth, ceteris paribus.

Likewise, Blanc hflower and Oswald’s (1990) study of

British young men indicated that a receipt of a ~5,000 inheritance doubled the probability of
setting up a business.
Unfortunately,

a positive sign on assets could both suggest either that

or that entrepreneurs accumulate more wealth. Thus, Meyer

(1990) and others have argued that longitudinal data are preferable because explanatory variables
may be dated prior to the time of the decision, reducing the chances that the explanatory
variables are consequences,

not causes, of being self-employed.

Using panel data, Evans and

Leighton (1989) and Evans and Jovanovic (1989) analyzed transitions to self-employment.

In

each case, the coefficient on assets was positive and statistically significant, pointing to the
presence of liquidity constraints.

Meyer (1990) also examined transitions from wage-earning to

and found that from a statistical point of view, assets were significant, but their

impact was quite minor. Finally, in a pair of studies Holtz-Eakin,

Joulfaian and

Rosen (1994a, 1994b) found that receipt of an inheritance increased the probability of becoming
self-employed,

raised the capital invested in a new enterprise, enhanced the survival probability

of extant sole-proprietors,

and increased the gross receipts of existing entrepreneurs.

Thus, a

general pattern has emerged in which a windfall of capital relaxes capital market constraints and
eases the transition to entrepreneurship,

but the quantitative impact remains somewhat unsettled.

A second related line of research focuses directly on the intergenerational

transmission

of

labor market status. Recent studies (Altonji and Dunn (1 991 ), Solon (1 992) and Zimmerman
(1992)) have estimated a larger intergenerational

They show also,

father is a union member.

Looking directly at the question of interest in this study, Lentz and

Laband ( 1990) show that the probability that a young man is self-employed

is significantly

higher when his father is self-employed.
To summarize, the previous literature suggests a role for both financial and human capital
in explaining the intergenerational

correlation in self-employment.

Our goal is to determine in a

more direct way the separate effects of family financial resources and family human capital on
the likelihood of a young adult becoming self-employed.

the human capital acquired by the individual from parents and other sources; we return to this

Ai is the amount of capital financed by borrowing.

Previous research suggests limits to such

borrowing; we summarize any capital market constraints that limit borrowing according to the
individual’s

net assets via a liquidity constraint:

ki s l~(Ai).

If the individual becomes an entrepreneur, his optimal amount of capital maximizes
expected entrepreneurial

income subject to the liquidity constraint.

One would expect parental linkages to affect the decision-making

Specifically, we work with the samples of young men who were aged 14 to 24 in 1966,

mature women who were aged 30 to 44 in 1967, and the sample of older men who were aged 45
to 59 in 1966. The young men were surveyed 12 times between 1966 and 1981, while the older
men were surveyed 11 times over the same period. The mature women were also surveyed 11
times through 1982, the last year of their data we use. We restrict our analysis to the subset of
young men who can be matched to a parent in either of the older cohorts.3 We further restrict our
attention to observations

did not return to school in a subsequent year. We keep observations

Access to Wealth

Previous research has highlighted the role of access to capital in augmenting transitions to
self-employment.

One might conjecture that those parents who survive as entrepreneurs may

have greater access to financial capital and are able to influence their children’s employment

NLS respondents answer a wide variety of labor

the South or in an SMSA, and spouse’s income,

and

in a cross-section by including variables that are dated at a time prior to the

entry into self-employment.

We begin with a specification that focuses on the young men’s own

-12-

financial assets and human capital (age and education), and then successively augment the
equation with variables capturing the potential contributions

of their parents’ financial and

human capital.

In our sample, the amual transition rate from a wage and salary job to self-employment
is 3.1 percent. 15 We begin our analysis of this process using the baseline estimate shown in
column (1) of Table 6. In addition to the variables shown, this (and all other) specification
includes the following control variables: year dummy variables, four indicators of educational
attainment,

age, age squared, number of siblings, number of dependents, spouse’s earnings, and

indicators for black, married, residence in an SMSA and residence in the south. The Appendix
shows the entire baseline specification.
We begin in column (1) by replicating previous work showing the link between
individuals’ assets and transitions to self-employment.

In our sample, the effect of the young

man’s own assets (measured in thousands of dollars) on the transition into self-employment

is

estimated to be 0.0078, with a p-value of 0.002, ‘b This coefficient implies that a $10,000
increase in own assets raises the probability of entering self-employment

by 0,0015, a finding

consistent with the literature indicating the limited importance of capital market constraints on
the entry into entrepreneurship.

assets (column 3) gives a slightly stronger and more significant estimate.

-13-

The larger coefficient on total assets confims

our expectation that parent’s business assets might

be more strongly related to their son’s self-employment

plans. Still, even if one accepts this

estimate the overall impact is not great, To get a sense of magnitudes, a $10,000 increase in
parents’ total assets raises the probability of a son’s transition into self-employment

by 0.0009,

which is small relative to both the sample transition probability of 0.031 and the sons’ own-asset
impact.
One possibility

is that the evolution of parents’ assets maybe influenced by sons’

transitions to self-employment;

i.e., it may be the case that parents’ assets may be endogenous.

To control for the possibility,

in column (4) we measure parents’ assets in 1966, rather than in

the contemporaneous

year. We choose 1966 because it is the beginning of the sumey period.

The sons are quite young or still in school, thus lessening the possibility that parental asset
accumulation

is driven by the children’s business plans. Although the logit coefficient is larger,

the marginal effect of parents’ assets remains small.
We turn next to investigating

the role of human capital. These results are presented in the

remaining columns of Table 6. In column (5) we consolidate the self-employment

experiences

of the parents into a single variable, PARENTS, our indicator for whether either parent was ever
self-employed

over the survey years. As shown in column (5), the strong correlation evident in

Table 2 survives; the variable has a strong positive effect when entered by itself. Moreover, the

2.

Altonji, Hayashi. and Kotlikoff ( 1992) examine resource sharing within extended
fmilies.
Cox (1990) and Cox and Jappelli (1990) find that intergenerational cash
transfers are targeted toward liquidity constrained individuals. Englehardt and Mayer
(1995) find that cash transfers from parents allow home buyers to afford larger down
payments, purchase earlier and buy a larger home.

3.

There are two possible ways to match fathers’ information to sons’ records. First, the
father may appear in the older men’s sample. Alternatively, the sons’ mothers maybe in
the mature women sample. If so, we rely on the mothers’ report of her husband’s
information. Similar rules apply to matching mothers and sons.

4.

It is not obvious how eliminating observations for individuals based on retirement affects
the measured prevalence of self-employment. Fuchs (1982) shows that the self-employed
retire later than the non-self-employed and that many people become self-employed after
retiring from a wage and salary j ob. The first effect would tend to raise measured selfemployment, while our age and retirement restrictions will exclude the switchers and
lower our measure of self-employment.

5,

Survey participants were not asked about dual jobs in every survey year. Hence, we are
unable to gauge the importance of self-employment as a secondary j ob or of part-time
self-employment.

We employ the NLS-provided

8.

A natural question arises as to whether the NLS reports of self-employment are indicative
of self-employment in the population as a whole. To shed some light on this issue, we
present (below) the self-employment rates for similarly defined age groups calculated
from the March Current Population Survey (CPS) in the corresponding years. While the
cross-sectional nature of the CPS precludes checking for transitions related to schooling
and retirement in the same fashion as in the NLS, the rates are sufficiently close to
suggest that the incidence of self-employment in the NLS is quite close to that in the
population as a whole.

Lentz andLaband(1990)
found that 26.5 percent of second-generation
inherited or bought a family business.

12.

In Lentz and Laband’s (1990) sample of self-employed men, second-generation
proprietors on average entered self-employment 1.9 years earlier than first-generation
proprietors.

13.

In each case, a chi-square test rejects (at the 0.01 level of significance) the null hypothesis
that the prevalence rates are equal for families where parents were and were not selfemployed. We exclude families with four or more brothers due to small samples.

14.

In five of the survey years, detailed questions were asked about the value of household
assets and liabilities including the value of savings accounts, stocks, bonds and mutual
finds, residence and real estate market value and liability, and farm and business market
value and liability. In addition to the reported total net value of assets, we construct
another measure that excludes farm and business assets and liabilities. In each case we
exclude a handfil of extreme observations at each end of the asset distribution. In order
to more filly exploit the panel aspect of the data, we interpolate an asset value for every
survey year between each two consecutive asset reports. All dollar values have been
converted to 1982-84 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. We do this for parents’
assets and for sons’ assets. See Dunn and Holtz-Eakin (1995) for additional details
regarding the measurement of net assets.

15.

This is very close to Fairlie’s (1994) estimate of the transition probability of 3.3 percent
for men in the PSID.

16.

The p-values are based on standard errors that are corrected using Huber’s formula to
account for the fact that there are multiple observations per person in the dataset.

17.

Fairlie (1994) uses a net-of-business asset measure similar to ours and finds that a
$10,000 increase at the mean raises the probability of a transition by 0.005. Using asset
variation generated by the receipt of an inheritance, Holtz-Eakin, Joulfaian, and Rosen
(1994b) find a substantial effect: a $100,000 inheritance raises the annual transition
probability by 0.00825. In contrast, Meyer (1990) finds that an additional $100,000 of
net worth raises the transition probability by only 0.00017.

18.

Fairlie (1994) finds similar strong effects—father’s
transition probability at the mean by 53 percent.

19.

We ran a parallel analysis for the young women’s cohort of the NLS and found that the
MOTHER effect is strongest for daughters, 2.122 @-value= 0.0001), but the FATHER
and BOTH are also strong and significant, 1.238 (0.001) and 1.775 (0.001 ), respectively.
These results are largely consistent with those of Altonji and Dunn (1 994) who find
