    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explains why one in seven Americans has no health insurance, and compares the casualty and the social insurance models of health insurance. The paper discusses the relationship among national health insurance (NHI) , the cost of care, and the health of the population, and it considers the prospects for NHI in the United States in the short and the long run. Four explanations for the absence of NHI in the United States distrust of government, heterogeneity of the population, a robust voluntary sector, and lack of noblesse oblige -- are evaluated in the light of recent political, social, and economic trends.\n\n",
