    "abstract": "\n\nMacroeconomic models often invoke consumption \u201chabits\u201d to explain the substantial persistence of aggregate consumption growth. But a large literature has found no evidence of habits in microeconomic datasets that measure the behavior of individual households. We show that the apparent conflict can be explained by a model in which consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal circumstances but \u2018sticky expectations\u2019 about the macroeconomy. In our model, the persistence of aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers\u2019 imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility costs, because aggregate shocks constitute only a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.\n\n",
