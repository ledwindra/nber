    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper explores global perceptions and understanding of climate change and policies, examining factors that influence support for climate action and the impact of different types of information. We conduct large-scale surveys with 40,000 respondents from 20 countries, providing new international data on attitudes towards climate change and respondents\u2019 socioeconomic backgrounds and lifestyles. We identify three key perceptions affecting policy support: perceived effectiveness of policies in reducing emissions, their impact on low-income households, and their effect on respondents\u2019 households (self-interest). Educational videos clarifying policy mechanisms increase support for climate policies; those merely highlighting climate change\u2019s impacts do not.\n\n",
