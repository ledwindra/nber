The Magnitude and Nature of Risk Selection in Employer-Sponsored Health Plans
Sean Nicholson, M. Kate Bundorf, Rebecca M. Stein, and Daniel Polsky
NBER Working Paper No. 9937
August 2003
JEL No. I11
ABSTRACT
Most existing studies of risk selection in the employer-sponsored health insurance market are case studies
of a single employer or of an employer coalition in a single market. We examine risk selection in the
employer-sponsored market by applying a “switcher” methodology to a national, panel data set of enrollees
in employer-sponsored health plans. We find that people who switched from a non-HMO to an HMO plan
used 11 percent fewer medical services in the period prior to switching than people who remained in the nonHMO plan, and that this relatively low use persists once they enroll in an HMO. Furthermore, people who
switch from an HMO to a non-HMO plan used 18 percent more medical services in the period prior to
switching than those who remained in an HMO plan. HMOs would most likely continue to experience
favorable risk selection if employers adjusted health plan payments based on enrollees’ gender and age
because the selection appears to occur based on enrollee characteristics that are difficult to observe, such as
preferences for medical care and health status.

Introduction
Managed care health plans currently cover about 90 percent of the people who receive employersponsored health insurance. Health insurance companies often have incentives to design their plans to
attract low-risk enrollees and repel high-risk enrollees. It has been argued that a health insurance market
providing both managed care and non-managed care plans may be inefficient because managed care plans
may be more likely to implement such strategies, resulting in too few people in non-managed care plans
(Cutler and Zeckhauser, 1998). In fact, a number of studies have shown that Medicare HMOs attract a
disproportionate share of the healthy elderly population (Eggers, 1980; Eggers and Prihoda, 1982; Brown
et al., 1993; Cox and Hogan, 1997; Call et al., 1999). Unlike the Medicare risk selection studies that are
national in scope, most studies of risk selection in the employer-sponsored health insurance market
examine single employers or employer coalitions, and the available evidence is mixed. Cutler and
Zeckhauser (1998) found substantial favorable risk selection among state government employees in
Massachusetts for the HMO plan relative to the fee-for-service plan. Altman, Cutler, and Zeckhauser
(2003), examining the same data set, find that almost half of the expenditure difference between
indemnity and HMO plans for eight medical conditions is due to a lower incidence rate among HMO
patients (favorable risk selection), with the remaining difference due to lower provider reimbursement. In
contrast, the RAND Health Insurance Experiment did not find that a Seattle HMO experienced a
favorable selection of patients (Manning et al., 1987), and Polsky and Nicholson (2002) conclude that
HMOs in 60 metropolitan areas were not experiencing favorable selection with respect to non-HMOs in
1996 and 1997.
Eighty percent of the non-elderly who had health insurance in 1999 received it from their
employer or from a family member’s employer.1 Risk selection can occur because only one percent of
U.S. employers adjust the premium payment to a health plan based on an employee’s risk, or expected

medical expenditures (Kennan et al., 2001).2 As a result, most health insurance companies receive the
same revenue for enrolling a young healthy worker as an old sick worker, although the expected medical
costs of the two workers could differ substantially. If health insurers design their plans to attract the
relatively profitable, low-risk enrollees, an inefficient allocation of individuals to plans may result. A
plan that attracts low-risk enrollees can charge a lower premium than a plan that is experiencing adverse
selection. As a result, some people who would enroll in a relatively expensive plan (usually a non-HMO)
if premiums were risk-adjusted to reflect their unique expected costs, will enroll instead in a less
expensive plan (usually an HMO) once the premium difference becomes sufficiently large (Cutler and
Zeckhauser, 1998).
Even though few firms formally risk adjust premium payments to health plans, risk selection may
still be limited. An estimated 20 percent of the employer-sponsored market is enrolled in self-insured
plans where health insurance companies usually receive a fixed payment per employee to administer the
plans and do not bear the financial risk of uncertain medical expenditures (McDonnell and Fronstin, 1999;
InsterStudy, 2000). Furthermore, about 50 percent of the people insured in the employer-sponsored
market were offered a plan or a choice of plans from a single insurance carrier (Keenan et al., 2001). In
these two situations health insurers have no incentive to design plans to attract low-risk employees. Some
firms may also be implementing implicit (to the analyst) risk adjustment by setting the employer’s
contribution for plans experiencing adverse selection higher than the employer’s contribution for plans
experiencing favorable risk selection. Such behavior would encourage all employees to enroll in the plan
experiencing adverse selection.
With the exception of Polsky and Nicholson (2002), all of the studies cited above that examine
the non-elderly, employer-sponsored market are case studies of a single employer or employer coalition
in a single market. Since many employers have instituted measures to mitigate incentives for health plans
to target low-risk enrollees, the results from the case studies mentioned above may not be representative

residence, Medicaid eligibility, and whether or not they are institutionalized in a nursing home.

of national conditions. In this paper we examine whether HMO plans experience favorable risk selection
in the employer-sponsored market by applying a “switcher” methodology to the Community Tracking
Study Household Survey (CTSHS), a recently released national, panel data set of enrollees in employersponsored health plans. The switcher methodology compares medical expenditures in the initial year of
people who chose to switch from a non-HMO (a fee-for-service indemnity plan or a preferred provider
organization) to an HMO plan versus the expenditures in the initial year of the people who remained in
the non-HMO plan both years (and likewise for people who initially were enrolled in an HMO). In
addition, we further decompose risk selection into a component based on enrollee characteristics that
health plans and employers clearly observe (e.g., gender and age) and a component based on enrollee
characteristics that are difficult to observe (e.g., preferences for medical care or health status). This
decomposition will help determine whether risk adjusting peoples’ premiums based on observed
characteristics is likely to minimize or eliminate selection.
We find that HMOs are experiencing favorable risk selection and that this risk selection would
probably persist even if employers adjusted premiums based on an enrollee’s gender and age. People
who switched from a non-HMO to an HMO plan used 11 percent fewer medical services in the period
prior to switching than people who remained in non-HMO plans, and this relatively low use persists once
they enroll in an HMO, relative to those already enrolled in an HMO. We also find that people who
switched from an HMO to a non-HMO plan used 18 percent more medical services in the period prior to
switching than people who remained in the HMO plan. This relatively high use rate does persist once
they enroll in the non-HMO, but the differential is not statistically significant. Ten percent of HMO
enrollees switched to a non-HMO between the first and second round of the CTSHS survey, and their
departure is predicted to reduce an HMO’s aggregate medical expenditures by 2.0 percent per year. Over
a number of years, risk selection of this magnitude could allow HMOs to charge lower premiums than
non-HMOs and attract enrollees who would prefer to be in non-HMOs if premiums could be perfectly
risk adjusted. Favorable risk selection by HMOs would most likely persist even if employers adjusted

health plan payments based on enrollees’ gender and age, because the selection appears to occur based on
enrollee characteristics that are difficult to observe, such as preferences for medical care and health status.

Empirical Methodology
We define risk selection as the difference in medical resource use between HMO enrollees and
non-HMO enrollees due to differences in enrollees’ characteristics, and therefore their demand for
medical services, but not due to differences in the design and management of the two plan types. If we
compare resource use for people who have chosen to enroll in an HMO to people who have chosen to
enroll in a non-HMO plan, we cannot determine how much of the difference is due to enrollee
characteristics and how much is due to differences in how the plans are designed and managed. We
examine people for two years and compare first period medical resource use between people who were
initially enrolled in a non-HMO and switch to an HMO in the second period to those who remain in a
non-HMO plan, and likewise for people initially enrolled in an HMO. By comparing resource use when
the two sets of individuals were enrolled in the same type of plan, expenditure differences can be
attributed to differences in demand for medical services due to differences in health and preferences for
medical care, rather than differences in cost sharing or the extent of the plans’ utilization management
efforts. Since we examine risk selection only for people who switch from a non-HMO to an HMO or
from an HMO to a non-HMO, we estimate a marginal risk selection measure that is relevant for the
enrollees switching plan types, rather than an average risk selection measure that would be relevant for all
enrollees.
We derive separate estimates of risk selection for those who are initially enrolled in an HMO (H)
plan and for those who are initially enrolled in a non-HMO plan (NH). We aggregate medical resource
use into a single expenditure measure using unit prices for each type of service (e.g., price per hospital
day, price per physician visit). Consider a sample of people who are observed in two time periods and
were offered a choice of a non-HMO and an HMO plan by their employer in the second time period. We

5

6
categorize people into four mutually exclusive groups according to the plan in which they were enrolled
in the first and second periods: people who were enrolled in a non-HMO plan in both periods are coded as
NH_NH, people who were enrolled in an HMO plan in both periods as H_H, people who switched from a
non-HMO to an HMO plan as NH_H, and people who switched from an HMO plan to a non-HMO plan
as H_NH.
Using ordinary least squares, we regress medical expenditures for person i in the first period,
measured in dollars (Yi1), on the four indicator variables that characterize the type of plan in the first and
second periods, and individual and firm characteristics (Xi) that could potentially be observed by an
employer and used to risk adjust premiums:
(1)

Yi1 = β1NH_NHi + β2NH_Hi + β3H_Hi + β4H_NHi + β5Xi + εi

The difference in first period medical expenditures between those who switch to an HMO in the second
period (NH_H = 1) and those who remain enrolled in a non-HMO plan (NH_NH=1) is (β2 - β1). If this
difference is negative and significantly different from zero, then HMO plans experience favorable risk
selection relative to the non-HMO plans. Among the population who are not already enrolled in an
HMO, HMOs attract people with relatively low medical expenditures. The difference in first period
medical expenditures between those who switch to a non-HMO in the second period (H_NH = 1) and
those who remain enrolled in an HMO plan (H_H=1) is (β4 - β3). If this difference is positive and
significantly different from zero, then non-HMO plans experience adverse risk selection relative to the
HMO plans. Among the population who are not already enrolled in a non-HMO, non-HMOs attract
people with relatively high medical expenditures.
If an employer uses observed characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and possibly health measures) to
estimate an employee’s expected medical expenditures and adjust the premium payments that a health
plan receives, all employees will be equally profitable from a health insurer’s perspective, ex ante. To
explore this, we first estimate equation (1) with controls for the geographic site (usually a metropolitan
area) but without any enrollee characteristics X. We then estimate equation (1) with an indicator variable

6

7
for an employee’s gender and a set of indicators for their age. If (β2 - β1) and (β4 - β3) are significant
without controlling for age and gender but insignificant once these characteristics are included in the
regression, this implies that employers can mitigate risk selection by simply adjusting health plan
payments for age and gender. That is, health plans would not have incentives to design their plans to
attract people who are expected to be relatively low users of medical services, because the premiums
would be adjusted such that the expected profit would not vary across employee types. We also estimate
equation (1) with a more comprehensive set of possible risk adjusters such as self-reported health, income
level, size of firm, marital status, and the presence of children to see if risk selection would persist with a
more sophisticated risk adjustment system. This specification probably includes more information than
an employer would have for purposes of adjusting premiums, but we present it as an extreme case. If risk
selection is based on observable enrollee characteristics only, then health insurance premiums could be
risk adjusted to prevent plans from designing their plans to attract the most profitable employees. If risk
selection is based on unobserved characteristics, on the other hand, then other policies such as a patient
bill of rights law that restrict plan design may be useful.
We restrict the samples in the above two regressions to people who could choose either an HMO
or a non-HMO in the second period because we want to focus on situations where risk selection is most
likely to occur. If a firm offers one type of plan to its workers from one health insurer, then it is relatively
easy for the insurer to predict aggregate medical costs since it will enroll all employees. However, some
people in our sample had a constrained choice of health plan types in the initial period -- they were either
offered an HMO plan only or a non-HMO plan only -- and then had a choice of plan types in the second
period. Among those unconstrained in their ability to choose their type of health plan in the initial
observation period, much of the sorting of risk between managed care and non-managed care may have
already taken place in previous years. To examine this, we create eight rather than four indicator
variables in equation (1) – four variables for people without a choice of plan types in the first period (e.g.,
H_HNC for people who were only offered an HMO in the first period, and chose an HMO in the second
period when they had a choice of plan types), and four variables for people who were offered both an

7

8
HMO and a non-HMO by their employer in the first period (e.g., H_NHC for people who had a choice of
plans in the first period and chose an HMO, and chose a non-HMO in the second period when they had a
choice of plan types). The “NC” superscript refers to no choice and the “C” refers to a choice of plan
types. We would expect more pronounced risk selection among those who move from a constrained
environment (NC in the first period) to an unconstrained environment relative to people who had a choice
of plan types in both periods.
We also examine medical expenditures in the second period to see if people who switch plan
types have higher or lower expenditures relative to the group of enrollees they join. If, for example,
HMOs attract relatively low users of medical care among the people initially enrolled in non-HMO plans
but these enrollees have second period-expenditures that are similar to those initially enrolled in an HMO,
then risk selection may lower the profitability of non-HMOs but it will have little effect on the
profitability of HMOs. This would be the case, for example, if the first period expenditure difference is
due to a negative or positive health shock that is transitory, and does not persist in the second period. We
run regressions similar to equation (1), where the dependent variable is an enrollee’s medical
expenditures in the second period, and the key variables are indicators for people who switched plan types
between the first and second time periods.

Data
We use data from the first (1996-1997) and second (1998-1999) rounds of the Community
Tracking Study Household Survey (CTSHS). Each survey was administered to more than 60,000 people
and was designed to be representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized population in 60 U.S.
communities and the country as a whole (Kemper et al., 1996). We focus our analysis on the 11,672 nonelderly persons who were surveyed in both rounds and received health insurance from their employer or
the employer of a household member in both years of the survey. The regressions further restrict the
sample to the 6,235 people who were offered both an HMO and a non-HMO plan by their employer in the
second time period. The CTSHS attempted to re-survey a random subset of the round-1 respondents by

8

9
calling the respondents’ telephone numbers used in round 1. A person who changes his telephone
number, perhaps because he moved to another metropolitan area or residence within the same
metropolitan area, would not be included in our sample. Of the 34,029 people who were non-elderly and
receiving employer-sponsored health insurance in round 1 of the CTSHS, 11,672 were re-surveyed and
were still receiving employer-sponsored health insurance in round 2.
In the appendix we report coefficient estimates of a logit regression that equals one if the round-1
respondent who was eligible from our perspective was re-surveyed and still eligible in round 2. Many of
the coefficients are statistically significant, which indicates systematic non-response. As expected, people
who we are likely to be relatively transient, and therefore to change telephone numbers during a two-year
time period, were less likely to be re-surveyed: people between the ages of 18 and 55, non-married
individuals, non-whites, and people with relatively low levels of education and income. People who used
medical services relatively intensely in the first round were also less likely to be re-surveyed. Our results
on risk selection apply, therefore, only to a relatively stable sub-population; we cannot extrapolate our
findings to the general employer-sponsored population. However, it is not obvious, to us at least, whether
the systematic non-response biases our risk selection estimates and, if so, whether they are biased toward
or against finding favorable risk selection for HMOs. That is, non-respondents who expect to use a
relatively large amount of medical services may favor either HMOs or non-HMO plans.
The four key variables for this study are the characterization of HMO and non-HMO plans, the
definition of a person who has a choice of plan types, the definition of a person who switches plan types,
and a person’s estimated medical expenditures. CTSHS respondents were asked to define their plan as
being an HMO or not.3 This question should result in preferred provider organizations (PPOs) being
grouped with non-HMO plans, so we are essentially comparing lightly managed non-HMO plans
(indemnity and PPO) versus more strictly managed plans (point-of-service and HMO plans). We estimate
the risk selection among the sub-sample who was offered a choice of plan types in the second round of

9

10
the survey. We define those with a choice of plan type as all members of a household in which the main
health plan policyholder had the opportunity to select either an HMO plan or a non-HMO from his or her
employer. We also consider household members to have choice if one member (usually a spouse) was
offered an HMO plan only and another member a non-HMO plan only. A “switcher” is defined as an
individual who is enrolled in an HMO plan in round 1 and a non-HMO plan in round 2, or in a non-HMO
plan in round 1 and an HMO in round 2.
The CTSHS records medical service use (e.g., number of physician visits, number of hospital
days), but not medical expenditures. Since we want an aggregate measure of medical use, we estimate
medical expenditure by applying resource weights per unit of medical care (i.e., unit prices) for each of
the reported medical services, as was done in Polsky and Nicholson (2002), Manning et al. (1985) and
Goldman et al. (1998). The resource use weights are estimated from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey (MEPS), and for both survey rounds we use the non-HMO prices. Sample means and standard
deviations are presented in Table 1.

Results
In Table 2 we categorize respondents according to whether they had a choice of health plan types
in each round and the plan they actually chose. The rows of Table 2 refer to the first round and the
columns to the second. The first entry of each “cell” reports the mean medical expenditures for those
respondents in the first round, the second entry in brackets adjusts these first-round medical expenditures
for an enrollee’s gender and age, and third entry in brackets indicates the number of respondents in the
cell. For example, a total of 1,897 people were offered a non-HMO only plan by their employer in both
round 1 and round 2. These people had actual medical expenditures in round 1 of $1,878, on average.
Their risk-adjusted medical expenditures were $1,900, which indicates that their gender and age mix is
similar to that of the overall sample. Our regression analysis will be restricted to people who had a choice

of plan types in round 2 – people in the final two columns of Table 2. People who switch plan types
among those offered a choice in round 2 are listed in bold, and the percentage switching among those
offered a choice of plan types in round 2 is reported in the final column.
Almost half of the sample had no choice of plan type in round 1. That is, they were offered either
a non-HMO only (row 1) or an HMO only (row 2) by their employer in round 1. A number of these
people were offered a choice plan types in round 2 (column 3 and column 4 of rows 1 and 2), and a fairly
large percentage of these people who were able to switch plan types between round 1 and round 2 did so.
For example, 183 of the 726 people (25.2 percent) who were offered an HMO only in round 1 and were
offered both types in round 2, switched to a non-HMO. These switchers had medical expenditures in
round 1 that were $1,001 higher than the people who were also in an HMO in round 1 ($2,861 - $1,860),
were also offered a choice in round 2, and chose to remain in an HMO. We measure risk selection with
round-1 medical expenditures because the plan design and management were presumably the same in
round 1 for those who subsequently switched out of and those who remained in an HMO; differences in
medical expenditures should be due to differences in the demand for medical services.
Non-HMOs experience adverse selection among the no-choice group enrolled in an HMO in
round 1. However, this risk selection is based on easily observed enrollee characteristics such as gender
and age. The difference in risk-adjusted expenditures between the “switchers” and the “stayers” in the
second cell of row 2 is only $84: $1,910 - $1,826. A simple risk adjustment system could equate the
expected profit of these enrollees from a health plan’s perspective. However, HMOs experienced adverse
selection among the non-HMO enrollees who had no choice of plan type in round 1 but did have a choice
in round 2 (row 1, column 3 and column 4 of Table 2). The people switching to an HMO in round 2 had
medical expenditures in round 1 that were $392 higher than the people who remained in a non-HMO
($2,020 - $1,628). These descriptive measures of risk selection do not control for the respondent’s market
or control for more difficult to observe enrollee characteristics such as health status and income.

emergency.”

12
People who were offered a choice of plan types in both rounds (column 3 and 4 of row 3 and 4)
are less likely to switch plan types than those who were constrained in round 1, as expected, although
more than one-sixth of the people did switch. HMOs experienced favorable selection among non-HMO
enrollees who had a choice of plan types in round 1 and round 2 (row 3, column 3 and column 4).
Round-1 medical expenditures for these enrollees who switched to an HMO in round 2 were $529 lower
relative to enrollees who remained in a non-HMO plan ($1,511 - $2,040).
We present our risk selection estimates in Table 3 and Table 4. The sample for the regressions
consists of individuals who were interviewed in both rounds of the survey and were offered both an HMO
and a non-HMO in the second round. In the first column of Table 3 we regress an individual’s medical
expenditures in the first round on four indicator variables that describe a person’s plan in round 1 and
round 2 and a set of 60 indicator variables for a person’s market (usually an MSA). We do not include
employee characteristics in the first specification in order to measure risk selection in a situation where
firms engage in no formal or informal risk adjustment of premiums. Coefficients on the plan indicator
variables that appear in bold are statistically different from one another at the 10-percent level, and
provide evidence that the expenditures of people who switched plan types differed from those who
remained, on average.
People who switched from a non-HMO to an HMO plan and had a choice of plan types in the
first round used $210 fewer medical resources in the first round ($1,320 - $1,530) than those who
remained in a non-HMO plan (column 1 of Table 3). However, this difference is not statistically
significant. HMOs, on the other hand, did experience favorable selection because the enrollees who
switched to non-HMO plans in the second round used more medical resources than those who remained
in an HMO. HMO enrollees who switched to a non-HMO in round 2 used $370 more medical services in
round 1 ($1,957 - $1,587), or 18 percent of the mean medical expenditures of HMO enrollees in round 1.
In the second column of Table 3 we add indicator variables for gender and age to see if the
differences in medical utilization between those who do and do not switch plan types are due to
differences in enrollee characteristics that an employer could use to adjust premiums. If those switching

12

13
from a non-HMO to an HMO have lower expenditures because they are male and relatively young,
characteristics associated with lower predicted medical expenditures, then employers could pay plans
relatively low premiums when they enroll these types of workers. Although gender and age do affect first
round medical expenditures, as can be seen in column 2 of Table 3, HMOs would have still experienced
favorable risk selection in a simple risk-adjusted market. Medical expenditures for the HMO enrollees
who switched to a non-HMO are still significantly higher than those who remained ($2,435 vs. $2,058),
even after controlling for gender and age. This implies that selection occurs based on unobserved
preferences for medical care and/or characteristics that are more difficult for employers to observe.
In the third column of Table 3 we include an extensive set of individual and firm characteristics,
such as self-reported health status, marital status, household structure (e.g., married with children), race,
education, household income, type of employer (i.e., private or government), and number of employees at
the person’s firm. When we include these characteristics that may be difficult for a firm to observe in
order to control for enrollee expenditures, neither plan type would experience risk selection.
Does the favorable risk selection for HMOs that we detect have a substantial impact on health
insurers’ financial performance? In our sample there were 609 people who switched from an HMO to a
non-HMO. Based on the second specification from Table 3, these people who switched to a non-HMO
used $377 more medical expenditures in the initial year than those who remained in an HMO, or 18
percent more medical resources than the average HMO enrollee. These 609 people represent 10 percent
of HMO enrollment in round 1 of our sample, so the loss of these relatively expensive HMO enrollees
would be predicted to decrease aggregate HMO medical expenditures by 2.0 percent. Although the
annual impact appears to be small, if this magnitude of risk selection occurred over an extended time
period, it could presumably allow HMOs to charge lower premiums than non-HMO plans and attract
employees who would prefer to enroll in an non-HMO plan under a perfect risk adjustment scheme.
In Table 4 we repeat the analysis presented in Table 3 but we now include eight indicator
variables to examine risk selection separately for people who did and did not have a choice of plan types
in the first round of the survey. We would expect risk selection to be more pronounced for people who

13

14
were initially constrained – their employer offered either an HMO only or a non-HMO only. We find
some evidence supporting this hypothesis. According to column 1 of Table 4, people who switched from
a non-HMO plan and had a choice of plan types in the first round used $526 fewer medical resources in
the first round ($1,121 - $1,647) than those who remained in the non-HMO plan. This difference, which
is 28 percent of the non-HMO average expenditure, is statistically significant at the 5-percent level and
economically significant as well.
The favorable selection for HMOs that we report in Table 3 appears to be concentrated among
people who were offered an HMO only in the first round of the survey. Among people who had no
choice of plan types in round 1 and were in an HMO, those who switched to a non-HMO in round 2 used
$1,000 more medical services in round 1 ($2,475 - $1,475). In the second column of Table 4, when we
control for an enrollee’s gender and age, the adverse selection experienced by non-HMOs and the
favorable selection experienced by HMOs would persist. When we include a more extensive set of risk
adjusters in column 3 of Table 4, HMOs would still experience favorable selection among the enrollees
who did not have a choice of plan types in the first round.
Our analysis indicates that people switching from HMOs to non-HMOs tend to have relatively
high medical expenditures. However, if this expenditure difference is not persistent, then risk selection
may not affect health plan profits and may not cause distortions in plan design. This would be the case if
the switchers’ deviations from average expenditures are due to transitory health shocks that do not persist
in the following years. In Table 5 we present coefficient estimates of the determinants of medical
resource use in the second round of the survey. The structure of the regressions is similar to Table 3 and
the sample consists, as before, of people who had a choice of plan types in the second round.
People who switched from an HMO in round 1 to a non-HMO in round 2 used $119 more
($1,421 - $1,302) medical resources in round 2 than the non-HMO enrollees who remained in a nonHMO. This expenditure difference is not significant in column 1, or in the other columns when we
control for enrollees’ personal characteristics. Therefore, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
enrollees that non-HMO plans acquire from HMOs have the same expenditures as the experienced non-

14

15
HMO enrollees once they join the non-HMO plan. One explanation for this is a regression to the mean:
these people had an acute illness in the initial period, used a relatively large amount of medical resources
in the HMO, became disenchanted with the HMO and switched to a non-HMO in the second period, and
used an average amount of medical resources in the non-HMO when their health returned to its normal
state.
The non-HMO enrollees who switch to an HMO, on the other hand, do use $322 fewer medical
resources ($936 - $1,258) in round 2 than the HMO enrollees who remained in an HMO. This difference
is statistically significant and remains significant when we control for age and gender, which indicates
that the expenditure difference is due to unobserved enrollee characteristics such as preferences for
medical care or health. Even with a simple risk adjustment system, HMOs would appear to be able to
benefit from favorable risk selection. This is a somewhat surprising result because overall, across the
choice and no-choice groups, the non-HMO enrollees who switched to an HMO did use $200 fewer
medical resources than the enrollees who remained in a non-HMO, but this difference was not statistically
significant. Apparently the people who switched to an HMO have persistently lower expenditures,
possibly because they have weaker preferences for medical care and/or their health is positively and
strongly correlated over time. The expenditure difference is slightly smaller in magnitude and statistically
insignificant in the final specification where we include variables that perhaps could not be incorporated
into a feasible risk adjustment system.
Our results, from a national data set, are generally consistent with switcher studies that have used
a single employer or a coalition of employers in a single market, although the magnitude of our effects are
smaller. Altman, Cutler, and Zeckhauser (1998), for example, find that people switching from an
indemnity to an HMO plan spent 36 percent less on medical care than those remaining in the indemnity
plan, and people switching from an HMO to an indemnity plan spent 47 percent more than those who
remained in an HMO. Jackson-Beeck and Kleinman (1983) find that people enrolling in an HMO when it
was offered for the first time had an average of 53 percent fewer hospital days in the indemnity plan
relative to people who remained in the indemnity plan.

15

16
Our finding of favorable risk selection for HMOs differs from the RAND study and the study by
Polsky and Nicholson (2002), studies that estimate average rather than marginal risk selection measures.
As part of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, people were randomized to a Seattle HMO and their
medical utilization was compared to people who chose to enroll in the same HMO. Differences in
utilization would be due, therefore, to differences in the demand for medical care rather than plan design.
Manning et al. (1987) found no difference in the use of medical services between the two groups.
Likewise, Polsky and Nicholson (2002) found no evidence of risk selection using the first wave of the
CTSHS. They decompose differences in expenditures between HMO and non-HMO enrollees into a
utilization, reimbursement, and risk selection effect, where the latter effect is measured as a residual. The
switcher methodology generates a marginal risk selection estimate, since we identify the risk selection
coefficients by the people who switch plan types. If the people who remain in an HMO, for example, use
slightly more medical services than people who remain in a non-HMO, then the average risk selection
measure may in fact be zero.
Another way to analyze risk selection is to see whether non-HMO enrollees with relatively high
medical expenditures in round 1 are more likely to switch to an HMO in round 2, and if HMO enrollees
with relatively low medical expenditures in round 1 are more likely to switch to a non-HMO in round 2
(Call et al., 1999). We examine this issue with descriptive data in Table 6 and with a regression analysis
in Table 7. In the first panel of Table 6 we divide the non-HMO enrollees in round 1 that had a choice of
plan types in round 2 (and thus could choose their preferred plan easily) into six categories according to
their medical expenditures in round 1. Twenty-nine percent of the non-HMO enrollees who did not use
any medical resources in round 1 switched to HMO plans in round 2. In fact, the proportion of non-HMO
enrollees who switched does not differ much across the first five expenditure categories. However, the
non-HMO enrollees in the top expenditure decile, with average medical expenditures in round 1 of
$11,700, were much less likely to switch to an HMO (0.234 versus 0.286 for non-HMO enrollees as a
whole). This is consistent with the anecdotal stories that people with chronic diseases place a great value
on remaining in a health plan that allows greater choice of providers and practices less aggressive

16

17
utilization management. The low likelihood of switching among the heaviest users of medical care seems
sensible because people who use a great deal of medical services are more likely than other enrollees to
learn whether the plan is a good match.
In the second panel of Table 6 we divide the HMO enrollees in round 1 that had a choice of plan
types in round 2 into six categories according to their medical expenditures in round 1. Eighteen percent
of these HMO enrollees switched to a non-HMO plan in the second round. Interestingly, the HMO
enrollees who did not use any medical resources in round 1 were most likely to switch (0.226 versus and
average of 0.184). These enrollees may have switched in part because they were dissatisfied with the
provider network and/or the plan rules. This instance of favorable selection for non-HMOs is
counteracted by adverse selection at the other end of the HMO expenditure distribution. HMO enrollees
in the top decile, who had mean round-1 medical expenditures of $12,500, were more likely to switch to a
non-HMO plan than the average HMO enrollee (0.210 versus 0.184).
In Table 7 we present results of probit regressions where the dependent variable is one if a person
switches plan types between round 1 and round 2, and is a zero otherwise. In the first two columns we
restrict the sample to people enrolled in a non-HMO plan in the first round who also had a choice of plan
types in the second round. In the first column we include an indicator variable for individuals who did
not use any medical care in the first round, a continuous variable of medical expenditures in the first
round, and expenditures squared. None of these coefficients is significant. This is consistent with Table
6, which shows that the proportion of people switching to an HMO was not correlated with use of medical
resources except for enrollees who had about $10,000 of medical expenditures in the first round, and is
also consistent with the results from Table 3, where the non-HMO enrollees switching to HMOs did not
have statistically different expenditures than those remaining in a non-HMO.
When we include indicator variables for a person’s gender and age in column 2, the coefficients
on medical expenditures now indicate whether people who used more medical resources than would be
predicted based on these observable characteristics, were more likely to switch to an HMO. Such would
be the case, for example, if non-HMO enrollees with strong preferences for medical care and poor health

17

18
used a lot of medical care and switched to HMO plans. The insignificant coefficients on the medical
expenditure variables in column 1 and column 2 indicate that medical use is not strongly correlated with
the likelihood that non-HMO enrollees will switch to an HMO plan. The positive coefficients on the age
variables in column 2 demonstrate that relatively young non-HMO enrollees switched to HMO plans in
the second period.
In column 3 and column 4 of Table 7 we present results of probit regressions for the sample of
people who were enrolled in an HMO in round 1 and had a choice of plan types in round 2. The positive
coefficient on the medical expenditures in column 4 indicates that non-HMOs are experiencing adverse
risk selection, and this selection is based on characteristics other than gender and age. That is, HMO
enrollees who used more medical resources than predicted based on their gender and age were more likely
to switch to a non-HMO plan in the second round. However, medical expenditures in round 1 have a
fairly small impact on the likelihood that an HMO enrollee will switch to a non-HMO plan. A onestandard deviation increase in medical expenditures ($4,657) is associated with a 2.5 percentage point
increase in the predicted probability that an HMO enrollee will switch to a non-HMO plan (from 0.184 to
0.209).
The two methods of examining risk selection appear to be producing consistent results. People
who use medical resources relatively intensively are slightly more likely to switch from an HMO to a
non-HMO plan. Since the distribution of medical expenditures is skewed to the right, this small
difference in the likelihood of switching among the heaviest users of medical services can produce fairly
large aggregate differences in medical costs between HMOs and non-HMOs, especially if the risk
selection occurs over multiple years.

Conclusions
Almost all of the existing studies that measure risk selection in the non-elderly, employersponsored health insurance market are case studies of a single employer or employer coalition in a single
market, and most use data from the 1980s or early 1990s. Since many employers have mitigated the

18

19
incentive for health plans to target low-risk enrollees by self-insuring and/or by offering a variety of
health plans from a single insurance company, the results from these case studies may not be
representative of national conditions. In this paper we examine whether HMOs experience favorable risk
selection in the employer-sponsored market by applying a “switcher” methodology to a national, panel
data set of enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans.
We find evidence that HMOs experience favorable selection that would persist even if employers
adjusted health plan premium payments for the enrollees’ gender and age. People who switched from a
non-HMO to an HMO plan used 11 percent fewer medical services in the period prior to switching than
people who remained in the non-HMO plan, and that this low use persists once they enroll in an HMO,
relative to those already enrolled in an HMO. Furthermore, we find that people who switched from an
HMO to a non-HMO plan used 18 percent more medical services in the period prior to switching than
people who remained in the HMO plan. This relatively high use rate does persist once they enroll in the
non-HMO, but the differential is not statistically significant. Ten percent of HMO enrollees switched to a
non-HMO between the first and second round of the CTSHS survey, and their departure is predicted to
reduce an HMO’s aggregate medical expenditures by 2.0 percent. Although the annual impact appears to
be small, if this magnitude of risk selection occurred over an extended time period, it could presumably
allow HMOs to charge lower premiums than non-HMO plans and attract employees who would prefer to
enroll in an non-HMO plan under a perfect risk adjustment scheme.
