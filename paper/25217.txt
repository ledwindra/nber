On the Informativeness of Descriptive Statistics for Structural Estimates

NBER Working Paper No. 25217
November 2018, Revised May 2020
JEL No. C18,D12,I13,I25
ABSTRACT
We propose a way to formalize the relationship between descriptive analysis and structural
estimation. A researcher reports an estimate ĉ of a structural quantity of interest c that is exactly
or asymptotically unbiased under some base model. The researcher also reports descriptive
statistics γ̂ that estimate features γ of the distribution of the data that are related to c under the
base model. A reader entertains a less restrictive model that is local to the base model, under
which the estimate ĉ may be biased. We study the reduction in worst-case bias from a restriction
that requires the reader's model to respect the relationship between c and γ specified by the base
model. Our main result shows that the proportional reduction in worst-case bias depends only on
a quantity we call the informativeness of γ̂ for ĉ. Informativeness can be easily estimated even
for complex models. We recommend that researchers report estimated informativeness alongside
their descriptive analyses, and we illustrate with applications to three recent papers.

Introduction

Empirical researchers often present descriptive statistics alongside structural estimates that answer
policy or counterfactual questions of interest. One leading case is where the structural model is
estimated on data from a randomized experiment, and the descriptive statistics are treatmentcontrol differences (e.g., Attanasio et al. 2012a; Duflo et al. 2012; Alatas et al. 2016). Another
is where the structural model is estimated on observational data, and the descriptive statistics are
regression coefficients or correlations that capture important relationships (e.g., Gentzkow 2007a;
Einav et al. 2013; Gentzkow et al. 2014; Morten 2019). Researchers often provide a heuristic
argument that links the descriptive statistics to key structural estimates, sometimes framing this
as an informal analysis of identification.1
Such descriptive analysis has the potential to make structural estimates more interpretable.
Structural models are often criticized for lacking transparency, with large numbers of assumptions
and a high level of complexity making it difficult for readers to evaluate how the results might
change under plausible forms of misspecification (Heckman 2010; Angrist and Pischke 2010). If
a particular result were mainly driven by some intuitive descriptive features of the data, a reader
could focus on evaluating the assumptions that link those features to the result.
In this paper, we propose a way to make this logic precise. A researcher is interested in a scalar
quantity of interest c (say, the effect of a counterfactual policy). The researcher specifies a base
model that relates the value of c to the distribution F of some data (say, the joint distribution of
the data in a randomized experiment). The researcher reports an estimate ĉ of c that is unbiased
(either exactly or asymptotically) under the base model. A reader of the research may not accept
all of the assumptions of the base model, and may therefore be concerned that ĉ is biased.
The researcher also reports a vector γ̂ of descriptive statistics (say, sample mean outcomes
in different arms of the experiment). These statistics uncontroversially estimate some features
γ = γ (F ) of the distribution F (say, population mean outcomes in different arms). Because the
base model specifies the relationship between c and F , it also implicitly specifies the relationship
between c and γ, which may or may not be correct.
Suppose the researcher is able to convince the reader of the relationship between c and γ specified
by the base model (say, by arguing that the counterfactual policy is similar to one of the arms of
the experiment). Should this lessen the reader’s concern about bias in ĉ, even if the reader does
not accept the base model in its entirety?
We answer this question focusing on the worst-case bias when the alternative model contem1

examples discussed in Andrews et al. (2017, 2020).

plated by the reader is local to the base model in an appropriate sense. To outline our approach,
it will be useful to define the base model as a correspondence F 0 (·), where F 0 (c) is the set of
distributions F consistent with a given value of c under the model. The identified set for c given
some F under the base model is found by taking the preimage of F under F 0 (·). We assume that
c is point identified under the base model, so that for any F consistent with the base model, the
identified set given F is a singleton.
The reader contemplates a model that is less restrictive than the base model. We describe the
reader’s model by a correspondence F N (·), where F N (c) ⊇ F 0 (c) is the set of distributions F
consistent with a given value of c under the reader’s model. Because F N (c) ⊇ F 0 (c) for all c, the
identified set for c given some F is larger under the reader’s model than under the base model, and
may not be a singleton. Moreover, ĉ may be biased under the reader’s model. Let bN denote the
largest possible absolute bias in ĉ that can arise under F N (·), where this bound may be infinite.
To formalize the idea that the reader’s model is local to the base model, we suppose that each
F̃ ∈ F N (c) lies in a neighborhood N (F ) of an F consistent with the base model, so that
(1)

n
o
F N (c) = ∪F ∈F 0 (c) F̃ ∈ N (F ) .

We take the neighborhood N (F ) to contain distributions F̃ within a given statistical distance of
F.
To formalize the possibility that the researcher convinces the reader of the relationship between
c and γ prescribed by the base model, we consider restricting attention to the elements F̃ ∈ N (F )
 
such that γ F̃ = γ (F ). This results in the restricted correspondence F RN (·)
(2)

n
 
o
F RN (c) = ∪F ∈F 0 (c) F̃ ∈ N (F ) : γ F̃ = γ (F ) .

If F 0 (·) implies that only certain values of γ are consistent with a given value of c, then F RN (·)
preserves that implication whereas F N (·) may not. For this reason F N (c) ⊇ F RN (c) ⊇ F 0 (c) for
all c, i.e., the correspondence F RN (·) is less restrictive than the base model, but more restrictive
than the reader’s model. Let bRN denote the largest possible absolute bias in ĉ that can arise under
F RN (·). Because F RN (·) is more restrictive than F N (·), we know that bRN ≤ bN .
We focus on characterizing the ratio bRN /bN , which lies between zero and one. Section 2 shows
how to derive the correspondences F N (·), F RN (·) , and F 0 (·), and the worst-case biases bN and
bRN , from explicitly parameterized economic models. Section 3 provides an exact characterization
of bRN /bN in a linear model with normal errors. Section 4 provides an approximate characterization
of bRN /bN in more general nonlinear models, obtained via a local asymptotic analysis. Sections 3
3

and 4 show that under given conditions the ratio bRN /bN (or its asymptotic analogue) is equal to
√
1 − ∆, where ∆ is a scalar which we call the informativeness of the descriptive statistics γ̂ for the
structural estimate ĉ. Informativeness is the R2 from a regression of the structural estimate on the
descriptive statistics when both are drawn from their joint (asymptotic) distribution. Intuitively,
when informativeness is high, γ̂ captures most of the information in the data that determines ĉ.
We propose informativeness as a way to formalize the colloquial notion of the extent to which γ̂
“drives” ĉ.
Informativeness can be estimated at low cost even for computationally challenging models.
Section 5 shows that a consistent estimator of ∆ can be obtained from manipulation of the estimated
influence functions of ĉ and γ̂. In the large range of settings in which estimated influence functions
are available from the calculations used to obtain ĉ and γ̂, the additional computation required
to estimate ∆ is trivial. We recommend that researchers report an estimate of informativeness
whenever they present descriptive evidence as support for structural estimates.
Section 6 implements our proposal for three recent papers in economics, each of which reports or
discusses descriptive statistics alongside structural estimates. In the first application, to Attanasio
et al. (2012a), the quantity c of interest is the effect of a counterfactual redesign of the PROGRESA
cash transfer program, and the descriptive statistics γ̂ are sample treatment-control differences for
different groups of children. In the second application, to Gentzkow (2007a), the quantity c of
interest is the effect of removing the online edition of the Washington Post on readership of the print
edition, and the descriptive statistics γ̂ are linear regression coefficients. In the third application,
to Hendren (2013a), the quantity c of interest is a parameter governing the existence of insurance
markets, and the descriptive statistics γ̂ summarize the joint distribution of self-reported beliefs
about the likelihood of loss events and the realizations of these events. In each case, we report an
estimate of ∆ for various definitions of γ̂, and we discuss the implications for the interpretation
of ĉ. These applications illustrate how estimates of ∆ can be presented and discussed in applied
research.
Important limitations of our analysis include the use of asymptotic approximations to describe
the behavior of estimators, and the use of a purely statistical notion of distance to define sets of
alternative models. Ideally one would like to use exact finite-sample properties to characterize the
bias of estimators, and economic knowledge to define sets of alternative models. We are not aware
of convenient procedures that achieve this ideal in the generality that we consider. We therefore
propose the use of informativeness as a practical option to improve the precision of discussions of
the connection between descriptive statistics and structural estimates in applied research.
Our results are related to Andrews et al. (2017). In that paper, we propose a measure Λ of the

4

sensitivity of a parameter estimate ĉ to a vector of statistics γ̂, focusing on the case where γ̂ are
estimation moments that fully determine the estimator ĉ (and so ∆ = 1).2 In Online Appendix A,
we generalize our main result to accommodate the setting of Andrews et al. (2017) and so provide
a unified treatment of sensitivity and informativeness.
In a related paper, Mukhin (2018) derives informativeness and sensitivity from a statisticalgeometric perspective, and notes strong connections to semiparameteric efficiency theory. Mukhin
also shows how to derive sensitivity and informativeness measures based on alternative metrics for
the distance between distributions, and discusses the use of these measures for local counterfactual
analysis.
Our work is also closely related to the large literature on local misspecification (e.g., Newey 1985;
Conley et al. 2012; Andrews et al. 2017). Much of this literature focuses on testing and confidence
set construction (e.g. Berkowitz et al. 2008; Guggenberger 2012; Armstrong and Kolesár, 2019) or
robust estimation (e.g., Rieder 1994; Kitamura et al. 2013; Bonhomme and Weidner 2018). Rieder
(1994) studies the choice of target parameters and proposes optimal robust testing and estimation
procedures under forms of local misspecification including the one that we consider here. Bonhomme
and Weidner (2018) derive minimax robust estimators and accompanying confidence intervals for
economic parameters of interest under a form of local misspecification closely related to the one we
study. Armstrong and Kolesár (2019) consider a class of ways in which the model may be locally
misspecified that nests the one we consider, derive minimax optimal confidence sets, and show that
there is limited scope to improve on their procedures by “estimating” the degree of misspecification,
motivating a sensitivity analysis. In contrast to this literature, we focus on characterizing the
relationship between a set of descriptive statistics and a given structural estimator, with the goal of
allowing readers of applied research to sharpen their opinions about the reliability of the researcher’s
conclusions, thus improving transparency in the sense of Andrews et al. (2020).
Our use of statistical distance to characterize the degree of misspecification relates to a number
of recent papers. Our results cover the Cressie-Read (1984) family, which nests widely studied
measures including the Kullback-Leibler divergence, Hellinger divergence, and many others, up to
a monotone transformation. Kullback-Leibler divergence has been used to measure the degree of
misspecification by, for example, Hansen and Sargent (2001), Hansen and Sargent (2005), Hansen et
al. (2006), Hansen and Sargent (2016), and Bonhomme and Weidner (2018). Hellinger divergence
has been used by, for example, Kitamura et al. (2013).
Finally, our work relates to discussions about the appropriate role of descriptive statistics in
structural econometric analysis (e.g., Pakes 2014).3 It is common in applied research to describe

The present paper draws on the analysis of “sensitivity to descriptive statistics” in Gentzkow and Shapiro (2015).
See also Dridi et al. (2007) and Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) for discussion of the appropriate choice of

5

the data features that “primarily identify” structural parameters or “drive” estimates of those parameters.4 As Keane (2010) and others have noted, such statements are not directly related to
the formal notion of identification in econometrics (see also Andrews et al. 2020). Their intended
meaning is therefore up for grabs. If researchers are prepared to reinterpret these as statements
about informativeness, then our approach provides a way to sharpen and quantify these statements
at low cost to researchers.

Setup and Key Definitions

The introduction describes our approach in terms of correspondences between the quantity of
interest c and the distribution F of the data. In this section we first show how to derive these correspondences from explicitly parameterized economic models, and then use these correspondences
to define the worst-case biases that we characterize in our analysis. Section 4 defines analogous
objects in a local asymptotic framework.
Suppose that, under the base model considered by the researcher, both the distribution of the
data F and the quantity of interest c are determined by a structural parameter η ∈ H. Formally,
under the base model, we have that F = F (η) and c = c (η) so the correspondence F 0 (·) is given
by
F 0 (c) = {F (η) : η ∈ H, c (η) = c} .
Because the structural parameter η determines the distribution F , it also determines γ = γ (η) =
γ (F (η)).
Suppose further that, under the reader’s model, the distribution of the data F is determined
by η and by a misspecification parameter ζ ∈ Z (say, indexing economic forces omitted from the
researcher’s model) that is normalized to zero under the base model. Formally, under the reader’s
model we have that F = F (η, ζ), with F (η, 0) = F (η) for all η ∈ H, and correspondingly that
γ = γ (η, ζ) = γ (F (η, ζ)), with γ (η, 0) = γ (η) for all η ∈ H. We focus on settings where forms of
misspecification indexed by ζ are rich, in the sense that the range of F (η, ζ) under ζ ∈ Z does not
depend on η. For simplicity we continue to write the quantity of interest as a function of η alone,
c = c (η). Forms of misspecification that affect the mapping from η to c but preserve its range are
equivalent to those we study.5
moments to match when fitting macroeconomic models.

Andrews et al. (2017, footnotes 2 and 3) provide examples.
5
Specifically, consider a model where the distribution of the data is F = F (η, ζ) as above, while the quantity of
interest is c = c̃ (η, ζ), and the range of c̃ (η, ζ) under η ∈ H for any ζ ∈ Z is the same as that of c (η) under η ∈ H. In
this case, the sets {(c (η) , F (η, ζ)) : η ∈ H, ζ ∈ Z} and {(c̃ (η, ζ) , F (η, ζ)) : η ∈ H, ζ ∈ Z} are both Cartesian products, equal to {c (η) : η ∈ H} × {F (η, ζ) : η ∈ H, ζ ∈ Z}. Consequently, the correspondences F (·) that we consider

6

We formalize the idea that the reader’s model is local to the base model as follows. Let r (η, ζ) ≥
0 denote some Cressie-Read (1984) divergence between the distribution F (η) and the distribution
F (η, ζ), so that r (η, 0) = 0 for all η ∈ H. For any distribution F = F (η) consistent with the
base model, we define the neighborhood N (F ) to consist of all distributions F (η, ζ) such that the
divergence r (η, ζ) is less than some scalar bound µ ≥ 0:
N (F ) = {F (η, ζ) : η ∈ H, F (η) = F, ζ ∈ Z, r (η, ζ) ≤ µ} .
We then define the reader’s model F N (·) as in (1).6 The neighborhood N (F ) is increasing in µ.
Hence, larger values of µ imply imply a greater relaxation of assumptions as we move from the base
model F 0 (·) to the reader’s model F N (·) . We suppress the dependence of N (F ) and F N (c) on µ
for brevity.
The base model specifies a relationship between c and γ in the sense that if the quantity of interest takes value c, then the feature γ must take a value γ (η) for some η ∈ H such that c = c (η). The
reader’s model F N (·) need not respect the base model’s specification of the relationship between
c and γ. By contrast, the model F RN (·), defined in (2), respects the base model’s specification of
the relationship between c and γ in the sense that, for any F ∈ F RN (c), there is some η ∈ H such
that c = c (η), γ (F ) = γ (η), and F ∈ N (F (η)) .7 Hence, a given (c, γ) pair is compatible with
F RN (·) if and only if it is compatible with F 0 (·) .
The researcher chooses an estimator ĉ that is unbiased under the base model in the sense
that EF [ĉ − c] = 0 for any F ∈ F 0 (c), where EF [·] denotes the expectation when the data are
distributed according to F . The estimator ĉ may be biased under the reader’s model F N (·), and
indeed if we take µ to infinity the parameter c is completely unidentified under F N (·). The largest
absolute bias in ĉ that is possible under F N (·) is
bN = sup

Specifically, F N (c) = {F (η, ζ) : η ∈ H, c (η) = c, ζ ∈ Z, r (η, ζ) ≤ µ} .

Informativeness in a Linear Normal Setting

To build intuition for our approach, we next specialize to a linear normal setting and provide an
exact characterization of the ratio bRN /bN . We illustrate with a stylized example, and conclude
the section with some further discussion of our approach and its limitations.

3.1

Characterization of Worst-Case Bias

Now suppose that H = Rp , Z = Rk , and that under F (η, ζ) the data Y ∈ Rk follow
Y ∼ N (Xη + ζ, Ω)

(3)

for X and Ω known, nonrandom matrices with full column rank.
The quantity of interest is some linear function c (η) = L0 η of the parameters, with L ∈ Rp×1 a
known, non-random vector. The researcher chooses a linear estimator ĉ = C 0 Y for C a vector. The
researcher ensures that ĉ is unbiased for c under F 0 (·) by choosing C 0 = L0 M for some matrix M
with M X = Ip .
The researcher computes the vector γ̂ = Γ0 Y of descriptive statistics, with Γ ∈ Rk×pγ a known,
non-random matrix. The vector γ̂ is trivially unbiased for γ (η, ζ) = Γ0 (Xη + ζ).
Absent any restriction on ζ the quantity of interest c is entirely unidentified. Intuitively, without
any restriction on ζ, the mean of the data Y is entirely unrestricted for any fixed η, making it
impossible to learn c = L0 η. The reader’s model F N (·) limits the size of ζ. In particular, given (3),
the assumption that r (·, ·) is in the Cressie-Read family implies that r (η, ζ) is a strictly increasing

Informativeness is the R2 from the population regression of ĉ on γ̂ under their joint distribution.
Informativeness determines the ratio of worst-case biases bRN /bN .
Proposition 1. The set of possible biases under F N (·) is

All proofs are collected at the end of the paper.
Importantly, the value of ∆, and hence the proportional reduction in worst-case bias from
restricting from F N (·) to F RN (·), does not depend on µ. In addition to characterizing the worstcase biases bRN and bN , Proposition 1 characterizes the set of possible biases under F N (·) and
F RN (·), showing in particular that any absolute bias smaller than the worst case is achievable.
Imposing additional restrictions on ζ, beyond those captured by F N (·) or F RN (·), could further
reduce the worst-case bias.

3.2

Example

To fix ideas, suppose that a researcher observes i.i.d. data from a randomized evaluation of a
conditional cash transfer program. The program gives each household a payment of size s if their
children attend school regularly. Households are uniformly randomized among subsidy levels s ∈
{0, 1, 2}. We can think of those receiving s = 0 as the control group.
The data consist of the average school attendance Ys of children assigned subsidy s ∈ {0, 1, 2}.
The quantity of interest c is the expected attendance at a counterfactual subsidy level s∗ > 2.

9

Under the base model the mean of Ys is given by
(4)

η1 + η2 s

for s ∈ {0, 1, 2, s∗ }. Average attendance Ys is independent and homoskedastic across arms of the
experiment, with standard deviation ω.9
Under the base model F 0 (·), c can be estimated by linear extrapolation of average attendance
from two or more of the observed subsidy levels s ∈ {0, 1, 2} to subsidy level s∗ . We continue to
assume that the researcher chooses a linear estimator ĉ that is unbiased for c under F 0 (·).10
Under the reader’s model F N (·), the estimator ĉ may be biased. Intuitively, if ζ 6= 0 then
the mean of Ys may be nonlinear in s, so that linear extrapolation to s∗ may produce a biased
estimate of c. The restriction to F RN (·) can lessen the scope for bias. The economic content of the
restriction depends on the choice of Γ, which in turn determines the descriptive statistic γ̂ = Γ0 Y
and the informativeness ∆.
As a concrete example, suppose that a reader entertains that the effect of incentivizing school
attendance may be discontinuous at zero, with the mean of Ys for s ∈ {0, 1, 2, s∗ } given by
η̃0 + 1 {s > 0} η̃1 + sη̃2

(5)

for η̃ a composite of η and ζ with η̃1 6= 0.11 The model F N (·) allows that the mean of Ys may follow
(5), as long as η̃1 is sufficiently small.12 The bound bN thus reflects a worst case over scenarios that
include (5).
Whether the set F RN (·) allows that the mean of Ys may follow (5) depends on the choice of


Γ. If Γ = e1 e2 for es the basis vector corresponding to subsidy s, so that γ̂ = Y1 Y2 ,
then under F RN (·) the mean of Ys is linear in s for s > 0, which is consistent with (5). If instead

Discussion
Relationship to Analysis of Identification

Our analysis is distinct from an analysis of identification. We focus on the behavior of a particular
estimator ĉ under misspecification, taking as given that c is identified under the base model. This
is distinct from asking whether the identification of c is parametric or nonparametric, and from
asking how the identified set changes under misspecification. To see the latter point, consider a case
where γ̂ is an unbiased estimator of c under F 0 (·), but differs from ĉ.13 An analysis of identification
would conclude that c is point-identified under F RN (·), whereas our analysis would conclude that
the estimator ĉ may be biased under F RN (·).
We can connect our analysis to an analysis of identification if we consider identification from
the distribution of ĉ alone. In particular, Proposition 1 implies that the identified set for c based on


√
√
the distribution of ĉ is [ĉ − µσc , ĉ + µσc ] under F N (·) and ĉ − µσc 1 − ∆, ĉ + µσc 1 − ∆ under
F RN (·). Under this interpretation, the ratio bRN /bN measures how much the identified set shrinks
when we restrict from F N (·) to F RN (·).
3.3.2

Interpretation and Limitations

We pause here to discuss some other aspects and limitations of our approach.
First, our analysis focuses on bounding the absolute bias of the estimator ĉ. Since the variance
of ĉ is unaffected by misspecification, there is a one-to-one relationship between absolute bias and
MSE. So, for fixed µ, ∆ governs the extent to which restricting from F N (·) to F RN (·) reduces the
maximal MSE for ĉ. Unlike for absolute bias, however, the ratio of worst-case MSEs under F N (·)
and F RN (·) depends in general on µ.
13

For instance, γ̂ might be an estimator based on matching a statistically non-sufficient set of moments, while ĉ
might be the maximum likelihood estimator.

11

Second, the correspondence F RN (·) requires that the relationship between c and γ specified
by the base model be correct local to each point in the base model. This is more restrictive
than requiring that the pair (c, γ) be globally consistent with the base model, which yields the
correspondence F GN (·) with
(6)

o


 
n
F GN (c) = F N (c) ∩ ∪F ∗ ∈F 0 (c) F̃ : γ F̃ = γ (F ∗ )

for all c. If any (c, γ) pair is possible under F 0 (·), then F GN (·) is equivalent to F N (·), but F RN (·)
need not be. More generally F N (c) ⊇ F GN (c) ⊇ F RN (c) ⊇ F 0 (c), and the ratio of worst case
√
bias under F GN (·) to worst-case bias under F N (·) is bounded below by 1 − ∆.
Third, we see the use of statistical distance to define the neighborhoods N (F ) as a key potential
limitation of our analysis. While defining neighborhoods in this way provides a practical default for
many situations, it also means that the informativeness ∆ depends on the sampling process that
generates the data. To illustrate, suppose we are interested in estimating the average treatment
effect c of some policy, that ĉ is a treatment-control difference from an RCT, and that γ̂ is the control
group mean from the same RCT. If the control group is much larger than the treatment group,
variability in ĉ will primarily be driven by the treatment group mean, and the informativeness of γ̂
for ĉ will be low. If, on the other hand, the control group is much smaller than the treatment group,
variability in ĉ will primarily be driven by the control group mean, and the informativeness of γ̂
for ĉ will be high. Thus, the informativeness of the control group mean for the average treatment
effect estimate in this setting depends on features of the experimental design, and not solely on
economic objects such as the distribution of potential outcomes.

Informativeness Under Local Misspecification

This section translates our results on finite-sample bias in the linear normal model to results on
asymptotic bias in nonlinear models with local misspecification. We first introduce our asymptotic
setting and state regularity conditions. We then prove our main result under local misspecification,
develop intuition for the local misspecification neighborhoods we consider, and discuss a version of
our analysis based on probability limits.
We assume that a researcher observes an i.i.d. sample Di ∈ D for i = 1, ..., n. The researcher
considers a base model which implies that Di ∼ F (η), for η ∈ H a potentially infinite-dimensional
parameter. The implied joint distribution for the sample is ×ni=1 F (η). The parameter of interest
remains c (η) . The researcher computes (i) a scalar estimate ĉ of c and (ii) a pγ × 1 vector of
descriptive statistics γ̂.
12

As in Section 2, to allow the possibility of misspecification we suppose that under the reader’s
model Di ∼ F (η, ζ) for some (η, ζ) ∈ H × Z, where F (η, 0) = F (η) for all η ∈ H. The joint
distribution for the sample under the reader’s model is ×ni=1 F (η, ζ). Defining the correspondences
F N (·) and F RN (·) as in Section 2, we are interested in the ratio of worst-case biases bRN /bN .
While Section 3 exactly characterizes bRN /bN in the linear normal model, we are not aware of
similarly tractable expressions in general nonlinear settings. In this section, we therefore instead
approximate bRN /bN by characterizing the first-order asymptotic bias of the estimator ĉ under
sequences of data generating processes in which (η, ζ) approaches a base value (η0 , 0) ∈ H × Z at
a root-n rate.
Formally, define H and Z as sets of values such that for any h ∈ H and z ∈ Z, we have
η0 + th ∈ H and tz ∈ Z for t ∈ R sufficiently close to zero.14 For Fh,z (th , tz ) = F (η0 + th h, tz z),
we consider behavior under sequences of data generating processes

The statement that (η, ζ) approaches (η0 , 0) at a root-n rate should not be taken literally to
imply that the data generating process depends on the sample size, but is instead a device to approximate the finite-sample behavior of estimators in situations where the influence of misspecification
is on the same order as sampling uncertainty.15 Section 4.4 instead considers fixed misspecification
and develops results based on probability limits.
Throughout our analysis, we state assumptions in terms of the base distribution F0 = F (η0 ) .
If these assumptions hold for all η0 ∈ H then our local asymptotic approximations are valid local
to any point in the base model, though many of the asymptotic quantities we consider will depend
on the value of η0 . Section 5 discusses consistent estimators of these quantities that do not require
a priori knowledge of η0 .

4.1

Regularity Conditions

We next discuss a set of regularity conditions used in our asymptotic results. Our first assumption
requires that ĉ and γ̂ behave, asymptotically, like sample averages.

14

For η0 + th 6∈ H or tz 6∈ Z we may define distributions arbitrarily.
The order √1n perturbation to the base-model parameter η is a common asymptotic tool to analyze the local
behavior of estimators (see for example Chapters 7-9 of van der Vaart, 1998). Setting the degree of misspecification
proportional to √1n is likewise a common technique for modeling local misspecification (see e.g. Newey (1985),
Andrews et al. (2017), and Armstrong and Kolesár (2019)).

Σ is finite, σc2 > 0, and Σγγ is positive-definite.
The functions φc (Di ) and φγ (Di ) are called the influence functions for the estimators ĉ and
γ̂, respectively. Asymptotic linearity of the form in (7) holds for a wide range of estimators (see
e.g. Ichimura and Newey 2015), though it can fail for James-Stein, LASSO, and other shrinkage
estimators (e.g. Hansen 2016). Asymptotic linearity immediately implies that ĉ and γ̂ are jointly
asymptotically normal under S (0, 0).
We next strengthen asymptotic normality of (ĉ, γ̂) to hold local to η0 under the base model.
We impose the following.
Assumption 2. Let γ (η) denote the probability limit of γ̂ under ×ni=1 F (η), and assume that for


all h ∈ H, γ (η0 + th) exists for t sufficiently close to zero. For any h ∈ H, cn (h) = c η0 + √1n h ,

and γn (h) = γ η0 + √1n h , under S (h, 0) we have

The first part of Assumption 2 requires that cn (h) and γn (h) be asymptotically well-behaved, in
the sense that with appropriate recentering and scaling they converge to limits that can be written
as functions of h. Under this assumption, we can interpret c? (h) as the local parameter of interest,
playing the same role in our local asymptotic analysis as the parameter c does in the normal model.
The second part of Assumption 2 requires that (ĉ, γ̂) be a regular estimator of (c (η) , γ (η)) at η0
under the base model (see e.g., Newey 1994), and is again satisfied under mild primitive conditions

14

in a wide range of settings. In particular, this assumption implies that ĉ is asymptotically unbiased
for our local parameter of interest c? (h) under S (h, 0).
We next assume the distributions F (η, ζ) have densities f (d; η, ζ) with respect to a common
dominating measure ν. For (th , tz ) ∈ R2 , if we consider the perturbed distributions Fh,z (th , tz )
with densities fh,z (d; th , tz ) then the information matrix for (th , tz ), treating (h, z) as known, is

We consider the two-dimensional submodels obtained by fixing (h, z), Fh,z (th , tz ) : (th , tz ) ∈ R2 ,
and impose a sufficient condition for these models to be differentiable in quadratic mean at zero.
Assumption 3. For all h ∈ H, z ∈ Z, there exists an open neighborhood of zero such that for
p
(th , tz ) in this neighborhood, (i) fh,z (d; th , tz ) is continuously differentiable with respect to (th , tz )
for all d ∈ D and (ii) Ih,z (th , tz ) is finite and continuous in (th , tz ).
Assumption 3 imposes standard conditions used in deriving asymptotic results, and holds in a
wide variety of settings; see Chapter 7.2 of van der Vaart (1998) for further discussion.
Finally, we require that the forms of misspecification we consider be sufficiently rich. To state
this assumption, let us define sh (d) =

∂
∂th

log (fh,z (d; 0, 0)), sz (d) =

∂
∂tz

log (fh,z (d; 0, 0)) as the

score functions corresponding to h and z, respectively.
Assumption 4. The set of score functions sz (·) includes all those consistent with Assumption 3,
h
i
in the sense that for any s (·) with EF0 [s (Di )] = 0 and EF0 s (Di )2 < ∞ there exists z ∈ Z with
h
i
EF0 (s (Di ) − sz (Di ))2 = 0.
Assumption 4 requires that the set of score functions sz (Di ) implied by z ∈ Z include all those
consistent with Assumption 3.16 Intuitively, this means that the set of nesting model distributions
holding η fixed at η0 , {F (η0 , ζ) : ζ ∈ Z}, looks (locally) like the set of all distributions, and so is
the local analogue of the richness condition discussed in Section 2. If this assumption fails, the
local asymptotic bias bounds we derive below continue to hold, but need not be sharp.
Under Assumption 4, the nesting model allows forms of misspecification against which all specification tests that control size have trivial local asymptotic power.17 This highlights an important
16
That the score function sz (Di ) has mean zero and finite variance under Assumption 3 follows from Lemma 7.6
and Theorem 7.2 in van der Vaart (1998).


17
In particular, for h ∈ H, Assumption 4 implies that there exists z ∈ Z such that EF0 (sh (Di ) − sz (Di ))2 = 0.
Arguments along the same lines as e.g. Chen and Santos (2018) then imply that S (h, 0) and S (0, z) are asymptotically
indistinguishable, and thus that no specification test which controls the rejection probability under S (h, 0) has
nontrivial power against S (0, z).

15

aspect of our local analysis. A possible justification for bounding the degree of misspecification
(see, e.g., Huber and Ronchetti 2009, p. 294, as quoted in Bonhomme and Weidner 2018) is that
specification tests eventually detect unbounded misspecification with arbitrarily high probability, so
conditional on non-rejection it is reasonable to focus on bounded, and in particular local, misspecification. By contrast, we allow some forms of misspecification that are statistically undetectable
absent knowledge of the true parameters. Hence, restrictions on the magnitude of misspecification
in our setting should be understood as a-priori restrictions on the set of models considered, rather
than a-posteriori restrictions based on which models survive specification tests.

4.2

Main Result Under Local Misspecification

We can now derive the analogue of Proposition 1 in our local asymptotic framework. As a first
√
step, we note that under our assumptions, n (ĉ − c (η0 ) , γ̂ − γ (η0 )) is asymptotically normal with
variance Σ. Moreover, we obtain a simple expression for its asymptotic mean.
Lemma 1. If Assumptions 1-3 hold, then under S (h, z) for any (h, z) ∈ H × Z,

Moreover, c? (h) = EF0 [φc (Di ) sh (Di )], and γ ? (h) = EF0 [φγ (Di ) sh (Di )] .
Recall that c? (h) is the parameter of interest in our local asymptotic analysis. We can thus
interpret c̄ (S (h, z)) − c? (h) = EF0 [φc (Di ) sz (Di )] as the first-order asymptotic bias of ĉ under
S (h, z), analogous to EF [ĉ − c] under the normal model.
As in the normal model we restrict the degree of misspecification. We first consider the case of
correct specification. Let
S 0 (c? ) = {S (h, 0) : h ∈ H, c? (h) = c? }
denote the set of sequences in the base model such that the local parameter of interest takes value
c? . Limiting attention to sequences S ∈ S 0 (c? ) imposes correct specification, and is analogous to
limiting attention to F 0 (c).
To relax the assumption of correct specification, next suppose we bound the degree of local

Non-Local Misspecification

To clarify the role of local misspecification in our results it is helpful to consider the analogue of ∆
under non-local misspecification. Suppose now that the reader believes the data follow ×ni=1 F (η, ζ),
where (η, ζ) do not change with the sample size. Let us denote the probability limits of ĉ and γ̂
under F by c̃ (F ) and γ (F ) , respectively. We assume for ease of exposition that these probability
limits exist.
To simplify the analysis, let us further fix a value η0 of the base model parameter, so the true
value of the parameter of interest is c (η0 ). Suppose that for a divergence r of the form considered

and

in Section 4.3, r (η, ζ) = EF (η,0) [ψ (f (Di ; η, ζ) /f (Di ; η, 0))], the reader believes that the degree of
misspecification is bounded in the sense that r (η0 , ζ) ≤ µ. Given this bound, the probability limit
of |ĉ − c (η0 )| is no larger than
b̃N (µ) = sup {|c̃ (F (η0 , ζ)) − c (η0 )| : ζ ∈ Z, r (η0 , ζ) ≤ µ} ,
where we now make the dependence on µ explicit. This is a non-local analogue of the bias bound
b?N , fixing η = η0 . We can likewise bound the probability limit of |ĉ − c (η0 )| under an analogue of
F RN (·),
b̃RN (µ) = sup {|c̃ (F (η0 , ζ)) − c (η0 )| : ζ ∈ Z, r (η0 , ζ) ≤ µ, γ (F (η0 , ζ)) − γ (F0 ) = 0} .
This is a non-local analogue of bias bound b?RN , again fixing η = η0 .

Implementation with Minimum Distance Estimators

We have so far imposed only high-level assumptions (specifically Assumptions 1 and 5) on ĉ, γ̂,
and Σ̂. While these high-level assumptions hold in a wide range of settings, minimum distance
estimation is an important special case that encompasses a large number of applications. To
facilitate application of our results, in this section we discuss estimation of Σ in cases where c (η)
can be written as a function of a finite-dimensional vector of parameters that are estimated by GMM
or another minimum distance approach (Newey and McFadden 1994), and γ̂ is likewise estimated
via minimum distance.
Formally, suppose that we can decompose η = (θ, ω) where θ is finite-dimensional and c (η)
depends on η only through θ, so we can write it as c (θ). We assume that c (θ) is continuously
differentiable in θ.

If ĝ (θ) and m̂ (γ) are not continuously differentiable, as sometimes occurs for simulation-based estimators, we
can estimate G and M in other ways. For example, we can estimate the jth column of G by the finite difference

Applications

In this section we present and interpret estimates of ∆ for three structural articles in economics,
each of which estimates the parameters η of a base model via maximum likelihood. In each case,
we estimate the informativeness of each vector γ̂ for the estimator ĉ following the recipe in Section
5.1. Because in each case model estimation is via maximum likelihood and γ̂ can be represented as
GMM, the recipe applies directly.

The Effects of PROGRESA

Attanasio et al. (2012a) use survey data from Mexico to study the effect of PROGRESA, a randomized social experiment involving a conditional cash transfer aimed in part at increasing persistence
20

Note that in cases where the function c (θ) depends on features of the data beyond θ, for example on the
distribution of covariates, our formulation implicitly treats those features as fixed at their sample values for the
purposes of estimating ∆. Online Appendix E discusses how to account for such additional dependence on the data,
and presents corresponding calculations for some of our applications.

in school. The paper uses the estimated base model to predict the effect of a counterfactual intervention in which total school enrollment is increased via a budget-neutral reallocation of program
funds.
The estimate of interest ĉ is the partial-equilibrium effect of the counterfactual rebudgeting on
the school enrollment of eligible children, accumulated across age groups (Attanasio et al. 2012a,
sum of ordinates for the line labeled “fixed wages” in Figure 2, minus sum of ordinates for the line
labeled “fixed wages” in the left-hand panel of Figure 1).
Attanasio et al. (2012a) discuss the “exogenous variability in [their] data that drives [their]
results” as follows (p. 53):
The comparison between treatment and control villages and between eligible and
ineligible households within these villages can only identify the effect of the existence
of the grant. However, the amount of the grant varies by the grade of the child. The
fact that children of different ages attend the same grade offers a source of variation
of the amount that can be used to identify the effect of the size of the grant. Given
the demographic variables included in our model and given our treatment for initial
conditions, this variation can be taken as exogenous. Moreover, the way that the grant
amount changes with grade varies in a non-linear way, which also helps identify the
effect.
Thus, the effect of the grant is identified by comparing across treatment and control
villages, by comparing across eligible and ineligible households (having controlled for
being “non-poor”), and by comparing across different ages within and between grades.
(p. 53)
Motivated by this discussion, we define three vectors γ̂ of descriptive statistics, which correspond
to sample treatment-control differences from the experimental data. The first vector (“impact
on eligibles”) consists of the age-grade-specific treatment-control differences for eligible children
(interacting elements of Attanasio et al. 2012a, Table 2, single-age rows of the column labeled
“Impact on Poor 97,” with the child’s grade). The second vector (“impact on ineligibles”) consists
of the age-grade-specific treatment-control differences for ineligible children (interacting elements
of Attanasio et al. 2012a, Table 2, single-age rows of the column labeled “Impact on non-eligible,”
with the child’s grade). The third vector consists of both of these groups of statistics.
Table I reports the estimated informativeness of each vector of descriptive statistics. The
estimated informativeness for the combined vector is 0.28. This is largely accounted for by the
age-grade-specific treatment-control differences for eligible children.

1 − 0.28 ≈ 0.15 in the sense of Proposition 2. Further reduction in the worst-case bias would

require including in γ̂ descriptive statistics that are orthogonal to the treatment-control differences
we consider, thus imposing that F RN (·) respects the relationship specified by the base model F 0 (·)
between c and the features of the distribution of the data estimated by these orthogonal statistics.
To illustrate the distinction between informativeness and identification highlighted in Section
3.3.1, now let c be the partial-equilibrium effect of the actual program on the school enrollment of
eligible children, accumulated across age groups. The parameter c is nonparametrically identified,
and can be nonparametrically estimated by comparing the school enrollment of eligible children in
treatment and control villages (as in Attanasio et al. 2012a, Table 2, column labeled “Impact on
Poor 97”). The parameter c can also be estimated parametrically using the researcher’s estimated
model (as in Attanasio et al. 2012a, sum of ordinates for the line labeled “fixed wages” in the
left-hand panel of Figure 1). The descriptive statistics γ̂ have an informativeness of 1 for a natural
nonparametric estimator, and an estimated informativeness of 0.31 for the parametric estimator,
indicating that assumptions beyond those required for nonparametric identification are necessary
to guarantee that the parametric estimator is unbiased in the sense of Proposition 2.

Newspaper Demand

Gentzkow (2007a) uses survey data from a cross-section of individuals to estimate demand for print
and online newspapers in Washington DC. A central goal of Gentzkow’s (2007a) paper is to estimate
the extent to which online editions of papers crowd out readership of the associated print editions,
which in turn depends on a key parameter governing the extent of print-online substitutability.
The estimate of interest ĉ is the change in readership of the Washington Post print edition that
would occur if the Post online edition were removed from the choice set (Gentzkow 2007a, Table
10, row labeled “Change in Post readership”).
Gentzkow (2007a) discusses two features of the data that can help to distinguish correlated
tastes from true substitutability: (i) a set of instruments—such as a measure of Internet access
at work—that plausibly shift the utility of online papers but do not otherwise affect the utility of
print papers; and (ii) a coarse form of panel data—separate measures of consumption in the last
day and last five weekdays—that make it possible to relate changes in consumption of the print
edition to changes in consumption of the online edition over time for the same individual (p. 730).
Motivated by Gentzkow’s (2007a) discussion, we define three vectors γ̂ of descriptive statistics.
The first vector (“IV coefficient”) is the coefficient from a 2SLS regression of last-five-weekday
print readership on last-five-weekday online readership, instrumenting for the latter with the set of
instruments (Gentzkow 2007a, Table 4, Column 2, first row). The second vector (“panel coefficient”)
is the coefficient from an OLS regression of last-one-day print readership on last-one-day online
readership controlling for the full set of interactions between indicators for print readership and
indicators for online readership in the last five weekdays. Each of these regressions includes the
standard set of demographic controls from Gentzkow (2007a, Table 5). The third vector γ̂ consists
of both the IV coefficient and the panel coefficient. Thus, the first two vectors have dimension 1,
and the third has dimension 2.
Table II reports the estimated informativeness of each vector of descriptive statistics. The
estimated informativeness of the combined vector is 0.51. This is accounted for almost entirely by
the panel coefficient, which alone has an estimated informativeness of 0.50. The IV coefficient, by
contrast, has an estimated informativeness of only 0.01.
Gentzkow’s (2007a) discussion of identification highlights both the exclusion restrictions underlying the IV coefficient and the panel variation underlying the panel coefficient as potential sources
of identification, and if anything places more emphasis on the former. Based on Gentzkow’s (2007a)
discussion, and the large literature showing that exclusion restrictions can be used to establish nonparametric identification in closely related models (Matzkin 2007), it is tempting to conclude that
accepting the relationship specified by the base model between the counterfactual c and the pop25

Our findings suggest otherwise. When γ̂ consists only of the IV coefficient, restricting from
√
(·) to F RN (·) reduces the worst-case bias in ĉ by an estimated factor of only 1− 1 − 0.01 < 0.01

in the sense of Proposition 2. By contrast, when γ̂ consists only of the panel coefficient, restricting
√
from F N (·) to F RN (·) reduces the worst-case bias in ĉ by an estimated factor of 1 − 1 − 0.50 ≈
0.29. Intuitively, a reader interested in evaluating the scope for bias in ĉ may wish to focus more
attention on the assumptions of the base model that relate c to the population value of the panel
coefficient (e.g., restrictions on the time structure of preference shocks), than on assumptions that
relate c to the population value of the IV coefficient (e.g., exclusion restrictions).

Long-term Care Insurance

Hendren (2013a) uses data on insurance eligibility and self-reported beliefs about the likelihood of
different types of “loss” events (e.g., becoming disabled) to recover the distribution of underlying
beliefs and rationalize why some groups are routinely denied insurance coverage. We focus here on
Hendren’s (2013a) model of the market for long-term care (LTC) insurance.
The estimate of interest ĉ is the minimum pooled price ratio among rejectees (Hendren 2013a,
Table V, row labeled “Reject,” column labeled “LTC”). The minimum pooled price ratio determines

the range of preferences for which insurance markets cannot exist (Hendren 2013a, Corollary 2 to
Theorem 1). This ratio is a key output of the analysis, as it provides an economic rationale for the
insurance denials that are the paper’s focus.
Hendren (2013a) explains that the parameters that determine the minimum pooled price ratio
are identified from the relationship between elicited beliefs and the eventual realization of loss events
such as long term care (pp. 1751-2).
Motivated by Hendren’s (2013a) discussion, we define four vectors γ̂ of descriptive statistics.
The first vector (“fractions in focal-point groups”) consists of the fraction of respondents who report
exactly 0, the fraction who report exactly 0.5, and the fraction who report exactly 1. The second
vector (“fractions in non-focal-point groups”) consists of the fractions of respondents whose reports
are in each of the intervals (0.1, 0.2], (0.2, 0.3], (0.3, 0.4], (0.4, 0.5), (0.5, 0.6], (0.6, 0.7], (0.7, 0.8],
(0.8, 0.9], and (0.9, 1). The third vector (“fraction in each group needing LTC”) consists of the
fraction of respondents giving each of the preceding reports who eventually need long-term care.
The fourth vector γ̂ consists of all three of the other vectors.
Hendren’s (2013a) discussion suggests that the third vector will be especially informative for
the minimum pooled price ratio.
Table III reports the estimated informativeness of each vector of descriptive statistics. The
estimated informativeness of the combined vector is 0.70. The estimated informativeness is 0.01
with respect to the fractions in focal point groups, 0.02 with respect to the fractions in non-focal27

point groups, and 0.68 with respect to the fraction in each group needing LTC. When γ̂ consists
only of the fraction in each group needing LTC, restricting from F N (·) to F RN (·) reduces the
√
worst-case bias in ĉ by an estimated factor of 1 − 1 − 0.68 ≈ 0.43. This finding seems consistent
with the author’s discussion.

Conclusions

Descriptive analysis has become an important complement to structural estimation. It is common
for a researcher to report descriptive statistics γ̂ that estimate features γ of the distribution of the
data that are in turn related to the quantity c of interest under the researcher’s model. A reader
who accepts the relationship between the features γ and the structural quantity c specified by the
researcher’s model, and who believes that the statistics γ̂ play an important role in “driving” the
structural estimate ĉ, may then be more confident in the researcher’s conclusions.
We propose one way to formalize this logic. We define a measure ∆ of the informativeness of
descriptive statistics γ̂ for a structural estimate ĉ. Informativeness captures the share of variation
in ĉ that is explained by γ̂ under their joint asymptotic distribution. We show that, under some
conditions, informativeness also governs the reduction in worst-case bias from accepting the relationship between γ and c specified by the researcher’s model. In this sense, descriptive analysis
based on statistics with high informativeness can indeed increase confidence in structural estimates.
Informativeness can be computed at negligible cost even for complex models, and we provide
a convenient recipe for computing it. We show in the context of our applications that reporting
informativeness can sharpen the interpretation of structural estimates in important economic settings. We recommend that researchers report estimated informativeness alongside their descriptive
analyses.

Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1 First consider F ∈ F N (c) . By the definition of F N (·) there exist
η ∈ Rp , ζ ∈ Rk such that F = F (η, ζ) and c = c (η) . Note, moreover, that since c (η) = L0 η while
EF [ĉ] = L0 η + C 0 ζ, EF [ĉ − c] = C 0 ζ. Thus, our task reduces to showing that

Note, however, that C 0 ζ = C 0 Ω 2 Ω− 2 ζ, so by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, |C 0 ζ| ≤ σc kζkΩ−1 .
Hence, to prove the result we need only show that any bias c̄ with |c̄| ≤ µσc can be achieved. To

as desired.
Next consider F ∈ F RN (c) . By the definition of F RN (·) there exist η ∈ Rp , ζ ∈ Rk such that
F = F (η, ζ), c = c (η) , and Γ0 (Xη + ζ) = Γ0 Xη. Thus, our task reduces to showing that

Proof of Proposition 2 Let us first consider the case with S ∈ S N (c? ) , with S N (c? ) nonempty.
By the definition of S N (c? ) and Lemma 1, for any S ∈ S N (c? ) there exist (h, z) ∈ H × Z with

S ∈ S RN (c? ) there exist (h, z) ∈ H × Z with S = S (h, z), c? (h) = c? , and
EF0 [φγ (Di ) (sh (Di ) + sz (Di ))] − EF0 [φγ (Di ) sh (Di )] = EF0 [φγ (Di ) sz (Di )] = 0.

Sensitivity and Informativeness

Proposition 2 considers the effect of limiting attention to forms of misspecification that do not
affect γ̂. In some cases, however, researchers may be interested in forms of misspecification with a
non-zero, but known, effect on γ̂. In such cases, our assumptions again imply a relationship between
the biases in ĉ and γ̂.
This relationship depends on the sensitivity of ĉ to γ̂. This is the natural extension of the
sensitivity measure proposed in Andrews et al. (2017) to the current setting.
Definition. The sensitivity of ĉ with respect to γ̂ is
Λ = Σcγ Σ−1
γγ .
To build intuition, note that sensitivity characterizes the relationship between ĉ and γ̂ in
the asymptotic distribution under the base model. If we assume, as in Section 3, that ĉ and
γ̂ are normally distributed in finite samples, then Λ is simply the vector of coefficients from the
population regression of ĉ on γ̂. In this case, element Λj of Λ is the effect of changing the realization
of a particular γ̂j on the expected value of ĉ, holding the other elements of γ̂ constant.
Andrews et al. (2017) show that for ĉ = c (η̂), η̂ a minimum distance estimator based on
moments ĝ (η), and γ̂ = ĝ (η0 ) the estimation moments evaluated at the true parameter value,
under regularity conditions sensitivity translates the effect of misspecification on γ̂ to the effect on
ĉ, in the sense that
c̄ (S (h, z)) − c̄ (S (h, 0)) = Λ (γ̄ (S (h, z)) − γ̄ (S (h, 0))) .
Our next proposition extends this result.

for any c? such that S RN (c? , γ̄) is nonempty.
Proposition 4 extends the results of Andrews et al. (2017) to the case where γ̂ need not be
a vector of estimation moments, and thus we may have ∆ < 1. It likewise extends Proposition 2.
The resulting set of first-order asymptotic biases for ĉ is centered at Λγ̄ with width proportional to

1 − ∆.
q Unlike in Proposition 2, the degree of misspecification now enters the width through

γγ γ̄,
 
which is the minimum necessary to allow γ̄ S̃ − γ̄ (S) = γ̄. If the degree of excess misspecification
is small then the first-order asymptotic bias of ĉ is close to Λγ̄, while if the degree of excess
misspecification is large then a wider range of biases is possible.
Proof of Proposition 4 The proof is similar to that for Proposition 2 in the main text. By
Lemma 1 we again have
c? (h) = EF0 [φc (Di ) sh (Di )] .
Note, next, that by the definition of S RN (c? , γ̄) and Lemma 1, for any S ∈ S RN (c? , γ̄) there exist
(h, z) ∈ H × Z with S = S (h, z), c? (h) = c? , and
EF0 [φγ (Di ) (sh (Di ) + sz (Di ))] − EF0 [φγ (Di ) sh (Di )] = EF0 [φγ (Di ) sz (Di )] = γ̄.
Thus, writing γ̄z = EF0 [φγ (Di ) sz (Di )] and c̄z = EF0 [φc (Di ) sz (Di )] for brevity, our task reduces

Non-Local Misspecification

This section develops our informativeness measure based on probability limits, rather than firstorder asymptotic bias.
Under Assumptions 1, 3, and 4, provided the estimators ĉ and γ̂ are regular in the sense
discussed in Newey (1994), Theorem 2.1 of Newey (1994) implies that the probability limits c̃ (·)
and γ (·) are asymptotically linear functionals, in the sense that
(18)

limtz →0 kc̃ (F0,z (0, tz )) − c (η0 ) − tz EF0 [sz (Di ) φc (Di )]k /tz = 0 for all z ∈ Z
limtz →0 kγ (F0,z (0, tz )) − γ (F0 ) − tz EF0 [sz (Di ) φγ (Di )]k /tz = 0 for all z ∈ Z.

Assumption 2 would be implied by an assumption that (ĉ, γ̂) are regular in the base model, so
the assumption of regularity of (ĉ, γ̂) in the nesting model can be understood as a strengthening
of Assumption 2. See Newey (1994) and Rieder (1994) for discussion. Since (18) only restricts
˜ (r̄) as defined in the main text let us instead
behavior as tz → 0 for fixed z, rather than studying ∆
consider an analogue defined
i collections of paths. Specifically, continuing to define
h  using finite
fh,z (Di ;th ,tz )
rh,z (th , tz ) = EFh,z (th ,0) ψ fh,z (Di ;th ,0) , for each z ∈ Z let
t̄ (z, µ) = inf {tz ∈ R+ : r0,z (0, tz ) ≥ µ}
denote the largest value of t such that r0,z (0, tz ) < µ for all tz < t̄ (z, µ) . Let Z+ ⊂ Z denote the

43

h
i
set of z ∈ Z with EF0 sz (Di )2 > 0.
Let Q ⊂ Z+ denote a finite subset of Z+ , and let Q denote the set of all such finite subsets.
Finally, let
b̃N (µ, Q) = sup {|c̃ (F0,z (0, tz )) − c (η0 )| : z ∈ Q, tz < t̄ (z, µ)}
denote the analogue of b̃N (µ) based on the finite set of paths Q, and for ε > 0 let
√
b̃RN,ε (µ, Q) = sup {|c̃ (F0,z (0, tz )) − c (η0 )| : z ∈ Q, tz < t̄ (z, µ) , kγ (F0,z (0, tz )) − γ (F0 )k ≤ ε µ}
denote the analogue of b̃RN (µ, Q) based on Q which allows the probability limit of γ̂ to change by
√
at most ε µ. Because b̃RN,0 (µ, Q) may equal 0 even for large µ due to the approximation error in
(18), we consider limits as ε ↓ 0 (i.e., as ε → 0 from above). Based on these objects, we define the
˜ (µ) as
analogue of ∆
˜ (µ, Q) = sup inf lim b̃RN,ε (µ, Q1 ) ,
∆
Q1 ∈Q Q2 ∈Q ε↓0 b̃N (µ, Q2 )
provided the limit exists.
Proposition 7. Suppose Assumptions 1, 3, and 4 hold, that the estimators ĉ and γ̂ are regular,
and that Assumption 6 holds for h = 0 and all z ∈ Z+ . For ψ (·) twice continuously differentiable
and ψ (1) = 0, ψ 00 (1) = 2,
sup inf lim lim

√

1 − ∆.

It is important that we take the limit as µ ↓ 0 inside the limit as ε ↓ 0 and the sup and inf,
since this order of limits allows us to take advantage of the approximation result (18).
Proof of Proposition 7 Note, first, that our Assumptions 1, 3, and 4 imply the conditions of
Theorem 2.1 of Newey (1994) other than regularity of (ĉ, γ̂). Specifically, conditions (i) and (ii) of
Theorem 2.1 in Newey (1994) follow from our Assumptions 3 and 4. Condition (iii) is implied by
our Assumption 1. Regularity of (ĉ, γ̂) is assumed, so Theorem 2.1 of Newey (1994) implies (18).
Note, next, that for any z ∈ Z+ , the proof of Proposition 5 implies that

Accounting for Richer Dependence of ĉ on the Data

In Section 5, for cases where the function c (θ) depends on the distribution of the data other than
through θ, we effectively fix the distribution of the data at the empirical distribution for the purposes
22

If the denominator on the right hand side is zero, we define the limit as +∞.

46

of estimating ∆ and Λ. Here we discuss how to allow for uncertainty about the distribution of data
in a special case, and present corresponding calculations for our applications.
Suppose in particular that
(19)

ĉ =


1X 
c θ̂; Di
n
i

for some function c (·). In contrast to the setup in Section 5, here we allow that ĉ depends on the
data directly, and not only through the dependence of ĉ on θ̂.
In this case, one can show that the recipe in Section 5 applies, with the modification that
(20)





φ̂c (Di ) = c θ̂; Di + Λ̂cg φg Di ; θ̂



where φg Di ; θ̂ and Λ̂cg are as defined in Section 5, and Ĉ in the definition of Λ̂cg is now given
P
by the gradient of n1 i c (θ; Di ) with respect to θ at θ̂.
The proof of this result, which we omit, proceeds by noting that we can augment the GMM parameter vector as (c, θ), and correspondingly augment the moment equation as (c (θ; Di ) − c, φg (Di ; θ)),
following which we can derive the estimated influence function for ĉ as we would for any element
of θ̂.
In the cases of Attanasio et al. (2012a) and Gentzkow (2007a), we can represent the calculation
ˆ using the modified estimated influence function
of ĉ in the form given in (19) and thus calculate ∆
in (20). In the case of Attanasio et al. (2012a), the estimates in Table I change from 0.283, 0.227,
and 0.056, respectively, to 0.277, 0.221, and 0.055. In the case of Gentzkow (2007a), the estimates
in Table II change from 0.514, 0.009, and 0.503, respectively, to 0.517, 0.008, and 0.507.
