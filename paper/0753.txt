Inflation, Tax Rules and the Accumulation of
Residential and Nonresidential Capital

ABSTRACT

The present paper analyses the effect of the interaction between

tax rules and inflation on the size and allocation of the capital stock

with particular emphasis on the role of owner—occupied housing. The analysis
is developed in the framework of an economy that is in equilibrium and

in which a constant fraction of disposable income is saved. In this model,
I show that, with current U.S. tax laws, an increase inthe rate of inflation reduces the equilibrium amount of business capital employed in

the economy and raises the amount of housing capital. The analysis also
shows that a higher rate of inflation lowers the real net—of—tax rate

of return to the provider of business capital. In a richer model than
the current one, i.e., in a model in which the rate of personal saving

was an increasing function of the net rate of return, a higher inflation
rate would therefore lower the rate of saving.
The present analysis also shows that permitting firms to depreciate
investments more rapidly for tax purposes increases the accumulations of

business capital but that, unless firms are permitted to expense all investment immediately, an increase in inflation continues to depress the
accumulation of business capital.

among the prevailing economists of that decade. In effect, these economists and
the politicians agreed on the treatment of the econonr even though they
disagreed about the proper diagnosis of its economic condition. First, there

were those who continued to believe in a long—run Phillips curve trade—off be-

tween inflation and unemployment. They advocated expansionary

policy in the

hope of reducing unemployment permanently even if that meant accepting a higher

inflation rate. Second, there were those who recognized that no long—run tradeunemployment rate had

off exists but who misjudged how high the noninflationary

become because of changes in the demographic structure of the labor force and in
the transfer programs that encouraged higher unemployment.

They advocated

expansionary monetary and fiscal policies because they believed that the econorrvi
was

still operating with "too much unemployment." Finally, there were those who

correctly perceived that the econonvr was at or below the
unemployment

rate but who

resisted a tightening of

noninflationary

monetary

and fiscal policy

because they were unwilling to pay the price in higher unemployment for slowing
the rise in inflation or reducing its level.

In this way

the

econorrr drifted to higher and higher rates of

inflation.1 Although some of the year to year changes in inflation were
unexpected, the general level and even some of the upward drift clearly

came to be anticipated. For more than a decade now, a major debate among
American macroeconomists has been about whether such anticipated inflation has

any effects on the real econonr. At least since Milton Friedman's

(1968) presi-

dential address, economists have recognized that expected inflation is perfectly
neutral in a simplified econoimj with flexible prices, inelastic money demand and

no

taxes. Subsequent research by Barro (l97), Lucas

(1972), Sargent and

Wallace (1975) and others has refined this idea and emphasized the corresponding
neutrality of expected changes in the stock of money.1
The important question, however, is whether the neutrality of anticipated changes in money and in the price level are relevant to the actual econoIrr

in which we live. James Tobin (1965) emphasized that even fully anticipated
inflation is not neutral because the demand for money balances varies inversely
with the nominal interest rate and therefore with the expected rate of

inflation. An increase in inflation caused by a more rapid growth of money
would therefore raise the capital intensity of the economy by inducing house-

holds to substitute real capital for money in their portfolios. Stanley Fischer
(1979) has recently examined the lead and lag patterns by which expected changes
in the money stock can alter the capital stock and real output through the Tobin

money—capital substitution effect. Although this portfolio substitution process
is analytically correct, it is generally agreed that the magnitude of the Tobin
effect is extremely small.2
By contrast, the interaction of inflation and the tax rulcs can have
very substantial effects on the incentive to save and on the relative returns to

different types of investments. In Feidstein (1916) I examined the way in which
the tax—inflation interaction could lower total capital formation by reducing

the incentive to save. Then in Feldstein (1980a) I showed how the tax—inflation
interaction would encourage individual investors to substitute interest bearing
government debt for real capital in their portfolios and thereby reduce the real

capital intensity of the econorrw. The present paper extends this analysis to
examine how inflation diverts capital from plant and equipment to owner—occupied
housing.

Under present U.S. tax law,2 an individual who owns his own house way
deduct the interest payment in calculating taxable income and does not pay tax
on

the implicit rental income provided (in kind) by his

house. In addition, the

capital gains on owner—occupied housing are virtually untaxed. Because nominal
interest payments are deductible, the tax advantages of investment in owner—

occupied housing rise substantially with inflation. If, for example, the
mortgage interest rate is 4 percent in the absence of inflation, an individual

with a rginal tax rate of 40 percent pays a 2.4 percent real net rate of
interest. If an expected inflation rate of 8 percent raises the interest
rate to 12 percent, the real net interest rate falls to minus 0.8 percent. The

I have previously discussed the way that inflation and tax rules combine to
achieve this distortion in Feidstein (198Gb, 1980d) but have not previously
presented a formal model. For other analyses of the way that the tax—
inflation interaction affects the demand for residential capital, see

value of the tax deduction of nominal interest rates rises from 1.6 percent to .8
percent.

In contrast, the tax burden on business capital rises when there is

inflation. Under existing U.S. tax rules, inflation affects the taxation of
business capital in three important ways.

First,

because of the "historic cost"

approach to calculating the cost of production, a higher rate of inflation
reduces the real value of depreciation allowances and understates the costs of

replacing the goods withdrawn from inventory. Second, the owners of the equity
of business firms pay capital gains tax on the rise in the nominal value of the

capital stock. And, third, the firm gets to deduct nominal interest payments
(thereby understating its taxable profits) but the creditors iast pay tax on

nominal interest receipts (thereby overstating their taxable income). Since the
effective tax rate on the reduced corporate income is very close to the effective tax rate on the increased creditor income (Feldstein and Summers, 1980),

this third effect is very small. On balance, inflation therefore raises the
tax burden on the income from business investment.
Since the stock of housing capital is about i4 percent of the stock of
nonresidential capital1- an incentive to shift capital from plant and equipment
to housing can have a significant effect on the amount of plant and equipment in

the econony. The ratio of net investment in residential capital to net invest—

presented

econometric evidence that the interaction of tax rules and inflation reduced the
incentive to invest in plant and equipment and that this can explain most of the
variation in the share of GNP devoted to such investment during the past three
decades.

The present paper analyses the effect of the interaction between tax
rules and inflation on the size and allocation of the capital stock with par-

ticular emphasis on the role of owner—occupied housing. The analysis is developed in the framework of an economy that is in equilibrium and in which a

constant fraction of disposable income is saved. In this model, I show that,
with current U.S. tax laws, an increase in the rate of inflation reduces the
equilibrium amount of business capital employed in the econoirr and raises the

amount of housing capital. The analysis also shows that a higher rate of inflation lowers the real net—of—tax rate of return to the provider of business capi-

tal. In a richer model than the current one, i.e., in a model in which the rate
of personal saving was an increasing function of the net rate of return, a
higher inflation rate would therefore lower the rate of saving.
The present analysis also shows that permitting firms to depreciate
investments more rapidly for tax purposes increases the accumulations of business capital but that, unless firms are permitted to expense all investment
immediately, an increase in inflation continues to depress the accumulation of
business capital.

The model considered in this paper is a very simple one. To keep the
analysis tractable and informative, I ignore several issues that I have considered

in

earlier papers: changes in the saving rate; changes in the demand

for money; government debt; and the mixture of debt and equity in corporate

finance.1 A model

1. A GrowjnEconom with Inflation and Housin
The simplest framework within which to examine the effect of inflation

on the composition of the capital stock is an economy with two sectors. The
corporate business sector produces a general good that can be used for both consumption and investment. The unincorporated household sector produces the services of the owner—occupied housing stock. The population grows exogenously in
this economy at a constant rate (n) and the labor force is a fixed fraction of

the population. Labor is employed only in the production of the general good;
housing services are proportional to the stock of housing and are produced

without labor.2

See

Feldstein (1976, 1980)

and

Feldstein, Green and Sheshinski (1978).

2 The model also ignores the land used in housing. In the current framework,
inflation would raise the relative price of land.

—8—

The Business Sector
If the general good is produced with constant returns to scale, the

techno1or can be described by a production function that relates output per
employee (y) to the capital stock per employee used in this sector (k):

y =

(1.1)

f(k).

For simplicity, output is measured net of depreciation and all technical
progress is ignored.

The pretax rate of return on corporate capital is f'. In the absence
of inflation, corporations pay tax at rate t on this return to capital. The net
of tax returns on the marginal investment, (l—i)f', mast in equilibrium be equal

to the firms' net cost of funds. The analysis is greatly simplified by assuming
that all marginal investments are financed by debt.1 On these funds, firms pay
interest rate i. Since interest expenses are deducted in calculating a firrnts
taxable income, the net cost of borrowed funds is (l—r)i and the firm's
equilibrium condition is (l—'r)f'

It

(l—T)i or just f' =

i.

is worth noting that the analysis of this paper could be done

equally easily for an economy without any debt finance. In such an economy,
firms would use only equity finance and homeowners would have no mortgages. The
same basic results about the allocation of capital would be obtained, indicating
that the fundamental issue is the inflation—induced rise in the relative taxation of
business income and not the deductibility of nominal interest payments on
mortgages.
1

The rationale for all "debt at the margin" finance is developed in Stiglitz
(1913 ) and a model of growth equilibrium with such finance is presented in
Feldstein (1916). More realistically, the costs of debt and equity funds
on a firm's debt—equity ratios see Gordon and Malkiel (1981)

fact,

the tax accounting rules that have prevailed in the United States, infla-

tion causes taxable profits to increase relative to real profits. Both historic
cost depreciation and the use of first—in—first—out inventory accounting cause
an understatement of the true cost of production and therefore an overstatement

of taxable profits.1 As an approximation, the increase in taxable income per
unit of capital can be written as a constant rrultiple of the inflation rate, Air,

The additional tax is thus iXir. The nominal rate of

return to the corportion net of tax is therefore (l—r)f' + it — itAit.

Since

the nominal interest rate is deducted in calculating taxable

income, the net of tax cost of borrowed funds is (l—T)i. The equilibrium condition that requires equating the nominal net returns on the marginal unit of
capital to the net cost of funds therefore implies

If depreciation schedules permit tax depreciation that is faster than economic depreciation, taxable profits in the absence of inflation will be less
than true profits. The increase in real taxable profits caused by inflation may leave taxable profits greater or less than true profits. What matters is the change in the size of this difference, i.e., profits relative to
real profits, and not the sign of the difference.
2

See Auerbach (1979) for an explicit derivation of the relation between it, ft
n, the true rate of depreciation and the increase in taxable income caused
by historic cost depreciation. Feldstein (1980c) discusses the additional
contribution of FIFO inventory accounting. For the United States, a value
of A = 0.50 is a reasonable approximation with the tax laws in effect in
the late 1970's.

contrast to the traditional conclusion of Irving Fisher that the nominal

interest rate rises point for point with the rate of inflation, equation 1.3

shows that, for a fixed real marginal product of capital, the rise in the
interest rate reflects the tax deductibility of nominal interest and the

mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits. With economic depreciation and no artificial inventory profits, A = 0 and di/dir = 11(1—i).

The impact of inflation on the real net return to lenders depends on two things.
First, t—0 reflects the difference between the advantage of deducting nominal

nominal

The Housing Sector
The owner—occupied housing sector uses capital but no labor to produce

housing services. Since in the long—run capital can irove freely between the two
sectors,

the equilibrium price of a unit of housing capital is the same as the

price of a unit of business capital which in turn is the price of a unit of
general goodJ The price of housing services therefore depends on the cost

This assumes that individuals borrow and lend at the same interest rate. It
also reflects the U.S. tax rule that permits individuals to deduct mortgage
interest payments in the calculation of taxable income.

folio asset. Since I have assumed that the amount of housing service is propor—
tiorial to the housing stock, it is not necessary to distinguish the demand for

services from the demand for a portfolio asset. Instead, the demand for housing

capital can be

considered

directly with its determinants reflecting both the

portfolio and service characteristics. The simplest such specification is

h =

where Ii is the housing capital stock per employee and '<

o.-

In terms of the demand for housing services, equation i.6 implies that

the relative demand for housing services and for other goods varies inversely

with the implicit rental price of housing. A more general specification would
make the demand for housing a function of real income and of wealth. Within the
current paper, however, the equilibrium values of real income and wealth remain

constant except for changes in the efficiency of resource allocation. If the

condition of the econonr is regarded as one of optimal resource allocation, the changes in resource allocation that result from a small increase in

Shifting one unit of capital from the business sector to housing reduces
real income by the difference between the real marginal products of capital
in

the two sections and this income effect reduces the demand for housing
capital by the marginal propensity to own housing capital as a function of
real income, The real marginal product difference is less than f' which is
approximately 0.12 in the United States. The marginal housing—to—income
ratio is less than three. Thus this real income effect offsets at most
about one—third of any shift of capital from the business to housing
sectors.
2

3

This is particularly true when the acquisition of housing capital is
financed by borrowing.

The model assumes that all housing is owner—occupied when in reality about 15
percent of the housing capital stock is owner occupied. The tax advantages
and other aspects of home ownership outweigh risk considerations at most
income levels. The •tax advantge of home ownership is increased by inflation
since rental property is adversely affected by historic cost depreciation
rules.
I believe that the risks associated with increased investment in housing
capital kept the price of houses from rising even faster in the 1910's. For
many individuals with high marginal tax rates, the implicit rental cost of
housing was then zero or negative.

-litThe Demand for Money
Money plays two quite distinct roles in a model of equilibrium

growth. First, the exogenously given rate of growth of the nominal money
stock determines the rate of inflation. This follows directly from the fact
that the stock of real money balances per employee imist remain constant in

equilibrium growth since real income per employee, real assets per employee and

the rate of interest are all constant.1 If real money balances per employee
are to remain constant, the rate of growth of the nominal money stock (M/M) must
equal the rate of growth of prices plus the rate of' growth of the labor force:

that an increase in inflation, by increasing the real cost

of holding money balances, encourages households to economize on real money
balances and therefore to devote a larger share of their wealth to real capital

formation. The importance of this substitution effect depends on the size of
the stock of "outside money" (i.e., money that does not represent a liability of
any private entity) relative to total wealth and on the elasticity of money

demand with respect to the nominal rate of interest. The monetary base, a
reasonable measure of the stock of outside money,2 was only $160 billion in 1980

Public and Private Consumption
The

government consumes a fraction (i) of real national income and

households consume a fraction (1—o) of real disposable income. National income

consists of the output of the business

sector plus the output of the owner—

occupied housing sectorJ To combine these two products, I assurie a constant
relative price of housing services, i.e., an implicit rental of p per unit of

capital; national income per employee is thus y + ph.

Real govern-

ment spending per employee is

;=y(y+ph).

This ignores the value of the services of the stock of money, an omission
that has no qualitative effect on the results

of this analysis.

2

The value of p is the initial rental price of housing services. A small
change in the rental price changes real income to the extent that (1) it
reallocates capital between h and k and (b) the marginal product of business
capital differs from p. That is, the change in real income is f'dk + pdh.
It would be incorrect to include a term of the form Mr in evaluating the
change in real income since dr represents either a change in the implicit
price that individuals pay themselves on housing or a change in the ax consequences of home ownership that would macrely be offset by a change in other
taxes.

—16—

Disposable income may be defined as national income minus both taxes
paid (t) and the loss in real money balances caused by inflation (Jim).1 Thus
consumption per employee is
c = (i—a) (y + ph —

Since the government deficit equals the increase in the stock of money balances
(g—t = (Ir+n)rn), equation 1.10 can be rewritten:

This formulation, which is essentially due to Tobin (1965), assumes that households regard their increase in real balances as a component of disposable income
even though the real resources available to households (i.e., the maximum
feasible consumption) are only y + ph —

1 Taxes include the taxes on capital income from corporations and industries
and an additional nondistorting tax. Changes in tax revenue that result from
changes in inflation are offset by changes in the nondistorting tax to keep
total tax revenue unchanged. If the offsetting change in other sources of
tax revenue were in a distortionary tax, the effect of inflation on real
income would be more couplex than the current analysis indicates. See
Feldstein (1916) for a discussion of this issue.

results.

Disequilibrium Adjustments
The next section uses equations 1.11 and i.i8

to

examine the

equilibrium effects of changes in the rate of inflation and the tax rules.

The complex expressions that result are readily interpreted in terms of the

disequilibrium adjustments of the capital stock. This permits determining the

of equilibrium change without having to specify numerical values for

directions

individual parameters.
Two very plausible disequilibrium adjustment assumptions will be made.
First,

the Net Adjustment Assumption: an increase in either type of capital

stock per employee above its equilibrium value causes total wealth per employee

to

decline:

d(k +

and

(1.10)

d(k +

Equation 1,19 is satisfied if, when k exceeds its equilibrium value, k falls and

the other types of wealth (housing plus real money balances) do not increase by

an even greater amount. Second, the Partial Adjustment Assumption:

when the

stok of business capital per employee exceeds its equilibrium value, the total
wealth per employee will decline even if housing

constant:

wealth

per employee is held

—19--

(1.21)
Since

a (k + h + m)

<

0

the fall in k (i.e., k<0) is likely to raise the housing stock, holding

housing constant should make it easier to satisfy the condition that a positive

pertubation of k causes total wealth to decline. In this sense, 1.21 is a
weaker assumption than 1.19 and 1.20.

2. Effects of Changes in Inflation
We are now in a position to examine the effect of inflation on the
capital intensity of the business sector, on the consumption of housing services, and on the real net return to savers. Before beginning the forrnaj. deri-

vation of these effects, it is useful to consider the general logic of the process.
A higher rate of inflation reduces the after tax profitability of
investment because the tax accounting procedures for dealing with depreciation

and inventories raise the effective tax rate. This lower after—tax profitability
means that firms can pay only a lower real net rate of return to the creditors
who supply their capital.
The net return to the suppliers of business capital is also affected

by the fact that firms deduct nominal interest payments and that lenders pay tax

on nominal interest receipts. This matters, however, only to the extent that
the tax rates of borrowers and lenders are different.

balance, inflation lowers the real net rate of return and therefore
reduces the implicit rental cost of housing. This in turn raises the consumption of housing services relative to the output of other goods. The present
On

section

will now show explicitly that this

reduces the equilibrium amount of

—20—

business capital per employee and therefore the productivity of the labor force.

The decrease in productivity and the reallocation of production to housing also

lowers the real income per capita. Although the analysis takes the saving rate
(a) as fixed, the reduction in the real net rate of return implies that the
saving rate in a more general model would probably also be reduced, thereby
further decreasing the capital intensity of production.
The equilibrium growth condition of equation 1.17 can be rewritten by
collecting terms as:

[anll —

a(1—y)f +

(2.1)

Using equation 1.18 for

and totally differentiating 2.1 with respect to k and

The effect of inflation on equilibrium capital intensity can now be written:

The final effect of inflation that I wish to examine is on total real

this is

an implication of the common proposition that any small

taxes and inflation make

the

initial condition suboptimal, the rea11ocaiori of

capital caused by an increase in inflation will have a first order effect on

real income. More specifically, the very favorable tax treatment of owner—
occupied housing implies that even in the absence of inflation the real return
to marginal housing capital (p) is less than the return to business capital

(f'). A positive inflation rate widens the gap. This implies that a reallocation of capital from the business sector causes a loss of real income. More
formally the change in real income induced by an inflation—induced change in the
allocation of capital is

Indexing the Tax Rules
Inflation causes a misallocation of capital between the business and

housing sectors because the tax laws mismeasure capital income and expenses.

A

complete indexing of the tax laws would eliminate this source of the distortion
caused by

inflation.

Complete indexing has three aspects:

(1) eliminating the

mismeasurement of depreciation and inventory profits that causes business
operating profits to be overstated; (2) limiting the deductions for business
interest to real interest payments only; and (3) limiting the taxation of house-

hold interest income and expenses to the real interest rate. This section shows
the neutrality of inflation when all three of the features are present and
examines

the non—neutrality when there is only partial indexing.1

If firms pay tax rate 11

operating profits net of real interest

but deduct the inflation component against their tax liability at rate

the firms' equilibrium condition (analogous to equation 1.2) is

If

households are taxed on real interest receipts at rate O and on the

inflation component of interest payments at rate 02, the real net rate of
interest is j_01(i_1T)—021t_1t

Since

the irtiplicit rental

cost of housing is the real net rate of interest plus the "other costs per unit

rental cost that has already been analyzed. With complete

(02=r2=A=O), equation 3.3 reduces to

r = (i—01)f' + z

(3.14)

Here the implicit rental price is independent of inflation.It is sometimes proposed that the elimination of historic cost depreciation be coupled with limiting the business interest deduction to the real
cost of funds. In terms of equation 3.3, this implies X=T20 but 01= 02. The
resulting implicit rental cost of housing is then:

An increase in inflation reduces the implicit rental cost because the firm is

denied a deduction for the inflation premium in

the interest rate

but the house-

hold pays tax on that premium. An increase in the rate of inflation thus reduces the.real net return to households on business capital and thereby lowers the
cost

The allocation of capital still favors housing because the net services of
housing are not taxed while interest income is taxable and the mortgage

approach that focuses only on the firm may exacerbate the bias in favor of
housing that is caused by inflation and clearly does not leave an inflation—
neutral allocation of capital.

Most countries have dealt with inflation by accelerating the rate of
depreciation used for calculating taxable profits but without changing the tax

treatment of interest income and expenses. Accelerating depreciation has two
distinct effects. First, at any rate of inflation (including zero), this
lowers the effective tax rate on operating profits. In the notation of
equation 3.1, it is equivalent to increasing f'; note that it is not equivalent

since

to lowering T1

The decrease in

raises the implicit rental cost of housing since it

reduces the excess tax on business capital caused by historic cost accounting

methods. Similarly the rise in f' raises the return on business investment
and thus directly increases the implicit rental cost of owner occupied housing.

Although full indexing avoids all of the tax induced distortions associated with
inflation, the right acceleration of depreciation can achieve the same effect
for any

given rate of inflation.

Conclusion

It
in

is ironic

that an easy money policy aimed at stimulating investment

plant and equipment is likely to have just the opposite effect: reducing the

—27—

long—run capital intensity of production. Whatever the short—run virtue of
expansionary policies, the long—run consequence of inflation under existing U.S.

tax laws is to reduce investors' demand for business capital and to increase it
for owner—occupied housing.

The simple model developed in this paper shows more generally how the

expectation

of further inflation of the sort that resulted from the inflationary

experience of the

1960's

and 1910's can have very

substantial

effects on the

real economy. The notion •that a fully—anticipated monetary expansion or infla-

tion has no effect on the real econorr is not plausible in a modern econonr with

a complex set of tax rules. The specific effect of inflation will, moreover,
vary

from country to country and from time to time as a function of the par-

ticular features of the country's fiscal structure.

It would be useful to extend the current analysis in a variety of

ways. Of particular interest would be replacing the debt—only assumption of
corporate finance with a mixture of debt and equity. This would bring out the
more limited significance of the corporate deductibility of nominal interest
payments and would show the relevance of the taxation of nominal capital gains.

A further (or alternative) extension to include interest bearing government debt
as well as money would be of interest because this would permit the government
to vary the real interest rate through its debt management policy and would show
the effect of inflation on residential investment when low—risk government debt

is an alternative asset. Finally, since the analysis here is limited to U.S.
tax rules, it would be quite interesting to see it altered to describe the tax
rules of other countries and used to analyze the effect of inflation in these
settings.
