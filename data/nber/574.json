It is found that symmetry in this context is essentially equivalent to the proposition that the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function displays either constant absolute or constant relative risk aversion, depending upon whether the substitution matrix is defined in terms of arithmetic or geometric rates of return.\n\n",
