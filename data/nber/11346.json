With time, however, neither has survived as part of U.S. monetary policymaking.\n\tWhat remains is the question of whether 1979 brought a new, greater weight on the Federal Reserve's objective of price stability vis-a-vis its objective of output growth and high employment (1).  That is certainly one interpretation of the historical record.  But the historical evidence is also consistent with the view that the 1970s were exceptional, rather than that the experience since 1979 has differed from what went before as a whole.\n\n",
