A method based on traveling costs is used to value library use at each branch. The relationship between library operations and library use is estimated using a two-stage technique. The costs of library operations are explored. Marginal benefit-cost ratios are presented. The study finds that the New York Public Library operates too many branches for too few hours of service.\n\n",
