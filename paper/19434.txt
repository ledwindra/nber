The Impact of Mothers’ Earnings on Health Inputs and Infant Health

September 2013
JEL No. I10,I12,J31
ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the impact of mothers’ earnings on birth weight and gestational age of
infants. It also analyzes the impact of earnings on mothers’ consumption of prenatal medical care,
and their propensity to smoke and drink during pregnancy. The paper uses census-division- and
year-specific skill-biased technology shocks as an instrument for mothers’ earnings and employs
a two-sample instrumental variables strategy. About 14 million records of births between 1989
and 2004 are used from the Natality Detail files along with the CPS Annual Demographic Files
from the same period. The results reveal that an increase in weekly earnings prompts an increase
in prenatal care of low-skill mothers (those who have at most a high school degree) who are not
likely to be on Medicaid, and that earnings have a small positive impact on birth weight and
gestational age of the newborns of these mothers. An increase in earnings does not influence the
health of newborns of high-skill mothers (those with at least some college education). Variations
in earnings have no impact on birth weight for mothers who are likely to be on Medicaid.

The Impact of Mothers’ Earnings on Health Inputs and Infant Health

I. Introduction
Child health is an important ingredient in human capital formation and poor health at
birth impacts adult outcomes. For example, low birth weight reduces educational attainment
(Case et al 2005; Currie and Hyson 1999). Low birth weight also has a negative impact on labor
market outcomes (Black et al 2007; Currie and Hyson 1999) and on health in adulthood
(Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004).
The seminal work of Grossman (1972) provides the theoretical framework of a human
capital model through which the production of health can be analyzed. In this model individuals’
health capital depreciates over time and gross investment in health can be produced by a
household production function that uses the person’s own time, and health inputs such as
medical care and healthy diet. Health inputs may include those with negative marginal products
such as cigarette and alcohol consumption.1 The initial health endowment is an important
determinant of the future stock of health. This endowment is not only determined by genetics,
but it can be impacted by in utero exposure to disease, and detrimental environmental factors
such as air pollution (Almond 2006; Currie and Walker 2011).
In this context it is important to investigate, both from a scientific and public policy
perspective, the extent to which an increase in maternal income during pregnancy impacts infant
health. The issue, however, is complicated because of the endogeneity of income. For example,
in the analysis of the impact of mothers’ income on birth outcomes, it is difficult to find

As described in Almond and Currie (2011), different approaches to health production exist; e.g.
Heckman (2007)

exogenous variations in income that could help identify the causal impact of income on birth
weight. Consequently, one line of research has focused on aggregate units such as the rate of
low birth weight infants at the state level, and analyzed how this aggregate is impacted by state
unemployment rates. For example, Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) found that higher
unemployment rates were associated with improved health outcomes of infants as measured by
the rate of low birth weight. This result is consistent with the findings of Ruhm (2000), who
reported that health behaviors improved during bad economic times, leading to better health
outcomes.2
Birth weight is a key birth outcome, and there are two channels through which pregnant
women’s earnings may affect birth weight of their newborn. First, if child health is a normal
good, then an increase in income increases the derived demand for health inputs. For example,
pregnant women may increase the consumption of prenatal care, and they may initiate prenatal
medical care earlier during the pregnancy. In this case, increases in prenatal care consumption
will lead to increases in birth weight. On the other hand, prenatal care is a time intensive activity
and an increase in the opportunity cost of time may result in mothers seeking less prenatal care.
Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) show that the average number of prenatal care visits by
pregnant women increases during times of high unemployment and they argue that the decline in
the opportunity cost of time during recessions (when incomes go down) is the underlying reason
for this decline. They report that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate
results in a 0.26-0.5% reduction in the low birth weight rate, and they attribute the improvement
of birth outcomes to the implied increase of prenatal care consumption during recessions.
However, as pointed out by Lindo (2011), Dehejia and Lleras-Muney (2004) are not able to
Although Ruhm (2013) points out the sensitivity of the findings regarding countercylicality of good
health outcomes

isolate the impact of income on infant health from the impact of other factors that are associated
with periods of high unemployment.
Almond, Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2011) explained the county-level average birth
weight as a function of the introduction of the Food Stamp Program (FSP) in the 1960s.
Exploiting the fact that the FSP became operational in different counties in different time
periods, they find that FSP had a positive impact on birth weight, with larger impacts among
African American mothers. Although food stamps can be used only to purchase certain food
items, Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2009) report that the food stamp recipients behave as if the
benefits were paid in cash, suggesting that the receipt of food stamps is equivalent to an income
transfer. On the other hand, Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2012) find that the food stamp program
leads to reductions in employment and hours worked, especially among families headed by
single women. They show that the impact on the treated is 500-600 fewer hours of work per
year. This suggests that the increase in disposable income due to the food stamp receipt is
counterbalanced to some extent by a decline in labor supply triggered by the food stamp
program, and therefore the net effect on household income may be not substantial.
Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2012) use changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
policy to identify exogenous changes in income. They use birth certificate data collapsed into
cells defined by state, month, parity of birth, education, marital status, race, and age of the
mother to identify the amount of EITC for which the family is eligible. Using a difference in
difference specification to capture the effect of an expansion of the EITC in 1993, the authors
conclude that increases in EITC income resulted in a lower incidence of low birth weight as well
as an increase in mean birth weight.

An alternative strategy to investigate the impact of income on infant health involves
using micro data, and finding arguably exogenous variations in income. One such example is
Lindo (2011) where the job loss of a husband in the past is used as an exogenous shock to
household income. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and controlling for
individual fixed effects, the paper found that a husband’s job loss in the past has a strong
negative effect on infant health, reducing birth weight by about 4.5 percent. Although this is an
interesting result, the magnitude of the decline in income due to job loss is unknown, so is the
extent to which job loss is correlated with stress in the household, which can also have a
detrimental effect on birth outcomes. Along the same lines, Chung and Kim (2012) used payouts
of dividends from the Alaska Permanent Fund during the 1980s as a source of exogenous
variation in family income and found a very small positive effect of family income on birth
weight. The magnitude of the estimated effect was only about 14 grams of additional birth
weight per one thousand dollars of additional income.
In this paper we employ data from the United States Detail Natality files for the period of
1989 to 2004 and use information on about 14 million births to unmarried mothers to estimate
the causal impact of mothers’ earnings at the time of conception on the birth weight of the
newborns using an instrumental-variables strategy.3 We focus on unmarried mothers because,
as explained below, our instrument is conceptually less relevant for married women. Because
earnings of pregnant women may be correlated with their unobserved attributes that may also
impact birth outcomes, we use a well-defined measure of skill-biased technology as an
instrument for earnings. Because earnings information is not available on birth certificates, we
use micro data from the CPS for the same time period to estimate first-stage earnings equations.
We use birth certificates for births that occurred between 1989 and 2004. Depending on the birth month, this
means that conception will have occurred between 1988 and 2004. See Section 3 for details.

The reduced form equations are based on birth certificates where birth weight of the newborn
depends on exogenous mother characteristics and the skill-biased technology parameter
determined at the census division level by year. This two-sample instrumental variables design
enables us to recover the structural estimate of the impact of mothers’ earnings on birth weight
and gestational age of their newborn.
In addition, we estimate input demand functions for smoking, drinking, and consumption
of prenatal medical care using data provided by birth certificates. Together, these results reveal
insights into not only the impact of income on birth weight, but also on the pathways through
which the impact of income operates. For example, we find that in case of low-skilled pregnant
women (those with education levels of high school or less) who are unlikely to be covered by
Medicaid, the increase in income produces an increase in prenatal care consumption, which
results in an improvement in birth weight and gestational age. A different result is obtained for
high-skilled pregnant women. The demand for prenatal care is not sensitive to income for highskilled women, and the effect of income on birth weight in the sample of high-skill women is
zero.
The rest of the paper is as follows. In the next section we describe the empirical
framework and introduce the instrument. Section III describes the data, and Section IV presents
the results. Section V consists of the conclusion and discussion.

II. Theoretical Framework and Empirical Strategy
Following the standard framework of a birth weight production function as outlined in
Grossman and Joyce (1990), Corman, Joyce and Grossman (1987), and Corman and Grossman
(1985), we assume that parents’ utility function depends on consumption, the number of births,
and the birth outcome. Maximization of this function subject to production and budget
5

constraints generates the demand for birth outcome; and the production function of birth
outcome determines the demand for inputs such as medical care. The birth weight production
function can be depicted as
𝑏 = 𝑓(𝑚, 𝑎, 𝑧)

(1)

where 𝑚 is the use of prenatal care, 𝑎 is the use of contraceptive and abortion services, and 𝑧
represents maternal risk factors and productive efficiency of the mother (Altindag et al 2011;
Grossman 2000, 2006). Input demand functions obtained in this framework are given by
Equations (2) and (3)
𝑚 = 𝑔1 (𝑝, 𝑦, 𝑧)

(2)

𝑎 = 𝑔2 (𝑝, 𝑦, 𝑧)

(3)

where 𝑝 is the vector of prices and availability and y represents income. Substitution of (2) and
(3) into (1) yields
𝑏 = ℎ(𝑝, 𝑦, 𝑧)

(4)

Equation (4) is the reduced form demand function for the birth outcome, where birth outcome b
depends on prices, income and maternal risk factors. We estimate (4) to identify the impact of
income on infant health at the mother level. We also estimate (2) to identify the role played by
income in inputs demand functions. The input demand functions are also reduced form equations
because they are obtained by maximizing a utility function subject to production and resource
constraints (Corman and Grossman 1985).
Although (4) is a reduced form, its estimation is complicated using micro data (birth
certificates) for two reasons. First, the birth certificate data do not contain information on
mother’s income (𝑦). Second, even if income information were available on birth certificates,
6

mother’s income (or family income) in equation (4) is endogenous if more productive mothers
with higher incomes have better health outcomes due to unobservable productivity. Therefore we
develop an instrument for y to employ in equations (4) and (2). The details of the instrument are
described below.
Since a data set that includes both income and indicators of infant health are not
available, we employ data from two different sources and use a two-sample instrumental
variables strategy. We use income data for women of child bearing age from the Current
Population Survey (CPS) for the years 1989-2005, covering earnings for the years 1988-2004 to
estimate the following first stage regression.

(5)

𝑡
𝑡
represents real weekly earnings of woman (𝑖) in state (𝑠) in year (𝑡), and 𝑋𝑖𝑠
where Earnings𝑖𝑠

stands for a vector of individual level characteristics. It also includes state fixed effects, year
fixed-effects and state-specific time trends. Note that equation (5) does not represent a panel data
structure. Instead, it depicts the models to be estimated based on repeated cross sections using
the CPS data, and the superscript (t) indicates the year of the CPS survey.
As will be detailed below, in Equation (5) skill-biased technological change in year 𝑡 and
census division 𝑐 negatively affects earnings of unskilled women (women with high school
education or less). On the other hand, earnings go up in response to skill-biased technological
change for skilled women (women with at least some college education). This means that in the
sample of unskilled (skilled) mothers, β1 is expected to be negative (positive). 𝑋 includes race
indicators and the age of the woman. Women in the low-skill samples have at most a high

7

school education. Therefore in these regressions we include a dummy variable to control for
whether the woman has a high school degree. The regressions using the sample of high-skilled
women include an indicator to control for the receipt of a college diploma.
Both low-skill and high-skill samples include only unmarried women. The reason for
focusing on unmarried women is because the validity of the instrument can be in question in case
of married women. More specifically, the instrument has an impact on women’s earnings but it
would also influence the earnings of the husbands if husbands are working. This means that in
the outcome equation (e.g. the birth weight equation) where married women’s earnings are used
as an endogenous explanatory variable, the instrument would have a direct impact on the
outcome. This is because the error term of the outcome equation would contain husbands’
earnings and thus the instrument would be correlated with the error term.
The second data set pertains to almost 14 million birth certificates in the United States for
the years 1989-2004, covering conceptions for the years 1988-2004. These data are employed to
estimate the reduced form equation (6)

(6)

𝑡
where 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑠
represents various outcomes such as the birth weight of the child, an indicator

variable if the newborn is of low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams), gestational age, the extent
of prenatal care consumption during pregnancy, measures of late initiation of prenatal care, and
indicators of smoking and drinking behavior of mother 𝑖 who gave birth in state 𝑠 during year 𝑡.
Note that the vector of explanatory variables 𝑋 is identical in both the reduced form and first
stage equations (5) and (6) for the two-sample instrumental variable strategy to be viable (Inoue
and Solon 2010).

Taking the ratio of the coefficient of the instrument from the reduced form estimates using birth
certificate data (𝛼1 in Equation 6), and the coefficient of the instrument from the first stage
estimation using CPS data (𝛽1 in Equation 5) provides the two-sample instrumental variables
estimate of the impact of earnings on birth outcomes.4 That is, we calculate 𝛾 = 𝛼1 /𝛽1.
We use the delta method to calculate the standard error of the estimate of 𝛾 (Inoue and Solon
2010, Dee and Evans 2003). Specifically, assuming that the covariance of 𝛽1 and 𝛼1 is zero, the
variance of the estimated two-sample IV coefficient is

The Instrument
We use a measure of census-division- and year-specific skill-biased technological change
as an instrument for mothers’ earnings. Let aggregate output, 𝑌𝑐𝑡 , produced in a census division
𝑐 during year 𝑡 be described by the following CES production function

𝑌𝑐𝑡 =

𝜎−1
[(𝐴𝐻𝑐𝑡 𝐻𝑐𝑡 ) 𝜎

+

𝜎
𝜎−1 𝜎−1
(𝐴𝐿𝑐𝑡 𝐿𝑐𝑡 ) 𝜎 ] ,

The two-sample instrumental variables approach was pioneered by Angrist and Krueger (1992),
who used the two stage instrumental variables estimator to estimate the effect of age at school entry on
educational attainment. Other applications of this estimator can be found in Lindo and Stoecker (2011)
who investigated the criminal propensity of Vietnam veterans, Dee and Evans (2003) who examined the
impact of drinking on the educational attainment of teenagers, as well as Currie and Yelowitz (2000) who
analyzed the impact of housing project on the welfare of children. For a succinct technical discussion of
the estimator see Inoue and Solon (2010).

where 𝐻 and 𝐿 stand for efficiency-adjusted high-skill and low-skill labor inputs, respectively.
𝐴𝐻 and 𝐴𝐿 are factor-augmenting technology terms. The parameter 𝜎 is the elasticity of
substitution between low-skilled and high-skilled labor and based on previous work, it is
assumed to be greater than one. Following Autor et al. (2008) we set 𝜎 = 1.6.
Assuming competitive factor markets, the first order conditions result in the following
relationship between the relative wage of skilled and unskilled workers, 𝑊𝐻𝑐𝑡 /𝑊𝐿𝑐𝑡 , and the
relative supply of skills, 𝐻𝑐𝑡 /𝐿𝑐𝑡 :

where WH and WL represent efficiency-adjusted wages of skilled and unskilled labor,
respectively. Using data on wages and labor supply of both low-skilled and high-skilled labor
from the CPS, we back out the value of 𝐴𝐻𝑐𝑡 /𝐴𝐿𝑐𝑡 . Following Autor et al (1998), Autor et al
𝐴

(2008), and Goldin and Katz (2007), we use ln( 𝐴𝐻𝑐𝑡 ) as an index for skill-biased technological
𝐿𝑐𝑡

change. We employ this index of skill-biased technological change as an instrument for mothers’
earnings.
We use the nine census divisions (New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central,
West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain and
Pacific) as the relevant geographic units in which technology is determined. This means that we
aggregate H, L and W to the census division-level in each year and obtain the skill-biased
𝐴

technological change index ln( 𝐴𝐻𝑐𝑡 ) by census division and year. The skill-biased technology
𝐿𝑐𝑡

index, of course, can be calculated at the state-level as well. The reason to obtain the index at the
census division-level, rather than the state level, is that it may be argued that technological
10

change at the state level could be influenced by states’ labor market conditions, making it
potentially endogenous. Calculating the skill-biased technology index at the census division
level circumvents this potential complication. Put differently, in our framework, it is assumed
that technological change is determined at the regional level and that the states which make up a
particular region are exposed to the technology shocks of that region.
Although a change in ln(AHct/ALct) can arise for a number of reasons, ranging from
variations in the relative prices of non-labor inputs to the evolution of labor market institutions,
the consensus in the literature is that the primary driver of ln(AH/AL) is skill-biased technological
change (Autor et al., 2008; Goldin and Katz, 2007). A related point is whether skill-biased
technological change and the resultant change in the relative demand for skilled workers would
induce a policy reaction, which would render our instrument invalid. For example, if state
governments increase minimum wages in reaction to a change in technology favoring skilled
workers, the instrument would be invalid to the extent that the minimum wage has a direct
impact on infant health. However, the scenario that states increase the level of minimum wages
in response to technology shocks does not seem realistic because minimum wages are not
adjusted frequently. Mocan and Unel (2013) provide detailed evidence on the validity of this
instrument. The construction of the instrument using the CPS data is explained in the Appendix.
III. Data
We use individual-level data from two sources. First, we use birth certificates of the
universe of births in the United States for the years 1989-2004, obtained from the Natality Detail
Files of the National Center for Health Statistics. The birth certificate data contain a record for
each child born in the United States, and each record includes information regarding the child’s
birth weight, as well as demographic characteristics of the mother, such as age, education, race,
11

and marital status. In addition, information regarding the mother’s use of prenatal care and the
mother’s smoking and drinking behavior are available. We use only birth certificates for
singleton births to unmarried mothers who are at least 20 years old. We use data only until 2004
because geographic identifiers are not available in the public use data starting in 2005.
Geographic identifiers –in particular the state of residence of mothers—are essential in order to
be able to match our measure of skill-biased technology shocks described above with individual
mothers in the data set. We use data starting with the 1989 birth certificates because some states
did not report important demographic information on their certificates prior to that year.
Specifically, California and Texas did not report mothers’ education until 1989. Education is a
crucial variable for our analysis, and to avoid excluding populous states of California and Texas
we start the analysis using 1989 birth certificates.
We use the birth weight of the infants (recorded in grams) from the birth certificates as a
measure of infant health. A second measure is an indicator variable that takes the value of one if
the infant is low birth weight (less that 2,500 grams). We also use gestational age as an
indicator of the newborn’s health because gestational age is correlated with birth weight. Since
one potential mechanism for how income can affect infant health is prenatal care, we make use
of several measures of prenatal care consumption contained in the birth certificates. There are
two particular variables of interest: The number of prenatal care visits attended by the mother,
and the month of the pregnancy during which prenatal care was initiated. The number of prenatal
care visits is the actual number of times that the mother visited a physician for prenatal
consultations. The month of the pregnancy when the first prenatal care visit took place is an
indication for how early the mother sought prenatal care.5 Since it is important that prenatal care

5

If no prenatal care took place, then the month of the first prenatal care visit is coded to be equal to 10
12

starts early in the pregnancy we also create a dummy variable that indicates whether prenatal
care was initiated late. We consider prenatal care to have commenced late if the first prenatal
care visits occurred after the first trimester of the pregnancy, i.e. if prenatal care was initiated in
the fourth month of the pregnancy or thereafter.
Smoking behavior is recorded using a dummy variable indicating whether the mother
smoked during the pregnancy, and drinking behavior is similarly captured using a dummy
variable indicating whether the mother consumed alcohol during the pregnancy. While most
states started reporting smoking and drinking information in 1989, some states started reporting
this information later. Louisiana and Nebraska started reporting smoking and drinking behavior
information in1990, Oklahoma started in 1991, New York in 1995, and Indiana in 1999.
California and South Dakota never reported data on smoking or drinking.6
After restricting the birth certificate data to records of only singleton births to unmarried
mothers aged 20-49 where demographic information of the mother is available, we end up with a
data set of 13,756,856 birth certificates.7 We merge these birth certificates with the measure of
skill-biased technological change described in Section 2 using the year of conception and the
census division of residence of the mother.
In our two-sample design, we combine information from the birth certificates regarding
the circumstances of each birth with information regarding mothers’ earnings. We obtain
individual-level earnings data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Demographic File.
Since the birth certificate data are for mothers of age 20-49, we only use the earnings for females

Beginning in 2003, some states adopted a revised version of the standard birth certificate that changed
the way in which smoking behavior of the mother is recorded. Specifically, the revised version contains
smoking participation information separately for each trimester of the pregnancy. In those cases we
recode data on the different trimesters to be consistent with the measure of smoking used during the other
years.
7
We drop women whose marital status was imputed.
6

13

who are between 20 and 49 years old in the CPS data. The CPS contains an income measure
indicating annual personal income from wages and salaries for the calendar year prior to the
survey. We construct the measure of real weekly earnings by dividing the real value (in 2005
Dollars) of annual personal income from wages and salaries in the previous calendar year by the
number of weeks worked in the previous calendar year.8 For women in the CPS sample, the year
during which the reported income was earned is therefore the year prior to the CPS survey year.
In order to match the conception date of infants with the date when personal income was
earned by the mother, we subtract nine months from the date of birth of infants from the birth
certificates and match the resulting year with the year during which income was earned by
women in the CPS sample.9 For example, if a child was born in November of 2000, then
conception occurred in February of 2000. Real weekly earnings during February of 2000 are then
obtained from the 2001 survey year of the CPS sample.
After restricting the CPS sample to women between the ages of 20 and 49, and dropping
observations with missing demographic information, the resulting data set contains 124,491
observations. We merge these observations with the measure of skill-biased technological
change described in Section 2 using the year during which income was earned and the censusdivision of residence of the woman.
We also perform analyses by Medicaid receipt of the mother. We can directly identify
Medicaid recipients in the CPS data but Medicaid status is not observed on birth certificates.
Therefore, we use parity as a proxy when using birth certificate data. First-born children are less
likely to be Medicaid eligible than parity of two or greater. This is due to the fact that the income
We exclude women who were employed less than full time in the previous calendar year, and also
exclude women who are self-employed.
9
In our main results we assume that a pregnancy lasts nine months because gestational length is often
missing on the birth certificates, and it is measured with error.

threshold for Medicaid eligibility is a function of family size, and the larger the family, the lower
the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility.
As described earlier, we use the census division of the state of residence of the mother to
match skill-biased technology shocks with births. There are some births in the data that occurred
in a state other than the state of residence of the mother. For example, while a mother may be a
resident of California, she may have given birth in Illinois. In this case, the birth certificate
would be reported by the state of Illinois and will include all items reported by the state of
Illinois. Some items reported by Illinois may, however, not be reported by the state of California.
For example, smoking information is never reported by California, but is included in the Illinois
birth certificates starting in 1989. We exclude such cases from our analyses. In order to check
whether women who give birth in states other than their state of residence significantly influence
the results, we also estimated specifications that include mothers who gave birth in a state
different from the state where they reside. The results did not change.
Since our empirical strategy described above relies on estimating the impact of earnings
on mothers’ behavior and the impact of earnings on health outcomes of newborns separately for
low-skill mothers and high-skill mothers, we present summary statistics separately for low-skill
mothers (Table 1 and Table 3) and for high-skill mothers (Table 2 and Table 4). We assign the
skill level of women by using information about their educational attainment. We classify
women as being low-skilled if they have at most a high school diploma. Women are considered
high-skilled if they have at least some college education. This information is available both on
birth certificates and in the CPS data.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the variables obtained from the birth certificate
data pertaining to low-skilled women, and Table 2 displays the same information for high-skilled
15

women. Tables 3 and 4 present the descriptive statistics of the CPS data related to these two
groups, respectively. The instrument (the measure of skill-biased technology change described
above) will be used both in the reduced-form regression using the birth certificates and also in
the first-stage regression using the income data from the CPS. Thus the instrument is merged
with both the birth certificates data and the CPS data. The first rows of Tables 1 to 4 show that
the descriptive statistics of the instrument are very similar between the two data sets.
Tables 1 and 2 show that the average birth weight for children of low-skill mothers
(3,232 grams) is less than the average birth weight of children of high-skill mothers (3,277
grams) at all parity levels. This is a difference of 45 grams, or about 1.6 ounces. The same
difference exists between first-born babies of low-skill vs. high skill mothers and higher parity
levels. On the other hand, the gestational age is the same between high-skill and low-skill
mothers. The tables also show that low-skill mothers have one fewer prenatal care visits during
their pregnancy in comparison to high-skill mothers (10 vs. 11 visits). Moreover, low-skill
mothers initiate prenatal care later than high-skill mothers and the percentage of low-skill
mothers who smoked during their pregnancy (27%) is much higher compared to the percentage
of high-skill mothers who smoked during their pregnancy (16%).
Smoking and drinking are dummy variables to indicate if the mother smoked cigarettes or
consumed alcohol during pregnancy. Prenatal Care Late is a dummy variable that takes the
value of one if the prenatal care was initiated after the first trimester during pregnancy. Prenatal
Care Visits is the number of visits to a prenatal care provider during the pregnancy. Prenatal
Care Delay represents the delay in the receipt of prenatal care in months. For example, if the
mother started receiving prenatal care in the fifth month of her pregnancy, this variable takes the
value of five. If she never received prenatal care, the variable is assigned the value of 10.

Average real weekly earnings of low-skill unmarried women in the CPS sample
presented in Table 3 is about $456 in 2005 dollars, and it is $700 in the sample of high-skill
unmarried women in Table 4. There are differences in the average characteristics of women in
the CPS samples compared to the characteristics of mothers obtained from the birth certificates.
Women in the CPS sample tend to be older on average, though the minimum age is 20 and the
maximum age is 49 in both samples. Comparing Table 1 with Table 3 shows that the proportion
of women with no high school diploma is larger in the low-skill sample of the birth certificate
data and comparing Table 2 with Table 4 shows that the proportion of women with a college
degree is higher in the CPS sample of the high-skill women.
Pregnant women on Medicaid might not alter their consumption of prenatal care in
reaction to a change in income as they already have access to care. Thus, we estimate the
models by likely Medicaid status of mothers, and Tables 3 and 4 also provide descriptive
statistics by Medicaid receipt of mothers.

IV. Results
Table 5 presents the results pertaining to low-skilled women. We report the results for
the birth weight equation, the equation for the probability of having a low birth weight baby
(lighter than 2,500 grams), for gestational age of the baby at birth, for mother’s smoking and
drinking during pregnancy as well as three measures of prenatal care.

All regressions control

for individual demographic characteristics, as well as state fixed-effects, year fixed-effects and
state-specific trends. We report standard errors that are clustered at the census division by age

17

group level in order to allow for correlated error terms for mothers of similar age within a census
division.10
For each outcome, Table 5 presents two sets of results. Column 2 and 3 present the
results obtained from regressions that use all births, regardless of parity. In other words, these
regressions use all newborns irrespective of whether they are the first child of the mother, or
whether they represent the second birth, and so on. The table also presents the results obtained
from first-born infants, displayed in the two right-most columns.
Two-sample IV requires both samples to include the same variables. The following
variables, which exist both in the CPS and the birth certificates, are included as control variables
in each regression: the race of the mother, the age of the mother, whether the mother has a high
school diploma (in the low-kill sample), whether she has a college diploma (in the high-skill
sample).
The first row of Table 5 shows the first-stage results, as well as the reduced form and the
IV estimates pertaining to the sample of all births (all parity) and the sample of first-borns. The
first stage is the same in both samples as it is obtained from the CPS.11 In fact, the first stage is
the same for all outcomes other than smoking and drinking. The reason why the first-stage
regression is different in smoking and drinking regressions is that some states do not report
smoking or drinking information on birth certificates in some years. For example, California
never reports smoking on birth certificates. Louisiana and Oklahoma started reporting smoking

We define age groups in two-year intervals (i.e. 20 and 21 years old, 22 and 23 years old, etc.)
Combined with nine census divisions, this results in 135 clusters.
10

Observations with imputed earnings are not used. Birth certificates reveal the birth day of the child;
thus we are able to impute the month of conception which is used to match the timing of the CPS survey.
This way, the year in which earnings information is obtained from the CPS is aligned with the year in
which the woman was pregnant.

information on birth certificates in 1990. In cases like these, birth certificates from these states
cannot be used in reduced form regressions for smoking. For consistency, we omitted the same
state and years from the CPS data in running the first-stage regressions.
The instrument is strong with an F-value of almost 14. The birth weight is in levels, and
the real weekly earnings are in logarithms. Column 3 of Table 5 shows that in the sample of all
births, the IV estimate indicates that a 10% increase in real weekly earnings increases the birth
weight of children of unskilled married women by only 12.3 grams, which is a small impact.
The same increase in earnings produces an increase in birth weight by about 9 grams in the
sample of first-born babies. The probability of low birth goes down by 4-to-5 percentage points
for low-skill women due to doubling in earnings and the gestational age goes up by about 0.7
weeks.
Row 4 of Table 5 shows that an increase in income has a positive effect on prenatal care
consumption. Specifically, if real weekly earnings double the number of prenatal care visits
during pregnancy goes up by about two visits both in the sample of birth at all parity level as
well as in the sample of low-skill mothers of firstborns. The same increase in income generates a
shortening in the delay of the initiation of prenatal care (i.e. women start consuming prenatal
care sooner after getting pregnant), shown in row 5. Consistent with these results, we also
observe that an increase in income of low-skilled married women reduces their propensity to
initiate late prenatal care (after the first trimester). Table 5 also shows that an increase in income
has no impact on drinking during pregnancy or on smoking.12

While there exists an extensive literature on the effect of cigarette prices on smoking (Tekin, Mocan
and Liang 2009; Cawley, Markowitz and Tauras 2004; Colman, Grossman, and Joyce 2003; Becker,
Grossman and Murphy 1994), the evidence on the income elasticity of smoking is scant. Maternal
smoking behavior has also received attention (Fingerhut, Kleinman, and Kendrick 1990). However, the
focus of the research has again been the effect of price changes on smoking behavior of women, not on
income (Evans and Ringel 1999; Evans, Ringel, and Stech 1999; Ringel and Evans 2001). For example

12

The upshot of Table 5 is that in case of low-skilled unmarried mothers, an increase in
income, triggered by a regional shock to the relative demand for skilled labor, increases the
consumption of prenatal care. This produces a small increase in gestational age of the newborn
and a very small positive impact on birth weight.
Table 6 displays a different picture in case of high-skilled unmarried women. In this case,
an increase in real weekly earnings has no statistically significant impact on birth weight or
prenatal case consumption. The reduced forms are not significant in birth weight equations.
Furthermore, the instrument is not powerful in the first-stage regressions. The age interval of
women in the high-skill sample is also 20-to-49 as was the case in the low-skill sample. The
high-skill sample, by definition, consists of women who have at least some college education.
Some of these women may still be enrolled in college at the age of 20. Therefore, we also ran
the regressions of high-skilled women sample with those who are 25 or older. The results were
very similar.

Ringel and Evans (2001) investigate how women’s smoking behavior during pregnancy is affected by
cigarette taxes and find that higher cigarette taxes reduce smoking rates among pregnant women. They
find that the quit behavior of pregnant women is more sensitive to changes in the prices of cigarettes than
the quit behavior of non-pregnant women. The authors acknowledge that income is an essential control
variable, but they are unable to control for it using only data from the Natality Detail Files. Limited
evidence on the income elasticity of smoking suggests that whether income elasticity is positive or
negative varies systematically across time periods, countries, and demographic groups. For high-income
countries like the U.S. the sign appears to have reversed over time, so that cigarettes appear to have
switched from being a normal good to an inferior good (Cheng and Kenkel 2010; Wasserman et al. 1991).
Kenkel et al. (2011) use data on 7 waves of the Current Population Survey’s Tobacco Use Supplement
matched with income data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement from 1993 to 2007. The
authors find that while the income elasticity of smoking in a cross sectional OLS specification is positive,
that income elasticity is negative in the IV specification.

20

Results by Medicaid Status of Mothers
Low-skilled (low-educated) women might be covered by Medicaid, and therefore an
increase in income might not translate to increased prenatal care consumption. To further
investigate which type of women are impacted by an increase in income, we ran the birth weight,
gestational age and input demand regressions for both low-skill and high-skill women by their
Medicaid status. For example, Table 7 presents the results obtained from birth weight
regressions that use the sample of Medicaid Non-recipients. These are unmarried women who
are not on Medicaid.13 Their weekly earnings are higher than earnings of women who are on
Medicaid. The descriptive statistics in Table 3 show that for low-skilled unmarried women the
average real weekly earnings are $471 if they are not on Medicaid, and it is about $324 if they
are Medicaid recipients. Similarly, Table 4 shows that average real weekly earnings are $423 for
high-skilled Medicaid recipients, and it is about $713 for high-skilled women who are not on
Medicaid.
In Table 7 as well as the rest of the paper we employ the sample of first-born babies. The
results of the regressions that used all births provided very similar results. Table 7 shows that an
increase in weekly earnings, triggered by a skill-biased technology shock has an impact on birth
weight in case of low-skilled Non-Medicaid Recipient low-skill mothers. Earnings have no
impact on birth weight in case of high-skilled mothers.
Table 8 displays the results of the analysis of the propensity of having a low birth weight
baby in the sample of mothers who are not on Medicaid. Consistent with Table 7, an increase in

As described earlier, we can directly identify Medicaid recipients in the CPS data, but Medicaid status
is not observed in the birth certificate data. Thus,we approximate the Medicaid status on birth certificates
using parity.
13

21

earnings lowers the probability of having a low birth weight baby in the sample of low-skill
women who are not on Medicaid. The magnitude of the impact is small: doubling of earnings
lowers the probability of having a low birth weight baby by only five percentage points. A
similar inference is obtained when using gestational age as an indicator for infant health, shown
in Table 9.
Tables 10-12 display the results pertaining to models where various measures of prenatal
care are used as dependent variables. Once again, we focus on mothers who are not Medicaid
recipients. Table 10, which displays the results for prenatal visits, shows that an increase in
weekly earnings increases total prenatal care visits during pregnancy in the sample of low-skilled
women, but it decreases the prenatal care visits of high-skill women. Table 11 demonstrates that
a 50% increase in weekly earnings of low-skill women reduces the delay in the initiation of
prenatal care by about a month and Table 12 shows that a 50% increase in income of the same
group of women reduces the probability of initiating prenatal care late (after the first trimester of
pregnancy) by 11 percentage points. Earnings have no impact on prenatal care consumption of
high-skill mothers regardless of how prenatal care is measured.
Grossman and Joyce (1990) find a small impact of prenatal care on birth weight.
Specifically, they report that a month of prenatal care delay causes a reduction of birth weight by
37 grams for black mothers, and it has not a statistically significant effect in case of white
mothers. Our finding is consistent with their results. We find that mothers’ income has a small
impact on the use of prenatal medical care. Given that prenatal care has a small impact on birth
weight reported by Grossman and Joyce (1990), the impact of income on birth weight through
the channel of prenatal care is expected to be low.

22

Previous research has shown a detrimental impact of smoking while pregnant on birth
weight. Much of this research is based on the intensity of maternal smoking; i.e. the number of
cigarettes smoked during pregnancy (e.g. Grossman and Joyce 1990, Rosenzweig and Schultz
1983), although the inference obtained from Evans and Ringel (1999) is based on smoking
participation during pregnancy as we do in this paper. Researchers either considered cigarette
consumption as an exogenous variable, or investigated the impact of cigarettes on birth weight
driven by changes in cigarette prices. Information on the response of maternal smoking to
income is limited. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983) found that the elasticity of maternal smoking
to husband income is small, with an elasticity of 0.07. Table 13 shows that in the sample of
mothers who are not Medicaid recipients, weekly earnings have no impact on smoking regardless
of the skill level of the mother. Therefore, a change in smoking participation (initiation or
cessation of smoking during pregnancy) due to a change in income is not an important avenue
through which birth weight is impacted. Similarly, Table 14 shows that alcohol consumption
during pregnancy does not react to variations in mother’s earnings. Caution should be exercised
here because the first-stage regressions are not powerful in smoking and alcohol consumption.
We also estimated the same set of regressions using the sample of mothers who are on
Medicaid. The results are presented in the Appendix. Weekly earnings have no impact on birth
weight or on the probability of having a low-birth baby either for high-skill or low-skill mothers.
Similarly, income has no impact on smoking or drinking. The impact of weekly earnings has a
small positive impact on prenatal care consumption for low skill mothers with p-values of about
0.09, and the same is true for gestational age. However, the first-stage regressions of these
models, displayed in tables A4-A6 are very weak with an F-statistic of 4.1. That is, the

23

instrument is not powerful enough to explain the variation in weekly earnings of Medicaidrecipient mothers. Consequently, no reliable inference can be made on this sample.

V. Conclusion
Although the impact of income on infant health is important to investigate both from a
scientific and public policy perspective, the analysis is complicated because of the endogeneity
of income. For example, maternal income or household income is likely to be correlated with
mother attributes and household characteristics that may directly impact the birth weight of the
infant. In this paper we use a two-sample instrumental variables strategy to identify the causal
impact of mothers’ income on the birth weight and gestational age of newborns. We use birth
record data obtained from almost 14 million births between 1989 and 2004, which contains
information about mother characteristics, the birth weight of the newborn and the location of the
birth.
Following the literature on skill-biased technological change and wage inequality, we
create a census division- and year-specific measure of skill-biased technological change as an
instrument in the first-stage earnings regressions. Because earnings information is not available
on birth certificates, we use micro data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate
first-stage earnings equations for women who are observationally similar to the mothers of the 14
million newborns. Specifically, the CPS women and the mothers on the birth certificates are
similar in such dimensions as state of residence, age, race, marital status and education. The
reduced form equations are based on birth certificates where the birth weight of the newborn
depends on exogenous mother characteristics and the census-division level skill-biased

24

technology parameter. This two-sample instrumental variables design allows us recover the
structural estimate of the impact of mothers’ earnings on birth weight and on gestational age.
We also estimate input demand functions for smoking, drinking, and prenatal medical
care consumption of mothers using data provided by birth certificates. Together, these results
reveal insights into not only the impact of income on infant health, but also on the pathways
through which the impact of income operates.
The results show that an increase in weekly earnings has no impact on prenatal care
consumption or the demand for alcohol or cigarettes for mothers who are likely to be on
Medicaid. For low-skilled mothers who are not likely to be on Medicaid, an increase in weekly
earnings generates a small increase in prenatal care consumption, and it reduces the delay in the
initiation of prenatal care.

Consequently, the increase in income produces an improvement in

birth outcomes of newborns of these mothers although the magnitude of the impact is small.
Specifically, if a mother’s earnings double, this produces a weight gain of the newborn by about
100 grams and an increase in gestational age by 0.7 weeks. The propensity to smoke and to
consume alcohol are not impacted by mothers’ earnings. An increase in mothers’ earnings has
no impact on input demand or birth weight of newborns in the sample of mothers who are likely
to be on Medicaid, regardless of whether they are high-skilled or low-skilled.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the census division by age group level are in parentheses, sample sizes in brackets. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. First stage
results were obtained using data from the Annual Demographic File of the Current population survey with earnings for the years 1988-2004. Regressions also include
a quadratic term in age, controls for having a high school diploma, race, state dummies, year dummies, and state-specific year trends. Reduced form results were
obtained using birth certificate data covering conceptions during years 1988-2004; regressions include identical control variables as the first stage regressions. The
IV estimate is the ratio of the reduced form coefficient over the first stage coefficient. Prenatal Care Visits are the number of times the mother visited a health care
provider for prenatal consultations during the pregnancy. Prenatal Care Delay is the number of months that the mother waited before seeking prenatal care. Prenatal
Care Late is a dummy variable indicating whether the mother initiated prenatal care after the first trimester of the pregnancy. Smoking is a dummy variable for
whether the mother smoked in during the pregnancy. Drinking is a dummy variable for whether the mother drank during the pregnancy.

Appendix
Construction of the Efficiency-adjusted Labor Inputs to create the index of Skill-biased
Technological Change
We use the March Current Population Survey (CPS) files from 1978 to 2010 (covering
earnings from 1977 to 2009) for full-time workers (those who work 35 or more hours a week)
ages 16 to 64. Self-employed people are dropped from the sample, as are allocated earnings
observations (using individual earnings allocation flags). In constructing the key variables, we
closely follow the previous labor literature on wage inequality (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Krusell
et al., 2000; Card and DiNardo, 2002; and in particular, Autor et al., 2008).
Each individual’s average weekly earnings are formed by dividing annual income from
wages and salaries by the number of weeks worked during the previous year. Earnings are
deflated using the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index with a base year of 2005. We make
two adjustments for topcoded earnings. First, following Autor et al. (2008) income of workers
with top coded earnings is imputed by multiplying the annual topcode amount by 1.5. Second,
starting in 1996, topcoded earnings values are assigned the mean of all topcoded earners. In these
cases, we simply reassign the topcoded values to all such observations and again multiply by 1.5.
Workers whose weekly earnings below $70 in 2005 dollars are dropped, as are those non-fullyear workers (i.e., those who work less than 40 weeks) whose weekly earnings exceed 1/40th the
top-coded value of weekly earnings.
We construct the series for high-skill and low-skill labor input and wages as follows. The
data in each year in each state are divided into 24 distinct groups characterized by 2 sexes, 4
education categories (Education <= 11 years, Education = 12 years, 13 <= Education <= 15
years, and Education >= 16 years) and four potential experience categories (0-9 years, 10-19

44

years, 20-29, 30+ years). Potential experience are calculated as Min{age–years of schooling–6,
age–16} following Autor et al. (2008). In calculating each group’s average weekly earnings,
earnings are weighted by the product of the corresponding CPS sampling weight and weeks
worked.
We assume that the high-skill labor class consists of college or college-plus workers and
the workers with some college; and the low-skill labor class consists of those who have no
college education. Groups within a class are assumed to be perfect substitutes and we use group
relative weekly earnings of full-time workers as weights for the aggregation of labor inputs into
skilled and unskilled classes. Standard in this literature is the assumption that relative wages
equal relative efficiencies of labor. More specifically, following Autor et al. (2008), we choose
the group that contains male workers with less than 12 years of education and with less than 10
years of potential experience as the base group. A relative wage measure is then constructed by
dividing each group’s average weekly earnings by the average weekly earnings of the base
group. The relative efficiency index measure for each group, 𝑞𝑔 , is computed as the arithmetic
mean of the relative wage measures in that group over 1977 to 2009. Then the total efficiencyadjusted labor input in each class is given by
𝐻𝑡 = ∑ 𝑞𝑔 𝐻𝑔𝑡
𝑔∈𝐺𝐻

𝐿𝑡 = ∑ 𝑞𝑔 𝑁𝑔𝑡
𝑔∈𝐺𝐿

where 𝑁𝑔𝑡 represents the total labor weeks used in production by group 𝑔 in year 𝑡. Since 𝐻 and
𝐿 are efficiency-adjusted labor inputs, the corresponding earnings 𝑊𝐻 and 𝑊𝐿 are also
efficiency-adjusted. Following Krusell et al. (2000), they are calculated as

45

𝑊𝐻𝑡 = ∑ 𝜔𝑔𝑡 𝑁𝑔𝑡 /𝐻𝑡
𝑔∈𝐺𝐻

𝑊𝐿𝑡 = ∑ 𝜔𝑔𝑡 𝑁𝑔𝑡 /𝐿𝑡 ,
𝑔∈𝐺𝐿

where 𝜔𝑔𝑡 represents the average weekly earnings of group 𝑔 in year 𝑡.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the census division by age group level are in parentheses. *** p <
0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. First stage results were obtained using data from the Annual Demographic
File of the Current population survey, covering earnings for the years 1988-2004. Regressions also
include state dummies, year dummies, and state-specific year trends. The reduced form results were
obtained using the birth certificate data for conceptions during the years 1988-2004 and regressions
include identical control variables as the first stage regressions. The IV estimate is the ratio of the reduced
form coefficient over the first stage coefficient. Low-skill refers to women with a high school education
or less; high-skill refers to women with at least some college education. Standard errors for the IV
estimate were calculated using the Delta method.
