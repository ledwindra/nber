Our principal finding is that in cities where homeowners are more leveraged--i.e., have higher loan-to-value ratios--house prices react more sensitively to city-specific shocks, such as changes in per-capita income.  This finding is consistent with recent theories which emphasize the role of collateralized borrowing in shaping the behavior of asset prices.\n\n",
