    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper will discuss the role of derivative products in international capital flows, especially in providing a means of both reducing and enhancing market risks associated with given net flows.  It will emphasize how derivatives can be used to evade risk-control or prudential regulation, circumvent capital controls, drive the dynamics of currency instabilities, and obscure true risk positions and thereby undermine the usefulness of balance of payments capital account categories.\n\n",
