I. Introduction
Syndicated bank lending is the Chevy Cavalier of international financial markets.
For the same reasons that Motor Trend devotes little space to basic transportation,
academics pay little attention to international bank lending, preferring to concentrate on
rapidly growing market segments like the sport-utility vehicle and the international bond
market, or exotic products like high-performance sports cars and derivative credit
instruments. What is relevant to the vast majority of consumers thus receives relatively
little attention.
In this paper we argue that more attention to international bank lending is
warranted for three reasons. First, the syndicated bank loan remains one of the
workhorses of international capital markets. As Table 1 shows, loan commitments have
been every bit as important as bonds in the first half of the 1990s. While new bond issues
rose from negligible levels at the beginning of the 1990s to more than $100 billion in
calendar year 1996 and $128 billion in 1997 before falling back in the wake of the Asian
crisis, loan commitments have also trended steadily upward, actually exceeding bond
issues in every year through 1995 but one (1993) and nipping at the heels of new bond
issues in both 1996 and 1997.
Second, international bank lending is particularly important for the private-sector
borrowers whose participation is the distinctive feature of international capital markets in
the 1990s and who are likely to dominate the market to an even greater extent in the
future as the privatization of state enterprise and the liberalization of capital markets
proceed. Already one of the striking contrasts between bond and bank lending is the
extent to which sovereigns and other governmental borrowers continue to rely on the
bond market, while private borrowers are disproportionately important to the market in
international bank loans. This is what we should expect, of course, to the extent that

2
private-sector borrowers about whom information is least complete establish long-term
relationships with banks as a way of resolving information problems. But it means that
the emerging-market bond spreads on which most recent analysis focuses are likely to
provide little, and for that matter potentially misleading, information about what is going
on in this market segment (as Figure 1 suggests).1
A third reason for focussing on loans is the controversy that has swirled around
the behavior of international bank lending in the wake of the Asian crisis. Spreads on
syndicated bank loans show relatively little variation compared to spreads on
international bonds, raising questions about whether bank lenders are properly pricing
country and credit risk. Low interest rates in Tokyo are said to have encouraged Japanese
banks to develop an excessive appetite for emerging-market debt. Growing competition
in Europe as a result of the Single Market is said to have eroded domestic margins and to
have encouraged second-tier European banks to scramble into Asian markets in search of
yield.2 Moreover, with banks enjoying deposit insurance, lender-of-last-resort services,
and in some cases implicit and explicit guarantees—along with the expectation that they
will be able to withdraw their funds on demand insofar as the IMF injects offsetting
resources in response to a crisis—it has been suggested that spread compression on

Figure 1 plots average spreads on all new loan commitments and new bond issues in the 1990s. In only
half the quarters do average spreads on loans and bonds move in the same direction. Note that average
loan spreads are much smaller than those for bonds and move in a smaller band. A clue to the reason lies
in the contrasting reactions to the Mexican and Asian crisis. Following the devaluation of the Mexican
peso in December 1994, bond and bank loan spreads in the primary market diverge. The decline in bond
market spreads reflects a sharp change in the composition of the pool of borrowers: only the best quality
issuers were able to tap the bond markets, leaving high-risk borrowers, from Latin America in particular,
effectively rationed out of the market. In comparison, the commercial loan market, dominated by Asian
borrowers, was less affected. By contrast, following the onset of the Asian crisis in the last quarter of
1997, new bank loan commitments fell sharply and spreads increased (to their highest quarterly level
since the start of the time period under consideration). The response of primary bond market spreads was
muted by comparison.
Indeed, one of the striking features of bank lending to emerging markets, as we shall see, is the extent to
which it is dominated by Asian borrowers.

3
syndicated bank loans to developing countries is an indication of the extent of moral
hazard.
All these are reasons why bank lending to emerging markets is deserving of study.
Yet, to our knowledge, there exists no systematic study of the determinants of the pricing
of international bank loans in the 1990s that can be used to shed light on these issues.
This paper takes a first step in that direction. It analyzes the pricing of over 4500
international loan commitments to developing countries between 1991 and 1997, years
which span the recent period of heavy lending to emerging markets. This is, in principle,
the entire population of bank loans to emerging markets. We pay special attention to
problems of sample selection, since there are good reasons to suspect that borrowers that
rely on loan commitments for external finance differ in important respects from other
debtors. We analyze both the borrowing decision of enterprises and governments and the
pricing decisions of their bank underwriters, addressing problems of selectivity bias by
treating the two decisions jointly.
Section II reviews the theoretical literature on bank lending to emerging markets
with the goal of identifying what is special about bank loan commitments as opposed to
other forms of international borrowing and lending. Section III introduces our data set
and describes its features. (More details appear in Appendix A.). Subsequent sections
then consider the roles of short-term debt and domestic bank credit (Section IV), the
determinants of access to international bank loans (Section V), and the implications of
analyzing the commitment and pricing decisions jointly, with a focus on differences in
pricing across regions and over time (Section VI). The bond market providing the
obvious benchmark for assessing our results, we summarize our parallel analysis of the

4
bond issuance decision and launch spreads on emerging market bonds (Eichengreen and
Mody 1998a,b) in Appendix B.

II. Thinking About Loan Commitments
While international bank lending is no new phenomenon, in the century preceding
World War II the role of banks was limited to underwriting bond issues and to extending
trade credits and making interbank deposits. This changed in the 1970s with the rise of
intermediate term, floating rate, general obligation syndicated bank loans to developing
countries. Syndicated bank lending exploded from less than $50 billion in 1972 to more
than $300 billion in 1982, when it was interrupted by Mexico’s debt moratorium. Net
capital flows then reversed direction. Only at the end of the 1980s, with the completion
of the major Brady Plan reschedulings, did the volume of bank lending to developing
countries recover significantly in tandem with the growth of the bond market.
The rise of syndicated bank lending is typically understood in terms of three
factors: information asymmetries, contract enforcement, and moral hazard. In turn,
changes in these factors are invoked to explain the growth of the bond market in the
1990s.
Information Asymmetries
Bond and equity issues have the advantage of speed and low transactions costs.
An infrastructure project needs only to be given a credit rating by a rating agency, at
which point it can be brought to the market. A syndicated bank loan, in contrast, must go
through a lengthy process of approval by a series of internal loan committees. It is thus
striking that relatively few infrastructure projects in emerging markets have secured
financing through securities markets. Bank loans must have other advantages.

5
An obvious explanation is that banks have sunk the costs of investing in a
technology for monitoring borrowers. The same theories of delegated monitoring that
emphasize the informational role of banks vis-à-vis smaller, less reputable domestic
borrowers similarly suggest a role for banks in providing external finance for precisely
those foreign borrowers about whom market information is least complete. These
“pecking order theories” of finance suggest that emerging market borrowers seeking
external finance graduate from bank finance to bond finance and finally to equity finance
as information about their credit worthiness becomes more complete.
One of the earliest formalizations of this notion, by Kletzer (1984), emphasized
asymmetric information about the level of the debtor’s external obligations. Kletzer
pointed out that it can be important for creditors to know the aggregate amount loaned to
a debtor (since that debtor may otherwise borrow in excess of its credit ceiling, at which
point it will have an incentive to renege on its commitments) and similarly to know the
terms of earlier loans. The role of the bank syndicate is to provide a mechanism through
which lenders can pool information. Kletzer shows that when creditors can only observe
their own loans they will lend larger amounts at higher interest rates than when there is
common information. Under relatively general conditions the borrower is better off with
observability, since the reduction in interest rates more than compensates it for the
reduction in credit availability. Hence, where information is least complete, bank loan
contracts will be incentive compatible.
This formulation is difficult to reconcile with the fact that developing countries
often appear to be able to borrow more freely from banks than bond markets (Allen
1990). This suggests that the emphasis should be placed not on the difficulty of verifying
the level of indebtedness per se, but rather on the difficulty of obtaining and evaluating

6
information about other borrower characteristics affecting the willingness and ability to
repay. While it may be difficult for bondholders to evaluate the likely construction costs
and prospective revenue stream associated with an infrastructure or manufacturing
project, commercial and investment banks have the project-evaluation capability and the
long-term relationship with the borrower needed to obtain the relevant information and
carry out this evaluation.
Note that these theories of delegated monitoring, while they can explain the
preference for bank over bond finance, cannot by themselves explain the preference for
syndicated bank lending. To this one must add another consideration, like the
assumption that individual emerging market loans are too large for individual banks to
finance given capital requirements, restrictions on loan concentrations, and prudent riskmanagement practices. Thus, syndicated bank lending provides both delegated
monitoring and portfolio diversification services. The fact that even direct syndicates (in
which there is no lead bank) usually appoint a manager or agent to act as the conduit for
information between the syndicate and borrower is consistent with this interpretation.
It is then straightforward to explain the recent rise of the bond market in terms of
improvements in the information environment. Emerging markets having strengthened
auditing, accounting and disclosure requirements for their banks and corporates, the
informational advantages of the banks eroded. But as the Asian crisis serves to remind,
there remains a significant gap in auditing, accounting and disclosure standards between
emerging and advanced-industrial countries. It is not surprising that there remains a
significant role for the banks.

7
Contracting and Recontracting
Because the banks comprising a syndicate form a cohesive group (relative to
bondholders who tend to be more numerous and heterogeneous), banks should be better
positioned to enforce debt contracts (Edwards, 1986). If concerted lending is required to
maximize the value of existing claims, a bank syndicate will be in a better position to
undertake it than a large number of disbursed bondholders. Sachs and Cohen (1982)
were among the first to argue that the cohesiveness of bank syndicates opens up
opportunities for renegotiating defaulted debts. In their model, spreads on bank loans are
lower than spreads on bonds, other things equal, since in the event of debt-servicing
difficulties bank loans can be rescheduled, while in the case of bonds there is only the
option of default. The fact that the syndicated loan sector generally allows borrowers to
raise larger sums than they would be able to obtain through the bond market is consistent
with this view. So is evidence provided by Preece and Mullineaux (1996), who show that
the response on capital markets to announcements of private financings declines with the
number of lenders in the syndicate, as if rising numbers imply rising recontracting costs,
consistent with the assumption that a role of bank syndicates is to lend where
renegotiation is likely to be important.
Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) invert the argument, pointing out that default can be
devastating for the borrower as well as the lender, so that the possibility of rescheduling
bank loans encourages borrowers to engage in brinkmanship, which renders bank loans
riskier than bonds. Bonds may be preferred to bank loans, in other words, because the
absence of sharing, majority voting and collective representation clauses heightens the
cost of default and therefore provides a precommitment technology.

8
The obvious reconciliation is that both ex ante bonding and ex post recontracting
have value. Debtors who value bonding will go through the bond market (the repetition
in this sentence is purposeful), while debtors who place a high shadow price on the ability
to recontract will borrow from banks.
Moral Hazard
Finally, there is the possibility that lending to emerging markets is undertaken by
banks because they are sheltered from the associated risks by the financial safety net.
Among the first to emphasize moral hazard in international lending were Folkerts-Landau
(1985) and Gutentag and Herring (1985), who argued that the risk premia charged on
international bank loans were likely to be smaller than those on international bonds
insofar as central banks and governments provide implicit or explicit insurance against
the risks of international bank lending. This explanation has received considerable
attention in the wake of the Asian crisis, academics and officials having argued that
banks were inclined to lend (and debtors to borrow) because they enjoyed implicit and/or
explicit guarantees.

III. Data
To shed further light on these interpretations, we consider the pricing of
syndicated bank loans to emerging markets in the 1990s. We limit our attention to loans
priced off the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR). Thus, the interest paid by the
borrower is LIBOR plus a spread, which reflects the risk premium. Over the life of the
loan, the spread stays fixed but the interest rate paid moves with LIBOR. Between 1991
and 1997, just over 5000 LIBOR-based loans were made to emerging markets. We are
able to analyze the spreads on about 4500 loans, the subset of the population for which
complete loan and country characteristics are available.

9
The Loans: Numbers, Spreads, and Issuers
East Asian borrowers have dominated the international loan market. Of the 5,115
loans issued between 1991 and 1997, 3,373 were to East Asia, followed by Latin
America and the Caribbean with 543, and Eastern Europe, Middle East and North Africa,
and South Asia each with about 350 loans.3
Table 2 shows that international loans have been made largely to private borrowers
(especially in manufacturing and finance). Public sector borrowers (as distinct from
sovereigns) have also borrowed in significant numbers, especially for infrastructure and
other services (the category “Government” in Table 2 refers to borrowings supported by
local or national governments without an identified sectoral use of proceeds).
The average spread above LIBOR is 112 basis points. For emerging market
bonds issued during the same period, spreads were significantly larger, averaging 256
basis points (Table 3). The average spread on loans remained relatively steady, ranging
from a low of 98 basis points in 1991 to a high of 117 basis points in 1994. Thus, bond
spreads are larger on average and more variable. Interestingly, the ratio of bond to loan
spreads declined over the period, from more than three between 1991 and 1993 to about
two between 1994 and 1997, perhaps indicating some maturing of the bond market. The
higher bond spreads do not simply reflect the regional composition of loans and bonds: in
fact, loan spreads are lower than bond spreads within each individual region. Loans also
have significantly shorter maturities than bonds (3-4 years verses 8-10 years on average).
Private borrowers typically pay higher spreads than public borrowers (Table 4), and
spreads are lower for loans contracted by financial institutions. Except where contracted
directly by sovereigns, loans for infrastructure and utilities command higher spreads than
3

East Asia has also been the most prominent floating-rate bond market issuer, although Latin America has

10
loans for investment in other sectors, a somewhat surprising finding in view of the
generally assumed stability of earnings in this sector. (The longer tenor of the loans in
this sector (Table 5) may partly explain the higher spreads, as we show below.)
Explanatory Variables
We used a variety of macroeconomic and financial indicators to study the loan
commitment and pricing decisions. Throughout, our goal was to keep the empirical
specification as comparable as possible to that used in our previous work on international
bonds. Thus, we regressed the loan spread (including fees) on standard macroeconomic
characteristics of the country of the borrower using data assembled principally from the
World Bank’s World Debt Tables and Global Development Finance and the IMF’s World
Economic Outlook data base and International Financial Statistics, although where
necessary we used national sources to supplement these data. As in our previous work,
we included the ratio of debt to GNP, whether the country had rescheduled in the
preceding year, the ratio of debt service to exports (the lagged rate of GDP growth in
1990 prices, denominated in domestic currency), and the variance of export growth. To
proxy for other more-difficult-to-quantify characteristics of country credit worthiness we
included the residual from a first stage regression of the most recent sovereign credit
rating (gathered from Institutional Investor Magazine and published each March and
September) on a vector of standard economic and financial determinants.4 We also
considered the share of short term debt in total commercial bank debt (provided by the

a significant presence in the fixed-rate bond market.
We included only the residual component of the credit rating since the raw credit rating is highly
correlated with a number of the other economic and financial indicators in the equation; indeed, it is well
known that the rating agencies rely on those indicators when doing the rating exercise. In identifying
explanatory variables for the first-stage regression we followed the literature on the standard
determinants of sovereign credit ratings (e.g. Cantor and Packer 1996 and Haque et al. 1996).

11
Bank of International Settlements) and the ratio of domestic credit to GDP, two variables
that turn out to be important in what follows.
As characteristics of the issuer we considered whether it was a private entity,
whether it was a supranational, and whether it had borrowed previously on the syndicated
loan market. As a measure of global credit conditions we included the log of the 3-year
U.S. treasury rate (the average maturity for loans being between 3 and 4 years). As
characteristics of the loan we included its amount, maturity, and currency of
denomination. Finally, we included the industrial classification of the borrower
(manufacturing, financial services, infrastructure and other utilities, other services, and
government).

IV. Basic Results
We use ordinary least squares regressions to highlight some of the basic
relationships in the data. The first column in Table 6 shows that loan spreads decline
with the amount loaned (reflecting economies of scale) and rise with loan maturity
(reflecting greater risk as maturity increases and suggesting that lenders value the
liquidity of short-term loans and their ability to discipline borrowers). Private loans and
Latin American borrowers pay higher spreads.
The second column introduces a variable designed to capture the importance of
relationship banking. The first time a borrower appears during the 1991 to 1997 time
frame, the variable takes the value 1; it is then incremented each time the borrower
reappears. Repeated borrowings (the number of times the borrower has come to the bank
loan market previously) have a very strong negative effect consistent with the notion that

12
relationship banking is used to overcome information asymmetries.5 Though many
borrowers came to the market only once during this period (of the 5115 borrowings, 2173
were from one-time borrowers), several borrowed on multiple occasions.6 The point
estimate in the second column of Table 6 suggests that an additional loan commitment
reduces the spread by 2.4 percent, other things equal. Note that the coefficient on the
“private” dummy becomes less significant when the relationship variable is introduced,
reflecting the higher incidence of multiple borrowing by private borrowers.7
Table 6 also indicates that borrowings in yen, and to a lesser extent deutsche
marks, carry lower spreads, other things equal. This is consistent with the presumption
that supply-side conditions (low Japanese funding costs, declining margins in Europe)
helped to fuel lending to emerging markets.8 Financial institutions also pay lower
spreads on their borrowings, consistent with the emphasis some observers have placed on
the influence of implicit and explicit guarantees. When sectoral dummies are added, the
significance of the maturity variable declines since, as noted, maturities vary between
sectors. Note that the longer maturity of lending for infrastructure projects can help
explain the unusually high spreads on such loans (referred to above), although spreads on
loans for infrastructure (the omitted sectoral control) still remain unusually high.

This interpretation should be held cautiously, for a number of reasons. For one, we have only been able
to construct a variable for repeated bank borrowings, not repeated borrowings from a syndicate headed
by the same loan arranger. And second, there is the possibility that those who are repeatedly able to
borrow from the banks differ in other ways that are not readily observed by the econometrician but are
well known to all participants in financial markets, and not just to bank lenders.
Over a thousand borrowings represented between the fourth and 10th borrowings and about 500 were for
borrowers who were entering into a loan contract on more than the tenth occasion.
However, the significance on the private dummy reappears when country characteristics are introduced.
We were also able to identify for about 3500 borrowers the nationality of the lead loan arranger. These
results are not presented at this time because many observations are lost. However, the results for a
subset of loans do tend to show, contrary to suggestions, that the existence of cross-default clauses and
proportional sharing rules have rendered bank loans to LDCs homogeneous—in other words, that the
value and pricing of a loan is not affected by the identity of the lender—that there is strong evidence here
that the identity of the arranger affects the level of the spread. Consistent with the low cost of funds in

13
In Table 7, we introduce a number of country characteristics to further explain the
spreads charged. The majority of these carry over from our earlier analysis of bond
spreads (Eichengreen and Mody 1998 a,b). The three debt variables (the debt/GNP ratio,
a dummy for debt rescheduling if one occurred in the previous year, and the debt
service/export ratio) show that, as for bonds, spreads rise with debt levels, a history of
rescheduling, and higher debt service in relation to exports. High country growth rates
enhance the ability to repay and reduce spreads; highly variable export growth, on the
other hand, raises the risk of non-payment and increases the spread. The credit rating
residual, which measures the effect of country credit rating factors not explicitly included
in our analysis, always gives a strong negative sign: a larger residual implies a better
rating and a lower spread. The directional influence of these variables is robust across
subsamples (as discussed below), although their relative importance and statistical
significance varies.9
To get closer to some hypotheses that have featured in the recent debate over
Asian crisis, we added measures of the country’s short-term indebtedness and the ratio of
domestic bank credit to GDP. Some observers have argued that, prior to the crisis,
neither bank lenders nor other markets participants appreciated the risks associated with
short-term debt. Our findings cast some doubt on this assumption: for the full set of
loans, a low ratio of international reserves to short-term debt significantly raises spreads,
while a larger share of short-term debt in country’s total outstanding bank debt has a
strong, significant, positive impact on spreads. This is a robust result that holds across
regions, with the noteworthy exception of East Asia in recent years (as we discuss
Japan and the urgency of Japanese banks’ search for yield, spreads on loans originated by Japanese banks
consistently display the smallest spreads.

14
below). Overall, however, banks appear to have attached a higher risk premium to
borrowers in countries with large amounts of short-term debt even before the factor was
highlighted in the recent crisis.10
A high ratio of domestic bank credit to GNP is a proxy for the existence of deep
domestic financial markets. Other things equal, the presence of deep markets should
reduce spreads on international bank borrowing by implying a more stable financial
environment and more local competition for foreign lenders (Levine and Zervos 1998).
While our findings confirm this presumption, the effect is small and statistically
insignificant (see Column 3 of Table 7). To further examine the relationship between
international bank spreads and domestic bank credit, we therefore added to the regression
the interaction of the growth rate with the bank credit stock/GDP ratio (and its square). It
appears that where rapid growth and high levels of bank credit are both present, spreads
are higher (Columns 4 and 5). An interpretation is that high GNP growth rates fueled by
the expansion of domestic credit (domestic credit booms) were viewed by the market
with concern. Note that with the addition of the non-linear terms, the bank credit
stock/GDP ratio now has a negative and significant sign while the squared term is
positive and significant. In other words, at low levels of financial development and low
growth rates, policy measures to improve financial intermediation bring value and reduce
the costs of external borrowing, but when they spill over into unsustainable credit booms,
they are regarded by the markets with alarm and worsen the terms of access to external
funds.

9

Relative to Edwards (1986), we find the same signs on the coefficients for loan size, loan maturity, GDP
growth, debt/GDP ratio, and the debt-service-to-export ratio but generally stronger and more robust
effects.
10
The coefficient on the interaction of short-term debt with the “relationship” variable shows that high
short-term debt lowers the value of familiarity to the market. High growth reduces the risk premium
associated with high-short term debt, although here too regional variations are important.

15
Comparing these findings with our earlier results for the bond market
(reproduced in the Appendix B), one is struck by the similarity of the determinants of
spreads. The debt variables, the growth of GDP, and the variance of export growth all
enter with the same signs and significance in equations for the full set of bank loans and
bonds. At the same time, some of the differences between the two data sets are consistent
with the notion that borrowers and lenders resort to bank intermediation to attenuate
information problems. The coefficient for private borrowers is smaller in the bank-loan
equations, as if banks are better able to overcome the special information obstacles to
lending to private entities. The effect of the country credit rating residual is smaller for
bonds than bank loans, as if characteristics that are readily observable by the credit-rating
agencies play a smaller role in this market.

V. Determinants of Loan Commitments
Since the (unobserved) characteristics of those who borrow from international
banks are likely to be different from those that do not, we also estimate the spreads
equation after correcting for selectivity bias. The procedure requires estimating a probit
equation which distinguishes borrowers from non-borrowers. To estimate the probit, we
created a set of observations for which the dependent variable took the value “zero” when
a loan commitment did not materialize. If no loan was made to a specific type of issuer
(private, public, or sovereign) in a particular country in a particular quarter, then a zero
was recorded; where a loan commitment was made, we recorded a one.

16
Results are reported in Table 8.11 We see that a rise in the U.S. treasury rate
significantly increases the probability of observing a new loan commitment. This is very
different from the finding for the bond market, where the treasury rate (for 10-year
maturity, in keeping with the tenor of bonds issued) showed a strong negative sign. In
Eichengreen and Mody (1998b), we noted that the primary effect of a rise in U.S. interest
rates was through a decline in the issuance of bonds. Some have interpreted this
phenomenon as a flight to quality: high interest rates lead bondholders to shun risky
investments; in addition, risky borrowers may prefer to wait for better market conditions.
For bank loans, in contrast, borrowers appear to be willing to pay higher rates in order to
retain access to the market, which is plausible insofar as these are floating rate
instruments (so that borrowing in periods of tight global credit conditions does not lock
them into high interest rate).
The regional variation here is of some importance. For the East Asian
subsample, the coefficient on the U.S. treasury rate, though positive, is not statistically
different from zero; and, in some specifications, a higher interest rate lowers the
probability of a bank loan commitment in East Asia, as in our analysis of the bond
market, though the effect is rarely significant. An interpretation is that East Asian
borrowers had relatively favorable access to the market (prior to the recent crisis) and
were better able to wait for global credit conditions to improve. The East Asian
coefficient contrasts with that for Latin America and South Asia, where higher interest
rates increase the probability of new loan commitments. Our spreads equation with the
correction for selectivity confirms that there is little significant impact of U.S. Treasury

distribution function with respect to a small change in the independent variable evaluated at average
values of the independent variable to facilitate interpretation.

17
rates on spreads, in contrast to the selectivity corrected results for the bond market. The
credit rating residual, the debt-to-GDP ratio, and the absence of recent debt rescheduling
appear to act as screening variables in all regions, with favorable values increasing the
probability of a loan.12 In regions other than East Asia, a higher debt-to-export ratio is
associated with a higher probability of borrowing. Strikingly, higher domestic bank
credit appears to be more strongly associated with foreign borrowing in East Asia than in
other regions. As discussed in IMF (1998), this may reflect the extensive reliance of East
Asian domestic financial systems on international credit, ironically for economies with
such high savings rates.
In light of the recent attention paid to the level of international reserves (Feldstein,
1999), we examine their role from two perspectives. The ratio of reserves to short-term
debt relates the adequacy of reserves to short-term obligations on capital account, while
the ratio of reserves to imports measures reserve adequacy for trade-related obligations.13
The two reserve ratios turn out to be important in different ways. The lower is the level
of reserves in relation to imports, the more limited is access to international loans, as if
countries in more fragile payment positions find it more difficult to borrow. While this is
a significant effect in the full sample and for each region, the differences across regions
are noteworthy. Low reserves reduce access most dramatically in the relatively closed
economies of South Asia and least in highly export-oriented East Asia. But when
reserves are viewed in relation to short-term external debts, the opposite seems to be true.

12

The exception is a recent debt rescheduling in Eastern Europe, which appears to be associated with a
higher rather than a lower probability of observing subsequent loan commitments. South Asia did not
reschedule debt in the period analyzed.
13
As Fischer (1999) notes, “countries need to set their reserve holdings on the basis of capital, as well as
current, account variables.”

18
More short-term debt does not screen out borrowers; rather, borrowers in countries with
relatively low reserves relative to short-term debt are more likely to borrow again.14
Overall, then, the results for bank borrowing are similar to those for the bond
market. The greater tendency for a heavy debt burden to ration borrowers out of the
market in Latin America than East Asia is the same as we previously obtained using an
entirely different data set for the bond market. Similarly, the ratio of debt service to
exports strongly increases the probability of observing new loan commitments and new
bond issues for Latin America but has a more modest effect in East Asia.

VI. Results with Selectivity Correction: Differences Across Regions and Over Time
Following Heckman (1979), we assume that the error terms in the two equations
are bivariate normal with standard deviations s1 and s2 and covariance s122 (where p2 =
s122/s1s2). The model can then be identified by the nonlinearity of the fitted probability in
the selection equation and by the inclusion of independent variables in the selection
equation that are not also included in the pricing equation. We estimated the system
using maximum likelihood. Table 9 reports the same pricing equation as before, this time
with the selectivity correction. The coefficients are reasonably robust to the selectivity
correction. And by the standards of the bond market, syndicated bank lending exhibits
little interregional instability.15

14

Fischer (1999) points out that the demand for reserves will increase as capital accounts become more
open. Our finding cautions that some part of the build-up in reserves may be unstable if it occurs
through increases in private external short-term obligations.
15
It will be noted, though, that the coefficients for Latin America are estimated imprecisely and that some
of the South Asian coefficients are counterintuitive (e.g., that on the growth rate). Multicollinearity
appears to be responsible for these problems. In the next section, we show that a pared down
specification produces plausible results.

19
The t-statistic of the coefficient on lambda, the Inverse Mills Ratio, summarizes
the importance of selectivity. An insignificant lambda implies that the error terms in the
probit and spreads equations are not correlated and that there is little selection bias. This
appears to be the case when the full loan set is considered: lambda is small and
statistically insignificant (the correlation between the error terms in two equations is
negative 0.06). However, evidence of selectivity is stronger when we disaggregate
regions. While the East Asian lambda is negative, that for the other regions is positive
(which explains the absence of an effect in the full sample). The normal presumption
would be a positive coefficient: entities with characteristics that make them unlikely
borrowers but who come to the market anyway will be charged higher spreads. This is
what we find for Latin American, Eastern Europe and South Asia. In East Asia,
however, borrowers who are not expected to come to the market but do so anyway are
paradoxically charged unusually low spreads.16
The bottom panel of Table 9 shows the point estimates at the regional mean
values for GDP growth, short-term debt ratio, and the bank credit stock, all of which are
entered interactively. For the full set of loans, we find the same signs on these variables
as when there are no interaction terms: faster GDP growth and a higher bank credit stock
reduce spreads, other things equal, while a higher ratio of short-term debt raises spreads.
These results have plausible explanations, as discussed earlier. For East Asia, the high
GDP growth rate has a double pay-off: not only does it have the direct effect of reducing
spreads, but it mitigates the effect of short-term debt. Thus, while East Asia has the
highest ratio of short-term debt of all regions (0.65 compared to 0.55 in Latin America

16

This may reflect hard-to-measure characteristics of these countries associated with unusually favorable
growth prospects (“Asian values”), implicit guarantees, or some other factor. Note, however, that the
statistical significance of this coefficient is marginal.

20
and 0.43 in Eastern Europe), the impact on spreads is (on the margin) smaller in Latin
America or Eastern Europe. However, the high domestic-bank-credit-to-GDP ratio (2.9
compared to 1.1 in Latin America and 0.7 in Eastern Europe) coupled with high growth
carries a penalty in terms of raising spreads.17
Considering the probit and spreads equations together allows us to interpret the
impact of variables entering both equations in terms of supply and demand. Henceforth
we use “demand” to refer to the demand by commercial banks for emerging market
exposure and the term “supply,” in keeping with our bond market terminology (“supply
of bonds”), to refer to the willingness by emerging market borrowers to contract for
international loans. The credit rating residual, the debt/GDP ratio and the debt
rescheduling variable all affect the demand by commercial banks for exposure to
emerging markets. Better credita larger credit rating residual, a smaller debt/GDP ratio,
and absence of recent debt reschedulingincreases the probability of observing a new
loan commitment while lowering the spread. This result parallels that for bonds.
For the full set of loans, the U.S. treasury rate appears to shift the demand
curvea rise in U.S. interest rates increases the probability of loans while lowering the
spreads, suggesting that when interest rates rise banks are willing to lend more at lower
spreads.18 However, regional differences are significant. For East Asia, the supply effect
seems to predominate in the market for loans (as in the market for bonds): while a rise in
the U.S. treasury rate narrows spreads, the change in the number of new loans is
statistically insignificant, suggesting that the East Asians are able to move along a

17

The signs for Latin America and Eastern Europe are the same as for the full set of loans. The withinSouth-Asia results are harder to interpret: the signs on all three variables are the opposite of those for the
full loan set.
18
Note, of course, that though the spreads decline, the overall interest rate charged to emerging markets

21
relatively inelastic commercial bank demand curve. For Latin America the supply shift
dominates as well, although it works in the opposite direction. With a rise in interest
rates, the Latin American supply curve shifts out, increasing the number of loans while
also requiring borrowers to pay higher spreads. The result for Latin American loans is
thus in contrast to that for bonds, where a rise in interest rates was associated with lower
issuance and higher spreads, indicating a fall in demand. The results suggest that, in
periods of high interest rates, high quality borrowers (traditionally from East Asia and
non-emerging-market countries) withdraw from the syndicated bank loan market
temporarily, but Latin American issuers seek to retain access, for which they are willing
to pay a higher price.
Another variable that mainly shifts the supply curve (as for bonds) is the ratio of
debt service to exports: a higher ratio typically raises the number of new loans while
increasing spreads. A variable that was not included in our earlier bond analysis, the
ratio of reserves to short-term debt, also serves to shift supply: when reserves fall in
relation to short-term debt, the number of new loans increases along with spreads. For
East Asia, the increases in stock of domestic bank credit in relationship to GDP are
associated with shifts in supply for international loans.
Finally, we consider changes over time in an attempt to see if the data throws
some light on recent events. We estimate the same model as in Table 9 for East Asian
loan commitments for different time periods. For each of these periods, we then calculate
the marginal effect of the variables of interest. (Table 10).19 Consider, for example, the
impact of the ratio of short-term bank debt, which we can relate to total bank debt or to
the level of reserves. The marginal effect is to raise the spreads in the early years, but

19

Variables whose coefficients we do not report tended to show no significant changes over time over time.

22
this effect falls after 1994 and turns negative in 1995-97, due to high growth in the region
(see the bottom panel of Table 10). An interpretation is that international bankers, while
typically cautious of high short-term debt, appear to have been taking an optimistic view
in East Asia on account of the ability of borrowers in the region to service the debt
through rapid growth. Ultimately, of course, growth expectations declined, and the high
short-term debt ratios suddenly came to be seen as unsustainable.20
These results make it easier to understand why investors should have become so
concerned about the level of short-term debt in various East Asian countries in the mid1990s. While high levels of short-term debt had been characteristic of East Asia for some
time, there was a certain knife-edge quality to their sustainability. Rapidly growing firms
value the flexibility of short-term loans, while lenders for their part are comforted by the
relationship built through rolling over the loans and by the growth prospects for servicing
them in the future. But if doubt is cast on the ability to service these loans and their
supply is summarily cut off, growth can fall sharply, further depressing confidence in the
ability to repay.

VII. Extensions and Sensitivity Analyses
We explored the robustness of our results in several ways. Our finding that bank
lending increases with a rise in the relevant U.S. treasury rates led us to examine the
influence of the yield curve. We then focussed on alternative measures of the adequacy of
reserves. Finally, for two regions, Latin America and South Asia, where the full set of
variables gave somewhat imprecise results, we examined more parsimonious models.
20

This unsustainability is also evident in the behavior over time of reserves to short-term debt. Both the
mean and the coefficient on the ratio of reserves to short-term debt move to raise spreads: reserves

23
Yield curve. An important difference between our results for bank loans and
bonds is the different response to U.S. interest rates. While bond issuance appears to fall
with the U.S. treasury rate (for ten-year maturity), bank lending appears to rise with the
treasury rate (the relevant maturity in this case being three years). The possibility that
our different results reflect the use of different interest rates led us to add a measure of
the yield curve, the difference between the ten-year and one-year treasury rates. Note
from Table 11 that the sign on the yield curve is negative and highly significant, while
the sign on the three-year treasury rate now becomes negative (though not significant).
In other words, bank lending now appears to increase when three-year treasury rates fall
or when the yield curve becomes flatter.21 This result points to the possibility that when
the yield curve is compressed, expectations of future interest rate increases are dampened,
thus increasing the propensity to borrow. The second column of Table 11 suggests that
the yield curve shifts do not significantly influence the spreads charged.
Influence of reserves on spreads. The third and fourth columns of Table 11 add
the reserves/imports ratio to the spreads equation. The reserves/imports ratio now enters
positively, the reserves/short-term debt ratio negatively. The coefficients are almost the
same in magnitude, as if when short-term debt increases to finance imports and reserves
remain unchanged, then there is no impact on spreads, but that when short-term debt rises
for reasons unrelated to a trade transaction, then it raises spreads.
Alternative Latin American and South Asian models. For both Latin America
and South Asia, the interaction terms included in the spreads equation were a source of
multicollinearity. Moreover, the correlation among the country variables is high. The
decline in relation to short-term debt and the penalty for low reserves in relation to short-term debt
increases.

24
fifth and sixth columns of Table 11 therefore present more parsimonious versions of the
Latin American and South Asian spread equations. The results are now consistent with
the pattern observed for the full sample and other regions. The coefficients for Latin
America also display greater statistical significance. For South Asia, the “wrong” sign on
GDP growth disappears and higher growth is seen to produce a statistically significant
and quantitatively large reduction in spreads. Thus, the more parsimonious specification,
by reducing multicollinearity, eliminates some of the anomalous results reported above.22

VIII. Conclusion
Our analysis of spreads charged by international banks to emerging-market
borrowers reveals a market that reacts to macroeconomic and financial information in
much the same manner as the bond market. The close correspondence between the two
sets of empirical results for capital flows intermediated by different institutions is
surprising, even striking. Institutional connections between the two markets may help to
explain this finding. Banks are sometimes the main subscribers to emerging market
bonds, while traditional bond market investors, such as insurance companies and pension
funds, increasingly participate in what are misleadingly referred to as bank syndicates.
Such convergence will only increase over time as financial mergers bring “bond” and
“bank” market participants under one corporate roof.

21

Since a rise in the three-year rate is typically accompanied by compression of the yield curve, the two
different channels of influence are not easy to distinguish.
22
An alternative approach to identifying the cases of non-lending is to consider for each country and each
quarter the different industrial sectors as issuers. We grouped the data into five industrial categories, as
described above. Thus, each country in each quarter has five potential borrowers. If a loan is observed
for any of these borrowers, a “one” is generated; otherwise a “zero” is recorded. This then becomes the
basis for the probit and the joint estimation of the probit and the spreads equation. The results remain
virtually unchanged.

25
That said, the relationship between macroeconomic and financial variables on the
one hand and pricing behavior on the other is more stable over time for bank loans than
bonds. It is tempting to interpret this in terms of the relatively long period for which
bank lending has been underway and the greater maturity of that segment of the capital
market.
The large number of small bank loans issued in the 1990s, in comparison with the
smaller number of larger bond issues, highlights the role of international bankers in
dealing with the ongoing production and trade financing requirements of small borrowers
in particular. In other words, international banks continue to play an important role in
meeting the external financing needs of their borrowers in ways that the bond market
cannot duplicate.
East Asia’s special relationship with the international banking system is evident
from the raw numbers and from the statistical relationships alike. The evidence points to
East Asia’s greater historical ability to time its entry and exit from the market. Where
borrower heterogeneity is important, East Asian borrowers are seen to benefit from their
unobserved credit characteristics.
Is there evidence of growing moral hazard affecting international bank lending?
We do see evidence of growing bullishness in the first half of the 1990s by bank lenders
to East Asia, which may reflect moral hazard. But on this issue it is fair to say that the
jury remains out.
Finally, our results point to the riskiness of high levels of domestic debt. High
short-term debt can coexist for extended periods with rapid growth but is liable to unravel
if perceptions of sustainability shift. The results thus caution once again excessive
dependence on short-term debt.

APPENDIX A: Data sources and construction of variables
Loan characteristics
The loan data set, obtained from Capital Data Loanware and further processed by
the Emerging Markets Division of the International Monetary Fund, covers the period
1991 to 1997 and includes: (a) average weighted margins plus fees (in basis points, where
one basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point) (b) the amount of the issue
(millions of US$); (c) the maturity in years; (d) whether the borrower was a sovereign,
other public sector entity, or private debtor; (e) number of borrowings by an entity during
the period under consideration; (f) currency of issue; (g) borrower’s industrial sector:
manufacturing, financial services, utility or infrastructure, other services, or government
(where government, in this case, refers to subsovereign entities and central banks, which
could not be classified in the other four industrial sectors); (h) the country and regional
identity of the borrower.
