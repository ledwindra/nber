It is argued in the theoretical model in the paper that this significant inverse relationship reflects greater discrepencies between reported and effective labor hours as grievance rates increase. Agrievance-free plant is some 1.3% more productive and up to i6.y% more profitable than when the plant operates with an average rate of grievances, so that industrial relations performance can critically influence the performance of the firm.\n\n",
