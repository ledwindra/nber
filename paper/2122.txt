How Far Has the Dollar Fallen?

ABSTRACT

The present paper introduces a new index of the real value
of the dollar relative to 80 other currencies. The individual
exchange rates are combined with weights that reflect the recent
(1984) multilateral pattern of trade. This new index confirms
that the dollar rose very sharply between January 1980 and
February 1985 and that about two-thirds of that appreciation was
reversed by July 1986. This is true for both our multilateral
and bilateral real indices. The analysis also shows that any
index that fails to adjust for differences in inflation rates
will give a very misleading impression of the dollar's evolution
in the 1980s.

How Far Has the Dollar Fallen?

Martin

Feldstein and Philippe Bacchetta

According to the Federal Reserve Board's multilateral tradeweighted index, the real value of the dollar fell 33 percent
between its peak in February 1985 and its value in October 1986.
This decline reversed 74 percent of the appreciation of 78
percent recorded between January 1980 and the February 1985 peak.
Several recent articles1 have criticized the Federal Reserve

index because it is limited to the dollar's exchange rate with
only 10 industrial currencies and because the weights are based
on trading patterns in 1972-76. The critics generally argue that
extending the currencies in the index to a wider group of
industrial countries and developing nations and using more recent

weights would show a much smaller decline in the dollar. Some
calculations, such as those by Cox (1986) or Keliner (1986), show
virtually no decline in the dollar.

The studies that conclude that the dollar's fall after
February 1985 has been very small are misleading because of two

basic problems. Most important, they compare nominal exchange
rates when it is the real exchange rate that affects

competitiveness and trade. In addition, they combine the exchange
rates of different countries using weights that reflect only
their direct trade with the United States (bilateral trade
weights) rather than their share of total world trade
(multilateral trade weights).

The failure to make any adjustment for differences in
national inflation rates is relatively unimportant when attention
is limited to the major industrial countries. Thus the Federal

Reserve Board's index for 10 industrial countries indicates that
between January 1980 and February 1985 the dollar rose 78 percent
in real terms and 85 percent in nominal terms; between February
1985 and October 1986, the index implies that the dollar fell 33

percent both in real and nominal terms. But when the group of
countries in the index is extended to include countries like
Mexico, Brazil and Argentina that experienced inflation rates

over 100 percent a year, a comparison of nominal exchange rates

is very misleading. Although the dollar actually rose some 300
percent against the Mexican peso since February 1985, this was
essentially an offset to the high inflation in Mexico. More
generally, the analysis in the present paper shows that in
nominal terms the dollar rose 23 percent against an average of
all developing country currencies between February 1985 and July
1986 while the corresponding average real exchange rate with
those countries remained unchanged.

Averaging the individual country exchange rates with weights
that reflect their trade with the United States alone (bilateral
trade weights) rather than their share of total world trade
(multilateral trade weights) ignores the influence of the
bilateral exchange rates on the competition for sales in third
countries. For example, the exchange rate between the dollar and

the German mark influences not only US-German trade but also the
abilities of the two countries to compete for sales to other

nations. using bilateral trade weights gives much more emphasis
to Canada which is relatively important in U.S. trade but which

is not very significant as a competitor of the United States in
third markets. The analysis in the present paper shows that the
bilateral trade weighted real exchange value of the dollar fell
only 16 percent between February 1985 and July 1986 while the
more appropriate multilateral value fell 24 percent.

The present paper describes the construction of a new
multilateral trade weighted general price index of the dollar's
real value relative to 80 currencies that together represent 89
percent of world trade other than that of the United States and

the Soviet Block. The study compares the behavior of this index
since 1980 with the bilateral and nominal exchange rate indices
for the same period. The analysis shows that the real value of
the dollar in July 1986 was 24 percent lower than it had been in
February 1985 but was still 24 percent higher than it had been in
January 1980.

1.

The Sample of Currencies
The index developed in the present study combines the

exchange rates between the dollar and the 80 countries for which
data on domestic prices and trade could be obtained. These 80

countries, which include 21 OECD industrial countries and 59
developing countries, represent 89.1 percent of the adjusted
total non-Soviet non-U.S. trade in 1984. More specifically, the
total of the imports and exports of these 80 countries was 89.1
percent of the 1984 non-Soviet trade as measured by the
International Monetary Fund and adjusted by excluding the trade
of the United States, Hungary, Rumania and Yugoslavia and adding
back the trade of Taiwan.
Table 1 presents the 25 leading countries in the index and
indicates the share of adjusted total non-Soviet non-U.S. trade

in 1984 for each country. Together these 25 countries represent
87.3 percent of the trade of the 80 countries in the sample.

Real Exchange Rates
There is no ideal price index for converting the nominal

exchange rates to real exchange rates. Some experts argue that
an appropriate index would include only internationally tradeable
goods. Economists at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company argue for

excluding agricultural products and fuels because trade in
agriculture is generally restricted by quotas while fuel prices

are generally set in dollars; the Morgan Guaranty real effective
exchange rate index (Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, 1986) uses

wholesale price indices for intermediate and finished
manufactured products. Pursuing this approach, it might also be
argued that, in principle, textiles and many other manufactured
products should also be excluded because they are subject to
quotas, "voluntary restraint agreements", and other quantity
restrictions. At the same time, the ideal coverage might be
broadened to include nonmanufactured products like timber and
fish that are traded without quota restrictions. In fact,
however, the data are not available to pursue such adjustments.
The present study uses the consumer price indices for
converting each of the 80 nominal exchange rates to a real
exchange rate. This use of the consumer price indices follows the
procedure of the Federal Reserve Board and has the advantage that

the resulting NBER exchange rate index is a natural extension of
the Federal Reserve's multilateral real exchange rate index

applied to a much larger set of countries with more recent trade
weights. The consumer price index also has the advantage that it
is available for a large number of countries on a relatively
timely basis.2

Multilateral Trade Weights
The real exchange rates are combined with weights that

correspond to the ratio of each country's trade with all other
2The data on consumer prices are available in the International
Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics with the

countries (the sum of its total exports and imports) to the total
1984 trade of the 80 countries in the index. When the 80
countries are classified into the 21 industrial countries in the
OECD and the 59 developing countries, the OECD countries
represent 73.2 percent of the total weight. The largest 25
weights are shown in Table 1.
The NBER exchange rate index is a geometric average of the
80 real exchange rates, a procedure adopted in virtually every

study because it makes the overall index less sensitive to wide
shifts in individual exchange rates.

This multilateral index corresponds to the procedure adopted

by the Federal Reserve. Its purpose is to reflect the potential
importance of each bilateral dollar exchange rate movement on

that country's potential competition with the United States in
all other markets as well as its direct trade with the United

States. This is a clear potential advantage over the traditional
bilateral weighting arrangement that ignores the importance of
the country's trade with other nations.

Since several of the studies that claim that the dollar has
not changed appreciably since early 1985 were based on a
bilateral index, we also present a bilateral index for the 80

countries. In this index, the exchange rates are combined with
weights that correspond to the ratio of each country's trade with
the United States (the sum of its exports to and imports from the
United States) to the total trade between the United States and
the 80 countries. In the bilateral index, the OECD countries
6

represent 65.0 percent of the total weight.3

In principle the ideal weights would reflect the sensitivity
of trade to the changes in individual bilateral exchange rates.
Although the multilateral weights may be a better general
approximation than bilateral weights, the multilateral index may
give too much weight to intra-European trade that is not

particularly sensitive to the value of the dollar. Similarly, a
bilateral index weighted by U.S. imports from each country might
be a better index for measuring the competitiveness of U.S.
products vis-a-vis imports.

The Rise and Fall of the Dollar
Table 2 summarizes the rise and fall of the real

multilateral trade weighted value of the dollar since January
1980 as well as the behavior of three other indices of the

dollar's movements. The first column of the table shows the
period of the rising dollar from January 1980 through February

1985. The second column shows the dollar's decline from February
1985 through July 1986, the most recent month for which price

data were generally available. The final column shows the overall
movement between January 1980 and July 1986.

The real multilateral value of the dollar rose 62.5 percent
from January 1980 through February 1985. This reflects a 74.1

percent rise against the currencies of the industrial OECD
3The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company's widely cited traditional
exchange rate index uses bilateral trade weights. The new Morgan
Guaranty broad index is a hybrid of multilateral and bilateral
procedures.

countries and a 33.7 percent rise against the currencies of the
59 less developed countries in the index. Recall that the OECD
countries represented 73.2 percent of the total weight in the
overall index.

From February 1985 through July 1986 the real value of the
dollar fell 31.3 percent against the currencies of the OECD
countries but remained unchanged (rose 0.3 percent) against the

currencies of the 59 developing countries. The overall weighted
average therefore shows that the total real value of the dollar
declined 23.9 percent.

The third column shows that, as of July 1986, the real value
of the dollar was still 23.6 percent above its value in January
1980. This reflects a net appreciation of 19.7 percent against

the OECD currencies and 34.1 percent against the currencies of
the developing countries.
5.

A Comparison of Four Indices
The three other measures of the dollar's movements presented

in Table 2 show very different patterns from the behavior of the
dollar's real multilateral trade-weighted value. All four

measures are also compared in figure 1 (with the indices all
normalized to 100 in January 1980).

Simply shifting from multilateral to bilateral weights
reduces the calculated real appreciation between 1980 and 1985

from 63 percent to 38 percent. This reflects a sharp fall in the
appreciation relative to the other OECD countries (largely
because of the greatly increased weight on Canada) and some
8

increase in the weight given to the developing countries. The
estimated decline after February 1985 is also reduced, from 24
percent to 16 percent. As a result, the net appreciation from
January 1980 through July 1986 is reduced from 24 percent to 16

percent. It should be noted, however, that the bilateral and
multilateral real indices both imply that by July 1986 the
decline had reversed slightly more than 60 percent of the

previous rise. Figure 1 shows that the combination of inflation
adjustment and bilateral weights produces the index that varied
the least over the period.

At the opposite extreme is the multilateral nominal exchange
rate. Because U.S. inflation was slightly less than the inflation
in the other OECD countries in the period from January 1980

through February 1985, the dollar's nominal value rose more than
its real value. The difference however is relatively small: a 74
percent rise in the real value of the dollar and an 85 percent
rise in the nominal value of the dollar. For the developing

countries, however, the difference is much greater. The dollar's
real appreciation was only 34 percent but the nominal

appreciation during the same period was 171 percent. This simply
underlines the inappropriateness of using nominal exchange rates.
The result is similar during the period since February 1985.

There is virtually no difference between the nominal and real
fall in the dollar relative to the currencies of the other
industrial countries but with respect to the developing countries
the dollar's real value remained unchanged while its nominal

value rose 23 percent. Figure 1 shows that the rise in the
multilateral nominal index was the greatest of all four indices.
The final portion of the table corresponds to the bilateral
weighted nominal exchange rates. This is conceptually the same as
the indices constructed by Cox (1986) and Keliner (1986) although
the actual figures differ because of differences in the countries
included. The OECD subindex is very similar to the bilateral real
index, understating both the rise and the fall in the dollar's
value relative to the multilateral weighted indices. But the
primary distortion comes from including the 362 percent nominal
appreciation of the dollar relative to the currencies of the
developing countries since 1980 instead of the 34 percent real

appreciation. As figure 1 shows, this strong upward trend in the
dollar's nominal exchange rate relative to the currencies of the
very inflationary developing countries had the effect of implying
a very sharp rise in the dollar's value through 1985 and then
virtually no decline. It is clear from table 2 that this is a
specious result that reflects the high average rate of inflation
in the developing countries.

that the dollar rose very sharply between January 1980 and
February 1985 and that about two-thirds of that appreciation was

reversed by July 1986. This is true for both our multilateral

and bilateral real indices. The analysis also shows that any

will give a very misleading impression of the dollar's evolution
in the 1980s.
