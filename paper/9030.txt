Current Accounts in the Long and Short Run

NBER Working Paper No. 9030

ABSTRACT
Faced with income fluctuations, countries smooth their consumption by raising savings when
income is high, and vice versa. How much of these savings do countries invest at home and abroad? In
other words, what are the effects of fluctuations in savings on domestic investment and the current
account? In the long run, we find that countries invest the marginal unit of savings in domestic and
foreign assets in the same proportions as in their initial portfolio, so that the latter is remarkably stable.
In the short run, we find that countries invest the marginal unit of savings mostly in foreign assets, and
only gradually do they rebalance their portfolio back to its original composition. This means that countries
not only try to smooth consumption, but also domestic investment. To achieve this, they use foreign assets
as a buffer stock.

Countries are subject to transitory income shocks such as changes in the terms
of trade, fluctuations in production, policy reforms, natural disasters, and many others.
There is ample evidence that countries use their assets to buffer or smooth the effects
of these shocks on consumption, raising savings when income is high and vice versa.1
The main goal of this paper is to improve our understanding of the combination of
assets that countries use for this purpose. In particular, we ask: how do countries
allocate the marginal unit of savings between domestic and foreign assets? Or,
equivalently, what are the effects of fluctuations in savings on domestic investment and
the current account? 2

The traditional view is that countries invest the marginal unit of savings in
foreign assets. Underlying this view are the assumptions that investment risk is weak
and diminishing returns are strong. The first assumption ensures that countries invest
their savings only in those assets that offer the highest expected return. The second
assumption implies that investing any fraction of the marginal unit of savings in
domestic capital would lower its expected return below that of foreign assets. Hence
the marginal unit of savings is invested in foreign assets, justifying the traditional rule
that fluctuations in savings lead to fluctuations in the current account of roughly the
same magnitude. While theoretically coherent, this rule has been consistently rejected
by the data. The top panel of Figure 1 shows pooled annual observations of the current
account and savings for 21 OECD countries over the past 30 years. A regression of the
current account on savings delivers a slope coefficient that is positive but much lower
than one. This is nothing but the famous result of Feldstein and Horioka [1980] that
fluctuations in savings lead to parallel fluctuations in investment, with only minor effects
on the current account.

For evidence on consumption-smoothing, see Deaton [1991] who writes that “consumption is less volatile
than income, it fluctuates less about its trend, the amplitude of its business cycle variation is less, and the
variance of its growth rate is less than the variance of the growth rate of income” p.133-34.
2
Why do countries use assets to smooth consumption rather than simply buy insurance abroad? Implicit in
this paragraph and basically in all that follows is the assumption that countries are unable or unwilling to
sell their idiosyncratic risk. This assumption is a central tenet of the intertemporal approach to the current
account (See Obstfeld and Rogoff [1995]), and it is widely thought to provide an accurate description of

3

In an earlier paper, we proposed a new view that countries invest the marginal
unit of savings as the average one (Kraay and Ventura [2000]). This is what one should
expect if, in contrast to the traditional view, investment risk is strong and diminishing
returns are weak. The first assumption implies that countries are unwilling to change
the composition of their portfolios, unless shocks have large effects on the distribution
of asset returns. The second assumption ensures that the distribution of asset returns
is unaffected by the way countries invest the marginal unit of savings. Hence, the
marginal unit of savings is invested as the average one, leading to the new rule that
fluctuations in savings lead to fluctuations in the current account that are equal to
savings times the share of foreign assets in the country portfolio. This rule not only is
theoretically coherent, but it also provides a surprisingly good description of the data.
The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows that a simple regression of the current account on
the interaction between savings and the share of foreign assets delivers a slope
coefficient close to one and a zero intercept. Moreover, this interaction term by itself
explains around thirty percent of the observed variation in the current account.3

Hidden in the bottom panel of Figure 1 there is a vast difference between the
predictive power of the new rule in the long and the short run. Figure 2 illustrates this
point. In the top panel, we have plotted the average current account over a thirty-year
period against the average of savings time the share of foreign assets during the same
period. The new rule explains about 85 percent of the long run or average crosscountry differences in current accounts. In the bottom panel, we have plotted the
(demeaned) current account for each country and year against the (demeaned)
interaction of savings and the initial share of foreign assets in wealth for the same
country and year. The new rule explains basically none of the year-to-year within-

reality. The question of why this is so is one of the most intriguing puzzles in international finance. See
Lewis [1999] for a survey of the literature on this topic.
3
Since foreign assets constitute a small fraction of observed country portfolios, this view implies that
fluctuations in savings should mostly lead to parallel fluctuations in investment, and is therefore consistent
with the Feldstein-Horioka finding. What we found most surprising about this view in our earlier paper is
that it has sharply different implications for the current account response to an increase in savings in
debtor and creditor countries. Since debtors by definition hold more than their wealth in domestic capital,
they invest at home more than the increase in savings, resulting in a current account deficit. In contrast,
creditor countries invest at home less than the increase in savings, resulting in a current account surplus.

country differences in current accounts. The contrast between the two panels indicates
a discrepancy between the long and the short run behavior of the current account.4

Is the short-run relationship between savings and the current account just noise
or are there clear patterns behind this cloud of points? How do we reconcile the
apparently haphazard behavior of the current account in the short run with its neat
behavior in the long run? The main contribution of this paper, we think, is to provide
clear answers to these questions. To do this, it is useful to start by pointing out that the
new rule embodies the view that the current account primarily reflects portfolio growth,
i.e. changes in the size of the country portfolio without systematic changes in its
composition. The empirical success of the new rule in the top panel of Figure 2 simply
reflects the observation that the composition of country portfolios has been remarkably
stable in the long run. This is shown in Figure 3. If we want to understand why the new
rule performs so poorly in the bottom panel of Figure 2, we must explain how and why
in the short run increases in savings lead mostly to portfolio rebalancing, i.e. systematic
changes in the composition of the country portfolio. If in addition we want to reconcile
the two panels of Figure 2, we must go further and also explain why this short-run
portfolio rebalancing is undone in the long run.

Our hypothesis is that the pattern of portfolio rebalancing is consistent with the
view that adjustment costs to investment are important. If this is the case, an increase
in savings that raises investment reduces the expected return to capital and induces
countries to rebalance their portfolios towards foreign assets. Under these conditions,
the short-run current account surplus is larger than the one predicted by the new rule.
Once savings returns to normal, investment declines, adjustment costs disappear and
the country portfolio returns gradually to its original composition. Throughout this
adjustment process, the current account surplus is smaller than the one predicted by

4

We also noted this discrepancy in our earlier paper, although it was much less pronounced in the smaller
sample of 13 countries and 23 years (1973-1995) that we used there. Here, we have been able to extend
our sample to 21 countries and up to 32 years per country (1966-1997). All the results obtained in the
previous paper are confirmed and, to some extent, reinforced when we use the larger sample.

5

the new rule. In the long run, the shock does not affect the composition of the country
portfolio and the new rule applies.

With this theoretical picture at hand, we go back to the data to search for
patterns in the discrepancies between the observed current account and what the new
rule would predict. When we do this, the picture that comes out from the data turns out
to be clear and unambiguous: on impact, countries rebalance their portfolios towards
foreign assets and the new rule systematically under-predicts the short-run effects of
increases in savings on the current account. In the years that follow, countries
rebalance their portfolios back towards their original composition. During this period,
the new rule systematically over-predicts the current account. We find that the whole
adjustment process lasts about five years. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the
view that adjustment costs to investment are important and, to avoid paying them,
countries use foreign assets as a buffer stock to smooth fluctuations in investment.

The theory presented here can also reconcile two apparently contradictory
observations about the relationship between the current account and investment. On
the one hand, the long run or cross-sectional correlation between investment and the
current account is weak (Penati and Dooley [1984], Tesar [1991]). On the other hand,
the short run or time-series correlation between investment and the current account is
consistently negative (Glick and Rogoff [1995]). The theory presented here predicts
that in the long run, portfolio rebalancing is small and the correlation between the
current account and investment should be positive in creditor countries and negative in
debtor ones. We show that the data is consistent with this prediction and that the weak
cross-sectional correlation is the result of pooling data from debtor and creditor
countries. The theory also predicts that in the short run portfolio rebalancing is
important and this introduces a source of negative correlation between the current
account and investment. This is true in all countries, regardless of whether they are
debtors or creditors. We present a simple decomposition of the cross-sectional and
time-series correlations between the current account and investment that illustrates this
point.

The paper is organized as follows: Section I presents a stylized model that
encapsulates the main elements of our portfolio-based theory of the current account.
Section II uses the model to study how countries react to income shocks. Section III
examines the empirical evidence and interprets it from the vantage point of the theory.
Section IV investigates the relationship between investment and the current account.
Section V concludes.

I. An Intertemporal Model of the Current Account
In this section, we present a stylized model of how the current account
responds to transitory income shocks. Since we stop short of modeling the world
equilibrium and focus instead on a small open economy, these shocks should be
interpreted as country-specific or idiosyncratic risk. Following the tradition of the
intertemporal approach, we simply assume that countries are unable or unwilling to sell
this risk in international markets. In particular, we adopt the starkest form of this view
by assuming that the only asset that is traded internationally is a non-contingent bond.5

The model captures what we think are the essential elements of a portfoliobased theory of the current account. This theory is built around the concept of country
portfolio and a simple decomposition of the current account that relies on this concept.
By the country portfolio, we refer to the sum of all productive assets located within the
country plus its net foreign asset position. The latter consist of the sum of all claims on
domestic assets held by foreigners minus the sum of all claims on foreign assets held
by domestic residents. In our simple model, the only productive asset located within the
country is the stock of capital, and the net foreign asset position is simply the stock of
5

The intertemporal approach was developed by Sachs [1981, 1982], Obstfeld [1982], Dornbusch [1983],
Svensson and Razin [1983], Persson and Svensson [1985], and Matsuyama [1987], among others.
Obstfeld and Rogoff [1995] survey this research.

non-contingent bonds owned by the country. By the composition of the country
portfolio, we refer to the share of the net foreign asset position in it. To interpret the
evolution of the current account it is useful to break it down into two components or
pieces: changes in the size of the country portfolio, which we call portfolio growth; and
changes in the composition of the country portfolio, or portfolio rebalancing.6

We study a small country populated by a continuum of identical consumers.
There is a single good that can be used for consumption and investment. Consumers
have access to two investment opportunities: foreign loans and domestic capital. The
instantaneous interest rate on foreign loans is ρ. To produce one unit of capital one unit
of the single good is required. Since capital is reversible and does not depreciate, its
price is equal to one and its return is equal to the flow of production minus operating
costs. The flow of production generated by one unit of capital is π⋅dt+σ⋅dω; where π and
σ are non-negative constants; and ω is a Wiener processes, i.e. its changes are
normally distributed with E[dω]=0 and E[dω2]=dt. That is, the flow of production is
normally distributed with instantaneous mean π and instantaneous variance σ. The
operating costs, α, are assumed to be proportional to the aggregate investment rate:

(1)

1 dk
α = λ⋅ ⋅
k dt

(λ≥0)

where k is the aggregate stock of capital at the beginning of the period. Since capital
does not depreciate, this is also the stock of capital that was used in production in the
previous period. Note that we are treating the relationship between operating costs and
investment as a congestion effect or negative externality. One set of assumptions that
justifies this relationship would be that investment requires a public input that costs λ
per unit of investment and the government finances this input by raising a tax α on
capital. There might be alternative and more compelling sets of assumptions that

Implicit in this decomposition is the assumption that asset price revaluations are small. This might be a
poor assumption in some episodes. See Ventura [2001] for an example that shows this.

deliver this relationship. The reason we adopt it here is simply because it provides a
tractable and effective way to capture the notion of adjustment costs to investment.7

The representative consumer values consumption sequences with these
preferences:

∫

E ln c ⋅ e −δ⋅t ⋅ dt

(δ>0)

0

Given our assumptions about the flow of production and the operating costs,
the return to capital is ( π − α ) ⋅ dt + σ ⋅ dω ; and the representative consumer’s budget
constraint can be written as follows:

(3)

da = [(( π − α ) ⋅ (1 − x ) + ρ ⋅ x ) ⋅ a − c ] ⋅ dt + (1 − x ) ⋅ a ⋅ σ ⋅ dω

where c, a and x denote consumption, wealth and the share of foreign loans in the
portfolio of the representative consumer. The budget constraint illustrates the standard
risk-return trade-off underlying investment decisions. Each extra unit of wealth invested
in domestic capital rather than foreign loans increases the expected return to wealth by
π-α, at the cost of raising the variance of this return by σ2. Finally, we assume that it is
not possible to short-sell the capital stock, i.e. x≤1.

Solving the representative consumer problem, we find the optimal consumption
and portfolio decisions:8

(4)

c = δ⋅a

7

The q-theory postulates that investment raises the price of investment goods relative to consumption
goods, leaving the productivity of capital constant. We instead postulate that investment lowers the
productivity of capital, leaving the relative price of investment and consumption goods constant. It is likely
that in real economies, both sorts of adjustment costs to investment are important. See Lucas [1967] for an
early model that considers both types of adjustment costs; and Caballero [1997] and Dixit and Pyndick
[1994] for two excellent expositions of existing models of adjustment costs of investment.

Merton [1971] solved this problem first. See also the appendix in Kraay and Ventura [2000].

When deciding their consumption, consumers behave as in the permanentincome theory of Friedman. Equation (4) shows that consumption is a fixed fraction of
wealth and is independent of the expected return and volatility of available assets.
When deciding their portfolio, consumers behave as in the mean-variance theory of
Markowitz and Tobin. Equation (5) shows that the shares of each asset in the portfolio
depend only on the mean and variance of the different assets and not on the level of
wealth. The kink in the demand for foreign assets is the result of the short-sale
constraint on domestic capital, i.e. x≤1.

In equilibrium, the demand and supply of capital must be equal and this implies
that:

(6)

(1 − x ) ⋅ a = k + dk

The left hand side of Equation (6) is the demand for capital. Since we have
assumed that only domestic consumers hold domestic capital, this demand is equal to
the share of their wealth that these consumers want to hold in domestic capital, times
wealth. The right hand side of Equation (6) is the supply of capital, and consists of the
capital stock at the beginning of the period plus the investment made during the period.

This completes the description of the model. There are two state variables: k
and a; and one shock: dω. The “new rule” model of our previous paper obtains as the
limiting case in which λ→0. In this case, there are no adjustment costs to investment
and the only state variable is the level of wealth. Assume that π>ρ+λ⋅(ρ-δ). This
parameter restriction ensures that the economy is productive enough so that the short-

10

selling constraint on capital is never binding. Then, it is straightforward to use
Equations (1)-(6) to obtain the dynamics for the capital stock and wealth:9

Equations (7)-(8) provide the law of motion of the system from any given initial
condition and sequence of shocks. Our next goal is to use this dynamical system to
study how the current account responds to income shocks.

II. Portfolio Growth and Portfolio Rebalancing
To illustrate the model’s implications, we analyze the behavior of savings,
investment and the current account after a transitory income shock. To do this, it is
useful first to establish some notation. Let S and CA be savings and the current
account both as a share of wealth, i.e. S =

1 da
1 d( x ⋅ a )
⋅
and CA = ⋅
. It follows that,

along any particular sample path that we consider, the current account can be written
as follows:

CA = x ⋅ S +

Equation (9) shows that it is possible to interpret the current account as the sum
of two terms. The first one measures the change in the stock of foreign assets that

would keep constant the composition of the country portfolio and this is what we refer
to as portfolio growth. The second term measures the change in the composition of the
country portfolio and this is what we refer to as portfolio rebalancing.

To develop intuitions about the interplay between these two components of the
current account, we present next a series of examples. In all of them, we assume the
following sample path for the production shock:

(10)

0
dω 
= ε ⋅ σ −1
dt 
0

t ∈ ( −∞, T1)
t ∈ [T1, T2 )
t ∈ [T2 , ∞ )

(ε>0)

That is, the country experiences a sequence of unexpected production shocks
equal to ε⋅dt times the capital stock for a finite period and zero afterwards. We refer to
the period [T1,T2) as the shock period and to (-∞,T1) and [T2,∞) as the pre- and postshock periods, respectively.

Figure 4 shows the behavior of the foreign asset position along this sample
path. Regardless of the initial condition, during the pre-shock period the share of

simulation behind Figure 4 assumes that this value has been reached by t=0. During
the shock period the share of foreign assets increases steadily, albeit at a declining
rate. The magnitude of this increase depends on λ. High values of λ imply that the
effects of increased investment on operating costs are large and provide a strong
inducement for investors to rebalance their portfolios towards foreign assets. During
the post-shock period, investment and operating costs decline. As a result, the share of
foreign assets slowly returns to its pre-shock level. We next study the implications of
this behavior of the share of foreign assets for the current account.

12

Consider first the case in which adjustment costs to investment are negligible,
i.e. λ→0. Figure 4 shows that in this case the share of foreign assets is constant
throughout. As a result, there is no portfolio rebalancing, i.e.

dx
= 0 ; and the current
dt

account is equal to portfolio growth; i.e. CA = x ⋅ S . This is the “new rule” model that we
analyzed in our previous paper, and its implications for a creditor and a debtor country
are depicted in Figure 5. The top panel shows a creditor country, i.e. x*>0, while the
bottom panel shows a debtor country, i.e. x*<1. Both countries raise their savings
during the shock period as a result of the standard “consumption-smoothing” motive.
Both countries also invest these marginal savings in domestic capital and foreign loans
in the same proportions as their average portfolio. Since the foreign asset share is
small in absolute value, we find that in both countries the increase in investment is of
the same order of magnitude as the increase in saving. But it is not exactly the same,
and this leads to different current account responses in debtor and creditor countries.
In the creditor country investment increases somewhat less than savings and the
current account registers a surplus. In the debtor country investment increases
somewhat more than savings and the current account registers a deficit. This is the
main result of our previous paper.

Consider next the case in which adjustment costs to investment are no longer
negligible, i.e. λ>0. Figure 6 shows the case of a country that is neither a debtor nor a
creditor. By choosing the case x*=0, we know that in the absence of adjustment costs,
the current account would be zero before, during and after the shock. Figure 6 shows
the behavior of savings, investment and the current account in this case. The country
raises its savings during the shock period for the same “consumption-smoothing”
motive as before. But adjustment costs now discourage large swings in investment,
and this affects how these savings are distributed between domestic capital and
foreign loans.

During the shock period, the country uses most of its increase in savings to
purchase foreign loans, while investment increases only gradually. Consumers

13

rebalance their portfolios towards foreign assets because the increase in investment
raises operating costs and this lowers the expected return to domestic capital. The
portfolio-rebalancing component of the current account is positive and, as a result, the
new rule under-predicts the current account surplus in the short run. In the post-shock
period investment falls slowly, but remains higher than normal for a while. Since
productivity has returned to its pre-shock level, savings return to normal and the
higher-than-normal investment is now financed by a sale of foreign loans. Consumers
rebalance their portfolios back towards their original composition because the decline
in investment lowers operating costs and this raises the expected return to domestic
capital. The portfolio-rebalancing component of the current account is therefore
negative and, as a result, the new rule over-predicts the current account surplus in the
medium run. As time passes, the country portfolio returns to its original composition
and the new rule applies again in the long run.

This example clearly shows the role of foreign loans as a buffer stock to smooth
the fluctuations in investment. Without access to foreign loans, countries would be
forced not only to invest all of their savings at home but also to do so
contemporaneously. Access to foreign loans permits countries a to spread their
domestic investment over time and, in this way, avoid paying high adjustment costs. To
do this, countries temporarily place their savings in foreign loans and slowly convert
them into domestic investment.

It is possible to design more complicated examples in which the current account
exhibits richer dynamics. For instance, Figure 7 shows the case of positive adjustment
costs in a creditor and a debtor country. One can interpret these examples as a
combination of portfolio growth and portfolio rebalancing along the lines of the
explanations of Figures 5 and 6. The theory developed here therefore equips us with a
clear picture of the factors that determine how the current account reacts to increases
in savings. The next step is to go back to actual data and attempt to interpret it from the
vantage point of the theory.

14

III. The Process of Current Account Adjustment
In the introduction, we argued that in the long run most of the variation in
current accounts in OECD countries is due to portfolio growth effects, while in the short
run, current account fluctuations primarily reflect changes in the composition of country
portfolios or portfolio rebalancing. We made this point based on the observation that
the simple interaction of a country’s foreign asset share with its saving, averaged over
the past thirty years, proved to be a very good predictor of the country’s average
current account. However, the same interaction using annual data proved to be a very
poor predictor of year-to-year fluctuations in current accounts. This was shown in the
two panels of Figure 2.10

The theory presented above has the potential to explain these observations. In
the presence of adjustment costs to investment, the theory predicts that in the shortrun countries react to transitory income shocks by raising savings and rebalancing their
portfolios towards foreign assets. If these costs are sufficiently strong, the theory can
therefore explain why the short run variation in the current account is dominated by
portfolio rebalancing, and not portfolio growth. The theory also predicts that in the
aftermath of the shock countries gradually rebalance their portfolios back to their
original composition. Therefore the theory can also explain why the long-run variation
in the current account is dominated by portfolio growth, and not portfolio rebalancing.

The theory also has very clear predictions for the patterns of portfolio
rebalancing that we should observe in the data. The new rule or portfolio growth
10

Of course, one could argue that this discrepancy in the “between” and “within” results is simply due to
much greater measurement error in the within-country variation in current accounts and portfolio growth
than in the between-country variation. While measurement error is certainly present, we clearly do not
think it is the whole story. One way to see this is to notice that (i) measurement error in the RHS variable
in our regression will bias the slope coefficient downward by a factor equal to the signal-to-noise ratio, and
2
(ii) measurement error in both the LHS and RHS variables will bias the R coefficient by a factor equal to
the product of the signal-to-noise ratios in the two variables. Since we observe a slope coefficient of one2
half and an R coefficient that falls from 0.6 in the “between” regression to 0.03 in the within regression,
this implies a signal to noise ratio of only 0.5 in the RHS variable and 0.1 in the LHS variable. While there
are clearly various measurement issues in our data, we find it implausible that the data is as noisy as this
calculation would suggest.

component of the current account under-predicts the actual current account during the
shock period as countries rebalance their portfolios towards foreign assets, while the
new rule over-predicts the current account after the shock as countries rebalance their
portfolios back towards its original composition. In other words, a contemporaneous
increase in savings should be associated with a positive portfolio-rebalancing
component of the current account, while past increases in savings should be
associated with negative values in the same component. Moreover, for the new rule to
apply in the long run, these positive and negative components should be roughly of the
same magnitude. In this section, we show that the data is consistent with these
predictions.

We begin by decomposing observed current accounts into portfolio growth and
portfolio rebalancing components. As in the theory, let xct denote the share of foreign
assets in the portfolio of country c at the beginning of period t, and let Sct and CAct
denote gross national saving and the current account balance as a fraction of GDP
during period t. We measure the portfolio-growth component of the current account as
PGct ≡ x ct ⋅ Sct , i.e. the net purchases of foreign assets that would be observed during

period t if a country were to distribute its saving between domestic and foreign assets
in the same proportion as its existing portfolio at the beginning of the period. We
measure the portfolio-rebalancing component of the current account residually as the
difference between the actual current account and the portfolio-growth component, i.e.
PRct ≡ CA ct − x ct ⋅ Sct .

To implement this decomposition, we require data on current accounts, saving
and the share of foreign assets in country portfolios. We obtain annual data on current
accounts in current US dollars from the International Monetary Fund’s International
Financial Statistics. We measure gross national saving as the sum of the current
account and gross domestic investment in current US dollars, and express both as a
fraction of GDP in current US dollars, obtaining investment and GDP from the World
Bank’s World Development Indicators. We obtain data on the share of foreign assets
in wealth from Kraay, Loayza, Servén and Ventura (2000). We restrict attention to the

16

set of 21 industrial countries for which at least 20 annual observations on this variable
are available over the period 1966-1997 covered by this dataset.

With data on saving and the portfolio-rebalancing component of the current
account in hand, we estimate a series of dynamic linear regressions of the form:

(11)

PR ct = α c +

p

∑φ
v =1

cv

⋅ PR c,t − v +

q

∑γ
v =0

cv

′
⋅ S c,t − v + β c Z ct + u ct

where PRct and Sct are the portfolio-rebalancing component of the current account and
saving as described above; Zct is a vector of control variables, and uct is a well-behaved
error term. We then use the point estimates of the coefficients to retrieve the implied
impulse response function of portfolio rebalancing in period t+k to an increase in saving
in period t, i.e.

∂PR c,t +k
∂S ct

. These impulse responses provide us with a picture of how

countries change the composition of their portfolios following an increase in saving.
The results of four such regressions are summarized in Table 1. The top panel of
Table 1 reports the estimated coefficients, while the bottom panel reports the
corresponding impulse response functions using the 21-country sample of annual
observations. The estimated impulse response functions are also plotted in the four
panels of Figure 8.

We begin by assuming that all of the slope coefficients are the same across
countries. In our simplest specification, we also set p=0 and introduce 5 lags of
saving.11 The results of this specification are reported in the first column of Table 1.
In this case, the impulse response function simply consists of the estimated coefficients
on current and lagged saving. We find a strong positive contemporaneous correlation
between saving and the current account. The point estimate of 0.6 can be interpreted
as the fraction of an increase in saving that, on impact, would be invested in foreign

17

assets by a country with zero initial foreign assets. This fraction would be slightly
higher (lower) in creditor (debtor) countries because of the portfolio-growth component.
Since the latter measures the current account balance that would keep the composition
of their portfolios constant following an increase in saving, it is by construction positive
in creditor countries and negative in debtor ones.

The subsequent lags of saving all enter with negative coefficients that are
decreasing in absolute value and, with the exception of the first lag, are not significantly
different from zero. These coefficients can be interpreted as the fraction of the initial
increase in saving that is reallocated back towards domestic assets in each of the
subsequent five years. Interestingly, the sum of the coefficients on lagged saving is –
0.09 which is insignificantly different from zero. This suggests that the initial shift
toward foreign assets is largely undone in the next five years, with the bulk of the
readjustment occurring in the first year following the increase in saving. This pattern is
consistent with the predictions of the theory.

The rest of Table 1 reports a variety of robustness checks on this basic result.
We begin by introducing lagged values of the portfolio-rebalancing component of the
current account, and find that the first and second lags are strongly significant, while
third (and higher) lags are not. 12 Although this slightly alters the point estimates of the
coefficients on current and lagged saving, we find that the shape of impulse response
function is very similar to that reported in the first regression. The main difference is
that the initial shift toward foreign assets is slightly smaller than before, at 50 percent of
the increase in saving.
11

In unreported results, we find that fifth and higher lags of saving are insignificantly different from zero in
most specifications, and adding higher lags has little effect on the point estimates of the coefficients on the
first five lags.
12
We are assuming here that the time dimension of our panel is sufficiently large that we can obtain
consistent estimates of the coefficients on the lagged dependent variable in the presence of fixed effects
relying on large-T asymptotics. Remember also that saving is constructed as investment plus the current
account, and the latter is highly correlated with the dependent variable in Equation (11). To the extent that
the portfolio-rebalancing component of the current account is measured with errors that are persistent over
time, this could introduce a correlation between the residuals and current and lagged saving. In the
specifications with lags of the dependent variable, we test for and do not reject the null of no serial
dependence in the residuals, and so we can rule out this potential source of bias in our estimated impulse
responses.

18

In the next column we augment the specification of the previous column with
several additional control variables. To the extent that there are other shocks to returns
that change the desired composition of country portfolios, and to the extent that these
are correlated with saving, this will bias our results in directions which depend on the
signs of these correlations. For example, if there are global shocks which raise saving
and investment in all countries (such as changes in world interest rates), we will be
underestimating the size of the initial shift toward foreign assets when saving
increases. Similarly, if in countries and years in which saving is high, factors that
increase the desired rate of investment (such as population or productivity growth), we
may again be underestimating the shift toward foreign assets. To control for these
factors, we introduce year dummies to capture global shocks, population growth, and
Solow residuals as a proxy for productivity growth.13 The third column of Table 1
reports the results of this augmented regression. Population growth and Solow
residuals enter significantly with the expected negative signs, and we find a larger shift
toward foreign assets than before, with 75 percent of the initial increase in saving
allocated toward foreign assets. However, the subsequent pattern of adjustment is the
same as before, with the initial shift toward foreign assets being reversed in next few
years.

In the final column, we relax the assumption that the slope coefficients in
Equation (11) are the same across countries, and instead estimate this equation
separately for each country. Because of the fairly short time-series available for each
country, we adopt a more parsimonious lag structure, introducing only two lags of the
dependent variable and of saving, as well as population growth and Solow residuals.
We report the average and standard deviation across countries of the estimated
coefficients in the last column of Table 1.14 Not surprisingly, we find that the country13

We construct Solow residuals as the growth in GDP at constant prices less growth in employment times
the period average share of labour in GDP, drawing the latter two variables from the OECD Labour Force
Statistics and National Accounts.
14
In the presence of parameter heterogeneity across countries, the pooled estimates reported in the
previous two columns will not deliver consistent estimates of average (across countries) of these
parameters when there is a lagged dependent variable (Pesaran and Smith (1995)). However, the
average across countries of the estimated coefficients will provide a consistent estimate of the average

19

by-country parameters are much less precisely estimated, and the dispersion across
countries in the point estimates is large. Nevertheless, we find results that are
qualitatively and quantitatively quite similar to those in the previous columns. On
average, the fraction of an increase in saving that is allocated to foreign assets is 0.7,
and this initial shift toward foreign assets is quickly undone in subsequent periods.

One drawback of the annual data on which we have relied so far is that it is not
informative about the intra-year dynamics of saving and the current account. For 12 of
the countries in our sample, we were able to obtain quarterly observations on the
current account, investment and GDP beginning in 1980 or earlier from the
International Financial Statistics and the OECD Quarterly National Accounts. For these
countries, we linearly interpolate the annual data on the foreign asset share and use it
to construct quarterly portfolio growth and rebalancing components. We then reestimate Equation (11) using quarterly data, introducing eight lags of the portfolio
rebalancing component of the current account, and eight lags of saving. We do not
have quarterly data on population or employment growth required to introduce the
same control variables as in the previous regressions with annual data (Regressions 3
and 4 in Table 1). We therefore include only a set of period dummies and real GDP
growth as controls.

As before, we summarize the results of these country-by-country regressions
by computing the mean and standard deviation across countries of the estimated
impulse responses. As shown in the top panel of Figure 9, we find that on impact, just
over 60 percent of an increase in saving that lasts one quarter is invested abroad.
Beginning immediately in the next quarter, this initial shift toward foreign assets begins
to be reversed as countries run current account deficits. If we consider a shock to
saving that lasts four quarters, the pattern that emerges is very similar to that we saw
in the annual data. This is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 9. During the shock
period, countries run positive but declining current account surpluses as they use

response. We find results that are quantitatively quite similar across all specifications despite this potential
source of bias in the estimates which impose parameter homogeneity across countries.

20

foreign assets as a buffer stock to smooth investment. In subsequent years, countries
run current account deficits in order to restore their original pre-shock portfolios.

To sum up, while portfolio growth explains much of the long-run variation in
current accounts, portfolio rebalancing dominates in the short run. In all of our
specifications, we find that the portfolio-rebalancing component of the current account
follows a remarkably clear pattern. On impact, up to three-quarters of a shock to saving
is invested abroad as countries use foreign assets as a buffer stock to smooth
investment in the face of adjustment costs. In subsequent periods, the initial increase
in saving produces current account deficits as countries shift their portfolios back to
their original composition.

IV. The Current Account and Investment
Over the past 20 years considerable empirical effort has been devoted to
documenting the correlations between investment and the current account. Two
stylized facts have emerged. First, cross-country correlations between investment and
the current account are weak (Penati and Dooley [1984], Tesar [1991]). Second, within
countries the time-series correlation between investment and the current account is
consistently negative (Glick and Rogoff [1995]). We document that these two stylized
facts hold in our sample of countries in Figure 10. In the top panel we plot long-run
averages of the current account as a fraction of GDP (on the vertical axis) against longrun investment rates (on the horizontal axis) for the 21 industrial countries in our
sample. Across countries, we find a very weak negative correlation between the two,
with a coefficient of –0.036. In the bottom panel, we plot the same two variables
expressed as deviations from country means, pooling all available annual

21

observations. Within countries, the correlation between investment and the current
account is strongly negative, with a coefficient of –0.329.15

This difference between the correlations between the current account and
investment in the long and short run are consistent with the view of the current account
proposed in this paper. To see this, it is useful to write the current account and
investment as follows:

(12)

CA ct = x ct ⋅ Sct + PR ct

(13)

Ict = (1 − x ct ) ⋅ Sct − PR ct

These equations decompose the current account and investment into their
portfolio-growth and portfolio-rebalancing components. The key observation to explain
the pattern of correlations between the current account and investment is that the longrun relationship between these variables is dominated by their portfolio-growth
components, while the short-run relationship is dominated by the portfolio-rebalancing
components. To make this statement precise, we decompose the coefficient of a
regression of the current account on investment into the contributions of portfolio
growth and portfolio rebalancing. Let β be this regression coefficient and define
βPG =

Cov( x ⋅ S,(1 − x ) ⋅ I)
Cov(CA,I) Cov( x ⋅ S,(1 − x ) ⋅ I)
−
and βPR =
. Since β=β PG+β PR,
Var(I)
Var(I)
Var(I)

we interpret β PG and β PR as the contributions of portfolio growth and portfolio
rebalancing to the relationship between the current account and investment.

When we perform this decomposition on the between estimator in the top panel
of Figure 10, we find that β PG=-0.041 and β PR=0.005. Consistent with the theory,
portfolio rebalancing plays no role in the long run and the relationship between the
current account and investment reflects only portfolio growth. Moreover, the theory
predicts that the correlation between the current account and investment should be
15

This is almost exactly the same as the average of country-by-country estimates reported in Glick and
Rogoff [1995].

22

negative in debtor countries (where x>1) and positive in creditor countries (where x<1).
The intuition is simple and follows immediately from the new rule: in debtor countries
increases in saving generate even greater increases in investment, leading to current
account deficits, while in creditor countries the increase in investment is less than that
of saving, leading to current account surpluses. Since our sample of countries consists
of a mixture of 15 debtor and 6 creditor countries, we should expect to find a negative
but not especially strong correlation between investment and the current account in a
cross-section that pools all countries together. This is exactly what we found in the top
panel of Figure 10. But when we divide our sample into debtors and creditors and
compute the correlations separately in the two groups, we should find a negative
correlation among debtors and a positive correlation among creditors. Figure 11 shows
that this is the case. Of course, we have only a very small sample of creditors and
debtors, and so these differences in slopes should be taken with a grain of salt.
Nevertheless, we note that they are consistent with the theory.

When we perform the same decomposition on the within estimator in the
bottom panel of Figure 10, we find that β PG=-0.014 and β PR=-0.315. Consistent with the
theory, portfolio rebalancing is important in the short run and this introduces a source
of negative correlation between the current account and investment. In the presence of
adjustment costs, a shock to income in a given period triggers an adjustment process
that lasts for many periods. In particular, a positive shock to income raises saving
contemporaneously and is followed by several periods of portfolio rebalancing, as
countries have higher than normal investment financed by current account deficits in
order to restore their pre-shock portfolios. The opposite occurs when there is a
negative shock. Thus positive shocks trigger a “ripple” effect of subsequent higher
investment and lower current accounts, and vice versa for negative shocks. This
“ripple” effect is a source of negative correlation between investment and the current
account within countries.

23

V. Concluding Remarks
By reconciling long and short run data, this paper completes the view of the
cyclical behavior of savings, investment and the current account in industrial countries
that we first proposed in Kraay and Ventura [2000]. Faced with income shocks,
countries smooth consumption by raising savings when income is high and vice versa.
In the short run, countries invest most of their savings in foreign assets, only to
rebalance their portfolios back to their original composition in the next four to five
years. In the long run, country portfolios are remarkably stable, the new rule applies
and fluctuations in savings lead to fluctuations in the current account that are equal to
savings times the share of foreign assets in the country portfolio. By using foreign
assets as a buffer stock, countries smooth investment in order to save on adjustment
costs.

An interesting implication of this view of international capital flows is that the
stock of foreign assets and the current account are more volatile than consumption,
investment and domestic capital stock. But this does not mean that international capital
flows are a factor that contributes to making macroeconomic aggregates more volatile
or unstable. To the contrary, the view presented here suggests that the ability to
purchase and sell foreign assets allows countries not only to smooth their
consumption, but also their investment. Foreign assets and the current account absorb
part of the volatility of these other macroeconomic aggregates.

Notes: This top (bottom) panel of this figure reports the impulse response of the portfolio rebalancing component
of the current account to a one-quarter (four-quarter) unit increase in saving implied by our estimates Equation
(11), using quarterly data for 12 OECD countries. The vertical bars denote one-standard deviation intervals
around the estimated coefficients.
