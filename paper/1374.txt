Excess Reserves in the Great Depression

ABSTRT

This article assesses the extent to which government-administered
financial shocks and lower interest rates can account for the massive

accumulation of bank excess reserves in the Great Depression. Both factors
are shown to be statistically significant. Financial shocks did exert a
statistically detectable influence on the demand for excess reserves but
those shocks at best can account for a step—like increase in the level of
reserves held, an increase which was completed in less than a year.
Financial shocks can explain no more than 1 percent of the variation in

excess reserves during the Great Depression. We demonstrate that the most
statistically appropriate form of the demand function is one which

flattened rapidly as interest rates fell. The fall in interest rates can
account for 80 percent of the movement of excess reserves during the Great
Depression.

I. INTRODUCTION

The unprecedented accumulation of excess reserves during the Great Depression fostered the view that the Federal Reserve might not have been able to

raise the money supply. The demand by banks for excess reserves might have
been so flat at low nominal interest rates that increases in the supply of high—
powered money would flow almost exclusively into excess reserves, all but com-

pletely stifling expansion of the stock of credit and money. Attempts to raise
the money supply by buying bonds "would simply increase the reserves of the
banking system by the amount of government bonds which were purchased with cur-

rency. The currency would go out, .

. . but

[it] would immediately go into the

banks and from the banks into the Federal Reserve Ranks . .

. and

you would

just have additional reserves, additional excess reserves." (U.S. Congress,
1935) That the banking system, for all practical purposes, had fallen into a
liquidity trap due to the lack of supply of earning assets was the majority

view for years. On this interpretation, the historical data listed in table 1
primarily reflect the tracing of a stationary excess reserves demand curve (DD)
by a shifting supply curve, as shown in figure 1.
The principal alternative explanation of the buildup is the Friedman—
Schwartz (1963) shock hypothesis, which claims that banks demanded more excess

reserves in the aftermath of financial crises. As the shock receded in time,
banks began to revise downward their desired stock of excess reserves. The observed accumulation resulted from a demand curve that remained relatively steep
but was "shocked" rightward by the jarring financial market disturbances of the

1930s. Such shifts, coupled with rightward supply schedule shifts, masked that
steepness and the concomitant ability of the Fed to raise the money supply. To
wit, the

—1—

—2—

observed inverse correlation between the . . . deposit—reserve ratio
and high—powered money during the period under consideration is a
coincidence. . . . In our view, that behavior is to be interpreted
as the result of two successive shifts in the preferences of banks
for reserve funds, and the adaptation of portfolio positions to the
changed preferences. The first shift occurred as a result of the
experience during 1929—33, and the adaptation took about three years,
from 1933 to 1936. The second occurred as a result of the successive
rises in reserve requirements, reinforced by the occurrence of a
severe contraction that was a stern reminder of the earlier experience. The adaptation to it took about the same length of time, from
1937 to 1940. In both cases, the adaptations occurred in an
environment of generally declining interest rates which, even with
stable preferences, would have induced banks to hold larger
reserves. (Friedman and Schwartz 1963, pp. 538—539)

Thus, the huge stocks of excess reserves held long after the passing of each
shock are accounted for by the sluggish adjustment of bank portfolios.
tost nonmonetarists admit that such shocks might raise bank demands tor
excess reserves, but they do not necessarily believe the shifts took place in

the manner outlined by Friedman and Schwartz. Tobin, for instance, argues that
there was no reason

why shifts in liquidity preference resulting from discrete events
should proceed so smoothly, and in particular with such striking
negative correlation with the growth of high—powered money. Did
bankers never take heart again, even when the deposit—currency ratio
was rising and bank runs seemed to be a thing of the past? It may
be that the introduction of variation of reserve requirements into
the Federal Reserve's tool kit occasioned an increase in the demand
for excess reserves. If so, it would be more reasonable to expect
this to occur in 1935 when the legislation was passed but the powers
were yet to be used, rather than after 1937 when requirements were
already at, or very near, the maximumm permitted by Congress.
(Tobin 1965, p. 480)

On this view, banks realized by mid—1937 that the Fed had no further authority

to convert excess into required reserves. Banks were therefore unlikely to
hold excess reserves as a precaution against an outlawed eventuality. Furtier,
by the late l930s, the public seemed unlikely to suddenly attempt to convert

deposits into currency. In crises prior to the inception of federa1 deposit
insurance in 1934, customers reduced bank liquidity drastically, even

—3—

catastrophically, by withdrawing high—powered money out of fear that their de-

posits would evaporate in a financial panic. After the creation of the FDIC,
there were almost no bank runs. It seems likely that bankers realized that
"federal deposit insurance (had) been accompanied by a dramatic change in commercial bank failures and in losses borne by depositors in banks that fail.'
(Friedman and Schwartz 1963, p. 437)1

If they believed that their customers

believed in the efficacy of deposit insurance, bankers would not hold massive

stocks of excess reserves to guard against these runs after 1934. Nonmonetar—
ists thus view these two major sources of reserve outflows as inoperative
starting in the mid—1930s, the period when excess reserve accumulation was so

dramatic. Bankers may have reasonably held excess reserves as a precaution
against larger reserve requirements and as a precaution against reserve with-

drawals by a public that feared bank failures. &it, by the end of 1937, both
of these stimuli to excess reserve demand had been eliminated.
Despite the wide divergence between these explanations and in the policy
recommendations that follow, we still know little about how much of observed

excess reserve behavior each can account for. This paper seeks to fill that

gap. We use estimates of bank asset demands to evaluate the magnitude and timing of excess reserve movements associated with each. We first address estimation issues and then direct our attention to the appropriate functional form of

the interest rate term in the demand for excess reserves. Though the bivariate
relation between excess reserves and interest rates is clearly nonlinear, we
allow the data to determine whether the demand function flattened

appreciably

as rates fell or whether it remained steep but was shifted rightward by financial shocks.

Next we examine the empirical case for the hypothesis that financial
shocks in the form of 'liquidity crises" caused the excess reserve demand func-

tion to shift rightward. In particular we look at the effect of Great Britain's

—4—

departure from the gold standard, of bank runs, and of increases in required
reserve ratios on the demand for excess reserves, and evaluate whether demand

rose appreciably in response to these shocks. We distinguish between the statistical significance of these shocks as measured by t—statistics and their
economic or practical importance as measured by the proportion of additional

excess reserves holdings which the shock effect can account for. After similarly assessing the impact of declining interest rates brought about by weakening asset supplies, we evaluate the relative contribution of these two sets of

factors in different stages of the Great Depression. The concluding section
assesses the policy implications of our findings.

II. PANK ASSET DEMAND AND SUPPLY

Banks are assumed to maximize expected, discounted, real profits subject

to uncertainty and adjustment costs. Given a stock of free assets (total assets
less required reserves), each bank allocates it among three available asset
classes (loans, investments, and excess reserves) as a function of relative
risks and returns:2

A*

(E*
1* =
L*

C

EC ER

tC lR IW"

(1)

3LC LR LW

A* is the vector of desired asset stocks, whose elements are the desired stocks

of excess reserves (E*), investments (1*), and loans (L*). X is the vector of
K

explanatory variables common to each asset.

Among its elements are a con-

stant term, an interest rate term (R), and the stock of tree assets or alloca-

ble wealth (W). The matrix of long—run coefficients is denoted by .

—5—

The difference in real returns between excess reserves, which paid no

interest, and investments and loans is the nominal interest rate. We include a

variable, R, the nominal rate on short—term government securities as a proxy
for that return differential.3 The stock of each asset held also depends on
the size of the portfolio of allocable assets, W.
The adding—up constraints stressed by &ainard and Tobin (1968) imply
that neither a discrepancy between actual and desired asset stocks nor the con-

sequent portfolio adjustment will be confined generally to a single asset. To
the extent that banks incur adjustment costs that rise as a function of the
speed of adjustment, their portfolios will adjust less than instantaneously.
Though interest rates may adjust without lags, the existence of outstanding,
ciultiperiod loans and long—term relations between banks and their customers may

keep portfolios from adjusting completely within one quarter. To allow for
this possibility we incorporate a partial adjustment mechanism. The change in
actual stocks is a function of the difference between all desired and actual
stocks:

The shock model claims that the liquidity crises of the 1930s shifted

banks' excess reserve demand functions rightward. To capture this effect, we
have constructed a proxy variable, FS:

FS =

FSla + FS2a + FS3a

(5)

where FS1, FS2, and FS3 are, respectively, the reciprocal of the number of quarters since the last quarter of 1931, the first quarter of 1933, and the first

quarter of 1937 and c, which allows the expectations of future shocks to decay
with time, is set equal to 0.4. These periods correspond to the major financial
shocks of the period identified by Friedman and Schwartz (the withdrawal of reserves associated with Great Britain's departure from the gold standard, bank
runs, and the increase in reserve requirements) and are the same dates used by
Morrison (1966) .

FS

then traces out the declining impact of past crisis experi-

ence on crisis expectations. The individual components have been raised to the
power of 0.4 to generate a proxy that closely approximates the shock variable
Morrison employed .
A variable, IUBIN, has been constructed to test for James Tobin's (1965)

suggestion that banks adjusted their portfolios as a function of the legal abil-

ity of the Fed to alter required reserves. Until passage of the Pnking Act of
1935, required reserve ratios had been specified by an amendment to the Federal

Reserve Act. These ratios were first effective on June 21, 1917. The Panking
Act of 1935, which became law in August 1935, empowered the Fed to raise the

ratios up to double the previous percentages after that. That is, the legal—
maximum time deposit ratios rose from 3 to 6 percent and the central reserve
city demand deposit ratio rose from 13 to 26 percent.
The Fed did not immediately double these ratios bu't it was then that it

first received the legaL authority to raise them. To the extent that it had not
raised ratios to double their previous leveL after it received the authority to

—7—

do so, the Fed retained the ability to raise theni in the future. Once the ratios were raised to the new legal—maxima, the Fed could exert no further con—

tractionary impulse from that particular direction. Tobin questioned Friedman
and Schwartz's contention that excess reserves were held after the 1937—38 contraction to provide a cushion against the Fed's further raising of reserve requirements since the Fed did not have the authority to raise them further.
IDBIN is calculated as the constant—dollar difference between required
reserves, given demand and time deposits, calculated at the legal—maximum re-

serve ratios and at those ratios which actually prevailed at time t. Thus,

TOBIN =

(RRMAXDD

—

RRDD)(NETDD)

+ (RRMAXTh -

(6)

RRTh)(TD)

where RRMAXDD = the legal maximum reserve ratio for net demand deposits, RRDD
the prevailing reserve ratio for net demand deposits, RRMAXTD = the legal maxi—
mum reserve ratio for time deposits, and RRID = the prevailing reserve ratio
for time deposits.5

When required reserve ratios are less than the legal maxima established by
Congress, IDBIN is positive and the Fed retains the power to exert further con—

tractionary influence by raising the ratios. When requirements equal their
maxima, TOBIN will be identically zero, there being no further conversion of
excess to required reserves legally possible.

We also include IP, the ratio of industrial production to its own 1921—

1941 trend. IP is basically a cyclical variable that attempts to capture the
changes of loan supply (to banks by individuals and firms) not mirrored in re-

ported interest rates. Including these variables, (4) becomes:

E =

+
cz0

+ c2L1 + cz3L1 + a,W + a5R ÷ ci6FS + cL7IP + e.

(7)

—8—

We expect our estimated coefficients to exhibit the following signs. Higher
rates raise the cost of holding funds idle. Thus,

a1 will be negative. Foth

shock variables, FS and TUBIN, increase the desire to hold excess reserves and

accordingly carry positive coefficients. Since larger banks have larger (in
absolute terms) risks of withdrawal and default, the scale variable, W, will

have a positive effect on excess reserves. As output rises, banks may accommodate their customers' requests for funds without allowing the interest rate to

ration these funds entirely. The variable, IP, then captures a cyclical effect
and will negatively affect excess reserve holdings. The own—lagged asset term,
will be positive while the coefficients on the other lagged assets, which
are the negative of the speed of adjustment of excess reserves to disequilibria
in investments and loans, will be negative.
This formulation embodies the constraints implied by portfolio theory

generally, in each short run period and in the long run. Asset demands are
homogeneous of degree zero with respect to prices. The net change across assets due to a change in interest rates or any other nonscale variable is zero.
The sum of individual asset reactions to a one—dollar change in portfolio size

is unity. The response of each asset to a differential—preserving change in

interest rates is zero. All adjustment patterns are consistent in that the sum
of asset holdings implied by the model during adjustment to equilibrium equals
the actual stock.
Foth the interest rate, R, and the size of the allocable portfolio, W,
become endogenous regressors in a simultaneous equation system characterized by

fractional reserve banking.6 This endogeneity renders ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimates of (7) inconsistent. Below we estimate both supply and reduced—
form equations for each asset to support our contention that the candidate variables to be used as instruments are likely, in practice, to identify the demand
parameters and serve usefully in two—stage least squares (TSLS) estimation.

—9—

The supply of excess reserves depends on two types of factors. First it
depends on the exogenous government—controlled factors, high—powered money (H)

and required reserve ratios (RRR). As more high—powered money is provided or
lower required reserve ratios are instituted, more reserves are held. The second set of factors are those that measure the competition for reserves. Given
the stock of high—powered money, the larger the supply of loans and investments

(to banks), the lower the stock of excess reserves. For instance, if higher
government spending increases the supply of bonds, banks react in part by reducing their excess reserves and holding more bonds at the higher interest

rate. Since excess reserves act not only as a defense against withdrawal and
reserve requirement risk but also as a temporary abode of loanable funds, factors that drive up the supply of other assets will tend to sharpen the competition for the remaining excess reserves.

No doubt changes in the demand for loans (by the banks' customers)
and in the supply of investments, and the large increase in available
reserves produced by the gold inflows——all of which constituted
changes in the supply of assets for banks to hold——played a role in
the shifts in asset composition. (Friedman and Schwartz 1953, p. 453)

As loans and investments rise in response to increased output, each bank re-

duces its excess reserves. With H and RRR fixed, excess reserves fall.
In addition to H, RRR, and IP, we hypothesize that five other exogenous

factors appreciably affect the supply of assets to banks: HHS, DP, KEXP, GSP,

and TAX. HHS is standardized households; DP is the dividend—price ratio; KEXP
is real capital expenditures in manufacturing; GSP is real federal government
expenditure; TAX is real federal government receipts.

HI-IS influences the sup-

ply of mortgages and other building loans. DP reflects the price to firms of

obtaining funds directly through capital markets by issuing stock. KEXP re—
flects businesses' needs for financing of capital investment. GSP and TAX

—10—

measure the extent to which the federal government will increase or decrease
its stock of outstanding bonds.
Allowing for lagged adjustment on the supply side, then, yields an
excess reserve supply function:

E =

o

÷

÷ 2I_l

+ f33L1 ÷

134R

+ 5DP + 6GSP +

8KEXP + 39ElRS ÷ 110IP

+

TAX +

+ I12RRR + e.

(8)

The demand and the supply functions can then be solved jointly to obtain reduced—form expressions for E, I, and L as linear functions only of exogenous
variables:

A =

+

51A1 + 521P ÷ 53FS + 641W ÷ S5GSP

+ 5TAX + 67KEXP +

8IiHS + 59H + S10RRR + e

(9)

where A is the three—element vector of asset stocks (E, I, and L) and each
5 is a vector of like size. The coefficients in each of the expressions in
(9) are combinations of structural parameters. The demand parameters are each

overidentified. This can be verified by noting that the number of variables
excluded from the demand functions (DP, GSP, TAX, KEXP, HHS, El, RRR) exceeds
the number of included, endogenous variables (R, W, and El, I, or L) minus one.

The supply parameters are just—identified. The number of excluded, exogenous
variables (FS) just equals the number of included, endogenous variables (R and
E, I, or L) minus one.
Our sample begins in 1921 in order to allow the effects of the Treasury's

financing of World War I to dissipate. The sample ends in 1941. Extending the
sample further backward or forward increases the chances that the war—specific

portfolio allocations would contaminate the sample. All data are seasonally

adjusted and quarterly.7 The sample covers weekly reporting, New York ty,

—11-

member banks. These banks account for about 90 percent of total New York City
member deposits. The sample excludes nontnember and non—New York City banks in
order to prevent distributional shifts of deposits between member and nonmember

banks and between various classes of member banks from generating changes in
required, and thus in excess, reserves.8
The dependent variable in all excess reserve functions is "effective"

excess reserves. Since only reserves held at the Fed were considered legal
reserves, vault cash was excluded from the Fed's measures of legal and thus

excess reserves. If banks considered vault cash to serve equally well as deposits at the Fed their behavior will be reflected more accurately by effective

excess reserves. Thus we add vault cash to legal excess reserves, obtaining
effective excess reserves. As a measure of the foregone income associated with
holding excess reserves, we use the interest rate on default—free short—term
Treasury securities.

Table 2 presents estimates of excess reserve and earning—asset supply

functions. Each of the hypothesized factors, except DP which is henceforth
dropped, significantly influences the supply of excess reserves. The reduced
form estimates for each bank asset appear in table 3. In all, six of these
variables (HHS, KEXP, GSP, TAX, Ii, and RRR) are statistically significant in

the determination of excess reserves. These estimated reduced form parameters
are complicated combinations of our structural parameters and tell us little

about the long—run parameter estimates directly. Nonetheless, taken as esti—
mates of short—run reduced form parameters, they do provide some insight into

issues of interest. First, neither government spending, taxation, nor changes
in required reserve ratios seem to have exerted noticeable impact on either in-

vestments or loans. There is no evidence ot crowding out in this sense. Consistent with the investment and loan equations, the estimates imply that changes
in GSP, TAX, and RRR (as well as KEXP) had a large impact on excess reserves.

—12—

These are the results we would expect if the demand function for excess reserves
flattened appreciably as rates fell.

Also notable is the failure of changes in required reserve ratios to reduce holdings of any asset except excess reserves. The estimates imply that in
the 1930s only excess reserves were statistically significantly affected by

changes in required reserve ratios. Investments also were reduced by these
changes but the effect is not strong enough to pass conventional significance

tests. Since a large portion of the investment portfolio in this era consisted
of short—run government notes and bills, the effect on private credit was probably small indeed. The reduced form evidence then suggests that banks were
"loose' in the sense that changes in reserve requirements, as well as changes in
high—powered money, primarily produced changes in excess reserves and not in

credit. These supply changes did not alter the quantity demanded significantly:
the demand functions were relatively flat. As Tobin (1966) claimed, raising
reserve requirements may have been a mistake but it was probably a relatively
harmless one.
Thus, theory and the results from tables 2 and 3 support the suggested
exogenous supply variables (GSP, TAX, KEXP, HHS, H, RRR) as candidates for being

instruments. In particular, they have been shown to be relevant to a nearby"
part of the economy and to have strongly influenced the supply of excess reserves in this period.

III. DID ThE KCESS RESERVE DEMAND (JJRVE FLATTEN?

To test whether the demand for excess reserves depends linearly on interest rates or flattens (or steepens) as rates fall, we search over integer expo-

nents for R from —2 to +2. Table 4 points to the log of R as the best—fitting
specification for excess reserves and for loans. The reciprocal of R, which
also flattens rapidly as rates fall, is optimal for investments. To test

—13—

whether the fit using one functional form is statistically superior to the alternative forms, we calculate chi—square statistics with one degree of freedom

for each asset.'° The functional form that delivers the best fit is denoted by
an asterisk. 0-u—square values exceeding the critical value for the 95—percent
level of confidence are associated with forms that fit significantly worse than

that minimum s.e.e. form. According to this criterion, the log of rates in the
excess reserves and in the loan demand functions is a statistically superior

specification to each of the four alternatives considered. The reciprocal form
performs significantly better than the alternatives in the investment demand

function. On this evidence, we reject the hypothesis that any of these demand
functions remained steep as rates fell. To enable us to easily impose cross—
equation constraints, we take the log transformation of interest rates as the

optimal specification for each of the asset demand functions. The log specification does imply a decreasing elasticity of demand with respect to rates.
However, the demand function still rapidly approaches (but never reaches) the
horizontal since the slope in this specification is proportional to the level

of interest rates. Since rates fell in the late 1930s to about one—hundredth
of their late 1920s values, so did the slope of the demand function.
Based on that specification of the interest rate term, we present our

asset demand estimates in table 5. The parameter constraints implied by general portfolio theory discussed in Section II are automatically imposed here
since the same explanatory variables enter each demand function, wealth is included as one of the explanatory variables, and the functions are linear in the
parameters (though nonlinear in the variables) (see Smith(1975)). Tt.io—stage

least squares estimation is applied, equation by equation, using instruments we

have shown to be relevant to this market. In addition, the estimates do not
appear to be plagued by residual autocorrelation (the normally distributed
Durbin h—statistics are undefined) and thow—type stabiLity tests performed over

—14—

a sample split at 1931:02 do not suggest unstable parameters. These features

raise our confidence that our estimates are consistent. Nearly all (nineteen
out of twenty—one) coefficient estimates are statistically significant. Only
the effect of lagged investments and of financial shocks in the loan equation

are not. About $0.50 of each additional allocable dollar banks receive flows
into investments in that first quarter. The remainder ($l.0O—$O.467) is split
almost equally between loans and excess reserves. The interest rate effect operates in the expected direction for each asset. Higher rates lead to fewer
excess reserves, more investments, and more loans. Financial shocks lead to
larger holdings of excess reserves, smaller holdings of investments, but only a
negligible change in loans initially.
There are significant lags in the adjustment of the asset holdings.
Given own— and cross—asset adjustments, the lag lengths are not readily seen.
In general, they appear to be shorter than the three years suggested by Fried-

man and Schwartz. The adjustment to a financial shock, for example, is approximately half completed in four quarters and virtually complete in two years.
(Technically, of course, lagged dependent variable models imply that adjustment

is never complete.) Table 6 presents the long—run responses of each asset to
changes in the explanatory variables. The vast majority of additions to the

portfolio eventually seeps into loans, as we would expect. As rates rise, in
the long run, loans expand while both excess reserves and investments fall.
Perhaps most interesting, though a shock lowers loans by little initially, the
estimated long run impact of a permanent financial shock would have been to
raise excess reserves, and to a smaller extent raise investments, but reduce

loans by a large amount. Initially, banks dump investments, but to a much
lesser extent due to their illiquidity, they reduce loans when a financial

shock strikes. As time proceeds, banks raise their excess reserve holdings
substantially and attain a net positive change in excess reserves and in

—15--

investments, all at the expense of loans. Thus, the estimates imply that the
effect of a financial shock is to drive banks to portfolios that are more liquid, just as Friedman and Schwartz suggested.''

IV. SHOCKS AND INTEREST RATES: SIGNIFIGLNCE VS. IMPORTANCE

In the previous sections we provided evidence on the effect of both fi—
naricial shocks and interest rates on the demand for excess reserves. Each exerts a statistically detectable short—run influence and an even larger long—run
influence on the quantity of excess reserves held by banks during the Great De-

pression. The estimates thus support the Friedman and Schwartz contention that
such shocks did shift banks' desire to hold cash. The previous section also
established the superiority of an interest rate specification that flattened

rapidly as rates fell. We selected the log of rates as the statistically most

appropriate and were able to rule Out forms that did not flatten. This is consistent with the suggestion that "banks were by the mid—thirties moving along a

fairly flat liquidity preference curve." (Tobin 1965, p. 480)
Statistical significance does not estabish the practical or economic im-

pact of either rates or of financial shocks on excess reserve holdings. To do
that, we employ a simulation technique. Using the estimates from table 5, we
first simulate values for each asset. Starting from an initial period (1931:2),
we fix all explanatory variables at their levels for the initial period, allowing only interest rates (and the lagged, simulated value for each asset) to

change. This simulated series then captures the reaction of excess reserves
over the 1931:2—1941:4 period to the actual changes in rates. The procedure is
repeated to generate simulated values with only the shock proxy, FS, taking on

its actual values. The historical values for excess reserves (E), the series
attributable to interest rate movements (ER), and that due to shocks (EFS) are

—16—

plotted in figure 2. As a test of model validity, we have also simulated, but
not plotted, an excess reserve series allowing all variables to take on their

actual values (except lagged dependent variables). Table 7 shows that, overall,
this dynamic simulation faithfully reproduces the historical data quite well.
The statistical significance of the shock term belies its relatively insignificant practical role in explaining the accumulation of excess reserves
during the 1930s. Shocks just cannot explain the build—up in the late or imid—

1930s. FS can account for, even overexplain, the rise in the early 1930s. The
shock proxy predicts the rise in excess reserves of about a billion dollars by

1935 but implies decumulation thereafter. It was after 1934, and in particular
after 1937, however, that actual excess reserves really began to pile up. The
shock variable indicates no such pattern, even after allowing for lagged adjust-

ment. Thus Friedman and Schwartz's claim that the buildups after 1933 and after
1937 each lasted for three years finds little support. Neither the 1935—36 nor
the 1938—40 accumlation reflects the adjustment of excess reserve stocks to

shocks to the banking system. Nor can the inability of FS to explain the accumulation of excess reserves be attributed to a specification that implies an
implausibly short nleniory, especially in light of the structural changes (such

as the advent of the FDIC) and the institutional constraints (such as the effective reserve requirement ceiling) in place by the latter l930s, for PS declines quite slowly, still retaining half of its immediate post—shock value
nearly six quarters after the shock and 40 percent after almost ten quarters.

Interest rates do better. Though they predict a decline in the early
l930s and account for but a small portion of the variation through 1935 (see
table 7), rates can explain about half the increase in excess reserves up until
the first rise in reserve requirements in 1936. They also explain about one—

third of the rise from 1937 until their peak in 1940.12 I' the end of L94l,
the interest—rate—propelled simulated series is right on track.

—17—

These simulations reveal that, in spite of the strong statistical showing of both shocks and interest rates, only rates add appreciably to the expla-

nation of excess reserves in the latter l930s. Financial shocks did perceptibly shift the demand for excess reserves rightward. The accumulation due to
this shift, however, pales in comparison to the accumulation due to falling in-

terest rates. Rates and shocks each mattered. Rates mattered more.

V. DNCLUS1ON

During

its

Latter stages and in the two decades that followed the Great

Depression, there was a consensus that the Fed was unable to push the economy

out of the slump. The hegemony of this interpretation was shattered in the
early 1960s when Friedman and Schwartz fired the opening salvo in the monetar—
ist counterrevolution." They argued that the appearance of a flat excess reserve demand function was the result of shocks to the financial sector that
drove that demand curve sharply rightward, corresponding incidentally with the

rightward supply shift. We demonstrate that such shocks to demand did exert a

detectable influence on holdings of excess reserves. Our estimates show, however, that though such demand side shocks can account for the rise in excess
reserves in the early 1930s, they cannot explain the continuing rise after 1935
or 1937, nor the sharp downturn in the early l940s.
Our results indicate that the decline in interest rates had a much Larg-

er impact on bank portfolios. Statistical tests decisively reject the hypothesis that the demand for excess reserves remained steep. On the contrary, it

became extremely flat at low rates. Visual inspection of the plots of actual
excess reserves and the simulated paths due to interest rates alone and to
shocks alone show that interest rates were far more important in determining

excess reserves in the l930s than were financial shocks. The summary statistics

—18—

in table 7 clearly illustrate the economic or practical importance of lower
rates and the near—zero contribution of shocks to rising excess reserves after

mid—1935. The simulations also indicate that the effect of shocks was transitory in that it resulted in a rise to a higher excess reserve ratio and then a

decline. Continually falling rates, on the other hand, led to a continually
rising excess reserve—wealth ratio and corresponding continual fall in the money supply multiplier in the latter 1930s.
Consistent with this supply—dominated determination of excess reserves
is the weak impact of high—powered money in reduced form expressions for in-

vestments and loans in this period. Our estimates imply that high—powered money increases of the type that nonsterilized gold flows initiated in the late
1930s and early 1940s would not raise investment or loan holdings appreciably.
Witness the huge rise in high—powered money and the virtually constant level of
private credit that existed in that period.
Though our estimates do not imply that the demand curve became perfectly

flat, its slope did decrease dramatically. The money supply multiplier was not
zero and therefore monetary policy was not totally impotent. The low level of
rates was, however, associated with near—zero values for the excess reserve de-

mand function slope and for the multiplier. Why did excess reserves suddenly
plummet in the early l940s? The passing of the shock effect cannot account for

more than 1 percent of the decline. The rise in interest rates, though small
in levels, was relatively large in logarithms (i.e., proportionally) and ac-

counts for 8 percent of the $2 to $3 billion drop. The rest is explained primarily by supply factors. Government spending and the accompanying deficit
revved up in the early 1940s, of course, and this exogenous source drove up the

supply of public and private loans of bonds to banks. The halting of gold flows
from abroad at this time (due to the initiation of the Lend—Lease program) cur-

tailed the rising supply of high—powered money. The resulting leftward shift in

—19—

the excess reserve supply function produced a precipitous fall in the stock of
excess reserves.

2Th1s approach draws upon the work of Bisignano (1971), Frost (1971)

Morrison (1966), Niehans (1978), and Pierce (1967). Without uncertainty or adjustment costs, excess reserves are not held, being dominated by riskiess, net

interest—bearing assets. Recorded interest rates are assumed not to capture
all aspects of the relative attractiveness of various assets due to considerations like long—run, customer relations between banks and borrowers, for exam-

ple. The liability side of banks' balance sheets are taken as given here.
3The risk of capital gain or loss for this maturity is very smaLl. Omitting a separate loan rate should not importantly affect the estimates since
that rate differs from the government rate by a default—risk premium leaving

the risk—adjusted differential at zero. Williams (1964) notes that Treasury
notes could be used to purchase Treasury bonds at par at least in the latter

193Os. Since bonds sold above par then, the "above par' value accrued to the
price of notes, driving their yields below zero for a long time. The yield we
use after 1930 is that for bills, which came with no such bond price option.
These bill yields are always positive.

4We found 0.4 to be the statistically optimal power for FS when FS is
the sum of nonexponentiated individual shock proxies.

5Required reserves were based on net demand deposits which differ from
total demand deposits approximately by federal government deposits and float.

—21—

6The exogeneity of R and of W are strongly rejected according to the
Nakamura and Nakamura (1981) criterion. The F—statistics associated with the
null hypothesis of exogeneity are 44, 169, and 428 for excess reserves, invest—
inents, and loans, respectively.

7The discount rate and the shock variables are not seasonally adjusted. A
data appendix with detailed descriptions and sources of all variables is available upon request.
8These shifts, along with shifts between demand and time deposits,

account for about 40 percent of the change in the aggregate, total reserve—

deposit ratio in the 1930s. Cagan (1965), pp. 180—181.
9This closely approximates searching over

X in (RX_l)/X. As X ap-

proaches zero, that expression approaches the log of R. We use the log of R as
the relevant transformation when the exponent is zero.

10The chi—square test statistic is calculated as (N)(1og(SSR/SSRQ))

where N is the number of observations, and SSRA and SSR0 are the sums of
squared residuals 1or the alternative and the best—fitting functional forms,
respectively.

11The estimated long—run responses also produce some anomalies, thief
among them are those for the output proxy in the excess reserve and loan equa-

tions. The negative interest rate coefficient for investments is also surprising. Whether any of these is statistically different from zero is not obvious.
Though the actual long—run coefficients for wealth are presumably between zero
and one, some of our estimates lie outside that range. The nonlinear derivation
of these coefficients may make the long—run estimates very sensitive to the
short—run estimates.

simulation begun in 1938:2 implies that interest rates account for
about two—thirds and shocks one—third of the accumulation of excess reserves
after that point.

}XP —— Capital Expenditures for

seasonally adjusted.

Source: Chawner (1941).
Since Chawner provides data only through 1940, we have generated

the quarterly observations for 1941 as follows. Chawner's estimate for 1940 is multiplied by the ratio of nominal net private
domestic investment in 1941 to that in 1940 as reported in U.S.
Department of Commerce (1976), page 345, Table 5.2, line 3.
This annual

estimate

is then converted into quarterly flows by

apoortioning the annual flow according to Gilbert's (1947)

C

estimate of the quarterly flows of the sum of new

construction

and producerst durable equipment. These four nominal, not seasonally adjusted, flows are appended to the Chawner series that

ends in 1940. The entire series is then

converted

to real terms

and then seasonally adjusted.

L — Loans
Real, seasonally adjusted.

Source: Banking and Monetary Statistics, pp. 166—193.

NETDD —— Net Demand Deposits

Real, seasonally adjusted. From January 1921 until August 1934,
net demand deposits are taken from Banking and 1onetary

tics, pp. 166—193. From September 1934 on, published nct demand
deposit data are not available. Estimates of nominal net demand

deposits are calculated as follows. For the period September
1934 through July 1935, we follow the instructions on pages 65
and 66 in Banking and Monetary Statistics, subtractiflg U.S. gov-

ernment demand deposits, deposits with other banks, and cash
items in process of collection from total demand deposits (pp.

180—183). From August 1935, until the end of the sample in December 1941, nominal net demand deposits are estimated by subtracting deposits with other banks and cash items in process of

collection from total demand deposits. These data come from
Banking and Monetary Statistics, pp. 182—195.

Though Banking and onetarv Statistics, p. 65—6F, hints
that

our approximation is likely to be good, we

have

scght

other evidence that our estimates provide an accurate represen-

tation of actual net demand deposits. To check on the closeness
of our approxImation, we have constructed our nominal approxiraa—
tiOfl, NETDD, for New York City member banks for the 56 call

dates between January 1919 and

June 1934. We compare NETDD with -

the reported nominal net demand deposit, NETDD, for those same
dates. Regressing NETDD on NETDD yields:
