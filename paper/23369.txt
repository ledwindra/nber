Prices of High-Tech Products, Mismeasurement, and Pace of Innovation

ABSTRACT
Two recent papers have made compelling cases that mismeasurement of prices of high tech
products cannot explain the slow pace of labor productivity growth that has prevailed since the
mid-2000s. Does that result indicate that mismeasurement of high-tech products has limited
implications for patterns of economic growth? The answer in this paper is “no.” We demonstrate
that the understatement of price declines for high-tech products in official measures has a
dramatic effect on the pattern of MFP growth across sectors. In particular, we show that
correcting this mismeasurement implies faster MFP growth in high-tech sectors and slower MFP
advance outside the high-tech sector. If MFP growth is taken as a rough proxy for the pace of
innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than the rate
that would be inferred from official statistics (and less rapid outside high-tech). These results
deepen the productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in high-tech sectors has been more
rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that overall labor
productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years.

1. Introduction
Economists and others have offered many explanations for the slowdown in U.S.
productivity growth that began in the mid-2000s, with labor productivity in the business
sector rising just over ½ percent at an annual rate from 2010 to 2015, well below the pace
over the boom years of 1995-2004 and even below the already reduced rate that prevailed
over 2004-2010. Focusing on the supply side of the economy, Gordon (2016) argues that
the IT revolution is just not as big a deal as the second industrial revolution and that the
boost to productivity growth rates from IT largely is behind us.1 Focusing on the demand
side, Summers (2014) has resurrected the Depression-era term “secular stagnation,”
arguing that the economy is generating insufficient demand. Others have argued that the
tools of economic measurement have not kept up with the digital revolution and that
economic growth has been stronger than reflected in official statistics. One strand of this
argument focuses on items within the current scope of GDP, positing mismeasurement of
key GDP components. (See Goldman Sachs (2015 and 2016), for example.) Another
strand looks beyond the current scope of GDP, making the case that economic welfare
has improved much more rapidly than have measures of productivity.2
This paper contributes to the “within GDP” debate, focusing on the
mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products. As noted, Goldman Sachs and others
have made the case that the productivity slowdown can be explained, at least in part, by
mismeasurement of the digital economy. Since that argument emerged, two papers have
countered that claim. Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) carefully examined the
1

Fernald (2014) and Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013) provide growth-accounting evidence documenting
the dropback in the contribution from the use and production of high-tech products to labor and multifactor
productivity (MFP) growth. Fernald, Hall, Stock, and Watson (2017) highlight the important role of slower
MFP growth and a decline in labor force participation in the slowdown in labor productivity growth.

evidence and concluded that mismeasurement does not provide an explanation of the
slowdown. Syverson (2016), using a completely different methodology, also made a
compelling case that mismeasurement cannot explain the productivity slowdown.
But, is this the end of the story? Should we conclude that mismeasurement of
high-tech prices and the digital economy have no important consequences for patterns of
economic growth? This paper argues that mismeasurement does matter. In particular,
mismeasurement matters for the allocation and pattern of multifactor productivity (MFP)
growth across sectors. To demonstrate this, we take estimates of the amount of
mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products from the literature and feed these
through a standard growth accounting framework to examine the implications of this
mismeasurement for sectoral MFP growth.
Our results show that the mismeasurement of high-tech prices has a dramatic
effect on the pattern of MFP growth across sectors. Specifically, the faster decline of
prices of high-tech products implies a faster pace of MFP growth in high-tech sectors and
a slower rate of MFP advance outside the high-tech sector. If we take MFP growth as a
rough proxy for the pace of innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech
sector has been more rapid than the rate that would be inferred from official statistics
(and even slower outside high-tech). At the same time, our results confirm that this
mismeasurement does not explain the labor productivity slowdown and has a relatively
modest effect on aggregate MFP growth.
We believe these results are important for three reasons. First, they deepen the
productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in the high-tech sectors has been more
rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that

4

overall labor productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years. Second, we
believe narratives about the prospects for growth have been improperly darkened by the
view that innovation, even in the tech sector, has been weak. According to official
statistics, prices of tech products have barely been falling in recent years. And, that slow
rate of price decline in the tech sector has implied, via the dual approach to productivity
measurement, a slow rate of MFP growth. This has led, in turn, to inferences that the
pace of innovation in the tech sector has faltered.3 Finally, a faster rate of innovation in
the tech sector implies, via a multi-sector growth model, a faster steady-state rate of
growth in labor productivity even with the slower rate of MFP growth outside the tech
sector. Accordingly, we argue that the pattern of MFP growth across industries may
presage a second wave of productivity advance supported by the digital economy.4

2. A Standard Framework for Growth Accounting
We use a standard framework for growth accounting, as described in Fernald
(2014) and Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013). That framework has two basic elements: 1)
a decomposition of labor productivity growth into contributions from capital deepening,
labor quality, and MFP; and 2) a decomposition of MFP growth into contributions from
different sectors. For the decomposition of labor productivity, the key equation is:
𝑦−ℎ =

!
!
!!! 𝛼! (𝑘!

− ℎ) + 𝛼! 𝑞 + 𝑚𝑓𝑝

(1)

where 𝑦 is the growth rate of output, ℎ is the growth rate of total hours, 𝑘! is the growth
rate of capital services for capital of type i, 𝛼!! is the income share for capital of type i,

3

For example, see figure 13-1 in Gordon (2016) and the surrounding discussion.
In a similar vein, van Ark (2016) argues that the digital economy is still in the “installation” phase and
that growth may pick up when the “deployment” phase is reached.
4

5

𝛼! 𝑞 is the contribution of changes in labor quality to labor productivity growth and 𝑚𝑓𝑝
is the growth rate of MFP. Although time subscripts have been suppressed for
expositional clarity, all of the variables and parameters in equation 1 (including the
income shares) are time varying.
We modify Fernald’s framework by disaggregating capital into five broad types:
computer hardware, communications equipment, software, other intellectual property
(research and development and artistic originals), and all other capital. We assume
constant returns to scale so the labor income share (𝛼! ) and the capital income shares
sum to one. Finally, although not shown in equation 1, we include an adjustment for the
utilization of capital.
We also extend Fernald’s framework by including a more detailed decomposition
of MFP growth. This decomposition is described in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013),
and can be expressed as:
𝑚𝑓𝑝 =

!
!!! 𝜇! 𝑚𝑓𝑝!

+ 𝜇! 𝑚𝑓𝑝!

(2)

where 𝑚𝑓𝑝! is MFP growth in sector i (including computer hardware, communications
equipment, software, other intellectual property, and all other final demand output),
𝑚𝑓𝑝! is MFP growth in the semiconductor sector, and the µ’s are Domar weights for
aggregating MFP growth rates. We separate the contribution for semiconductors in
equation 2 because, except for net exports, they are intermediate inputs and are handled
differently in the growth accounting equations than are other products that are
components of final demand.
To empirically implement the decomposition of labor productivity in equation 1,
we use Fernald’s data for the business sector. Note that Fernald measures output as an

6

average of gross domestic product and gross domestic income, so the productivity figures
will not match those published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (which rely solely on
gross domestic product).
To empirically implement the MFP decomposition in equation 2, we measure the
sectoral MFP growth rates using the dual approach described in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel
(2013). In the dual approach, the rate of price change for output of a sector (say,
semiconductors) is decomposed as a weighted average of the growth rates of labor costs
and the cost of capital less the growth rate of MFP. The logic is that faster MFP growth
would, all else equal, hold down rates of price change for a sector’s output. Thus, MFP
growth rates can be inferred from relative price changes. We use standard data from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and data on the tech sector
from some other sources. All of our data sources are described in the data appendix to
Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013).
With equations 1 and 2, we have the tools needed to assess the impact of
mismeasurement on labor productivity growth, total MFP growth, and MFP growth in
individual sectors. In particular, we can compare estimates for those measures based on
official measures of high-tech prices and on alternative measures of tech prices that
adjust for likely biases in the official data.

3. Mismeasurement of Prices of High-Tech Products
While official measures of prices point to very slow rates of decline in recent
years, a growing literature indicates that these measures understate the rate of price
decline.5
For example, Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (forthcoming) developed a new index for
microprocessors (MPUs) used in desktop personal computers. Their preferred index fell
at an average rate of 42 percent a year over 2009-2013, while the most comparable
official price measure—the Producer Price Index (PPI) for microprocessors—reports an
average decline of only 6 percent a year.
This measurement gap for MPUs arose in the mid-2000s because of a major
change in the lifecycle pattern of Intel’s posted prices for MPUs.6 Prior to that time,
posted prices of MPUs tended to fall over their lifecycle, and a matched-model index
such as the PPI would rely on those declines to capture quality change. Since the mid2000s, posted prices of Intel MPUs have tended to be flat. Using these relatively flat
price profiles, a matched-model index will indicate little change in quality-adjusted prices
even if quality is improving. Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (forthcoming) developed a
hedonic index that could capture ongoing quality change and generated the more rapid
price declines reported above.
We believe measurement problems also are present for other types of high-tech
products, although the sources of problems differ across products. For computer
hardware, communications equipment, and software, we rely on alternative research
5

See Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2016 and forthcoming), Byrne and Corrado (2016), Byrne (2015a and
2015b), and Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).
6
Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (forthcoming) use posted prices for Intel MPUs because transaction prices are
unavailable. Although BLS does not indicate which prices are included in the PPI for MPUs, we are able
to replicate the trend in the PPI with a matched-model index that uses only Intel’s posted prices.

indexes developed by Byrne and Corrado (2016), which are the series used by Byrne,
Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) in their analysis demonstrating that mismeasurement of
high-tech prices does not explain the mid-2000s slowdown in labor productivity growth.
Byrne and Corrado did extensive work to develop these indexes, and, while additional
research will surely improve on their indexes, their work provides the best available
measures of the amount of bias in official price indexes for high-tech products. Table 1
reports rates of change in official price indexes and the alternative research price indexes
for computers, communications equipment, software, and semiconductors.7 (Note that
the semiconductor index shown in the table is for all semiconductors rather than MPUs,
and it incorporates the MPU estimates described above.)
As shown in the last column of the table, measurement gaps—which equal the
difference between the percent changes of the official price index and the alternative
research index—are sizable for all of the high-tech products shown. Over the period
2004-2015, these gaps range from 5.4 percentage points for communications equipment
to 13.6 percentage points for semiconductors.

4. How Much Does Mismeasurement of Tech Prices Affect Labor Productivity?
To answer this question, we implement the standard growth accounting
framework described above using official price indexes and the alternative research
indexes. For the implementation relying on the alternative price indexes, we make two
types of adjustments. First, we adjust real GDP to account for the more rapid declines in

7

The alternative research prices shown in table 1 are price indexes for output. We use these output price
indexes in all of our calculations with alternative research prices with one exception. The exception is for
estimates of capital deepening in the decomposition of labor productivity. For those calculations we use
Byrne and Corrado’s investment price series as the alternative research index.

9

deflators for final demand of high-tech products. Second, we adjust capital services to
reflect the different trends in real investment in high-tech products arising from the
alternative research price measures.
Results for labor productivity are summarized in tables 2A-2C and figure 1.
Table 2A shows the standard decomposition of growth in labor productivity using official
prices. The figures show the well-known pattern of a pickup in labor productivity growth
in the period from 1995 to 2004, a slowdown after 2004, and then another slowdown
after 2010. The pickup after 1995 reflects a jump in contributions from capital deepening
and MFP growth. The slowdown in 2004 mostly reflects a slowdown in MFP growth.
As Fernald (2014) and others have highlighted, this stepdown occurred prior to the
financial crisis so it is difficult to find its source in the financial crisis and Great
Recession. However, the dropback in labor productivity growth after 2010 was
concentrated in capital deepening. This retrenchment might well reflect effects of the
Great Recession as expectations of weak future demand and heightened uncertainty
restrained business investment.8
Table 2B reports results using the alternative research price measures. The broad
patterns are the same as in the decomposition relying on official price measures. And, as
shown in table 2C, the differences are fairly small between the decompositions using
official and alternative research prices. Although labor productivity growth is somewhat
higher using the alternative research indexes, the contribution of capital deepening also is
8

The figures discussed here follow current U.S. national income accounting conventions, which include
only some types of intangible investment—specifically, software, research and development, and artistic
originals. Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009) argued for the inclusion of a wider set of intangibles as
business investment, including organizational capital, training, product development and design, and
brand equity. Corrado, Haskel, Jona-Lasino, and Iommi (2016) note that business investment including
the full set of intangibles has held up better than has business investment as reported in the U.S. National
Accounts. Accordingly, capital deepening and labor productivity could be stronger than shown in the
official data.

higher. Consequently, switching to the alternative research indexes has a relatively
modest effect on aggregate MFP growth. These patterns also are evident in figure 1,
which shows stacked bar charts for the labor productivity decomposition with both
official prices and the alternative research prices.9
These comparisons confirm the conclusion reached by Byrne, Fernald, and
Reinsdorf (2016) and Syverson (2016) that mismeasurement of tech prices does not
explain the productivity slowdown around 2004. Correcting the likely biases in tech
prices does boost labor productivity by about a quarter percentage point over 2004-2015,
but that correction also boosts growth by similar amounts prior to 2004.

5. How Much Does Mismeasurement of High-Tech Prices Affect MFP Growth?
As noted, correcting the mismeasurement of tech prices has a relatively modest
effect on total MFP growth because the increment to labor productivity growth is not
much bigger than that to the contribution of capital deepening. However, correcting the
mismeasurement of tech prices has a much more dramatic effect on the allocation of MFP
growth across sectors.
For the sectoral decomposition of MFP growth, we use the dual approach to
estimate MFP for each sector, relying on changes in the relative price of output in each
sector to estimate MFP growth.10 This link between price trends in each sector and MFP
growth means that correcting the mismeasurement of tech prices can affect MFP growth
rates. Of course, given the earlier results that switching from official measures of tech
prices to the alternative price indexes had only a small effect on total MFP growth, the
9

Figure 1 reports contributions for aggregate MFP growth without the utilization adjustment.
Details of the dual approach are described in Oliner and Sichel (2002) and Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel
(2013).

10

11

changes in MFP growth rates that we identify largely are to the allocation of MFP growth
across sectors. Our results are shown in tables 3A-3C and in figures 2 through 7.
Table 3A reports our MFP decomposition using official measures of tech prices.
The estimates show the pickup in MFP growth rates across sectors after 1995 and the
widespread slowdown after 2004. After 2010, growth rates stepped down in the hightech sector (with a large dropback in semiconductors), and were little changed outside the
tech sector.
Table 3B shows MFP growth rates based on the alternative research measures of
tech prices, while table 3C shows the difference between growth rates using official
prices and the alternative research prices. As these panels indicate, MFP growth rates for
the tech sectors are noticeably more rapid using the alternative research measures for tech
prices. At the same time, MFP growth rates are slower in the “All other” sector when
using the alternative research prices. Put another way, using the alternative research
series causes a reallocation of MFP growth across sectors, with more rapid growth in tech
and less rapid growth outside the tech sector.
Turning to the details, MFP growth rates in the high-tech sector are higher over
every period when the alternative research prices are used as can be seen in figures 2
through 7. The same story is evident by comparing tables 3A and 3B. And, as shown in
table 3C, the gap between MFP growth rates in the high-tech sector with official and
alternative research prices steps up noticeably after 1995 and increases further after 2010.
Over the period from 2010 to 2015, the amount of mismeasurement for semiconductors
increases dramatically, while the amount of mismeasurement for the other categories of
tech products decreases. This dropback in the amount of mismeasurement for computing

12

and communications equipment partly reflects the jump in mismeasurement in the
semiconductor sector because our model estimates MFP growth in the computer and
communications equipment sectors net of the contribution from semiconductors.
As noted, the use of the alternative research prices reduces the growth rate of
MFP in the rest of the economy (the “All other” sector), with MFP estimated to be little
changed since 2004. This result is, perhaps, puzzling. Is it credible that MFP growth in a
large swath of the economy was essentially flat on average for a decade?11 We believe
several factors may account for this weak performance.
First, it is possible that mismeasurement also is present in final demand prices for
products in the “All other” sector. If inflation is overstated in this sector, then correcting
this mismeasurement would boost real output growth and MFP growth. One area of
possible mismeasurement is related to so-called “factoryless” manufacturing, where a
company’s U.S. establishment provides product designs and maintains control of the
production process by approving inputs and outputs, but outsources the actual fabrication
to a contract manufacturer abroad.12 A key measurement question is, what price deflator
to use for the design, development, and management value added that occurs within the
United States? Currently, that value added is not uniformly included in the
manufacturing sector, and it is not deflated with prices of the products produced by the
company. Thus, for high-tech companies in this situation, much of their U.S. value
added is not deflated with high-tech prices deflators even though the company is
producing high-tech products. Using high-tech deflators for this design and development
work would boost the growth of measured real output, labor productivity, and MFP.
11

Corrado and Slifman (1999) raised a similar question about labor productivity growth in the
noncorporate business sector and in services.
12
See Bayard, Byrne, and Smith (2015) for a discussion of factoryless manufacturing.

13

Another possibility is that the very weak pattern of MFP in the “All other” sector
is correctly capturing economic developments. As highlighted by van Ark (2016), the
U.S. economy could be characterized as in a transition period, in which a host of
technologies are being developed and installed but are not yet generating significant
productivity gains. Put another way, firms may be paying adjustment costs as they begin
to utilize new technologies, as discussed in Basu, Fernald, and Shapiro (2001). More
generally, the historical record suggests that new technologies boost productivity with a
significant lag.13
It also is possible that weak MFP growth across parts of the U.S. economy
reflects a decline in business dynamism. According to an important strand of recent
research, just such a decline has occurred in recent decades.14 And, as noted by Decker,
Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2015), since 2000 this decline in dynamism “has
been accompanied by a decline in high-growth young firms.” Perhaps these forces are
restraining MFP growth.
Providing an explanation of the weak performance of MFP growth in the “All
other” sector is beyond the scope of this paper. That being said, we can easily imagine
that its roots lie in some combination of the explanations given above.

6. Implications of Faster MFP Growth Rates in the Tech Sector
MFP growth rates often are used by macroeconomists as rough proxies for rates
of innovation. Thus, the reallocation of MFP growth rates across sectors suggests that the

13
14

See David (1990).
See Decker , Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2014).

14

pace of innovation in tech sectors has been more rapid than would be inferred from
figures based on official measures of high-tech prices.
We believe that these faster implied rates of innovation in the tech sector are
important for three reasons. First, these results deepen the productivity paradox. If the
pace of innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than implied by official data,
then it is perhaps even more of a puzzle that productivity growth has remained so weak.
Second, as a rhetorical point, we believe that the sluggish rates of high-tech MFP
growth implied by official price measures have improperly supported darker narratives
about future prospects for productivity growth. The apparent weak pace of innovation in
the tech sector provides fuel for the story that little scope remains for the tech sector to
boost aggregate labor productivity growth.
Third, we believe that these faster rates of growth in high-tech could presage a
second wave of higher productivity growth spurred by the digital revolution.15 To make
this argument, we rely on steady-state values from the multi-sector growth model used
above.
Table 4A shows the actual growth in labor productivity and steady-state estimates
of labor productivity growth over the full period from 1974 to 2015. The steady-state
estimates shown—which are derived using the methodology described in Byrne, Oliner,
and Sichel (2013)—confirm that the model fits long trends in the data reasonably well.
As can be seen on the first line of the table, using official prices for tech products, the
model implies steady-state growth in labor productivity of 2.0 percent a year, just about
15

If views were to pivot toward greater optimism, such a shift could, according to Blanchard, Lorenzoni,
and L’Hullier (2017), spur faster growth. Their work provides evidence that the economy’s weak
performance may, in part, reflect a self-fulfilling prophecy in which expectations of sluggish growth in
potential output feed back to weaken actual economic growth.

15

the same as the actual average growth rate over that period. Repeating these calculations
using the alternative research price series, the actual growth rate of labor productivity is
2.1 percent (accounting for the faster price declines of tech products in final demand),
while the steady-state estimate is slightly higher at 2.4 percent.
The question we ask is, how far below its steady-state pace is the recent rate of
increase in labor productivity? To answer this question, we compare the growth rate of
actual labor productivity during 2010 to 2015 to our estimate of its current steady-state
growth rate. To obtain the current steady state, we update the estimates in Byrne, Oliner,
and Sichel (2013) using our best estimate of the current underlying trend in MFP growth
in the “All other” sector and the model parameters that determine MFP growth in the
high-tech sectors.16 In our model, just as in a one-sector Solow growth model, the
steady-state value of labor productivity growth is the sum of steady-state MFP growth,
the amount of capital deepening induced by the steady-state MFP growth, and growth in
labor quality.
Table 4B provides the numbers. Using official prices for high-tech products,
actual labor productivity growth over 2010-2015 averaged just 0.8 percent. This figure is
about ¾ percentage point below our estimate of the steady-state value of 1.5 percent
based on current underlying trends and the official measures of high-tech prices.
The gap between recent actual growth rates of labor productivity and the steady
state based on current underlying trends becomes larger if we use the alternative research
prices. As shown in the lower panel of table 4B, labor productivity growth averaged 1.0

16

Our procedure is to set a lower bound and upper bound for “All other” MFP growth and the many other
parameters of the model. These bounds are set based on the historical and recent performance of each
series. Our estimate of the current steady state is based on each parameter’s midpoint value (between the
lower and upper bounds).

16

percent over 2010-2015 with these alternative prices. The steady-state value using these
prices stepped up to 2.2 percent, boosted by the greater capital deepening induced by the
faster rates of innovation in the tech sector. Thus, using the alternative price series, the
average growth rate of labor productivity over 2010-2015 is about 1¼ percentage points
below its steady-state value. This gap primarily reflects a shortfall in capital deepening
relative to what would occur in steady state.17
We recognize that steady-state values are relatively weak attractors, that
convergence could take a long time, and that some recent work has expressed skepticism
about a revival of investment.18 Nonetheless, we believe that this evidence raises the
possibility that the faster rates of innovation implied by the alternative research price
measures could spur faster labor productivity in the future.19

7. Conclusion
In the recent debate about the labor productivity slowdown in the U.S., Byrne,
Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) and Syverson (2016) showed that mismeasurement of
high-tech prices cannot explain the slowdown. Nevertheless, available evidence points to
considerable mismeasurement of high-tech prices, and this mismeasurement does have
important implications. In particular, the evidence that prices of high-tech products are
falling more rapidly than is reflected in official statistics implies a reallocation of MFP

17

Alexander and Eberly (2016) and Gutierrez and Phillipon (2016) document that the weakness in
investment began in the early 2000s, and both papers explore possible explanations.
18
Fernald, Hall, Stock, and Watson (2017) argue that the actual value of the capital-output ratio currently is
close to its cyclically-adjusted or trend level. However, they also note that the capital-output ratio is less
than the steady-state value implied by standard growth theory, raising the possibility that the ratio has
been pushed down by factors that may recede in the future.

growth across sectors, with faster growth rates of MFP in high-tech sectors and slower
growth rates elsewhere in the economy.
Macroeconomists often use growth rates of MFP as proxies for the pace of
innovation so the faster rates of MFP growth in the high-tech sector indicate that rates of
innovation in the digital economy have been more rapid than implied by official price
measures. We believe this finding is important for three reasons. First, it deepens the
productivity paradox; that is, the recent sluggish rates of productivity growth become
even more puzzling given faster rates of innovation in the tech sector. Second, it raises
questions about the darkened narratives about future prospects for productivity growth
that have been based on the official price measures. Finally, the research price indexes
that better capture the faster rates of innovation in the tech sector provide a reason to be
more optimistic about future prospects for labor productivity growth.
