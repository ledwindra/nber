The 9/11 Dust Cloud and Pregnancy Outcomes: ¸˛A Reconsideration
Janet Currie and Hannes Schwandt
NBER Working Paper No. 20368
August 2014
JEL No. I1
ABSTRACT
The events of 9/11 released a million tons of toxic dust into lower Manhattan, an unparalleled environmental
disaster. It is puzzling then that the literature has shown little effect of fetal exposure to the dust.
However, inference is complicated by pre-existing differences between the affected mothers and other
NYC mothers as well as heterogeneity in effects on boys and girls. Using all births in utero on 9/11
in NYC and comparing them to their siblings, we show that residence in the affected area increased
prematurity, low birth weight, and admission to the NICU after birth, especially for boys.

1. Introduction
The collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City following the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 was the largest environmental disaster ever to have befallen
a U.S. metropolis, releasing a million tons of toxic dust and smoke into the air of lower
Manhattan (Landrigan et al. 2004, Lioy et al. 2002, Pleil et al. 2004). The levels of mutagenic
and carcinogenic air pollutants measured in the aftermath of the WTC collapse are among the
highest ever reported from outdoor sources (Pleil et al. 2004).
Many previous studies have found a relationship between air pollution during
pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes (e.g. Black et al., 2013; Currie, Neidell, and
Schmeider, 2009; Currie and Walker, 2011; Currie, 2011, Graff-Zivin and Neidell, 2013). It is
therefore surprising that the broad 9/11 literature has so far shown little consistent evidence of
effects of in utero exposure to the dust cloud on birth outcomes. Perlman et al. (2011) review
the existing literature and conclude that "proximity to the WTC site on or after 9/11 does not
seem to have increased the risk for low birth weight (<2500 g) or preterm deliveries."
This study reexamines the effects of the 9/11 dust cloud on pregnancy outcomes,
overcoming some of the empirical challenges that have complicated inference about its effects
in previous studies. First, as we will show below, mothers living in the affected areas were
different than other mothers even within lower Manhattan, and were more likely to have had
positive birth outcomes other things being equal. We control for this source of possible
confounding by following the same mothers over time.
Second, there are issues having to do with seasonality and low statistical power in the
small convenience samples that have typically been used to examine the effects of 9/11. By
using all births in the affected area and elsewhere in Manhattan, we can control for the effects

3

of seasonality, and we have larger samples sizes, and thus more statistical power than most
previous studies.
Third, the larger sample size also allows us to estimate effects separately for boys and
girls. Such subgroup analysis might reveal important gender differences as a literature on
"fragile males" has found that male fetuses are more vulnerable to detrimental influences in
utero than female fetuses (Kraemer 2000; Eriksson et al. 2010; Almond and Mazumder, 2011;
Dinkelman, 2013).
We find strong effects of residence in the area affected by the 9/11 dust cloud on
gestation length, the incidence of low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 grams,
hereafter LBW), and whether the infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) after birth. The effects are driven by first trimester exposure and are -- in line with
the literature on "fragile males" -- much stronger for boys than for girls. The estimates are
robust to choosing alternative control areas, to the exclusion of births after 9/11 (so that only
births to mothers pregnant before and during 9/11 are included), and to instrumenting post9/11 area of residence with pre-9/11 residency.
These findings provide the first consistent evidence that the 9/11 dust cloud had
detrimental impacts on pregnancy outcomes. Moreover, our analysis shows that it is the male
offspring of mothers exposed to the dust cloud who bear the major burden in terms of health
effects which reinforces the idea that a gender-specific analysis can be useful when assessing
in utero effects of pollution and other detrimental influences.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 discusses background information about
previous studies of pollution from 9/11 and the greater susceptibility of males to many types
of health insults. Section 3 provides an overview of our data and methods. Section 4 presents
the results, and a discussion and conclusion follow in Section 5.

2. Background
Figure 1 shows aerial photographs of the dust cloud that resulted from the collapse of
the World Trade Center towers. This dust contained a wide range of toxicants and irritants,
including pulverized cement, asbestos, glass fibers, lead, dioxins and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), some of which are known to be hazardous for fetal development, while
the effects of many others are unknown (Pleil et al., 2004). PAHs have been identified as
contributors to adverse birth outcomes in previous research. The PAH air concentrations in
the days after the disaster were among the highest outdoor PAH concentrations ever reported
(1.3 to 15 ng/m³), comparable only to measurements from the Teplice coal-burning region in
the Czech Republic. These initially high concentrations declined rapidly over the weeks
following 9/11 (Pleil et al., 2004).
The collapse of the two towers created a zone of negative air pressure that pushed dust
and smoke into the avenues surrounding the WTC site (see Figure 1). Since the area north of
the WTC was less densely covered by big buildings, much of the heavy dust was pushed
northwards. At the same time wind was blowing from the east from the first hours to 18 hours
after the collapse (Lioy et al., 2002). When the dust particles reached the open area around
Warren Street the wind started dominating the movement of the dust particles, moving them
eastwards. As a result of these two effects the exposed areas include not only the area
immediately adjacent to the WTC, but also the areas north and east of the WTC. High levels
of WTC pollutants were found in dust samples taken from Cherry and Market Streets close to
the Manhattan Bridge (Lioy et al. 2002). Figure 2 shows the Neighborhood Tabulation Areas
(NTAs) 1, the smallest regional areas our data identifies, which were at least partly exposed to
the 9/11 dust cloud. These include Lower Manhattan, Battery Park City, SoHo, TriBeCa,
Civic Center, Little Italy, Chinatown and the Lower East Side.

NTAs are aggregations of census tracts that are subsets of New York City's 55 Public Use Microdata Areas.

Environmental exposure to the WTC dust cloud was associated with significant
adverse effects on the health of adult community residents and emergency workers
(Landrigan et al. 2004). The high alkalinity (pH 9.0–11.0) of WTC dust produced bronchial
hyper-reactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. These health effects are in
line with experimental tests which found that mice exposed to WTC dust showed short-lived
pulmonary inflammations and persistent marked bronchial hyper-reactivity
Previous Estimates of the Effects of Pollution on Newborns and of the Effects of 9/11
While many previous studies have shown that there is an association between air
pollution and negative infant health outcomes, economic studies have focused on determining
whether the effect is causal. Chay and Greenstone (2003a,b) used exogenous variation in
pollution stemming from the Clean Air Acts and economic recession respectively to show that
a one-unit decline in particulates led to 5 to 8 fewer infant deaths per 100,000 live births.
Other studies use naturally occurring variation in pollution and large samples of U.S. siblings
subjected to different levels of pollution in utero (Currie and Neidell, 2005; Currie et al.,
2009) and have found that exposure to carbon monoxide has significant negative effects on
birth outcomes.
Most existing research has focused on the so-called “criterion air pollutants” which are
regulated under the Clean Air Acts and there has been little research on the causal effects of
other sorts of pollutants (such as many of those that appeared in the 9/11 dust cloud). One
exception is Currie et al. (2013) who examine the effects of toxic emissions using openings
and closures of more than 1,600 industrial plants and the universe of birth records from five
large states. They found that living within a mile of such a plant increased the incidence of
low birth weight by 2% relative to infants born 1–2 miles away (where economic benefits of
plant operation can be assumed to be the same as for people living within a mile of a plant).

6

These previous studies suggest that even low levels of pollutants have negative effects
on birth outcomes and that it would be quite surprising if in utero exposure to the 9/11 dust
cloud was benign. Yet this is exactly the conclusion the previous studies have come to. It is
possible that these null results may be explained by methodological limitations in the existing
studies.
Existing studies of the effects of 9/11 on the health of newborns generally recruited
samples of mothers either from individual hospitals in Lower Manhattan and/or via media
publicity (Berkowitz et al. 2003, Lederman et al. 2004, Herbstman et al. 2010, Lipkind et al.
2010). Such recruitment processes might lead to unrepresentative samples, for example if
health problems during pregnancy affect mothers' willingness to participate in such studies. A
further issue is selection of mothers into neighborhoods that were differentially exposed to
9/11 dust. As we show below, the socio-economic status of mothers varies substantially
across different neighborhoods of New York City (NYC). Thus, even if the above mentioned
recruitment methods yielded representative samples, neighborhood differences in birth
outcomes could confound the estimated effects of exposure to the dust cloud.
Our sample is based on the entire population of births in NYC, though in what follows
we focus mainly on births to mothers residing in Manhattan.

In order to control for

differences in the characteristics of mothers across neighborhoods, we follow the same
women over time by including mother fixed effects. These fixed effects control for all
characteristics of the mother that are constant between births.
Using this relatively large sample of births is advantageous in that a larger sample size
implies greater statistical power than many existing studies. For example, Berkowitz et al.
(2003) include 187 births to mothers who were in the vicinity of the WTC at 9am on 9/11.
These mothers were mostly self-referred in response to the researcher’s recruitment. The
comparison group is composed of women delivering in the same time period at Mount Sinai
7

hospital on the Upper East Side. The authors conclude that the incidence of poor birth
outcomes was higher in the treatment group, but it is difficult to assess causality given the
selected sample and a control group with different baseline characteristics.
Many existing studies do not control for the month of conception which is a
potentially strong confounder for 9/11 effects. For example, Eskenazi et al. (2007) examine
birth outcomes in upstate New York and in neighborhoods of NYC excluding lower
Manhattan in the months following 9/11. They compare births in the week after 9/11, as well
as in several later intervals, with births in the three weeks prior to 9/11. They find slightly
elevated rates of low birth weight and premature births in upstate New York and NYC
(excluding lower Manhattan) in the months following 9/11, and suggest that stress is the most
likely explanation of this observed association.
Currie and Schwandt (2013) show using data from New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania, that the composition of mothers who conceive fluctuates strongly over the year
and that the month of conception also affects birth outcomes independently of maternal
characteristics. Since exposure to 9/11 -- especially if analyzed by pregnancy trimester -- is
directly linked to the season of conception, failing to account for seasonal effects could
severely bias estimates. In particular, babies conceived in February through May tend to have
shorter gestation than babies conceived in November through January, suggesting that one
would expect babies born in the quarter after 9/11 to have lower gestation than those born in
the month prior to the attack.
Birth outcomes might also have been affected by 9/11 independent of the dust cloud,
through maternal stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and many of the existing
studies focus on this channel. In an innovative study, Lauderdale (2006) analyses births to
mothers with Arabic names in California and finds that during the 6 months following 9/11
poor birth outcomes were significantly elevated for this group relative to non-Arab named
8

mothers. She argues that Arabic-named mothers suffered particularly strong psychological
stress in the aftermath of the attacks which in turn had a negative impact on their babies.
Lederman et al. (2004) study a total of 300 full-term births at three lower Manhattan
hospitals dividing them into an exposed group (women who lived or worked within 2 miles of
the WTC on 9/11) and an unexposed reference group. They found that the babies born to
mothers in the exposed group were slightly smaller than those born to the reference group, but
found that distance from the WTC had no impact on the estimated effect. Hence, they
concluded that the negative effects were likely due to stress rather than exposure to dust.
Lipkind et al. (2010) compare 446 births to women enrolled in the WTC Health
Registry (large self-referred in response to advertisement) to women residing more than 5
miles from the WTC and do not find any significant difference in birth outcomes. They do
find that women who reported 9/11-related post-traumatic stress disorder had higher odds of
LBW and preterm delivery. However, it is possible that this association is driven by third
factors such as socio-economic status that might be associated with the likelihood of
developing PTSD following the disaster.
Taken together these studies suggest that maternal stress related to 9/11 may have had
detrimental effects on birth outcomes, but this effect is not restricted to mothers residing close
to the WTC. Instead, effects have been detected independently of the region of residence,
including among mothers in upstate New York and in California. In our analysis we compare
mothers in the area affected by 9/11 dust to mothers in the other neighborhoods of Manhattan.
Thus any stress effect that is common to mothers across areas should not result in differential
effects on birth outcomes. In robustness checks we also ask whether the estimated effects
change if only mothers in mid-/lower Manhattan or all mothers in NYC are included in the
comparison group. If a common stress effect is stronger for mothers living closer to the WTC

9

then the estimated effects should be smaller when including only mothers in mid-/lower
Manhattan and larger when the comparison group is all NYC.
Fragile Males
We will show below that the 9/11 dust seems to have had much larger negative effects
on male fetuses than female fetuses. This finding is in line with a broad literature about
“fragile males” in epidemiology and medicine (Kraemer 2000; Eriksson et al. 2010). Fetal
deaths are more common in boys (Childs 1965, Mizuno 2000), suggesting that the same
environmental insults imply greater damage for male fetuses. Lower male to female sex ratios
have been observed for mothers who smoke (Fukuda et al. 2002) as well as for those who
experience psychological stress due to severe life events (such as severe health diagnoses of
family members) or natural disasters during pregnancy (Fukuda et al. 1998, Hansen et al.
1999). Catalano et al. (2005) and (2006) find that sex ratios in California and New York City
respectively were slightly lower in the nine months following 9/11 than during the same
season in the years before and after. They argue that maternal stress related to 9/11 might
have led to more miscarriages for male than for female fetuses. Our estimates of the effects
of exposure to the 9/11 dust cloud on the ratio of male to female infants born is negative but
not statistically significant, suggesting that we may not have enough power to detect an effect
on fetal losses. Aside from fetal losses, surviving male infants suffer higher rates of perinatal
brain damage (Lavoie et al. 1998), cerebral palsy, and congenital deformities (Singer et al.
1968) than female infants when born prematurely.

3. Data and Methods
The birth data for this paper come from individual birth records covering all births in
New York City (NYC) from 1994 to 2004. New York City has its own Vital Statistics
10

Natality system for collecting and recording information from the certificate of live birth.
Data for these certificates come from two worksheets. One is completed by the mother and
asks information about her circumstances and behaviors (such as marital status, smoking
during pregnancy, and pre-pregnancy weight). The other worksheet is completed by the
medical facility where the birth takes place using medical records. This worksheet includes
information about prenatal care visits, risk factors for the pregnancy, complications of labor
and delivery, and newborn health. We start with all live singleton births in New York City
between 1994 and 2004, approximately 1.2 million records.
The data also includes information about the mother’s neighborhood at birth (at the
NTA level) and a code that allows us to match births to the same mother. This data set makes
it possible to overcome the limitations of previous studies of the effects of 9/11 dust exposure
on birth outcomes (see discussion above). Including all births in NYC circumvents sample
selection due to endogenous study participation. Further, identifying births to the same mother
makes it possible to eliminate time-constant differences between exposed and non-exposed
mothers. Third, the large sample size enables us to control effectively for seasonality as well
as to analyze heterogeneity in the effects of exposure by gender and trimester of exposure.
We identify exposure to 9/11 by individual trimester of pregnancy. Babies conceived
within three months prior to 10/2001 were exposed during their first trimester (born 12/20017/2002, in our sample). Conceptions between three and six months prior 10/2001 imply
second trimester exposure (born 9/2001-4/2002). Third trimester exposure applies to all
babies conceived more than six months prior to 10/2001 but born after 8/2001 (born 9/200112/2001).2

2

Birth dates are reported by year and month of birth while gestation is reported in weeks. We
calculate the date of conception by subtracting the number of gestation weeks from the week
(as counted by a running number from the beginning of the sample period) that covers the
15th of the month of birth.
11

Information on the mothers' neighborhood of residence is provided at the date of birth
but not at the date of conception. We use the residence at birth as a proxy for the residence at
conception. In order to assess the precision of this proxy we investigate migration patterns of
mothers in the dust area and the no dust area below. We also test whether mothers giving birth
prior to 9/11 in the dust area are less likely to be observed with an additional birth after 9/11
than mothers in the no dust area, which would indicate that women might have migrated out
of NYC in response to the dust cloud exposure.
As discussed in the previous section we include in the exposure area all neighborhoods
that were at least partly exposed to the 9/11 dust cloud, i.e. Lower Manhattan, Battery Park
City, SoHo, TriBeCa, Civic Center, Little Italy, Chinatown and Lower East Side (Figure 2).
Births in all the remaining neighborhoods of Manhattan form the control area. We explore the
robustness of our results to the use of alternative areas as control groups. For example, we try
assigning the Lower East Side (which may have been less exposed to the dust cloud) to the
control instead of the exposed area. We also try restricting the control area to mid- and lower
Manhattan. And we extend it to include all births in NYC.
We restrict attention to single births with non-missing information on gestation length
and birth weight. These restrictions yield a baseline sample of 1,226,552 births in all of NYC
between 1994 and 2004. Table 1 column (1) shows the means of mother characteristics and
birth outcomes for this sample. One third of mothers are Hispanic, white and black mothers
make about a quarter of the sample each, and the remaining tenth are Asian. Average age is
28 years and almost half of the sample is unmarried; 3.8% of mothers smoke and 64.5% have
a prenatal care visit during the first trimester. The rates of prematurity and low birth weight
are 7.9% and 6.9%, respectively. For about half of the newborns we observe the birth of one
or more siblings in our sample.

12

Our empirical strategy focuses on newborns in utero on 9/11, comparing those born in
the dust and no dust area with their siblings born before and afterwards. In our sample a total
of 112,483 births are part of sibling pairs in which one sibling was in utero on 9/11. Column
(2) shows the mean characteristics of this subsample. Compared to the overall sample,
mothers in the 9/11 sibling sample are more likely to be white and they are slightly younger.
Rates of prematurity and low birth weight are about one percentage point lower than in the
full sample. In robustness checks we present regressions using this overall NYC sample of
9/11 sibling pairs.
Our baseline regression sample, however, is restricted to the subset of these children
whose mothers lived in Manhattan. Columns (3) and (4) show means for this subsample, split
by whether the 9/11 sibling was born in the area affected by the dust cloud or not. A total of
2,290 births were in sibling groups where at least one infant was potentially affected by the
dust cloud while the no-dust sample includes 11,273 births. This total of 13,563 births
constitutes our baseline regression sample. The racial composition of mothers living in the
area affected by the dust is very different from the remaining sample, due to the high fraction
of Asian mothers in Manhattan's Chinatown; 55.3% of mothers in the affected area are Asian,
compared to 6.4% in the other neighborhoods of Manhattan and 10.9% in all NYC. The other
considerable difference is the fraction of mothers with more than 12 years of education which
is smaller in the dust-affected area than in the no-dust area (32.5% vs. 63.1%) but similar to
the rate in all NYC. Maternal behavior in terms of smoking and the number of prenatal care
visits is similar across the dust and the no-dust areas and more favorable than in all NYC. An
important distinction is that rates of prematurity and low birth weight are lowest in the dust
area (5.1% and 3.6%, respectively), followed by the no-dust area (6.2% and 4.5%) and they
are highest in the all NYC sibling sample (6.7% and 5.6%).
Methods
13

Table 1 shows that there are strong socioeconomic differences between mothers who
give birth in different neighborhoods of NYC. One reason mothers select into different
neighborhoods has to do with racial or ethnic clusters such as Chinatown in lower Manhattan.
Another driver might be differences in housing prices and skill-specific labor demand. A
straightforward way to control for time-constant differences in mother characteristics across
neighborhoods would be to include neighborhood fixed effects. However, the selection of
mothers into different neighborhoods might change over time and in response to a disaster
like 9/11. In this case, any changes in birth outcomes within neighborhoods might be entirely
driven by changes in the composition of mothers over time. A way to account for timechanging regional selection is to include observable maternal characteristics in multivariate
regression models. But variables such as age, race and years of education are relatively crude
proxies for the socio-economic determinants of residential sorting and they are unlikely to
capture the entire extent of selection.
To control for both observed and unobserved mother characteristics that are constant
across births (such as maternal background) we include mother fixed effects. This means we
compare siblings born to the same mother at different points in time, with and without
residence in areas exposed to the 9/11 dust cloud. Further, we also include sibling pairs with
the 9/11 sibling born in Manhattan outside the dust area to control for potential effects of 9/11
on birth outcomes unrelated to the 9/11 dust cloud. As discussed above, some papers have
suggested that 9/11-related maternal stress and post-traumatic stress disorders lead to adverse
birth outcomes, irrespective of where in NYC mothers lived (Lederman et al. 2004,
Lauderdale 2006, Eskenazi et al. 2007, Lipkind et al. 2010). Including sibling pairs in
Manhattan outside the dust area controls for 9/11 effects that are common across
neighborhoods.

14

Hence, the design is "difference-in-differences" with mother fixed-effects, comparing
the difference in birth outcomes between sibling pairs with one sibling in utero on 9/11 and
exposed to the dust cloud to the difference between sibling pairs with one sibling in utero on
9/11 but not exposed to the dust cloud. We estimate linear regression models of the following
form
Yi = + Ni*Ti) + Ni +  +  + Xi + i,

(1)

where i indexes the newborn, Yi is a birth outcome, N is an indicator for dust exposed
neighborhoods and T is an indicator variable for pregnancy on 9/11. The vector includes
year and month of conception fixed effects, are mother fixed-effects and Xi are controls for
time-varying maternal and child characteristics that are known to affect birth outcomes
(gender; birth order 1, 2, 3, >3, missing; mom age <20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, >34, missing; an
indicator equal to one if the father information is missing).
Controlling for specific neighborhoods in the dust-exposed area deals with fixed
differences between neighborhoods. Year and month of conception fixed effects control for
time varying characteristics common to births in all neighborhoods and for the effects of
seasonality on birth outcomes. Mother fixed effects capture unmeasured maternal
characteristics that are constant between births. Errors are clustered at the neighborhood-year
level to allow for correlated errors within areas. When including data for all of NYC (and
hence more neighborhoods, i.e. 195 instead of only 29 in Manhattan), we cluster at the
neighborhood level.
The key coefficient of interest is which measures whether infants who were in the
affected neighborhoods at the critical time have worse outcomes. The model can be refined to
estimate effects of exposure by individual pregnancy trimesters.
(2)

Yi = + Ni*T1i)+ Ni*T2i)+ Ni*T3i) + Ni +  +  + Xi + i,
15

where T1i, T2i, and T3i are indicators for first, second and third trimester pregnancy at
9/11/2001. This specification allows us to test whether estimated effects are driven by
particular periods of pregnancy, such as the first trimester, when the fetus may be particularly
sensitive to environmental insults (Lee et al. 2003).
In order to test for differential effects by child gender we further estimate models with
gender interaction terms:
(3)

Yi = + Ni*Ti) + Ni*Ti*boyi) + Ni +  +  + Xi + i,

where boyi is an indicator equal to one if the newborn is a boy. Consequently, measures the
effect of 9/11 dust exposure on girls, while +measures the effect on boys. An estimate of 
that is significantly different from zero thus indicates that there is a statistically significant
difference between the effects of in utero dust exposure on male and female fetuses. As for
the baseline regression equation, this model can be refined to estimate gender differences of
exposure effects by individual pregnancy trimesters.
A further way to test for gender differences is to estimate equations (1) or (2)
separately for boys and girls. Such gender-specific regressions are less restrictive as they
allow all parameters in the model to differ by gender. At the same time they are more
restrictive with respect to the data that is included. Since we control for mother fixed effects,
such separate regressions essentially compare pairs of brothers and sisters, respectively,
excluding mixed sibling pairs from the analysis.
Measurement error
One caveat to our analysis is that we observe mothers' neighborhoods only at birth and
not at the time of conception. Some mothers might migrate to a different neighborhood
between conception and birth and this could be particularly relevant in the aftermath of 9/11.
16

The question is whether and how different potential migration patterns would bias the
estimated effects of the 9/11 dust cloud on birth outcomes? If mothers migrate between dustaffected and no-dust areas independently of the degree to which they were affected by 9/11
then miss-assigning location at the time of conception will attenuate our estimates. Some
treated mothers will be erroneously assigned to the control group and some control mothers
will be erroneously assigned to the treatment group, biasing the difference between the two
groups towards zero. This attenuation bias will be stronger if there is a greater tendency to
migrate out of the dust area among mothers who are more affected, and vice versa.
Figure 3 shows a migration flow chart of all mothers who give birth in Manhattan
during the three years prior to 9/11 and had a further birth anywhere in NYC in the nine
months following 9/11. Almost 80% of mothers who gave birth in the dust-affected area in
the three years prior to 9/11, stayed in the same area for the subsequent birth. Only 3.6%
migrated from the dust-affected area into the no-dust area. For mothers in the no-dust area the
fraction of staying mothers is higher (87%) and the fraction of those migrating into the dust
area is lower (1.1%). This difference in migration rates is due mainly to the fact that the “nodust” area is larger than the area affected by 9/11 dust. If we chose a no-dust area of a similar
size, e.g. midtown and lower Manhattan, then the fraction of staying mothers is 74% and thus
very similar to the dust area (see the Appendix Figure 1 for this comparison).
This analysis indicates that there was less migration out of the affected area of lower
Manhattan than one might have expected, and that the extent of migration was similar to that
in a similarly sized comparison area. Further, only a negligible fraction of mothers switched
between the no-dust area and the area affected by 9/11 dust: Most mothers who moved out of
the area went to one of the other boroughs of New York City. These considerations suggest
that any bias introduced by migration of mothers between conception and birth is likely to be
small.
17

Still, we also present a robustness check that deals with possible endogenous mobility
by focusing on pregnancies in progress on or before Sept. 2011 and instrumenting residence
in a dust exposed area on 9/11. Following Currie and Rossin-Slater (2013), the instrument we
construct is a hypothetical indicator equal to one if the mother would have been exposed to
9/11 dust had she stayed in the first location in which we observed her. This instrument is
highly correlated with actual exposure given that most mothers do not move, and it should
have no effect on birth outcomes over and above the effects of actual exposure. Any fixed
characteristics of mothers correlated with the first place in which we observe them will be
controlled for by the inclusion of maternal fixed effects.3
One remaining potential issue could be that mothers in the dust zone were
more likely to move out of NYC altogether and therefore do not appear in the data set after
9/11. Appendix Table 1 shows that this is not the case. Pre-9/11 children born in the dust area
are as likely to have a post-9/11 sibling in the data as those born in the no-dust Manhattan
area (column 1) or in all of the remaining parts of NYC (column 2).

4. Results
Table 2 shows estimates of the effect of dust exposure on the incidence of premature
delivery. The first column shows the estimate of  from equation (1). There is a 2.2
percentage point increase in the probability of prematurity among infants exposed to 9/11 dust
in utero. This is a large effect relative to the incidence of prematurity in NYC of 7.9 percent.
The second column shows estimates of equation (2), which breaks the estimated effects down
by the trimester of pregnancy when the exposure occurred. These estimates suggest that the

The corresponding first stage equation is: Ni*Ti = + N0i*Ti) + Ni +  +  + Xi + i,
where N0i is an indicator equal to one if the first location in which we observe the mother (at
her pre-9/11 birth) is part of the area later exposed to 9/11 dust. In our data the estimated first
stage coefficient is 0.958 with a standard error of 0.011, indicating that the instrument is
highly predictive.

effect is confined to infants exposed during the first trimester of pregnancy and is even larger
for this group at 6.8 percentage points.
Column (3) of Table 2 shows estimates of model (3) which includes gender
interactions. The estimates suggest that exposure had a much greater impact on male fetuses
(10.4 percentage points) than on female fetuses (3.4 percentage points). Given a baseline
probability of 8.16% for boys, exposure to the dust cloud more than doubled the probability of
premature delivery for that group. Columns (4) and (5) show sibling comparisons separately
for boys and girls. As discussed above, these samples throw out mixed-sex sibling pairs and
compare exposed children only to their unexposed same-sex siblings. These models yield
very similar estimates of a 9.6 percentage point increase in prematurity for exposed vs.
unexposed boys compared to a 4.5 percentage point increase for exposed vs. unexposed girls.
Table 3 shows estimates from equations (1), (2), and (3) where the dependent variables
are gestation in weeks, low birth weight, and an indicator equal to one if the infant was
admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The estimated effects are similar to those
discussed above. When gestation is measured in weeks, 1st trimester exposure to the dust is
associated with a reduction in gestation of a third of a week, and column (3) shows that it is
mostly boys who are impacted. Similarly, there is an increase in low birth weight of 5.0
percentage points among boys, as well as an increase of 7.6 percentage points in the
probability that male infants are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. These effects on
low birth weight and admission to the NICU are large relative to the means shown in Table 1,
representing increases of 79.4% and 90.5%, respectively. Thus, it appears that 9/11 roughly
doubled the incidence of these outcomes among prenatally exposed male infants.

Granted that exposure to the 9/11 dust seems to have had a negative effect on birth
outcomes, it is possible that some of the negative effect is via changes in maternal behaviors
rather than via a “biological” effect of exposure. In order to investigate this hypothesis, Table
19

4 estimates models examining a wide variety of maternal behaviors and conditions that are
noted on the birth certificates. Columns (1) and (2) show that exposure to 9/11 dust had no
effect on whether mothers were married at the time of delivery or on the woman’s selfreported pre-pregnancy weight. Column (3) shows that first trimester exposure negatively
affects pregnancy weight gain if the newborn is a boy, potentially due to the negative effect
on gestational length (-0.51 weeks or -3.58 days , see Table 3).
Column (4) indicates a positive effect of first trimester exposure on hypertension both
for boys and girls. Since inflammation is associated with hypertension, it is possible that this
result captures one of the physiological pathways for exposure to 9/11 dust to affect preterm
birth and other birth outcomes. There is also a slightly significant effect on smoking for thirdtrimester exposure (column 5). This might just be sampling variation, given the large number
of estimated coefficients. Column (6) shows though that women who were exposed during
the first trimester were more likely to have a prenatal care visit in the first trimester
suggesting that perhaps they sought out medical care as a response to the exposure to the dust
cloud. As one would expect, this positive behavioral response does not depend on child
gender which is usually unknown during the first trimester. Insignificant effects for higher
trimester exposure are also plausible, since second or third trimester exposure should not
affect the likelihood that a woman had a prenatal care visit during the first trimester.
All things considered and combined with the previous evidence regarding migration
out of the affected area, there is little evidence of large detrimental behavioral changes in the
mothers who were potentially exposed to 9/11 dust during pregnancy. If anything prenatal
care increases among mothers who were exposed during the first trimester. These findings
lend support to the hypothesis that the negative effects on birth outcomes we observe are
primarily due to the effect of exposure to pollution during pregnancy.
Column (7) shows our estimate of the effect of the 9/11 dust on sex ratios.
Although the point estimate for exposure in the first and second trimesters is negative, neither
20

is close to statistical significance. Thus, unlike some previous research we find no effect on
sex ratios perhaps because fetal death is a rarer outcome than the birth outcomes we examine
and we do not have sufficient power to detect it.

Robustness Checks
Our estimation method relies on comparing mothers in the dust-affected area to
mothers in another “control” area. In order to investigate whether our estimates are sensitive
to the choice of control area, we present estimates based on several alternative choices in
Table 5. The first three columns show models based on a sample in which the lower east side
of Manhattan is moved from the dust to the no-dust category. Since the lower east side was
on the boundary of the affected area, it is possible that not all of it was affected. However,
comparing estimates based on this reclassification to the baseline, which is reproduced in
columns (4) to (6), shows that the estimates are quite similar.
Columns (7) to (9) show estimates restricting the sample to the area shown in Figure 2,
that is, to mid- and lower Manhattan. Again, the estimates are very similar to the baseline.
Finally, the last three columns of Table 5 show estimates using all of New York City (rather
than only Manhattan) as the sample. Once again, the estimates are quite similar to those of
the baseline. We conclude that the choice of control area has very little effect on the
estimates.
Table 6 shows estimates that exclude conceptions that occurred after September 2001.
The rationale for this sample restriction is that if a mother’s health was permanently impaired
by 9/11 dust exposure, then this could have an effect on subsequent pregnancies as well as on
the pregnancies that were in progress on 9/11. Hence, comparing an exposed baby to a
sibling born later might result in an under-estimate of the true health effect. Table 6 shows
that in fact the estimates are larger when babies conceived after September 2001 are excluded,
suggesting that there may indeed have been a permanent maternal health effect.
21

Table 7 continues to focus on the sample of births excluding babies conceived after
September 2001, and implements the instrumental variables strategy described above. The
estimates are a little larger than in Table 6, though the standard errors also increase modestly
so that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the estimates are similar to those in Table 6.

5. Discussion and Conclusions
Previous research into the health impacts of in utero exposure to the 9/11 dust cloud
on birth outcomes has shown little evidence of consistent effects. This is a puzzle given that
9/11 was one of the worst environmental catastrophes to have ever befallen New York City,
and there is a great deal of accumulated evidence that even low levels of pollution are
associated with negative birth outcomes.
Our work suggests a simple resolution of this puzzle, which is that the women who
lived in neighborhoods exposed to the 9/11 dust cloud were quite different than women in
other parts of New York City. In particular, they were less likely to have poor birth
outcomes, other things being equal. When we control for these pre-existing differences by
following the same mothers over time, we find large effects of exposure to the dust cloud.
Another piece of the puzzle falls into place given that there is heterogeneity in the effects: The
impacts are especially pronounced for fetuses exposed in the first trimester, and for male
fetuses. We estimate that in this group, exposure to the dust cloud more than doubled the
probability of premature delivery (which was 7.75% for girls and 8.16% for boys) and had
similarly large effects on the probability of low birth weight and admission to the NICU.
Our work also improves on past efforts by utilizing a relatively large sample of births,
controlling for seasonal effects, and examining the impact of 9/11 on various observable
maternal behaviors, including migration. We find surprisingly little effect on these behaviors
suggesting that the estimated effects of living in a dust-affected area on infant health most
likely reflect a biological response to pollution exposure.
22

One way to assess the size of the estimated effects is to compare the effect of 9/11
exposure to the differences in health at birth between disadvantaged and advantaged mothers.
The first two columns of Appendix Table 2 show mean birth outcomes for unmarried, black
mothers with less than 12 years of schooling (disadvantaged) and for married, white mothers
with more than 12 years of schooling (advantaged). As the comparison of columns (4) and (5)
shows, the estimated effect of first trimester dust cloud exposure on boys is of similar
magnitude to the difference between disadvantaged and advantaged mothers for prematurity,
low birth weight, and NICU admission. In other words, the male newborn of an advantaged
mother who was exposed to the 9/11 dust cloud during the first trimester would have birth
outcomes similar to the newborn of a disadvantaged mother who was not exposed. This
comparison highlights the importance of controlling adequately for the baseline
characteristics of the mothers, in order to uncover the truly detrimental effects of 9/11 on
infant health at birth.
We can also place these estimates in perspective by comparing them to previous
estimates of the effects of air pollution on fetal health. Previous epidemiological studies of
areas with high pollution suffer from some of the methodological weaknesses discussed
above, notably, a lack of controls for possible confounders. One study of the Teplice coal
mining region of northern Bohemia which had high pollution in winter due to both coalburning and atmospheric inversions found that rates of prematurity and low birth weight were
twice as high in Teplice as in a nearby district with much lower pollution levels. However,
the authors note that both the ethnic makeup of the mothers and smoking behaviors differed
between the two regions, which could account for some of this difference (Dejmek, Selevan,
and Sram, 1996).
More recent studies of low levels of pollution also find negative effects. For example,
Currie and Walker (2011) found that the implementation of EZ-Pass electronic toll collections
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania reduced automobile exhaust in the vicinity of high way toll
23

plazas. They find that these reductions in pollution resulted in a 10% reduction in the
incidence of low birth weight and prematurity. In contrast to the relatively small changes in
pollution wrought by EZ-Pass, 9/11 was an environmental catastrophe of unparalleled
magnitude. It seems reasonable then that properly measured, the effects of 9/11 are much
larger.

Notes: Coefficients from mother fixed effects regressions of premature births (gestation<37 weeks) on 9/11 dust
exposure during pregnancy are displayed. Dust exposure is the interaction of pregnancy during 9/11 and birth in
the 9/11 dust area. The 9/11 dust area includes Lower Manhattan, Battery Pk City, SoHo, TriBeCa, Civic Center,
Little Italy, China Town and Lower East Side. 1st trimester dust exposure is the interaction of the exposure
variable with 1st trimester pregnancy during 9/11 (respectively for 2nd and 3rd trimester). "*boy" is the interaction
with child gender. The sample in columns (1) to (3) consists of all sibling pairs born between 1994 and 2004,
with one sibling in utero on 9/11 and born in Manhattan. In column (4) and (5) the sample is further restricted to
brother pairs and sister pairs, respectively. All regressions control separately for pregnancy during 9/11 by
trimester, the dust region, child gender, birth order, mothers' age group, and fixed effects for conception year,
conception month and for each mother. Robust standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the neighborhoodyear level. * Significance level at p<0.10; ** Significance level at p<0.05; *** Significance level at p<0.01.

Notes: Coefficients from mother fixed effects regressions of premature births (gestation<37 weeks) on 9/11 dust exposure during pregnancy are displayed. Dust exposure is the
interaction of pregnancy during 9/11 and birth in the 9/11 dust area. In columns (4)-(12) the 9/11 dust area includes Lower Manhattan, Battery Pk City, SoHo, TriBeCa, Civic
Center, Little Italy, China Town and Lower East Side. In columns (1)-(3) Lower East Side is counted as unaffected area. Regressions in columns (7)-(9) include only areas south
of Central Park, and all areas in NYC in columns (10)-(12). 1st trimester dust exposure is the interaction of the exposure variable with 1st trimester pregnancy during 9/11. "*boy"
is the interaction with child gender. The sample consists of all sibling pairs born between 1994 and 2004, with one sibling in utero on 9/11 and born in Manhattan. All regressions
control separately for pregnancy during 9/11 by trimester, the dust region, child gender, birth order, mothers' age group, and fixed effects for conception year, conception month
and for each mother. Robust standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the neighborhood-year level in columns (1)-(9) and clustered at the neighborhood level in columns
(10)-(12). * Significance level at p<0.10; ** Significance level at p<0.05; *** Significance level at p<0.01.
