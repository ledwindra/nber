LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: 1950-1980

ABSTRACT
The paper stresses the evolutionary and adaptive experience of
Latin American growth between 1950 and

1980,

and provides a synthetic view

by considering the sources of growth within a simple production framework.
Regressions use quinquennial panel data for 18 Latin American countries.

They provide an estimate of the net return to investment, of the elasticity
of output to labor and of the contribution of other variables with
influence on efficiency. The regressions show that Latin American growth
varied systematically with trade performance.

The paper provides information on the effects of inflation upon
per capita income growth in the region. There is a negative correlation: an
inflation rate of even 20 percent reduces the per capita growth rate by 0.4
percentage point, or almost 1.5 percent of the regional mean of 3 percent

growth between 1950 and 1980. This result does not hold, however, once high
inflation observations are excluded.
Finally we call attention to the persistent problems of income
distribution and poverty.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the thirty years between 1950 and 1980., Latin America

experienced rapid growth. During this period, output as measured in adjusted

purchasing power tens, expanded at an annual rate of 5.8 percent, with per
capita increases averaging 3 percent a year. Table 1 provides country detail.
The clear star performer is Brazil, whose share in regional product increased
from less than a quarter to more than a third. At the other extreme are two

groups. One is

the Southern Cone, Argentina, Chile

and Uruguay, whose

1950

leading position in the region was eroded by much less than normal
performance. The other laggards include a variety of smaller countries,
several

in Central America.

The average Latin American record, viewed from immediate post-World
War II perspective, is impressive. The target of the Alliance for Progress,
implemented in 1961, was an annual rate of 2 percent per capita. European per
capita income growth in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution was 1.3
percent from 1850 to 1900 and 1.4 percent between 1900 and 1950. Long term
United States economic growth has been at 1.8 percent.

Yet two factors combine to make the 1950-1980 Latin American growth
performance seem less positive. One is its, dramatic

reversal

in the 1980s.

Latin America has retrogressed in this decade, with product falling at a rate
of 1.4 percent, as recorded in table 1. This is a generalized regional

phenomenon. By 1988, with the exception of Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the
Dominican Republic, per capita CDP had fallen below its 1.980 level, At the

extreme, Venezuela, Nicaragua and El Salvador show levels below those attained
in 1960. The l980s have truly been a lost decade, and one underestimates
earlier achievement.
The second circumstance diminishing the accomplishment from 1950 to
1980 has been the surging performance of the Asian countries. Led by the four
newly industrializing countries of South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Taiwan, but extending to many others, Asia has vaulted ahead in the 1980s at

per capita rate in excess of 5 percent. This contrast has
now been widely interpreted as proving the errors of the import substitution
an average annual

strategy favored by

Latin America through much

of

the post-War period. Two

of

the pillars of that strategy were emphasis upon industrialization through
governmental intervention and barriers to trade.
Commentators have recently argued forcefully against both. Angus
(adison(1985)

contends:

"The economic growth performance of Latin America since 1973 has been
abysmal.. .there has.. .been a certain continuity in economic policy
attitudes since the l930s and the liberal international order which was
created by OECD countries and has influenced policy in Asia has left them
virtually untouched.w
Deepak tal's

(1985)

rejection of state intervention is another that

many now find attractive:

"The most serious current distortions in many developing countries are not
those flowing from the inevitable imperfections of market economy but the
policy induced, and thus far from inevitable, distortions created by
irrational dirizisme.

S

Understanding the post-war experience is thus tmportant for policy
prescriptions that are currently being debated within Latin America. In this
paper we re-examine these three decades to provide a context for discussion of
the future. In section Il, we analyze the sources of growth, stressing the
evolutionary and adaptive experience of the region over these three decades.
In section III, we take a closer Look at the inflationary process within the
region and its determinants. In section IV, we call attention to the grave and
persistent problems of income distribution and poverty that these three

and a

decades of overall growth failed to eliminate. Inequality

international economy did not seem to be a propitious engine of growth. Nor
did the United States place economic development and Latin America high on the
agenda; the Marshall Plan instead gave priority to Europe and the Cold War.

growth through

ways: the specification of macroeconomic

government intervention.

Attention to the foreign exchange constraint rather than savings as
the determinant of growth in peripheral countries was the principal
macroeconomic novelty. In a world where the terms of trade moved against

traditional primary export products,2 domestic production would have to

substitute for non-essential imports, leaving the

foreign

exchange for the

needed inputs. Moreover, while technical progress in agriculture would leave
Labor unemployed, dynamic industry could absorb the growing population with

increasing productivity and incomes. Domestic production required protection

against imports and deliberate bias against exports of resources that move
into industry.

In the microeconomic sphere, there was stress on imperfections and
discontinuities, both of which impeded effective operation of price signals.

Whether in agriculture, where land concentration was notorious, or in industry
where new privileges provided shelter from market forces, the competitive
model was flawed.

These macro- and microeconomic conditions militated in favor of a
strong state presence. Regulation and direction were needed. Development was a
consequence of policy, not a natural evolution. Conscious and comprehensive

planning was desirable; the Economic Coission of Latin America pioneered in

limitations that increasingly impacted upon performance

toward the end of the 1950s. One was deterioration in the balance of trade,

the second was sectoral imbalance, and the third was deterioration of the
public sector accounts.

Protection led to overvalued exchange rates and hence taxes on
exports. The consequence was an eventual reduction in export supply.

Industrialization in turn required increased inputs of capital goods and
intermediate imports. As trade deficits increased, foreign investment became a
critical requirement, not only for its modern technology but also its
provision of foreign exchange. This was an ironic and unanticipated

8

consequence of a strategy deriving its strong political appeal from its
emphasis upon national productive capability.

In sectoral tens, import substitution policies exaggerated
industrial growth at the expense of agriculture, with three consequences.
First, food prices were kept artificially low, benefiting urban incomes at the
expense of rural incomes. Second, relatively capital intensive manufactures
absorbed only a diminishing fraction of the increment in the labor force,

swelling the service sector and placing pressure on government to serve as an
employer of last resort. Third, physical targets dominated cost effectiveness
calculations; it was as though the higher shadow price of foreign exchange
justified any project.
The third disequilibrium was fiscal. As the initial real resources
taxed away from primary exports began to give out, subsidies to industrial
investment had to come from explicit taxes. At the saSe time, government
responsibilities had increased, placing new pressures upon the budget from the
expenditure side. Monetization of the deficit was an irresistable lure and one

with nineteenth century precedent in Latin America. Inflation and need for
stabilization began to Lurk as a problem in several countries toward the end
of the l950s.
These disequilibria were temporarily averted by the Alliance for
Progress. New inflows of official capital simultaneously helped with the

external accounts and public sector deficits, while Pt 480 imports eased
supplies of food. Governments also attempted to correct some of the policy
excesses by more realistic exchange rates and greater promotion of exports.

9

These efforts were not enough. By the mid-l960s, the Alliance was
itself faltering, the victim of changing policy perceptions in the United
States and Latin America alike. Reforms were not easy nor were resources
unlimited. More orthodox policies became the order of the day, frequently
under military tutelage, setting the stage for a new phase of economic
expansion.

The limits of the import substitution strategy were recognized.
Important modifications to commercial policy were introduced in the l960s.
Tariffs were frequently reduced, especially in the highest categories.

and export growth and diversification in the region increased.

At the same time, larger private capital inflows were an option for
which several countries of the region were eligible. From the end of the 1960s
and reinforced by the oil surpluses after 1973. the Euro-dollar market was in

pursuit of new takers and found many of them in the region. Governments could
finance both more imports as well as larger public sector deficits.

Domestic policies tended to retreat somewhat from regulation and
prices were given greater scope to direct resources. Still, the commitment to
industrialization remained. And that meant an intrusive role for the public

10

sector even under the •orthodox policies pursued by military governments. The
Brazilian "miracle" was a clear lineal descendant of import substitution, not
to be confused with an outward orientation. The large domestic market still
dominated production decisions.

This period of adaptation and relatively successful adjustment of
the earlier model (growth rates showed improvement generally and not only in
Brazil) was brought to an abrupt end by the international disequilibrium
ushered in by the oil price rise in 1973.

The post-oil shock experience in the region was substantially
conditioned by mounting indebtedness and deterioration of domestic policy in a

the

external environment. This period saw

expense of a substantial increase in external liabilities.. It saw growing

of oil producers based upon the new greater value of oil in the

ground. Finally, it saw Brazil labor under its progressively larger service
payments and domestic pressures to sustain its exhilarating pace of industrial
expansion. For the region as a whole, output growth slowed in the 1970s, but
remained at satisfactory levels.

The precariousness of the Latin

American economies only became

apparent when a new oil price rise, an abrupt increase in real interest

rates and an OECD. recession coincided in the early l980s. Countries of the

region had

badly

chosen their adjustment style after 1973. It was not simply

that they blindly followed the original import substitution bias of the l9SOs,

11

as Maddison has argued. Rather it was their specially asymmetric opening to
the world economy, featuring vast financial flows with much more limited trade
penetration. And new fiscal distortions reduced the room for maneuver. To make
growth continue in the late 1970s, government deficits were incurred that
could no longer be so easily financed. Stop-go macroeconomic responses could
be found in a much larger number of countries during this period, They were
but prelude to the stop-stop. policies that ultimately came to be necessary in
the 1980s.

Two key results emerge from table 2. First, a straightforward two
factor approach, here labeled neo-classical, is markedly inferior to an
augmented definition of the production function that includes other variables
reflecting the degree of success in integration into the international
economy. Latin American growth required more than increased capital formation.
It also varied systematically with trade performance.

Roth export expansion and the growth rate of imports clearly
mattered. Exports were significant not only for their contribution to
productive efficiency, but also because higher earnings could avert recurrent
stabilization crises with adverse effects on output growth. More novel is the
finding that availability of imports exerted an independent influence. Import
substitution, successfully pursued, required imported inputs. Countries,
unable to obtain them and forced to curtail their foreign purchases
excessively, suffered. This access to imports, both through export earnings
and foreign finance, differentiated the successes from the failures. This is
where Brazil and Mexico diverged from the Southern Cone experience
Second, the evidence in table 2 strongly suggests that three
different sub-periods corresponding to different internal policies and
external conditions can be distinguished. The dummy variables are highly
statistically significant. The differences among these three periods are
clarified in the following three tables. Table 3 summarizes the sources of
growth for the 1950-65 period1 table 4 shows the equations for the decade
1965-75 and table S presents those for 1975-80.

In each period, the augmented formuLation performs much better than
the

neo-classical formulation in its explanation of output growth. In each

period, the interface with the international economy provides essential
information. By contrast, sheer size of the current purchases of the public
sector - -

estimates

of its investment are included in the investment ratio - -

does not seem to matter.
There are also differences between periods. Especially noteworthy
is the increasing contribution of export performance over time. Latin American
exports until the mid-l960s were almost exclusively primary exports. Although
world trade prospered in the l9SOs, it was newly oriented to the exchange of
manufactured products among industrial countries. Primary prices were quite
weak between 1955 and 1965: real export volume growth of S percent per year

until 1963 for all non-oil developing countries translated into growth of
purchasing power of only 2 percent per year. In the following two

periods,

and

especially after the oil, price increase in 1973, export capability played a
much greater part in determining aggregate growth.

At the same time, successful import substitution enabled the larger
and more rapidly growing economies to compress import requirements. After
1975, policy was already consciously addressed to this objective in most
countries of the region, and new protective barriers were erected. In contrast
to the coefficient for exports, imports exhibit a decline in importance in the
last sub-period.

The disaggregation also points to a falling significance of
investment. The estimate of the rate of return declines from not always

17

productive, accumulation of capital under the impulse of increased foreign

savings. Many of the projects were longer term, moreover, and did not have a
principal impact Ln the shorter term. Later adjustment difficulties meant that
much investment never contributed.
The statistical analysis thus confirms an important association

between the level of output growth and successful Latin American integration
into the

international economy.

III. INFLATION

Another special feature of Latin American development is the
ubiquity of

inflation.

Table 6 presents the Latin

American record of inflation

this 30 year period. Two inferences are direct. One is a clear
distinction among countries; the other is the tendency for price increases to
over

accelerate

over time.

Some countries in the region are recurrent offenders, while others,

because

of the discipline of fixed exchange rates, have largely avoided highly

inflationary episodes. Among the former, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay
stand out. The small countries of Central America largely fall into the latter
camp; at an extreme is Panama, without its own

currency issue. Virtually

alone

among countries of the region, Colombia has managed to avoid surges of runaway
inflation while sustaining a moderate average.

With the oil price shock in 1973 came a new set of inflationary
pressures. Higher international prices of imports were magnified by nominal
devaluations in several countries. Despite slower growth, inflation showed a
tendency to increase. But, as Table 6 indicates, much larger effects were to
be felt after 1980. In the midst of real declines in per capita output.
inflation attained much higher levels than ever before in the post-War period.

Structuralisa, the opposing view, maintains that budget deficits
not at the heart of the matter. The basic causes of inflation lie in

supply shortages, bottlenecks and inconsistent claims of different groups in

society trying to get a larger share of the pie. Fiscal and monetary policy
are accommodating. For structuralists, administered controls on prices and

wages become the central component of stabilization policy. This is the only
way to stop inflation.

Both diagnoses of inflation are incomplete and thus their remedies
have consistently failed.4 From the 1950s to the l9BOs Latin America suffered

from the application of numerous stabilization programs.5 These three decades
have seen more inflation acceleration than successful reduction. Within this
period, the most effective deceleration was the Chilean in the l9lOs. it was,
however, associated with special political circumstances and a flawed reliance
on fixed exchange rates that helped trigger a massive decline in income in the
early l9SOs.

The results from stabilization attempts were, in general.

unsatisfactory. Most typically, temporary reductions in inflation and external
deficits were combined with large increases in unemployment and a reduction of
the labor share in output. Pastor's (1987) empirical analysis of the
International Monetary Fund programs in Latin America in the period 1965-81
finds that Fund programs had mixed impacts on growth rates, led to rising
inflation and were associated with declines in the wage share. Equally
important, and for these reasons, the programs could not be sustained in their
implementation. Reaction against the IMP in Latin America has a long history;
it is not aerel.y a product of the debt crisis.

The Brazilian experience in the mid-sixties is now often cited as
an example of a successful orthodox program. There are two caveats. First, it
should be recognized that the stabilization program of mid-1960s in Brazil. was

not strictly orthodox, as it did make use of price and wage policy. Real wages

Stabilization programs were implemented, for instance, in Chile (1956-58,
1973-78), Argentina (1959-62, 1976-78), Bolivia (1956), Peru (1959, 1975-78),
Uruguay (1959-62. 1974-78), Mexico (1983) and Brazil (1964-68, 1982-83).

were supposed to be maintained at their previous average level. Instead they
became the residual factor when inflation proved to be resistant to
application of restrictive fiscal policy. Prices were subject to some controls
as well as held in check by the incentive of favored access to credit. As a
consequence of these efforts inflation did decline between 1964 and 1966; in a
final stage, a further reduction was facilitated by renewed growth and
productivity increases.

Second, there was a high cost borne by the wage earners whose

claim on income helped to make stabilization possible. The objective

is

not only to reduce inflation, but at minimal expense. In this case, the

burden fell not so much upon output as upon

real wages and a deterioration of

the income distribution. Such wage compression was enforced1 as in Chile, by

political repression.

Ramos (1986) offers an excellent guided tour through the ups and
downs of the neoconservative experience in Argentina. Chile and Uruguay.6 What
distinguishes the neoconservative programs in the Southern Cone in the lace
l9lOs from other orthodox programs is the reliance on the exchange rate to
achieve disinflation. The neoconservative approach is based on global

monetarism.

This theory maintains that a fixed exchange rate determines the

prices of tradables and becomes the central price around which price
expectations can be formed. A fixed exchange rate is thus

program.

Theory diverges from practice because of significant lags and a
limited degree of Import competition. So long as there is inflation inertia.
non-tradable prices are not frozen and domestic tradable prices are not set by
international prices, overvaluation will occur. Overvaluation in turn implies
large current account deficits and stimulates capital flight. The accumulation
of debt, and its service, becomes so great as to force a policy reversal. An
inevitable devaluation provokes another round of inflation.

The Argentine experience is prototypical. At the beginning of 1916
in Argentina. inflation had reached 400 percent when, once again, the military
took power. Martinez de Hoz was in charge of the economic team for five years.

6 See also the special issues of Ecncmic Develornent and Cultural Chanee
(1986) and World Develooment (1985).

23

The first phase of the disinflation program relied on wage controls. At the
sane time, the fiscal deficit was gradually reduced. These policies brought
about favorable results on the inflation front. In December 1978, a new pricestabilization program was instituted. The resultant reduction of inflation was

bought at the price of a huge overvaluation. By 1981, the overvaluation had
precipitated massive capital flight and external debt. The collapse of the

exchange

rate that followed brought about a new inflationary surge. Using the

exchange rate as a principal tool to combat inflation can lead to highly
unstable

outcomes.

The most recent experiences of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico in the
1980s afford an interesting continuity despite their new dimension of a large
external debt.

They help underline the key role played in Latin American

inflation during the last thirty years by the external balance. Just as output
growth in the region must take into account external integration, so must the
circumstances of internal macro-economic disequilibrium. Easily financed

current account deficits made for relatively low inflation. Balance of
payments crises translated into higher interest rates and credit rationing as
well as inflationary pressures generated by realignment of exchange rates.

What counts is not only the size of the public deficit but the capacity to
finance it. In the l980s, one sees the salience of this point in the context

of

increasing debt service. Countries financed the purchase of foreign

exchange not through taxes but by issuing domestic debt or printing money. As

a consequence, inflation rates more than doubled in the l9BOs. (See table 6).

24

A second aspect of Latin American inflation is the prevalence of

indention. The pervasiveness of high inflation has created mechanisms of
institutional defense. All key prices in the economy -

interest rate and wage rate -

- tend

- the

exchange rate,

to have automatic adjustments in response

to price level changes. Indexing averts the large changes in relative prices

that typically occurred in the l9SOs in Latin America. It does so, however, at
the expense of building additional rigidities into inflation and making
disinflation, particularly front high levels, virtually iwpossible under

orthodox programs. Inertia matters.
But the special kind of incomes policy established by indexing is

also far from neutral. Certain groups benefit and others lose depending upon
the choice of index and the degree to which adjustment is forward or backward
looking; a special case earlier discussed was Brazil in the aid-1960s,
lieterodox programs which take the current relative prices as equilibrium
because of high inflation can err. Return to an average real wage will, not

necessarily prove a guarantee that structural and distributional components of
inflation are eliminated. Incomes policy has to do more than coordinate the
responses of different price setters.
table 7 provides information on the effects of inflation upon per

capita income growth in the region. The regressions use quinquennial panel
data for 17 Latin American countries.7 For the period as a whole, there is a

negative correlation. This result is replicated for each of the sub'periods,
with the coefficient beinè largest and most statistically significant in the
interval 1950-65. The average impact is not trivial: an inflation rate of even
20 percent reduces the per capita growth rate by 0.4 percentage point, or
almost 15 percent of the regional mean of 3 percent growth between 1950 and
1980.

This result does not hold, however, once high inflation
observations are excluded. (See lower panel of table 7). If the sample is
limited to all. 5-year averages less than 50 percent, there is no systematic

effect of inflation upon growth. And in the period 1965-75, the effect is
actually positive, reflecting the degree to which spreading indexing

facilitated

adaption to inflationary pressures of modest levels. The

appropriate conclusion, therefore, and consistent with the experience after
1980, is that moderate inflation was not a serious handicap, but that much

rates of 20 to 30 percent a month, one

higher

rates exert a palpable cost. At

cannot

avoid a high degree of variance in relative prices and attendant

uncertainty, not to speak of instability.
Much of the empirical analysis of Latin American inflation in
recent years has been in test of the implications of rational expectations
theory for the effects of unanticipated money growth on real output growth and
the price level. Conclusions have not been uniform, but are sensitive to model
structure, country sample and period of observation. A recent study by
Canarella and Pollard (1989) explores the relation between-money, the price

26

level and growth in 16 Latin American countries between 1950 and 1983. While
the empirical results conform broadly to the view chat unanticipated money
growth has positive effects on output and negative effects on the price level,
they are hardly decisive. Consistent with our emphasis upon external factors,
the coefficient on money growth is generally not of unitary elasticity as

predicted. The pattern of output response, moreover, is qutte sluggish and
highly variable across countries; the price level effect is equally far from
uniform, nor are the cumulative coeficients consistent with those in the
output equation.

While at one time struccuralists were prone to argue in favor of a
favorable inflation-output relationship in the region, few defend such a
poeition at the exaggerated rates now being recorded in many of the countries

of the region. More sophisticated financial markets registering daily
expectations and indexing at more and more frequent intervals leave little

scope for unanticipated price increases, let alone a positive impact. The old
debate between monetarists and struccuralists has given way to generalized
recognition of the need for better macro•econoaic policy and return to much

lower inflation rates

Who are the poor?

Altimir
Latin American

<1982) develops a widely used definition of poverty for ten

countries

in the 1970s on the basis of

available household

surveys and population censuses. His poverty lines (annual household
consumption per capita ranging frois 150 to 250 dollars of 1970) are country

specific based on the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet multiplied by two.

According to Altimir's estimate, in 1970, 40 percent of Latin American

households

were poor end had an average purchasing power from 40 to 55 percent

the poverty line. Only in Argentina the income gap was as low as 25
percent. The extent of poverty was higher in rural than in urban areas in all

below

Latin American countries. Even in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, the most

heavily urbanized countries in the region, the extent of rural poverty was not

less

than 20 percent of rural households. In Mexico, the three bottom deciles

of the income distribution were entirely rural. In Brazil, 70 percent of the
lowest four deciles in the mid-1970s were rural households. The poorest are
usually landless laborers who purchase all or a large part of their food. In
the urban areas the poorest are self employed (rather than wage earners),
workers in construction (the most likely entry point for immigrants) and
persons working in public make-work programs such as those in Chile.
In 1970, the extent of destitution (risk of severe nutritional
deficiency) varied quite substantially from 1 percent of the population in
Argentina to 45 percent in Honduras. About one fifth of all, households in

Latin America had incomes that were insufficient to pay for an adequate diet.
Xusgrove's (1985) study of nutrition in 10 Latin American cities in 1966-69
confirmed

the high levels of destitution poverty, ranging from 18 percent in

Caracas to 56 percent in Quito. Table 8 shows different estimates of the
percentage of population living in poverty in 1970 for 12 Latin American

countries,
The basic survey data from which the indices of poverty are drawn
present many problems. These surveys undercount disproportionately poor groups

and those in surveys underreport their incomes (as shown by comparisons with
independent sources of data). One
measurement

therefore

has more confidence in the

of trends than in figures for any one year. Molina (1982)

published an update of Altimir's work, based on the assumption that poverty
lines grew at one-fourth the rate of average income i,n any country. Despite

considerable

growth in the 1970s, the consequences are disappointing. Table 9

shows only a slight drop in the percentage of the population living in poverty
in most countries in 1981 compared to 1970. with substantial progress in
Brazil and Mexico. Because of their weight in regional total, the incidence of
poverty in Latin America dropped from 39 percent to 35 percent. Nonetheless,
the numbers of poor increased.
Although the number of poor increased, they undoubtedly saw some
improvement in their standard of living between 1950 and 1980 as health and
schooling improved. Growth of the urban population brought expanded
opportunities. Life expectancy in Latin America increased from 55 years in
1960 to 63.7 years in 1980 and infant mortality declined 107 per thousand to
69 per thousand. Access to literacy rose. The data in table 10 show a strong
positive correlation between incomes per head and life expectancy, as well as
between incomes per head and life expectancy. There is no correlation between

tncoaes per

head and infant mortality

rates.

Aggregates may overstate. Merrick (1989), for instance, asserts the
existence of a dual population structure in Brazil. He shows a modem
demographic elite passing through the mortality transition and into controlled
natality at a pace similar to late industrializing societies. This southeast-

urban sector coexists with the northeast-rural sector where high fertility and
mortality rates correspond to the level of traditional underdeveloped
societies.

Relative shares of income also count. They are relevant not only to
issues of equity, but to the assessment of policies to overcome absolute
poverty. Average income per capita in most Latin American countries exceeds
chat in the majority of African and Asian countries1 yet extreme poverty

persists as a result of unequal income distribution. In the Latin American
context it is impossible to look at poverty without considering redistribution
as a potential solution.
Table 11 presents the share of the richest quintile as a multiple

of the poorest quintile, as well, as Cmi

indices

for 13 Latin American

countries. The levels of inequality depicted 'by these indices are striking as

they exceed those found in most other parts of the developing world. There is
little indication that the situation has much improved after 1970. Moreover1

there is reason to believe that the l980s has shown an increased share of
income going to capital and declines to labor, thereby leading to further

deterioration. While efforts to eradicate absolute poverty appear feasible in
resource cost1 although difficult to implement, relative inequality may prove

much more stubborn. From the standpoint of politics, extreme relative
inequality may create a

discontent that hampers effective economic policies.

What can_be done?
Between the l9SOs and 1980s different strategies to attack poverty
became fashionable. From an emphasis upon economic growth, focus shifted to
the basic needs approach and now back again to the belief that only growth can
reduce poverty. But despite the limited aggregate resources needed to reduce

destitution poverty, projects have failed successfully to target the poor.
They have increased as fast as population. And the promise of growth has given
way to a lost decade of development in the 1980s.
Peasant leaders and leftist politicians claim that land reform is

the solution to poverty and inequality in the rural areas of Latin Merica.
-History shows that it succeeded politically only when imposed by revolutionary

governments committed to breaking the power of the landed oligarchy. But in
four countries in the region where it took place (Mexico, Cuba, Peru and

Nicaragua) it achieved neither social justice nor economic efficiency. The
Bolivian outcome seems to have been somewhat more successful. Agrarian reform
has tended to recede as an option since the Alliance for Progress, in favor of

urban migration and

agricultural

credit as a solution to rural poverty.

consequences. These are deceptive. One

valid conclusion

from the

Latin American experience is that government ordered nominal wage increases as
a tool of redistribution do not work.

Direct transfers have a big advantage: they directly benefit the
poor. Their limitation derives from the difficulty of targeting and the

37

absence of a vocal constituency. The poor are seen as undeserving of special
efforts and there is concern that no permanent gains will be realized. The
fiscal constraint faced by most Latin American governments precludes much
advance on this front. Indeed there has probably been retrogression as
expenditures in behalf of the poorest may have suffered proportionally larger
cuts.

Changing the characteristics of the poor remains the most appealing
strategy because it removes one of the most important causes of poverty. The
most general characteristic of the poor in Latin America is an inferior
educational background in both formal schooling and skills training.

There

are significant externalities for growth itself from

expenditures on publicly provided education and health services. Primary
education is an important means for raising productivity and hence growth.

This also holds true for health expenditures. Correa (1970) has argued that
improvements

in health and nutrition added 0.12 to 0.93 percentage points to
-

the rate of economic growth in nine Latin American countries between 1950-62.

Norman Hicks (1980) has estimated that a 10 year increase in life expectancy
raises per capita CD? growth rates by 1.1 percentage points and a 10

percentage points increase in literacy rates raise per capita GD? growth by
0.3 percentage point,. David Wheeler's (1980) findings indicate significant
impact on growth rates from increases in calorie intake and in literacy rates.

Robin Morris's (1982) study found that primary education enrollments had a
favorable effect on growth race, of per capita income.

38

In the end, the stark poverty and income distribution problem in
Latin America measure the failure of the post-War development process. No
exclusive strategy can work. Restored economic growth, more attention to
absolute poverty and basic needs as well as a continuing commitment to
increased capability and mobility are necessary. As significant as technical
design is the inability politically to reconcile attention to poverty and
inequality with policies that sustain macro-economic equilibrium and economic
growth.

V. CONCLUSIONS
Latin America now faces the 1990s. The experience during the thirty
years from 1950 to 1980 provides bases both for optimis. as well as caution.
Countries in the region have demonstrated a capacity for sustained expansion
at relatively high rates over an extended period of time. In so doing, they

have also demonstrated a degree of adaptability and pragmatism. Ideology has
not dominated economic policy-making over extended periods in the face of poor
performance -

On the debit side, countries have failed to establish a record of
credible and consistent policy. The public sector stands out as a major
weakness. Instead of a progressive strengthening, one sees accelerating
debility in many countries. Recovering the ability to lead the development

process is necessary but not easy. Several political leaders have tried
without much success, as inflation barometers sadly register.

than cooperative solutions. The proliferation of capital flight creates even
more diversity of interest and unequalizing claims on wealth.
Technocratic solutions, predominant in many countries from the mid-

l960s, do not seem to be an answer that will hold in the future. For one, in
many instances it was the technocrats that papered over the fragilities of the
1970. and provoked a much worse reaction in the 1980.. For another, the
opening of politics precludes such a reversion. Instead one will have to rely

on more limited areas of regulation and intervention and more decentralization
and use of .arket signals. Perhaps by focusing on social policy1 the great
failure of growth until now, arid by providing scope for more, but not

exclusive, private initiative, a more appropriate Latin American model will
begin to unfold.
