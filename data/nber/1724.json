This research design is applied to the case of Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners, a revolutionary innovation in medical technology. The econometric procedure centers on the estimation of a discrete choice model (the nested multinominal logit), that yeilds the parameters of a utility function defined over the-changing-quality dimensions of the innovative product. The estimated flow of social gains from innovation is used primarily to compute a social rate of return to R&D, to explore the interrelation between innovation and diffusion, and to trace the time profile of benefits and costs, the latter suggesting the possible occurance of \"technological cycles\".\n\n",
