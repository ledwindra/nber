    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper provides a choice theoretic, general equilibrium\naccount of the balance of payments adjustment process and the determination\nof national price levels in a world comprised of countries populated by\nrational households. Balance of payments adjustment dynaniics arise in the\nequilibrium of this model from the precautionary saving behavior of risk-\naverse households who self-insure against random productivity fluctuations\nby accumulating, via balance of payments surpluses in productive\nperiods, buffer stocks of domestic money which can be drawn down to finance\npayments deficits, and thus a less variable profile of consumption relative to output, when productivity is unexpectedly low. Precautionary saving is shown to exhibit the\npartial-adjustment-to-target behavior typically postulated in the monetary approach literature. The existence of a rational expectations equilibrium in which the distribution of international reserves among central banks is stationary is established.\n\n",
