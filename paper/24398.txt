The Efficiency and Sectoral Distributional Implications of Large-Scale Renewable Policies
Mar Reguant
NBER Working Paper No. 24398
March 2018
JEL No. Q4,Q5
ABSTRACT
Renewable policies have grown in popularity across states in the US, and worldwide. The costs
and benefits from renewable policies are unevenly distributed across several margins. The
incidence of alternative designs varies substantially across producers and consumers, across types
of producers, across types of consumers, and across regions. In particular, the efficiency and
distributional implications of large-scale policies crucially depend on the design of wholesale
policies and how targets are set, but also on how the costs of such policies are passed-through to
consumers. Given that renewable costs are mostly non-marginal, due to the large presence of
fixed costs, there are many different ways to implement these policies on both the environmental
design and retail pass-through margins. Using data from the California electricity market, I
develop a model to illustrate the interaction between large-scale renewable policies (carbon taxes,
feed-in tariffs, production subsidies and renewable portfolio standards) and their pricing to final
consumers under alternative retail pricing schemes (no pass-through, marginal fees, fixed flat
tariffs and Ramsey pricing). I focus on the trade-off between charging residential versus
industrial consumers to highlight tensions between efficiency, distributional and environmental
objectives.

Introduction

Large-scale renewable policies have become ubiquitous in the United States and elsewhere. While most policies share the common pursuit of encouraging investment in renewable resources (mostly wind and solar),
their implementation can vary substantially across jurisdictions. Among common designs, some countries
have opted to provide feed-in tariffs to renewable producers, which offer guaranteed retribution for renewable generation at regulated rates. Others offer a complement or a subsidy to the wholesale electricity market
price. Some markets have opted for market-based solutions, establishing targets in the percent of renewable
generation, with renewable portfolio standards (RPS). Finally, some countries have also established carbon
prices. While not specifically targeted to renewable generation, carbon prices can also encourage investment
in cleaner technologies.
In this paper, I study the efficiency and distributional impacts of alternative large-scale renewable policies in wholesale electricity markets. I focus on the trade-off between their efficiency as a mechanism to reduce green house gases (GHGs), and their incidence on consumers and producers. While cost-effectiveness
is an important dimension when evaluating renewable policies (Fell and Linn, 2013), their distributional
implications are also an important dimension to consider (Goulder and Parry, 2008).
Carbon taxes can be the efficient mechanism to reduce GHGs at their optimal Pigouvian level. However, they tend to increase electricity prices. Such price increases have often generated windfall profits for
incumbent producers, specially if implemented as a cap-and-trade program with grandfathered permits, and
represent a rent transfer from consumers to producers.1 Renewable subsidies, on the contrary, tend to depress wholesale prices, by stimulating entry from cheaper sources. Such entry can potentially generate a
transfer of rents from traditional producers to consumers.2
Simulation studies looking at the impact of large-scale renewable policies often assume final consumers
face real-time wholesale prices, which tend to increase under carbon taxes but fall in the presence of renewable subsidies (Fischer and Newell, 2008; Palmer et al., 2011; Fell and Linn, 2013; Wibulpolprasert,
2014). In the absence of explicit charges to final consumers, the costs of subsidizing renewable investments
can be seen as a fixed cost that may be recovered in a lump-sum fashion, e.g., by raising taxes elsewhere in
the economy. Yet, in practice, final prices to consumers can differ substantially from wholesale prices, and
often include renewable charges at the margin. Indeed, as discussed in Borenstein (2016), the recovery of
fixed costs by utilities is a growing problem and it often involves distorting retail prices.
The contribution of this paper is to extend simulation models to account for retail design. I examine how
retail design interacts with alternative environmental policies, and can change or revert some of the results
under wholesale pricing. A broad take-away is that the efficiency and distributional effects of large scale
renewable policies depend substantially on the interaction between renewable policies and the retail tariff
design, and therefore one cannot separate retail pricing from wholesale renewable policy design.
I build an electricity investment model with competitive entry by natural gas, solar and wind produc1

For example, Fabra and Reguant (2014) document a high degree of pass-through of carbon costs to electricity prices in the
Spanish electricity market, which generated substantial windfall profits for incumbent producers and a substantial increase in the
costs of electricity for final consumers.

For example, Liski and Vehviläinen (2016) document that renewable subsidies have reduced electricity costs in the Nordic
electricity markets, largely benefiting renewable producers and consumers.

ers. New entrants come into the market until they break-even. At each hour, the market clears by equating
demand and supply, determining the electricity wholesale price. To quantify the interaction between environmental policies and retail design, I use data from the California market between 2011-2015. Demand
and price data are used to calibrate demand from the three consumer types. Power plant data are used to
calibrate the supply of existing generators. Engineering cost estimates and renewable output data are used
to calibrate capital costs and relative performance of new investment (natural gas, wind and solar).
In the baseline model, consumers pay the wholesale price of electricity and there are no environmental
policies. I then consider four environmental policies: a carbon tax, a feed-in-tariff, and a renewable portfolio
standard. Environmental policies affect wholesale prices, by increasing producers’ marginal costs in the case
of a carbon tax, or by reducing renewable marginal costs due to the presence of a subsidy. Given the partial
equilibrium nature of the exercise, I focus on the case in which renewable subsidies are raised through
retail tariffs explicitly, by increasing charges to final consumers within the electricity market. I allow for
environmental policies to impact retail prices, either as part of the policy design (e.g., as in the case of
renewable portfolio standards), or indirectly as a way to raise the revenue necessary to fund the cost of the
environmental policy (e.g., to pay for renewable subsidies).
I consider three alternative retail tariffs: flat tariffs high enough to recover the additional renewable
policy costs, wholesale real-time prices plus a marginal renewable charge that ensures cost recovery, and
Ramsey prices that are constant but can differ across customer classes (residential, commercial, and industrial). It is not uncommon to see renewable or environmental charges being differentially charged to
residential vs. industrial customers, raising questions about the distributional implications of such burden.
I explicitly consider mechanisms that differentially charge consumers in different classes, analyzing the
merits of such practicies from an efficiency and distributional point of view.
There are several take-aways that arise from the simulation results. First, in line with the literature,
carbon prices are substantially more efficient at reducing green house gases than explicit renewable policies,
in the absence of additional justifications to fund renewable investments. Holding emissions reductions
constant at 10%, average abatement costs are in the order of $12/ton for the case of a carbon tax, but they
are up to $78/ton for the case of RPS and close to $185/ton for the case of a feed-in-tariff. The advantage
of the carbon tax is due to two main channels: natural gas has a substantial cost advantage when compared
to renewable generation in the baseline simulation, and carbon taxes also engage demand response as they
signal the externality at the margin. As a potential drawback, consumers particularly suffer from a carbon
tax. Producers, specially of hydro and nuclear, are the clear winners. That said, such transfer of rents can
be partially mitigated with the use of revenues from carbon taxes, although such rebating undermines the
environmental objectives if performed at the margin.
Second, renewable policies are substantially more cost effective if its associated renewable payments are
reflected in retail prices. In a context like renewables, most of the cost is fixed, thus typically passing-through
costs at the margin in inefficint. However, such charges help circumvent a major limitation of renewable
policies: they do not explicitly price the externality coming from pollution, and might artificially depress
wholesale prices.3 If renewable costs are priced into retail tariffs, I find that the performance of alternative
3

Accounting for the additional benefit of avoiding distortionary taxes elsewhere in the economy reinforces this result.

mechanisms (feed-in-tariff vs. RPS) is comparable, with average abatement costs around $78/ton, although
still less efficient than a carbon tax. The distributional implications on the producer side are still substantially
different between renewable policies and carbon taxes, with renewable producers being the clear winners,
and pre-existing generation suffering from the still artificially low wholesale prices.
Third, when looking at alternative retail tariffs, I find that Ramsey prices do not maximize welfare when
accounting for the presence of a pollution externality, as highlighted also by the transportation literature
(Oum and Tretheway, 1988). Ramsey prices that maximize welfare in the electricity market do not account
for the cost of the externality, as the wholesale price signal is distorted in the absence of a carbon tax. In fact,
I find that recovery under Ramsey pricing is less efficient than a simpler flat rule. Even though increasing
retail rates more steeply to residential customers can be justified due to their more inelastic demand, the
implicit transfer to industrial customers hampers their incentives to reduce demand. Given that industrial
customers are the most price sensitive consumers, such implicit reward reduces demand reductions as a
source of emissions abatement. Importantly, this result is subject to the assumption that electricity reductions in the industrial sector are one-to-one associated with emissions reductions. If one instead assumes
that emissions in the industrial sector would leak, due to self-generation or relocation of production, then
passing-through renewable charges only to residential customers can be more efficient. The result highlights
the importance of addressing leakage concerns in the industrial sector if the industrial sector is expected to
contribute with emissions reductions.
Related literature. Several papers have examined the distributional and efficiency impacts of energy and
environmental policies.4 Bento et al. (2009) examine the de distributional and efficiency impacts of gasoline
taxes, using a structural model of household car choice. Borenstein and W. Davis (2012) examine the impacts of energy tax credit using tax return data, finding that they are substantially more regressive than other
policies. Böhringer et al. (2012) focus on the equity implications of alternative ways to regulate emissions
leakage. Borenstein and Davis (2015) and Borenstein (2015) study the distributional implications of clean
energy U.S. tax credits and solar PV subsidies in California, respectively. Feger et al. (2017) also examine the distributional implications of rooftop solar, but in the context of Switzerland, and compute optimal
tariffs to attenuate distributional impacts. Different than these papers, I focus on the more aggregate tradeoff between different customer classes, and abstract away from redistributional issues within the residential
sector.
A large literature examines the impacts of environmental policies in a general equilibrium setting, taking
into account the impacts of environmental regulations on several sectors of the economy Fullerton and
Heutel (2007, 2010) present a theoretical model to study the impacts of environmental taxes and mandates.
Goulder et al. (2016) examine the impact of federal clean energy standards, and highlight its potential
advantage over carbon taxes in the presence of pre-existing distortions in capital markets. Rausch et al.
(2011) present a general equilibrium model of the United States with detailed household level data to study
the impact of alternative carbon pricing schemes on income groups. I abstract away from these important
general equilibrium issues by focusing on the case in which revenues for renewable subsidies are raised

within the electricity sector.
The modeling approach is closest to the literature examining the design of environmental policies in the
specific context of electricity markets Fischer and Newell (2008); Palmer et al. (2011). The model that I
develop is closely related to Bushnell (2010). The environmental policies I consider follow Fell and Linn
(2013), to which I add retail tariffs and customer classes. The paper is also closely related to Bushnell
et al. (2015), who build a model of the Western interconnection to understand the impacts of the EPA’s
Clean Power Plan, emphasizing the distributional implications between consumers and producers, as well
as different regions within the interconnection. In recent work, Abrell et al. (2017) explore the impact on
retail prices from renewable policies in Germany and Spain, using also a supply model with retail pricing.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 motivates the importance of understanding the interaction
between renewable policies and retail design, with a discussion about their efficiency and distributional
impacts. Section 3 presents the model used to simulate alternative policies. Section 4 presents the data used
to calibrate the model. Section 5 presents the main results, and Section 6 concludes.

Context and Motivation

2.1

Large-scale renewable policies

Large-scale renewable policies can take many forms. I consider four of the main large-scale renewable
policies that are used in practice to incentivize renewable production:5
1. Carbon tax. It taxes CO2 emissions from polluting resources, such as gas and coal. Albeit not
explicitly a renewable policy, it taxes other technologies that compete with renewable generation,
making them more attractive at the margin.
2. Feed-in tariff. It guarantees a flat price to renewable technologies per MWh of production, usually over a long period of time, potentially with a changing tariff over time and targeted to specific
technologies.
3. Production subsidy. It provides a complement to the wholesale price per MWh to renewable generation, often also targeted to specific technologies.
4. Renewable portfolio standard (RPS). It requires retailers to procure a certain share of their electricity from renewable sources. Firms can trade renewable electricity certificates (RECs) to ensure their
compliance with the target.
Note that there are also renewable policies that directly encourage investment, e.g., through Production Tax
Credits (PTCs) or Investment Tax Credits (ITCs), and which are often targeted to specific technologies.
5

These alternative policies follow Fell and Linn (2013) closely.

5

While not the focus of this paper, I take ITCs as given in the empirical model, as a complement to the above
policies.6
With the exception of carbon taxes, most renewable policies incentivize renewable generation explicitly,
instead of taxing the pollution externality. Therefore, when looking at wholesale electricity prices, many
renewable policies have an effect of depressing wholesale marginal prices, in spite of increasing total production costs. Previous research has emphasized the negative effect of depressed electricity prices, which is
counter to the environmental goal of reducing emissions. However, their impact on final prices is less clear,
as it depends on whether renewable prices are passed-through at the retail level.
Table 1 provides a summary of alternative policies, and their impacts on wholesale and retail prices. A
carbon tax will tend to increase wholesale prices. On the contrary, the other policies will tend to reduce
wholesale prices.7 Does this mean that end consumers will face lower prices at the margin? The retail
impacts can be quite ambiguous, and they will depend heavily on tariff design. By default, the carbon tax
and the RPS design will impact retail prices, tending to increase them.8 Other renewable support schemes
might impact retail prices if these are recovered within the electricity market, but not necessarily if these are
funded with revenue from other taxes, e.g., through federally-funded programs.

2.2

Retail tariff design and Ramsey pricing

How are the costs of environmental policies recovered in the long-run? What are the implications from
an efficiency and distributional point of view? Studies have often considered the impact from wholesale
policies in a stylized fashion, assuming consumers face the wholesale market price (Fell and Linn, 2013;
Wibulpolprasert, 2014). However, wholesale prices are seldom the prices that final consumers face. For
example, most customers do not directly face real-time wholesale prices. Therefore, even when carbon
taxes signal the environmental externality to investors in real-time, it is less clear that such externality signal
is transferred to end consumers, specially at a high frequency.
Furthermore, it has also been quite common that depressed electricity prices at the wholesale level due
to increased renewable presence go hands-in-hands with retail price increases at the residential level, to
fund the corresponding renewable charges (quite explicitly, in the case of renewable portfolio standards, but
even so in the case of direct subsidies).9 Alternatively, these increased costs might be funded through tax
increases elsewhere in the economy, e.g., with revenues from income taxes.10
I focus on renewable policies that recoup investment costs within the electricity market, either by hav6

Allowing for complementary ITC policies is important to rationalize the presence of solar investment in the data. Therefore,
I include such incentives as a complement to all policy scenarios. PTCs are not strictly part of the simulations, but they can be
considered as part of the equilibrium RPS price, as they are also proportional to output. To make the comparison more stark, I
abstract away from PTCs when considering a carbon tax policy.
7
Note that wholesale prices also tend to decrease in the presence of RPS policies, as the burden of RPS obligations is typically
imposed to the retailers, not the generators.
8
Note that RPS does not necessarily increase retail prices, as discussed in Fischer (2010).
9
For example, Spain has a very aggressive subsidy and feed-in tariff program for both wind and solar. In spite of substantial
drops in wholesale prices, renewable charges to end consumers have put substantial upward pressure on final prices at the retail
level. Germany has had similar experiences with substantial increases in renewable charges. See Frondel et al. (2015) for an
examination of the distributional impacts in Germany.
10
General equilibrium effects from funding these policies are an important issue, but not the focus of this paper.

Renewable sources see their effective opportunity cost reduced by the RPS price,

are charged.

Notes: This table summarizes the main features of alternative large-scale renewable policies. The key differences are
on whether incidence is at the wholesale or retail level, whether the signal is marginal with regards to the market price
(carbon tax, RPS and subsidy), and whether the signal is marginal with regards to the externality (carbon tax). As
stated in the table, retail impacts are very dependent on how renewable costs are passed-through to consumers.

ing direct impacts on wholesale market prices, or by funding additional payments through retail tariffs. I
consider four different ways in which renewable costs are recouped through retail tariffs:
(a) Flat tariffs with lump-sum fees (baseline). Environmental policies do not affect retail prices at the
margin other than through its effects on wholesale prices, unless explicit to the policy design.
(b) Flat tariffs with marginal renewable fees. Prices are constant and sufficiently high to recover both
production and environmental costs, independently of whether environmental costs are reflected in
wholesale prices.
(c) Real-time prices with marginal renewable fees. Additional marginal fees (e.g., marginal renewable
charges) are added to wholesale prices, increasing effective retail prices.
(d) Ramsey retail tariffs. Prices are constant and also sufficiently high to recover both production and
environmental costs, but can differ across customer classes.
As it is well known, Ramsey prices will tend to recommend higher prices to the least elastic consumer
types. In the simplest setting in which the environmental policy is taken as given (e.g., the level of the
feed-in-tariff), traditional Ramsey prices recommend,
ps − c
λ 1
=
,
ps
1 + λ s
where s indexes a given sector and s represents its elasticity of demand. Typically, Ramsey prices are not
explicitly derived in practice, but many of the arguments justifying lower prices to the industrial sector are
related to the potential relocation of industrial production (i.e., higher elasticity).
In the model and quantitative exercise, I examine whether such prescriptive result can rationalize charging the residential sector more heavily, and whether it is still valid in the presence of environmental goals.
Indeed, in many markets renewable subsidies are utilized without accounting for environmental externalities (or pricing them below the SCC). Therefore, Ramsey prices as typically prescribed might not correlate
one-to-one with the environmental goals. If prices do not reflect the externality, then optimal Ramsey prices
become:

ps − c
λ 1
1 es × SCC
=

ps
1 + λ s 1 + λ
ps

where es is the marginal emissions rate from consumption by sector s.11 In the presence of both a revenue
raising component and an environmental externality, the additional externality term brings prices closer
together in relative terms as long as es is the same for all sectors.12 Intuitively, if there is no revenue raising
motive (λ = 0), then the price equals marginal cost plus the environmental externality. Note that, if one still
enforces the zero profit condition typical in a Ramsey setting, it can even be that the zero-profit constraints
binds from below (λ < 0). This could happen if the renewable target is not in line with the social cost of
11

This can be derived in a traditional Ramsey framework by modifying the objective function to include the externality from
emissions times the social cost of carbon.

In the presence of industrial leakage, the marginal emissions rate from reducing consumption is not necessarily equal across
sector, in which case optimal Ramsey prices may not become more similar.

carbon, and a carbon tax raises revenue above and beyond the costs of the renewable policy. In such case,
the result reverts and more elastic consumers should be taxed more. I evaluate the distributional implications
of these Ramsey designs in Section 5.4.

2.3

Efficiency and distributional implications

When considering the efficiency and distributional implications of environmental policies, their designs are
seldom equivalent (even conditional on achieving a certain target). Furthermore, as explained above, such
environmental policies interact with retail design, which also impacts both the efficiency and distributional
implications of these policies. Before getting to the model and empirical implementation, I discuss the
potential impacts of these policies.
2.3.1

Impacts to producers

The benefits and costs across technologies from environmental policies depend quite heavily on their implementation. When it comes to existing generation sources, they will tend to suffer losses in the presence
of explicit large-scale renewable policies, as these policies encourage the entry of resources that are very
cheap at the margin. The costs will be particularly acute if renewable entry is large enough to substantially
affect the distribution of wholesale prices in those hours of highest demand, which tend to provide a large
share of revenues to incumbents. Carbon taxes, on the contrary, are not necessarily detrimental to incumbent
producers. Due to the impact of carbon taxes on wholesale prices, incumbent producers will tend to benefit
if they are relatively clean. For example, hydro and nuclear power plants will benefit favorably from such
policies.
When it comes to renewable technologies, as highlighted by other studies (Joskow, 2011; Borenstein,
2012a; Callaway et al., 2015), renewable resources have distinct benefits at the margin, which can depend on
the correlation of generation with demand or the existing generation mix in a given area. Several studies have
examined the contributions of renewable sources in reducing emissions and also in displacing generation
costs from traditional power producers (e.g., see Cullen (2013); Novan (2015); Callaway et al. (2015)).
These are often called the environmental and market value of renewable generation, referring to avoided
emissions and saved fuel costs, respectively. Depending on the choice of renewable policy, such costs and
benefits might be signaled more effectively (Fell and Linn, 2013).
Importantly, alternative renewable policies differentially affect investment across renewable technologies. For example, policies focused on the environmental value of renewables (e.g., a flat feed-in tariff
rewarding cleaner technologies) will tend to favor technologies whose investment costs relative to production are most favorable, independently on when production occurs. A subsidy or RPS mechanism that
complements the wholesale price, on the other hand, will tend to favor resources whose output is more
correlated with electricity demand.

9

2.3.2

Impacts to customer classes

Consumers will tend to see price reductions in the presence of renewable subsidies or feed-in tariffs that
are not recovered through the electricity market, and cost price increases in the presence of RPS policies
or carbon taxes. If environmental costs are recovered in the electricity market with environmental charges,
electricity prices will tend to increase. In such case, consumers will tend to face larger electricity bills than
in the absence of renewable policies, although this is not necessarily true generically. For example, Liski
and Vehviläinen (2016) show that, in the Nordic market, consumers have likely benefited from lower prices
due to subsidies to renewables, even after taking into account renewable charges, at least in the short run.
From a practical perspective, there are also important differences in how different customer classes are
charged for renewable services, which has been controversial. For example, Germany has been a leader in
renewable investment policies with very ambitious targets. These high targets in both wind and solar have
increased the total costs of electricity production. Yet, most retail price increases appear to have fallen on
smaller residential and commercial consumers, which has generated an intense policy debate both from an
equity point of view and from an industrial policy point of view.13 In the United States, the costs of RPS are
also not necessarily equally passed-through to final consumers. Greenstone and McDowell (2015) estimate
the pass-through of RPS policies to retail tariffs and find that renewable portfolio standards have affected
residential rates most significantly, followed by commercial rates and industrial rates.
Ultimately, the sectoral efficiency and distributional impacts will depend on several margins. They will
depend on the elasticity of each consumer class, their consumption profiles, and whether these differences
are accounted for when designing tariffs and allocating the costs of renewables. In particular, differences
in how environmental costs are passed-through at the retail level will be particularly important from an
efficiency point of view for those sectors that are most elastic. From a distributional point of view, how the
cost recovery is implemented will also affect which sectors benefit the most. Furthermore, with real time
pricing, hourly consumption profiles and how they correlate with renewable resources will also affect the
costs and benefits to different kinds of consumers.
2.3.3

Impacts between regulated and unregulated regions

Finally, the efficiency and distributional implications of these policies can depend on how emissions from
other regions are treated. For example, in the presence of RPS policies with differential targets across regions, the optimality of investments will depend crucially on whether trade across regions is allowed. The
effects of carbon taxes can also be substantially different depending on whether imports are appropriately
taxed for their carbon content. More generally, the impacts of these policies depend substantially on whether
imports are subject to such regulations, which determines whether the marginal cost of compliance is efficiently equalized at the margin.
In the absence of regulation of imports, leakage of emissions to unregulated regions will tend to occur
whenever wholesale prices increase, as importers become relatively more competitive at the margin (Fowlie,
13
Other members of the European Union argued that such uneven pass-through to different sectors could be considered an industrial subsidy, which was carefully examined by the comission, e.g., see http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_
IP-16-3525_en.htm.

10

2009). Therefore, imports will tend to increase in the presence of a carbon tax. Such emissions leakage
dilutes reductions in environmental damages and also distorts the efficient production of imports vs. instate production. For the purposes of the counterfactual analysis, I consider both cases in which imports
are included in the environmental policy, as well as situations in which importers can circumvent such
regulations and leakage occurs, e.g. due to contract reshuffling (Bushnell et al., 2014).
Leakage can also become an important concern in the industrial sector.14 If electricity consumption
at the industrial level is reduced, it can come from two sources: (a) true reductions in industrial output or
improvements in industrial processes, and (b) relocation of production to other regions. The potential for
leakage thus interacts with the optimal retail design, and may justify reducing the incidence of environmental
costs to the industrial sector even further, aggravating the redistributional impacts across classes.

3

Model

To analyze the interaction between renewable policies and tariff design in an empirical fashion, I construct
a partial-equilibrium model with three demand sectors (residential, commercial and industrial), different
generation technologies, and imports. Some of the modeling choices are motivated by features from the
California market, which is used later to calibrate the model. Other than that, the model is a relatively
standard investment model for electricity, with the added feature that environmental policies and retail tariffs
co-exist.
In this section, I lay out the main ingredients, and also explain how environmental policies and retail
tariffs are implemented in the model. I discuss the calibration of the model in the next section.

3.1

Demand

I specify an hourly demand curve for three different sectors: residential, commercial and industrial.
qsth = αsth − γsth psth ,

∀ s, t, h,

(1)

where s indexes the sector, t indexes the day, and h the hour of the day. Demand levels might change over
time (e.g., as a function of weather, day of the week, etc.), which is captured by the intercept αsth . Note that
retail electricity prices psth , and the responsiveness to prices γsth , can be sector-specific.

3.2

Imports

Imports from other regions are represented by an import supply curve. Given that California is practically
always a net importer, I focus on the net import supply curve:
m
mth = αth
+ ρth pw
th ,
14

∀ t, h.

See Fowlie et al. (2016) for a discussion of industrial leakage in the context of California.

11

(2)

The parameter ρth captures the responsiveness of imports to wholesale prices pw
th at a given day and hour.
As in the demand model, the import supply intercept might fluctuate over time, as captured by the intercept
m.
αth

To allow for the potential of leakage or contract reshuffling, I consider two extreme cases. One in which
imports face carbon taxes, and one in which they do not. When firms face carbon costs, their supply curve
shifts, which can be captured as,
m
m
mth = αth
+ ρth (pw
th − e τ ) ,

∀ t, h,

(3)

where τ represents the carbon tax and em the marginal emissions rate of imports.

3.3

Generation

Generation is assumed to be competitive. Firms produce as long as the marginal price of energy is above
their marginal cost:

gith


if pw

th < mci (gith ),
 0,
=
[0, Ki ], if pw
th = mci (gith ),


Ki ,
else,

∀ i, t, h,

(4)

where i indexes a given technology. Note that the price that power plants receive is the wholesale electricity
price pw
th , which is different from the retail electricity prices faced by consumers. Marginal costs are assumed
to be potentially increasing in the amount of generation. Because the model is aggregated by technology,
this increase in marginal cost should be interpreted as heterogeneity in marginal costs within a certain class
of generators, not necessarily within a plant.
Renewable production is very different in nature to thermal production. To first order, wind and solar
power is used as long as it is available, subject to potential curtailment needs. Therefore, I assume its
production is exogenously given by weather conditions, which determine availability factors and limit total

rjth ≤ λjth Kj ,

∀ j, t, h,

(5)

where j represents a particular renewable resource (e.g., wind or solar), λjth is an exogenously given capacity factor for a given day and time, and Kj is the installed capacity of a given resource.15
Hydro production decisions are also very different than those of thermal generators, as they are subject
to availability constraints which create dynamic links. In this paper, I simplify the hydro decision problem
15

Note that capacity could potentially change over time, e.g., as more investment in renewables occurs. I consider a long-run
investment model where capacity is constant.

∀ t, h.

hth = hth ,

I treat nuclear power, nth , in the same fashion as a “must-run”, assuming that generation would have been
the same as observed in the data.

3.4

Environmental Policies

I consider the implementation of large-scale renewable policies, which incentivize investment in renewable
technologies. In the model, these policies are reflected as follows:
1. Carbon tax. The marginal cost for a given generation goes up by τ ei , where τ is the carbon tax and
ei the emissions rate of generation technology i.
2. Feed-in tariff. Renewable technologies do not receive payments from the wholesale electricity market
and receive a flat tariff instead, pf it .
3. Renewable portfolio standard (RPS). A certain share of electricity production needs to be purchased
from renewable sources, RP S. I calculate the equilibrium RPS price that ensures a certain percent of
renewable production, prps , i.e.,
P

= RP S.

Under RPS, renewable technologies receive the RPS supplement prps , in addition to the wholesale market
price. I assume the burden of satisfying RPS falls into the retailers side. Retailers need to pay their share of
RPS obligations at the margin, i.e., the marginal cost of serving demand increases by RP S × prps .17

3.5

Equilibrium

Several variables are defined implicitly as functions of equilibrium prices (e.g., demand, generation, imports). To close the model, I add the following additional constraints.
16
Hydro power represents a relatively small fraction of in-state production in California, specially in recent years, although
this assumption clearly abstracts away from peak-shaving behavior, i.e., selling at the hours with highest prices, which might
endogenously change in the counterfactual scenarios considered.
17
Other papers have considered the case in which integrated utilities take into account the effect of their own production on their
RPS obligations, and therefore incorporate the RPS price at the generation level (Fischer and Newell, 2008; Fell and Linn, 2013).
I assume retailers are the ones charging renewable energy credit (REC) prices at the margin, as this is how it is implemented in
practice. The key difference is whether the incidence of the RPS price falls onto wholesale prices or retail prices. This is analogous
if retail prices are assumed to be equal to the wholesale price.

The wholesale price is determined by the marginal cost of the most expensive unit being used (the
marginal unit). The solution can be expressed as a system of first order conditions with complementarities:
gith ≥ 0 ⊥ pw
th − mci (gith ) − ψith ≤ 0,

∀ i, t, h,

(8)

where ψith ≥ 0 represent the infra-marginal rents of a given unit that is producing a positive amount of
energy. Note that for wind and solar generators the condition is similar, although in such case the marginal
cost of production is close to zero. Environmental policy payments (or taxes) will also be different depending
on the technology, and affect the effective marginal cost.
Wholesale investment.

I allow for endogenous investment in the model, both of new gas power plants

and renewable generators (wind and solar).18 Because there are already several generators in place, I only
consider new investment at the margin. Following Bushnell (2010), generators of new technologies enter
the market until their zero profit condition is satisfied. For gas investment, this implies
Kinew ≥ 0 ⊥ Fi (Kinew ) −

X

ψith ≤ 0,

∀ i ∈ new.

where Fi is a function determining the fixed costs of installing new generators. For renewable plants, the
zero profit condition also includes any additional payment that comes from the renewable policies (e.g.,
feed-in tariff or subsidies), as well as potentially an investment tax credit (IT Cj ), which rewards renewable
investment proportionally to the capacity of the investment.
Kjnew ≥ 0 ⊥ Fi (Kjnew ) − IT Cj Kjnew −

ψjth − AddtionalP olicyP aymentsj ≤ 0,

where the additional policy payments come from rewards not explicitly priced in the electricity market (and
thus not reflected in ψjth ). In the case of the feed-in-tariff, renewables do not receive the market price, and
therefore all revenues come from these additional policy payments and ψjth = 0.
I allow fixed cost to depend on the level of investment, which introduces some convexity in the costs
of investment and can be considered a proxy for the fact that locations in which to place generators might
become more scarce as power plants are built. Construction costs for new power plants could also increase
as demand for raw materials increase. Similarly, suitable locations for renewable power might become more
scarce or less desirable from a reliability point of view, potentially decreasing the value of the investment.19
18

Note that I do not allow for new investment in hydro resources, nuclear and coal, given that these are unlikely to happen in the
California context. These technologies are also not playing a major role in many other mature electricity markets, due to their cost
uncertainty, lack of economic viability or the difficulties in placing new hydro projects.
19
In practice, the impact of reliability costs on the value of investment depends quite heavily on market design, but it is not

14

Retail prices Because the recovery of electricity expenses and its distributional implications is the main
focus of the paper, I consider a situation in which retail prices for electricity have to at least cover the total
payments to electricity producers, i.e.,
XXX
t

psth − pw

(11)

s

This expression implies that electricity-specific policies, even if not explicitly passed-through to wholesale prices, are ultimately charged to final consumers to recover the costs of renewables. The additional
policy payments are only relevant for those renewable policies that offer renewable payments outside of
the wholesale electricity market clearing, i.e., for the feed-in tariff. In the baseline case, additional policy
payments are not recovered within the electricity sector.20 The additional policy payments can also become
negative, in the case of the carbon tax, in the more unorthodox case in which carbon tax revenues are rebated
to electricity consumers at the margin.
Because there are many degrees of freedom to set up retail prices that ensure revenue sufficiency as
expressed in equation (11), I consider several stylized alternatives:
(a) Flat prices with lump-sum fees. This is the baseline scenario in which consumers face flat prices,
plus a fixed lump-sum fee Φ to ensure full recovery, which only has distributional implications. Therefore, psth = p̄w , where p̄w is the weighted average price in the wholesale market.
(b) Constant retail tariffs. I consider a case in which retail electricity prices are flat and exogenously set
at p. The revenue constraint is again sufficient to determine p.
(c) Real-time prices with marginal fee. I assume consumers pay the real-time price of electricity plus a
constant retail fee that ensures recovery of environmental charges, i.e., psth = pw
th + φ. The revenue
constraint is sufficient to determine φ. When combined with a carbon tax that equals the social cost
of carbon, it provides a first-best benchmark.
(d) Ramsey retail tariffs. I consider optimal Ramsey prices that maximize welfare, in which prices are
allowed to be different by sector (residential, commercial and industrial). To simplify the problem, I
impose that retail tariffs are constant at the sector level, and thus there are only three sectoral prices,
and solve,
p = arg max W (p) ≡ CS(p) + P S(p).
p

Note that the measure of welfare that I use to determine Ramsey prices does not include the emissions
externality, and therefore the Ramsey solution should be interpreted as the sectoral retail tariffs that maximize welfare in the electricity sector in a narrow sense. The reason to focus on this narrow definition of
welfare is that most large-scale renewable policies are set up to incentivize renewable technologies, but they
uncommon that wind and solar farms pay part of these additional costs, thus effectively reducing their investment value as renewable
penetration increases.
20
Given the partial equilibrium nature of the model, the impact of such policy payments outside of the electricity model are left
unspecified.

15

do not directly target emissions damages. The assumption is that retail tariffs cannot be justified based on
the externality unless it is being taxed explicitly, as in the case of a carbon tax. In section 5.4 I compare this
baseline to the case in which the objective function appropriately takes into account emissions damages.

3.6

Solving the model

To reduce the dimensionality of the data and make the computations more tractable, I use a k-means algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 100 representative hours, based on the full data from
2011-2014 with over 43,000 hours.21 The algorithm tries to find similar hours in terms of load, hydro and
nuclear production, imports, consumption by the residential, commercial and industrial sector, and capacity
factors of solar and wind. It then provides an average and weight for each of the representative hours to make
the reduced sample as accurate as possible. Figures A.1 and A.2 in the appendix show how the clustered
data successfully capture the main patterns in the data.
Using the clustered data, I solve the supply model as a mathematical complementarity problem for given
environmental policy parameters, in the spirit of Bushnell et al. (2008) and Bushnell (2010). The model is
iterated to find the equilibrium tax, feed-in-tariff and RPS price levels that ensure a certain level of emissions
reductions. Additionally, to compute the endogenous retail rates, I nest the complementarity problem into
one that solves for the revenue requirement constraint (in the case of fees) and the welfare maximizing price
mix (in the case of the Ramsey prices).22

4

Data

The goal of the exercise is to explore the trade-off between alternative combinations of large-scale renewable
policies and retail tariff designs. To calibrate the investment model and illustrate its implications, I use data
from the California electricity market (CAISO) during the years 2011 to 2015.23

4.1

Demand data

To obtain load profiles, CAISO reports hourly load data at the trading hub level for three different areas
(NP15, ZP26, SP15). These data are aggregated across all consumer types. Additionally, I collect data from
the three main utilities (PG&E, SCE, SDGE). In particular, I obtain dynamic load profiles by rate category
from each utility, which provide hourly consumption patterns for representative agents in mainly three categories (residential, commercial and industrial).24 Dynamic load profiles do not provide total consumption
by sector for all utilities. Instead, I use EIA Form-826 data, which provides total monthly demand and
21
I find that the results are very similar whether I take 100, 200 or 500 observation clusters, but the smaller number of clusters
allows me to consider a wider range of scenarios in a computationally faster way.
22
Because the revenue constraint is non-linear, I cannot solve for it in one step. Similarly, total welfare is a non-linear object that
I need to maximize, and therefore the full problem cannot be expressed as a one-step complementarity problem.
23
Some data spans longer time horizons, but some of the renewable data are limited to 2013 onwards. All data used is publicly
available, which can have some advantages, such as replication ability, but it also leads to some shortcomings.
24
Unfortunately, the dynamic load data only provides information for one representative consumer per customer class, which is
an important limitation. Depending on the utility, dynamic profiles can be further disaggregated into smaller consumer classes, as
a function of their rate. To homogenize across utilities, I only consider these three main categories.

number of customers by sector and utility, to scale up the hourly load profiles and obtain hourly aggregate
consumption by customer class and utility.
To highlight the heterogeneity across customer classes, Figure 1a shows average consumption by month
of the year, separated across customer classes, normalized so that they are comparable. As can be seen
in the data, residential consumption is much more seasonal than commercial and industrial consumption,
although in all cases consumption peaks during the summer, due to air conditioning. Figure 1b shows
heterogeneity in hourly consumption across sectors, also normalized. As one can see, residential consumers
exhibit substantially different patterns in their daily consumption, with consumption peaking later in the day.
The correlation of sectoral demand with electricity prices and renewable resources will affect the relative gains and losses of different customer classes. In the data, I find that residential demand is most
correlated with wholesale prices (44%), consistent with being a major driver of prices in the wholesale market, although commercial and industrial demand are also strongly correlated with prices (32% and 40%,
respectively). When looking at resource availability, I find commercial demand to be most correlated to
solar production, together with industrial demand (61% and 43%, respectively), whereas residential demand
is positively correlated with solar generation to a much lesser extent (7%). Finally, wind production is
positively correlated with demand across sectors, but less strongly than solar.
Elasticities To parameterize the demand functions in the model, one needs a measure of demand elasticity.
Unfortunately, the aggregate data used in this study is not well suited for estimating elasticities by customer
class.25 I perform sensitivity analysis for alternative elasticity values. The one maintained assumption across
simulations is that there is a sorting in the degree of elasticity across consumers, with the residential sector
being the least responsive. This is consistent with residential customers having less margins of adjustment—
as opposed to industrial customers, who have higher incentives to better optimize their processes or switch to
25

Even with more disaggregate data, estimation of elasticities for electricity demand can be challenging, due to limited variation
in retail tariffs.

self-generation, and also consistent with studies for other utilities such as natural gas (Davis and Muehlegger,
2010).
Table 2 summarizes the baseline elasticities assumed in the model, together with conditional average
shares by consumer class, to give a sense of which sectors represent the bulk of electricity demand.26 There
is a wide range of elasticity estimates in the literature. For residential households, I use a baseline elasticity
of -0.15, which is on the mid-lower end of current estimates.27 For commercial users, I use an elasticity of
-0.30, and for large industrial customers I use an elasticity of 0.50.28
With the observed prices and demand, together with the assumed elasticities, I construct the parameters
αsth and ρsth , as typically done in the literature (Bushnell et al., 2008). In particular, I compute,
ρsth = ηs

q̂sth
,
p̄w

∀s, t, h,

αsth = q̂sth + ρsth p̄w ,

∀s, t, h.

Note that I use wholesale prices to calibrate demand. I take this approach because retail tariffs include many
more services and charges that are beyond the scope of the model. Because consumers tend to be on flat
prices, and this is the baseline scenario considered, I use average prices instead of hourly real-time prices to
calibrate demand.

4.2

Price, production and imports data

I obtain hourly wholesale electricity prices and generation data from CAISO. Hourly data for production
and imports come from CAISO’s Daily Watch report. Production data are disaggregated across generation
types (nuclear, hydro, thermal, renewables and imports). Additionally, renewables are further disaggregated
into geothermal, biomass, biogas, small hydro, wind, photovoltaic solar, and thermal solar, also at the hourly
level.
Table 3 shows summary statistics for the main variables. One can see that wholesale electricity prices
26

Some sectors, such as the agricultural sector, are not captured by the model. Therefore, these are shares among these three
customer classes.
27
Ito (2014) finds an elasticity of -0.08 with respect to average electricity prices. Reiss and White (2005) find an elasticity -0.39,
with substantial heterogeneity depending on the presence of air conditioning and/or space heating. Fell et al. (2014) find much
larger estimates using CEX data, most of them between -0.75 and -1. Deryugina et al. (2017) find an elasticity between -0.16 and
-0.27 when looking at medium-run elasticities, and -0.30 to -0.35 in the long run.
28
There is limited evidence on the price response of commercial and industrial customers. Jessoe and Rapson (2015) find limited
response of small commercial and industrial users to time-of-use pricing, although such response might be rather focused on the
short-run. Similarly, Blonz (2016) reports elasticities between -0.08 and -0.22. I use larger elasticities to reflect the potentially
larger medium-run response by commercial and industrial users. Sensitivity to the assumed elasticities is presented in the appendix.

average around $35.50/MWh during this period. Nuclear is the most stable source of generation, with an
extremely compressed interquantile range. Hydro power is also a baseload source of power, although it
fluctuates much more seasonally and over the years. Thermal power, mainly natural gas, is the main source
of generation, and produces between 10 to 11 GWh per hour on average. Renewables produce an average
of 3.8 GWh, although they experience substantial fluctuations. Their production has also experienced important growth, with an average of 4.8 GWh of production in the last year of the sample. Finally, imports
represent about 25% of total generation in the California market.
Together with installed capacity data for each renewable resource, I construct capacity factors for wind
and solar resources, respectively. Figure 2 shows the capacity factors during the years 2013-2015. As
one can see, wind and solar technologies have substantially different patterns in their availability, with
solar being available mainly during sunlight hours. These capacity factors determine the attractiveness of
investment in the two renewable technologies represented in the model, wind and solar. As highlighted
by Fell and Linn (2013), heterogeneity in capacity factors can increase the differences between alternative
policy designs, depending on whether they emphasize market or environmental values. In the data, wind
capacity factors are negatively correlated with wholesale prices (-7%), whereas solar capacity factors are
associated positively with wholesale prices (32%). Production data are used to construct hydro production
in the model, hth , and to calibrate the capacity factors of renewable resources, λjth .
The import data are used to estimate imports into California as a function of prices. In line with Bushnell
et al. (2008), I estimate the following import supply curve:
m m
ln mth = η m ln pw
th + Xth β + δt + th ,

where the log of prices is instrumented with realized load, taken as exogenous to the importers. Alternative
controls are considered, such as weather and fixed effects. Table 4 reports the results from the regression.
As one can see, the results are very stable across specifications and suggest an average elasticity of imports
around 0.30. As in the demand model, I use observed imports and wholesale prices, together with the
m and ρm , following the same approach used for
assumed import elasticity, to back out the parameters αth

Cost data

Existing generators.

I obtain generator-level marginal cost data from the Emissions & Generation Re-

source Integrated Database (eGRID).29 These data are used to calibrate a stylized supply curve by type of
generation as well as their emissions rate. Because of the long-run aspect of the model, I only include
generators that were built before 2009, so that the model endogenously solves for investment in new gas
and renewable generation during this period. To make the simulation model more tractable, I consider a
supply curve with only three piece-wise linear segments, which are fit to capture the supply curve in the
California market. Despite being a seemingly crude approximation, one can see that it turns out to generate
a decent characterization of both marginal costs and emissions rates in this market. The data are also used
to calibrate carbon emissions rates of these generators, which also appear to be appropriately captured by a
simple piece-wise linear approximation.
New Investment. The model allows for new investment in both gas and renewable generation, for which I
need a measure of marginal and fixed costs. I use data from the EIA to inform these parameters (U.S. Energy
Information Administration, 2016). For marginal costs, I use a value of 6,600 Btu/kWh for the heat rate of
new gas generators.30 I consider a range of gas prices between $3 and $4/MMbtu, plus additional variable
O&M costs of $3.5/MWh (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016), which imply a marginal cost
for new gas generators ranging between $23 and $30/MWh.31 For fixed costs, I use values from the same
report, which sets $978/kW for natural gas generators, $1,877/kW for onshore wind, and $2,534/kW for PV
solar. I annualize such costs over a twenty year horizon with a 5% discount rate.
As explained in the model, a constant fixed cost per generator might not be realistic, as at some point
geographical limitations might make investments less attractive. Therefore, I introduce a convexity that
makes fixed costs per MW increasing as a function of total new investment.32 As robustness, and given that
the costs of renewables have changed dramatically over the last few years, I also consider investment costs
from the EIA report in 2013,, which imply a cost of $2,354/kW for wind and $4,120/kW for solar. As an
alternative source of cost estimates, the EIA-860 data for 2013 reports average realized construction costs
per kW of installed capacity by type of generation. These imply an average cost of $1,895/kW for onshore
wind, and $3,705/kW for PV solar, also consistent with the range of values considered.

4.4

Policy parameters

Emissions.

Emissions costs are evaluated at a $30 social cost of carbon (SCC). Emissions rates for existing

generators are based on the approximation presented in Figure 3b. Imports are assumed to have an emissions
rate of 0.428 tCO2 /MWh, which was set by Western Climate Initiative as a default emissions rate (Bushnell
29

https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid.
This heat rate is based on new investment ideal heat rates. The EIA reports weighted average heat rates for actual new gas
plants in 2015 and 2016 of 7,029 Btu/kWh.
31
Given current low gas prices, I consider $3/MMbtu in the baseline scenario.
32
In particular, fixed costs increase by 10% for each GW of new installed capacity. The model is also feasible without increasing
fixed costs, but it has a tendency of generating results that can be very dependent on the value of certain parameters such as the
marginal cost of new technologies or their fixed cost (e.g., the solution may experience “bang-bang” behavior for small changes in
such parameters).

Notes: This figure shows how the supply curve is approximated by three segments. One can see that both
marginal costs and emissions rates are represented quite accurately using a simple three piece-wise linear
approximation when power plants are sorted according to their heat rates. Importantly, the ordering of
emissions rates is very highly correlated with the ordering of heat rates, with the exception of a few small
power plants which appear to have emissions rates outside the usual range.

22

et al., 2014). This corresponds to assuming that marginal imports are from natural gas power plants. New
gas investment is assumed to have a cleaner state-of-the-art emissions rate of 0.35 tCO2 /MWh.
Carbon tax.

The carbon tax is endogenized to achieve a 10% reduction in emissions. In the baseline

scenario, this implies a carbon tax of around $23, not far from expected carbon prices.
Renewable targets.

The feed-in tariff and RPS policies are calibrated to generate the same 10% of carbon

emissions reductions in the baseline simulation. The RPS price is subsequently endogenized to hold the
percent of renewables fixed, whereas I maintain the subsidies fixed at their baseline levels for the feed-in
tariff. I also consider alternative targets to trace out the abatement cost curve.
Investment Tax Credit (ITC). I set the ITC to be 30% of annualized fixed costs for solar installations,
which in the baseline case amounts to $60/kW-yr.

4.5

Limitations and caveats

The model and its calibration are stylized, and suffer from several simplifications and limitations. Therefore,
the exercise should be seen as a stylized representation of the California electricity market, used to highlight
the differences between combinations of environmental policies and retail designs in a broader context.
One limitation of the model is the reduced form representation of the import supply curve. This has two
main caveats. First, it does not capture potential heterogeneity in behavior by renewable and non-renewable
resources in the unregulated regions that could affect the import supply curve of traditional generators.
Second, the elasticity used in the framework might not be reflective of long-run behavior by importers. I
consider sensitivity analysis with respect to this parameter by considering a more elastic import curve that
responds more aggressively to changes in California prices, and find similar results.
Another important limitation is the absence of distributed generation, which is of great importance in
the California market. Whereas the focus of this paper is on large-scale renewable policies, distributed generation policies can interact substantially with the wholesale equilibrium outcome, due to their impacts on
demand profiles. Distributed-generation policies also have important distributional implications at the residential level, e.g., as studied in Borenstein (2015).33 Studying the redistributional impacts of such policies
in counterfactual simulations would require a much more detailed representation of household heterogeneity
and billing structure, which is beyond the scope of the investment model presented here.

Results

I present simulations for three different policy designs (carbon tax, feed-in tariff, and renewable portfolio
standard). First, I consider the case in which payments related to the environmental policy are not directly

by the tariff design, and compare the efficiency and distributional impacts between these two scenarios.

5.1

Baseline results

Table 5 presents summary statistics for basic market outcomes for the four alternative policies, together with
a no-policy case.
Prices and Demand.

Table 5 shows significant differences in wholesale and retail prices across different

policy scenarios. The carbon tax increases wholesale prices significantly, reflecting a marginal impact of
carbon taxes of approximately $10 on average. The other policies tend to depress wholesale prices due
to the entry of marginally cheaper sources of production, such as wind and solar. Final consumers only
face price increases under two scenarios, the carbon tax and RPS, where utilities are assumed to charge an
additional constant marginal fee to consumers that ensures cost recovery. On the contrary, retail prices are
reduced under the feed-in-tariff, as the assumption is that such incentives are not paid for consumers in the
electricity market.
There are also substantial demand differences under these alternative policies. Under the carbon tax
and RPS regimes, consumer demand is lower than in the baseline simulation, due to increased retail prices,
while it is higher under the feed-in-tariff. This is the demand effect of alternative designs, which has been
highlighted in the literature (Fell and Linn, 2013). Mechanisms that pass-through the costs to consumers
at the margin tend to be preferred from a welfare standpoint, as they provide an additional incentive to
reduce emissions by reducing electricity demand. Demand reductions are indeed largest under the carbon
tax scenario.
Production and Investment.

Production is also affected by the different policies. Table 5 reports the

equilibrium level of production under the different policy scenarios, as well as out-of-state imports. Given
24

the assumed costs of investment by new technologies, the carbon tax incentivizes entry by new natural gas
plants only.34 Imports are reduced across scenarios, due to the higher emissions rate of imports.35
Renewable policies are designed to encourage investment in renewables more explicitly. Therefore,
investment looks quite different in the renewable policy scenarios. Given the relative capital costs of new
technologies, most of the investment occurs in wind and solar. The RPS policy, which leads to overall lower
investments, only sees entry by wind farms. In contrast, the feed-in-tariff treats leads to investments in both
wind and solar. Interestingly, investment in new natural gas is almost completely crowded out by renewable
entry, which has spurred a distributional tension between traditional generators and renewable entry.36
Sources of abatement.

The abatement channels across policies are distinct across the three designs. Fig-

ure 4a decomposes the sources of abatement for each of the policies considered. The first bar displays the
overall reduction in emissions, which by construction is the same in all scenarios. The next four bars in the
graph decompose the changes in emissions across channels. The second, third and fourth bars show emissions changes from demand, domestic production and imports assuming that the emissions rate is fixed at its
baseline level. The last bar shows the amount of emissions reductions that can be attributed to improvements
in emissions rates, holding demand at the baseline level.
For the case of a carbon tax, abatement comes from both reductions in consumption and reductions in
the average emissions rate. However, for the case of the feed-in-tariff, demand (and thus production) is
actually increasing. Thus, the only source of abatement is the transition to cleaner technologies. This is
why renewable investment needs to be much larger in the case of a feed-in-tariff. For the case of RPS, both
demand reductions and improvements in the average emissions rate contribute to reductions in emissions.
Compared to a carbon tax, the RPS over-incentivizes the entry of renewables, decreasing the wholesale
market price but increasing final prices to consumers. For that reason, demand reductions end up being
largest under the RPS scenario.
Figure 4b shows the average abatement cost across a range of emissions reductions between 5% to
20%. One confirms that the carbon tax is the most efficient policy, followed by the RPS policy, which also
increases prices to final consumers. When translated into average costs per CO2 reductions, the feed-intariff is most expensive, given that it does not reduce demand. These abatement cost curves can also be
useful to examine the robustness of the results to additional environmental considerations. Given that both
the RPS policies and feed-in-tariffs reduce emissions rates more dramatically, there is a question of whether
such policies could be justified on the basis of achieving reduction of other co-pollutants, such as particulate
matter or NOx (e.g., see Muller and Mendelsohn (2009)). One can see that the gap between the carbon tax
and the RPS policy is substantial, and unlikely to be justified only on the basis of co-pollutant emissions
reductions.37
34

This finding is robust to using cost assumptions with substantially higher natural gas prices, as seen in Appendix Table 8.
The reductions in imports are more pronounced if imports are more elastic, as shown in Appendix Table 9. The effects are
even more excacerbated if the emissions rate of imports is higher, leading to more investment in renewables, as shown in Appendix
Table 10.
36
The relative investments in wind and solar and dependent on the cost assumptions. In the appendix I include a robustness check
with more expensive renewables. Table 11 shows that investment in natural gas is still crowded out by wind investment. Renewable
policies become naturally more expensive.

Incidence and Welfare The differences in the sources of abatement are closely related to the winners
and losers of these policies. Table 6 summarizes welfare impacts across different agents participating in the
market. A common result in carbon regulation is that producers can benefit on average from environmental
policies that price carbon. This is clear from the producer surplus (reported in the first row), which increases
relative to the baseline in all alternative policy scenarios. However, these increased profits are not necessarily
equal across technologies. Hydro and nuclear benefit particularly with wholesale price increases due to a
carbon tax, and renewables are the major beneficiaries when explicit renewable policies are implemented
instead, with all other technologies loosing out.38
Absent any environmental considerations, consumers are on average worse off with a carbon tax and
an RPS policy, as retail prices increase significantly. Notable, the impacts to consumers at the margin are
specially large under the carbon tax, as prices increase the most in such scenario. On the contrary, consumers
benefit at the margin from policies that subsidize renewable entry. When looking at consumer impacts across
sectors, industrial customers are the ones benefiting the most from the feed-in tariff policy (in relative terms).
This is mainly due to the fact that they have the most elastic demand, and thus respond much more to price
reductions. This also makes them most sensitive to carbon taxes, with the highest reductions in surplus.
Figure 5a also shows that importers tend to suffer from these policies. If imports are charged for their
emissions, as assumed in the model, they tend to reduce importers rents. If instead importers can avoid cartricity generation in the Western Interconnection has relatively low marginal damages of at most $4.1/MWh, based on a conversion
of 300 Wh/mile. Other markets could have substantially higher benefits from expanding renewable generation, specially those in
the Midwest.
38
Note that these renewable producers could be either in- or out-of-state. My California-only model is too stylized to take a stand
on where such investments would occur.

27

bon taxes, they benefit particularly from the regulation. Thus, this result is very dependent on the assumption
that importers cannot circumvent carbon taxes, e.g., with contract reshuffling. Figure A.3 in the Appendix
shows the case in which there is reshuffling for the carbon tax. In the presence of reshuffling, importers
are net winners. Holding the carbon tax fixed, consumers are better off in the presence of reshuffling, as it
attenuates the increase in electricity prices, at least in a partial equilibrium sense. From an overall welfare
point of view, however, the case with reshuffling is naturally more inefficient, as it fails to equate marginal
abatement costs across in-state producers and imports.
Finally, in terms of overall welfare, the carbon tax performs better than the no-policy case, as expected.
However, the other renewable policies reduce welfare in this baseline. This is due to the relatively large
costs of installed renewable capacity, which make the average cost per ton abated exceed its benefits.39 This
should be already clear from Figure 4b, as the average abatement cost curves are substantially above the
assumed social cost of carbon of $30/ton of CO2 .

5.2

The role of cost recovery

The previous simulations assume that additional revenues and costs from environmental policies are not
passed-through to consumers at the margin, unless explicit to the policy design (e.g., for the carbon tax
or the RPS policy). However, this is not necessarily true in applied settings. Choices in how retail tariffs
are designed can substantially affect the discussion of the distributional (and efficiency) implications of
alternative designs.
Figure 5b shows the incidence impacts when retail tariffs are designed to recover or rebate environmental
costst through marginal charges. Renewable charges (or marginal carbon tax rebates) attenuate some of the
price differences that we observe at the wholesale level, and thus make policies more similar. In the presence
of marginal fees, retail prices decouple from wholesale prices and increase when compared to the baseline.
For this reason, all schemes reduce overall demand of electricity, and imply a reduction in consumer surplus.
All schemes imply a transfer of surplus from consumers to producers.
The results look particularly different for the case of the feed-in-tariff, when compared to Figure 5a.
The policies no longer generate surplus increases across producers and consumers. If retail prices reflect
the cost of renewable subsidies, consumers experience substantial losses. This is because the cost of renewables exceeds the reductions in wholesale prices. The implied feed-in-tariff to achieve a 10% reduction in
emissions is also reduced to $87 (from $107), as now the demand reduction role plays a substantial role.
One can see that the RPS and feed-in-tariff regime look much more similar, with the RPS policy slightly
out-performing the feed-in-tariff due to its signaling at the margin. If instead feed-in-tariff prices are held at
$107, but final consumers are charged for it, welfare is improved compared without renewable charges, but
it is substantially inefficient as the feed-in-tariff is too large.
When comparing welfare outcomes, the carbon tax is still the most effective option, in spite of the
detrimental effects of rebating carbon taxes at the margin. Indeed, because the emissions reductions are held
fix at 10%, the implied solution raises prices to $43, instead of $25, and therefore the externality signal is
39

One would need additional channels to justify such investments, such as learning-by-doing spillovers, job creation, etc.

still present. If instead one keeps the carbon tax at $23, but introduces marginal rebating, then the overall
welfare improvement is reduced by 20% as emissions reductions are lowered.

5.3

Efficiency implications of alternative retail tariffs

How do these alternative retail tariff designs compare from an efficiency point of view? To perform such
comparison, I focus on total welfare, which includes the benefits from emissions reductions. For ease of
comparison, Figure 6 compares each retail tariff design to the baseline case with no environmental policy.
For the case of a carbon tax, it is inefficient to rebate carbon at the margin. Therefore, the baseline policy
performs best, followed by marginal pricing, which performs similarly to flat prices in spite of introducing
rebating, highlighting the value of moving towards real-time prices in the presence of a carbon tax.40 For the
RPS case on the right, the most efficient pricing scheme is also the one with real-time prices and a marginal
fee, as one would expect. Importantly, Ramsey prices appear to reduce net welfare, even when compared
to flat prices. While Ramsey prices can be justified as a way to improve welfare in the electricity market
alone, they do not take into account the emissions externality. By subsidizing industrial and commercial
consumers, which are more price sensitive, the emissions reductions coming from demand response are
hampered.
With the feed-in-tariff, Ramsey prices also perform worst than the other policies that include renewable
40

The benefits could be even larger if consumers on real-time prices became more responsive, as found in Allcott (2011).

30

charges, but certainly better than not including any renewable charges at all (baseline). This is due to the
fact that prices are distorted in the baseline case: they do not reflect the externality, and wholesale prices are
potentially artificially depressed when renewables are at the margin. Thus, even though the flat tariffs and
Ramsey prices have limitations due to their coarseness and second-best nature, their impact on increased
retail prices has positive implications for the overall welfare.
The previous results highlight an inherent inefficiency in explicit renewable policies without final consumer charges: they do not reflect the cost of the externality in the wholesale price, and they potentially distort the wholesale price further by depressing prices in hours in which renewables are marginal. The carbon
tax explicitly prices the pollution externality, but does not necessarily incentivize investment in renewables,
if that is an explicit goal. The RPS policy, or an explicit renewable policy that ensures cost recovery through
the market, falls in between. It increases prices at the margin due to the renewable requirements and it explicitly incentivizes renewables. While the price signal from the renewable target does not correspond to the
optimal Pigouvian tax, it helps ameliorate some of the limitations present in the feed-in-tariff mechanism.
For this reason, in the feed-in-tariff all mechanisms, including Ramsey pricing, perform better than the case
of lump-sum transfers.41
Importantly, the results in Figure 6 assume that lump-sum transfers in the baseline are costless. However,
one could consider that raising taxes to pay for renewables outside of the electricity market has distortionary
effects in other sectors of the economy (Goulder, 1995; Goulder et al., 1999). In such case, passing through
the cost of renewables at the margin has two positive effects: it contributes to signaling the environmental
costs of electricity consumption, and at the same time it allows to raise the revenue necessary to pay for the
subsidies, avoiding other distortionary taxes.

5.4

Distributional implications of alternative retail designs

The designs summarized in Figure 6 hide important transfers between consumers of different sectors, even
more for the case of Ramsey prices, in which residential consumers end up paying a larger share of renewable
costs at the margin. Indeed, Figure 7 shows the changes in consumer surplus for the feed-in-tariff case when
Ramsey prices are considered.42 One can see that the marginal fee and flat pricing regimes have similar
implications from a distributional point of view, with the industrial sector suffering the most in relative terms.
Ramsey prices, on the contrary, have substantial impact on the redistribution of surplus across sectors, as they
predict substantially lower prices for the more elastic industrial and commercial consumers.43 Consumers
experiment the largest losses under such scenario.
It is hard to justify the distirbutional rent transfers experimented under Ramsey pricing from a welfare
point of view, given that, as shown in Figure 6, welfare is not necessarily better than using simple flat tariffs.
What explains such counterintuitive outcome? How would alternative welfare objectives affect Ramsey
41
If wholesale prices are instead too high due to other reasons, e.g., market power, or retail tariffs are inflated due to other charges,
increasing retail prices due to renewable charges might not move the price signal in the right direction.
42
Results are qualitatively similar for the RPS case.
43
Figure A.4 in the Appendix shows similar qualitative results for the case in which the elasticities of residential, commercial
and industrial customers are 0.15, 0.20 and 0.30, respectively. Due to the smaller differences in elasticity, the percent changes in
consumer surplues are smaller.

prices and thus its distibutional implications? Table 7 shows a quantification of optimal Ramsey prices
under alternative assumptions, and compares them to flat prices. One can see that residential consumers
are generally worse off under traditional Ramsey prices. A big driver of this result is the assumption of no
environmental considerations in the welfare objective and no leakage in the industrial sector. Under modest
feed-in-tariffs (Panel A), prices are still too low compared to the first-best, and therefore accounting for
externalities reverts the results: Ramsey prices should be largest for the most elastic sectors, as these are the
ones contribuiting the most to abatement through demand reductions. In the presence of industrial leakage,
then environmental Ramsey prices become largest for the commercial sector, as it is the one with no leakage
but still a more elastic demand.
If instead, one assumes that the feed-in-tariff is more aggressive (Panel B), leading to prices closer
to first-best, Ramsey prices perform better than flat tariffs, as flat prices introduce substantial distortions
at the margin. One can see that flat prices do indeed lead to large reductions in surplus for the industrial
sector, which is inefficient, which is substantially attenuated once Ramsey prices are introduced. Taking into
account the externality in this case does not change the main ranking of Ramsey prices, although it brings
them closer together. Introducing industrial leakage in this context leads again to a reduction in the optimal
price for the industrial sector, and therefore larger differences in welfare impacts between the residential and
the industrial sector.
Overall, these results highlight that the existing tension with respect to charging renewable charges to
the residential sector is nuanced, and the appropriateness of such scheme will depend on the underlying
fundamental assumptions about the optimal first-best environmental goal and the presence of industrial
leakage.

Conclusions

In this paper, I study the efficiency and distributional impacts of large-scale renewable policies, with special
emphasis on how the costs of such policies are passed-through to final consumers. To do so, I build an
electricity market model with endogenous investment by natural gas, wind and solar, which is calibrated
using data from the California electricity market. I then consider the interaction between four different
environmental policies (feed-in-tariff, renewable subsidies, renewable portfolio standards and carbon taxes)
with alternative retail tariff designs (no pass-through, marginal renewable charges, flat tariffs and Ramsey
pricing).
I find that large-scale renewable policies are most effective if the costs of the renewable subsidies are
passed-through to consumers directly in the electricity market, instead of being raised elsewhere in the
economy. The rationale for this result is that, in the presence of renewable subsidies, wholesale prices are
artificially low and do not reflect the pollution externality. For this same reason, I also find that the Ramsey
formula, which is meant to maximize welfare in the electricity market, fails to maximize welfare from a
broader environmental point of view, due to the misalignment of price signals and social costs. Therefore,
disproportionately imposing renewable charges to residential consumers is not necessarily justified from an
optimal taxation perspective in this second-best environment.
While retail tariffs can partially mitigate some of the inefficiencies from renewable subsidies, they are
still inferior to a carbon tax. In particular, while renewable charges help signal the higher cost of electricity
to final consumers, they do not provide the correct signals to producers. Therefore, the abatement channels
under carbon taxes (mainly, new investment in cleaner gas) still remain significantly cheaper than under
renewable subsidies (mainly, new investment in wind and solar), absent any other justifications to subsidize
renewables.
The model in the paper considers a stylized setting in which the only distortion is the absence of Pigouvian taxes that reflect the social cost of carbon. An interesting avenue for future work would be to consider

33

how the findings of this paper might change in the presence of other distortions, such as market power or
the presence of distortionary charges that affect the optimality of retail electricity prices.

Notes: This figure shows the changes in consumer surplus (CS), producer surplus (PS), import surplus
(IS) and their sum (Overall Change) with the introduction of a $15 carbon tax. It also reports overall welfare changes when accounting for the environmental benefits (Including Externality). The no reshuffling
case assumes imports are taxed, whereas in the reshuffling case importers can evade the tax.
