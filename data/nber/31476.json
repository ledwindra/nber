    "abstract": "\n\nWritten on the 50th anniversary of floating exchange rates, this paper deals with possible alternatives to a unipolar dollar-based system.  It considers (1) measures of international currency use; (2) potential challengers to the dollar; (3) network externalities; and (4) the plausibility of gold and digital currencies, as alternatives to regular currencies.  On the one hand, network externalities operate in favor of the status quo: the dollar as the single leading international currency.  On the other hand, the danger of abuse of exorbitant privilege \u2013 for example, by  debasing the currency or repeated use of sanctions \u2013 operates in favor of challengers.  A good guess is that the dollar will continue to lose market share slowly to others, but will remain in the lead.\n\n",
