    "abstract": "\n\nWhen the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases new numbers, in theory it should make no difference whether the press release emphasizes the most recent 1-month number, which is what it always does, or the 12-month number, as many other countries\u2019 statistical agencies do.  This paper offers the hypothesis that it does matter: Markets react to CPI inflation news via whichever framing the agency has adopted.\n\n",
