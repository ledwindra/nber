                      THE WELFARE ECONOMICS OF DEBT SERVICE


                                     ABSTRACT


     This paper analyzes some of the implications of the dual transfer a

debtor nation must undertake    to service foreign debt:     (a)   an internal transfer

from the private sector to the public sector; and (b) an external transfer

from the domestic economy to foreign creditors.       It shows that, under likely

circumstances,   a real depreciation of the home currency may complicate        the

internal transfer.    As long as non-traded goods are a net source of revenue

for the government,   the depreciation called for by debt service deteriorates

the public sector's terms of trade vis-a-vis      the private sector and magnifies

the requisite fiscal retrenchment.     The paper discusses the role of trade

policy (tariffs and export subsidies) in substituting for devaluation.

Generating a private-sector    surplus via interest-rate policy is shown to have

similar costs on the government    budget when the public sector has outstanding

domestic debt.

I.   Introduction

        Since the onset of the debt crisis in 1982, the requirement of prompt

debt service hss overwhelmed many other traditional objectives of government

policy in highly-indebtedcountries.        The virtusi hslt in commercial bank

                                                      to developing countries,
lending has reversed the sign of net resource inflows

necessitating the transfer abroad of several percentage points of CUP

annually.     A reverse transfer of such magnitude has required a retrenchment in

domestic expenditures and sharp changes in relative prices, which have proved

particularly costly in terms of capital formation and (it would appear) income

distribution.

        Debt aervice typically involves two kinds of transfers.      Commonly,

foreign debt is largely the liability of the public sector, whereas the main

source of foreign exchange earnings is the private sector.         Consequently,   it

is now well-recognized that debt service entaila an internal         transfer of

resources    from the private sector to the public sector, alongside the

external transfer from the latter to foreign creditors.'         As in the two-gap

style of analysis,     the level of debt service is constrained by whichever of

the two transfers     happens to bind.    When the internal tranafer is the binding

constraint,     for example,   the inability of the government   to raise reaourcea

will be reflected in an ex-ante private-sectorsurplus, which in equilibrium

                                                                             or
may dissipate itself via such channels as capital flight, inflation,



1.    This point has been made forcefully by Jeffrey Sachs. See, for example,
Sacha   (1987, pp. 21-22).  See also Dornbusch (1985, pp. 348-352).

increased private consumption.

        Another way of atating the same issue ia that debt service entails a

public-finance problem intertwined with a transfer problem.          The economy has

to generate a surplus of traded goods, and the government has to extract

additional resources from the private sector.        The internal-transfer      aspect,

in turn, raises interesting issues for one reason alone, and that is that the

requisite fiscal retrenchment it[këly to be costly.

        Of course, the cynical view is that the burden of fiscal contraction will

be borne by scheming bureaucrats and bloated government programs,            and that it

will therefore contribute a net gain to social welfare.          But a more balanced

appraisal would be that a quick turnaround in the fiscal stance is likely to

generate important social inefficencies.        There are plenty of reasons for

this.    First, and most obviously,   any increase   in taxes will be accompanied by

their usual allocstive distortions.      On the expenditure side, since an

importsnt component of current spending is targeted on social equity

objectives,    a squeeze on such spending will likely reduce social welfare.           A

reduction in public investment expenditures,       the most likely initial casualty

of an increse in debt service obligations, will jeopardize capital formation

and future growth.     If the public sector resorts to the inflation tax and/or

domestic borrowing instead, the stage may be set either for an explosion in

inflation or for a sharp rise in real interest rates that might put the

domestic debt on an unsustainable     course.

        This paper works out some of the implications of the co-existence of the

internal transfer with the external one.        In section   II below,   I   show in the
                                             -3-


context of a simple small-open economy model how any increase in debt-service

must be accompanied by an enlarged extraction of private resources by the

public sector.     I also show that in the absence of fiscal retrenchment,          the


impact of a devaluation on debt service will be annulled by domestic

inflation,   capital     flight, or both.    Section III discusses    in more detail the

welfare costs of debt service when fiscal retrenchment is costly.             The key

point here is that the external transfer involves a neglected additional cost:

the real exchange-rate      depreciation called for by debt service deteriorates

the public sector's terms of trade vis-a-vis         the private sector, and magnifies

the requisite fiscal retrenchment.          Drawing an analogy with the literature on

the transfer problem,       debt service involves a "secondary burden" for the

domestic economy, not because the country's external terms of trade

deteriorate (which they don't in a small country context) but because the

internal terms of trade move against the public sector.

      In section   IV,   I discuss some intertemporal    issues in a two-period

version of the model.        I stress that bringing debt service forward in time has

an additional welfare cost when, as is common, the domestic interest rates

exceed the interest rates on foreign debt.          Moreover,   with pre-existing

domestic government debt, early repayment of foreign debt further deteriorates

the public sector budget (and welfare) by pushing domestic real interest rates

up.   Section V discusses the role that trade policy, and in particular tariffs

and export subsidies, can play in alleviating the welfare loss.             Not

surprisingly,    a small level of tariffs is found to be welfare enhancing,          both

because tariffs raise government revenue and because they partially substitute

for (costly) real depreciation.        Paradoxically,   however,     export subsidies can

increase welfare as well, when targeted on non-traditional exports with large
                                           -4-

supply elasticities,       since their beneficial role in substituting for real

depreciation can offset their direct budgetary burden.             Finally, section VI

provides some concluding comments.



II. The Imolicationa       of the Twin Transfers

        We start with the simplest model of a small open economy.          The economy

produces two kind of goods, traded goods (with price          e)   and non-traded goods

(with price p).        The real exchange rate is the conventional      one, given by e/p.

The government does not engage in production, nor does its behavior affect

private sector welfare directly.        Ita primary aurplua    (i.e. excluding debt

service)       as a share of gross domestic product is given by r.       In the simplest

case, we could think of this as a uniform production (or value added) tax at

rate    r.     More generally, we will not be particularly concerned with the

specification of taxes and government expenditures,       letting r denote simply

the net resource transfer from the private to the public sector (aa a share of

GDP).        The implicit asaumption here is that the government's pattern of

revenues and expenditures       (excluding debt service) match that of the private

sector.       This seems like the natural assumption to make.        In any case,   ae will

be explained below, the results hold for much more general apecificationa.

        Since the model of this section is static, we assume chat the private and

public sectors have (exogenous) debt-service requirements of               and
                                                                                 tg (in
terms of traded goods), respectively.        We let E(e, p, V) stand for the private

sector's expenditure function, with V denoting the level of private (and for

now, social) welfare.       The supply side of the economy is described by the

revenue (or COP) function R(e, p).        Then the following three equations

determine      fully the equilibrium of the economy:
                                                              -5-




(1)   E(e, p             V) —      (l-r)R(e,   p)

                                                         eB

      Re        Ee
                                                         -

(3)   rR(e, p) — eBg


The first of these states the income-expenditure                         identity for the private

sector.        The second uses the fact thst partisl derivatives                   of expenditure and

revenue functions yield the relevant (compensated) demand and supply functions

to state the balance-of payments identity.                          Notice that the private sector,

the only productive sector of the economy, has to generate the traded-goods

surplus    to service both the government and its own foreign liabilities.

Equation       (3)   ,       in   turn, states the public-sector       budget identity: the

government's primary surplus has to equal its debt service.                            The equlibriuju

condition for the non-traded goods market need not be stated separately,                            as

(by Walrss'          law) it is already implied by (l)-(3).

      Notice that since only relative prices matter, we could have stated the

system in terms of the real exchange rate (e/p) alone, as will be done in the

following sections.                    For now, I keep e and p separate, as they will have the

convenient interpretations                     of "nominal" exchange rate policy and the economy's

response to it, respectively,                       for the kind of exercises   to be carried out in

the present section.

      The system above represents three independent equations that will

determine three variables, of which V is one.                          What the other two endogenous

variables       are depends on the question of interest.                    Suppose,   the objective of

policy is to service an additional amount of public debt, dEg.                            Assume

further,       with no loss of generality (as only e/p matters),                   that p is fixed at

                 is outside the government's control.                    Then achieving the target

increase in public debt service requires not only an exchange-rate                            policy (a

real depreciation),           but an increase in r, the public aector surplus.                    In other

words,    e and r both have to be endogenously                    determined,   given   S.
        To see the nature of the interrelationships,                    we differentiate      totally (I)

-(3).     After substituting out for dy--we will return to welfare effects in the

next section--we are left with a system in two endogenous variables, e and                                  r:



                              R        de                   -e

                                                                                          -

positive since E(.) is (strictly) concave and R(.) (strictly) convex in                                a.


The real exchange rate depreciationcalled for by the increased debt service

requirement       can be cslculsted as:


                  =   (R/A)(l     -           >
(5)     de/dBg                        tcty)
This     is the conventional depreciation               required to get the economy to generate

the additional traded goods; r sppears nowhere in this expression.

        The new aspect, of course, is that alongside the depreciation,                          the


external transfer requires an increase in the public sector primary surplus:


                  —   (1/A)                  Eec) +   (l-itccy)CrRp/e)] > 0.

Using the definition of A, we note that the elasticity

the debt service requirement exceeds unity:

           (dr/r)/(dBg/Sg)


This is beacause the increase in r has two components.                      The first, labeled


(a)   ,
          is   simply the value of the additional traded goods generated in the

economy (excluding the income effect).2                    The government surplus has to rise

one-for-one to transfer these traded goods abroad.                      But, there is a second

effect,        labeled   (b),   which represents the public-sector income loss that has

to be made up as a consequence               of the deterioration of the government's terms

of trade vis-a-vis the private sector.                    This income loss is proportional to

the rate of              depreciation--compare            equation (5)--and to rR.    R is the
economy's       output of non-traded goods and r              is the   government's net claim on it

(as a share of output).               Hence, as long as the public sector's revenues from

non-traded goods exceed its expenditures on them, the real depreciation

required to generate the private-sector surplus has an additional burden on
the public budget.3             The requirement would be clearly satisfied when


government expenditures are nil, and r represents                      the economy-wide tax rate.

          More generally, we can think of             r   as a vector of "net" tax rates on

commodities,        i.e. revenues         from each group of commodities       js    expenditures.

Then, a real depreciation entails an income loss for the public sector (and an



                                                                                                     -
2.  This can be seen from the total differential of equation (2): (ReeEee)
EeVdV   dBg.  The second term on the left-hand side is the income effect on
demand for tradables.

3.  Dornbusch (1987) expresses the budget deficit in reduced form as an
increasing function of the real exchange rate, arguing that "the real value of
the service of an external debt contracted in dollars will increase when the
real exchange rate depreciates" (p. 68).   As the discussion in the text shows,
the former does not necessarily follow from the latter, as compensating
increases in real revenues (and declines in real expenditures on non-debt
items) also have to be taken into account.

offseting gain for the private aector) whenever the non-traded gooda component

of thia vector is positive.      For a government that has to generate   a primary

surplus,    this will likely be the case.4 Notice that what is tequired here is

only that non-traded goods be a source of gg. revenue for the government; with

respect to traded goods, the primary budget of the government could be either

in surplus or in deficit.5    When such is the case, then, a real depreciation

worsens    the government budget and requires an increase in the rate of taxation

(or a reduction in the level of expenditures)    to offaet   it.   We will return to

the welfare implications of this in the next section.

     Since debt service depends both on the government's     exchange-rate   policy
and on its resource-mobilization    policy, a relevant question is what happens

when the government fails on one of the two fronts.     The more interesting   case

is the one where exchange-rate    policy is not supplemented by a sufficient

increase   in the primary surplus of the government.   This is a realistic

scenario since, as shown above, the government now has to generate additional

income not only to accomplish the transfer abroad, but also to restore the




4. To see this, suppose that non-tradables make up 70 percent of the economy.
Assume, contrary to the case envisaged here, that non-tradables are not a net
source of revenue for the government.  Then, to generate a primary surplus of
five percent (of GOP), the government would have to impose a "net" tax rate of
at least 16.7 percent (O.O5/[l-O.7]) on tradables.  Of course, in countries
where government revenues derive to a large extent from exports of natural
resources, the presumption would be that the effect of real depreciations go
the other way.


5.  Of course, the overall budget identity requires that the government have a
deficit in traded goods if it has s surplus in non-traded goods. But when the
relevant budgetary concept is the primary budget (revenues and expenditures
excluding debt service), the government can, and typically will, have a
simultaneous surplus in both traded and non-traded goods.
                                             -9-

erosion of its     real   revenue base as a consequence of the real depreciation.

When such resource mobilization proves impossible, the internal transfer

becomes the binding constraint on debt service.             The question is: how does the


economy then adjust to equate the ex-post surplus of the private sector with

the ex-post transfer from it to the public sector?

        With no loss of generality,      suppose that r is now fixed.       (Any level of      r


that falls short of the requirement expressed in (6) will do.)               If the level

of public debt service       is also taken as exogenous, the system expressed
                        (ag)

in (l)-(3) clearly becomes under-determined.   There is no way to guarantee

that a pre-specified level of Bg can be transferred abroad.

        The following thought experiment illustrates the likely consequences for

the economy.       Suppose the government depreciates the "nominal"         exchange rate

(de >    0) with a view    towards acomplishing     the external transfer,    but that r

remains unchanged.        The level of public debt service,          now can be viewed as

an   endogenous consequence     of (exogenous) exchange-rate      policy.    What are the

two other endogenous variables? V is clearly one such variable.                With respect

to the other, however,       the system expressed in (l)-(3) allows us a choice of p

or         I   take up each in turn.

        Case 1: Inflation.     In the first case, we treat private sector capital

inflows/outflowsas exogenous,          but allow the nominal price of non-traded goods

to move.       The outcome is now obvious.     It   can   be checked easily that all

variables of interest (V and Bg in particular) are homogeneous of degree zero

in   prices. Therefore, the new equilibrium is given by dp/p — de/e and dBg                —



dV   * 0; exchange rate policy is undone by a proportional rise in domestic

prices,    and the initial nominal depreciation ends up transferring no

additional resources abroad.        It is inflation which eliminates         the ex-ante gap

between the private sector surplus and the (unchanged) government primary

surplus.6 In a real model like this one, the real transfer of resources

abroad remains unaffected.                But in a monetary framework,             the nominal

devaluation would be tantamount to an expansion of the money supply, and the

consequent inflation would generate some seignorage revenues.                               This in turn

would allow some incresse in the level of the external transfer, although not

by the full amount intended by the devsluation.

6.  In a discussion of Brazil's case, Cohen seems to suggest that inflation is
a symptom of a more successful adjustment on the external front than on the
internal front. This can be interpreted along the lines sketched out in the
text.  See Cohen (1988, pp. 93-94).
                                          -11-




The exchange-rate    depreciation leads to a build-up of the private sectors net

foreign assets.     There are two additive effects here moving in the same

direction.     First, the depreciation allows the private         sector to generate a


surplus of traded goods (first term in curly brackets),            which can be used for

capital flight in the abs'nce of an increased rate of taxation.                Second,   the

depreciation also increases the real income of the private sector by shrinking

the real "tax base" (second term in curly brackets)        ,   and this   net increase in

income can also be used to build up asaets abroad.             Consequently,    the


resulting capital flight is larger than the public debt-service which would

have occurred had    r   been increased alongside e.7    This is one possible

interpretation of how substantial real devaluations and trade surpluses can

co-exist,    ss in Mexico in 1984-85, with no improvement         in the overall debt

situation. 8

     One does not need s fancy dynamic model to generate this capital-flight

possibility as an equilibrium outcome of an inter-temporal            decision framework.

Suppose     the domestic interest rates are fixed by arbitrage        with foreign

capital markets.     With sluggish adjustment in p       the devslustion generates         an

ex-snte excess savings in the private sector.9          Since domestic interest rates




7.  The terminology I use here is clearly not without normative overtones:                 a
decrease in the public sector's net foreign liabilities is called "debt
service", whereas an analogous change for the private sector is called
"capital flight." This is common terminology, however.

8.   See Sachs (1987), p. 22.

9.  Of course, it is not immediately clear that the devaluation on its own
    d generate additional private savings in s dynamic framework. I consider
this case because a devaluation policy makes sense only when it does.  Perhaps
the simplest case to consider is the one with unemployed resources in the
                                            -12-

cannot fall, the excess savings are used to build up foreign assets.

     These    two cases are of course only illustrations          of the possible outcomes

that await a policy which tackles the external transfer without tackling the

internal one.    A well-intentioned    exchange rate policy can be dissipated in

inflation and/or capital flight in the absence of adequate public-sector

resource mobilization.     Significantly,    the real depreciation aggravates      the

requisite    resource mobilization,   as it deteriorates the public sector's terma

of trade via-a-via the private sector.

     In the absence of a more fully articulated model, it is impossible            to

tell exactly what combination of inflation and capital flight will actually

occur.     In particular, a serious treatment of capital flight requires an

intertemporal framework.     Nonetheless,    the central point is clear even in this

simple framework: when it is not accompanied by fiscal tightening, the

"appropriate"   exchange-rate   policy can end up validating an ex-ante motive for

capital flight, and be inflationary.



III. Welfare Consequences    of Debt Service

     The previous section analyzed the circumatancea          under which a specified

level of debt service could be accomplished.           The present section concentrates

on the welfare consequences of doing so.           Accordingly,   in what follows I will

assume that the requisite public-sector resource mobilization always takes



economy.  The devaluation would then spur domestic income and increase
savings.  Alternatively, the devaluation could be viewed as a temporary
increase in the price of traded goods, in which case consumers would want to
transfer some of their consumption to the second period provided the
intertemporal elasticity of substitution is sufficiently larger than the
intra-temporal substitution elasticity. See Svenaaon and Razin (1983) for a
discussion of the issues.
                                            -13-

           The question I pose   is:   what is the welfare cost of an additional unit
place.

of debt service, when fiscal retrenchment is a source of social inefficiency?

      The previous section did not explicitly allow for changes in             r   to have


direct welfare consequences.       As pointed out in the introduction,         the nature


of the costs imposed by ai increase in r is generally a source of debate.

These costs can range all the way from the traditional allocative distortions

                                                             shifts in
imposed by tax wedges to wider political costs engendered by
                                              and income distribution.       Given the
governmental priorities, entitlements,
broad spectrum of issues involved here,           I   prefer to take an agnostic view and

model these costs in a general but ad-hoc manner.              I write social welfare as

follows:



(9)   W — V   -
                  (r),      '   > 0,    '   > 0.


The cost    of fiscal tightening enters additively in the social welfare

function.     This implies that, as a first approximation,           the impact of fiscal

                                                       For all its disadvantages,    this
policy on relative prices can be ignored.

specification avoids misplaced concreteness of the sort that would prevail had

we attributed the costs to a well-specified,             but particular source.

      The rest of the model remains as before, with three cosmetic changes.

First, we arbitrarily     set the price of traded goods to unity, with p now

denoting the inverse of the real exchange rate.              Second, we denote by B the

total debt service requirement of the economy, with -               the public sector's

share in it.       I will treat both B and    y   parametrically.     Third, we replace the

                                                                   the non-
balance-of-payments identity with the condition for equilibrium in
                                                                 -14-

traded goods market.                      The rest of the model can now he written as follows:



(10)    E(l, p           V) —        (l-r)R(l,     p)   -   (1-7)3

(11)            -        —   0

(12)    rR(l,       p)    — -yE.


The four endogenous variables are p, r, V                                    and W.

       We investigate the consequences of an increase in the debt-service

obligations of the economy.                        As discussed in the previoua section, the real

exchange rate has to depreciate, and the analogue of expression                                           (5)   in the

present context ia:


(13)    dp/dB —          -[p(R            -

Here         is the share of non-trsdsbles
                                       production in GDP, and cny is the income

elasticity of demand for non-tradsbles.   The change in private welfare is


given by:


(14)    dV/dB — -A C 0,


where A (—          1tv          is the orivate marginal utility of income.                             Eut social

welfare is also a function of what happens to                                   r:




(15)    dW/dB — dV/dE                 -
                                          'dr/dB
                    —    -(A     +    ('/R)[y      -
                                                        r%(dp/dB)J} <           -A    < 0.


where dp/dB is as expressed in (13)                          .   The expression              in curly   brackets   can be

interpreted         as the social marginal utility of income, and is higher than the

private marginal utility of income beceause transferring resources from the

private to the public sector is costly.                                 Notice that the wedge between the
                                             -15-


private and social valuations of income has two components.          One psrt has to

do with the direct increase in the requisite internal transfer, and is

proportional to    -y,   the ahare of the public sector in total    foreign

liabilities.     The other part captures the social valuation of the public

sector's real income loss as a result of the real depreciation,          and is

proportional to the rate of the depreciation.

      Therefore,   the social cost of debt service is magnified whenever the

public sector holds foreign debt, or when non-rradables are a net source of

revenue for the public sector.        Typically both set of circumstances     will

apply.   The determinants of the magnitude of the welfare cost can be read from

(13) and (15): the welfare cost of debt service increases          with the share of

debt held by the public sector       (-y),   the size of the primary surplus of the


government,    and the share of non-traded goods in the economy; it decreases

with the extent of price-responsivenessin the economy.

      There is an interesting parallel here with the literature         on the transfer

problem.10 It is well-known from this literature that a transfer from one

country to another involves a "secondary burden" for the donor country insofar

as the transfer requires a deterioration in its terms-of-trade,          which it will

if the sum of the marginal propensities to import fall short of unity.               Here

there is a similar secondary burden, except that this arises from a change not

in the external terma of trade, but in the internal rerms of trade.            When

fiscal retrenchment is costly, a unit of income in the public sector is

                                                                               The

problem with the real depreciation is that it transfers income in the wrong

IV. The Role of Domestic Debt

        The secondary burden of debt service does not arise solely from a real

exchange rate depreciation.        A rather similar scenario is played out, for a

different    reason, when the government has a pre-existing stock of domestic

debt.     To see this, we now turn to an alternative mechanism for generating a

private sector surplus: an increase in the domestic real interest rate.

Typically,    real interest rates will be jacked up alongside devaluations,               but

in the present section we will look at the first alone.              cJe   will see that the

requisite    rise in interest rates deteriorates the public sector's terms of

trade in much the same way that a real depreciation does.

        To abstract from real exchange rate movements,          I simplify the model above


by lumping traded and non-traded goods into a single domestic good.                 The

inclusion of a second period (the future), to capture simple savings dynamics,

compensates    for the simplification.       Therefore      the modified model still has

two goods: today's goods and tomorrow's            goods.   The relative price of future

goods is denoted by 6, which is also the economy's real discount factor (one

over one plus the real consumption rate of interest).               The government enters


period one with a pre-exiating net stock of domestic debt D0, which comes due

in the second (and last) period.           It can undertake an additional       amount D of

new domestic borrowing (or amortization if D is negative) during period one.

The private sector cannot borrow from or lend abroad.

        Under these conditions, the model is given by:


(16)     E(l, 6, V) —   (1-r1)q1   +   &(l-r2)q2   +
                                                                      17-

(17)    q1    -            —    9B

(18)    r1q1       +   D    —

(19)    r2q2 — (D+D0)/5 +                    (19)B/5*.

By   appeal       to full employment, we fix the level of output in the two periods

q1 and q2.             B refers to the outstanding stock of foreign debt held by the

public sector; 9                 is    the share which comes due in the first period.                            Equation

(17)   is    the goods-market equilibrium for the first period; the analogous

expression for the second period can be left out because of Walras' law.

Equations         (18) and (19) are the public sector budget constraints for the two

periods, with                    and         denoting the respective primary surpluses                         (as a share

of GDP)           Since         the    foreign     real    interest         rate        can differ from the domestic

one, different              discount factors apply to domestic and foreign debt in

expression (19).                  Notice         that there are five possible endogenous variables

here   (V,    6,    D, r1, and r2), but                   only   four equations.               It   is   convenient to use

the extra degree of freedom to set                                    —       —    r.     This does not restrict the

governments ability to shift resources from one period to the other, as this

can still be achieved via changes in D.                                     Alternatively,       we could have fixed

     to examine the implications of debt service for the long-run level of

fiscal stringency.                     The qualitative results discussed below are not affected

by the "normalization' we select here.

       In this intertemporal framework, the relevant question to pose about the

burden of debt service is: what are the consequences of a shift forward in

time of the stream of service payments?                                     Earlier repayment of foreign debt car

be here captured by an increase in                             6.         The implications          for welfare are then
                                                -18-


easy to calculate:

                               - 1JB,
(20)   dV/dO —    A((5/6*)

where A is once again the (private) marginal utility of income.                  The term in


square brackets can also be written as (r*
                                                       -
                                                           r)/(l+r) with
                                                                     ,      r* and r standing

for the foreign and domestic            (real) interest rates, respectively.       As long as

domestic interest rates exceed the world rate- -or, more precisely,                the average

rate on foreign liabilities- -earlier repayment of debt is welfare worsening.

The reason is straightforward:           the present value of repayments discounted at

the domestic rate of interest            jg,   even though it remains constant when

discounted at     S.       Put differently, with r >       r*,   the home country is borrowing

too little in the first period to begin with; a larger resource transfer early

on exacerbates      this distortion.

       The effect on the domestic interest rate can be found similarly:


(21)    di       (l/E12)    [Me   + E1vdV]


the sign of which is in general ambiguous as the -substitution and income

effects go in opposite directions.             On the one hand, the increase in      I



requires a larger first-period private surplus, which can be generated only if

S   falls    (r rises).     On the other, as consumer wealth is now lower, there is

reduced consumption and increased savings in the first period.                  Provided r and

     are aufficiently close to each other, it is reasonable to suppose that the

first effect dominates end that the domestic (real) interest rate increases.

                                            on the fiscal stance:
       Finally, we can solve for the effect

Note the effects labeled (a) snd                 (b)   which identify the two sources of the

requisite fiscal tightening.               First, earlier repayment of foreign debt

deteriorates the government budget because the domestic real interest rate

facing the government is higher than the corresponding one on the external

debt.     Secondly,    the rise in real interest rates implies a secondary burden                    on.


the government budget as long as                ggg     domestic debt is carried over ro the

second period (D+D > 0) (Cohen, 1988, p. 88).                      On both accounts, government

"wealth" declines,         and has to be restored by an increase in the primary

surplus.     The social welfare consequences                  can be evaluated by using an

equation like    (9)   ,   but    the losses are already evident.




V. Is There a Role for Trade Policy?

        Since debt service         involves simultaneously         a public-finance    and a

tranafer problem, optimal government policy has two components:                       (a)   a real

depreciation must be engineered to generate an excess supply of tradables; and

(h) the tax structure            must be re-designed to raise the government resources

needed for public debt service at least cost.                     Of course, as the reel

depreciation will, in general, interact with the optimal tax structure,                         these

two steps are not independent.                  But conceptually     the internal transfer

requires solving an optimal tax problem of the sort that is familiar from the

public-finance literature            (e.g. Newbery and Stern, 1987, chaps. 2-3).               The

optimal tax structure thereby obtained will not, except for in rare

circumstances,    involve trade taxes              (see Dixit, 1985).
                                           -20-

      But in practice we are unlikely to face optimal tax structures in place;

nor is re-optimizationlikely to be easy with every increase in the debt-

service burden.     Moreover,   governments do frequently resort to trade policies

for revenue reasons,     largely due to their relative administrative    ease.        So

the extent to which trade policies can be used effectively to reduce some of

the welfare costs identified above should atill be of relevance.         Put


differently,    it is of interest to know if there are any         arguments    for

trade policy in the present context.        In analyzing this question below, I will

ignore the interactions between trade policies and distortions created by

other pre-exiating taxes.11

      It is clear that a moderate level of tariffs can now be welfare

enhancing.     In the first instance, this is becauae tariffs raise revenue for

the government.12 But there is also a aecond reaaon for why tariffs would be

beneficial:    by raising the relative price of importables, tariffa partially

substitute for real exchange rate depreciations.         Put differently, an increase

in tariffs allows a smaller real depreciation to generate the same amount of

surplus   in traded goods.      Since depreciations   are costly because they

deteriorate    the public sector's terms of trade, this is another rationale           for


the   use of tariffs.     Interestingly,   this rationale also creates a role for


export subsidies.       On impact, a subsidy of course deteriorates the

government's budget.       But, just like a tariff, an export subsidy reduces the




11.  This can be justified by considering that when the pre-exiating tax
structure is not "optimal" the welfare effects of such interactions could go
either way.

12.  Edwards (1988) stresses the conflict between tariff reductions and fiscal
adjustment when tariff revenuea are an important part of government resources.
                                                             -21-

magnitude of the requisite real depreciation.                              When the subsidy is targeted on

  marginal"     exports with high supply elasticities,                          the second effect dominates

and welfare is unambiguously increased.                             The present section demonstrates

these points.

        We return to the one-period model of section III, but distinguish                                    now

between importables and exportables.                         The modified model becomes:



(9)       W —   V   -
                        (r)
(10')     E(1+s, 1+t, p          V) —   (1-r)R(l+s,           l+t, p)      -
                                                                               (1--y)B

(12')     rR(l+s, l+t, p) +                    -         -           -         — yB
                                    t(E2           R2)       s(R1        E1)

The export subsidy and the tariff are denoted by s and                                t,   respectively.
Notice that the public sector budget has to be adjusted for tariff revenues

and subsidy payments.             In what follows, we perform comparative statics around

an intial equilibrium where s—t—O.

        Consider first the role of export subsidies.                            As before, we define the

real exchange rate as l/p.13                   An instructive intermediate result is obtained

when we look at the effects of the subsidy on the real exchange rate:


(23)    dp      (R      -
                            E)(E1          -

                                                R1)ds        > 0.


As before,
                (R      -

                            E)   is positive.             The term
                                                                          (E1
                                                                                 -

                                                                                     R1)   represents    the

increase     in the excess demand,              or conversely the reduction in the excess

supply,    of the exportable as the real exchange rate appreciates                               (i.e.   ,   p



13.  The "effective" real exchange rate would of course also incorporate the
price effects of tariffs and subsidies.  In the present context, we want to
distinguish between the effects of exchange rate and trade policies.
                                                                -22-

increases),      and we would normally expect it to be positive.                                        Consequently,     the


effect of the subsidy is to increase                            p,      or to appreciate the real exchange

rate.     The requisite change in                       r   is in turn given by:


(24)     dr —   (l/R)f((l-r)R1                 -

The second term in the square brackets is the familiar terms-of-trade                                               effect

from real exchange rate changes.                             Now, however, this effect goes in the other

direction,      as the real rate appreciates.                             On this account alone, the aubsidy

allows a reduction in                r.

                                                                                              -
        How about the sign of the first term, ((l-r)R1                                            E1)? This term capturea
the direct revenue effect of the subsidy: there is a revenue loss which equals

                        Li

The implication is that the sign of the fiscal correction expressed                                             in (24) is


indeterminate.          But there is the possibility that a small subsidy will ease

the budgetary burden, if the price elasticities of the exportable (see [23J)
                                                -23-

and the share of non-tradables           in GDP (see [24]) are sufficientlyhigh.

       With a slight re-interpretationof our model, we can in fact obtain a

more informative result.           Let us think of good one as a specific exportable,

rather than all exportables.             in the absence of tariffs   good two then becomes

a tradable composite of other exportables and of the importables.              The export

subsidy in question applies only to the specific commodity singled out as good

one.    With this interpretation,         we can investigate the consequences of a small

subsidy on a subset of exportables.

       To fix ideas, consider a subsidy on a marginal"           exportable,   that is a

commodity which at the old relative prices stood at zero excess supply.

Therefore   initially R1       -     —   0, and it must be the case that


       (l-r)R1
                 -      < 0,


which now implies that dr/ds < 0 on account of both terms in (24).              The

interpretation       is as follows.      A small export subsidy on commodities that are

at the margin of being exported leads to negligible subsidy payments.                 In

fact, because it raises the domestic market price of these commodities,                the


subsidy actually generates          some net revenues.    Consequently,   a targeted

program of export subsidies can reduce the budgetary burden through this

channel as well as through the induced effects of real appreciation.               The

argument is of course generally valid for all commodities with small initial

shares in total exports.           Note further that the welfare impact of the resource

misallocation caused by a small subsidy is of second-order magnitude,              compared

to the effect of the reduction in r.             Hence we can conclude that a moderate

amount of export subsidization of non-traditional            exports, particularly those

with high price elasticities,            is likely to be desirable as a complement to a
                                                    -24-


devaluation-cum-fiscal-stringency             package.14

       We can now turn to tariffs.            The second-best          argument for small tariffs

is similar to the one sketched out above for subsidies,                          and is of course


stronger insofar as tariffs unambiguously                     raise revenue for the government.


Starting once again from an intial equilibrium with s—t—O, the response of p

to changes in the tariff level is given by:


(26)    dp —     (R E)(E2
                        -              -
                                            R2)dt    > 0.


The term            -                        the increase in the excess demand for the
            (E2         R2)   represents

importable      as the real exchange rate appreciates                  (i.e., p increases), and it

is normally positive.           The effect on       r   is:



         dr —    (l/R)[((l-r)R2 -     E2)dt    -
(27)                                               rRdp),

which is now unambiguously negative since (R2                         E2) < 0.
                                                                  -




        One final aspect of        tra1de   policy worth discussion is the role of

quantitative restrictions.            Quotas, like tariffs, would tend to substitute for

real depreciations          and would therefore have similar benefits.                  But from the


present pespective,           quotas have two important shortcomings.                 First, and most

obviously,       they generate no direct revenue for the government in the likely

case of no auctioning.           Secondly,     they transform what are essentially traded

goods    into non-traded goods by breaking the price                    linkages with foreign

markets.        Consequently,    a smaller share of net government revenue remains



14.  The second-best package will involve a differentiatedstructure of export
subsidies, along the lines of the inverse-elasticityrule.   The general case
can be worked out by indexing different exportables, and setting dW/dsi — 0
for each commodity.  But the general formulation yields no additional insight.
                                            -25-

"indexed"   to traded goods and the welfare cost of real depreciations         are


magnified (see equation [13] and the accompanying discussion).            For these

reasons,    a conversion of quotas to tariffs will ease the future burden of the

internal transfer.



VI.   Concluding   Remarks

        The conventional advice to a country having to generate a resource

transfer abroad is to depreciate the home currency in real terms.            It is

frequently neglected that such depreciations tend to have serious consequences

for the fiscal balance.      As long as non-tradables     are a net source of revenue

for the government, e reel depreciation amounts to a real income loss for the

public sector, which has to be compensated by a fiscal tightening over and

above    the magnitude of the external     transfer.   Paradoxically,   by worsening the

terms at which the government extracts resources out of the private sector, a

devaluation can make it harder for the external transfer to be accomplished.

A rather similar outcome obtains when real interest rates are raised to

generate a private sector surplus.        The increased interest burden on the


government's domestic debt amounts to a terms-of-trade          deterioration via-a-via

the private sector.

        Once the fiscal constraint is taken into account, room is created for

some unorthodox policy combinations.         In particular,   trade policies that


supplement devaluations by promoting exports and restricting imports can be

shown, when judiciously      employed,   to increase welfare.    These policies now

have a role to play, not just because they may raiae revenue for the
                                       -26-


government,   but because they allow a foreign-exchange   surplus to be

accumulated without exacerbating the debt-service burden in terms of domestic

currency

        To express              the solutions,      some further notation is helpful.           First, let

            stand for the lxn row vectors of cross derivatives                              of exportables
  e and Rpe

with respect to the price of non-tradables.                          Then let Rpm and Rpm stand for

the lxm row vectors of analogous cross derivatives                           for the importables.         Rae

and Eee, and                     and   E    are nxn and mxm matrices, respectively,            of cross-

derivatives            within the exportables group.               And Rem       Rem are the nxm

matrices of cross-derivatives                       across importables and exportables.             Finally,

We can solve for the second-best structure of tariffs and export subsidies

using this framework.             When all tariffs are initially zero, for example, the

optimal structure of export subsidies is implicitly defined by:


       dW —      ([A*   +                                     -

where the superscript T indicates the transpose of a vector.                           A* here is the

social marginal utility of income, and is defined ss follows:


             —   E(l + (/R)[sTEeW c;E(rR       -                  -
