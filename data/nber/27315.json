    "abstract": "\n\nI use Current Population Survey Data from February and April 2020 to examine how individual workers have transitioned between labor-market states and which workers have been hurt most by the COVID-19 pandemic. I find not only large effects on workers becoming unemployed but also a decline in labor-force participation, an increase in absence from one\u2019s job, and a decrease in hours worked. Generally, more vulnerable populations\u2014racial and ethnic minorities, those born outside the U.S., women with children, the least educated, and workers with a disability\u2014have experienced the largest declines in the likelihood of (full-time) work and work hours.\n\n",
