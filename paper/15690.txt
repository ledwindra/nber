Is the Spurious Regression Problem Spurious?

NBER Working Paper No. 15690

JEL No. C22,C29
ABSTRACT
So-called “spurious regression” relationships between random-walk (or strongly autoregressive) variables
are generally accompanied by clear signs of severe autocorrelation in their residuals. A conscientious
researcher would therefore not end an investigation with such a result, but would likely re-estimate
with an autocorrelation correction. Simulations show, for several typical cases, that the test-rejection
statistics for the re-estimated relationships are very close to the true values, so do not yield results
of the spurious type.

1. Introduction
Ever since the publication of the famous Granger-Newbold (1974) paper, students and
practitioners of econometrics have been warned of the dangers of obtaining spurious regression
findings, i.e., results suggesting the presence of significant relationships among time series
variables when in fact no such relationship is present in the data-generating process (population)
under study. Such a danger is present, it is shown, when a pair (for example) of variables, xt and
yt, are both generated by processes that are random walks. Thus, even when these processes (and
their generated series) are entirely unrelated, regressions of yt on xt (or xt on yt) will with high
probability indicate the presence of a significant relationship—one whose probability of
occurrence actually increases with increasing sample size. This undesirable phenomenon
continues to prevail, moreover, when the xt and yt variables are more complex differencestationary processes—i.e., not pure random walks—and even when they are trend-stationary but
strongly autoregressive; see Granger (2001) and Granger, Hyund, and Jeon (2001). Discussions
appear even in introductory econometrics textbooks; recent examples include those in Stock and
Watson (2007), Hill, Griffiths, and Lim (2008), and Wooldridge (2006).
In an obscure paper considering related issues, McCallum (1993, pp. 27-34) has argued
that concern for autocorrelated residuals is crucial in alleged cases of spurious correlation. His
position is that in any time series study an investigator with even elementary training in
econometrics should not—and presumably would not—be satisfied with a regression in which
strong serial correlation of the residuals is apparent, especially in cases in which the estimated
relation includes a lagged endogenous variable as a regressor. At a minimum, a conscientious
and competent investigator faced with such autocorrelation would naturally re-estimate the
relation while including some “correction” such as the iterated Cochrane-Orcutt (1949)

procedure. In cases similar to the basic Granger-Newbold (1974) examples, it is suggested, the
spurious findings of nonexistent relationships will tend to be eliminated by this procedure. 1 The
situation is somewhat less clear-cut in the case of integrated moving-average variables, but again
taking account of autocorrelated residuals tends to eliminate spurious relationships.
2. Basic Results
To provide support for McCallum’s 1993 argument, which is more suggestive than
conclusive, consider the simulation results reported in Table 19.1 of Davidson and MacKinnon
(1993). There the standard case of a spurious regression between two independently-generated
random-walk variables is examined in that table’s column 2, which shows much greater rejection
frequencies than the actual 0.05 for the true hypothesis of a zero slope coefficient—this is the
spurious finding. 2 For convenience, we report several of the Davidson and MacKinnon
frequencies in the first row of Table 1 below, where T designates sample size for the regressions
studied via numerous replications. Of course we cannot use the same data as that generated by
Davidson and MacKinnon, but we have generated results using the same simulation setup. Our
rejection frequencies, analogous to those of Davidson and MacKinnon, are shown in row 2; they
indicate clearly that our simulation study reproduces the incorrect rejections noted by Davidson
and MacKinnon. 3 Then in row 3, we report the fraction of times in which the regressions’ DW
(Durbin-Watson, 1951) statistics are below 1.0, a value that implies extremely strong autocorrelation of the estimated residuals. As is clear from the table, almost all of the regressions in
the Davidson and MacKinnon version of the basic Granger-Newbold example feature very

1

Actually, the argument developed in McCallum (1993) is more general in scope; it is to the effect that one can
analyze many relationships by using either levels or first differences of variables so long as care is taken to have
residuals that are not autocorrelated. The spurious regression application amounts to a special case. Hamilton
(1994, p. 562) briefly mentions a similar suggestion, which appears in an unpublished paper by Stephen R. Blough.

strong autocorrelation. So next we ask, “What would happen if the econometrician re-estimated
his equation using some standard technique such as iterated Cochrane-Orcutt?” In Table 1, row
4 reports results based on calculations provided by the “AR(1)” procedure built into EViews. 4
As can be seen, when the simulated equation is estimated using the E-Views specification of an
AR(1) disturbance, rather than presuming white noise disturbances, the proportion of rejection
frequencies falls to 0.0875 and 0.0659 for sample sizes of T = 50 and T = 100, and to values very
close to the true 0.050 for larger sample sizes. This is our basic result.
The last two rows of Table 1 repeat the foregoing comparison but with the true
significance level set at 0.01, rather than 0.05. Thus the fifth row reports the rejection frequency
when no notice is taken of the serially correlated residuals, in the same manner (but with a 2.576
critical value) as in row 2. Clearly, the same tendency to reject the (true) hypothesis of no
relationship occurs as in row 2. But again the fraction of cases with DW statistics less than 1.0 is
1.000 for all sample sizes above 50 (and is 0.9929 in that case). So again we alter the regressions
by inclusion of the EViews AR(1) procedure, with results reported in the final row. And again
the rejection frequencies are reasonably close to the true 0.01 value for sample sizes of 50 and
100, and are quite close for larger sample sizes. Thus the evidence provided by these two
examples suggests that the “spurious regression” phenomenon is actually not a matter of major
concern when there is no evidence of autocorrelated residuals. In that argument I am of course
assuming that the estimated relationship is correctly specified in terms of the variables and lags
included. If it is not, omitted variable problems may be serious—an important but distinct matter.
3. Case With Stationary Series
More recent papers by Granger (2001) and Granger, Hyung, and Jeon (2001) have
4

The EViews AR(1) estimation procedure differs somewhat from the iterative Cochrane-Orcutt procedure. In
particular, it assumes an AR(1) disturbance process for the estimated regression and then uses nonlinear estimation
of parameters, including the AR parameter, as discussed by Davidson and MacKinnon (1993, pp. 331-341).

emphasized that spurious estimated relationships occur not only between (or among) randomwalk or “integrated” variables, but also stationary but highly autocorrelated time series variates.
Consequently, Davidson and MacKinnon (2004, p. 611) have included results analogous to those
of theirs reported above but with the two basic series generated not by random walks, but by
first-order autoregressive (AR) processes, using an AR parameter value of 0.8. In this case the
Davidson and MacKinnon rejection values are reported only in graphical, not numerical, form so
the reporting of them in row one of Table 2, below, can be only approximate. The values from
my own 10,000 simulations given in row two are, however, in full accord. These rejection
frequencies do not rise with sample size, as in the random-walk cases of Table 1, but are greater
than 1/3 in all of our simulations—over six times as large as the true rejection probability. But,
as before, almost all of the test regressions have DW statistic values smaller than 1.0.
Accordingly, we again consider the outcomes that occur when the investigator employs the
EViews AR(1) procedure when regressing one of the AR series on the other. Clearly, row three
shows that with this adjustment the rejection frequencies become close to the true values built
into the simulation study. Furthermore, the same comments apply to the cases shown in rows 4
and 5, in which the true rejection probability is 0.01, rather than 0.05. Thus these results, like
those in Table 1, support our suggestion that the “spurious regression” phenomenon is actually
not a matter of concern when account is taken of autocorrelated disturbances
4. Integrated Moving-Average Series
In a somewhat neglected passage in their 1977 book, Forecasting Economic Time Series,
Granger and Newbold (1977, pp. 207-214) have anticipated the argument of the preceding
sections to the effect that conscientious researchers will make adjustments when encountering
evidence of autocorrelated residuals. They have gone on to argue, however, that in the case of

4

time series variables generated by integrated moving-average processes (rather than random
walk or AR(1) processes), re-estimation while including first-order autoregressive disturbances
will not suffice to eliminate spurious relationships. Their Table 6.6 on their page 214 indicates
that with MA parameters from 0.2 to 0.8 for the two series, rejection frequencies are in many
cases in the range 0.15-0.30 rather than the true 0.05. 5 This finding is for the sample size of T =
50 and 1000 replications. A representative rejection frequency for the case with both MA
parameters equal to 0.6 is shown in the first row of Table 3. In the second row, results for
various sample sizes and 10,000 replications are reported; these indicate that the spurious
relationship does not disappear when larger samples are utilized. 6 This finding is consistent with
the Granger-Newbold argument.
It is the case, however, that strong indications of serially-correlated residuals are present
in the regressions reported in row 2. Even DW statistics, despite being inappropriate for the type
of correlation in question, show considerable evidence suggestive of departures from white
noise. 7 More conclusively, rows 3 and 4 show the frequency with which added terms,
representing disturbances with AR(2) or MA(1) components, as well as the AR(1) component
assumed in row 2, yield t-statistics greater than 1.96 in absolute value. Accordingly, the
researcher might sensibly re-estimate the relationship with a MA(1) term added. 8 In that case,
the frequency of rejection for the hypothesis of no relation between the X and Y series is shown
5

Here MA parameters are positive under the specification yt = yt-1 + vt − θvt-1; the notational conventions of Granger
and Newbold have them negative.
6
The rejection frequency reported for T = 50 differs quantitatively from that of Granger and Newbold because of a
somewhat different autoregressive correction and/or the smaller number of replications in their study. Qualitatively,
the procedure used here yields similar results to those shown in the Granger-Newbold table.
7
The fraction of DW values differing from 2.0 by more than 0.5 grows from 0.1535 with T = 50 to 0.9997 with T =
1000.
8
If both the AR(2) and MA(1) terms are included, the latter is significant a much greater fraction of the time with
sample sizes of 100 and larger. Indeed, with sizes of 250 and greater, the MA(1) term is significant on almost every
run (9999 out of 10,000 for T = 250, and all cases with T = 500 or 1000) while the AR(2) term’s rejection frequency
is approximately equal to its true significance level. If nevertheless the AR(2) term is included instead of the
MA(2), as in row 3, the rejection frequencies for the spurious xt variable, comparable to those in row 5 of Table 3,
are: 0.1126, 0.1051, 0.0920, 0.0817, 0.0704.

5

for different sample sizes in row 5. Clearly, we again find the outcome that spurious indications
of a nonexistent relation are not frequent with samples of size 50 or 100 and are basically absent
with the larger samples.
5. Conclusions
Let us conclude with a very brief restatement of the argument. Our main point is that
“spurious regression” relationships between random-walk or strongly autoregressive variables
are generally accompanied by clear signs of severe autocorrelation in the residuals of the
estimated relationships; then re-estimation taking account of potential autocorrelation tends to
eliminate the appearance of non-existent relationships. This is shown to be the case by
simulation studies for both random-walk and autoregressive cases of the relevant time-series
variables. The argument is that any investigator with even minimal training in econometrics
would/should not conclude a time-series regression study with (e.g.) a Durbin-Watson statistic of
less than 1.0. Then re-estimation with a standard autocorrelation “correction” is shown to result
in test statistics that are, with even moderate sample sizes, very close to true significant levels. If
the relevant time-series variables come from integrated moving-average processes, the simple
first-order autoregressive correction is not adequate. But evidence of correlated residuals is
present in this case as well, and re-estimation assuming ARMA(1,1) disturbances goes a long
way toward elimination of the problem. Accordingly, it appears that, for reasonably careful
econometricians, the spurious regression problem is itself arguably spurious. 9

It has not been shown that highly autocorrelated residuals are a feature of all cases in which non-existent
relationships may spuriously appear to be present. The types of cases that that have been considered here—
independent series that are random walks, or first-order autoregressive with large positive AR parameters, or
integrated first-order moving-average series—are, however, those that are predominant in the literature.
