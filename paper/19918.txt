ABSTRACT
This paper reports results from a laboratory experiment that investigates the Meltzer-Richard model
of equilibrium tax rates, inequality, and income redistribution. We also extend that model to incorporate
social preferences in the form of altruism and inequality aversion. The experiment varies the amount
of inequality and the collective choice procedure to determine tax rates. We report four main findings.
First, higher wage inequality leads to higher tax rates. The effect is significant and large in magnitude.
Second, the average implemented tax rates are almost exactly equal to the theoretical ideal tax rate
of the median wage worker. Third, we do not observe any significant differences in labor supply or
average implemented tax rates between a direct democracy institution and a representative democracy
system where tax rates are determined by candidate competition. Fourth, we observe negligible deviations
from labor supply behavior or voting behavior in the directions implied by altruism or inequality aversion.

Introduction

In the US and other democratic countries, taxes are decided by a democratic political process, and
income tax policy in particular has enormous redistributive consequences. Much of the expenditures
that are financed by income taxes are either almost entirely redistributive, such as Food Stamps
or Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or have significant redistributive components, such as
subsidies to education (college loans, head start, work study), public transit, and health insurance.
These expenditures are generally aimed at benefiting lower income members of society, while the
costs of these programs are borne in proportion to income (or, under progressive taxation, more than
proportionally to income). However, standard economic analysis implies that, unless the elasticity
of labor supply with respect to after-tax wages is zero for all individuals, this redistribution comes
at a cost. Thus, on the one hand, income taxes reduce inequality, which is generally regarded to
be a positive improvement to society, but on the other hand, taxes may negatively affect efficiency
of the economy through distortions in the labor market. This fundamental equity-efficiency tradeoff
drives much of the political debate and polarization over economic policy, which is considered by most
political scientists to be the primary dimension of political competition in modern democracies.1
There is now a rather well developed and rigorous, equilibrium-based theory addressing the positive question of how the level of income taxes are determined in the democratic society, starting with
the work of Romer (1975), Roberts (1977) and Meltzer and Richard (1981). These models are based
on the median voter theory developed by Black (1958) and Downs (1957).2 The equity-efficiency
tradeoff in these models is captured by a distortion to labor supply created by a gap between the
after-tax wage and a worker’s marginal productivity. The heterogeneity in the agents’ productivities
is the driving force behind inequality in the pre-tax incomes in these models, as it is in the model
we study in the present paper. While the theoretical implications of these models have potentially
enormous economic consequences, both in terms of inequality level in society and economic efficiency,
as an empirical matter, these theories are extremely difficult to test using macro field and historical
data sets.
Not only is such data relatively limited, but there are open methodological issues about the
extent to which these studies enable one to draw causal conclusions, as well as the deeper problem
of endogeneity of the economic and political variables using historical or contemporary data. For
example, one basic implication of these median voter models of tax policy is that, all else equal,
greater pre-tax inequality will lead to higher taxes. At the same time the model predicts that, all else
equal, higher taxes will lead to a decline in aggregate output. Besides causality issues, it is hard to pin
down exactly which policies are redistributive, or more precisely, how much redistribution is associated
with various policies. Moreover, the key variables, inequality, taxes, and income are all endogenous
and causally intertwined. For cross-national studies, political institutions vary across countries, and
in none of the systems are tax rates determined by ”pure” majority rule vote. Rather there are a
variety of ways of deciding taxes, ranging from decisions made by elected representatives to highly
decentralized systems that more closely resemble referenda.
There have been a number of careful studies that acknowledge these difficulties and attempt to
overcome them. Unfortunately, taken collectively, these studies have led to ambiguous, and sometimes
conflicting conclusions. Several studies attempt to test the median voter tax hypothesis, which states
that the tax rate and/or government expenditures in democracies will correspond to the ideal level of
public expenditure of the median voter. Meltzer and Richard (1983) test this with data on their categorization of redistributive expenditures in the U.S. between 1936 and 1977, excluding expenditures
on public goods such as public safety, defense, and infrastructure. They don’t find direct evidence for
1

See, for example, McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal (2006).
The present paper focuses primarily on behavioral and positive questions about the political-economic equilibrium
that determines tax policy, rather than normative concerns about optimal tax rates. Thus we explore a different set of
questions than is addressed in the literature on incentive efficient tax schemes, pioneered by Mirlees (1971).

the hypothesis, but find that purely redistributive expenditures are positively correlated with the ratio
of mean to median income. Milanovic (2000), in a cross-sectional study of 24 democracies, also finds
that income redistribution to the poor correlates with measures of income inequality, but finds little
support for the median voter hypothesis. On the other hand, Perotti (1996), in his cross-sectional
study of 67 countries, does not find significant evidence for a positive relationship between inequality
and middle class tax rates. Thus, the overall picture is one of mixed empirical findings. While some
of the findings are suggestive of a link that would be consistent with the median voter hypothesis, the
link is tenuous and does not help identify the mechanism by which the median voters preferences are
implemented in the political process.
In spite of the inconclusive empirical evidence, there is a widespread consensus about the importance of the interdependence between agents’ behavior in economical and political domains. Indeed,
labor supply crucially depends on the amount of taxation imposed by the political process and, viceversa, indirect preferences of an agent for the level of taxation and redistribution crucially depend
upon the agent’s beliefs about labor market behavior of other agents. For instance, low income agents
might prefer lower tax rates if they believe that richer agents might drastically reduce labor when
taxes are higher. While the theoretical literature has long recognized the necessity to study the interplay between market behavior of heterogeneous agents and their indirect preferences for redistribution
expressed in the political arena, empirical studies of this interdependence are inconclusive.3
The experiment we report in this paper explores questions about the equity-efficiency tradeoff
vis-a-vis redistributive taxation, the equilibrium effect of wage inequality on income tax rates, and
the median voter hypothesis about the political economy consequences of voting over taxes. Our
laboratory environment is designed to correspond to the Meltzer-Richard model. The individuals
participating in our experiment operate in two interconnected environments: a political environment,
where the level of taxation is determined, and a labor market (economic environment), in which,
given an income tax schedule, individuals with varying wage rates choose labor supply that generates
pre-tax income. Because of the redistributive effect of income taxation and because individuals differ
in their productivities and hence their incomes, individuals in our experiment have different indirect
preferences for the level of taxation and these preferences depend upon the distribution of productivities in the economy. Political institutions are the means by which these heterogeneous preferences
are aggregated into a public decision on the tax rate. However, because the tax rate in turn affects
the amount of income that is generated by the private economy, agents’ preferences for redistribution
themselves are endogenous and depend on aggregate labor supply responses to taxes.
The experiment is motivated by three primary considerations. The first was summarized above:
the large empirical literature devoted to studying these questions about the equity-efficiency tradeoff
and in particular the median voter hypothesis that implies greater inequality leads to higher taxes,
has not succeeded in coming to any consensus about any of the important questions raised by the
theoretical political models of redistributive taxation. Our experiment can address these theoretical
issues by providing data from a simple environment where preferences, technology, and the political
process are tightly controlled, leading to sharp theoretical predictions. This enables us to measure
directly the labor supply effects, and by exogenously controlling the level of inequality, we can address
the causal question of how the degree of inequality in the economy affects the level of redistributive
taxation.
The second consideration concerns the role of the specific mechanism that implements democratic
outcomes. One of the shortcomings of the classic political economy models of income taxation is that
they are completely silent about the mechanics of the political process by which a tax rate is chosen.
The models simply assume that the tax rate preferred by the median voter will emerge, as if by
an invisible political hand. However more recent work in theoretical political economy and game
theory clearly show that the institutional details of a democratic system cannot be ignored, as small
differences in the game form can lead to substantially different outcomes, and that those outcomes do

not necessarily correspond to the ideal point of the median voter. With this in mind, our experimental
design compares the tax rates that emerge under two different majoritarian political processes: direct
democracy and representative democracy. In the direct democracy mechanism, the median voter’s
preferred policy is elicited directly4 , while in the representative democracy system voters choose in an
election between two office-motivated candidates who compete by choosing tax rates as their platforms.
The third consideration is the question of direct preferences for redistribution. The standard
political economy models approach is to characterize indirect preferences for redistribution based on
the assumption that voters are completely selfish and only care about their own after tax income
and their own labor leisure tradeoff. There is a substantial empirical literature on direct preferences
for redistribution, largely addressing questions of cross-cultural differences in preferences for equality,
tolerance of inequality, or interdependent preferences (see Alesina and Giuliano (2011)). There is
also abundant evidence from laboratory experiments suggesting a potentially important role of direct
preferences over redistribution, or social preferences, in economic decision making where inequality is
a key aspect of the final allocations.5 Redistributive taxation is an almost ideal environment where
social preferences can strongly influence behavior and outcomes.
To address this, we characterize the equilibrium effects of social preferences on labor supply and
indirect preferences over tax rates, for two different models of social preferences: altruism and inequality aversion. Altruism leads to systematically higher labor supply for any tax rate, and reduces the
ideal tax rate for all voters, regardless of their productivity. Inequality aversion leads to systematically higher labor supply for high income workers and systematically lower labor supply for low income
workers. Under standard conditions on the level of inequality and the parameters of the Fehr-Schmidt
model, inequality aversion increases the ideal tax rate of the median voter. Hence, this characterization provides plausible and testable alternative hypotheses to the standard theoretical hypotheses
that are derived under the assumption that individuals are selfish.
We have several main results. The first set of results address qualitative hypotheses based on the
first two considerations above, all of which hold regardless of the assumptions about social preferences.
First, higher inequality leads to significantly more income redistribution through higher taxation.
Second, we observe strong labor supply effects. Higher tax rates lead to lower aggregate labor supply
and lower total income, so there is the predicted equity-efficiency tradeoff. Third, the equilibrium
tax rates are largely determined by the voting behavior of the median productivity worker, which is
consistent with the median voter hypothesis. Observation of choice behavior of voters in each political
mechanism (direct and representative democracy) allows us to back out estimates of the revealed
ideal points of different voter types. Our fourth result confirms the monotonic relationship between
ideal tax rates of agents and productivities. As predicted, these revealed ideal points are ordered by
productivity, with less productive (low wage) individuals preferring higher taxes. Fifth, the above
results are robust to the political mechanism: we observe very similar behavior and outcomes under
direct democracy and representative democracy.
A second set of results addresses specific quantitative hypotheses about labor supply decisions,
revealed preferences over tax rates, and equilibrium tax rates. As explained above, these quantitative
predictions strongly depend on social preferences. First, we find that the average observed tax rates are
very close to the predicted tax rates under the standard model without social preferences. Second, we
observe that labor supply decisions are very close to what is predicted by the standard model, with one
important exception: when inequality is very high, the very rich individuals tend to undersupply labor.
However, this deviation from the standard model cannot be accounted for by the social preference
model that predict exactly the opposite effect: rich workers should supply more than what is predicted
by the standard model if they are altruistic or inequality averse. The effect of social preferences on

voting behavior is difficult to assess in the data using simple descriptive statistics. Therefore we
estimate the parameters of the altruism and inequality aversion models, using the data on voting
decisions. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the social preference parameters are equal to zero,
and conclude that social preferences do not play an important role in either labor supply responses to
taxes, or preferences over redistribution. While we hesitate to extrapolate these findings to the much
more complex environments of voting over taxes in mass economies and electorates, the results in our
small carefully-controlled environment are quite sharp.
We see experiments as a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of the political economy
of redistribution and taxation. Indeed, these controlled laboratory experiments provide a clean test
of the theoretical models in very simple environments, while preserving key incentives and tradeoffs
that people face outside of the laboratory. Hence, data created from a carefully controlled setting
that can be used toward the development of better models. Further, our paper can be seen as one of
the first attempts to study the interaction between labor market and political behavior, while keeping
all the remaining details (political institution and distribution of productivities) constant and varying
one parameter at a time. For these purposes, experiments have a significant advantage over empirical
research using historical time-series or cross-sectional data.
The paper is structured as follows. In the remainder of this section, we discuss some related
experimental literature. Section 2 presents the theoretical model where we characterize the equilibrium
under three alternative assumptions about social preferences: purely selfish preferences, altruistic
preferences, and inequality averse preferences. These serve as the basis for hypotheses about the
results of our experiment. Section 3 discusses the experimental design and procedures. The results
are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 offers some brief conclusions.

1.1

Related Literature

There is an extensive experimental literature in economics aimed at measuring preferences for redistribution. Some papers concentrate entirely on examination of two motives - self-interest versus
fairness - and abstract away from efficiency concerns.6 Other more recent studies (e.g., Andreoni and
Miller (2002), Fisman et al. (2007)) investigate whether and how efficiency affects participants’ social
preferences by exogenously allowing the size of the total pie to vary as a function of the shares. Bolton
and Ockenfels (2006) conduct a series of voting games, in which subjects are confronted with two
distributions of incomes: one that promotes efficiency and a second that promotes equity. Tyran and
Sausgruber (2006) offer evidence that inequality averse social preferences may explain voting behavior
over non-distortionary redistribution, in an experiment where subjects were endowed with one of two
different income levels (there is no labor market) and vote on a fixed amount of redistribution. Hochtl
et al. (2012) report a followup experiment and provide evidence that the ability of inequality aversion
to explain voting behavior on redistribution may depend on the pre-tax distribution of income. In
all the papers described above, the amount of resources to be distributed is fixed exogenously and
participants can only decide how to reallocate this surplus. In our experiments subjects’ labor market
decisions determine the total surplus generated, so both the total size of the pie and the distribution
of income is endogenous and is a function of the tax rate. Moreover, while measuring preferences for
redistribution is not the main focus of our paper, our design allows us to detect the presence of social
preferences through analyzing both labor market decisions of agents as well as their voting patterns.
There are two recent studies that are more closely related to our paper. The first is Durante
et al. (2014), a laboratory experiment to study how preferences for redistribution vary with social
preferences, risk aversion, self-interest and the source of pre-tax inequality. In particular, that paper
focuses on whether preferences for redistribution are affected by: (1) the way the distribution of pre-tax
endowments are determined: by luck, or earned in the sense that they are based on the score obtained
in an unrelated skill task; and (2) whether the person choosing the level of redistribution is affected

by this redistribution process him/herself or is merely a disinterested observer. Among other things,
the authors document that most subjects prefer a more equal distribution of final wealth; however,
this preference for redistribution decreases substantially when the initial distribution of endowments is
determined based on the task performance rather than randomly.7 Similarly to the literature discussed
above, the main goal of the Durante et al. study is to measure subjects’ preferences for redistribution
and how they are affected by various factors. Consistent with this goal, the authors use random
dictator method to elicit subjects’ preferences and abstract away from the details of political process
that determine taxation level as well as strategic behavior of subjects in the political sphere, which is
what we do in our study. Put differently, our focus is on the equilibrium behavior of agents in both
economical and political markets and how this behavior is affected by various political institutions
used to determine taxes in the democratic societies.
A second recent paper is Grosser and Reuben (2013), which reports the results of two laboratory experiments. In the first experiment, subjects first earn their income by trading in a double
auction market and the profits generated in the market are redistributed according to one of several
exogenously fixed rules (including zero redistribution). The goal of this experiment is to see whether
equal-share redistribution effects trading efficiency. In a competitive equilibrium there should be no
such effect, and they observed only small effects, and only when the redistribution rule is essentially
equal sharing, which they attribute to out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The second experiment investigates endogenous redistribution by introducing competition between two candidates who propose the
level of redistribution as in our study. Because the taxes are non-distortionary and the median voter
has low income, the theoretical equilibrium tax rate is 100%, which is close to what is observed.8

Model and Theoretical Predictions

In this section we first lay out the primitives of the model and derive equilibrium under the assumption
that agents are purely selfish. We then extend the analysis to consider two alternative models of social
preferences, altruism and inequality aversion, and characterize the equilibrium in each of these models.

2.1

Model with Selfish Agents

The economy consists of n > 1 agents. Agents operate in a perfectly competitive and frictionless
labor market and also participate in a democratic political process that determines taxes which in
turn affect labor decisions. To simplify exposition, we describe here the setup with the utility function
we implement in the experiments.
We start by discussing the decision problem of an agent in the labor market assuming that the
tax rate is fixed. Then we characterize the majority rule equilibrium tax rate, by deriving the induced
preferences of voters, assuming rational expectations about how aggregate labor supply responds to
changes in the income tax rate.
The Labor Market. Agent i is endowed with productivity wi . Individuals are identical in all
other respects. The difference in choice of labor and consumption arise solely because of the differences
in productivity. An agent with productivity wi who supplies xi units of labor earns pre-tax income
yi = wi xi and bears an effort cost of 21 x2i which represents the tradeoff between labor and leisure.
Income and costs are measured in units of consumption. In addition, each agent pays a fraction t of
7

In our experiment, one’s rank on the income scale is determined entirely by luck and there is no social mobility. So
their finding, together with similar findings from survey research on preferences for redistribution (Alesina and Giuliano
(2011)) suggest the likelihood of a significant role of social preferences in our experiment.
8
The timing of voting is also different from our study. Voting over tax rates occurs after subjects make their market
decision. They also include a treatment where voters can offer non-binding bribes to the candidates, with no significant
effect.

earned income in taxes. Tax revenues are redistributed in equal shares.9 Thus the payoff Ui of agent
i consists of three parts: after-tax disposable income, cost of labor, and an equal share of collected
taxes, where the latter depends on the entire profile of productivities, w = (w1 , ..., wn ) and labor
supply decisions x = (x1 , ..., xn ) :

Given the tax rate t, agent i chooses labor supply xi that maximizes (1) above, taking x−i as given.
The utility function is concave, and the unique optimal labor supply for individual i is characterized
by the first order condition:

Thus, all productive agents (i.e., wi > 0) have positive labor supply for all tax rates, t ∈ [0, 1].
Labor supply is declining in the tax rate and is proportional to a worker’s productivity. Hence, pre-tax
income is proportional to the square of productivity.
The Political Process. Tax rates are determined by a political process. There are many possible
voting procedures, and each may produce a different outcome. Here we focus on majoritarian political
institutions, derive the indirect preferences of agents over tax rates, and characterize the majority rule
equilibrium.
The equilibrium payoff of agent i when the tax rate t is implemented and all other agents follow
the behavior prescribed by the equilibrium in the labor market is:

Our first result, Proposition 1, characterizes preferences of agents over tax rates and derives the
tax rate that will emerge in equilibrium.10
PROPOSITION 1:
Agents’ preferences over tax rates satisfy the following properties:11
1. Single-peakedness: for any wi , there exists t∗i ∈ [0, 1] such that
Ui∗ (wi , t) < Ui∗ (wi , t0 ) for all t < t0 ≤ t∗i
Ui∗ (wi , t) < Ui∗ (wi , t0 ) for all t∗i ≥ t0 > t
2. Ideal points are ordered by productivity:

according to the function V (y) = y, which corresponds to the last term of equation (1).
10
We refer the reader to Appendix A for the proofs of all results.
11
These properties are central in the theoretical literature that studies the political economy of redistributive taxation.
Romer (1975) assumes that agents have Cobb-Douglas preferences over consumption and leisure and derives conditions
under which the preferences of agents are single-peaked in the tax rate. Roberts (1977) derives a more general condition
that guarantees that ideal points are inversely ordered by income. Meltzer and Richard (1981) assume the regularity
condition of Roberts (1977).

The intuition for this characterization is straightforward. Agents with lower productivity prefer
higher taxes, because they enjoy substantial redistributive benefits which for the most part come from
the tax payments of the higher productivity, and hence higher income, agents. In contrast, agents with
higher productivity prefer lower taxes (or no taxes at all), because they end up subsidizing the large
portion of the tax revenues from which they receive back only a small part in benefits. Specifically,
voters with below average income prefer positive tax rates, while voters with above average income
prefer zero tax rates.
Single-peakedness and monotonicity of ideal tax rates with respect to productivities, combined
with the majority rule, imply that the agent with the median productivity (median voter) is decisive.
Put differently, the tax rate specified in equation (4), which is the tax rate most preferred by the
median voter, is the unique tax rate that is majority preferred to any other tax rate, and is therefore
a Condorcet winner. This result echoes the median voter theorem from the spatial model of electoral
competition.

maximized when t = 0 since taxes are distortionary.
A natural next question that arises in this setup is: How do tax rates compare across economies
that differ in the distribution of productivity levels of its agents? The following corollary to Proposition
1 provides an answer to this question.
Corollary. Consider two economies with n individuals, which differ only in the profile of proA = w B . Then,
ductivities: wA in economy A and wB in economy B, and suppose that wm

t∗A > t∗B = 0 if and only if n1 Z A > wm

t∗A > t∗B > 0 if and only if n1 Z A > n1 Z B > wm

The corollary can be interpreted in terms of inequality in productivities as measured approximately by the variance of worker productivities. To see this, notice that in the special case where the
median productivity equals the mean productivity, n1 Z is approximately equal to the variance of wi ,
with the approximation being arbitrarily close for large n. In this case, an increase in the variance
that leaves the mean unchanged will lead to a higher equilibrium tax rate. The tax rate chosen by
the median voter will be higher in the economy in which the productivity levels are more unequal as
captured by this variance-related measure, n1 Z. Also, if the distribution of productivities in economy
A is more skewed than the one in economy B then n1 Z A > n1 Z B and we would expect (weakly) higher
taxes in economy A than in economy B. The intuition for this result comes from the fact that tax
revenues are rebated back to all agents in equal shares. When higher productivity agents become more
productive, they supply more labor and, thus, contribute more to the total tax revenues. Therefore,
the median voter would prefer higher taxes and more redistribution since an increase in the tax rebate
associated with an increase in tax rates outweighs the decrease in after-tax disposable income.

2.2

Social Preferences

This model is a natural one for considering the effects of other-regarding preferences. Indeed, in this
framework social preferences of almost any kind will affect both labor supply decisions of agents as
well as their indirect preferences over tax rates. In this section we extend our theoretical analysis to
characterize how labor supply and equilibrium taxes are affected by social preferences. This extension
7

is also important for generating alternative hypotheses about the behavior in our experiment. In
particular, findings from many prior experimental studies, such as dictator games, public goods games,
and ultimatum games suggest that social preferences may play a key role. If this is indeed the case
in our environment, then theoretical predictions derived in the previous section are not the relevant
ones. The analysis in this section provides hypotheses about the economic and political behavior that
are relevant alternative hypotheses to those implied by the standard homo-economicus model. We
explore in depth two commonly used social preferences models: altruism and inequality aversion.12
Preferences for altruism. Denote by UiA (w, x, t) the altruistic utility function of agent i, where:
UiA (w, x, t) = Ui (wi , xi , t) + A

1 X
Uj (wj , xj , t)
n−1
j6=i

where parameter A ≥ 0 measures i’s altruism, i.e., the weight i puts on the average payoff of others
in the society, and for each i, Ui (wi , xi , t) is defined as before by equation (1). The standard model
without social preferences is nested in our altruism model, and corresponds to A = 0.

Fehr-Schmidt Preferences. Order agents according to their productivity from the lowest i = 1
to the highest i = n. Denote by UiF S (w, x, t) the Fehr-Schmidt utility function of agent i, where

where the second term measures utility loss from disadvantageous inequality in payoffs and the third
term measures utility loss from advantageous inequality in payoffs. The standard assumption in the
literature is that 0 ≤ β ≤ α ≤ 1, i.e. individuals experience greater utility loss from inequality when
their payoff is below average than when their payoff is above average. The standard model without
social preferences is nested in the inequality aversion model and corresponds to α = β = 0.

2.2.1

Labor supply effects of social preferences.

In this subsection, we characterize the effects of altruism and inequality aversion on individual labor
supply decisions, for any given tax rate. Proposition 2 below establishes two results. First, altruism
leads to higher labor supply compared to the selfish model, for all values of A and for all productivity
levels. Second, inequality aversion leads to higher individual labor supply if and only if an individual’s
productivity rank is sufficiently high. Thus, for any tax rate, relatively high productivity inequality
averse individuals will supply more labor than a selfish individual, while relatively low productivity
workers will supply less labor.
Proposition 2:

In order to avoid some special sub-cases, we assume throughout the analysis in this section that individual productivities are distinct. This restriction is consistent with the experimental parameters and shortens the proofs for inequality
averse preferences by avoiding some special cases. The results are easily extended.

if i <

There are several implications of this proposition. First, as in the case of selfish preferences, the
optimal labor supply of either altruistic or inequality averse individuals does not depend on the labor
supply choices of other individuals because of the additively separable specification of payoffs, even
though agents care about inequality. Second, labor supply and income remain ordered by productivity,
for any tax rate, in both social preference models.
Third, there are some clear comparative statics properties about how labor supply changes as
social preferences become more intense. If social preferences are altruistic, then greater altruism leads
unambiguously to greater labor supply, and hence redistributive taxes are less distortionary in a world
of altruistic individuals. The intuition is clear. At the selfish level of labor supply the marginal private
benefit from supplying the next unit is equal to the marginal cost, but the marginal private benefit to
the other individuals of supplying that extra unit is positive.
The comparative statics for the inequality aversion model are more complicated because it is a
two-parameter model, but we can still say quite a bit. An increase in the envy parameter, α, increases
µi , and hence decreases labor supply. The opposite is true for the guilt parameter, β. An increase in
β, decreases µi , and hence decreases labor supply. Simultaneously increasing α and β by a constant
will reduce output by all individuals below the median and will increase output by all voters above
the median. A related property of the inequality aversion model is that in the special case where
α = β > 0 the critical rank below which inequality averse individuals supply less labor and above
which inequality averse individuals supply more labor is precisely equal to the median productivity
level. More generally, µm = 2+α−β
> 1 if and only if α > β, and therefore the median individual
2
with inequality averse preferences will never supply more labor than a selfish individual, under the
standard assumption that α ≥ β. Furthermore, for any α and β, for large societies, the critical rank is
α
α+β , which corresponds to an individual above the median productivity level as long as α ≥ β. One
can also show that a proportionate increase in inequality aversion ((1 + )α, (1 + )β) increases total
income if the median is less than the mean.

2.2.2

Equilibrium tax effects of social preferences.

Altruism and inequality aversion affect equilibrium taxes in opposite ways. A society of altruists
prefers lower taxes, as everyone is concerned, at least to some degree with efficiency, which declines
9

when taxes increase. Thus, a small increase in altruism will result in a lower ideal tax rate for each
individual (unless the individual’s ideal tax rate was already equal to 0). With inequality aversion,
because µm > 1, at the margin the median voter is more concerned about reducing the payoff of
higher productivity workers than increasing the payoff of lower productivity workers, even if this
means lowering her own payoff. There are some minor equilibrium effects that can go the other way,
but we are able to show in the proposition below that under some fairly weak conditions the other
effects are small enough for the main intuition to hold.
2 < 1 Z.
Proposition 3. Assume n > 3 and wm

1. If individuals are altruistic and 0 < A ≤ 1, then the ideal tax rate of the median productivity
individual is strictly lower than that individual’s ideal tax rate would be if A = 0, i.e.
∗

m < tm

2. If individuals have inequality averse preferences such that 0 < β ≤ α ≤ ᾱ(β, n), then the ideal
tax rate of the median productivity individual is strictly higher than that individual’s ideal tax
rate would be if α = β = 0, i.e.
tFmS ≥ t∗m
At this point we briefly discuss the assumptions about the social preference parameters. First,
given that the question being addressed is redistribution of income on a society-wide level, the require2 < 1Z
ment that n > 3 does not seem to rule out interesting cases. Second, the assumption that wm
n
is needed in order for positive income taxes to be an equilibrium phenomenon. If the median income
is above the mean income, then there will be no income redistribution. That case is not empirically
relevant. Third, the assumption that 0 < A ≤ 1 in the altruism model is natural since weighting the
per capita payoffs higher than one’s own payoff seems implausible. The assumption that α ≥ β is
standard in the inequality aversion literature, but could be relaxed. The results for labor supply do
not depend on that assumption, but if α < β then the cutoff rank for inequality aversion to have a
positive effect on labor supply will be below the median voter. The result that inequality aversion
leads to higher taxes can fail if α is very large and β is very small because then too few individuals
exhibit a positive labor supply effect from inequality aversion. For example, if β < αn then there is a
positive labor supply effect only on the highest productivity worker. Thus, if α is too large relative
to β, the amount of extra redistribution that occurs is outweighed by the income distortion resulting
from higher taxes. That is why Proposition 3 imposes α ≤ ᾱ(β, n).

Experimental Design

Our design considers two very different competitive democratic institutions for determining the tax
rate. In a world with perfect information and perfect optimization by all agents, both regimes theoretically will produce the same tax rate outcome, which will correspond to the median voter ideal
point. The two institutions we consider are direct democracy and representative democracy.
Direct democracy (DD) was implemented by simply allowing every individual voter an equal say
in the outcome, without introducing candidates or representatives. Under the direct democracy mechanism, each voter proposes a tax rate, and the median proposal is directly implemented. It is well
known (Moulin (1985)) that under this mechanism every voter has a dominant strategy to propose his
or her ideal tax rate. Because it is a dominant strategy, as long as voters have rational expectations
about how the tax rate affects the labor supply decisions of the other voters, this should lead unambiguously to tax rate outcomes corresponding to equation (4), without any additional assumptions
about information or beliefs held by the players in the game.

10

Representative democracy (RD) was implemented as Downsian candidate competition, by introducing two additional players into the game, both of whom are purely office-motivated candidates,
with no private preferences over tax rates. This leads to a three stage game. In the first stage, the
two candidates simultaneously propose (binding) tax rates, which they will impose if they are elected
to represent the voters. In the second stage, voters simultaneously vote for one of the two candidates,
with no abstention. In the third stage, after the representative is elected, the voters make their labor
supply decisions, taking as given the tax rate of the winning candidate. In this regime, if candidates
have rational expectations about how each voter will vote between every pair of proposed tax rates,
and in addition voters have rational expectations about how tax rates affect labor supply decisions,
then the equilibrium is for both candidates to propose the ideal tax rate of the median voter.
According to theory, the median voter’s ideal tax rate is the equilibrium in both regimes. However,
the informational requirements for the equilibrium are more difficult to achieve in the RD regime.
Not only must voters have rational expectations about labor supply distortions, but in addition the
candidates must also have rational expectations about how voters choose between pairs of tax rates.
In contrast, in the first stage of the DD regime, each voter has a dominant strategy to propose his or
her ideal tax rate, regardless of their beliefs about the proposal strategies of the other voters. Thus,
a priori, the RD regime, which more closely resembles a democratic process we observe, provides a
tougher test for the theory.
Moreover, in order to test whether a more unequal distribution of income leads to greater income
redistribution via higher equilibrium tax rates (which is one of the main predictions of the theoretical papers on equilibrium tax rates) we also have two distributional treatments, which we call Low
inequality and High inequality. The productivity of the median voter is the same in both treatments
Low = w High ), but the relevant inequality measure is higher in High than Low (Z Low < Z High ). Both
(wm
m
have interior equilibrium tax rates, so that 0 < t∗Low < t∗High < 1.
Table 1 specifies the values used in each treatment and lists the ideal tax rates for all agents,
assuming selfish preferences. The only difference between parameters in the High and Low inequality
treatments is the productivity of the most productive agent. We next describe in more detail the
procedures used in each experiment.

Experimental Procedures

All the experiments were conducted at the CASSEL (California Social Science Experimental Laboratory) using students from the University of California, Los Angeles. Subjects were recruited from a
database of volunteer subjects.13 Eleven sessions were run, using a total of 228 subjects. No subject
participated in more than one session. We used a between subjects design, so each subject participated
in only one treatment. Table 2 summarizes the sessions.
The experimental currency was called tokens. Each token a subject earned was converted to
dollars at an exchange rate of $1 = 200 tokens.14 Total earnings for a subject was the sum of earnings
across all periods in the session, plus a $10 show up fee. Average earnings, including the show up fee,
were approximately $32 with a standard deviation of $7.8. Sessions lasted approximately two hours
on average.

Low Inequality

2 sessions (49 subjects; 7 groups)

Upon arrival to the laboratory, subjects were divided into groups of five or seven agents: five
in the DD sessions and seven in the RD sessions. Five subjects in each group performed the role of
agents and two additional subjects in the RD sessions performed the role of the candidates. Each
agent in a group was assigned one of the five productivities (see Table 1). Productivity assignments
and the group assignments were fixed for the whole duration of the session. At the very beginning of
the session each agent was told their own productivity, but also told the productivity of each of the
other four agents.
There were two parts in each session. In the first part, which lasted for 10 periods, subjects
gained experience with the labor market. In the second part of the experiment, which also lasted
for 10 periods, depending on the session subjects participated in either the DD or the RD game.
Instructions for the second part of the session were given to the participants only after they finished
the first part.15 We will now describe the specific experimental procedures that were common to all
the sessions and then describe how different political regimes were implemented.
In the first part of a session, at the beginning of each period agents were informed of the tax rate
for that period. Then they chose how much labor to supply without knowing what other subjects in
their group chose.16 Labor supply decisions were allowed to be any number between 0 and 25 with up
to two decimal places.17 After all five agents had made their choice, subjects received feedback that
specified the labor supply of each agent in their group, and an agent’s own payoff was displayed on
the screen, broken down into three parts: after-tax income, the quadratic cost of labor, and their tax
rebate (equal share of collected taxes). After the period was over, the group moved on to the next
13
The software for the experiment was developed from the open source Multistage package, available for download at
http://software.ssel.caltech.edu/.
14
The exchange rate was higher ($1 = 100 tokens) for the Low inequality treatment because the potential theoretical
earnings were lower.
15
Appendix B contains the instructions for the DD High inequality treatment.
16
The terminology in the experiment avoided reference to work, effort, productivity or other terms associated with
labor markets. The individual labor supply decision was called the “investment level” and productivities/wages were
called “values”. Pre-tax labor income was called “investment earnings”.
17
Recall that the optimal choice of labor given the tax rate is xi (wi , t) = (1 − n−1
t) · wi = (1 − 0.8t) · wi . Thus, for
n
all agents and for all tax rates, the theoretically optimal choice of labor is away from the boundaries (strictly below 25
and strictly above 0), except for the agent with highest productivity in High inequality treatment (wi = 35). Agent with
wi = 35 should choose xi (35, t) = 25 for any tax rate below 0.375. In equilibrium, the upper bound of 25 is not binding
for either parameter set.

period which was identical to the previous one except for the tax rate imposed at the beginning of the
period. In this training part of the session, subjects went through different possible tax rates, in the
following order: 0.50, 0.15, 0.70, 0.62, 0.35, 0.05, 0.27, 0.75, 0.90, 0.20.
To help subjects calculate hypothetical earnings from different labor supply choices, they were
provided with a built-in calculator that appeared on their monitors. To use the calculator, subjects
had to enter two numbers: a labor supply decision and a guess for the total taxes collected from
the other members in their group. Then, the calculator computed the payoff of the subject in this
hypothetical scenario taking into account the current tax rate in this training period and the wage
assigned to the subject.
Experimental protocol specific for Direct Democracy. In the second part of the DD
sessions, at the beginning of each period each agent was asked to submit a proposal for the tax rate.
The median proposal (third lowest tax rate) was announced to all subjects and implemented in that
period. After the tax rate was determined, subjects chose their labor supply as in the first training
part. Again, after the tax rate was determined, subjects could use the on-screen calculator to evaluate
different hypothetical scenarios before they submitted their labor supply decision. This two-stage
process was repeated 10 times (10 periods).
Experimental protocol specific for Representative Democracy. The first (training) 10
periods of the RD sessions were the same as the ones in the DD sessions except that the two subjects
in the role of candidates were also given a task. In order to focus the candidates’ attention during
these periods, in each period each candidate was randomly assigned one of the agents, was told the
agent’s productivity and the tax rate for that period, and then was asked to guess the labor supply of
that agent. In each of the first ten periods, a candidate earned 100 tokens for guessing correctly and
0 tokens for guessing incorrectly, where the correct guess was defined as within 2 points of the actual
labor supply decision of that agent in that period. At the end of each period, the candidates observed
all the labor choices of all five agents in their group.
Each of the 10 periods of the second part of the RD sessions had three stages. In the first stage,
the two candidates simultaneously submitted tax rate proposals. In the second stage, all agents in a
group observed the two candidates’ tax rate proposals and voted for one of the candidates, with no
abstention. The tax rate proposal submitted by the candidate who received a majority of three or
more votes was implemented for that period. In the third stage, the process was the same as in the
DD sessions: agents observed the tax rate, chose how much to work and then got feedback for that
period. The only source of earnings for the candidates in the last 10 periods was winning elections: the
winning candidate in a period earned 200 tokens and the loser earned 0 tokens. This payoff structure
aimed to incentivize candidates to propose the ideal tax rate of the median voter, since, in theory, it
defeats any other proposed tax rate if all agents are choosing their labor supply decisions optimally.
As in the DD regime, once the tax rate for the period was determined, agents could use the built-in
calculator to evaluate hypothetical scenarios before submitting the final labor decision.18

18

Additional RD sessions were also conducted with an alternative protocol that was problematic because it eliminated
the learning phase and limited comparability with the DD sessions. Those sessions exhibited slower convergence to the
theoretically predicted tax rates, but were otherwise similar.

Results

We organize the results of the experiment in four sections following the questions posed in the introduction. In Section 4.1 we test the main predictions of the theoretical model presented in Section
2 combining the data from both political regimes. In particular, in this section we investigate the
median voter hypothesis, the effect of inequality on redistribution, aggregate labor market behavior,
and the equity-efficiency tradeoff. The second set of results, presented in Section 4.2, focuses on the
effects of political institutions on the behavior of agents in both economic and political domains. We
start that section by comparing taxes that each political regime implements. We then back out revealed ideal tax rates for agents with different productivities and test whether there is a monotonic
relationship between revealed tax rates and productivities. Finally, we compare whether the two political institutions have an indirect effect on the labor market behavior. In the third set of results,
presented in Section 4.3, we investigate whether our data suggest the presence of social preferences
for redistribution both in the labor market and in the political domain. In the fourth section, we
investigate the linkage between variation in implemented tax rates across groups and differences in
labor supply across groups.

4.1

Main theoretical predictions

In this section we analyze the main predictions of the theory presented in Section 2. To do that we
pool together the data from both political regimes.

4.1.1

Implemented Taxes

The theoretical results of Section 2 imply the hypothesis that greater inequality leads to higher taxes.
Hence, we should observe higher tax rates in our High inequality treatment than in our Low inequality
treatment. The data strongly support this hypothesis. Table 3 presents summary statistics of implemented taxes in each inequality treatment focusing on the last 10 periods (Part II) of the experiment.
Figure 1 shows the evolution of the average implemented tax for the same part of the game.

Note. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, clustered by group.

As Table 3 shows, taxes are higher in the High Inequality treatment than in the Low Inequality
treatment, and the effect is highly significant. This result is also confirmed statistically by regressing
the implemented tax rates on a dummy variable for the High inequality treatment. The estimated
coefficient is positive and statistically significant: β = 0.24 (p < 0.01).19
Figure 2 presents the CDF of the implemented tax rates in each inequality treatment. A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the null hypothesis that taxes implemented in the High inequality
treatment come from the same distribution as the ones implemented in the Low inequality treatment
(p < 0.01).20
19
In fact, as Figure 1 clearly shows, in every single period tax rates are higher in the High inequality treatment than
in the Low Inequality treatment. Using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test performed period-by-period, the taxes in the High
Inequality treatment are significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the Low Inequality treatment in 9 out of 10 periods.
20
The figures also show that, while average implemented tax rates converge to the theoretically predicted ones, there is
heterogeneity on the group-level data. We return to the analysis of this heterogeneity in Section 4.4 where we investigate

14

Figure 1: Implemented Taxes, dynamics

Figure 2: CDF of Implemented Tax Rates

Result 1a: Tax rates are significantly higher when inequality is high.
The second prediction of the theory is the median voter hypothesis, that for both inequality treatments the ideal tax rate of the median productivity agent will be implemented. Our data also provide
support for this hypothesis. As evident from Figure 1, on average, in both inequality treatments taxes
converge to the ones predicted by the theory almost exactly. This is confirmed statistically for each
inequality treatment separately, based on the means and standard errors reported in Table 3, and also
by a Wilcoxon Rank-sum median test p > 0.05.

Labor Supply

Table 4 reports the mean difference between actual labor choices of agents and the predicted ones,
broken down by the productivity levels and treatments. The data show that behavior of agents in the
labor market is close to that predicted by theory. However, in general agents with low productivity
somewhat oversupply labor, while agents with high productivity somewhat undersupply it. This
undersupply of labor is especially pronounced for agents with the highest productivity of 35 in the
High Inequality treatments in both regimes: these agents on average supplied labor by about 3 units
too low.

Both the undersupply by high wage workers and the oversupply by low wage workers contradict
some of the main implications of the social preference models for our environment. Indeed, as we have
shown in Section 2, the model of inequality aversion by Fehr-Schmidt predicts that high wage workers
will oversupply labor and low wage workers will undersupply labor relative to the standard case.
Alternatively, the model of agents with altruistic preferences predicts that all agents will oversupply
labor relative to the standard case. While one might expect to observe behavior consistent with otherregarding preferences in our setup (indeed, subjects are endowed with very different productivities
and can reduce this inequality by adjusting their labor supply), the first look at the data suggests
that this is not the case. We return to this observation in Section 4.3 with a more rigorous statistical
estimation of the parameters altruism and inequality aversion implied by labor supply data.
To estimate the labor supply functions of the agents, we define the normalized labor supply
x∗ (w ,t)
function, L(t), as: L(t) ≡ i wii = 1 − n−1
n t. Table 13 reports the Tobit estimates obtained by
regressing observed normalized labor supply ( wxii ) on a constant and the tax rate. We do this separately
for each productivity level. Because we have 40 groups and 20 observations per group, this gives us 800
observations for each of the four lower productivity levels is (which are the same in both High and Low
inequality treatments) and 400 observations for the high productivity voters (which are different in
the High and Low inequality treatments). For the highest productivity worker in the High inequality
treatment (wi = 35), the constraint xi ≤ 25 is binding if the tax rate is sufficiently low (t ≤ 0.375). So
we run separate regressions for t ≤ 0.375 and t > 0.375 for this one class of worker-voters. Thus, the
table reports the estimates of the constant term α and the coefficient on the tax rate β for a total of
seven different regressions. According to the theoretical normalized labor supply equation derived for
selfish agents, the estimates for the first six (unconstrained) regressions are predicted to be α = 1 and
β = − n−1
n = −0.8. For the constrained regression reported in the last row, the predicted estimates
were α = 0.71 and β = 0.
The results reported in Table 13 are largely consistent with the theory without social preferences.
With only one exception the estimated coefficients are not significantly different from the predicted
values at the 5% level. The one exception is the estimated slope of the response to the tax rate for the
highest productivity worker when constraint xi ≤ 25 is binding. The estimated slope is significantly

the last row of Table 4.
Result 2: Labor supply decisions by agents are approximately optimal and consistent
with the theoretical model with selfish agents.
4.1.3

Welfare

There are two dimensions to consider in the welfare analysis of redistributive taxation: equity (or
related notions of distributive justice) and efficiency. There is a tradeoff between these two dimensions,
and both are jointly determined by the tax rate in the political sector and the labor supply decisions
made in the economic sector. Thus, the welfare analysis must consider the combined political economy
effects in the two sectors. The tradeoff is explicitly modeled in the theoretical framework we use: the
more pre-tax income is going to be redistributed, the less labor will be supplied. Assuming that each
worker chooses his labor supply optimally given the tax rate, we can construct an equity-efficiency
frontier, for any particular measure of equity and efficiency. We use one minus the post-tax Gini
coefficient as our measure of equity, and total income as the measure of efficiency.21 Using these
measures, we define the equity-efficiency frontier as the locus of points in this two dimensional space
corresponding to after tax equity-efficiency pairs that would arise from optimal labor supply behavior
as we vary tax rates from 0 to 1. We use this as a benchmark with which to compare the actual
equity-efficiency tradeoff that is observed in the experiment.
Figure 3 displays all the equity-efficiency pairs for all group outcomes in the low inequality and
high inequality treatments, respectively. The solid line in the figures marks the frontier with the upper
left of the frontier corresponding to t = 1 and the lower right of the frontier corresponding to t = 0.22
Table 6 below gives the averages across all the equity-efficiency pairs for the two treatments, with
standard errors in parentheses (clustered by group).
From a slightly different perspective, Figure 4 plots the Laffer curve for each inequality treatment,
with total tax revenues displayed as a function of the tax rate t. The solid line represents the theoretical
Laffer curve, derived under the assumption that all agents supply labor optimally given the tax rate,
while the data observed in the experiments are marked as the circles. This graph is essentially a
different projection of the three-dimensional picture that summarizes the relation between tax rates,
efficiency and equality in the economy.
21

There are alternative measures as well, such as the variance of the income distribution to measure inequality or
netting out the effort costs of labor in the measure of efficiency. These alternative measures lead to similar conclusions.
22
The frontier as we have defined it does not represent the boundary of feasible equity-efficiency pairs. In principle,
workers are free to supply 25 units of labor for any tax rate, but doing so is not consistent with equilibrium in our labor
market.

17

Figure 3: Equity-Efficiency Frontier

Figure 4: Laffer Curves

Several observations can be made about the data displayed in these figures. First, Figure 3
shows that, consistent with the theoretical equity-efficiency tradeoff, higher tax rates lead to lower
aggregate labor supply and lower total income in both inequality treatments. Second, deviations from
the theoretical frontiers in Low inequality treatment are minimal, balanced between points above and
below the frontiers and are not correlated with the tax rate (as seen from the right panels of Figures
3 and 4). The picture is different in the High inequality treatment, in which deviations from the
efficiency-equity frontier and from the theoretically predicted Laffer curve are much more pronounced,
in a negative direction. Most of these deviations are on the side of undersupply of labor for a given tax
rate (left panel of Figure 4), since most of the data points are below the predicted tax revenues. The
undersupply of aggregate labor in the high inequality treatment is driven mainly by the undersupply
of labor by the highest productivity agent (that with productivity wi = 35), reported in Table 4.
However, there is no clear pattern of these deviations with respect to different tax rates: undersupply
of aggregate labor is observed for both high and low tax rates.
Result 3a: Higher tax rates lead to lower total income irrespectively of the inequality
level, as predicted by the efficiency-equity tradeoff.
Result 3b: In the Low inequality treatment, the data closely track the efficiencyequity frontier and theoretical Laffer curve, while in the High inequality treatment the
deviations from these frontiers are sizable and negative.

Effects of Political Institutions

In this section we compare how the two political regimes, direct democracy (DD) and representative
democracy (RD), affect the implemented tax rates, voting behavior, and labor supply.
4.2.1

Implemented Taxes

Table 7 summarizes the implemented tax rates in each political regime in each inequality treatment.
The results of a regression analysis confirm that in each political regime, higher inequality leads to
significantly higher level of redistribution. Specifically, for each political regime separately, we regress
implemented taxes on a dummy variable for the High inequality treatment. Estimated coefficients are
positive and highly significant (p < 0.01): β = 0.21 for DD regime and β = 0.27 for RD regime.
Moreover, there is no significant difference between the average or median implemented taxes
in the DD and RD regimes, for each inequality treatment. To reach this conclusion we regress implemented taxes on a dummy variable for the RD regime, for each inequality treatment separately,
clustering observations by group. The estimated coefficient is not statistically different from zero for
either inequality treatment (p > 0.05).23 This is further confirmed by a Wilcoxon Rank-sum test that
does not reject the hypothesis that median implemented taxes are equal in the DD and RD regimes,
in both High and Low inequality treatments (p > 0.05).
Result 4: In both political regimes, higher inequality leads to higher taxation as
predicted by the theory. The mean and median implemented tax rates are the same in
the two regimes, for both inequality treatments.

The small difference in the average implemented tax rates in DD and RD regimes in the High inequality treatment
(0.474 vs. 0.536) is entirely due to differences in the first few rounds of the game. By the end of the experiment (last
5 rounds) the average implemented tax rate in the High inequality treatment in both the DD and the RD regimes is
exactly equal to 0.53.

4.2.2

Voting Behavior

Besides the predictions about equilibrium tax rates as a function of the distribution of wage rates,
the model also makes more specific predictions about voter behavior in the two institutional regimes.
Specifically, in DD, all voters, regardless of productivity, have a dominant strategy to propose their
most preferred tax rate, assuming all voters supply labor optimally conditional on any tax rate.
Similarly, in RD, voters have a dominant strategy to vote for the candidate who proposed the more
preferred of the two candidates’ tax rates, once again under the assumption that all voters supply
labor optimally. In this section, we investigate voters’ behavior relative to these two benchmarks.
Tax Proposals in DD. Figure 5 displays the median and average proposed tax rates, by productivity type, in the DD-High and DD-Low treatments, pooling across all groups for the last 10 periods,
and compares it with the theoretical peak of the induced voter preferences. In all cases the observed
mean or median proposals match up closely with the theory. In particular, the average proposals by
the median voter, with a productivity of 10 is almost exactly equal to the predicted proposal (0.54 vs.
0.53 in DD-high and 0.27 vs. 0.28 in DD-low). There are a two minor discrepancies that are worth
noting. First, for high productivity voters who are predicted to propose zero tax, on average the proposal is for a tax rate of about 0.10. Second, in DD-high, the mean proposals are not perfectly ordered
by productivity. The second lowest productivity worker has a higher average proposed tax rate than
the lowest productivity voters (0.59 vs. 0.56), but this difference is not statistically significant. We
also note that while the average observed tax proposals match the theoretical ideal tax rates, there is
considerable variance in the proposals (as is evident from the relatively large standard errors).
Figure 5: Proposed Tax Rates, by productivity.

Voting Behavior in RD. Table 8 summarizes voting behavior in each inequality treatment in
the RD regime broken down by productivity level, pooling across all groups for the last 10 periods.
The second column lists the fraction of correct votes: a vote is labeled correct if the candidate the
voter voted for proposed a tax rate that theoretically would yield at least as high a payoff as the
proposed tax rate of the other candidate. The third column indicates the number of correct votes,
with the number of cases where both candidates proposed the same tax rate in parentheses. The
fourth and fifth columns list the number of mistakes separated into two categories: the mistakes in
which participants voted for a higher of the two proposed taxes, in column four, and the mistakes in
which the vote was cast for the lowee of the two proposed taxes, in column five. Table 8 shows that,
for all productivity levels, most votes cast in the RD treatment were ”correct”, with somewhat more
accurate voting behavior observed in the Low than in the High inequality treatment. An interesting
20

observation from these graphs is that incorrect votes in the High inequality treatment tend to be votes
for too high a tax rate.

Figure 6 provides a more complete description of voting behavior in the RD sessions, again broken
down by productivity level. Each panel in the figure displays simultaneously the two proposals that are
offered in each election and the proposal the voter of that productivity voted for. The horizontal axis
represents the tax rate proposed by the candidate the voter voted for, and the vertical axis corresponds
to the tax rate proposed by the other candidate. Each panel also has two crossing line segments. Those
line segments represent pairs of tax proposals that the voter in theoretically indifferent between. One
of the segments, the upward sloping one, obviously is the diagonal. The other, downward sloping line
represent pairs that are equidistant from the voter’s ideal tax rate. The two lines intersect at the
ideal tax rate of the voter. Therefore, correct votes are in north and south quadrants. Incorrect votes
are in the east and west quadrants.24 Most of the incorrect votes lie fairly close to one of the two
indifference-pair line segments.
Finally, we use the classification of votes introduced in Figure 6 to estimate the empirical ideal
tax rates in the RD sessions in two ways. The first method finds, for each productivity, the tax rate
(or the range of the tax rates) that minimizes the number of mistakes, i.e. the number of points in the
east and west quadrants of Figure 6. The second method computes the tax rate that minimizes utility
loss from the voting mistakes, where utility loss is defined as the shortest distance from a point in the
east or west quadrant to the closest indifference line. Table 9 summarizes inferred ideal tax rates in
both political regimes along with the theoretically predicted ones. The main observation that emerges
from this table is clear: except for the small discrepancies in the DD-High treatment, inferred ideal
tax rates of agents are monotonically decreasing in agents’ productivities in both political regimes.
Result 5: In both political regimes and in both inequality treatments, empirical ideal
tax rates are ordered by agent productivities.
24
For high productivity voters whose ideal point is zero tax, the west and south quadrants do not exist, reflecting the
fact that it is always optimal for these voters to vote for the lower tax rate.

4.2.3

Labor Supply

We conclude this section by noting that the labor supply behavior in both political regimes is very
similar. The results of the regression analysis of normalized labor supply performed separately for
each political regime and each inequality treatment produce estimates similar to those given in Table
5 for the pooled regression (see Table 13 in Appendix C).
Result 6: In both political regimes, observed labor supply decisions are consistent
with the predictions of the theory with selfish agents, with the exception of undersupply
of labor by the highest productivity workers when tax rates are very low.

4.3

Estimating Social Preference Models

In this section we address the question of whether our data provide evidence of the presence of otherregarding preferences in the labor market and/or in the political domain. As observed in Section
4.1, we cannot reject the hypothesis that labor supply choices and implemented taxes are statistically

different from the predictions of the theory with selfish agents. However, this does not mean that
voters necessarily have selfish preferences. In order to reach this conclusion, we need to investigate
whether our data might also be compatible with other-regarding preferences, based on the theoretical
results developed in Section 2.
4.3.1

Labor Supply

We start with the labor market and do the following exercise. For each inequality treatment, we
estimate the altruism parameter A ∈ [0, 1) by finding the value of A that minimizes the sum of
squared deviations of the observed labor decisions from the theoretically predicted ones for that value
of A. We use a similar method to estimate the two inequality aversion parameters, (α, β). Table 10
presents the results of this estimation. We also report estimates based on the full dataset, pooling
across the two inequality treatments. The estimates that are not marked with an asterisk are not
significantly different from zero at any reasonable significance level, based on a chi-squared test. The
estimates marked with an asterisk are statistically different from zero (p < 0.05).

Notes. Data pooled across both RD and DD regimes.

This estimation reveals no social preference effects on labor supply in the high inequality treatments. We cannot reject the null that α = β = 0 in all treatments, in both all rounds of the experiment
as well as in the last 10 rounds of the experiment. With respect to altruism, we measure only a very
small positive value of A in the Low Inequality treatment.
23

4.3.2

Proposal Behavior

Social preferences would also affect the preferences of agents over the tax schedules. The data from
the DD regime is perfectly suited for testing it because the median proposal mechanism is specifically
designed to directly elicit each voter’s ideal tax rate. Similar to what we did for the labor supply data,
we estimate the altruism parameter, A, and the inequality aversion parameters, (α, β), by minimizing
the sum of square distances between the observed tax proposals and the optimal tax proposals for
each productivity type, conditional on the parameters. The results are reported in Table 11. Again,
our estimates indicate almost no social preference effects in the observed ideal tax rates, as revealed
in the proposal data. We estimate a small and insignificant altruism coefficient (A = 0.01) in the
low inequality economies, and a very small and insignificant envy parameter (α = 0.01) for the high
inequality treatment. In all other cases the best fitting parameters equal 0.

Result 7: Social preference effects on both labor supply and revealed ideal tax rates
are negligible. There is evidence only of a small amount of altruism based on labor
supply behavior in the DD low treatment, and no evidence of inequality aversion.

4.4

Empirical Equilibrium

The results so far paint a picture of the aggregate data as being close to the theory based on selfish
preferences with respect to (1) the qualitative comparative statics; (2) average and median implemented tax rates; (3) the individual labor supply responses to tax rates (except for the wi = 35
workers); (4) the aggregate labor supply effect of taxes; and (5) voting behavior. However there is
some variance across groups in the data, as one can infer from Figures 2 and 3. In this section we
take a closer look at this variation, and in particular explore the possibility that deviations from the
equilibrium tax rates may be driven by variation across groups with respect to expectations about
labor supply responses to taxes.
Theoretically, deviations from equilibrium labor supply responses to tax rates, if correctly anticipated by voters, will lead to distortions in the political equilibrium tax rates. That is, the equilibrium
tax rates in High and Low Inequality treatments derived in Section 2 were based on the assumption
that all agents make optimal labor decisions at all tax rates, and all voters correctly anticipate this.
However, to the extent that we find actual aggregate labor supply functions to be different from the
theoretical ones, if these deviations vary systematically across groups, then one might expect rational
candidates to propose different tax rates in the RD regime and agents to offer different tax proposals
in the DD regime. Therefore, in this section we will connect the analysis of the labor and political
markets and ask whether the variation in the labor supply across different groups is linked in this way
to the variation in the implemented tax rates. We refer to tax rates that constitute an equilibrium
relative to the empirical labor supply functions as an empirical equilibrium.
To do this, we construct three alternative models of “empirical equilibrium” (EE) tax rates that
differ according to the method used to estimate the labor supply functions in a group. That is, we
estimate empirical labor supply functions of each agent in each group, and then compute the empirical
equilibrium tax rate for that group based on the estimated labor supply functions. The challenge is

24

to obtain good estimates of the labor supply functions. To deal with this issue, rather than choosing
one particular method to estimate labor supply, we apply three different alternative models to do this
estimation. The first, EE1, uses only the data from the first 10 periods to estimate the labor supply
functions of each group member, and uses this estimate to compute an adjusted median voter’s ideal
tax rate as the basis for the empirical equilibrium tax rate. The second, EE2, is similar, but uses the
labor supply data from all 20 periods. The third model, EE3, takes a different approach. For each
group EE3 is based only on the earnings of the median productivity worker across the ten trial tax
rates in the first 10 periods; the EE3 tax rate is the one of these for which that agent experienced the
highest earnings.
Table 12 shows the results of regressing predicted against observed tax rates, using all 400 observations from the 40 groups in the experiment. The observed tax rate in each group equals the
median of that group’s ten implemented taxes in periods 11-20. The predicted tax rate is calculated
for each of the models EE1, EE2 and EE3 described above, as well as for the theoretical model based
on individually optimal labor supply, derived in Section 2.

The first model based on the theoretical labor supply functions nails the coefficients almost
exactly. The theoretical equilibrium model has an intercept equal to 0.00 and a slope equal to 0.94,
and we cannot reject the hypothesis that they equal 0 and 1, respectively. Based on the coefficient
estimates, all three EE models reject that hypothesis. In fact, for EE1 and EE2, one cannot even
reject the hypothesis that the slope equals 0. In terms of model fit, the R2 is slightly higher for the
three EE models than the theoretical equilibrium model, but this does not take into account that we
are implicitly burning some degrees of freedom by estimating the labor supply curves for each group
and then feeding those estimates into each of the EE models.

Conclusion

This article presents the results from an experiment to explore the median voter theory of equilibrium
income tax rates that produce distortions in labor supply. The experiment is novel in a number of
ways, including combining a labor market with a political market, where preferences in the political
market are endogenous and are determined by expectations about labor supply responses to taxes. The
central focus was on four main questions. Does greater inequality ex ante lead to higher tax rates and
more income redistribution? Are the implemented tax rates driven by the induced preferences of the
median income voter? Do the implemented tax rates depend on the institutional rules governing the
collective choice procedure? Do social preferences have a significant impact on labor supply responses
to tax rates or to indirect voter preferences over tax rates?
The answer to the first question is unambiguously yes. Higher ex ante inequality in terms of worker
wage rates leads to higher tax rates. The effect is significant and large in magnitude. The answer to
25

the second question is related to the first: the implemented tax rates in both inequality treatments
are almost exactly equal to the theoretical ideal tax rate of the median wage worker. The answer to
the third question is negative. We do not observe any significant differences in labor supply or average
implemented tax rates between the direct democracy institution and a representative democracy where
tax rates are determined by candidate competition. While there are many other possible democratic
collective choice procedures that one could examine, this third finding is at least suggestive of a
robustness with respect to the finer details of majoritarian democratic choice procedures. The answer
to the fourth question is also negative. We do not observe significant deviations from labor supply
behavior or voting behavior of the sort that are implied by models of altruism or inequality aversion.
The one exception is the labor market behavior under the DD-low treatment, where we estimate a
significant altruism effect. However, even there, the effect we estimate is very small in magnitude
(A = 0.05).
The findings from the experiment lead to some strong conclusions, but leave open a number of
more difficult questions that are beyond the scope of the analysis presented here. There are at least
two intriguing unanswered questions about behavior in these experiments. First there is the surprising
result about undersupply of labor by the highest productivity workers in the high inequality treatment.
Such behavior is inconsistent with selfish behavior as well as altruistic or inequality averse behavior.
Second, we observe some variation in tax rates across different groups and across periods.
More general questions concern the robustness of our findings to richer environments. The findings
are suggestive of rather general phenomena, but as a first exploration of these phenomena in the
laboratory, our experimental environment was necessarily very stark. What happens if there are more
agents, more complicated political institutions involving multiple layers and branches of government,
progressive tax structures, or dynamic considerations such as income mobility or investment in human
capital? The taxes we consider are purely redistributional, but many government expenditures are not
purely redistributional and involve investments in public infrastructure, social insurance, and other
categories that have a significant public good component. There are also interesting questions about
the effect of tax rates on tax compliance, an issue that is beyond the scope of the present study.
All of these issues are important to understand the relationships between public finance and political
economy more deeply, and some of them are already being explored theoretically and empirically. We
are hopeful that this paper opens the door for further investigation of these issues using laboratory
experiments as a complement to theoretical and empirical studies.

Appendix B. Instructions for DD-High treatment.
Welcome
You are about to participate in an experiment on decision-making and you will be paid for your participation in cash privately at the end of the session.
The currency in this experiment is called tokens. All payoffs are denominated in this currency. Tokens
that you earn during the experiment will be converted into US dollars using the rate 200 Tokens =
$1. In addition, you will be paid a $10 participation fee if you complete the experiment. The money
you earn will depend on your decisions and the decisions of others.
Do not talk to or attempt to communicate with other participants during the session. Please take
a minute and turn off all electronic devices, especially phones. During the experiment you are not
allowed to open or use any other applications on these laboratory computers, except for the interface
of the experiment.
The experiment consists of two parts. Each part is self-contained and consists of 10 rounds. Before the
beginning of each part, we will read out loud detailed instructions about that part and the computer
interface will be explained.
Part I: There will be 10 rounds in Part 1.
Before the first round begins, all participants will be randomly divided into groups of 5 participants
each. In addition, each participant will be assigned a value V. Your group assignment and your assigned value will stay the same V for all 10 rounds of Part I.
There are 5 possible values of V: V = 2, V=6, V=10, V=14 and V=35. One member in each group
will be assigned V = 2, one member V=6, one member V=10, one member V=14 and one member
V=35. The computer will do the assignments randomly. Your assigned value will be displayed on
your computer screen.

33

Your task in each round is to choose an investment level. Your investment can be any number between 0 and 25 (up to two decimal places). If you choose investment X and your value is V, this will
generate your total investment earnings equal to V*X. For example, if V = 10 and X=4, then your
total investment earnings in that round are computed by 10*4=40 tokens.
However, investment is not free. The cost to you of investing X is equal to 0.5 ∗ X 2 In the example
just given, the investment of X=4 costs you 8 tokens. These costs are subtracted from your earnings
at the end of the round.
A portion of your investment earnings for the round will be taxed. If the tax rate is T%, then your
taxes will equal T% of your investment earnings, and you will keep the remaining (100-T)% of your
investment earnings. The amount you keep after taxes is called your after tax investment earnings.
Recall the example just given, where V = 10 and X=4, and your total investment earnings is 40
tokens. If the tax rate is 50% then your taxes equal 20 tokens and your after tax investment earnings,
which are yours to keep, equal 20 tokens.
The taxes everyone in your group pays are not thrown away. Rather, the total taxes collected from all
members of your group are rebated to the group members in equal shares at the end of each round.
For example, if the total amount collected as taxes from all members of the group equals 200 tokens,
then each member will receive back one fifth of this amount, or 40 tokens. Note that all members of
the group are taxed at the same tax rate in a round, and all group members share equally the total
taxes collected in the group.
To summarize up, your payoff in a round depend on the value V assigned to you at the beginning of
round 1, your investment X, tax rate T and the tax rebate, which is determined by the total taxes
collected from all members in your group. Your total earnings in a round consist of three parts
Total Earnings = Your After Tax Investment Earnings - Your Cost of Investment + Tax Rebate

Thus, your total earnings for the round in this example would be equal to 20 - 8 + 40 = 52 tokens.
At the beginning of each round a tax rate T will be displayed on your screen. This tax rate is the
same for all members in your group. However, your group’s tax rate may change from round to round.
After observing your group’s tax rate, you and all other members of your group will be asked to
independently choose your investment levels, which can be any non-negative number between 0 and
25 up to two decimal places.
The screen has a calculator to assist you in deciding how much to invest in each round. The first row of
the calculator displays your group’s tax rate. You can calculate your hypothetical earnings for a round
by entering two different numbers. Enter a hypothetical investment level choice in the second row
and a hypothetical total taxes from the other four members of your group in the third row. You can
use the up and down buttons to try different hypothetical levels. The fourth row then displays what
your total earnings for the round would be if those hypothetical amounts were the actual amounts in
that round. (If you enter these manually instead of using the buttons, you will need to press ”Enter”
for the calculator to work.) The numbers you enter in the calculator are just hypothetical and do not
affect your actual earnings. Remember that your tax rebate consist of one fifth of the taxes collected
from your investment earnings and one fifth of the taxes collected from the other members of the group.
After everyone has entered their investment decision and clicked on the ”submit button”, the computer
will display your investment decision as well as the investment decisions made by all the other members of your group. It will appear in a table that also shows their values. All of your own information
34

is highlighted in Red on the table. It will also show your earnings for the round, in tokens, broken
down into its three components: after tax investment income, cost of investment, and tax rebate. All
of this information is also summarized at the bottom of your screen in the history panel. The history
panel will keep track of everything that has happened in your group in all rounds, highlighting your
own information in red.
When round 1 is finished, we will move on directly to the next round. The next round will be identical
to the previous round except your group’s new tax rate T will be posted on your screen.
Summary of Part I:
• Part I of the experiment consists of 10 rounds.
• Before the beginning of round 1, participants are divided into groups of 5 members each.
• Each member of the group is assigned value V: one member gets V=2, one gets V=6, one gets
V=10, one gets V=14 and one gets V=35.
• The assignment of values and the group assignments are fixed for all 10 rounds of Part I.
• In each round, a tax rate T is displayed on the screen. All members of the same group observe
the same tax rate T.
• Each member chooses an investment X (number between 0 and 25 with up to two decimal
places).
• Decisions and earnings for that round are displayed on your screen and recorded in the history
panel
Part II: Part II of the experiment also consists of 10 rounds. The group assignments do not change.
They are exactly the same as in Part I. Everyone also keeps the same assigned value as in Part I. Just
to remind you, there is one member in your group who was assigned V = 2, one member V=6, one
member V=10, one member V=14 and one member V=35.
Each round in Part II is similar to rounds in Part I of the experiment, except that at the beginning
of each round all members of the group are asked to submit a proposal for the tax rate T.
While you are deciding what tax rate you wish to propose, the screen has a calculator to assist you
in deciding. You can calculate your hypothetical earnings for a round by entering three different
numbers. Enter a hypothetical group tax rate in the first row of the calculator. Enter a hypothetical
investment decision of yours in the second row and a hypothetical total taxes from the other four
members of your group in the third row. You can use the up and down buttons to try different hypothetical levels. The fourth row then displays what your total earnings for the round would be if those
hypothetical amounts were the actual amounts in that round. (If you enter these manually instead of
using the buttons, you will need to press ”Enter” for the calculator to work.) The numbers you enter
in the calculator are just hypothetical and do not affect your actual earnings. Remember that your
tax rebate consist of one fifth of the taxes collected from your investment earnings and one fifth of the
taxes collected from the other members of the group.
After each member of your group has submitted a proposed tax rate, the third highest of the five
proposed tax rates is implemented as your group’s tax rate for that round. The chosen tax rate will
be clearly posted on your screen and is the same for everyone in your group. You will then be asked to
35

choose an investment decision (as you did in the Part I of the experiment). Your investment decision
can be any number between 0 and 25 up to two decimal places. You may use the calculator to explore
different hypothetical scenarios, as you did in part I.
Once everyone in your group submits their investments, your payoff will be determined and we move
on to the next round of the experiment.
As before, your payoff in a round depend on the value V assigned to you at the beginning of round
1, your investment X, tax rate T and the tax return, which is determined by the total taxes collected
from all members in your group.
More precisely, your Payoff in a round consist of three parts:
Total Earnings = Your After Tax Investment Earnings - Your Cost of Investment + Tax Rebate
