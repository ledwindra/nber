Do Beliefs Justify Actions or Do Actions Justify Beliefs? An Experiment on Stated Beliefs,
Revealed Beliefs, and Social-Image Manipulation

JEL No. C9,D03,D83
ABSTRACT
We study whether actions are justified by beliefs, as is usually assumed, or whether beliefs are justified
by actions. In our experiment, subjects participate in a trust game, after which they have an opportunity
to state their beliefs about their opponent's actions. Subsequently, subjects participate in a task designed
to "reveal" their true beliefs. We find that subjects who make selfish choices and show strategic sophistication
falsely state their beliefs in order to project a more favorable social image. By contrast, their "revealed"
beliefs were significantly more accurate, which betrayed these subjects as knowing that their selfishness
was not justifiable by their opponent's behavior.

“And if, to be sure, sometimes you need to conceal a fact with words, do it in such a way
that it does not become known, or, if it does become known, that you have a ready and
quick defence.”
-Niccoló Machiavelli, 1522

We investigate if concerns of social image affect how individuals express their
beliefs. It has already been established in several studies that individuals care
about how others view them 1. Our investigation centers on whether and how
individuals mitigate selfish behavior by manipulating perceptions of their beliefs.
We begin by demonstrating that individuals may not have a true preference for
fairness or reciprocity, but rather are motivated by their concern over their socialor self- image. In other words, individuals have a preference for appearing to be
fair, instead of actually behaving fairly. Further, this concern over image will not
motivate selfish individuals to change their selfish behavior. Instead, imageconscious selfish individuals will maintain their selfish behavior, but go out of
their way to create the false impression that they are cooperative. We then
demonstrate the strategies by which image-conscious selfish individuals create
the false impression that they are cooperative. We propose that individuals, with
the intention of maintaining their social image, purposely manipulate information
they know others might use to evaluate their actions. Specifically, we look at
whether individuals who take a selfish action will subsequently lie about the
beliefs they held when they took that action in a way that mitigates their selfish
behavior.

The novelty of our paper is to compare two different belief elicitation methods
to expose subjects’ motivations and strategies. In our approach we look at the
difference between stated beliefs, the beliefs subjects express when their social
image is at stake, and revealed beliefs, the beliefs subjects express when their
entire payoff is at stake. To our knowledge we are the first to introduce this
method of comparing belief elicitation methods as well as introducing the
revealed beliefs elicitation device itself. We conduct a modified trust game, after
which we obtain the two measures of beliefs. First, we directly ask subjects to
state the beliefs they held when they made certain decisions. We term these
stated beliefs, as there are no monetary consequences for stating inaccurate
beliefs. Second, we implement a belief elicitation device where subjects
indirectly express their beliefs by placing bets on different game outcomes. We
term these revealed beliefs, as subjects’ entire payoff is as stake and subjects are
unaware that their beliefs are being measured. We find that subjects who take a
selfish action in the trust game subsequently exhibited large differences between
their stated beliefs and their revealed beliefs. Selfish subjects stated that they
believed their opponent also took a selfish action. However, in contrast with
what they stated when asked directly, selfish subjects staked their payoff on the
chance that their opponent took a cooperative action. Thus, these subjects were
revealed to believe that their opponent was in fact cooperative. By comparison,
subjects who took a cooperative action in the trust game do not display this
difference between their stated and revealed beliefs. In order to rule out
confusion as an explanation for the difference between stated and revealed
beliefs we measure the decision-making sophistication of subjects. Sophisticated
subjects are subjects who did not violate stochastic dominance in the revealed
elicitation task 2. Our key result is that we find that the subjects with the largest

2

Please see Section II for a complete explanation of how subjects’ sophistication was determined.

3

differences between their stated and revealed beliefs are the subjects who are
both selfish and sophisticated.
We suggest that the reason for the disparity between the selfish subjects’ stated
and revealed beliefs is that these selfish individuals are precluded from using
their action to signal a positive social image. Instead, the selfish players must
use their stated beliefs to signal their motivation in making a selfish decision and
in doing so, mitigate their selfish actions and preserve a positive social image.
On the other hand, subjects who have taken the cooperative action can signal a
positive social image with their action alone and thus, would have no need to
alter their social image through their stated beliefs.
Underlying these behavioral propositions is the hypothesis that individuals have
a skilled understanding of the way others think. In particular, we propose that
individuals understand the cognitive processes fundamental in judgment and that
it is this sophisticated understanding of how humans judge others that may
explain why sophisticated-selfish subjects express two contradictory beliefs. We
propose that the sophisticated-selfish subjects use stated beliefs as an opportunity
to influence others’ perception of their selfish decisions whereas the revealed
beliefs capture their “true” beliefs. We find that first-movers believe that
second-movers will be more generous when the second-movers believe the firstmover intended to be generous. A key finding is that sophisticated-selfish
second-movers are able to anticipate this belief and are able to alter their stated
beliefs to match this expectation.
Moreover, we do not find evidence in support of positive reciprocity. Even
when players believe that their partner has been generous toward them, they do
not positively reciprocate as would be predicted by many theories of reciprocity.
Importantly, we find that these players go out of their way to state on the stated

4

belief elicitation that they believed the other player was unkind to them. Again,
when we examine these same players’ incentivized revealed beliefs, we find that
they did in fact believe that their partner was generous and were willing to stake
their entire payoff on this fact. Thus it seems unlikely that their selfish actions
were driven by a preference for reciprocity. Rather, our results indicate that
reciprocity may be followed only when there are no viable excuses to relieve the
obligation to return kindness for kindness. When even under a small amount of
social pressure, subjects will go out of their way to “blame the victim” to relieve
themselves of the social responsibility to be generous.
Our results have important implications for policy. Previous research has focused
on eliciting emotional reactions in individuals in order to influence charitable
donations or encouraging adhesion to social norms in order to motivate prosocial
behavior. In light of our results, the strategies promoted by previous work may,
in fact, drive people away from other-regarding behavior.
Given that beliefs seem to be playing a larger role in theory and are being
increasingly relied upon as an explanation for behavior, it seems prudent to
examine whether beliefs are influenced by social demand. This demand can take
the form of experimenter demand, audience demand, or demand of societal
expectation. Perhaps subjects write beliefs that they want to use as “socially
acceptable excuses” to validate and explain why they behaved as they did.
Further, humans may know how to give the “right answers” to project their
image of themselves to others (that is, manipulate others’ perceptions. If this is
indeed the case, careful attention must be paid to all of the incentives faced by
individuals when measuring their beliefs.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section I provides background on social
influence, social preferences and beliefs; Section II describes the experimental

5

design and predictions; Section III presents the results; Section IV provides
discussion; and Section V concludes. Readers familiar with the literature on
social preferences and beliefs may wish to skip directly to Section II.

I. Interaction of Social Preferences and Beliefs
Social pressure in varying forms, such as reciprocity and guilt aversion, has been
shown to produce prosocial behavior in lab settings (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999;
Charness and Rabin, 2002; Charness and Levin, 2007; Charness and Haruvey,
2002; Blount, 1993). However, previous research has taken for granted that
individuals’ only alternative in the face of social pressure is to behave
cooperatively. Recent evidence has suggested that a concern for projecting a
social image of being fair or reciprocal dominates concerns for reciprocity or
fairness and those individuals only appear to have concerns regarding fairness,
reciprocity and intentions. When confronted with an opportunity to give, a
selfish person may give if they feel that their social or self image is at stake.
These individuals may truly prefer to be self-regarding, but refrain under social
pressure (Andreoni and Bernheim, 2009; Dana, et. al 2007). For example
Andreoni and Bernheim (2009) use a variation of the Dictator game to test for
social image concerns. In their design, nature sometimes intervenes on the
Dictator’s decision, forcing them to choose to keep the whole endowment. The
recipient cannot observe if nature intervened. They found that when there was
zero chance that any unfavorable outcome could be attributed to the external
source (nature), Dictators ceded 50 percent of their endowment to the recipient.
However, as soon as the chance of nature intervening reached 25 percent,
Dictators’ other-regarding behavior quickly reversed and many Dictators
switched to choosing the entire endowment for themselves. The authors
concluded that individuals have a strong preference for being perceived as being
fair, which dominates their other-regarding concerns. In another relevant finding,

6

Dana, et. al. (2007) find that Dictators chose to remain ignorant of the
consequences of their actions so as to retain the “moral wiggle room” to act
selfishly.
In addition to preferences, beliefs have played an important role in explaining
prosocial behavior 3. Several past studies have incorporated beliefs about subject
intentions in models of reciprocity (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999; Levine, 1998;
Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger, 2004; Falk and Fischbacher, 2006). These models
claim that individuals’ actions are motivated by their beliefs about the intentions
of others. Individuals will go out of their way to reward those who have
intentionally shown them kindness and punish those who have intentionally hurt
them even if doing so is costly to the rewarder/punisher (Falk and Fischbacher,
2000; Andreoni, Brown, and Vesterlund, 2002; Charness and Rabin, 2002;
Charness and Levin, 2007; Charness and Haruvey, 2002; Blount, 1993). While
previous studies of social preferences have made a point of using beliefs to
provide motivation for other-regarding preferences, many of these papers have
studied beliefs only indirectly or, if measured directly, only impose a small cost
to subjects for lying. In a separate study, Dufwenberg et al. (2006) elicited

3

Many theories of social preferences have allowed for belief-dependent motivation based off of

Geanakopolos, Pearce and Stacchetti (1989) and Gilboa and Schmeidler (1988) who found that
traditional methods were inadequate in representing preferences that exhibit belief-dependent
motivations. Rabin’s (1993) reciprocity theory, in which a Player’s preferences over material
payoff distributions are influenced by the co-players intentions, is a well-known application of
“psychological” game theory. Several extensions of Rabin’s 1993 theory, including Dufwenberg
and Kirsteiger (2004) and Battigalli and Dufwenberg (2009) have illustrated the importance of
incorporating updated beliefs, others’ beliefs, and players’ plans of how they intend to play. For
example, Battigalli and Dufwenberg (2007) suggest that individuals care about what other people
give to others in order to avoid aversive feelings of guilt based on co-players beliefs and
expectations.

beliefs in one-shot public goods games to explore the impact of framing and to
assess theories of reciprocity and guilt-aversion. They found that when players
know they are expected to be other-regarding they give according to what they
believe others expect of them.

II. Experimental Design and Predictions
Each session consisted of three stages. In the first stage, subjects play a modified
Trust game with binary choices. We employ the strategy method: subjects were
asked to make binding choices for different scenarios, and paid based on one
randomly chosen scenario at the end of the session. All choices were made with
paper and pencil. In the second and third stages we collect non-incentivized
stated beliefs and incentivized elicited beliefs, respectively.
A. Stage 1: Choices

We use a variation of the Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe Trust (1995) game that
restricts all players to binary choices. This was done to facilitate the belief
elicitation in Stage 3. In Stage 1 subjects are randomly divided into pairs and
randomly assigned to roles as Player 1 (P1) or Player 2 (P2). To begin, $10 is
placed into player 1’s “account”. Player 1 now decides either to send the whole
$10 to player 2 or to send $2 to player 2 and keep $8. The amount sent to player
2 is tripled. Player 2 decides how much of the tripled transfer they received,𝑥𝑥 to
return to player 1. Player 2 must decide between two options: (1) whether to
return 𝑥𝑥/2 to player 1 and keep 𝑥𝑥/2 , or, (2) return 𝑥𝑥/6 to player 1 and keep

5𝑥𝑥/6. Further, with probability 1 − 𝑝𝑝, player 1’s choice determines the amount
transferred to player 2 (either $10 or $2), and, with probability 𝑝𝑝 nature

intervenes and the “Experimenter” forces player 1 to send the whole $10 to
player 2. We examine choices for six different values of p, p ϵ (0, 0.05, 0.20,
0.40, 0.60, and 1). The parameter 𝑝𝑝 is common knowledge, but player 2 cannot

8

observe whether nature intervened. We employ the strategy method to elicit
choices for all six values of 𝑝𝑝: each player makes choices on six different

“Decision Sheets”. Player 1 subjects make a total of 6 choices: one choice on
each of 6 sheets by marking whether they would choose to send $10 or $2 to
player 2 for each sheet (even the treatment where 𝑝𝑝 = 1). By comparison, player
2 subjects make 12 total choices: a conditional choice for the possibility that $10
is sent, and, a conditional choice for the possibility that $2 is sent for each value
of 𝑝𝑝. For ease of reference, a diagram of the game is provided in Figure 1.

Figure 1 – (a) Modified Trust Game structure with payoffs. (b)Game Timing – All players move
simultaneously without knowing what the other has chosen. Only after receiving payment in Stage 4 can
players infer their opponent’s moves.

B. Stage 2: Non-Incentivized “Stated” Beliefs

After all players made their choices, Decision Sheets were collected. Subjects
were then told, “We would like to know what you think the other player sent
you”. The Belief Elicitation Stages (Stages 2 and 3) were not announced to the
subjects until after each subject had made their choices in the first stage and the
Decision Sheets were collected. Each subject wrote their predictions on their

9

own form called the Prediction Sheet. It was made clear to subjects that there
was no penalty or reward for accuracy.
Player 1 subjects were asked to predict the chances that player 2 would send
back different amounts of money to player 1 under three different scenarios. It
was publically stated that (a) if $10 is sent to player 2, player 2 could send back
either $15 or $5 to player 1, (b) if $2 is sent to player 2, player 2 could send back
either $3 or $1 to player 1, and (c) player 2 makes a conditional choice for each
possibility. It was also common knowledge that in each condition there existed a
chance that nature could “override” player 1’s choice and force player 1 to send
$10 to player 2. Therefore, there were two beliefs player 2 could have held about
who was responsible for sending the $10: first, player 1 was responsible
themselves for sending the $10, or, second, player 1 was forced by the
Experimenter to send the $10. This stage was designed to test if individuals
operate on the assumption that their intentions will be taken into account when
being judged by others. Therefore, player 1 was asked to predict the chances that
player 2 sent back $15 or $5 for each of two possibilities: first, if player 2
believed player 1 was responsible for sending the $10 and second, if player 2
believed player 1 was not responsible for sending the $10 (i.e. player 1 was
forced by the Experimenter). Player 1 was then asked to predict the chances that
player 2 sent $3 or $1 back to player 1 under the $2 possibility. Player 1 made
predictions for all six values of 𝑝𝑝. Again, it was made clear to subjects that there
was no penalty or reward given for accuracy.

Player 2 subjects were asked to predict the chances that player 1 would send
either $10 or $2. They were specifically instructed to predict the chances that
player 1 chose $10 or $2 on their Decision Sheet and not the chances that player
2 would receive $10 or $2 (which depends on the chances that player 1’s

10

decision is chosen). Player 2 made predictions for all six values of 𝑝𝑝. Again,
there was no penalty or reward given for accuracy.

C. Stage 3: Incentivized “Revealed” Belief Elicitation

We employ a unique method in order to measure first-order beliefs about what
player 1 and player 2 thought the other player had done. We use a Multiple Price
List style approach to measure player 1 and player 2’s preference between two
payment options. An advantage of our method over other elicitation methods is
that our method is not affected by risk aversion. Subjects were informed that
they would be making a series of decisions on “how they would like to be paid”
on a Payment Option Form. Option 1 is the “Outcome of the Game”. If players
choose this option, they are paid based on the outcome of the game they played
with their opponent. Subjects knew that the payment they would receive under
this option, either $𝑥𝑥/6 (the “low” amount) or $5𝑥𝑥/6 (the “high” amount),

depended in part on what the other player chose to send them. Option 2 was a 𝑞𝑞
chance of receiving $𝑥𝑥/6 and a 1 − 𝑞𝑞 chance of receiving $5𝑥𝑥/6. Option 2

varied in incremental steps of 5 percent, which ranged from a 0 percent chance of
receiving $𝑥𝑥/6 and a 100 percent chance of receiving $5𝑥𝑥/6, to a 100 percent

chance of receiving $𝑥𝑥/6 and a 0 percent chance of receiving $5𝑥𝑥/6 . The two
amounts of money, $𝑥𝑥/6 and $5𝑥𝑥/6, are the same two amounts of money the
player could earn if they were to choose the Outcome of the Game option

(Option 1). However, instead of their payment relying upon what the other
player chose to send them (as under the Outcome of the Game Option), the
payment under Option 2 depended solely upon the chances they saw listed under
Option 2. Therefore, the row at which a subject decides to switch from Option 2
to Option 1 reveals the range of values of their belief about what the other player
has chosen to send them. Subjects fill out one Payment Option Form for each of

11

their six Decision Sheets 4. Since the first row under Option 2 gives the player a
100 percent chance of receiving the high amount, rational subjects who
understand the game should initially prefer Option 2, if they believe that there is
less than a 100 percent chance they will receive the high amount under Option
1. 5
Whereas most previous studies infer beliefs solely from analyzing subjects’
choices or use a scoring rule to elicit beliefs, we elicit beliefs not once, but twice,
and exploit the difference between the two measures to expose subjects’ motives.
Our study differs from previous studies of beliefs which have implemented a
scoring rule technique (quadratic loss function, etc.) to elicit accurate beliefs.
Subjects in the studies utilizing a scoring rule receive a “bonus” from accurately
reporting beliefs in addition to the money earned from playing any game in
4

Previous price list style experiments have documented that a portion of subjects tend to switch

multiple times between the two options presented (Holt and Laury, 2002; Meier and Sprenger,
2010; and Jacobsen and Petrie, 2009). It is generally accepted that since multiple switch points can
indicate subject confusion and are difficult to rationalize, a framing device may be necessary to
avoid subject confusion and clarify the decision process (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012). We used
animated instructions in order to illustrate the directions for the subjects. Out of 82 subjects, two
subjects had multiple switch points on one or more of their Payment Option forms and one subject
who switched “backwards” (starting with Option 1 and later switching to Option 2).
5

Under Option 2, the probability of receiving the high amount declines with each descending

row, while the probability of receiving the low amount increases with each descending row. At the
row where a subject believes that they would have a higher probability of receiving the high
amount from the other Player than the probability they see under Option 2, the subject has the
incentive to switch to Option 1. Thus the row where each subject switches allows us to infer their
belief about the chances of the other Player sending the high amount. In addition, we verbally
instructed subjects that “Most people begin by preferring Option 2 and then switch to Option 1.
Thus one way to view this task is to determine the best row to stop checking the box under Option
2 and start checking the box for Option 1”

12

which they had participated. Thus, only a small portion of each subject’s
payments come from accurately reporting beliefs. If any subject wished to
conceal their true beliefs they would only need to sacrifice a small percentage of
their entire payment to do so. So, while these scoring rules do offer monetary
incentives to accurately report beliefs, there is no way to tell if subjects who wish
to lie about their beliefs would give up their “bonus” in order to signal a false
belief to the experimenter. In contrast, our method of eliciting revealed beliefs
has higher stakes for the subjects. Each subject’s entire payout for the
experiment is determined from their decision on the revealed belief elicitation
task. Furthermore, while it is obvious to subjects that researchers are collecting
their beliefs when using a scoring rule, it is not obvious to subjects that we are
measuring their beliefs on the revealed belief task. This is so for two reasons.
First, subjects had just completed the stated belief task. Recall, the stated belief
task was labeled as the “Prediction Sheet” on which the subjects were asked to
make predictions about how the other player had behaved. On the Prediction
Sheet, we asked subjects to tell us “What do you believe the other player sent to
you?” Thus, the framing of the stated belief task made salient that we were
inquiring about subjects’ beliefs. In contrast, the aspect most salient for subjects
in the revealed belief task was that their payment for the entire experiment was
“on the line”. Recall that the revealed belief task was labeled as the “Payment
Option Form” on which subjects were instructed that “Now tell us how you
would like to be paid.” On the Payment Option Form, the subjects had two
“payment” options. Subjects could either choose to be paid from the “Outcome
of the Game” they had just played with their opponent, or, they could choose the
outside gamble. Thus, the framing of the revealed belief task nudged subjects
toward focusing on their payment.

13

After Stage 3, player 1 rolled the dice in order to determine whether it would be
player 1’s decision that would be chosen or if player 1’s decision would be
overridden (i.e., the Experimenter’s decision would be used instead). In order to
maintain anonymity, all subjects rolled the dice.
D. Predictions
Prediction 1- Social Image Perception Manipulation: Individuals who exhibit
selfish behavior in Stage 1 will justify this social behavior on their “stated”
beliefs (Stage 2) by “blaming the victim.”
Prediction 2- Revealed Deceit: Selfish individuals will exhibit a difference
between what they “state” they believe on their stated beliefs and what they are
“revealed” to believe on their revealed beliefs.
We propose that selfish individuals deem that their selfish action will be
evaluated in a kinder light if they are perceived as reacting to a belief that their
opponent was selfish rather than if they are perceived as truly believing that their
opponent acted kindly toward them and subsequently taking advantage of this
kindness. Since selfish individuals can no longer use their actions to signal their
type to the experimenter, they must rely on the only means left available to
maintain their social image: others’ perceptions of their beliefs. Consequently,
selfish individuals wishing to maintain their social image will state on their
“stated” beliefs that they believe that there is a low probability of their opponent
voluntarily sending the high amount and a high probability that their opponent
will send them the low amount. This serves as an excuse for a selfish
individual’s behavior. However, we predict that not all of these individuals truly
believe that their opponents were selfish. We posit that selfish individuals will
be willing to risk their entire payment for the experiment on their true belief that
their opponent was kind to them by sending the high amount. Thus, revealing

14

that they believe they have a better chance of receiving the high amount from
their opponent rather than from the outside gamble 6.
Prediction 3- Sophistication: The selfish individuals who are more sophisticated
will be the individuals most likely to lie about their stated beliefs.
Our design allows us to separate out individuals who are more sophisticated
decision makers. We term subjects who switched to Option 1 immediately on the
last Payment Option form as being “Sophisticated” 7. We predict that since these
subjects are capable of understanding complex situations they are the subjects
who would best be able to navigate situations in which they need to cover over
their bad deeds. Examining the behavior of these “sophisticated” subjects can
also help to rule out confusion as a factor in any differences seen between stated
and revealed beliefs.

III. Main Findings
Eight-two subjects were recruited from the undergraduate population at
University of California, San Diego. Each session was conducted at the
Economics Laboratory at UC San Diego and ran between an hour and 30
minutes and two hours. Each subject maintained the same role (player 1 or
player 2) throughout. Average earnings were $19, including a $7 participation
fee, with a standard deviation of $8.16. Payoffs ranged from $10 to $32.
6 Recall that the payment received under Option 1 is dependent on the action of their opponent. Therefore,
the sooner a subject “switches” to Option 1 the higher is their belief about their opponent sending them the
high amount.
7

Recall that on the Stage 3 “Revealed” Belief elicitation form players are faced with two payment options:
Option 1, receiving a payment from the outcome of the game played with their opponent and Option 2,
receiving a payment from an outside gamble. Recall also that for the last Decision Sheet and corresponding
Payment Option form the chance that the Experimenter will force player 1 to send the whole $10 to player 2
is 100 percent . Therefore, player 2 will receive $15 (the highest amount) with 100 percent probability.
Therefore, it is in a player’s best interest to switch to Option 1 (payment from the game) immediately since
there is a 100 percent chance they will receive $15 from the game, while there is less than 100 percent
chance they will receive $15 from the outside gamble.

15

A. Choice Behavior

Result 1a – Selfish Behavior: As the chance that player 1 is forced by the
Experimenter to send $10 increases, the fraction of player 2s returning $15 (an
Equal split) declines steadily.

Figure 2 -Fraction of player 2s returning equal split to player 1 as the chance that player 1 was forced to
be generous to player 2 increases

As can be seen in Figure 2 approximately 30 percent of player 2s return $15 to
player 1 when (as was publically stated) there is zero chance that player 1 was
forced to send $10. In this case (p =0), player 2s know with certainty that if they
receive $10 that it was player 1 who decided to send the $10 and it was of their
own volition. Therefore, responsibility for sending the $10 is unambiguous to
player 2s. However, as the chance that player 1 will be forced to send $10
increases, the fraction of player 2s reciprocating by returning an equal split of
$15 declines. There is a small increase in the number of player 2s returning $15

16

on the last decision sheet, where the probability of player 1 being forced to send
$10 reaches 100 percent.
The first column of Table 1 reports the estimates of a random-effects probit
model of the probability of player 2 returning $15 in the case where $10 is sent
to them. The second column reports the probability of player 2 returning $3 in
the case where $2 is sent to them. The explanatory variables include indicators
for 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.05, 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.20, 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.40, 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.60, and p=1 (with p = 0 omitted). In
all cases, we report marginal effects at mean values. As we are most interested
in player 2 reaction to knowledge that player 1 could have been forced to send
$10, we focus on the results in the first column. The coefficients in the first
column imply that there is a statistically significant decrease in the probability of
player 2 returning $15 when p rises from 0.05 to 0.20, from 0.20 to 0.40, from
0.40 to 0.60 and from p=0.60 to 1.

We now turn to player 1 choice behavior. Figure 3 shows the fraction of player
1s who voluntarily chose to send $10 to player 2. When the probability of being
forced to send the whole $10 to player 2 is zero, around 30 percent of player 1s
voluntarily choose to send $10. The fraction player 1s voluntarily choosing to
send $10 increases gradually as the probability that they will be forced to do so
increases. When the probability of being forced to send $10 is 100 percent, half
of player 1s voluntarily choose to send $10. Table 2 shows the marginal effects
from a random effects regression. The specification describes the probability of
selecting $10. The explanatory variables include indicators for 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.05, 𝑝𝑝 ≥
0.20, 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.40, 𝑝𝑝 ≥ 0.60, and p=1 (with p = 0 omitted). We report marginal

18

effects at mean values. The coefficients imply that the only statistically
significant increase in the probability of voluntarily choosing to send $10 occurs
when p rises from 0.60 to 1 (𝛼𝛼 < 0.10, one tailed t-test).

B. Examing Beliefs: What Subjects Say They Believe Versus What They Reveal They
Believe

Figure 4 shows stated beliefs, revealed beliefs and the actual frequency of player
1 sending $10 to player 2 (notice that this is the probability of player 1
voluntarily choosing $10 and not the probability that player 2 will receive $10).
What is apparent from cursory examination is that there is a constant difference
of approximately 20 percentage points between what player 2s state they believe

20

and what player 2s are revealed to believe. This difference is statistically
significant for all six values of p.

Figure 4 - Difference between player 2 "Stated" vs. true "Revealed" Beliefs

In order to further investigate the cause of this large difference between stated
and revealed beliefs, we break the player 2s into four types based on 2
dimensions: Selfishness and Sophistication. We code a player 2 as being
“Selfish” if they chose to send $5 (the lower amount) to player 1 for every value
of p. Otherwise, the subject was coded as “Nice”. We code a player 2 as being
“Sophisticated” if on the Payment Option Form where p = 1, the subject

21

switched from preferring the Outside Gamble (Option 2) to preferring the
Outcome of the Game (Option 1) in Row 1 or Row 2 8.

Result 1b – Sophisticated Social Image Manipulation: Sophisticated-Selfish
player 2s are revealed to believe that there is a much higher chance that player 1
voluntarily sent $10 than they state they believe. Furthermore, the sophisticatedselfish player 2s are capable of accurately predicting the actual frequency that
player 1 voluntarily chose $10, but when asked player 2s state a much lower
probability than was true.
Figure 5 shows the Stated Beliefs, Revealed Beliefs, and Actual Frequency of
player 1 voluntarily choosing to send $10 for each type of player 2
(unsophisticated -nice, unsophisticated -selfish, sophisticated-nice, sophisticatedselfish). Comparing the Actual Frequency line with the Revealed Belief Line,
one can see that sophisticated-selfish player 2s are fully capable of predicting
player 1s’ actions. In fact, there is no statistically significant difference between
the Actual Frequency and the Revealed Belief for p=0, p=0.05, p=0.20, p=0.40.
There is a significant difference for the last two values of p, p=0.60 and p=1.
8

Subjects switching in Row 1 or Row 2 of the Payment Option form would have to be aware that

on the last decision sheet, they were guaranteed to receive $10 as the probability of player 1 being
forced to send $10 was 100 percent on this sheet.

22

There is a substantial increase in the Revealed Beliefs for the last two values of p
which causes the difference. The sophisticated-selfish subjects do not best
respond to their stated beliefs, but to their revealed beliefs. This indicates that the
sophisticated-selfish subjects lie about their beliefs when asked, but do not
believe their own lies. That is, they know what the Actual Frequency of player 1
voluntarily choosing $10 is, but appear to purposely understate this probability.

Figure 5 - Comparison of player 2 "Stated" vs. "Revealed" Beliefs broken down by Sophisticated &
Selfish

Unsophisticated-nice subjects do exhibit a statistically significant difference for
p=0, p=0.05, p=0.20, p=0.40, p=0.60 and p=1. However, there is no
statistically significant difference between unsophisticated-nice subjects’ stated
beliefs and the Actual Frequency. This leads one to conclude that the
unsophisticated-nice subjects fail to best respond to their beliefs in a way that is
overly optimistic. Sophisticated-nice subjects exhibit only occasional differences

23

between stated & revealed, revealed & actual frequency, and stated & actual
frequency. On average, sophisticated-nice subjects best respond to their stated
beliefs, but sometimes fail to best respond to their stated beliefs in favor of being
optimistic. Unsophisticated-selfish subjects exhibit no statistically significant
differences between stated & revealed beliefs, stated beliefs & actual frequency,
and occasional significant differences between revealed beliefs & actual
frequency. This indicates that unsophisticated-selfish subjects are both honest
and realistic in that they truthfully state their beliefs and best respond to these
beliefs.
As a further test, we compare player 2s who have large differences between their
revealed and stated beliefs with player 2s who have little or no difference
between what they say they believe and what they are revealed to believe. Those
player 2s who are “large deviators” are significantly more selfish than those
player 2s with small or no deviations (𝑡𝑡 = 4.06, 𝛼𝛼 < 0.00 two-tailed t-test,
Mann-Whitney 𝑧𝑧 = 3.42, 𝛼𝛼 < 0.00).

Now to shed further light on player 2 behavior, we contrast player 2 belief data
with player 1 behavior on the two belief elicitation tasks. Looking at Figure 6, it
can be seen that player 1s state that they believe that if player 2 believes player 1
is responsible for sending the $10 then player 2 will positively reciprocate. In
Figure 7, we break Pl subjects into two groups, nice and selfish player 1s. player

1s who chose to send $10 to player 2 at least three times are coded as “Nice,”
otherwise they are coded as “Selfish.” Figure 7 displays player 1 Stated Beliefs,
Revealed Beliefs and the Actual Frequency of player 2 returning an equal split.

24

Figure 6 - Player 1 Beliefs about whether player 2 will return High Amount as the probability of player
1 being forced to be generous increases

Result 2- Sophisticated Deception: Player 2s are able to accurately model
player 1’s expectations of player 2 behavior. Both types of player 1s both state
and reveal that they believe that if player 2 believes that player 1 is responsible
for voluntarily sending the $10, that player 2 will reciprocate this kindness by
returning $15.
Both types of player 1s state that they believe that 𝑃𝑃( $15 |𝑃𝑃1 $10) >

𝑃𝑃 ($15 |𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 $10) (pooled: 𝑡𝑡 = 5.79, 𝛼𝛼 < 0.00, Selfish: 𝑡𝑡 = 4.90, 𝛼𝛼 < 0.00,

Nice: 𝑡𝑡 = 3.57, 𝛼𝛼 < 0.00 two tailed t-tests). Now comparing Revealed Beliefs

with Stated Beliefs one can see that not only are both types of player 1s truthful,
but both types are operating on the assumption that player 2 will positively
reciprocate if player 1 is perceived as responsible for voluntarily sending $10.
There is no statistically significant difference between the Revealed Beliefs and

25

the Stated Belief of 𝑃𝑃( $15 |𝑃𝑃1 $10) for both types of player 1s. This indicates

that player 1s predict that player 2 will behave reciprocally, as is the social norm.

Figure 7 - Comparison of Selfish player 1s’ and Nice player 1s’ "Stated" vs. "Revealed" Beliefs

Result 3 : Selfish player 1s understate their beliefs about 𝑃𝑃( $15 |𝑃𝑃1 $10).

The distribution of player 1s who had the largest difference between their

revealed and stated beliefs are significantly more selfish than those player 1s
who had little or no difference between their revealed and stated beliefs (𝑡𝑡 =

1.96, 𝛼𝛼 < 0.025 two tailed t-test). Looking at Figure 7, one can see that player

1s do not exhibit the same degree of deviation from their stated beliefs as

exhibited by player 2s. Also evident from Figure 7 is that “nice” player 1s

26

believe there is a higher chance of receiving the high amount back from player 2
than do the selfish player 1s. Also, selfish player 1s were better at predicting the
Actual Frequency that player 2 would return an equal split than are nice player
1s.

IV. Strategic Image Manipulation
The discrepancy between the beliefs selfish-sophisticated players express on
their stated beliefs and their revealed beliefs raises several questions.
First, which belief represents players “true” beliefs? If sophisticated-selfish
players’ true beliefs are as they stated on their stated beliefs task, then these
players are not best responding to these beliefs on their revealed beliefs task. If
they truly believed that chances of player 1 sending the high amount ($10) were
as low as they stated on their stated beliefs, then this should have been reflected
by their choices on the Payment Option Form in the revealed beliefs task.
Instead, their choices on their Payment Option Form indicate that their true
underlying belief is that there was in fact a higher chance that player 1 had sent
player 2 the high amount ($10). These sophisticated players are the players who
were able to correctly calculate and assess that they were better off switching
early from Option 2 to Option 1 on Decision Sheet 6, where the chance they
would receive the high amount ($10) was 100 percent. Thus, it is difficult to
comprehend how the sophisticated players can understand how to maneuver to
make the most money for themselves in one part of the game and yet be
confused or unable to best respond to their own beliefs on the very same task. In
addition, selfish-sophisticated players demonstrated a keen ability to identify
both the actual frequency of their opponents’ kindness and their opponents’
expectations. Those players who were selfish, but were unsophisticated, showed
more consistency between their stated beliefs on the Prediction Sheet and their

27

revealed beliefs on their Payment Option Form. Lack of concern in social image
may be possible explanation is for the difference in behavior between the
sophisticated and unsophisticated -selfish players. It could be that
unsophisticated players do not have enough knowledge to care about how others
perceive them, or, they do care about how others perceive them but lack the
prowess to manipulate others’ perceptions.
The second question that arises is if their revealed beliefs are in fact more
representative of their “true” beliefs, then what motivates sophisticated-selfish
players to lie about their stated beliefs? We propose that sophisticated-selfish
players intentionally misstate their stated beliefs in an effort to manipulate how
others view their selfish actions. That is to say that sophisticated selfish subjects
attempt to maintain a positive social image by manipulating how others perceive
their selfish actions. Recall that on Figure 6 it was shown that player 1s stated
that they believe that there was a higher chance of positive reciprocity from
player 2 if player 2 believed that player 1, rather than the experimenter, was
personally responsible for sending the high amount. Sophisticated-selfish stated
beliefs coincide directly with their opponents’ expectations. When directly asked
about what they believed when calculating their decision of what amount to
return to player 1, sophisticated-selfish player 2s stated that they believed that
there was a low chance that player 1 had personally sent the high amount. As we
know, this statement is in direct contradiction with their revealed beliefs.
However, this statement does provide player 2 with a ready-made excuse should
anyone inquire about their selfish decision 9. The fact that sophisticated-selfish
player 2s are so well able to anticipate their opponents’ expectations exposes
their keen awareness of and desire to appear to be in compliance with societal
9

Concerns for social image maintenance may arise out of a desire to avoid social retaliation or

revenge (see Andreoni and Gee (2012) for a review).

28

norms. If one were to look solely at sophisticated-selfish players’ actions or their
stated beliefs, it might appear that sophisticated-selfish players had preferences
for reciprocity and that these preferences were their driving decision making
process. However, the revealed beliefs paint a different picture entirely.
Behavior that would previously had been viewed as supporting hypotheses of
reciprocity or guilt-aversion is now shown to support the hypothesis that
individuals are indeed selfish and display a sharp level of sophistication in
manipulating their image. This is not to say that prosocial behavior in the form
of pure or impure altruism does not exist. However, what this does imply is that
if individuals wish to be selfish, attempts to nudge them to cooperate through
appeals to reciprocity or guilt will not alter their choice behavior. In the face of
social pressure to comply with norms sophisticated selfish individuals will not in
fact cooperate, but merely take measures to make others believe they are
complying with social norms.
The third question pertains to whether sophisticated-selfish players believe their
own lies. We suggest that sophisticated-selfish players do not believe their own
lies and that these players knowingly misstate the beliefs when they think that
others will be able to observe their beliefs, as in the stated beliefs task. If
sophisticated-selfish players truly believed that their opponent was selfish, then
in order to have the best chance to earn the most money in the game they would
have need to make entirely different choices on the Payment Option form in
revealed belief elicitation task. Again, confusion seems unlikely as an
explanation for their choices on this task since this set of players were the most
sophisticated. In addition, their choices on the Payment Option Form in the
revealed belief task match up with the actual frequency of cooperation from their
opponents. This implies that sophisticated-selfish players are very apt at
predicting exactly how kind their opponents were in the game. Therefore, it

29

seems unlikely that sophisticated-selfish players believed what they stated on
their stated beliefs task. However, the question of whether the sophisticated
players believe their own lies remains an open question and deserves more study.
A fourth and unanswered question is whether sophisticated-selfish subjects
believe their own lies are credible and whether their lies are believed by
observers? This remains an open question that deserves more study and is not
directly addressed within our paper.

V. Conclusion
In order to examine whether image concerns affect how individuals express their
beliefs we implement a new technique of contrasting two differing belief
elicitation measures that identify both what people say they believe, and what
they are revealed to believe. We find evidence that selfish, image-conscious
individuals will lie about the beliefs they held about their opponent when
carrying out this selfish action. Specifically, selfish players state that they
believed their opponent would act selfishly toward them. However, in the
revealed beliefs elicitation selfish players stake their entire payoff on the
opposite belief, that their opponent was in fact cooperative. In order to rule out
confusion, we measure the “sophistication” of each subject. Evidence indicates
that it is the individuals who are both sophisticated and selfish who are the most
frequent users of the manipulation mechanism. While previous studies of
reciprocity concluded that players’ beliefs about their opponents’ intentions
revealed that their subjects had a preference for reciprocity, our results contradict
this finding. Our results suggest that individuals have a preference for being
perceived as being cooperative instead of actually behaving cooperatively. Thus,
if one wishes to take a selfish or uncooperative action, they can do so without

30

fear of retaliation or punishment so long as they concoct a socially acceptable
story justifying their selfish behavior.
Our results have important policy implications. Previous studies have advocated
appeals to individuals’ emotions in order to promote cooperative behavior.
However, our results indicate that guilt may in fact cause selfish individuals to
not only act selfishly, but to cover up their selfish actions with lies. In fact, recent
evidence from the healthcare field indicates that when doctors make their
patients feel “guilty” about being overweight or other unhealthy behaviors a
significant number of patients not only maintained their undesired behavior, but
also lied and told their doctors that they had changed their behavior to the desired
behavior (Darby, et.al. 2014).
We believe our results also serve as a caution for studying data in situations
where social image is especially heightened. For example, the use of “big data”
analytics from social networking websites has become popular. Large consumer
firms and political campaigns have begun to rely on data gleaned from social
media sites. However, since social image is particularly salient to individuals
frequenting these websites, the truthfulness of their actions and statements on
these websites may be suspect. Our results suggest that using data from these
sources may lead to faulty conclusions given our evidence that people will create
false impressions about themselves 10.
10

For example, an industry of firms has emerged that helps individuals create false beliefs by

employing “click farms” to create false Facebook “likes”, to create false Twitter followers, or to
create false LinkedIn “links”. For a small fee a firm or individual can purchase Facebook “likes”
or Twitter followers in order to create a false image of popularity or sphere of influence (VerSteeg
and Galstayan, 2011; Wilbur and Zhu, 2009). Since social image is a powerful motivator,
previous research has focused on using social media to influence behavior (encourage people to
quit smoking, lose weight, exercise more frequently, vote a certain way, etc.). However in light of

31

Our results do not rule out cooperative behavior arising from altruism or warmglow preferences. Since individuals can easily generate excuses to relieve
themselves from social obligations to give, this supports evidence that giving is
motivated by preferences for altruism and/or warm-glow. Further, people who
want to behave selfishly will do so and that mechanisms designed to apply social
pressure or guilt may do nothing to transform selfish behavior to cooperative
behavior. Instead, selfish individuals may end up lying in order to maintain the
appearance that they are cooperating with socially accepted group norms.

our findings, will individuals maintain their current “undesired” behavior and merely lie in order
to maintain their social image?
