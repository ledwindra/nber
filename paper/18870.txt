Measuring Uncertainty about Long-Run Prediction

JEL No. C22,C53,E17
ABSTRACT
Long-run forecasts of economic variables play an important role in policy, planning, and portfolio
decisions. We consider long-horizon forecasts of average growth of a scalar variable, assuming that
first differences are second-order stationary. The main contribution is the construction of predictive
sets with asymptotic coverage over a wide range of data generating processes, allowing for stochastically
trending mean growth, slow mean reversion and other types of long-run dependencies. We illustrate
the method by computing predictive sets for 10 to 75 year average growth rates of U.S. real per-capita
GDP, consumption, productivity, price level, stock prices and population.

Introduction

This paper is concerned with quantifying the uncertainty in long-run predictions of economic
variables. Long-run forecasts and the uncertainty surrounding them play an important role
in policy, planning, and portfolio decisions. For example, in the United States, an ongoing
task of the Congressional Budget Oﬃce (CBO) is to forecast productivity and real GDP
growth over a 75-year horizon to help gauge the solvency of the Social Security Trustfund.
Uncertainty surrounding these forecasts is then translated into the probability of trust fund
insolvency.1 Inflation “Caps” and “Floors” are option-like derivatives with payoﬀs tied to the
average value of price inflation over the next decade; their risk-neutral prices are determined
by the probability that the long-run average of future values of inflation falls above or below
a pre-specified threshold.2 And, there is a large literature in finance discussing optimal
portfolio allocations for long-run investors and how these portfolios depend on uncertainty
in long-run returns.3
To be specific, let  denote a time series, and suppose that data on  exists for time
P
periods  = 1   . Let  +1: + = −1 =1  + denote the average value of the series
between time periods  + 1 through  + . We are interested in the date  uncertainty
about the value of  +1: + , as characterized by prediction sets that contain  +1: + with
a pre-specified probability (such as 90%). We structure the problem so that the coverage
probability can be calculated using asymptotic approximations based on the central limit
theorem. In particular we suppose that both  and  are large, and construct the prediction
sets as a function of a relatively small number of weighted averages of the sample values of
 . We apply a central limit theorem to the variable of interest ( +1: + ) and the predictors, and study an asymptotic version of the prediction problem based on the multivariate
normal distribution. Were all the parameters of this normal distribution known (or consistently estimable), the prediction problem would be a straightforward application of optimal
prediction in the multivariate normal model.
The problem is complicated by unknown parameters that characterize the stochastic
process  and hence also the normal distribution in the large-sample problem. We assume
that the first diﬀerences ∆ =  −−1 are covariance stationary. Because we are interested
in a long-run prediction ( +1: + , for  large) the parameters that matter are those that
characterize the (pseudo-) spectrum of  near frequency zero. Because of the paucity of

information in the sample about these low-frequency parameters, uncertainty about their
values is an important component of the uncertainty about  +1: + . Much of the paper
is devoted to the problem incorporating uncertainty about these parameter values into the
construction of prediction sets for  +1: + . We begin by constructing a flexible parametric framework to characterize the long-run properties of the  process and then translate
uncertainty about the true parameter into uncertainty about  +1: + .
The low-frequency properties of  are parameterized by {  } where  describes the
long-run level of the process,  the long-run scale, and  the shape of the spectrum around
frequency zero. We show how uncertainty about  and  can be accounted for by considering
predictions sets that are scale and location invariant. To motivate our parameterization
of the local-to-zero frequency spectral shape, we consider three well-known models: the
fractionally integrated model, parameterized by  (where  = 0 denotes the (0) model and
 = 1 denotes the (1) model); the local-level model, which is the sum of independent (0)
and (1) processes and is parameterized by , which measures the relative importance of
the (1) process; and the diﬀusion (or local-to-unity AR) model parameterized by , which
measures the degree of mean reversion in the process. We construct a three parameter model,
 = (  )0 , which nests these models and provides additional flexibility to characterize the
low-frequency shape of the spectrum.
We use both Bayes and frequentist methods to construct prediction sets that reflect
uncertainty about . The Bayes procedure is conceptually straightforward: given a prior for
 and the Gaussianity of the limiting problem, the predictive density for  +1: + follows from
Bayes rule, so that prediction sets are readily computed. The frequentist procedure instead
constructs a prediction set that, by definition, controls coverage uniformly over all values
. We show how frequentist prediction sets with small expected volume can be constructed
using a “least favorable distribution” for . As constructed these frequentist prediction sets
have attractive properties over repeated samples from the same data generating process.
To also guarantee a sensible description of uncertainty conditional on any given sample, we
modify these frequentist sets using insights from Müller and Norets (2012).
The existing econometric literature mostly stresses the diﬃculty of constructing good
long-term forecasts under uncertainty about the long-run properties of the process. Granger
and Jeon (2007) provide a mostly verbal account. Elliott (2006) compares alternative approaches to point forecasts and compares their mean squared errors. Kemp (1999), Phillips
(1998) and Stock (1996, 1997) show that standard formulas for forecast uncertainty break
down in the long-horizon local-to-unity model, but they do not provide constructive alterna2

tives. In the related problem of estimating long-run impulse responses Pesavento and Rossi
(2006) construct confidence sets that account for uncertainty about the local-to-unity parameter. Chapter 8.7 in Beran (1994) discusses forecasting of fractionally integrated series, and
Doornik and Ooms (2004) use an ARFIMA model to generate long-run uncertainty bands
for future inflation, but without accounting for parameter estimation uncertainty. Pastor
and Stambaugh (2012) compute predictive variances of long-run forecasts of stock returns
that account for parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework. For a recent discussion of
long-run population forecasts and estimates of uncertainty see, for instance, Lee (2011). In
this context, Raftery, Li, Sevcíkova, Gerland, and Heilig (2012) employ a Bayesian approach
to describing uncertainty about future fertility rates.
To make better sense of the remainder of the paper, it is useful to consider the following simple “baseline” approach to constructing prediction sets: assume a pure fractional
Gaussian process with parameter −12    32 for  , that is,  =  +  with
(1 − )  =  for − 12    12
(1 − )−1 ∆ =  for 12    32, and 0 = 0
 ∼ N (0  2 )

(1)

and, after specifying some prior on the three parameters (  ), construct a predictive set
as the 1 −  highest posterior predictive density set for  +1: + . This simple approach
suﬀers from five drawbacks, which we address as follows. First, model (1) imposes an extremely tight restriction on the (pseudo) spectrum of  , with both low- and high-frequency
properties jointly governed by the single parameter . In Section 2, we discuss how to
extract the relevant low-frequency information about  using a small number of trigonometrically weighted averages. By making our predictions sets depend on  only through
these low-frequency transforms, we avoid having to model the higher frequency properties
of  . Second, one might question the choice of prior for the location and scale parameters
 and . This will be addressed by imposing appropriate invariance restrictions on the predictive sets, also discussed in Section 2. Third, the Gaussianity of the driving disturbances
 in (1) is a strong assumption. We address this issue by deriving a joint central limit
theorem for the low-frequency transforms of the observed data and  +1: + in Section 3. A
fourth concern about model (1) is the restrictive nature of its single parameter description
of low-frequency properties. This is addressed by the flexible three-parameter -model,
also developed in Section 3. A fifth and crucial concern about the baseline prediction sets
concerns their Bayes nature: the credible sets for  +1: + have coverage 1 −  by construction only if the parameters are drawn from the prior distribution. This issue is taken up in
3

Section 4, where we discuss frequentist prediction sets that achieve coverage uniformly over
the relevant parameter space. Section 5 discusses implementation details, and quantifies the
loss in prediction accuracy associated with using a small number of low-frequency weighted
averages as predictors. Finally, in Section 6 we apply the methods to construct long-run
prediction sets for several U.S. macroeconomic time series including real GDP, consumption,
productivity, population growth rates, price inflation and stock market returns. We conclude
in Section 7 with a short discussion of the small sample eﬀect of heteroskedasticity on the
coverage of the suggested prediction sets, as well as the challenges in extending the methods
to multiple time series.

The Prediction Problem

Let  be the growth rate of the economic variable of interest, which is observed for  =
1 · · ·   . The objective is to construct prediction sets, denoted by , of the average value
of  from periods  + 1 to  + ,
 +1: + = −1

with the property that  ( +1: + ∈ ) = 1 − , where  is a pre-specified constant.
(Predicting the average growth rate alternatively corresponds to predicting the future level
of the economic variable at time  + .)
Cosine transformations of the sample data. It will turn out to be convenient to
transform the sample data { }=1 into the weighted averages (1:   ), with  =
( (1)      ( − 1))0 , and where  () is the th cosine transformation

with Ψ () = 2 cos() and  = (2 ) sin(2 ) → 1. We make two remarks
about this transformation. First, because the Ψ weights add to zero,  () is invariant to
location shifts of the sample. Second, the transformation isolates variation in the sample
data corresponding to diﬀerent frequencies: 1: captures 0-frequency variation and  ()
captures variation at frequency  .
Truncating the information set. We will construct prediction sets based on a truncated
P
information set that includes 1: =  −1 =1  and the first  elements of  (denoted
4

by 1: ) and where  is much smaller than  − 1, so that  = (1:  1: ). We do this
for two reasons. The first is tractability: with a focus on this truncated information set, the
analysis involves a small number of variables (the ( + 2) variables ( +1: +  1:  1: )),
+
, a central limit derived
and because each of these variables is a weighted average of { }=1
in the next section allows us to study a limiting Gaussian version of the prediction problem
that is much simpler than the original finite-sample problem. The second motivation for
truncating the information set is robustness: we use the low-frequency information in the
sample data (1: and the first  elements of  ) to inform us about a low-frequency, longrun average of future data, but we do not use high frequency sample information (the last
 − 1 −  elements of  ). While high frequency information is informative about lowfrequency characteristics for some stochastic processes (for example, tightly parameterized
ARMA processes), this is generally not the case, and high-frequency sample variation may
lead to faulty low-frequency inference. Müller and Watson (2008, 2012) discuss this issue
in detail. In Section 5 below we present numerical calculations that quantify the eﬃciencyrobustness trade-oﬀ in the long-run prediction problem considered here.
Invariance. In our applications it is natural to restrict attention to prediction sets that
are invariant to location and scale, so for example, the results will not depend on whether
the data are expressed as growth rates in percentage points at an annual rate or as percent
per quarter. Thus, we restrict attention to prediction sets with the property that if  ∈
(1:  1: ) then  +  ∈ ( + 1:  1: ) for any constants  and  6= 0 (where
the transformation of 1: does not depend on  because 1: is location invariant).
Invariance allows us to restrict attention to prediction sets that depend on functions of the
sample data that are scale and location invariant; in particular we

Large-Sample Approximations and a Low-Frequency
Parameterization

The last section laid out the finite-sample prediction problem, and this section develops a
large-sample approximation to the problem. We do this in three steps. First, we discuss
conditions on the stochastic process  that yield a limiting normal distribution for appropriately scaled versions of (1:   ), and we show how the covariance matrix of this limiting
normal distribution depends on the low-frequency characteristics of the process  , specifically the shape of its spectrum near frequency zero. The second step is to parameterize
this covariance matrix in terms of the shape of this “local-to-zero spectrum”. We do so in a
way that three important benchmark models, the (), local level and local-to-unity models
emerge as special cases. In the final step we present the implied asymptotic distribution of
the maximal invariants  and  that define the prediction problem under location and
scale invariance.

3.1

Asymptotic Behavior of (1:   )

To derive the asymptotic behavior for (1:   ), note that each element can be written
 +
. Thus, let  : [0 1 + ] 7→ R denote a
as a weighted average of the elements of { }=1
generic weighting function, where  = lim →∞ ( )  0, and consider the weighted average
+
of { }=1

where  is a suitably chosen constant.5 In our context, the elements of 1: are cosine
√
transformations of the in-sample values of  , so that () = 2 cos() for 0 ≤  ≤ 1 and
() = 0 for   1;  is the diﬀerence between the out-of-sample and in-sample average
values of  , so that () = −1 for 0 ≤  ≤ 1 and () = −1 for 1   ≤ 1 + . These
weights sum to zero, so that the (unconditional) expectation of  plays no role in the study
of   .
In the appendix we provide a central limit theorem for   under a set of primitive
conditions about the stochastic process describing  and these weighting functions. We
will not list the technical conditions in the text, but rather give a brief overview of the

key conditions before stating the limiting result and discussing the form of the limiting
covariance matrix. In particular, the analysis is carried out under the assumption that ∆
has the moving average representation ∆ = () , where  is a possibly conditionally
heteroskedastic martingale diﬀerence sequence with more than 2 unconditional moments.
(The implied ∆ = 0 rules out a linear time trend in  ; this doesn’t seem too restrictive,
given that  models a growth rate.) The moving average coeﬃcients in () are square
summable, so that ∆ has a spectrum, denoted by  ().6 Let () =  ()|1 − − |2
denote the spectrum of  if it exists and the pseudo-spectrum otherwise.
Under these and additional technical assumptions, Theorem 1 in the appendix shows
that   has a limiting normal distribution, and as an implication

3.2

The Local-to-Zero Spectrum

The appendix derives Σ and shows that it depends exclusively on the low-frequency properties of  . To see why, consider a special case of our analysis in which  is stationary
with spectrum (). The ’th element of Σ is the limiting covariance of the two weighted
averages   and  , where

is the ‘local-to-zero spectrum’ of  . The appendix shows that covariance stationarity of  is
not required for (5) to hold as long as ∆ is covariance stationary, in which case  becomes
the local-to-zero limit of the pseudo-spectrum  of  .
The limit (5) shows that the elements of the covariance matrix of (1:   )0 are simply
weighted averages of the local-to-zero spectrum . Note that since  is an even function and

independent of the local-to-zero spectrum . Figure 1 plots  (·) for some selected values
of  and  and  = 12. The figure displays the weights  corresponding to the covariance
matrix of the vector (1  2  3  10  11  12   )0 , organized into a symmetric matrix of 9
panels. The first panel plots the weights for the covariance matrix of (1  2  3 )0 , where the
weights for the variances are shown in bold and the weights for the covariances are shown
as thin curves. The second panel plots the weights associated with covariances between
(1  2  3 )0 and (10  11  12 )0 , and so forth. A calculation shows that covariance weights
 ,  6= , integrate to zero, which implies that for a flat local-to-zero spectrum , Σ is
diagonal. As can be seen from the first and second panel on the diagonal of Figure 1, the
variance of the predictor  is mostly determined by the values of  in the interval  ± 2.
Further, as long as  is somewhat smooth, the correlation between  and  is very close
to zero for | − | large. The final panel in the figure shows the weight associated with the
variance of  , the variable being predicted. Evidently the unconditional variance of  is
mostly determined by the shape of  on the interval  ∈ [0 4], and its correlation with 
is therefore small for  large even for smooth but non-constant  (a calculation shows that
max |+1 ()| decays at the rate 1 as  → ∞). The implication of these results is that
the conditional variance of  given 1: depends on the local-to-zero spectrum, with the
shape of  for, say,   12, essentially determining its value, even for large . In terms of
the original time series, frequencies of ||  12 correspond to cycles of periodicity  6. For
8

9

instance, with 60 years worth of data (of any sampling frequency), the shape of the spectrum
for frequencies below 10 year cycles essentially determines the uncertainty of the forecast of
mean growth over the next 30 years.
Since the local-to-zero spectrum  determines Σ, the salient feature of the stochastic
process  for long-run forecasts is the shape of the local-to-zero spectrum (the unconditional
mean of  , as well as the absolute scale of the local-to-zero spectrum of  are irrelevant under
the invariance requirement discussed in Section 2). To motivate our parameterization of ,
it is useful to consider three benchmark models that have been proven useful to model lowfrequency phenomena in other contexts: the fractional () model,7 the local-level model,8
and the local-to-unity model.9 The () model has a (pseudo-) spectrum proportional to
||−2 for  close to zero, so that () ∝ ||−2 , −12    32. In particular  is
constant for the (0) model and is proportional to  −2 for the (1) model. The locallevel model expresses  as the sum of an (0) process and an (1) process, say  = 1 +
P
( ) =1 2 , where {1 } and {2 } are mutually uncorrelated (0) processes with the same
long-run variance. The second component of relative magnitude  is usefully thought of as
a stochastically varying ‘local mean’ of the growth rate  . In this model, () ∝ 1 + 2 2 .
Finally, in the local-to-unity model  = (1 −  )−1 +  , where  is an (0) process, and
a straightforward calculation shows that () ∝ 1( 2 + 2 ). (Note that ( ) → (0 ∞)
and ( ) → (∞ 0) recover the (0) and (1) model, respectively). These three models are
nested in the parameterization
() ∝

1
+ 2
+ 2

||2

(6)

where  =  = 0 for the () model,  = 1,  = 0, and  = −2 for the local-level model, and
 = 1,  = , and  = 0 for the local-to-unity model.
In the construction of our prediction sets, we assume  to follow this “-model”, with
−12    32 and  and  unrestricted. This parameterization allows us to capture a wide
range of monotone shapes for the low frequency (pseudo-) spectrum of  , including, but not

approaches for constructing prediction sets for   as functions of   . We consider a standard
formulation of the problem (Pratt (1961)), namely, construction of a set (  ) that has
smallest expected volume subject to a coverage constraint
min (vol((  ))) subject to  (  ∈ (  )) ≥ 1 − 


where vol() denotes the volume of the set . The Bayes and frequentist versions of the
problems use diﬀerent distributions to compute the expected value in the objective function
and coverage probability in the constraint and therefore yield diﬀerent solutions to the
problem.
To discuss these solutions and how they diﬀer, it is useful to introduce some generic
notation: let  denote a random variable with probability density  (·|) that depends on
 let Ω denote a probability distribution for , and let
Z
Ω
 () =  (|)Ω()
so that Ω is the density of  if  is first drawn randomly from Ω.

Bayes Sets

In the Bayes version of the problem, the predictive density of   given   =  is used to
compute both the value of the objective function, (vol((  ))) and the coverage constraint,
 (  ∈ (  )) ≥ 1 − . The resulting predictive set is characterized by the “highest
predictive density” set

on  because the constraint is evaluated using the predictive density evaluated at   =  ).
An important special case is Bayes forecasting in the (0) model (that is, Γ puts all
weight on the (0) model). Recall from Section 3 that in the (0) model,   is independent
of   , and  12 (1 + −1 )−12   is distributed Student-t with  degrees of freedom. Letting
(1−2) denote the 1 − 2 quantile of this distribution, the (1 − ) Bayes prediction set
for   is therefore {  : |  | ≤ (1−2)  −12 (1 + −1 )12 }, which does not depend on  .

4.2

Frequentist Sets

While the Bayes set enforces the coverage constraint conditional on each   , it averages
over possible values of  using the prior Γ. In contrast, the frequentist set enforces the coverage constraint for all values of , but averages over possible values of   . The problem of
constructing optimal frequentist prediction sets is analogous to the problem of constructing
optimal frequentist confidence sets, which in turn is closely related to the problem of constructing most powerful tests (Pratt (1961)). It is therefore useful to review the problem
of constructing most powerful tests, as we employ analogous methods to construct optimal
prediction sets.
In the testing problem,  corresponds to a vector of parameters that characterize the
distribution of the observables under the null hypothesis 0 :  ∈ Θ0 and alternative hypothesis 1 :  ∈ Θ1 . Two devices are often used to handle composite null and alternative
hypotheses. Under the alternative, the power of the test depends on the value of , and
tests are usefully evaluated by their weighted average power (WAP), where the weights load
on diﬀerent values of . Thus, let Γ : Θ1 7→ R denote the weight function used to compute
WAPΓ where the dependence on Γ is made explicit. (While we have used the same notation
Γ for this weight function as for the prior in the Bayes problem, these represent conceptually
diﬀerent distributions.) For a level  test, the test’s rejection frequency must be less than 
uniformly over all values of  ∈ Θ0 . This uniform size constraint can sometimes be enforced
by assuming that  is drawn from a “least favorable distribution,” say Λ, on Θ0 . When
this is the case, the Neyman-Pearson lemma implies that the optimal (that is, the highest
WAPΓ ) test can be constructed from the likelihood ratio, where the likelihood under the
null is computed using Λ and the likelihood under the alternative is computed using Γ. Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2012) discuss numerical methods for computing an approximate
least favorable distribution Λ̃, which yields a value of WAPΓ that is approximately equal its
highest achievable value.
The prediction set analogue for these testing results is as follows. The objective function
changes from maximizing power to minimizing expected volume, and because the distribution
of (     ) depends on , the expected volume depends on . Let WAVΓ denote the weighted
average expected volume using the weight function Γ. The level constraint in the testing
problem changes to the coverage constraint in the prediction set problem, and this is enforced
uniformly over all values of . Like the testing problem, this can sometimes be achieved using
a least favorable distribution for , and we therefore apply numerical procedures like those
proposed in Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2012) to construct an approximate least favorable
14

distribution for , Λ̃, that guarantees uniform coverage. This allows us to construct an
approximate optimal frequentist prediction set as the solution to the problem of minimizing
WAVΓ subject to Λ̃ (  ∈ (  )) ≥ 1−, where Λ̃ means that the probability is computed
by first drawing  from Λ̃, and then (     ) conditional on that value of . The resulting
optimal prediction set is

(Additional details are provided in the appendix.)
As a practical matter, the frequentist prediction set diﬀers from the Bayes set in two ways.
First, the Bayes set uses the same distribution of  (the prior Γ) to evaluate the marginal
densities of   and (     ), while the frequentist set uses diﬀerent distributions (Γ is used
for the density of   because this term arises from the expected volume calculation, and
Λ̃ is used for (     ) because this term arises from the coverage constraint). Second, the
Bayes set uses a critical value that depends on  (which enforces the coverage constraint
conditional on   =  ), while the frequentist set uses a fixed critical value (which enforces
the coverage constraint averaging over all values of   under Λ̃ ).
In the (0) model,  is fixed, so the prior and weighting functions Γ and Λ̃ are absent. In
addition, the Bayes critical value does not depend on  (because   and   are independent). Thus, in the (0) model, the Bayes and frequentist prediction sets are identical.

4.3

Bet-proof Frequentist Prediction Sets

On average, frequentist prediction sets (10) have attractive properties: they cover   with

a prespecified probability for all possible values of , inf ∈Θ  (  ∈ freq
Γ ( )) ≥ 1 − , and
they are as short as possible in a well defined sense. Conditional on a specific draw of   =  ,
however, they do not necessarily provide a compelling description of uncertainty about   .
To see this, consider the special case where  = 0 is known (so that Γ and Λ̃ in (9) and (10)
put all mass at  = 0 ), but the conditional density of   given   =  depends on   In
our context, this would arise, for instance, if the  process is known to be (1). A reasonable
description of level 1− uncertainty about   after observing   =  then arguably requires
that the set covers (at least) 1 −  of the mass of the conditional density of   given  =  .
in (9) does so by choosing the shortest such set. In contrast, since cv

Γ ( ) might even by empty for some  =  . While this makes sense in the context
of the frequentist problem–an empty set has no volume leading to a small value of the
objective function, and coverage can be enforced by averaging over other values of   –it
does not yield a reasonable measure of uncertainty about   after observing   =  .
Müller and Norets (2012) take up this issue in the context of frequentist confidence intervals. They consider a game where an inspector may bet that the realized confidence interval
does not contain the true value, with a payoﬀ that corresponds to the odds implied by the
confidence level. Müller and Norets (2012) call a confidence set “bet-proof” if it is impossible for the inspector to generate positive expected winnings uniformly over the parameter
space. It is easy to see that confidence sets that are empty with positive probability for all
parameter values cannot be bet-proof, as the inspector could bet against empty realizations,
and always be right. More generally, bet-proofness rules out descriptions of uncertainty that
do not make sense conditionally, such as in the known parameter example above: whenever



 freq
0 (  ∈ freq
Γ ( )| =  )  1 − , the inspector bets that  ∈
Γ ( ), which yields
positive expected winnings.
It turns out that any bet-proof confidence or prediction set is necessarily a superset of
a Bayes set of the same level, relative to some prior. One way of constructing attractive
bet-proof frequentist sets suggested by Müller and Norets (2012) is thus to exogenously fix
some prior Γ, and to then derive a Γ-weighted average expected volume minimizing set,
subject to inclusion of a Bayes set relative to Γ, and the coverage constraint. We apply this
suggestion here, with the Bayes set chosen as the equal-tailed 1− Bayes predictive interval.
This choice is numerically more convenient than the highest predictive density set (9), and
it induces bet-proofness in the extended game where the inspector may bet that   will be
below (or above) the reported interval at odds corresponding to 2, as discussed by Müller
and Norets (2012).
The numerical determination of such a bet-proof Γ-weighted average volume minimizing
set is not much harder than what is described in Section 4.2 above, as the solution (10) is
“realization by realization”, and the additional constraint of the inclusion of the Bayes set
in (10) to be a superset of the equal-tailed Bayes predictive set. The

Empirical Implementation

In this section, we bring together the results of the previous sections and discuss our choices
for the weighting function Γ and the number of predictors  in the suggested empirical
implementation.
In our context, the parameter space consists of the possible values of  = (  )0 , the
parameter that describes the local-to-zero spectrum  introduced in Section 3 above. We
and
specify −04 ≤  ≤ 14, and leave  and  unrestricted. The implementation of Bayes
Γ
requires the choice of a prior/weight function Γ on this parameter space. We choose

Γ
Γ so that it puts all mass on models with  =  = 0, and with a uniform distribution on
 ∈ [−04 14]. Thus, we eﬀectively construct the prediction sets that are, on average, as
short as possible in the fractional model, and with guaranteed frequentist coverage in the
unconstrained -model. The uniform weighting over  ∈ [−04 14] makes the prediction
sets informative over the whole range of anti-persistent (  0) to very persistent ( ≥ 1)
processes .
As discussed in Section 2, the choice of  may usefully thought of as a trade-oﬀ between
eﬃciency and robustness. In principle, the central limit theorem for (0 1:   )0 discussed in
Section 3 and presented in the appendix holds for any fixed , at least asymptotically. And
the larger , the smaller the (average) uncertainty about  . This suggests that one should
pick  large to increase eﬃciency of the procedure.
At the same time, one might worry that approximations provided by the central limit
theorem for (0 1:   )0 become poor for large . The concern is not only that the highdimensional multivariate Gaussianity might fail to be an accurate approximation; more
importantly, any parametric assumption about the shape of the local-to-zero spectrum be17

comes stronger for larger . In particular, for a given sample size  , the assumption that
the spectrum of  over the frequencies [−  ] is well approximated by the spectrum
of the -model becomes less plausible the larger .
We are thus faced with a classic eﬃciency and robustness trade-oﬀ. Recall from the discussion of Figure 1 in Section 3, however, that the object of interest–the variability of longrun forecasts, as embodied by the conditional variance of  given 1: –is a low frequency
quantity that is essentially governed by properties of  over frequencies [−12 12 ].
Since the predictors  () provide information for frequency  , this suggests that the
marginal benefit of increasing  beyond  = 12 is modest, at least with the spectrum known.
With the spectrum unknown, 1: with larger  provides additional information about
its scale and its shape. The scale eﬀect is most easily understood in the (0) model. As
discussed above, the (0) prediction set is 1: ± (1−2) (1 + −1 )12  −12  , where 2 =

is a decreasing function of .11 But the benefit of increasing  is modest: for a 90% interval,
the average length for  ∈ {24 48 ∞} is only {300% 442% 577%} shorter than for  = 12,
for instance.
When the shape of the spectrum is unknown but parametrized, as in the -model,
increasing  beyond 12 provides additional information about the shape of the spectrum
over the crucial frequencies [−12 12 ]. Table 1 quantifies the combined scale and

1:12
shape eﬀect by reporting the Γ-average of the expected length of forecasts of   1:12
based on observations 1: for  ∈ {12 24 48}. As a point of comparison, it also reports
this average length for  known, where reductions for larger  are solely driven by the scale
eﬀect.12 From panel (a), for  = 040, there is an 8% decrease in average length as  increases
from  = 12 to  = 24 and a further reduction of 5% for  = 48, where (from panel (b))
approximately one-fourth of the decrease comes from the unknown scale eﬀect. Much of
our empirical analysis uses 65 years of post-WWII data, so that a choice  = 12 relies on
periodicities below 108 years, while  = 24 and  = 48 use periodicities below 54 and
27 years. The marginal benefit of increasing  beyond  = 12 is modest, and  must be
11

This is perfectly analogous to the wider confidence intervals that arise from the use of inconsistent HAC
estimators; see Kiefer, Vogelsang, and Bunzel (2000) and Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002, 2005), and Müller
(2012) for a review.
12
These are for comparison only; the parameter of the -model cannot be consistently estimated even
as  → ∞.

chosen very much larger to substantially reduce forecast uncertainty overall. In our view, a
concern about substantial spectral misspecification outweighs these potential gains, so that
as a default, we suggest constructing the predictive sets with  = 12.

Prediction Sets for U.S. Macroeconomic Time Series

In this section we present prediction sets for eight U.S. economic time series for forecast
horizons ranging from 10 to 75 years. These series include growth rates of per-capita values
of real GDP and consumption, population, productivity, prices (as measured by the CPI
and PCE deflator), and real stock returns. We construct prediction sets using post-WWII
quarterly samples, and for several series, samples that extend into the early 20th century. We
also examine prediction sets for inflation in Japan as a contrast to results for U.S. inflation.
Sources and details of construction of the data are presented in the Data Appendix.
Prediction sets are constructed using the low-frequency transformations of the series with
a benchmark value of  = 12, although we also investigate the robustness of these sets to
larger and smaller values of . We begin by discussing forecast intervals that arise in the
(0) model, then turn to the empirical evidence for and impact of alternative () models,
and finally present the Bayes and frequentist sets for the -model discussed in Sections 4
and 5.

with its low-frequency component extracted by 1:12 , that is the series’ projection on

is an estimate of the long-run variance, and  =  is forecast horizon expressed as a
fraction of the sample size. For example, from the first row of the table, the growth rate of
real per-capita GDP averaged 19% (at an annual rate) over the 1947:Q2-2012:Q2 sample
period, with an estimated long-run standard deviation of  = 51%. Over the next 25
years per-capita GDP is forecast to grow at an average rate between 15% and 23% with
probability 50%; that is the 50% prediction set is (15 23). The 80% and 90% prediction
sets are wider, (11 27) and (08 30), respectively.
While the (0) prediction sets for real GDP are plausible, the prediction sets for inflation
seem implausible. In the U.S., CPI inflation averaged 36% over the sample period with a
long-run standard deviation of 104%. This yields a 25-year ahead 50% prediction set of
(28 45). This suggests that over the next 25 years the U.S. will experience significantly
higher average values of inflation than those experienced over the past decade and well
above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target. Even more problematic is the 50% prediction
interval for Japanese inflation of (19 45), a range comfortably above the very low levels of
inflation that Japan has experienced over the past two decades. One problem with these (0)
prediction sets is that they are centered around the in-sample means for for inflation (36%
for U.S. CPI inflation and 32% for Japanese inflation). However, inflation is very persistent
(Figure A.1, panels g and h), so that this centering is problematic. The remaining tables
and figures study the persistence properties of the various time series and present prediction
sets for processes that are more general than the (0) model.
Table 3 summarizes the persistence properties of the time series in terms of the value of
 in the () model. It shows the log-likelihood values for various values of , where the log
and its asymptotic distribution (7), and the log-likelihood of the
likelihood is based on 1:12
(0) model is normalized to zero. The post-WWII U.S. inflation data yields log-likelihoods
with maxima around  = 06 with corresponding log-likelihood values that are between 19
and 29 times larger than the (0) model. The log-likelihood values for inflation suggests two
conclusions: first, inflation is more persistent than the (0) model (so that the (0) prediction
intervals in Table 2 are likely to be invalid), and second, there is considerable uncertainty
21

22

about the exact degree of persistence. For example, the MLE of  is approximately b ≈
07 for post-war U.S. PCE inflation, but values of  ranging from  = 03 to  = 11 reduce
the log-likelihood by less than 1. This reflects the limited long-run information in a the
65-year sample. Looking at post-WWII real per-capita GDP suggests that persistence is
not large for this series (values of   06 yield a log-likelihood 3 points lower than the (0)
model), but values of  ranging from −04 (suggesting some reversion to a linear trend in
the level of GDP, so that the growth rate is overdiﬀerenced) to 02 (slight persistence in the
GDP growth rates) all fit the data reasonably well.
Figure 3 shows how uncertainty about  translates into prediction uncertainty. It shows
25-year ahead predictive densities constructed using four diﬀerent values of  for four of the
series listed in Table 2. Panel (a) shows results for real per-capita GDP, and the predictive
densities are shown for  = −04, 00, 02 and 05, a plausible range of values from Table
2. As  increases, the variance of the predictive density increases (because more persistence
leads to larger variability in future average growth) and the mode of the density shifts to
the left (reflecting the persistent eﬀect of the slow growth experienced at the end of sample).
Also plotted in the figure is the Bayes predictive density constructed using a flat prior on
−04 ≤  ≤ 14. For real GDP, because (from Table 2) negative values of  fit the data
somewhat better than the (0) model, the Bayes predictive density is shifted to the right
of the (0) density, reflecting low-frequency anti-persistence in the forecast period following
a decade of lower-than average growth at the end of the sample. Table 2 suggests that
total factor productivity may be somewhat more persistent than the (0) model and this is
reflected in panel (b) of Figure 3 in a Bayes predictive density that is more disperse than the
(0) density; the Bayes density is very close to the density computed using  = 04. Panel
(c) shows results for CPI inflation, where the Bayes density is much more disperse than the
(0) model, but much less disperse than the (1) model. Finally, panel (d) of Figure 3 shows
results for post-WWII real stock returns. From Table 2, real returns may be somewhat more
persistent than an (0) process, and thus the Bayes predictive density in Figure 3 is more
disperse than the (0) density.
Table 4 and Figure A.2 show prediction sets for other horizons. These show Bayes
prediction sets constructed using the () model with flat prior for  ∈ [−04 14] together
frequentist prediction sets that have guaranteed coverage in the -model, as
with 

discussed in Section 6. Figure A.2 plots prediction sets for horizons ranging from 10 to 75
years, and Table 4 shows the sets for four forecast horizons, 10, 25, 50, and 75 years. The
prediction sets were computed separately for each horizon, so coverage is pointwise in the
23

forecast horizon. In Figure A.2 the boundary of the Bayes sets are plotted as solid curves
and the frequentist sets as dashed curves. In many cases the sets coincide, so that only
one curve is visible in the plot. In Table 4 the Bayes sets are shown in parentheses, the
corresponding frequentist set is shown in brackets when it diﬀers from the Bayes set.
We now discuss the results for specific series in more detail.
Real per capita GDP. The Bayes predictive sets for per-capita GDP narrow as the forecast horizon increases, consistent with the reduction in variance of the sample mean for an
(0) process. At the 75-year horizon the 80% Bayes prediction interval is 14 to 25, which
coincides with the interval reported by the Congressional Budget Oﬃce (2005) for 75-year
forecasts beginning in 2004. The coincidence of the Bayes/CBO sets arises despite important diﬀerences in the way they are computed. The CBO interval is based on simulations
computed from an estimated VAR model which (for large  ) corresponds to constructing
an interval using an (0) model ignoring parameter uncertainty and using a long-run standard deviation computed from the VAR. This interval diﬀers from the Bayes interval in two
important respects. First, because the VAR simulations are carried out using fixed values
of the VAR parameters, the CBO method ignores the parameter uncertainty in 1: (as
an estimate of ) and 2 (as a an estimate of the long-run variance). Ignoring this uncertainty leads the CBO interval to underestimate uncertainty in the predictions. Second,
the CBO method models GDP growth as an (0) process, while the Bayes method allows
values of  that diﬀer from  = 0. The results in Table 3 and Figure 3 suggest that GDP
growth is plausibly characterized by a process with some low-frequency anti-persistence, and
this translates into less forecast uncertainty than the CBO’s (0) model. Thus, the CBO
method tends to understate forecast uncertainty because it ignores parameter uncertainty
in the estimated mean and long-run variance, and to overstate forecast uncertainty because
a (short-lag) VAR cannot capture long-run anti-persistence associated with negative values
of . Apparently these two errors cancel, so that the CBO prediction interval coincides with
the Bayes set.
The frequentist set coincides with the Bayes set for 50% coverage and for (relatively) short
horizons for higher coverage. However, at longer horizons the 80% and 90% frequentist sets
diﬀer from Bayes sets and include smaller values of average GDP growth rates. Apparently,
to guarantee high coverage uniformly in the -model at long horizons, the frequentist sets
allow for the possibility of more persistence in the GDP process, so that the slow-growth
rates of the past decade are predicted to potentially persist into the future. A comparison of
the prediction sets constructed using the post-WWII data and the long-annual (1901-2011)
28

series shows that the pre-WWII data tend to widen the predictions sets, presumably because
of the higher (long-run) variance in the pre-WWII data evident in Figure A.1.
Productivity. Table 2 indicates that productivity (TFP and average labor productivity)
may have somewhat greater than (0) persistence. This translates into prediction sets that
are wider than (0) sets (see Figure 3 for a comparison of (0) and Bayes predictive densities
for TFP), particularly for frequentist sets at large forecast horizons. Figure A.2 shows that
the Bayes intervals are essentially flat as the forecast horizon increases (unlike in an (0)
model, where the intervals narrow), while the frequentist sets widen (the unmodified Bayes
intervals systematically undercover for larger values of , forcing the frequentist intervals to
more heavily weigh the possibility of larger ).
Population. Figure A.1 shows considerable low-frequency variability in U.S. population
growth over the 20th century and the post-WWII period.13 Immigration and fertility dynamics are presumably at the source of these long swings. Table 3 indicates that b is
very close to unity over both sample periods, with the (1) likelihood more than 7-log points
higher than in the (0) model. Figure A.2 shows prediction intervals that widen as the
forecast horizon increases, a familiar characteristic of (1) predictive densities. Frequentist
and Bayes prediction sets are similar, as the Bayes sets already put suﬃciently large weight
on large values of . There is little diﬀerence in the sets constructed using the post-WWII
samples and long-samples.
Inflation. As discussed above, the inflation process is characterized by more than (0)
persistence, and this is reflected in the prediction sets in two ways. First, they are not
centered at the sample mean of the series, but rather at a level dictated by the values near
the end of sample period, and second, the prediction sets widen with the forecast horizon.
The prediction intervals indicate considerable uncertainty in inflation even at relatively short
horizons; this is true for Bayes and frequentist sets (which essentially coincide). For example,
while the 10-year 50% predictive set for U.S. CPI inflation is (13 42), the 80% set widens
to (−01 56), and the 90% set widens further to (−11 65).
These predictions sets may strike some readers as too large, but it is instructive to consider the history of Japan where the 10-year moving average of CPI inflation was less than
zero from 2003 through the end of the sample. Moreover, they are in line with predictive
densities derived from asset prices. For example, Kitsul and Wright (2012) use CPI-based
13

The quaterly post-WWII population series is not seasonally adjusted and shows substantial seasonal
variation. Because we focus on low-frequency transformations of the series, this seasonality does not aﬀect
the empirical results.

29

derivatives to compute market-based risk-neutral predictive densities for 10-year ahead average values of inflation. They find deflation (average inflation less than 0%) probabilities that
averaged approximately 15% over 2011 and “high inflation" (average inflation greater than
4%) of 30%.14 The corresponding probabilities computed from the Bayes predictive density
constructed using the post-WWII data are 11% for deflation and 28% for high inflation.
Stock Returns. Table 3 indicates that post-WWII real stock returns exhibit slightly more
persistence than is implied by the (0) model, and this translates into prediction sets are that
are wider than implied by the (0) model. For example, at the 25-year horizon, the (0)
80% prediction set (from Table 2) is (19 115) while the corresponding Bayes prediction
set (from Table 4) is (−09 127) and the frequentist set is wider still (−11 127). The
longer-span data suggest somewhat less persistence (b = 00 for the 1926-2001 sample)
yielding Bayes and frequentist prediction intervals that are somewhat narrower than those
constructed using the post-WWII data.
Pastor and Stambaugh (2012) survey the large literature on long-run stock return volatility and construct Bayes predictive densities using models that allow for potentially persistent
components in returns and incorporate parameter uncertainty. While their results rely on
more parametric models than ours–they use all frequencies and exact Gaussian likelihoods–
our empirical conclusions are similar. Using our notation, Pastor and Stambaugh (2012) are
√
concerned with the behavior of variance of ̄ +1: + and how this variance changes with
√
the forecast horizon . If the variance of ̄ +1: + is unchanged as  increases, and if the
predictive density is Gaussian, then the width of prediction intervals for ̄ +1: + will be
√
proportional to −12 . Pastor and Stambaugh find that the variance of ̄ +1: + is not
constant, but rather increases with . In our results,the Bayes predictive sets narrow as 
increases as  increases, but more slowly than −12 , consistent with the Pastor-Stambaugh
findings.
Results for diﬀerent values of q. As discussed in Sections 3 and 5, the choice of  =
12 involved an eﬃciency/robustness trade-oﬀ, where a larger value of  results in more
information about the scale and shape parameter, but potential misspecification because the
higher-frequency spectrum may not be well-described by the same model and parameter. It
is therefore interesting to see how the prediction sets vary with , and this is reported in Table
5, which shows the 80% prediction sets for the 25-year ahead forecasts for  = 6 9 12 24 and
48. Looking across all of the entries, the prediction sets behave roughly as expected, in the
sense that they remain centered at roughly the same value but tend to narrow as  increases.
14

See Kitsul and Wright (2012), Figures 3 and 4.

30

31

For example, averaging across the 14 series, the  = 48 prediction set is 2% narrower than
the  = 12 prediction set. There are two noteworthy exceptions. First, both per-capita GDP
and consumption (quarterly post-WWII) show a lower bound for the  = 6 prediction sets
that is more than one percentage point lower than the corresponding value for the  = 12
sets. This arises because the  = 6 log-likelihood functions for  are much flatter than the
 = 12 functions summarized in Table 3. Thus, when  = 6, the prediction sets account for
the possibility of more persistence in the series and this includes an extrapolation of the lowgrowth levels experienced by the U.S. economy over the past decade. The second exception
is quarterly U.S. inflation. Here the lower bounds of the  = 24 and  = 48 prediction
sets are more than one percentage point higher than for  = 12. This arises because the
 = 24 48 likelihood values suggest less persistence than  = 12 value. (When  = 24 48 the
likelihood peaks at values of  around 04 while the peak is around  = 07 for  = 12.)

7

Additional Remarks

We conclude by discussing two issues. First, we analyze the robustness of our prediction sets
relative to data generating processes with pronounced second moment variability, and then
we briefly discuss the challenges of extending our framework to a multivariate setting.

7.1

Heteroskedasticity

The large-sample results presented in Section 3 allow for processes with conditional heteroskedasticity that may be persistent, but that eventually vanishes in the sense of assumption (i) of Theorem 1 in the Appendix. That said, these large-sample results may provide
poor approximations in samples of the size considered in the last section (65 years of quarterly data) for series with persistent changes in second moments. We investigate this in this
subsection with a simulation experiment focusing on the (0) model, which approximately
describes stock returns, and the local-level model, which approximately describes the U.S.
inflation rate. The (0) model with stochastic volatility has the form
 =  

(12)

ln( 2 ) = (1 − ) +  ln( 2−1 ) + 

(13)

where
and where { } and { } are independent with  ∼ N (0 1) and  ∼ N (0 2 ). For the
simulations we calibrate  2 using the quarterly post-war stock returns from Section 6, the
32

value of  does not matter because of scale invariance, and we investigate coverage for several
values of , keeping the unconditional variance of ln( 2 ) fixed at the sample analogue. The
local-level model with stochastic volatility has the form
 = 1 + 

−1


X

  2

=1

where ln(  ) follows the AR(1) process in (13) and where {1 } and {2 } are mutually
independent and independent of { } and distributed  ∼ (0  2 ),  = 1 2. In this
local-level model, stochastic volatility is present in the (1) component but not in the (0)
component, consistent with the evidence for U.S. inflation provided in Stock and Watson
(2007). The values of   , , , and   are calibrated using the estimated inflation stochastic
volatility estimated for CPI inflation from Stock and Watson (2010), and simulations are
carried out for several values of  (again keeping the unconditional variance of ln( 2 ) fixed
at a sample estimate). In the simulations we set  = 240 to correspond with our post-WWII
empirical analysis.
The results are shown in Table 6. Each row of the table corresponds to a diﬀerent forecast
horizon, , and the various columns correspond to diﬀerent values of  over four sets of experiments. In the first experiment  = 0, so volatility is white noise, resulting in non-normal
i.i.d. disturbances. Coverage rates for 90% Bayes and MN-frequentist prediction sets are
shown in the second column of the table. The Bayes prediction sets tend to over-cover in
the (0) model and under-cover in the local-level model. (Recall that the Bayes sets have
asymptotic 90% coverage by construction in the () model when  ∼ [−04 14]). In
contrast, the MN-frequentist sets over-cover in the (0) model when  is large, but have
coverage of nearly 90% in the local-level model. (Recall that the MN-frequentist have asymptotic coverage of at least 90% by construction for −04 ≤  ≤ 14 and all values of 
and .) The next three columns of the table show coverage rates for  = (075 090 099).
Relative to coverage rates for  = 0 there is little change in the (0) model for either the
Bayes or MN-frequentist prediction sets. In the local-level model the largest diﬀerence is 4%,
which occurs with  = 099 and  = 140. Thus, even highly persistent stochastic volatility
has only a small eﬀect on coverage in these experiments.
A possible explanation for this robustness is that these results hold "on average" over
the realizations of the volatility process, but that coverage may diﬀer considerably over insample realizations of ln(2 ). That is, one might conjecture that when ln( 2 ) is smaller
than the unconditional volatility coverage exceeds 90%, but when ln( 2 ) is larger than the
unconditional volatility coverage is less than 90%. Thus the other columns of the table
33

34

investigate the sensitivity of coverage to the realized value of ln( 2 ). Columns 5-10 show
coverage rates conditional on ln( ) being one standard deviation above or below its unconditional value. While these conditional coverage rates diﬀer from the unconditional rates as
expected, the eﬀects are relatively small. For example, the conditional coverage rates for the
MN-frequentist sets diﬀer from the unconditional rates by 6% in the local-level for short run
predictions ( = 005) and persistent stochastic volatility ( = 099), but these diﬀerences
fall to 2% as the forecast increases to  = 14.

7.2

Multivariate Prediction Sets

In a number of contexts it would be desirable to extend the analysis to a multivariate framework, where several time series are modelled and forecast jointly. One motivation would be
that allowing for the richer information set from several variables might increase forecast
accuracy. Another, perhaps even more compelling motivation is an interest in studying the
joint uncertainty of long-run forecasts of several variables. For instance, one might want to
forecast several components of GDP growth jointly (such as population growth, employment
growth and productivity growth), and then use them for ‘uncertainty accounting’ purposes,
that is to identify the major contributors to overall long-run GDP growth uncertainty.15
Another application would be the joint uncertainty about long-run stock returns and consumption, which features prominently in asset pricing models that focus on long-run risk
(Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2008)).
Conceptually, it is fairly straightforward to extend our framework to the multivariate
setting. With   ̄1: and 1: now 1 ×  and  ×  matrices, with each column representing the transformations of Section 2 for one series, one would expect that under suitable
conditions, the analogue of the central limit theorem presented in the appendix to hold, so
that

where the elements of Σ are functions of some  dimensional local-to-zero spectrum. Location
and scale invariance then corresponds to the requirement that if  ∈ (1:  1: ), then also
 +  ∈ ( + 1:  1: ), for any  ∈ R and full rank  ×  matrix . It is not hard
to see that under this invariance, one can restrict attention to the problem of forecasting

growth.

matrix 1: . Thus, with some parametric assumption on the shape of the spectral density,
one could in principle proceed as in the univariate problem.
As a practical matter, though, there are two substantial diﬃculties. First, even with
moderate values of , the number of parameters describing the multivariate local-to-zero
spectrum becomes fairly large. For instance, with  = 3, even the strong assumption that
under some rotation, the three variables are independent with a local-to-zero spectrum in the
-family, yields a 9-dimensional parameter space. The numerical determination of weighted
expected volume minimizing prediction sets then becomes computationally challenging.
These numerical diﬃculties are compounded by the form of the density of   and  
that is induced by the normal distribution (14). In the scalar case considered in this paper
these densities are in closed form. But in the multivariate setting, Theorem 1 of Müller and
Watson (2011) yields an expression for the density that involves an integral of dimension 2
unless Σ has a specific Kronecker form. It is an interesting question for future research how
to overcome these two computational challenges.

Remarks: Note that the linear process ∆ is not restricted to be causal. The m.d.s. structure of the driving errors  in assumption (i) allows for some departures from strict stationarity.
It also accommodates conditional heteroskedasticity, with the second order dependence limited by
the mixingale condition (15).
With the pseudo-spectrum of  defined as  () =  ()|1 − −i |2 , assumption (iii.a) is
equivalent to

since for any fixed , sup0≤≤ | −2 |1−−i
− 1| → 0. Thus, (iii.a) is equivalent to the conver|2
gence of the pseudo-spectrum of { } to  in a  −1 neighborhood of the origin in the sense of
(20).
To better understand the role of assumptions (ii) and (iii), consider some leading examples.
Suppose first that ∆ is causal and weakly dependent with exponentially decaying  , | | ≤
0 −1  for some 0  1  0, as would arise in causal and invertible ARMA models of any fixed

R∞
for any  → ∞ and 1 −2   ∞.
Second, suppose ∆ is fractionally integrated with parameter  ∈ (−12 12) (corresponding
to  being fractionally integrated of order  + 1). With ∆ scaled by  − ,  ≈ 0  − −1 ,

choosing  large. Further, for  close to zero,  () ≈ 02 ( )−2 , so that  2 () = 02  −2 , and
(17) and (18) are seen to hold under weak assumptions about higher frequency properties of ∆ .
For instance, even integrable poles in  at frequencies other than zero can be accommodated.
Third, suppose  is an AR(1) process with local-to-unity coeﬃcient  = 1 − 
and unit innovation variance. Then 0 = 1 and  = −(1 −  ) ,   0. Thus

() = 1( 2 + 2 ). Conditions (17) and (18) also hold in this example, since  () ≤ 1.
As a final example, suppose ∆ =   −  −1 (inducing  to be i.i.d. conditional
on 0 ). Here  () =  2 |1 − −i |2 = 4 2 sin(2)2 , so that () = 1, and (17) evaluates

Assumption (iv) of Theorem 1 specifies the sense in which the weights  in (19) are smooth,
so that the properties of the ()-weighted average of [ ]+1 are wholly determined by the lowfrequency properties of  . The number  is assumed to be an integer to ease notation. Note that
a constant  would not satisfy assumption (iv), as it does not integrate to zero, but all functions
of interest in the context of this paper do.
Lemma 1 For some 0     −1, let +1 : [0 ] 7→ R equal +1 () = −1[0 ≤  ≤ 1]+−1 1[1 

P
any fixed and real  , () = +1
=1   () satisfies assumption (iv) of Theorem 1.

Proof. It is clearly suﬃcient to show that each  satisfies the assumption. This follows from
a direct computation.

Let  = ( 0   )0 and  =  0 . Write  for Lebesgue measure on R , and   for the surface
measure of a  dimensional unit sphere. For  ∈ R , let  =  , where  is a point on the
surface of a  dimensional unit sphere, and  ∈ R+ . By Theorem 2.1.13 of Muirhead (1982),
 () = −1   ( )1 (). Further, for  ∈ R, consider the change of variable  =    with

More Details on the Frequentist Prediction Set
Approximate Least Favorable Distributions

The problem that underlies the frequentist set is

computed using the joint distribution of  and  given . If there exists a finite interval  ⊂ R
such that inf ∈Θ  (  ∈ ) ≥ 1 − , then  ∗ must be finite. Let Ω be a probability distribution
with support in Θ, and let Ω be the probability distribution induced by first drawing  from Ω,
and then drawing (     ) given that . Let Ω solve the problem

min Γ (vol((  ))) subject to Ω (  ∈ (  )) ≥ 1 − 


(23)

Notice that min Γ (vol(Ω (  ))) ≤  ∗ because any  that satisfies the coverage constraint in
(22) also satisfies the constraint in (23). Thus, if Λ is a distribution for , Λ is the set that solves
(23), and if inf ∈Θ  (  ∈ Λ (  )) ≥ 1 − , then Λ solves (22). Such a distribution Λ is the
least favorable distribution for this problem (cf. Theorem 3.8.1 of Lehmann and Romano (2005)
and its proof for the corresponding results in hypothesis testing).
Ω

The solution to (23) is of the form (10), that is Ω ( ) = {  : (
   ) (   )  cv   ( )},
where cv  0 is chosen so that Ω (  ∈ Ω (  )) = 1 −  (such a cv always exists as

long as (
   ) (   )  ( ) is a continuous random variable under (    ) , as is the
case in our application). To see this, note that any  is equivalently characterized by the
‘test’-function  : R × R 7→ {0 1} defined via (    ) = 1[  ∈ ( )]. In this noRR Γ 

  (    )(   )  ( )1 ( ) = ( )0 ( )1 ( ), where
Ω (  ∈ (  )) =
Γ ( ) and  ( ) =  Ω (    ). Thus, the program


(23) is equivalent to the problem of finding the best ‘test’ that rejects with probability at least 1−
when the density of   is 0 , and minimizes the “rejection probability” when the density of  
is 1 . This latter density is not integrable, but the solution still has to be of the Neyman-Pearson
form (10), as can be seen by the very argument that proves the Neyman-Pearson Lemma: Let ∗
R
correspond to Ω , and let some other  : R+1 7→ {0 1} satisfy 0 1 ≥ 1 −  (we drop  as
the dummy variable of integration for convenience). Then

where the first inequality follows from the definition of ∗ and the second from 1− = ∗ 0 1 ≤

WAV minimizing bet-proof sets as suggested by Müller and Norets (2012) described in the main
text correspond to the program (23) with the additional constraint that the prediction sets  must
Γ ( );  Γ

contain, for all realizations of  , the set [2
1−2 ( )]. The argument for the constrained
optimality of the set (11) follows from the same line of reasoning as above.
Following Elliott, Müller, and Watson (2012) we use numerical methods to approximate the
least favorable distribution Λ by a distribution Λ̃. In the construction of Λ̃, we solve (23) a little
more stringently (that is, the constraint is Λ̃ (  ∈ (  )) ≥ 1 −  +  for some small   0) to
facilitate inf ∈Θ  (  ∈ Λ̃ (  )) ≥ 1 − . Since min Γ (vol((  ))) ≤  ∗ for any Ω, we can
¡
¢
numerically assess the cost of   0 by comparing Γ vol(Λ̃ (  )) to the lower bound on  ∗
induced by the approximate least favorable Λ̃ with  = 0.

8.3.2

Numerical Approximations

Determination of approximate least favorable distribution: The algorithm consists of two main
steps: (I) determination of a candidate least favorable distribution Λ̃; (II) numerical check of
inf ∈Θ  (  ∈ Λ̃ (  )) ≥ 1 − .
Both steps are based on a discrete grid of values for , with the grid Θ
for step (II) much finer than the grid Θ for step (I). In particular, with ∆ =
{−04 −02 · · ·  12}, ∆ = {−04 −03 · · ·  14},  = {0 02 05 2 10 80},  =

and Θ = {(  )0 :  ∈    ∈ ∆  ((8)2 + 2 ) ∈  }. For each ,  (  ∈ Λ̃ (  )) is approximated via Monte Carlo integration using an importance sampling scheme: For Θ ∈ {Θ  Θ }

(23) discussed above. Thus, we seek values for ̃ that satisfy
( ̃) = 1 −  +  if ̃()  0
( ̃) ≥ 1 −  +  if ̃() = 0
An appropriate solution is determined iteratively: set ̃() () = exp(() ()), where () () ∈ R for
all  ∈ Θ . Start with  (0) () = −9 for all  ∈ Θ . Then set
 () () = (−1) () − (( ̃(−1) ) − (1 −  + )) for all  ∈ Θ
that is, decrease (increase) the value of ̃() proportional to the degree of overcoverage (undercoverage) at  ∈ Θ . This process is run with  = 2 for 4000 iterations.
The value of the slack parameter  is (0003 0005 001) for  = (01 02 05) for  ∈
{6 9 12 24}, and equal to (0005 002 002), for  = 48. For  = 48 more slack is necessary to ensure coverage under the finer grid Θ . This additional slack leads to prediction sets

that are no more than 1.0-2.5% and 1.0-5.0% longer than any set that achieves uniform coverage for  ≤ 24 and  = 48, respectively, depending on the horizon . Step (I) of the algorithm is run for  ∈  = {005 0075 01 015 02 03 04 06 08 1 12 14}, and step (II) for

X is measured quarterly and 100×ln(Xt/X−1) if X is measured annually). The exceptions are stock returns which are 400×Xt, where Xt is the gross
quarterly real return (that is, Xt = 1+Rt, where Rt is the net return), and TFP which is reported in percentage points at annual rate in the source data.
