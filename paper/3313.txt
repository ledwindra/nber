FISCAL POLICY AND THE EXTERNAL DEFICIT: SIBLINGS, BUT NOT TWINS

ABSTRACT

This paper first surveys a number of partial and macroeconomic
approaches to the determination of the current account, and then summarizes the
evidence from multicountry economic models about the linkages between U.S.
government spending and the U.S. current account during the 1 980s. The
available evidence from a large number of multicountry models suggests that the
U.S. fiscal policy of the first half of the 1980s was responsible for about half of the

buildup in the external deficit, and that the accumulated net foreign debt is about
500 billion dollars higher than it would have been without the fiscal expansion.

1. Introduction.
At the end of the 1970s, the U.S. external and government accounts were
both in rough balance.2 Over the subsequent decade, the federal fiscal deficit
and the current account deficit both grew dramatically. The federal fiscal deficit,
on a calendar-year national accounts basis, peaked at $206 billion in 1986, while

the current account deficit, after initially growing more slowly, reached $139 billion

in 1986. Both deficits were approximately $150 billion in 1987.
The purpose of this paper is to describe the linkages between these two
deficits. First I shall outline some of the alternative simplified approaches that
have been used to explain the evolution of the current account of the balance of
payments, especially those approaches that focus on the possible linkages
between the fiscal and external deficits. I shall then survey more thoroughly some
of the available evidence about the extent to which the two deficits have been

linked during the 1980s. After a review of the evidence abput the link between

-21980s fiscal policy and the 1980s current account deficit, I shall finish by

assessing the extent to which the current account might respond to possible
future changes in fiscal policy, The linkages between fiscal policy and the current
account in the 1990s might be expected to be different than they were in the
I 980s, since the U.S. external position has changed from large net creditor to net
debtor, changing the extent to which interest rates and exchange rates influence

the U.S. current account

2. Alternative Approaches to the External Deficit.
There are both partial and macroeconomic approaches to the current
account.

2.1 Partial Approaches.
The chief and most long-standing partial approach to the current account
explains the evolution of imports and exports separately, with each being
determined by relative prices and spending in the United States and its trading
partners. Some of these analyses focus on the relative rates of spending growth,
and on the income elasticities measuring the extent to which U.S. imports
respond to growth in U.S. spending, and the extent to which U.S. exports
respond to increases in foreign spendThg. Separate estimation of U.S. import and
export equations frequently shows that imports respond to increases in U.S.

spending by more than U.S. exports respond to increases in foreign spending,
thus giving rise to the worry that there may be a secular decline in the U.S. trade
balance unless there are continuing falls in the real value of the U.S. dollar or

higher rates of spending growth outside the United States.4

4 For example, the U.S. current account blocks of the six multicountry models
whose properties are surveyed by Bryant, Holtham and Hooper (1988, p. 133)
show long-run income elasticities averaging 1.87 for non-oil imports and 1.27 for
goods exports.

-3Other studies emphasize the role of relative prices in the determination of

imports and exports. Three key questions arise, relating to the influence of
exchange rates on trade prices, the influence of trade prices on trade flows, and
the possibility that initial import price effects are sufficiently larger than the volume

effects so that a drop in the value of the dollar may initially lead to a worsening of
the nominal current account, even though real imports are falling and real exports
rising.

With respect to the first question, the pass-through of the exchange rate
into trade prices, the traditional assumption has been that primary commodities
are sold at prices set in world markets, while most manufactures are sold at prices
set separately by each supplier. Under this simple view, a drop in the value of the
U.S. dollar would lead to a corresponding increase in the U.S. price of Japanese
cars, since the U.S. price would be equal to the fixed Japanese Yen price
multiplied by the higher number of U.S. dollars required to buy enough Yen to pay
for the car. However, recent research5 and even casual observation have
revealed that most manufacturers selling into large foreign markets are acutely
aware of pressures on their market share, and hence tend to absorb, at least in
the short-run, much of the effect of exchange rate changes, thus insulating U.S.
import prices from the initial effects of exchange rate changes. This tends to defer
the eventual volume adjustments, but if the initial import volume effects are
sufficiently small then the lags in the 'pass through' of exchange rate changes to
import prices may actually improve rather than worsen the U.S. nominal trade
balance, at least initially, in the face of a drop in the value of the dollar.

5 See, for example, Branson and Marston (1989), Froot and Klemperer (1988),
Krugman (1987). Mann (1986) and Marston (1989).

-4"Elasticity pessimism" is the expression used to describe the view that the

volume of trade responds so little to a change in the exchange rate that the

nominal US. current account might actually worsen in response to a lowering in
the value of the dollar. Most empirical evidence suggests that there is a shortterm worsening in the current account in response to a lower value of the dollar,
but that this effect is reversed by the second year.6 The initial worsening of the

nominal current account, followed by a subsequent improvement, poses
problems chiefly because of its effects on expectations. If a large drop in the
value of the dollar is followed by further worsening of the current account, market
participants are likely to become pessimistic about the future prospects for U.S.
"competitiveness", leading to still larger drops in the value of the currency. The
same influence, in reverse, may well have been part of the story of the dramatic
rise in the value of the dollar between 1982 and March 1985.

'

Partial approaches to the current account are helpful in explairing some

key elements of trade decisions. However, they do not help to unravel the
linkages between fiscal policy and the current account, because they stop short
at the proximate determinants of trade flows, which are expenditures and relative

prices. To get further, we need to adopt a more macroeconomic approach, in
which the levels of aggregate expenditure, prices and exchange rates are
themselves determined.

2.2 Macroeconomic Approaches.

6 For example, five of the six multicountry models analyzed by Bryant, Hoitham
and Hooper (1988 p. 113) have U.S. current account blocks that show a first-year
worsening of the nominal current account by an amount averaging, for the five
models, 0.37% of I3NP, from a 20% decline in the nominal value of the U.S. dollar.
In four of these five models, the current account effect becomes positive by the
second year. In the fifth model, the negative section of the 'J-curve' lasts until the
third year.

-5Several simplified macroeconomic approaches have been used to explain

the evolution of the current account. In these simple approaches, the
determination and role of the exchange rate, and of relative prices more generally,
are suppressed, or at least treated in an implicit manner. The core of these
approaches is the national income and expenditure relationship, wherein the level
of real national output V is the sum of final domestic expenditure (equal to the sum
of consumption, investment and government spending on goods and services,

=C+I+G, often referred to as domestic absorption) plus net exports (X-M).
the absorption approach makes use of the fact that the current account,
or net exports of goods and services in this simple exposition, (which excludes
foreign transfer payments, such as foreign aid and immigrants' remittances, and
ignores the special factors determining net investment income) is equal to the

excess of output over absorption. Thus anything that increases absorption, such
as an increase in government spending, will increase the current account deficit
by the same amount, except to the extent that the increase in government
spending is offset by reductions in consumption or investment spending, or
provided by increases in output. A 'supply-side' approach to the U.S. fiscal policy
in the early 1980s would have argued that the tax cuts could have induced

enough extra effort, and hence output, to provide for the extra spending, either by
governments, or by private consumers or businesses with higher after-tax
incomes, to avoid large buildups in either the fiscal deficit or the current account.
An important variant of the absorption approach is provided by a demandoriented open-economy Keynesian multiplier approach, in which aggregate
income is increased by the increase in government spending, and the current

account worsened by the induced change in imports, by an amount roughly

-6equal, under fixed exchange rates, to the marginal propensity to import times the
inorease in income.
Under flexible exchange rates, the effects of fiscal policy on the external

deficit depend on the degree of capital mobility, and on the nature of exchange
rate expectations. If there is no capital mobility, the cuirrency would depreciate,
under fiscal expansion, by enough to close off the import leakage, thus insulating
the current account from the Vscal deficit. Under perfect capital mobility, with
static expectations about exchange rates and prices, this model, first developed
by Robed Mundell7, forces the domestic currency to appreciate under fiscal
expansion, by enough to fully crowd out any increase in income, thus forcing the
induced fiscal deficit to be matched by an external deficit of the same size.

A number of more recent macroeconomic approaches have set up the
same national income relationship in a different way, so as to emphasize the
identity between domestic investment and total savings. Rewriting the familiar

national income identity to show investment on the left-hand side, and adding
taxes to allow a distinction between private and public saving, domestic
investment can be seen to be equal to the sum of private, government and foreign

saving:

= (V-I-C) + (T-C) + (M-X).
Seen this way, net foreign savings, which are net imports of goods and services,
and hence are simply the current account deficit, are the amount by which
investment spending exceeds net national savings, which in turn is the sum of
private and government savings. Thus any increase in the fiscal deficit would lead
7 The model with perfect capital mobility and static expectations was first
presented in Mundell (1963), as a special oase of the model with imperfect capital
mobility developed earlier by Mundell and also by Meade (1951) and Fleming
(1962). The model, especially the version with perfect capital mobility is often
referred to as the Mundell-Fleming model, with subsequent uses and
developments surveyed by Frenkel and Razin (1987b).

-7to a one-for-one increase in the current account deficit (i.e. net foreign savings)
unless there were offsetting reductions in domestic investment (e.g. being
crowded out by higher domestic interest rates) or increases in private savings
(generated, e.g.. by higher income levels, or by tax changes influencing saving
decisions, as emphasized in some supply-side approaches).
Four particular cases of the savings-investment approach are worthy of
special mention.
1. The 'twin deficit' view, known earlier in the United Kingdom as the 'New

Cambridge' approach, in which there is a one-for-one offset of changes in
government savings (i.e. the fiscal surplus) and foreign savings (as measured by
the current account deficit). Thus any increase in the fiscal deficit would be
matched by an increase in the external deficit - a reduction in public savings being
offset by an increase in foreign savings. The assumption here is that any induced
changes in domestic investment are exactly matched by changes in private
savings. In the event that the higher fiscal deficit led to a net reduction in private
investment spending (with 'crowding our caused by higher interest rates
exceeding the 'accelerator effects' from the higher levels of output), this would

require a reduction in private savings for the twin deficits view to hold precisely. If
the higher fiscal deficit led to higher incomes and hence higher private savings,
then the current account deficit would be smaller than the fiscal deficit, unless
induced private investment more than used up the induced private savings.

2. National saving determines domestic investment This view stresses the longestablished correlation between national saving rates (i.e. the sum of private

savings and government savings) and domestic investment rates (i.e. the amount
of capital expenditures in the domestic economy). Feldstein and Horioka (1980)
analyzed this evidence in an important paper arguing that measures to increase

-8national savings, whether by governments or the private sector, would be likely to
lead to higher investment rates, and hence to greater economic growth in the
future. To the extent that the link from national savings to private investment flows
through interest rates, a greater fiscal deficit might, according to this view, lead to
some increase in the current account deficit to the extent that the higher interest
rates induce a higher real value of the dollar.

3. The Intertemporal Approach (e.g. Frenkel and Razin 1987a) assumes full
employment, perfect foresight, perfect international markets for capital and
tradeable goods, and studies how the international implications of government
deficits depend on the source and timing of the deficit, the relative saving

propensities of the public and private sectors, and the relative extent to which
public spending falls on tradeable and non-tradeable goods. As would be
expected, a fiscal deficit caused by a temporary increase in spending is more
likely to increase the current account deficit if the spending is concentrated on
tradeable goods (Frenkel and Razin 1988b, pp.20-27). The effects of tax changes
are especially complex, depending also on which type of tax is being changed, as
well as on the timing and preference factors coming into play with changes in

government spending.8
As Dornbusch (1989) and others have pointed out, one implication of the
perfect markets and far-sighted optimizing behaviour assumed in this approach is
that there is no policy significance to any current account or fiscal imbalances.
One of the most important benefits of the intertemporal approach has been
to focus attention on the likely timing and duration of fiscal actions, and on the
nature of private expectations about future government spending and taxes. As
8 Under a certain configuration of preferences, Frenkel and Razin (1988a, p.313)
show that a deficit caused by a fall in taxation of consumption or on foreign
borrowing tends to worsen the current acoount, while lower income taxation
tends to improve it.

-9we shall see later, temporary and permanent changes in spending can have very
different effects on output, interest rates, exchange rates, and the current

account.
The Ricardian approach (Barro 1974. 1989) is a special case of the
intertemporal optimization approach, in which (infinitely) long-lived consumers
foresee the future taxes eventually required to finance deficits created by current

tax reductions, and reduce their current consumption correspondingly, so that
there is no link between fiscal deficits and the current account, at least to the
extent that the deficits are caused by changes in tax rates.9

4. The sustainability approach (eg. Krugman 1988) also focuses on savings and
investment balances, but differs from the intertemporal optimization approach by
raising the possibility that markets are insufficiently forward-looking, or
insufficiently consistent in their macroeconomic expectations, to foresee the future
consequences of today's external deficits. In particular, the approach calculates
whether the market's expected rate of future decline of the dollar in real terms, as

measured by current real interest rate differentials, is large enough to eventually
stop the growth in the ratio of external debt to GNP. If it is not, then the current
level of the exchange rate is described as unsustainable. The application of the

approach by Krugman was based only on the impact of the exchange rate on the
current account balance, and put aside the other links between final spending and
the current account. Other versions of the savings and investment approach
emphasize the spending links more directly, with the exchange rate playing a

9 Barro (1989, p. 40) notes that Ricardian equivalence, and the lack of relation
between budget deficits and the current account, applies strictly only to deficits
created by changing the pattern of taxes for a given flow of government
expenditures. However, the empirical evidence he reports relates to correlations
between government deficits and the current account, without reference to the
sources of the government deficits.

- 10facilitating role, by moving far enough to enable continual matching of the current
account with desired capital movements.
Further removed from the savings and investment approaches, but sharing
with the Krugman approach the view that market participants may value the dollar
at unsustainable or undesirable levels, is the Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange
Rate (FEER) approach of Williamson (1985) and Williamson and Miller (1987).

This approach addresses the sustainability issue in a different way, by starting
with some assumption about the desired accumulation of net foreign liabilities,
and then calculating the exchange rate path that would be "expected to generate
a current account surplus or deficit equal to the underlying capital flow over the
cycle, given that the country is pursuing 'internal balance' as best it can and not

restricting trade for baiance of payments reasons." (Williamson 1985, p. 113).
The evidence reported in the following sections of this paper is not directly
focussed on the question of sustainability, for either exchange rates or current
account balances, except to the extent that these issues arise in particular
models. The main focus of attention will be on the empirical linkages shown
between fiscal deficits and external deficits. All of the models used to provide the

evidence are both macroeconomic and international, providing for determination
of trade flows, interest rates and exchange rates for all of the major countries,
usually within a consistent treatment of the global patterns of trade and
investment. Some of the models presume fully forward-looking behaviour by
consumers and investors, and some do not; the differences between these two
types of model will be examined after a preliminary review of the evidence from a
larger sample of models.

3. How Closely Related Are the FIscal and External Deficits?
It is not very helpful to examine simple correlations between fiscal deficits

and external deficits, either over time for a single country or across countries,

—11-

since both variables represent the results of many forces, some of which make
the two deficits move together, and others apart. For example, a self-inspired
investment boom in the United States would tend to raise U.S. GDP, to lower the
fiscal deficit and to raise the external deficit. On the other hand, a drop in U.S.

exports caused by a fall in foreign demand would tend to lower U.S. GDP, and to
raise both the fiscal and external deficits, with the effects on the external deficit

being generally greater than those on the fiscal deficit.
As for the links from government spending to the current account, the size

of the effect is much in dispute, although most approaches would show some
positive connection; that an increase in the fiscal deficit would, to the extent that it
also raised real income, domestic prices, interest rates and the exchange rate,
also tend to increase the external deficit How can the size of the effect best be
measured? Since simple theoretical models cant help to establish the

magnitudes, and complex theoretical models soon become ambiguous in their
predictions of even the net direction of effects, there is no realistic alternative to
the use of empirical models that represent the key elements of macroeconomic

structure.
In order to capture the exchange rate and foreign trade effects of fiscal

policy, the frameworks or models used must also capture the trading decisions of
other countries. To do this in a consistent manner, a number of models have
been developed that treat the main industrial countries in a fairly complete and
symmetric manner, usually with a more limited treatment of income and trade
determination in the rest of the world.
Over the past five years, several collaborative workshops have been held,

sponsored on one or more occasions by the Brookings Institution, the Federal
Reserve Board, the IMF, and the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, to bring
together the major multicountry models of economic activity and trade, to

-12corn pare their properties, and to assess their implications for major policy issues
of the day.10 Since one of the key issues has been the explanation of the U.S.
external deficit, including the linkage between fiscal policy and the external deficit,
the results of this collaborative research are easily focussed on the twin deficits

question.
What does the evidence show'? First some results, and then some cautions
and qualifications. I shaH first present the basic results showing the consequences

of an increase in debt-financed U.S. government spending, sustained over the six
years shown, equal to 1% of real GNP. For an average of the results from ten

multicountry models, Figure 1 shows the effects on the fiscal deficit and on the
external deficit, in both cases measured as a percent of baseline GNP.1 1 To give

some approximate measure of the spread of the results, a band (plus and minus
one standard deviation) is drawn about each of the averages.12
10 The conferences and models involved are described in more detail, with
references to the primary descriptions of the participating models, in Bryant,
HeIRwell and Hooper (1989).
11 The data were prepared in comparable form and reported in Bryant, Helliwell
and Hooper (1989). The sample of ten models reported here is the BHH twelvemodel sample removing two models for which some of the series reported in this
paper were not available. Appendix Table A-4 reports the primary data for a larger
sample of eighteen 'models' (some of which are different versions of the same
model), which in turn is the full twenty-model sample used by BHH less two
models for which not all the series were available. Most of the model runs used a
decrease in U.S. federal spending, and all of the results were converted to that
basis, assuming approximate linearity of responses, for the experiments reported
in BHH. For this paper, the results are reported as though the expenditure
changes were increases in government spending, so as to make the evidence
more easily applicable to explaining the increasing fiscal and external deficits of
the 1980s.
12 A strict interpretation of these standard deviations would require that the
observed properties were based on samples from a population of models with
normally distributed properties. The models could be considered to differ by
being different estimates of the properties of an underlying tue model of the
economy, or else being representative of the variety of models actually used by
those forming expectations of the effects of policies. The observations are in fact
neither independent nor random, as some models have been excluded on the
basis of implausible properties, some of the results are from slightly different
versions of the same model, and some of the models are intentionally similar to
one another. In addition, the distributions are not normal, especially in the
eighteen model sample, where, especially in the later years, the distributions are

- 13In all cases, the initial effect of the government spending on the fiscal deficit
is less than the initial size of the spending, reflecting the positive effect of the

spending on income and tax revenues. As time progresses, however, the size of
the induced deficit increases as a share of baseline nominal GNP, mainly because

of the interest payments on the increasing public debt, but partly also because of
the higher interest rates and price levels. For the first two years, the net effect on
the fiscal deficit averages about 0.6% of GNP. It increases thereafter, passing
through 1% in the fourth year.13
The current account deficit effect starts at .25% of GNP, increasing sharply

to .35% in the second year, and then growing more gradually thereafter. The
second year growth reflects the working through of the J-curve effects of the
higher value of the U.S. dollar, while the continuing increase thereafter reflects

both the continuing loss of competitiveness in response to the growing real value
of the dollar and interest payments on the growing external debt.
Figure 2 brings together the effects on the fiscal and external deficits to

show the extent to which the two deficits move together in response to an
increase in government spending. In the first year, the ratio of the induced
external deficit to the induced fiscal deficit is just under one-half (.48). It rises in the

second year, reflecting the sharp second-year increase in the external deficit
effects described above, and then returns to just below one-half, ranging between
.45 and .49 for the rest of the six-year period. The fairly narrow bands around the
average show that the models, despite their diversity of structure, all show that the
two deficits are closely related but tar from being twins.

- 14Figure 3 shows that the increasing effects of government spending on the
two deficits are not because real spending and output continue to grow- on the
contrary, the average real GNP effects of the fiscal expansion shcw multipliers of
about 1.4 in the first two years, dropping steadily thereafter, averaging 0.5 in the
sixth year. Figure 4 shows that the real GNP effects are smaller in the models with

forward-looking or model-consistent expectations, usually referred to as rational
expectations. This happens because in these models the future crowding-out
effects are foreseen, especially in financial and foreign exchange markets, so that

long-term interest rates and the exchange rate rise more, and much sooner, than
in models where expectations adjust adaptively. Although the real exchange rate
crowding out therefore occurs faster in the models with consistent expectations,
the effects on the nominal current account build up more slowly, as the J-curve
effects take a year or more to work themselves out.

4. What If Fiscal Policy Had Been Different in the 1980s?
To get some rough answer to this question, simulations with the
INTERMOD multicountry model14 have been used to estimate how different the
U.S. deficit and debt position in the 1980s might have been if U.S. fiscal policy had
been less expansionary in the first half of the 1980s. This can only be done in a
very approximate manner, as there is no easy definition of what the alternative
fiscal policy might have been, and even less way of knowing the extent to which
the actual fiscal policy changes were foreseen by the financial markets, a factor
14 The model was developed in the Canadian Federal Department of Finance,
based on the 1988 version of the IMPs MULT1MOD (Masson et al, 1988),
extended to include separate country blocks for each of the 0-7 economies, and
prepared in both mainframe and PC versions, as described in Helliwell, Meredith,
Durand and Bagnoli (1990). The simulations reported in this section use version
1.2, which differs from the earlier version principally by implementing a monetary
policy that holds the money supply unchanged in response to fiscal changes,
instead of the earlier monetary policy reaction function that dampened the
interest-rate effects of fiscal policy changes. Version 1.2 has a monetary sector
with properties very like the average of those of the rnulticountry models surveyed
by Helliwell, Cockerline and Lafrance (1988).

-15that has great importance in models with forward-looking expectations. To avoid
making any personal guesses on the nature of the alternative policy, I use the
Kelkie-Hooper (1988, Table 2-15) estimates of the cumulative federal government
fiscal expansion between 1980 and 1985, approximately equal to the IMF

estimates of federal government fiscal expansion, totalling some 3.5% of GNP.
On the presumption that the broad features, but not the year-to-year variations of
the fiscal expansion were foreseen by financial markets, the increases are spread
evenly over the years 1980 to 1985. The fiscal expansion is then left constant in

real terms (about $100 billion 1980 dollars) for the rest of the decade, and then

subsequently removed.'5
Figures 5 and 6 show the results of this fiscal policy experiment, using both
adaptive and consistent expectations versions of INTERMOD. Figure 5 shows the
effects on the fiscal and external deficits, and also on the ratio of the external debt
to GNP, while Figure 6 shows the effects on interest rates and the exchange rate,

under the assumption that the money supply is the same under the two alternative
patterns of government spending.
The results based on model-consistent expectations, combined with the
assumption that the fiscal expansion was foreseen, suggest that the 1986 fiscal
deficit was 3.3% of GNP larger (about $140 billion), and the current account deficit
1.3% of GNP larger (about $55 billion) than they would have been without the

fiscal expansion. As the figures show, the current account effects continue to rise
through the decade, as the foreign debt share continues to build up. Because the
15 This is to avoid the possibility of unstable long-term solutions of the models
with forward-looking expectations. In these models, an unsustainable fiscal policy
is foreseen by the financial markets, so that the future fiscal policy must be
consistent with the model's portfolio equilibrium conditions. The fiscal expansion
is reduced by 20% of the annual declining balance in each year following 1990.
This has no effect on the 1980s results for models with adaptive expectations,
since policies expected to be introduced after 1990 have no explicit effects on
1980s behaviour in these models.

- 16future increases in government spending are foreseen at the beginning of the
decade, there are immediate increases in the external value of the dollar16, and in

long-term interest rates, that almost completely crowd out the income-increasing
effects of the government spending.17
Under adaptive expectations, the future effects of the fiscal expansion are
not foreseen, and the increases in the value of the dollar, arid in long-term interest
rates, are much less. As a result, the increases in income are larger, and the
government deficit increases are generally smaller, under adaptive expectations.

The external deficit comparison is more ambiguous. Under adaptive expectations,
the higher income means higher real imports, which tend to make the current
account effects larger. However, there is much less increase in the value of the
dollar, and hence much less reduction in real net exports via that channel.
However, the nominal current account is less rapidly affected by these relative
price effects, because the dollar cost of U.S. imports falls when the dollar is
stronger, as it is under consistent expectations. As time progresses, the external
deficit effects become much larger, especially under consistent expectations,
when the J-curve effects have time to work themselves through.
A striking feature of the resufts, under both adaptive and consistent

expectations, is the build-up of government and external debt, and the growing
importance of debt service charges. By the end of 1989, net foreign debt is higher
by $500 billion, and government debt $1000 billion higher, under consistent
16 The importance of expected future budget deficits in determining the value of
the dollar has been widely studied and emphasized, e.g. by Feldstein (1986).
17 As shown in Figure 4.1 of Bryant, Helliwell and I-looper (1989), expected future
increases in government spending can lower aggregate spending when they are
announced, because the crowding-out effects of the exchange rate and long-term
interest rates appear immediately, while the demand-expanding effects of the
government spending appear only later. Similar effects of anticipated future
spending are shown by other researchers using model-consistent expectations,
e.g. Masson and Blundell-Wignall (1986), Haas and Masson (1986) and McKibbin
and Sachs (1989, Table 6).

-17expectations.18 As a result of the accumulation of foreign debt, there is a
substantial wedge created between real output (GDP, or value-added within the
United States) and real income (GNP, real income accruing to U.S. residents),

equal to the reduction of net interest and dividend income from foreigners. By
1989, real GNP has fallen by more than 1% relative to GDP, representing the net

cost of servicing the foreign debt.
The numbers used in this section are not intended as precise estimates,

since they come from only one of many models,19 and, more importantly,
because we cannot know to what extent the fiscal expansion of the 1 980s was

foreseen, and hence how much of the higher interest rates and higher exchange
value of the dollar can properly be attributed to it.2° Nevertheless, the evidence
from a substantial number of models, and from several alternative approaches,
suggests that the U.S. fiscal policy of the first half of the 1980s was responsible for
about half of the buildup of the external deficit, and that cumulated foreign debt is
now about half a trillion dollars higher than it would have been without the fiscal
expansion.
If U.S. fiscal policy was not responsible for more than half of the 1980s
growth of the external deficit, what were the remaining factors? One frequent
candidate is tighter U.S. monetary policy, which helped to raise the value of the
18 Under adaptive expectations, where the expansionary effects of the fiscal
policy are larger, the debt build-up is smaller: $400 billion in external debt and
$800 billion of government debt.
19 The debt accumulation results are not available for a wider variety of models.
Not all of the multicountry models account fully for the interactions between debt
accumulation, both domestic and foreign, and the resulting debt service
payments.
20 In addition, the interaction between deficits and debt is strong enough that the
baseline matters. The INTERMOD estimates of the effects of the U.S. fiscal policy
on the external deficit would be slightly smaller if the experiments were run on a
baseline that excluded the policies. On the other hand, INTERMOD and
MULTIMOD both have an endogenous tax policy that comes into play to
guarantee that the debt/GNP ratio does not become explosive, and this plays a
role in limiting the estimates of the induced fiscal deficit, and hence debt, in the
latter half of the 1980s.

-18dollar and hence to crowd out real net exports. However, when the multicountry
models are run under tighter U.S. monetary policy, they typically show very little
net effect on the external deficit. For example, Table 3.1 of Bryant, Helliwell and

Hooper (1989) shows that a 1% U.S. monetary expansion lowers the value of the
U.S. dollar by about 1%, on average, but has no net effect on the current account,
since the relative price effects are offset by the increased imports caused by the
higher levels of U.S. final demand.
Another widely studied possibility is that the exchange market over-valued
the U.S. dollar in the middle 1980s, independent of the induced effects of the
monetary and fiscal polices of the time, and that this added to the external deficit.
The multicountry models show, on average, that each 1% increase in the value of

the dollar, not caused by either fiscal or monetary policy changes, worsens the
U.S. current account, in the third year, by somewhat less than $1 billion.21
There is also the possibility, noted by Genberg (1988) and others, that
abnormal increases in private investment spending, whether based on changes in
the tax rules and rates applicable to investment spending (which have not been
expLicitly incorporated in the fiscal policy assessments in this paper), or to

changes in business confidence, could also have contributed to the increase in
the current account deficit, at least during the period when the new capacity has
not been fully brought on stream.
Finally, there is the role of fiscal contraction in countries outside North
America. The G-7 countries outside North America followed generally restrictive

fiscal policies over the first half of the 1980s, by amounts averaging about 25% of
their GNP, as estimated by Helkie and Hooper (1988, Table 2-17). Table 1 below
21 A gradual depreciation of the dollar, totalling just under 25% by the fourth year,
improves the U.S. current account, in that year, by about $19 billion, as reported
for an average of Ii models in Bryant, Henderson, et al, eds. (1988,
Supplemental Volume, Table F, p. 100).

shows INTERMOD estimates of the linkages between the fiscal and external

deficit consequences of separate fiscal expansions (with spending increased by
amounts equal to 1% of GDP) in each of the G-7 economies, with the countries

shown in ascending order of size from top to bottom. All seven countries show
substantial linkages between the external and fiscal deficits, with the external
deficit effects being slightly greater for the smaller and more open economies.
Italy provides a slight exception, due mainly to the high private savings rate there,
an often-noted feature of the Italian economy.22

22 The data are drawn from Tables Al and A3-A8 of Helliwell, Meredith et al
(1990). It should perhaps be noted that the three savings rates (private,
government and foreign) do not sum to zero, as a percentage of baseline nominal
GNP, but to the change in nominal investment, also measured as a share of
baseline GNP. Thus international differences in the extent to which private
investment is induced or crowded out by the fiscal expansion can also play a role
in mediating the differences between the external and fiscal deficit effects. All of
the G-7 countries show induced investment, averaging about the same as Italy's
.6% of baseline GNP, while Italy's personal savings, at 1.25%, is among the

highest.

-20Precise calculation Of the implications of foreign fiscal policy for the U.S.

current account would require taking account of each country's policy separately,
since each of the G-7 countries has different trading links with the United States.

However, a reasonable approximation can be provided by using the evidence fcc
changes in government spending in the non-U.S. members of the OECD (referred
to as the 'rest of the OECD' or ROECD), as provided for the 1986 Brookings

conference, and reported in Bryant, Henderson et al, eds. (1988). Using this
evidence, Helkie and Hooper (1988, Table 2-17) estimate that the tighter fiscal
policy in the ROECD contributed an additional $25 billion to the U.S. external

deficit in 1986.
Putting together the model-based evidence of the external deficit effects of
U.S. fiscal policy, foreign fiscal policy, and other factors leading to dollar
appreciation in the 1980s, Helkie and Hooper (1988, Table 2-17) estimate that
about $135 billion of the 1986 U.S. current account deficit can be explained.23 In
any event, the aim of this paper is not to explain fully the evolution of the U.S.

current account, which raises a number of larger issues, but to spell out the
evidence linking U.S. fiscal policy to the external deficit. This evidence is perhaps
best summarized by a 50% rule of thumb - that an increase in the fiscal deficit

arising from changes in government spending, in the macroeconomic
environment of the 1980s, is likely to have been accompanied by an increase in
the external deficit about half as large.

5. Implications for the 1990s
This paper has been devoted to a summary of the model-based evidence
of the linkage between fiscal policy and the external deficit in the 1980s. The

experiments used were based on the analysis of changes in the current and
23 Subsequent refinements of these estimates are reported in Hooper and Mann
(1989).

- 21 -

future levels of government spending, where (at least in the models with

consistent or forward-looking expectations) the proposed changes in future
spending were fully credible to all participants. The real world is more complicated

than this in at least two important ways. First, the political process does not
operate so as to provide a close link between currently announced objectives and
actual future policy, so that any announcement of future policy is bound to be
discounted at least partially in the minds of market participants.24 Second, given

the inevitable uncertainty about future events, institutions and behaviour, policies
are perhaps better analyzed in terms of the reactions of policy-makers to
unfolding events. There is increasing research using models to evaluate
alternative policy rules in this way25, but so far there is no evidence available on
the design and consequences of alternative deficit reduction strategies in this
more general framework. In any event, benchmark estimates of the type surveyed
in this paper will remain relevant to more complex studies of policy strategies.
To what extent is the evidence presented in this paper transferable to the
1 990s? Several of the experiments included in the results for this paper were in

fact based on the consequences of reductions in U.S. government spending
starting in 1987 or 1988, and extending into the 1990s. These results thus largely

incorporate the accumulated debt levels of this period, and the broad features of

24 This may have the effect of making the actual effects of policies fall in between
the paths predicted by models with adaptive and rational (i.e. model-consistent)
expectations. This is by no means sure, however, as it depends on the structure
and diversity of the processes actually used by market participants to form their
expectations about future policy, as well as on their beliefs about the structure of
the economy itself.
25 Current examples of the evaluation of alternative monetary policy rules,
including the implications for policy coordination, include Frenkel, Goldstein and
Masson (1989) and Taylor (1989). Evaluation of policy rules in a stochastic
environment is the focus of continuing collaborative research among users of
multicountry models, with a workshop to be held in Washington in the spring of
1990.

- 22 -

the results are likely to be relevant for assessments covering the first half of the
1990s.

It is therefore likely to remain the case, to the extent that the models

assessed come close to capturing the main elements of macroeconomic
linkages, that reductions in the fiscal deficit will, on their own, contribute to a
reduction in the external deficit about half as great. This arises from the combined
effects of the lower domestic final demand and the higher foreign demand
spurred by the lower real value of the dollar. The lower real value of the dollar
comes about partly from a lower nominal value and partly from a lower U.S.
inflation rate.

On the other hand, monetary expansion, whether intended to offset the
temporary contractionary effects of fiscal deficit reduction26 or to lower the value
of the dollar to help encourage net exports, has almost no net effect on the
external deficit, despite a very large effect on the value of the dollar.27

Drops in the value of the dollar coming from other sources than changes in
fiscal and monetary policies are estimated, with much imprecision, to have only a

slight net effect on the external deficit Thus the link between the exchange rate
and the external deficit depends critically on what is making the exchange rate
move. According to the evidence surveyed here, a lower value of the dollar only

26 Almost all of the multicountry models surveyed show that there is complete or
nearly complete crowding out (or crowding in, in the case of fiscal contraction) of
real private spending and net exports in the medium term, in response to changes
in government spending, so that the real GNP effects of budget reductions are
temporary, although spread over years rather than months. The models with
forward-looking expectations also show that credibly announced future changes
in fiscal policy have much smaller real GNP effects, since the exchange rates and
long-term interest rates move quickly so as to accelerate the substitution of
private expenditures for public ones.
27 As shown by the results in Bryant, Henderson et al, eds. (1985, Supplemental
volume, Table E, p. 87). The inflationary effects of the monetary expansion
combine with the expenditure-increasing effects to offset the increases in net
exports that might otherwise be expected to follow from a reduction in the value of
the dollar.

- 23 -

has a material effect on the external deficit when it is caused by a change in
domestic final spending. Thus, to the extent that reducing the external deficit

should become a focus of macroeconomic policy, reductions in the fiscal deficit
provide the policy instrument.
Since the two deficits are siblings (half-sisters or half-brothers?) rather than
twins, domestic policy alone is not likely to remove the external deficit entirely,

especially in the short-run. Higher real growth in countries outside North America,
as would be implied by their continuing convergence towards North American
levels of real income and productivity, is therefore likely to be a welcome partner

to domestic fiscal policy in obtaining and maintaining both fiscal and external
balance. Once internal balance and sustainability of the external position seem
secure, however, there seems little reason why the external deficit or surplus

should be a focus of special policy attention anyway, beyond being an interesting
record of the international pattern of saving and investment.
