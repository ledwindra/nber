Linearity-Generating Processes: A Modelling Tool Yielding Closed Forms for Asset Prices

JEL No. E43,G12,G13
ABSTRACT
This methodological paper presents a class of stochastic processes with appealing properties for theoretical
or empirical work in finance and macroeconomics, the "linearity-generating" class. Its key property
is that it yields simple exact closed-form expressions for stocks and bonds, with an arbitrary number
of factors. It operates in discrete and continuous time. It has a number of economic modeling applications.
These include macroeconomic situations with changing trend growth rates, or stochastic probability
of disaster, asset pricing with stochastic risk premia or stochastic dividend growth rates, and yield
curve analysis that allows flexibility and transparency. Many research questions may be addressed
more simply and in closed form by using the linearity-generating class.

Introduction

This methodological paper defines and analyzes a class of stochastic processes that has a
number of attractive properties for economics and finance, the “linearity-generating” (LG)
processes. It is generates closed-form solutions for the prices of stocks and bonds. It is simple
and flexible, applies to an arbitrary number of factors with a rich correlation structure, and
works in discrete or continuous time. These features make it an easy-to-use tool for pure
and applied financial modelling.
The main advantage of the LG class is that it generates, with very little eﬀort, tractable
multifactor stock and bond models, in a way that incorporates stochastic growth rates of
dividends, and a stochastic equity premium. Stock and bond prices are linear in the factors
— hence the name “linearity-generating” processes.
Economically, a process is in the LG class if it satisfies two moment conditions: the
expected growth rate of the stochastic discount factor (multiplied by the dividend, if one
prices stocks), is linear in the factor. And, the expected growth rate of the stochastic
discount factor, times the vector of factors next period, is also linear in the factors (Eq. 910). Given only those moments, one can price stocks and bonds (i.e., finite maturity claims
on dividends). Higher order moments do not matter. In many applications, the variance of
processes can be changed almost arbitrarily and the prices will not change. The fact that a
few moments are enough to derive prices makes modelling easier.
Linearity-generating processes are meant to be a practical tool for several areas in economics. They are likely to be useful in: macroeconomics, with models with stochastic trend
growth rate or probability of disaster; asset pricing, with models with stochastic equity
premium, interest rate, or earnings growth rate.
Several literatures motivate the need for a tool such as the LG process. Many recent
studies investigate the importance of long-term risk for asset pricing and macroeconomics,
e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004), Barro (2006), Croce, Lettau and Ludvigson (2006), Gabaix
and Laibson (2002), Hansen, Heaton and Li (2005), Hansen and Scheinkman (2006), Julliard
and Parker (2004), Lettau and Wachter (2007). The LG process oﬀers a way to model longterm risk, while keeping a closed form for stock prices. In addition, there is debate about the
existence and mechanism of the time-varying expected stock market returns, e.g., Boudoukh
2

et al. (forth.), Campbell and Shiller (1988), Cochrane (forth.) and many others. Because
of the lack of closed forms, the literature relies on simulations and approximations. The LG
process oﬀers closed forms for stocks with time-varying equity premium, which is useful for
thinking about those issues.
The motivation for the LG class is inspired by the broad applicability and empirical
success of the aﬃne class identified by Duﬃe and Kan (1996), and further developed by
Dai and Singleton (2000) and Duﬃe, Pan and Singleton (2000), which includes the Vasicek
(1977) and the Cox, Ingersoll, Ross (1985) processes as special cases. Much theoretical and
empirical work is done with the aﬃne class. Some of this could be done with the LG class.
Section 6.2 develops the link between the LG class and the aﬃne class. The two classes
give the same quantitative answers to a first order. The main advantage of the LG class is
for stocks. The LG class gives a simple closed-form expression for stocks, whereas the aﬃne
class needs to express stocks as an infinite sum. Hence, while the aﬃne class can be expected
to be remain for long the central model for options and bonds, one can think that the LG
class may be a auxiliary technique for bonds, but will be particularly useful for stocks.
Closed forms for stocks, or perpetuities, are not available with the current popular
processes, such as the aﬃne models those of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck / Vasicek (1977) and Cox,
Ingersoll, Ross (1985), or models in the aﬃne class (Duﬃe and Kan 1996). Those models
simply generate infinite sum of terms.
Several papers have derived closed forms for stocks. Bakshi and Chen (1996) derive a
closed form, which is an exponential-aﬃne function of a square root process. Mamayski
(2002) derives another closed form, though in a non-stationary setting. Cochrane, Longstaﬀ
and Pedro Santa (forth.) contains nice closed form solutions. We confirm results from Mele
(2003, forth.), who obtains general results (particularly with one factor) for having bond and
stock prices that are convex, concave, or linear in the factors. LG processes satisfy Mele’s
conditions for linearity. Mele, however, did not derive the closed forms for stocks and bonds
in the linear case.
Linear expressions are in Bhattacharya (1978), Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (2004), Santos and Veronesi (2006), Buraschi and Jiltsov (2007).1 Their process turns out to be to
1

It is indeed the Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (2004) paper that alerted me to the possibility of a class

3

belong to the LG class (see Example 10). Indeed, we show that if processes yield linear expressions for bond prices, they belong to the LG class. In view of those earlier findings, the
present paper does two things. First, it defines and analyzes the unified class that underlines
disparate results of the literature (as Duﬃe and Kan did for aﬃne processes). Second, it proposes what appears to be some novel processes, such as those using the “linearity-generating
twist” (see Example 1, and many others).
Finally, we contribute to the vast literature on interest rate processes, by presenting a
new, flexible process. The main advantage is probably that, because the LG processes are so
easy to analyze, they lend themselves easily to economic analysis. As a secondary advantage,
they naturally exhibit “unspanned volatility”. Using the LG class, Gabaix (2007) develops
a model of stocks and bonds, and Farhi and Gabaix (2007) a model of exchange rates and
the forward premium puzzle.
This paper follows a productive literature that (proudly) reverse-engineers processes for
preferences and payoﬀs, e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Cox, Ingersoll, Ross (1985),
Pastor and Veronesi (2005), Ross (1978), Sims (1990), Liu (2007), and, particularly, Menzly,
Santos and Veronesi (2004). Indeed, the two LG moments conditions of Definition 1 gives a
recipe to “reverse-engineer” processes to ensure tractability.
Section 2 is a gentle introduction to LG processes. Section 3 presents the discrete-time
version of the process, and contains the main results of the paper. Section 4 presents the
continuous-time version of the LG process. The next sections are less essential. Section 5
studies the range of admissible initial conditions. Section 6 presents some additional results.
Section 7 concludes.
with closed forms for stocks. On the economic side, this article originates from a lunch with Robert Barro,
who was expressing the desirability of a model with stochastic probability of disaster (Gabaix 2007). That
conversation made me search for tractable ways to address this question, and led me to LG processes.

A simple introduction to linearity-generating processes

To motivate LG processes, this section presents a very simple, almost trivial example — the
Gordon formula in discrete time.2 We want to calculate the price:
"∞
#
X Dt+s
Pt = Et
(1 + r)s
s=0
of a stock with dividend growth:
Dt+1
= 1 + gt + εt+1
Dt

(1)

where εt+1 has mean 0, and gt is the trend growth rate of the stock, and we want it to
be autocorrelated (the i.i.d. case is trivial). This is a prototypical example of stock with
stochastic trend growth. Even in this example, the usual processes for gt typically give
untractable expressions, as they yield infinite sums of exponential terms.
Let us reverse engineer the process for gt , and see if the P/D ratio can have the form:
Pt
= A + Bgt
Dt
for some constants A and B. The arbitrage equation for the stock is Pt = Dt +
i.e.

(3)

Plugging in (1) and (2), and assuming that E [εt+1 ] = Et [εt+1 gt+1 ] = 0, the arbitrage
equation reads:
A + Bgt = 1 +
A + Bgt = 1 +

1+r

A
B
(1 + gt ) +
(1 + gt ) Et [gt+1 ]

(4)

This example is so simple that it would not be surprising if it had already been done elsewhere, even
though I did not find it in the previous literature. However, it seems quite certain that the class of LG
processes (including the general structure with several factors, stocks bonds and continuous time), as a class,
is identified and analyzed in the present paper for the first time.

5

If gt is an AR(1), i.e. Et [gt+1 ] = ρgt , then (4) cannot hold: we have linear terms on the
left-hand side, and non-linear terms on the right-hand side.
However, (4) can hold if we postulate that gt follows the following “twisted” AR(1), with
|ρ| < 1:
Linearity-generating twist: Et [gt+1 ] =

ρgt
1 + gt

(5)

If gt is close to 0, then to a first order, Et [gt+1 ] ∼ ρgt , so that gt+1 behaves approximately
like an AR(1). It’s a twisted AR(1), because of the term 1 +gt in the denominator. However,
in many applications, gt will be within a few percentage points from 0, so materially, the
twist is small (more on this later). If (5) holds, then (4) reads:
A + Bgt = 1 +

A
B
(1 + gt ) +
ρgt
1+r
1+r

which features only linear terms, and admits a solution. Indeed, we obtain A = 1+A/ (1 + r),
i.e. A = (1 + r) /r, and B = A/ (1 + r) + Bρ/ (1 + r), i.e. B = A/ (1 + r − ρ). Finally,
plugging those values of A and B back in (2) gives:
1+r
Pt

We conclude that (6) solves (3). It is actually easy to show that the stock price satisfies (6).

By induction on T , one shows that for all T ≥ 0, Et [Dt+T ] = 1 + 1−ρ gt Dt , and direct
calculation yields (6).

Example 1 (Simple stock example with LG stochastic trend growth rate) Consider a stock
with dividend growth rate gt , with Dt+1 /Dt = 1 + gt + εt+1 ,where εt+1 has mean 0 and is
uncorrelated with gt+1 , with the linearity-generating “twist” for the growth rate:

The rest of the paper develops this systematically.
This example illustrates many general traits of LG processes.
Eq. 7 imposes just one moment conditions. Higher order moments do not matter for the
price. For instance, we could have a complicated nonlinear function for the variance of the
growth rate, but it would not aﬀect the stock price. Likewise, the distribution of the noise
does not matter, so that one can have jumps and the like, without changing the price.
We need restrictions on the domain of gt . Mostly obviously, one needs gt > −1. Actually,
the stronger condition gt > ρ − 1 is needed (section 21) gives gt > ρ − 1. In particular, the
variance has to go to 0 near that boundary.

3

With the aﬃne models of Duﬃe and Kan (1996), we might model: Dt+1 /Dt = egt , gt+1 =
ρgt +εt+1 . That would lead to Et [Dt+T /Dt ] = ea(T )+b(T )gt , for some functions a (T ) , b (T ), and
P a(T )+b(T )gt
Pt
finally: D
=
e
(Burnside 1998, Ang and Liu 2004). We get a infinite sum over
t
maturities, rather than the compact expression (6). Hence, LG processes are particularly
tractable for stocks.
The twisted process (7) is similar to an AR(1), Et gt+1 = ρgt , up to second order terms.
Hence, the behavior is likely to be close to an AR(1). To illustrate this, the Online Appendix
to this paper reports the simulation of the above example, with and without the twisted
terms. The values for the growth rates are quite close (within 0.1 standard deviation of each
other), and hard to distinguish visually. Likewise, the associated price-dividend ratios are
quite close, and despite compounding, so are the dividend processes. Of course, even if they
had been quite diﬀerent, this would not have been a important drawback for LG processes.
We do not want to say that the true model is an AR(1), that a LG process approximates. It
could as well be that the true model is a LG process, than an AR(1) model approximates.
Or rather, as a model is just approximation of a complex economic reality, the respective
3

The reason is that the function g 7→ ρg/ (1 + g) has two fixed points, 0 and ρ − 1, and the process needs
to stay on the right side of the repelling fixed point, ρ − 1.

7

advantage of LG vs aﬃne models depends on the specific task at hand. The modeler should
be able to pick whichever modelling approximation is most expedient, and LG processes oﬀer
one such choice.
We now start our systematic treatment of LG processes. As several factors are needed
to capture the dynamics of stocks (Campbell and Shiller 1988, Fama and French 1996) and
bonds (Litterman and Scheinkman 1991), we study the multifactor case.

Linearity-generating processes in discrete time

This section studies the discrete-time LG processes. We want to price an asset with dividend
Dt , given a discount factor Mt .4 The"price at time t of
# a claim yielding a stochastic dividend
∞
X
Dt+T at maturity T ≥ 0 is: Pt = E
Mt+T Dt+T /Mt . For instance, the price at t of a
T =0

(“zero coupon”) bond yielding 1 in T periods is: Zt (T ) = Et [Mt+T ] /Mt .

3.1

Definition and main properties

The state vector is Xt ∈ Rn (n ∈ N∗ ) and can be generally thought of as stationary, while
Mt Dt generally trends, and is not stationary. The definition of the LG process is the following.
Definition 1 The process Mt Dt (1, Xt0 )t=0,1,2,... , with Mt Dt ∈ R∗ and Xt ∈ Rn , is a linearity-

generating process if there are constants α ∈ R, γ, δ ∈ Rn , Γ ∈ Rn×n , such that the following
relations hold at all t ∈ N:

∙

¸
Mt+1 Dt+1
= α + δ 0 Xt
Et
Mt Dt
∙
¸
Mt+1 Dt+1
Et
Xt+1 = γ + ΓXt
Mt Dt

(9)
(10)

P
−t
The simplest example is Mt = (1 + r) . If a consumer with utility t δ t U (Ct ) prices assets, then
Mt = δ t U 0 (Ct ). Also, some authors call “stochastic discount factor” Mt+1 /Mt . In this context, there is no
confusion.
4

8

To interpret (9), consider first the case of bonds, Dt ≡ 1. Eq. 9 says that the properly-

defined interest is linear in the factors. When Mt = (1 + r)−t , (9) says that expected dividend
growth is linear in the factors. In general, (9) means that the expected value of the (dividend
augmented) stochastic discount factor growth is linear in the factors.
Condition (10) mean that, Xt follows “twisted” AR(1). It behaves in some sense like
Mt+1 Dt+1
Mt Dt

Et [Xt+1 ] = γ + ΓXt , but it is twisted by the

term. Another useful interpretation

of (10) is that it specifies the factor dynamics under the risk-neutral measure induced by
Mt Dt .
What kinds of models are compatible with Definition 1? As the examples below show,
it is not diﬃcult to write toy economic models satisfying conditions (9)-(10), e.g. in Lucas
(1978) and Campbell-Cochrane (1999) economies with exogenous consumption, dividend or
marginal utility processes, or models with learning. Farhi and Gabaix (2007) and Gabaix
(2007) presents a fully worked-out economic model satisfying the conditions of Definition 1.
Indeed, conditions (9)-(10) give a prescription to “reverse-engineer” macro or micro fundamentals, so as to make the model tractable: The modeler has to make sure that the
endowment, technology etc. is such that (9)-(10) hold.
In addition, models that to not directly fit into the conditions of Definition 1, could be
approximated by projected linearly in (9)-(10). Also, by extending the state vector, equations
(9)-(10) could hold to an arbitrary degree of precision. The Online Appendix to this paper
illustrates how to approximate a non-LG process with an LG process, even to an arbitrary
degree of precision.
There is a more compact way to think about LG processes. Define the (n + 1) × (n + 1)
matrix, which we will call the “generator” of the process:

so that with vector ν 0 = (1, 0, ..., 0),

Yt stacks all the information relevant to the prices of the claims derived below.

5

Conditions

(9)-(10) can be written:
(14)

Et [Yt+1 ] = ΩYt .

Hence, the (dividend-augmented) stochastic discount factor of a LG process is simply the
projection (Eq. 13) of an autoregressive process, Yt . The tractability of LG processes comes
from the tractability of autoregressive processes.
The basic pricing properties are the following two Theorems.
Theorem 1 (Bond prices, discrete time) The price-dividend ratio of a zero-coupon equity
or bond of maturity T , Zt (T ) = Et [Mt+T Dt+T ] / (Mt Dt ), is

Zt (T ) =

where In the identity matrix of dimension n, and 0n is the row vector with n zeros.
For instance, when Dt ≡ 1, the above Theorem can price bonds, with n factors, in closed
form.
In many applications (e.g., the examples in this paper), γ = 0, which means the state
variables are re-centered around 0. For instance, the state variable is the deviation of the

equity premium from its trend value.
The second main result is the most useful property of LG processes: the existence of a
closed-form formula for stock prices.
Theorem 2 (Stock prices, discrete time) Suppose that all eigenvalues of Ω have a modulus
less than 1 (finiteness of the price). Then, the price-dividend ratio of the stock, Pt /Dt =

Theorem 2 allows to generate stock prices with an arbitrary number of factors, including

Et [xt+1 ] = ρxt . Instead, the process is slightly modified, to (24), to make the process LG.
Indeed, with Mt = (1 + r)−t , and using the notation 1 + R = (1 + r) / (1 + g∗ ), we calculate

gt , do the same for πt = π ∗ + π
bt ,
and postulate the following processes:

1 + g∗ − π ∗
ρ (gt − g∗ ) + εgt+1
1 + gt − π t g
1 + g∗ − π∗
= π∗ +
ρ (π t − π∗ ) + επt+1
1 + gt − πt π

gt+1 = g∗ +
πt+1

where at time t εgt+1 and επt+1 have expected values 0 and are uncorrelated with η t+1 .The
term

1+gt −πt

will be close to 1 in many applications. Defining: α = (1 + g∗ − π ∗ ) / (1 + r),

This equation nests the three main sources of variations of stock prices in a simple and
natural way. Stock prices can increase because the level of dividends increases (that’s the Dt
terms), because the expected future growth rate of dividend increases (the gt − g∗ term), or
because the equity premium decreases (the π t −π ∗ terms). The two growth or discount factors
(gt and π t ) enter linearly, weighted by their duration (e.g., 1/ (R + φπ )), which depends on
7

The risk premium is on the innovations to dividends. One could also have a risk premium on the
innovation to dividend growth rate (as in Bansal and Yaron 2004), an exercise that we leave to the reader.

the speed of mean-reversion of the each process (parametrized by φπ , φg ), and the eﬀective
discount rate, R. The volatility terms do not enter in (27), and the price does not change if
one changes the correlation between the instantaneous innovation in gt and π t .

Example 5 Markov chains, and some economies with learning
There are n states. In state i the factor-augmented dividend grows at a rate Gi : Mt+1 Dt+1 / (Mt Dt ) =
Gi . Call Xit ∈ {0, 1}, equal to 1 if the state is i, 0 otherwise. The probability of going from
state j to state i is called pij . Then, Mt Dt (1, X1 , ..., Xn ) is a LG process. Hence, a Markov
chain belongs to the LG class.8 As many processes are (arbitrarily) well-approximated by
discrete Markov chains, they are (arbitrarily) well-approximated by LG processes.
Markov chains induced by learning naturally lead to LG processes. For a complete
example, the reader is encouraged to read Veronesi (2005). He finds that if Xit is the agents’
probability estimate that the economy is in state i, under canonical models with Gaussian
filtration of information, then vector Xt follows an autoregressive process. He works out
the prices of stocks and bonds in an economy, and finds that they are linear function of Xt .
Hence, some canonical structural with learning models naturally give rise to LG processes.

with Et [εt+1 ] = 0, Et η t+1 = 0. Then, Eq. 9-10 are satisfied. Section 5 provides conditions

to ensure Mt Dt > 0 for all times.

£
¤
To interpret (31), consider the case γ = Et εt+1 η t+1 = 0. Eq. 31 expresses that, when

Xt is small, Et [Xt+1 ] =

ΓXt
a+β 0 Xt

∼ Γa xt , which means that Xt follows approximately at AR(1).

The corrective 1 + β 0 /a · Xt in the denominator is often small in practice, but ensures that
the process is LG.

£
¤
In many applications, there is no risk premium on the factor risk, so that Et εt+1 η t+1 =

0. However, when there is a risk-premium equation (31) means that it is enough to know
that the process under the “risk-neutral” measure.
8

Veronesi and Yared (2000) and David and Veronesi (2006) have already seen that this type of Markov
chain yielded prices that are linear in the factors.

16

We next turn to the continuous time version of what we have seen so far.

4

Linearity-generating processes in continuous time

¡
¢
We fix a probability space ΩP , F, P and an information filtration Ft satisfying the usual

technical conditions (see, for example, Karatzas and Shreve 1991). The stochastic discount
factor is Mt . For applications, we will express the results in terms of a dividend-augmented

stochastic discount factor, Mt Dt . Often, it is better to imagine Dt ≡ 1.

4.1

Definition and main properties

A notation. The following notation is useful when using LG processes. For xt , μt processes
in a vector space V , we say Et [dxt ] = μt dt, or Et [dxt ] /dt = μt , to signify that there exists
Rt
a martingale Nt with values in V such that: xt = x0 + 0 μs ds + Nt .

The definition in continuous time is analogous to the definition in discrete time. The

vector of factors is Xt .
Definition 2 The process Mt Dt (1, Xt )0t∈R+ , with Mt Dt ∈ R and Xt ∈ Rn , is a linearity-

generating process if there are constants with a ∈ R, b, β ∈ Rn , Φ ∈ Rn×n , such that the
following relations hold at all t ∈ R+ ,
Et [d (Mt Dt )] = − (a + β 0 Xt ) Mt Dt dt

(32)

Et [d (Mt Dt Xt )] = − (b + ΦXt ) Mt Dt dt

(33)

The interpretation is exactly the same as for Definition 1. Eq. 32 means that the expected
growth rate of Mt Dt is linear in the factors. Eq. 33 means that Xt follows a twisted AR(1).
Loosely speaking, it describes the process for Xt under the “risk-neutral” measure induced
by Mt Dt .
For instance, in the case Dt ≡ 1 and dMt /Mt = − (a + β 0 Xt ) dt, Eq. 33 gives:
dXt = −bdt − (Φ − aIn ) Xt dt + (β 0 Xt ) Xt dt + dNt
17

(34)

where Nt ∈ Rn is a martingale. Hence, the process contains an AR(1) term, −b−(Φ − aIn ) Xt ,
plus a “twist” quadratic term, (β 0 Xt ) Xt . It is a “twisted” AR(1). In many applications, Xt

represents a small deviation from trend, and the quadratic term (β 0 Xt ) Xt is small. We are
agnostic about how empirically relevant the “twist” is. It could be that it is absent in the
physical probability, but present under the risk-neutral measure.
So Et [dNt ] = 0, but its components dNit , dNjt can be correlated. The simplest type of
martingale is dNt = σ (Xt ) dBt , for Bt a Brownian motion, but richer structures, e.g. with
jumps, are allowed. As in the one-factor process, the volatility of dNt must go to zero in
some limit regions for the process to be well-defined. We defer this more technical issue until
section 5.
As in the discrete-time case, we define the “generator” of the process:
⎛

⎛

and the process Yt = ⎝

Mt Dt

⎞

ω=⎝

⎠

(35)

⎠ ∈ Rn+1 , as in (12), which encodes the information

Mt Dt Xt
needed for prices. Conditions (32)-(33) write more compactly as:
Et [dYt ] = −ωYt dt.

(36)

which is the analogue of (14). The above process leads to a LG discrete-time process with
time increments ∆t, with a generator Ω = e−ω∆t .
Hence, there is a (n + 1) dimensional process Yt , and a vector ν 0 = (1, 0, ..., 0), such
that (36) holds, and Mt = ν 0 Yt . In other terms, there is a autoregressive process Yt in
the background, following (36). The (dividend-augmented) stochastic discount factor is the
one-dimensional projection of it. LG processes are tractable, because they are the onedimensional projection of an AR(1) process.
The next Theorem prices claims of finite maturity.

As an example, bond prices come from Dt = 1. In many applications, b = 0, which can
generically be obtained by re-centering the variables.

The result in Example 7 appear new to the literature. The Fisher-Wright process does contain a quadratic
term, but it has not been applied to the pricing bonds or stocks. Also, it is more special than the LG class,
because it imposes a specific functional form on the variance. Cochrane, Longstaﬀ, and Santa-Clara (forth.)
apply the Fisher-Wright process. Mele (2003, forth.) identifies a condition for the process to be linear in the
factor, but does not derive stocks and bond prices such as (48). Other papers introduce diﬀerent quadratic
terms in stochastic process, for instance Ahn et al. (2002), and Constantidines (1992) but they do not take
the form of this paper.
10
The formula suggests the following non-LG variant. Suppose we have a process with dψ t =
(rt ψ t + αrt − β) dt+dNt ,where dNt is an adapted martingale, and is essentially arbitrary except for technical
conditions. Then Vt = (ψ t + α) /β is a solution of the perpetuity arbitrage equation: 1−rt Vht +E [dVt ] /dt = 0.
i
R ∞ Us
If the process well-defined for t ≥ 0, then Vt is the price of a perpetuity, Vt = Et t e− t ru du ds .
For instance, with the process d (1/rt ) = φ (rt − r∗ ) dt + dNt , the price of a perpetuity is: Vt =
(1/rt + φ/r∗ ) / (1 + φ).

Example 10 The aggregate model of Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (2004), and the Bhattacharya (1978) mean-reverting process, belong to the linearity-generating class.
The following point is simple and formal. Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (MSV, 2004)
rely on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck. The inverse of their consumption-surplus ratio, yt , follows:
¤
£R ∞
Et [dyt ] = k (y − yt ) dt. The price-consumption ratio in their economy is Vt = yt−1 Et 0 e−ρs yt+s ds .
In terms of the LG process, the state variable is yt , and Mt = e−ρt . We have Et [dMt /dt] /Mt =
−ρdt, and⎛Et [d (Mt yt ) /dt]⎞/Mt = −ρyt + k (y − yt ). So Mt (1, yt ) is a LG process with generρ

0

⎠. The MSV pricing equation 17 comes directly from Proposition
−kY ρ + k
4 of the present article, yt Vt = (ky + ρyt ) / [ρ (ρ + k)]. Hence, in retrospect, the MSV (2004)
ator ω = ⎝

process is tractable because it belongs to the LG class. This remark, also, immediately
suggest a way to formulate the MSV paper to discrete time. In a simpler context, Bhattacharya (1978) models the dividend yt as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, yielding the same closed
form solution for the price.
Example 11 A LG process where the stock price is convex (not linear) in the growth rate
of dividends
This “academic” example shows how one can obtain asset prices that are increasing in
their variance, which is important in some applications (Johnson 2002, Pastor and Veronesi
2003). Consider an economy with constant discount rate r (i.e. Mt = e−rt ), and a stock with
³R
´
p
t
dividend Dt = D0 exp 0 gs ds , where12 dgt = − (gt2 /2 + φgt ) dt + k (G2 − g2 )dzt . Then,
the price-dividend ratio is:

Pt /Dt =

2(φ + r)(2φ + k + r) + 2(2φ + k + r)gt + gt2
2r (φ + r) (2φ + k + r) − kG2

(51)

which is increasing in the parameter G of the volatility. In this example, the state vector
is (gt , gt2 ), which makes the price quadratic and convex in gt . More generally, by expanding
the state vector, the price could be a polynomial of arbitrary order in g.
We next present some bond-like examples. We start with a very simple example.
12

We assume 0 < G < 2 (φ − k), and that the support of gt is (−G, G), with end points natural boundaries.

23

Example 12 A one-factor bond model, with an always positive nominal rate.
The following example is simply illustrates LG processes. It has just one factor, whereas
³ R
´
t
multifactor models are necessary to capture the yield curve. Suppose Mt = exp − 0 rs ds ,
with rt = r∗ + rbt , with

db
rt = − (φ − rbt ) rbt dt + dNt

where φ > 0, rbt ≤ φ, and Nt is a martingale, which could include a diﬀusive part and a jump
part. The bond price is:

−r∗ T

Zt (T ) = e

rbt .
φ

(52)

The independence of bond prices from volatility greatly simplifies the analysis. In particular, dNt could have jumps, which model a decision by the central bank, or fat-tailed
innovations of other kinds (Gabaix et al. 2006). One does not need to specify the volatility
process to obtain the prices of bonds: only the drift part is necessary. This leaves a high
margin of flexibility to calibrate volatility, for instance on interest rate derivatives, a topic
we do not pursue here.
How can we ensure that the interest rate always remains positive? That is very easy
(with r∗ > 0). For instance, we could have dNt = σ (rt ) dzt , where zt is a Brownian process,
0

with σ (r) ∼ k0 rκ , κ0 > 1/2 for r in a right neighborhood of 0, and k0 > 0, so that the
local drift at rt = 0 is positive. By the usual Feller conditions on natural boundaries, the
process admits a strong solution, and rt ≥ 0 always (Cheridito and Gabaix 2007 spell out
the technical conditions). And, the bond price (52) is not changed by this assumption about
the volatility process. One can indeed change the lower bound for the process (if it is less
than r∗ ) without changing the bond price.
Section 5 will detail the conditions for the existence of the process. The interest rate
needs to remains below some upper bound r ∈ (r∗ , r∗ + φ], so as to not explode. One way is

to assume that σ (r) ∼ k (r − r)κ , for r in a left neighborhood of r, κ > 1/2 and k > 0. Given
the drift is negative around r, that will ensure that r is a natural boundary, and {∀t, rt ≤ r}

almost surely, as detailed in Cheridito and Gabaix (2007). We next turn to the canonical
LG bond case.
Example 13 A multifactor bond model, with bond risk premia (continuous time).
24

The following is Example 4 in continuous time. Suppose dMt /Mt = −rt dt + dNt , where
P
Nt is a martingale, and decompose the short rate in rt = r∗ + ni=1 rit , with r∗ a constant

and:

Et [drit ] + hdrit , dMt /Mt i = [−φi rit + (rt − r∗ ) rit ] dt

(53)

where we use the notation hdxt , dyt i is the usual bracket, e.g. hσ 1 · dBt , σ 2 · dBt i = σ 1 · σ 2
dt.
Hence, it is enough to specify the process “under the risk-neutral measure”. One does not
need to separately specify the dynamics of Et [drit ] and its risk premium, the hdrit , dMt /Mt i
term. Only the sum matters. The process Mt (1, r1t , ..., rnt ) is LG13 , and the bond price is

Conditions to keep the process well-defined

The results of this paper require that the process be defined for t ≥ 0, and in particular
that Mt Dt > 0, which ensures the above-derived prices are positive. This section provide
simple suﬃcient conditions to ensure that. They are meant to be practical and easy to verify.
Cheridito and Gabaix (2007) provide more abstract and general conditions.

5.1

Discrete time
ρg +σ(g )η

We start with Example 1. We want the process to be well-defined. Write gt+1 = t 1+gtt t+1 ,
£
¤
with Et η t+1 = 0 and σ (gt ) ≥ 0. First, take the case where there is no noise, ∀t, η t+1 = 0.

The application g 7→ ρg/ (1 + g) has two fixed points, an attractive one g = 0, and a repelling

one that, g = ρ − 1. To ensure that the process is economically meaningful, we require that
g0 be on the right side of the repelling point, g0 > ρ − 1. That will ensure (when there is no
noise) that for all t ≥ 0, gt > ρ − 1, and in particular gt > −1. If g0 < ρ − 1, then for some
time t, gt < −1, not a meaningful economic outcome. In conclusion, in the deterministic
growth rate case, we want to impose
gt > g = ρ − 1.

(56)

When the growth rate is stochastic, we want that for all gt+1 > ρ−1, i.e. gt +σ (gt ) η t+1 >
g. This is possible if η t+1 has a lower bound, and the volatility σ (g) goes to 0 fast enough
near the boundary g, a fact formalized in the next Lemma.
Lemma 1 (Conditions of existence of the process in the 1-dimensional, discrete time case).
£
¤
g +σ(g )η
Consider the process in Example 1: gt+1 = t 1+gt t t+1 , with Et η t+1 = 0. Assume that (i)
there is an m > 0 such that, almost surely, for all t, η t+1 > −m ; and (ii) 0 ≤ σ (g) ≤

g−g
,
m

i.e. the volatility goes to 0 fast enough close to g = ρ − 1. Suppose g0 > g. Then, almost
surely, for all t ≥ 0, gt > g, and the process is defined for all times t.
The principle generalizes to several factors. Consider the discrete-time case where the

26

generator Ω is of the form (??), with α > 0 and α > Γi for all i, and γ = 0.14 Parametrize
the noise in (14) by Yt+1 = ΩYt + Yt0 ut+1 , where Et [ut+1 ] = 0. The n−factor generalization
of the criterion (56) above is the following:
Proposition 5 (Condition to ensure a well-behaved process, with positive stochastic discount
factor, discrete time) Suppose that M0 D0 > 0, and that at t = 0, X0 satisfies:
Condition C at time t (discrete time): 1 +

n
X
min (δ i Xit /α, 0)
i=1

1 − Γi /α

>0

(57)

Suppose also that the noise ut+1 is bounded and goes to 0 fast enough near the boundary of
(57). Then, for all times t ≥ 0, Mt Dt > 0, so that the process is well-defined, and prices
Et [Mt+T Dt+T ] are positive. In addition, for all times t, Xt satisfies the condition (57).
The first part of the Proposition implies that, if the noise is small enough, then all prices
derived above will be positive. The second part, means that if Condition C is satisfied at
t = 0, then it will be satisfied for all future t’s. This “self-perpetuating” property makes it
potentially useful for applied work.
Condition C means δ i Xit terms should not be too negative. It means that growth rates
terms should not be too low, and interest rate terms should not be too high. This makes
sense, because, in view of (19), if the terms δ i Xit are too negative, then prices could be
threaten to be negative.
To illustrate this, consider first Example 2. Then, δ = 1, α = 1/ (1 + R), Γ1 = ρα, and
the condition reads: 1+min (xt , 0) / (1 − ρ) > 0, i.e. xt > 1−ρ. This is exactly the condition
(56) derived above. The deviation of the growth rate from trend cannot be too low.
Next, consider Example 4. Then, α = 1/ (1 + r∗ ), δ = α (−1, ..., −1), and Γ = α (ρ1 , ..., ρn ).

(58)

This case is not very restrictive, as more general case can be reduced to it by diagonalization, if Ω is
diagonalizable in R.

27

This condition means that the components of the interest rate state vector cannot be too
positive. Each component is weighted by its duration 1/ (1 − ρi ), i.e. more persistent components count for more.

¡
¢
Finally, consider the hybrid Example 3. The condition reads: 1+min (gt − g∗ , 0) / 1 − ρg −

max (π t − π ∗ , 0) / (1 − ρπ ) > 0. This means that the growth rate should not be too low, or
the risk premium should not be too high.

5.2

Continuous time

The same condition carries over to continuous time. In the case where ω is equal to (41)
with b = 0, and a < Φi for all i, the condition is:
n
X
max (β i Xit /a, 0)
>0
Condition C at time t (continuous time): 1 −
Φi − a
i=1

(59)

For instance, for the simple growth model of Example 7, we have Xt = gt , a = r, β = −1,
Φ = φ + r, so Condition C gives: 1 − max (−gt , 0) /φ > 0, i.e. gt > −φ, the continuous time
limit of (56).
Likewise, for the interest rate model of Example 12, the condition is rbt < φ. The interest

rate should not be too high.

In the multi-factor model of Example 13, a = r∗ , β = 1, Φi = r∗ + φi , so the Condition
P
is: 1 − ni=1 max (rit , 0) /φi > 0, which is just the continuous time analogue of (58).
This conclude our simple, practical suﬃcient conditions for processes to be well-defined.

More abstract and general conditions are provided in Cheridito and Gabaix (2007).

Extensions

This section presents additional results and remarks on LG processes.

6.1

LG processes are the only ones that generate linearity

We show that, in a certain sense, if bond prices are linear in the factors, then they come
from an LG process. To see that, let us first consider the 1-factor case. Call Xt the factor,
and suppose that for T = 1, 2, Zt (T ) = αT + β T Xt , for some numbers α1 , β 1 6= 0, α2 , β 2 .
With T = 1, we get Et [Mt+1 /Mt ] = α1 + β 1 xt , so that condition (9) holds. Also,

hence (10) holds. We conclude that if both the 1 and 2-period maturity bonds are aﬃne in
Xt , then Mt (1, Xt ) is a LG process. The next Proposition shows that the property holds
with n factors15

process, i.e. there is a matrix Ω, such that Yt = Mt (1, Xt )0 follows: Et [Yt+1 ] = ΩYt .

6.2

Relation to the aﬃne-yield class

The aﬃne class (Duﬃe and Kan 1996; Dai and Singleton 2000; Duﬃe, Pan and Singleton
2000; Duﬀee 2002; Cheridito, Filipovic and Kimmel 2007) is a very important class, that
contains the processes of Vasicek and Cox, Ingersoll, Ross (1985). It is a workhorse of
much empirical and theoretical in asset pricing. It comprises processes of the type: dXt =
The property that {(αT , β T ) , T = 1, 2..} spans Rn+1
means that Et [Mt+T /Mt ] = αT + β 0T Xt is the

Rn×n × Rn×n×n , σ ∈ R, zt is a n−dimensional Brownian motion. The interest rate is rt =

r∗ + β 0 (Xt − X∗ ), where X∗ = Φ−1 b, is assumed to exist. Under mild technical conditions,

bond prices have the expression:
¡
¢
ZtAﬀ (T ) = exp −r∗ T + Γ (T )0 (Xt − X∗ ) + σ 2 a (T ) ,
where a (T ) and Γ (T ) satisfy coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations, that typically need
to be solved numerically. This is not a problem for empirical work, but that does hinder
theoretical work. The situation is simpler if H1 = 0. In that case, Γ (T ) = γ (T ), with
¢
¡
¢
¡
γ (T )0 = β 0 e−ΦT − 1 /Φ. Then: ZtAﬀ (T ) = exp −r∗ T + γ (T )0 (Xt − X∗ ) + σ 2 a (T ) . This
expression can be contrasted with the expression for the LG process (38),
¢
¡
ZtLG (T ) = e−r∗ T 1 + γ (T )0 (Xt − X∗ ) .

(60)

If γ (T )0 Xt is small, the two expressions are the same, up to terms of second order in γ (T )0 Xt ,
and second order in σ. Hence, a LG process is a good approximation if the underlying process
is in fact aﬃne, and vice-versa. In most cases, the two values are likely to be close, so that
existing estimates of parameters in the aﬃne class can be used to calibrate LG processes.16
What are the respective merits of the LG and aﬃne classes? First, quantitatively, they
will often make close predictions, as the two models yield the same prices to a first order. Hence, for many situations, the choice of aﬃne vs LG processes is just a matter of
convenience.
In terms of the economic diﬀerences, as LG bond prices are independent of volatility
(controlling for the covariances, see Eq. 54), LG processes generate “unspanned volatility,”
a relevant feature of the data, as shown by Collin-Dufresne and Goldstein (2002), Andersen
and Benzoni (2007) and Joslin (2007). By contrast, aﬃne models typically impose a tight
16

That equivalence gives a useful way to calculate easily functionals of LG processes, that can be expressed
as a linear combination of bonds. One first works with the aﬃne process, setting volatility to 0, doing a
first order Taylor
of terms in (Xt − X∗ ). One gets an expression: PtAﬀ = a + b (Xt − X∗ ) +
¡ 2expansion
¢
o (Xt − X∗ ) + o σ , for some constant a, b. Then, one knows that for the corresponding LG process, the
value of the asset is: PtLG = a + b (Xt − X∗ ), exactly.

link between bond prices and volatility.
On the other hand, a potential drawback of pricing bonds with the LG process, is that,
in the simplest version at least, bonds have no mechanically-induced convexity in the LG
framework. However, this may not be such a problem, as Joslin (2007) estimates that bond
convexity plays a small role in bond prices. In addition, multifactor LG processes can have
some convexity (Example 11).
Coming now to the diﬀerence in terms of tractability, the distinctive advantage of the
LG class is for stocks. LG yield simple closed forms for stock prices. However, with the
P
Aﬀ
aﬃne class, a stock price can be only be expressed PtAﬀ /Dt = ∞
t=0 Zt (T ) (Burnside 1998,

Ang and Liu 2004). Those are infinite sums of exponentials, which is a great progress over
stochastic sums, but are still not very tractable.
Beyond their advantage for stocks, LG processes have two lesser virtues. First, bond
prices are quite simple, which should prove useful to theorize on bonds (Gabaix 2007).
Second, LG processes allow a free functional form for the innovations dNt , which can include
jumps and non-Gaussian behavior, and a free type of heteroskedascity.
On the other hand, aﬃne processes are the central technique to price derivatives, whereas
this paper is silent about options (pricing options with LG processes is an open challenge).
Finally, aﬃne models are now well-understood, and they have been estimated. It would be
very desirable to do the same for LG models (see Binsbergen and Koijen 2007)
In conclusion, LG processes have a good advantage for stocks, and aﬃne processes have
a strong advantage for options. For bonds, aﬃne models will continue to be tremendously
useful, but LG models may complement them, particularly in theoretical research.

Closedness under addition and multiplication

The product of two uncorrelated LG processes is LG. The product of two uncorrelated LG processes with respective dimensions d1 , d2 (i.e., with d1 − 1 and d2 − 1 factor
respectively) is LG, with dimension d1 d2 (i.e., with d1 d2 − 1 factors). The idea is simple,
though it requires somewhat heavy notations.
We start in discrete time. Take two LG processes characterized by Mti , Yti , Ωi , and consider a process with discount factor Mt = Mt1 Mt2 . Assume that, for any index i, j of the com³
´
1(i)
2(j)
ponents, cov Yt+1 , Yt+1 = 0. The innovations between processes are uncorrelated, but,

importantly, not necessarily independent. Then, it is easy to verify that for any vector ψ i ,
£¡
¢¡
¢¤
£
¤ £
¤
Et ψ 1 YT1 ψ 2 YT2 = Et ψ 2 YT2 Et ψ 2 YT2 . In particular, Et [MT1 MT2 ] = Et [MT1 ] Et [MT2 ].

Then, Mt = Mt1 Mt2 is also the stochastic discount factor of a LG process. The underlying
1

2

1(i)

2(j)

autoregressive process is Y t ⊗ Y t , i.e. the vector made of the d1 d2 components Y t Y t

,

i = 1...d1 , j = 1...d2 . The corresponding generator Ω is Ω = Ω1 ⊗ Ω2 .

The same reasoning holds in continuous time. Starting with processes Mti , Yti , ω i , and
D
E
1(i)
1(2)
assuming dYt+1 , dYt+1 = 0, then Mt1 Mt2 is also a pricing kernel that comes from a LG
1

2

process. The underlying autoregressive process is Y t ⊗ Y t (which has dimension d1 d2 ), and

it is easy to check that the generator is: ω = ω1 ⊗ Id2 + Id1 ⊗ ω 2 . To make the above concrete,
consider the following example.
Example 15 Stock with decoupled LG processes for the growth rate and the risk premium.
Consider processes with dMt /Mt = −rt − λt dBt , dDt /Dt = gt dt + σ t dBt , where gt

follows: dgt = −φg (gt − g∗ ) dt − (gt − g∗ )2 dt + dNtg , and the risk premium, π t = λt σ t ,

follows: dπ t = −φπ (π t − π ∗ ) dt+(π t − π∗ )2 dt+dNtπ , where Ntg , Ntπ are martingales. Assume

that the processes dNtg , dNtπ and dBt are uncorrelated. Then, the price of a stock, Pt =

For general processes, the above equation would in general require the two processes to
be independent — for instance, with stochastic volatility, the respective variance processes

should be independent. For LG processes, the property required is the weaker hdπ t , dgt i = 0
for all t’s.
Using the values of the LG processes, and integrating, we obtain, with R = r + π∗ − g∗ ,17

(61)

The central value is again the Gordon formula, Pt /Dt = 1/R. It is modified by the current
level of the equity premium, and the growth rate of the stock. A stock with a currently high
growth rate gt exhibits a higher price-dividend ratio, and this is amplified when the equity
premium is low, as shown by the term (π t − π ∗ ) (gt − g∗ ).
The diﬀerence between formula (61) and formula (50) is that in (61), the processes for π t
and gt are decoupled, whereas in (50), they were coupled, i.e. in their drift term there was a
term (gt − g∗ ). The decoupling forces the presence of a cross term (π t − π ∗ ) (gt − g∗ ) in the
expression of the price. In general, one obtains simpler expressions by having one multifactor
LG processes, rather than the product of many diﬀerent LG processes. With n coupled
factors, the stock price has n + 1 terms, while with n decoupled factors, the stock price has
2n terms.
The sum of two LG processes is LG. This property is quite trivial, and mentioned
for completeness. Suppose two LG process Mti , Yti , Ωi , with Mti = ν i Yti , for i = 1, 2. Call di
the dimension of Yti . Then, Mt = Mt1 + Mt2 comes from

Conclusion

Linearity-generating processes are very tractable, as they yield closed forms for stocks and
bonds, and prices that are linear in factors. They are likely to be useful in several parts of
17

Menzly, Santos and Veronesi (2004, Eq. 20) obtain a similar expression. This is natural because the LG
class embeds their model, as Example 10 shows.

33

economics, when trend growth rates, or risk premia, are time-varying. The results of this
paper suggest the following research directions.
Most importantly, LG processes allow the construction of paper and pencil tractable
general equilibrium models, with closed forms for stocks and bonds. Indeed they suggest a
way to “reverse engineer” the processes for endowments and technology, so that the model
is tractable. Gabaix (2007) and Farhi and Gabaix (2007) present such models.
Second, it would be good to use the flexibility and closed forms of LG processes for
empirical work. In an ambitious new paper, Binsbergen and Koijen (2007) take up this task,
and demonstrate the fruitfulness of having closed forms for multifactor models. Also, since
the LG processes are defined by moment conditions (Eq. 9-10), they lend themselves to
estimation and testing by GMM techniques.
Third, LG processes suggest a new way to linearize models. Given a model, one could do a
Taylor expansion expressing moments Et [Mt+1 Dt+1 /Mt Dt ] and Et [Mt+1 Dt+1 Xt+1 /Mt Dt ] as
a linear function of the factors, thereby making Eq. 9-10 hold to a first order approximation.
The projected model is then in the LG class, and its asset prices are approximations of the
prices of the initial problem. Hence the LG class oﬀers a way to derive linear approximations
of the asset prices of more complicated models. The Online Appendix to this paper studies
such an example, where a non-LG process can be approximated by an LG process to an
arbitrary degree of precision.
Fourth, LG processes can be enriched by a decision variable, and oﬀer a way to do
multifactor, closed-form dynamic programming. I explore those issues in ongoing research.
I conclude that LG processes might be a useful addition to the economist’s toolbox.

In the case t = 0 (which is enough), the proof is thus: define f (T ) = E0 [YT ]. Then, df (T ) = E0 [dYT ] =
E0 [−ωYT dT ] = −ωE0 [YT ] dT = −ωf (T ) dT , which integrates to f (T ) = e−ωT f (0), i.e. E0 [YT ] = e−ωT Y0 .
20
The following elementary heuristic proof is useful to know. We seek a solution of the type Pt /Dt ≡ Vt =
c + h0 Xt , which we know exists, by integration of (37). The arbitrage equation is: 1 − rt Vt + E [dVt ] /dt = 0,

Given Ω, this means Y0,t+1 = αY0t + i δ i Yit , and for i ≥ 1, Yi,t+1 = Γi Yi,t . So:

Hence, Ht+1 ≥ αHt . Hence, if H0 > 0, then ∀t ≥ 0, Ht > 0, and so that Mt Dt = Y0t ≥
Ht > 0.
In the case with noise, say that Yt+1 = ΩYt + ut+1 , for some mean 0 noise ut+1 , and
suppose that ut+1 is bounded. By continuity, if Ht > 0, Ht+1 is positive with probability 1,
if ut+1 is small enough. And again, Mt Dt = Y0t ≥ Ht > 0.
Proof of Proposition 6 Call Yt = Mt (1, Xt )0 , γ T = (αT , β T )0 , so that Et [Mt+T ] =
γ 0T Yt . That implies γ 0T +1 Yt = Et [Mt+T +1 ] = Et [Et+1 [Mt+T +1 ]] = Et [γ T Yt+1 ], hence: γ 0T +1 Yt =
Et [γ T Yt+1 ].

Online Appendix for “Linearity-Generating Processes: A
Modelling Tool Yielding Closed Forms for Asset Prices”
Xavier Gabaix
September 10, 2007
This online Appendix discusses a few additional issues related to LG processes. The
first section discusses how to approximate non-LG processes with LG processes. The second section illustrates the diﬀerence between non-LG and LG processes, to see to what
extent the quadratic terms makes a diﬀerence. The discussion uses heuristic arguments, and
simulations.
This online Appendix contains ideas that might be profitably developed in further papers,
notably that theme that LG processes might oﬀer a way to arbitrarily approximate non-LG
processes.

Approximating non-LG processes with LG processes

LG processes oﬀer a way to approximate the price of stocks and bonds with non-LG processes,
often to an arbitrary degree of precision. This section illustrates this in a particular example.
The general properties of approximation with LG processes would require a full paper, but the
present appendix simply illustrates that a preliminary investigation justifies being optimistic.
We suppose that the dividend growth (de-trended) follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

First-order approximation

We define Yt1 = e−Rt Dt , and Yt2 = e−Rt Dt gt . We have: Et [dY1,t ] /dt = (−R + gt ) Y1,t =
−RY1,t + Y2,t and dY2,t /dt = Y1,t (− (φ + R) gt + gt2 ).

To approximate gt2 , we replace it by its steady state mean. To find it, we observe that

Et [dgt2 ] /dt = −2φgt2 +σ 2 , so that taking the expectation at time 0, we obtain limt→∞ E0 [gt2 ] =
σ 2 / (2φ). Hence we approximate dY2,t ' Y1,t (− (φ + R) gt + σ 2 / (2φ)). Hence we approxi-

mate Yt by Yt∗ , where

Figure 1 plots the LG approximation, and the exact expression. We find only a small
discrepancy (less than 2%) between the two expressions. We conclude that the first order
approximation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process by a LG process will be rather good, and
useful for theoretical purposes. If the goal is high-level numerical accuracy, we turn to an
approximation of arbitrary order.

8.2
8.2.1

Approximation of arbitrary order
A simple truncation

In some examples, and perhaps virtually always (at least, when the processes defining the
functions are analytic), it is possible to make LG processes approximate the prices of non-LG
processes to an arbitrary degree of precision. We provide a simple illustration of this. Define

Figure 1: The Figure plots the true value of the P/D ratio of a stock with an OrnsteinUhlenbeck process (solid line, Eq. 63), and the approximation by a LG process with n = 1
factor (short dashed line, Eq. 64), and n = 2 factors (longer dashed line, Eq. 71). The
annualized values are: R = 5%, σ = 1%, φ = 15%. In the range of the Figure, the 1-factor
approximation is within 2% of the true value, while the 2-factor approximation is withinn
0.15% of the true value. The 2-factor approximation is so close to true value that it is hard
to distinguish visually.
Yit = e−rt Dt gti−1 for i = 1, 2, .... Hence, the vector of factors is Xt = (gt , gt2 , gt3 , ...). We have:

(65)

The sum can be truncated up to step n, i.e. be take to be the restriction of the vector to
the first n dimensions. We compare the LG (65) to the exact expression (113). Numerical
results show that the approximation is very good, even for n = 5.
8.2.2

An improved truncation

There is a better way to truncate the expansion (65). This section is heuristic, not rigorous.
To study the “pure” behavior of the process, with the eﬀect of discounting, we look at the
process when r = 0. Then:
Et [dY2,t ] /dt = −φY2t + Y3t

(66)

Et [dY3t ] /dt = σ 2 Y1t − 2φY3t + Y4t

(67)

Let us study the truncation to 2 terms. We replace Y3 by the value that ensures the terms
in (67) are equal to 0 (that’s the “slaving principle”), so Y3 ' σ 2 Y1t / (2φ), and injecting this
in (66), we get: Et [dY2,t ] /dt '

and the corresponding approximation is exactly the one we’ve previously derived, Eq. 64.
We can do the same for higher K’s.For instance, with r = 0, Et [dY4t ] /dt = 3σ 2 Y2t −

3φY4t − Y5t , so we replace Y4t ' Y2t σ 2 /φ. Injecting this in (67) we get:

The approximation is very good. For instance, Figure 1 plots the LG approximation Vt ,
and it is extremely close, and very hard to distinguish visually from the true value.

Conclusion

It would be good to generalize the above procedure, probably in a future paper. It suggests
that LG processes allow the evaluation of the price of many non-LG processes (e.g., those
with analytic expansions), to an arbitrary degree of precision.

Twisted vs Non-twisted process

The “twist” term in LG processes may at first glance be strange. On the other hand,
mathematically it is close to a simple AR(1). It may be useful to illustrate, in the same
simulations, how an AR(1) and a LG process behave.
Consider the processes
x∗t+∆t =

(1 − φ∆t) x∗t + vx ∆t
+ σ (x∗t ) (∆t)1/2 εt+∆t with
1 + x∗t ∆t

(72)

xt+∆t = (1 − φ∆t) xt + σ (xt ) (∆t)1/2 εt+∆t

(73)

where εt+∆t is a uniformly distributed, with mean 0 distribution with variance 1. The ν x
term is an adjustment convexity, that will be determined very soon, and is analogous to the
“σ 2 / (2φ)” in section 8. The processes mean-revert with a speed φ. The starred variables
relate to the LG process, while the non-starred variables relate to the AR(1). The dividends

¡
¢ ∗
∗
Dt+∆t
= Dt∗ 1 + η t+∆t ext ∆t+gD ∆t
where η has mean 0 and standard deviation σ η . In the above expressions, xt is a growth rate.
In another interpretation, useful when purely dealing with a price-dividend ratio, is that xt
is minus a risk premium. Stock prices are the net present value of dividend, discounted with
a risk-neutral rate r.
The variance process is:
σ 2 (X) = 2K (1 − X/Xmin )2 (1 − X/Xmax )2
with K > 0. It goes to 0 fast enough at Xmin and Xmax , ensuring that xt is within [Xmin , Xmax ].
The average volatility of X is fairly well approximated by: vx = K 1/2 ξ, with ξ = 1.35, as
proposed in the Appendix to Gabaix (2007), “A Simple, Unified, Exactly Solved Framework
for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance”.
For the simulations, each period lasts a month, ∆t = 1/12. I use annual units, and I
take R = r − gD = 0.05, for a central P/D ratio of 20. Also, (Xmin , Xmax ) = (−8%, 8%), and
φ = 0.15 (which means that xt mean-reverts with a half-life of mean-reversion of 5 years).
Finally, K = 0.1φ |Xmin | Xmax , which corresponds to a annual volatility of the log P/D
ratio of 7% (vx / (R + φ)), based solely on the eﬀect mentioned here. It is easy to increase
this volatility, for instance by introducing a positive correlation between innovations to
dividends, and innovations to dividend growth.
I simulate 100 years of data. Figures 2-4 illustrate a typical run. They show xt and x∗t ,
the corresponding price/dividend ratio Pt /Dt and Pt∗ /Dt∗ , and the (log) dividends Dt and
Dt∗ . (For the LG process, the PD ratio is in closed form; for the AR(1) process, I solve for
it numerically). Given that the processes for xt and x∗t are similar up to second order terms,
they are close, an expectation confirmed by Figure 2. The standard deviation of xt − xt∗ is
about 0.1 standard deviation of xt .
Figure 3 shows the price-dividend ratio of the two processes. They are also reasonably

close. Finally, Figure 4 shows the dividend. Despite the compounding, the dividends are
reasonably close.
The conclusion is that the processes are indeed quite close.
Of course, even if they had been quite diﬀerent, this would not have been a problem for
LG processes. We do not want to say that the true model is an AR(1), that a LG process
approximates. It could as well be that the true model is a LG process, than an AR(1) model
approximates. Or rather, as models are just approximation of a complex economic reality,
the respective advantage of LG vs aﬃne models depends on the specific task at hand. The
modeler should be able to pick whichever approximation is most convenient. It is simply
reassuring that the modelling choice does not make a large diﬀerence in terms of the economic
processes.
