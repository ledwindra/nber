    "abstract": "\n\nEntrepreneurs who start new firms may choose not-for-profit status as a means of committing to soft incentives.  Such incentives protect donors, volunteers, consumers and employees from ex post expropriation of profits by the entrepreneur.  We derive conditions under which completely self-interested entrepreneurs opt for not-for-profit status, despite the fact that this status limits their ability to enjoy the profits of their enterprises.  When entrepreneurs have a taste for producing high quality products, the incentives are even softer, and, moreover, non-profit status can serve as a signal of that taste. We also show that even in the absence of tax advantages, unrestricted donations would flow to non-profits rather than for-profit firms because donations have more significant influence on the decisions of the non-profits.\n\n",
