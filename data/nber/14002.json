    "abstract": "\n\nWe use the control function approach to identify the average treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the treated in models with a continuous endogenous regressor whose impact is heterogeneous. We assume a stochastic polynomial restriction on the form of the heterogeneity but, unlike alternative nonparametric control function approaches, our approach does not require large support assumptions.\n\n",
