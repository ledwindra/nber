    "abstract": "\n\nWe develop a continuous-time model of liquidity provision, in which hedgers can trade multiple risky assets with arbitrageurs. Arbitrageurs have CRRA utility, while hedgers\u2019 asset demand is independent of wealth. An increase in hedgers\u2019 risk aversion can make arbitrageurs endogenously more risk-averse. Because arbitrageurs generate endogenous risk, an increase in their wealth or a reduction in their CRRA coefficient can raise risk premia despite Sharpe ratios declining. Arbitrageur wealth is a priced risk factor because assets held by arbitrageurs offer high expected returns but suffer the most when wealth drops. Aggregate illiquidity, which declines in wealth, captures that factor.\n\n",
