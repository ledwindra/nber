    "abstract": "\n\nMachines are more expensive in poor countries, and the relation is pronounced.  It is hard for a Solow (1956) type of model to explain the relation between machine prices and GDP given that in most countries equipment investment is under 10% of GDP.  A stronger relation emerges in a Solow (1959) type of vintage model in which technology is embodied in machines.\n\n",
