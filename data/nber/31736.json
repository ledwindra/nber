    "abstract": "\n\nWe discuss recent work evaluating the role of the government in shaping the economy during the long 19th century, a practice we refer to as industrial policy. States deployed a vast variety of different policies aimed at, primarily, but not exclusively, fostering industrialization. A thin, but growing literature has started to evaluate the economic effects of these policies, but many questions remain open for study.\n\n",
