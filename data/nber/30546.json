    "abstract": "\n\nMany transportation policies indirectly affect vehicle travel and resulting externalities by inducing changes in vehicle scrappage rates.  We leverage the staggered removal of state-level safety inspection programs across the United States within an instrumental variables (IV) framework to produce the first estimates of the fleet-size elasticities of fleet travel distance and gasoline consumption.  Our first-stage estimates indicate that the removal of safety inspections caused a 3-4% increase in fleet size on average.  Our IV estimates of the fleet-size elasticities of fleet travel distance and gasoline consumption have 95% confidence sets that imply rejection of an assumption commonly used in prior analyses that these elasticities are equal to one.  Calculations based on fleet-size elasticities of one result in substantial overestimates of the externality costs from increases in travel and fuel use from delays in scrappage due to the removal of safety inspections.\n\n",
