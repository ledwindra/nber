    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper I analyze, within the context of the new 'financial architecture,' the relationship between exchange rate regimes, capital flows and currency crises in emerging economies. The paper draws on lessons learned during the 1990s, and deals with some of the most important policy controversies that emerged after the Mexican, East Asian, Russian and Brazilian crises. I evaluate some recent proposals for reforming the international financial architecture that have emphasized exchange rate regimes and capital mobility. I discuss emerging markets' ability to have floating exchange rate regime, and I analyze issues related to 'dollarization.'\n\n",
