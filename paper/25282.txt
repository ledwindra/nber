Introduction

Over the past thirty years, most developed economies have experienced large declines in risk-free interest
rates and increases in asset prices such as housing or stock prices, with occasional sudden crashes. At
the same time, and apart from a short period in the 1990s, economic growth, in particular productivity
growth, has been rather disappointing, and investment has been lackluster. Earnings growth of corporations has been strong however, leading in most countries to an increase in the capital share and
to stable or slightly rising pro…tability ratios. Making sense of these trends is a major endeavor for
macroeconomists and for …nancial economists.
The views expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System. We thank participants in presentations at the Brookings conference,

Given the complexity of these phenomena, it is tempting to study them in isolation. For instance, a
large literature has developed that tries to understand the decline in risk-free interest rates. But studying
these trends independently may miss confounding factors or implausible implications. For instance, an
aging population leads to higher savings supply which might well explain the decline in interest rates.
However, higher savings supply should also increase capital accumulation, i.e. investment, and hence
reduce pro…tability; it should also increases stock prices as the discount rate falls. Hence, a potential
driver that is compelling judged on its ability to explain a single trend, may be implausible overall,
because it makes it harder to account for the other trends.
Another way to highlight these tensions is to note that the stable pro…tability of private capital and
declining risk-free rate lead to a rising spread, or wedge, between these two rates of return. What gives
rise to this spread? A narrative that has recently attracted signi…cant interest is the possibility of rising
market power. On the other hand, rising risk premia could also account for the wedge. The only way
to disentangle these potential causes is to consider additional implications - for instance, everything else
equal, rising market power should imply a lower labor share, and rising risk premia should be re‡ected
in lower prices of risky assets such as stocks.
These simple observations motivate our approach. We believe that a successful structural analysis of
the past thirty years should account for these trends jointly. A novel feature of our analysis is that we
aim to account both for macro trends and …nance trends. The …rst step of our paper is to document a
set of broad macro-…nance trends which we believe are of particular interest. We focus on six indicators:
economic growth, risk-free interest rates, pro…tability, the capital share, investment, and valuation ratios
(such as the price-dividend or price-earnings ratio).
The second step in our paper is to develop an accounting framework to disentangle several potential
drivers of these trends. We focus on …ve narratives that have been put forward to explain some or
all of these trends. The …rst narrative is that the economy experienced a sustained growth decline,
owing to lower population growth, investment-speci…c technical progress, or productivity growth. The
second narrative is that savings supply has increased, perhaps owing to population aging (or to the
demand of emerging markets for store of values). A third narrative involves rising market power of
corporations. A fourth narrative focuses on technological change, coming from the introduction of
information technology, which may have favored capital or skilled labor over unskilled labor, or the
rise of hard-to-measure intangible forms of capital. A …fth narrative, which we will emphasize, involves
changes in perceived macroeconomic risk, or of tolerance towards it.
Our approach is simple enough to allow for a relatively clear identi…cation of the impact of these
drivers on the facts that we target. Here our contribution is to propose a simple macroeconomic framework - a modest extension of the neoclassical growth model - that accounts for the “big ratios”familiar
to macroeconomists as well as for the “…nancial ratios” of …nancial economists. Our model does this in
a way that allows for interesting feedbacks between macroeconomic and …nancial variables. For example, the investment-output ratio is a¤ected by market power and macroeconomic risk as well as savings
supply and technological parameters. At the same time, our framework preserves the standard intuition
and results of macroeconomists and …nancial economists, and hence is a useful pedagogical device.1
1 Our

model, of course, has to contend with the usual disconnect between macro and …nance, i.e. the equity premium

2

In our baseline estimation, we abstract from intangibles. Our main empirical result here is that the
rising spread between the return on capital is the risk-free rate is driven mostly by a con‡uence of two
factors: rising market power and rising macroeconomic risk. This rising macroeconomic risk in turns
implies that the equity premium, which previous researchers have argued fell in the 1980s and 1990s, may
have risen since around 2000. This higher risk is also an important driver of the decline of risk-free rates.
We also …nd little role for technical change. Moreover, we show how previous researchers, who have
used models without risk, have attributed too big a role to rising market power. When we incorporate
intangibles, we see that a signi…cant increase in their unmeasured component can help explain the rising
wedge between the measured marginal product of capital and the risk-free rate. Interestingly, we …nd
that intangible capital reduces the estimated role of market power in our accounting framework, while
preserving the role of risk. Overall, our estimates o¤er a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of
investment, pro…tability, and valuation ratios.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The remainder of the introduction discusses the related
literature. Section 2 documents the main trends of interest. Section 3 presents our model. Section 4
explains our empirical methodology and identi…cation. Section 5 presents the main empirical results.
Section 6 discusses some extensions and robustness. Finally, section 7 reviews some outside evidence on
the rise in the equity premium, markups, and intangibles. Section 8 concludes.

1.1

Literature review

Our paper, given its broad scope, makes contact with many other studies that have separately tried to
understand one of the key trends we document. We discuss in more detail the relation of our results to
the recent literature on market power, intangibles and risk premia in section 7.
First, there is a large literature that studies the decline of interest rates on government bonds.
Hamilton et al. (2015) provide a long-run perspective, and discuss the connection between growth and
interest rates. Rachel and Smith (2017) is an exhaustive analysis of the role of many factors that a¤ect
interest rates. Carvalho et al. (2016) and Gagnon et al. (2016) study the role of demographics in detail.
Del Negro et al. (2017) emphasize, like us, the role of the safety and liquidity premia. Bernanke (2005)
and Caballero et al. (2005) emphasize the role of safe asset supply and demand. Our analysis will
incorporate all these factors, though in a simple way.
Second, a large literature documents and tries to understand the decline of the labor share in developed economies. Elsby et al. (2013) document the facts and discuss various explanations using US
data, while Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013) study international data and argue that the decline is
driven by investment-biased technical change. Rognlie (2015) studies the role of housing. A number of
other papers discuss the impact of technical change for a broader set of facts; see for instance Acemoglu
and Restreppo (2017), Autor et al. (2017), Kehrig and Vincent (2018).
The most closely related papers are Caballero et al. (2017), Marx, Mojon and Velde (2017) and
the contemporaneous work by Eggertsson, Robins and Wold (2018). Marx, Mojon and Velde (2017)
puzzle, and hence requires high risk or high risk aversion to generate plausible quantitative implications. (While we do
not address the excess volatility puzzle in this paper, the framework can be extended along the line of Gourio (2012) to
…t that as well.)

3

also …nd, using a di¤erent methodology, that an increase in risk helps explain the rising spread between
the MPK and the risk-free rate. They do not explicitly target the evolution of other variables such as
investment or the price-dividend ratio. On the other hand, Eggertsson, Robins and Wold (2018) target
some of the same big ratios that we study, but there are di¤erences in terms of methodology and in terms
of results. Methodologically, our approach uses a simple standard model, which allows a closed-form
solution and clear identi…cation. Substantively, we …nd a more important role for macroeconomic risk
whereas they contend that rising savings supply and rising market power are the main driving forces.

Some macro-…nance trends

This section presents simple evidence on the trends a¤ecting some key macro-…nance moments. We focus
on six groups of indicators: interest rates on safe and liquid assets such as government bonds, measures
of the rate of return on private capital, valuation ratios (i.e., price-dividend or price-earnings ratio for
publicly listed companies), private investment in new capital, the labor share, and growth trends. We
…rst present simple graphical depictions, then add some statistical measures.
Our focus is on the United States, but we believe that these facts hold in other developed economies
and hence likely re‡ect worldwide trends. Like many macroeconomic studies, we will mostly consider the
post-1984 period, which is associated with low and stable in‡ation together with relative macroeconomic
stability (the “Great Moderation”). We present the changes in the simplest possible way by breaking
our sample equally in the middle, i.e. at the millennium. However, we will also discuss brie‡y the longer
trends and present continuous indicators using moving averages.
One important decision is whether to study the entire private sector, or to exclude housing and focus
for instance on non…nancial corporations. On one hand, the savings of households include all assets,
in particular housing; on the other hand, the housing sector may need to be modeled di¤erently, or we
might want to explicitly recognize the heterogeneity of capital goods. We will in this section present
indicators that cover both, but our estimation targets will cover the entire private sector. For the most
part, the trends that we document are apparent both for non…nancial corporations and in the aggregate.

2.1

Graphical evidence

We summarize the evolution of the six groups of indicators as six facts.
Fact #1: Real risk-free interest rates have fallen substantially
The top panels of …gure 1 present proxies for the one-year and ten-year real interest rates by substracting in‡ation expectations from nominal Treasury yields.2 As many authors have noted before,
there has been a strong downward trend in these measures since 1984. The short-rate exhibits some
clear cyclical ‡uctuations, while the long rate has a smoother decline. Table 1 shows that the average
2 We

use median consumer price in‡ation expectations from the Philadelphia Fed survey of professional forecasters

(SPF). Very similar results for the trend are obtained if one uses the mean expectation rather than the median; or the
Michigan survey of consumers rather than the SPF. For the one-year rate, one can also replace expectations with ex-post
in‡ation or lagged in‡ation. For the ten-year rate, one can also use the TIPS yield where available (i.e. post 1997).

one-year rate falls from around 2.8% in the …rst half of our sample (1984–2000) to -0.3% in the second
half of our sample (2001-2016). The long-term rate similarly falls from 3.9% in the …rst half to 1.1% in
the second half.
Fact #2: The pro…tability of private capital has remained stable or increased slightly
In contrast, there is little evidence that the return on private capital has fallen; if anything, it
appears to have increased slightly. Gomme, Ravikumar and Rupert (2011; thereafter GRR) construct
from national income (NIPA) data a measure of aggregate net return on physical capital, roughly
pro…ts over capital. The bottom left panel of …gure 1 depicts their series. The rising spread between
their measure, which can be thought as a proxy for the marginal product of capital, and the interest
rate on US Treasuries, is an important trend to be explained for macro- and …nancial economists.
GRR construct their series using detailed data from NIPA and other sources, but one can construct
a simple approximation using the ratio of operating surplus to capital for the non…nancial corporate
sector; Table 1 show that this ratio is also fairly constant. In our estimation exercise, we will focus
on gross pro…tability, and, to ensure consistency between our measures, will construct it simply as the
ratio of the pro…t-output ratio that we will use (i.e., one minus the labor share) to the capital-output
ratio. This measure is depicted in the bottom right panel of …gure 1; the overall level is higher, in part
because it is gross rather than net, but the trend is similar to the GRR measure.
Fact #3: Valuation ratios are stable or have increased moderately
The top two panels of …gure 2 present measures of valuation ratios for the US stock market. The top
left panel shows the ratio of price to dividends from CRSP, while the top right panel shows the priceoperating earnings ratio for the SP500.3 The later is essentially trendless, while the former exhibits a
large boom and bust in 2000 before settling down to a higher value. Another commonly used valuation
ratio is the price-smoothed earnings ratio of Shiller (CAPE), which divides the SP500 price by a ten-year
moving average of real earnings, and is reported in table 1. While all these ratios are quite volatile,
overall they exhibit only a moderate increase from the …rst period to the second period. Our analysis
will emphasize that this limited increase is puzzling given the large decline of the risk-free rate (Fact
#1).
Fact #4: The share of investment in output or in capital has fallen slightly
The bottom two panels of …gure 2 depict the behavior of investment. As several authors have
noted recently (e.g. Eberly and Lewis (2016), Gutierrez and Philippon (2017)), investment has been
relatively lackluster over the past decade or more; but the magnitude of this decline is quite di¤erent
depending on how exactly one measures it. Because the price of investment goods falls relative to the
price of consumption goods, it is simpler to focus on the expenditure share of GDP (left panel) or
the ratio of nominal investment to capital (evaluated at current cost; right panel). Both ratios ought
to be stationary in standard models, and they appear nearly trendless over long samples. Investment
3 We

focus on operating earnings which exclude exceptional items such as write-o¤s and hence are less volatile. In

particular, total earnings were negative in 2008Q4 because banks marked down the values of their assets substantially.

spending exhibits a strong cyclical pattern, increasing faster than GDP during expansions and falling
faster than GDP during recessions, but overall both ratios appear to exhibit small to moderate declines
across our two subsamples. Table 1 also reports the ratios for the nonresidential sector (i.e., business
…xed investment), which behaves very similarly, indicating that our results are not driven by housing.
Note that business …xed investment includes equipment, structures and intellectual property products.
The table also reports two measures of the evolution of the capital-output ratio; …rst, the ratio of capital
at current cost to GDP; and second, the ratio of a real index of capital services4 (from the BLS) to real
output.(which we normalize to one in 1984). Both ratios exhibit an increase of about 0.15.5
Fact #5: Total factor productivity and investment-speci…c growth have slowed down,
and the employment-population ratio has fallen
There has been much public discussion that overall GDP growth has declined over the past couple
of decades. This decline is in part attributable to a decline in the employment/population ratio, largely
due to demographic factors (Aaronson et al. (2015)), shown as the top right panel in Figure 3. However,
the decline between the two samples in output per worker growth is still large, from 1.8% per year to
1.2% per year according to table 1. This decline is largely driven by lower total factor productivity
(TFP) growth and lower investment-speci…c technical progress. Table 1 shows that the growth rate of
the Fernald TFP measure goes from 1.1% per year to less than 0.8% per year, while the growth rate of
the relative price of investment goods to nondurable and service consumption goes from -1.8% per year
to -1.1% per year. These series are depicted in the bottom panels of Figure 3.
Fact #6: The labor share has fallen
Finally, the top left panel of …gure 3 presents a measure of the gross labor share for the non…nancial
corporate sector; table 1 also includes a measure that covers the entire US economy. As has been noted
by many authors (e.g., Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013); Elsby et al. (2013); Rognlie (2015)), the
labor share exhibits a decline especially after 2000 in the United States.
Of course, all of these facts are somewhat di¢ cult to ascertain graphically given the short samples
and the noise in some series. This leads us to evaluate next the statistical signi…cance of these changes.

2.2

Statistical evaluation

To summarize the trends in these series in a more formal way, Table 1 reports several statistics for the
series presented in …gures 1-3 above as well as for some alternative series that capture the same concepts.
Columns 1-4 report the means in the …rst and second subsamples, which are depicted in …gures 1-3 as
horizontal lines, together with standard errors. Column 5 reports the di¤erence between the means in
the second and …rst sample, and column 6 is the associated standard error. Column 7 is the regression
4 This

index aggregates underlying capital goods using rental prices, which is the correct measure for an aggregate

production function. In contrast, the capital at current cost is a nominal value which sums purchase prices.
5 Over the long term, these ratios behave di¤erently. The BLS index exhibits an upward trend since the mid 1970s due
to the decline of the price of investment goods, but this trend has slowed down recently. In contrast, the current cost
capital/output ratio is nearly trendless.

error. (All standard errors are calculated using the Newey-West method with …ve (annual) lags.)
For some indicators, there is little evidence of a break between the samples, while for others, there is
overwhelming evidence of a break. Speci…cally, interest rates, the labor share, total factor productivity
growth, and the investment-capital ratios are markedly lower in the second sample. On the other hand,
valuation ratios and the return on capital appear fairly stable.

2.3

Longer historical trends

Figure 4 presents the evolution of nine of the moments we described above, but over a longer sample,
since 1950. (These nine moments will be our estimation target below.) For clarity, we add a 11–year
centered moving average to each series, so we depict the evolution from 1955 to 2011. One motivation
for studying a longer sample is that real interest rates were also low in the 1970s and to some extent
the 1960s, and hence one question is whether the abnormal period is the early 1980s when real interest
rates were very high. The …gure shows, however, that the similarities between the 1960s or 1970s and
the 2000s are limited to a few variables. It is true that pro…tability was high in the 1960s, but the pricedividend ratio was lower, and the labor share and the investment-capital ratio were relatively high, in
contrast to the more recent period. Overall, neither the 1960s nor the 1970s are similar in all respects
to the 2000s. Moreover, a serious consideration of the role of in‡ation is warranted to study the 1970s
and early 1980s, as in‡ation likely a¤ected many of the macroeconomic aggregates depicted here. This
is why, for now, we focus on the post 1984 sample. However we present below some results starting in
1950 to illustrate what our approach implies for these earlier periods.

Model

This section introduces a simple model to account for the macro-…nance moments. Our framework adds
macroeconomic risk and monopolistic competition to the standard neoclassical growth model. Given
our focus on medium-run issues, we abstract from nominal rigidities and adjustment costs.

3.1

Model setup

We consider a standard dynastic model with inelastic labor supply. In order to highlight the role of risk,
we use Epstein-Zin preferences:

where Vt is utility, Lt is population size (which is exogenous and deterministic), cpc;t is per-capita
consumption at time t;
and

is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of consumption,

the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion. We assume that labor supply is exogenous and equal to

Nt = N Lt ; where N is a parameter that captures the employment-population ratio.

t+1

: As is well known, such

a model admits in general no closed form solution. Many authors build their intuition by studying
either the nonstochastic steady-state or numerical approximations. This makes it somewhat di¢ cult to
understand the role that macroeconomic risk plays. We will show, in contrast, that for an interesting
special case, our model can be solved easily for a “risky balanced growth path”.

3.2

Risky balanced growth

We make two simplifying assumptions. First, to obtain a balanced growth path, we make the usual
assumption that the exogenous trends (population Lt , total factor productivity Zt , and investmentspeci…c technical progress Qt ) all grow at (possibly di¤erent) constant rates, so that Lt+1 =Lt = 1 + gL ;
Zt+1 =Zt = 1 + gZ ; Qt+1 =Qt = 1 + gQ for all t

0. Second, we assume that the productivity shock and

capital quality shock are equal:
t+1

=

t+1 :

In that case, it is straightforward to verify that the equilibrium has the following structure:
Xt

= T t St x ;

Yt

= T t St y ;

and similarly for Ct , while for capital and utility we have Kt = Tt St Qt k and Vt = Lt1

Tt St v . Here

the lower case starred values denote constants; St is the stochastic trend de…ned in equation (2) corresponding to the accumulation of past productivity/capital quality shocks

t;

and Tt is a deterministic

trend de…ned as:
1

Tt = Lt Zt1

Qt1

;

which growth rate is denoted gT and satis…es the usual condition:
1 + gT = (1 + gL )(1 + gZ ) 1
where

1

(1 + gQ ) 1

;

(11)

is the Cobb-Douglas parameter, gQ the rate of growth of investment-speci…c technical progress,

gL is population growth, and gZ is productivity growth. The trend growth rate of output per capita is:
1 + gP C =
14

1 + gT
:
1 + gL

Finally, the stochastic discount factor is
Mt+1 =
where

is risk aversion and

(1 + gP C )

e

t+1

E(e(1

)

t+1

)1

;

(12)

the inverse of the IES. We can then easily calculate all objects of interest

in the model, including x ; y ; as we show in the next section and in the appendix.
Figure 5 presents an example of the time series produced by the model. The equilibrium corresponds
to a “balanced growth path”, but one where macroeconomic risk still a¤ects decisions and realizations.
Speci…cally, the realization of the macroeconomic shock

t+1

a¤ects the stochastic trend St+1 and

hence Xt+1 ; Yt+1 ; etc., while the e¤ect of risk, on the other hand, is re‡ected in the constants x ; y :
The bottom line is that the “big ratios” such as It =Yt ;

t =Yt ;

t =(Kt =Qt );

etc. are constant, as in the

standard Kaldor calculations, but now incorporate risk; we discuss these ratios in the next section.6
This result holds regardless of the probability distribution of

t+1 :

The treatment of deterministic trends is completely standard. What is less standard is that in our
model, a common stochastic trend a¤ect all variables equally, which generates great tractability. In the
standard RBC model, there are no capital quality shocks, i.e.
shock

t+1

t+1

= 0; and a (permanent) productivity

leads to a transition as the economy adjusts its capital stock to the newly desired level, before

eventually reaching the new steady-state. By assuming

t+1

=

t+1 ;

this transition period is eliminated

because the capital stock “miraculously” adjusts by the correct amount. This simpli…es the solution of
the model because agents’expectations of future paths are now easy to calculate.7 , 8 The capital quality
shock is also important if the economy is to generate a signi…cant equity premium, for it makes the
return on capital volatile rather than bounded below by 1

3.3

Model implications

This section presents model implications for the “big ratios” and other key moments of interest along
the risky balanced growth path. We will present the Euler equation, which leads to a standard user cost
calculation, then discuss valuation ratios and rate of returns.
It is useful to de…ne the composite parameter

(14)

course, the economy can also exhibit transitional dynamics if its initial capital is too low or too high, before it

reaches the balanced growth path.
7 Since we will not study the actual responses to

t+1

shocks, there is little loss in this simpli…cation: what is key for

us is that agents regard the future as uncertain, and that bad realizations of

t+1

will have reasonable consequences (e.g.

a low return on capital), which lead agents ex-ante to adjust their choices (e.g. investment).
8 This argument (formulated in Gabaix (2011) and Gourio (2012)) can be applied to larger models; for instance see
Gourio, Kashyap and Sim (2018) or Isore and Szczerbowicz (2018) for New Keynesian models with disaster risk.

(15)
1 + gQ

where Q is the level of investment technical progress Qt , i.e. Qt = Q (1 + gQ )t ; so 1=Q a¤ects the level
of the relative price of investment and consumption. This equation pins down k and the capital-labor
ratio, and it generalizes the familiar condition of the neoclassical growth model to incorporate risk,
through

. We can rewrite this as the equality of the user cost of capital and marginal revenue:

(16)

Equation (16) directly shows how higher market power or a higher required risky return lower the desired
capital-labor ratio.
To calculate the other big ratios, …rst note that Kt =Qt is the capital stock, evaluated at current cost.
The capital-output ratio is obtained from equation (16) as:

which re‡ects the familiar balanced growth relation. Last, the investment-output ratio is obtained by

sL =

Because we do not incorporate adjustment costs, Tobin’s Q equals (approximately) one when there is

several parameters, which a¤ect (i) the size of the economy and hence the rents, (ii) the discount rate
applied to all future rents.

Q is usually de…ned as Pt =(Kt+1 =Qt+1 ), but with capital quality shocks Kt+1 is unknown at time t, leading

us to adopt this de…nition, which creates the 1 + gT wedge. One could also de…ne Tobin’s Q as Pt =(Et Kt+1 =Qt+1 ), which
eliminates the wedge provided that Et e

3.3.4

Rates of Return

We now compare three benchmark rate of returns in this economy: the risk-free rate, the return on equity,
and the pro…tability of capital, which is often used in macroeconomics as a proxy for the marginal product
of capital. The gross risk-free rate (which can be priced even though it is not traded in equilibrium) is
RF =

E e(1

=
E(Mt+1 )
E e

which we can rewrite as the net risk-free rate, i.e. rf = RF
r + log E e(1

rf

)

)

log E e

:

(25)

The average pro…tability of capital can be inferred, as in Gomme, Ravikumar and Rupert (2011) and
Mulligan (2002), as the ratio of (measured) pro…ts to the stock of capital. This can be calculated either
gross or net of depreciation. For instance, in gross terms, we have
MPK

=
=

t

;
Kt =Qt
+
1

(r + + gQ ) :

(26)

Conceptually, this M P K exceeds the risk-free rate for three reasons; …rst, it is gross of both physical
and economic depreciation; second, it incorporates pro…t rents; third, it is risky. We can decompose the
spread between the M P K and the risk-free rate to re‡ect these three components:
MPK

1

rf = + gQ +

(r + + gQ ) + r

rf :

(27)

A main goal of our empirical analysis is to evaluate the importance of these di¤erent components.
The expected equity return is de…ned as
Pt+1 + Dt+1
Pt

E (Rt+1 ) = E

;

and it is easy to show using equation (23) that
E(Rt+1 ) =

hence equal expected returns.
Finally, the equity risk premium ERP is obtained by combining equations (25) and (28):
ERP =

:

Comparative statics

We now use the expressions developed in the previous section to illustrate some key comparative statics
of the risky balanced growth path. These comparative statics are useful to understand identi…cation of
18

our model. Most of the parameters have the usual e¤ects; we will focus on parameters that are typically
absent from the neoclassical growth model, or parameters that play an important role in our empirical
results.
3.4.1

E¤ect of risk

The e¤ect of higher risk on macroeconomic variables is mediated through
experiment is to consider a shift of the distribution of the shock
dominance, so that

: The cleanest thought

in the sense of second-order stochastic

becomes more risky. Such a shift reduces E(e(1

)

)1

1

; and hence leads to a

lower

if and only if

< 1; i.e. the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is greater than unity. A

lower

in turn leads to a lower capital-output ratio, a lower investment-output ratio, and a higher

pro…t-capital ratio, according to equations (17), (19), and (26) respectively. The logic is that risk deters
investment in that case, leading to less capital accumulation. This reduction in the supply of capital
increases the marginal product of capital given a stable demand for capital. Moreover, as is well known
in the macro-…nance literature, and as shown by equation (23), higher risk decreases the P D ratio if
the IES is greater than unity. On the other hand, if the IES is low, higher risk leads to a lower expected
return, and hence higher capital accumulation, and a higher price-dividend ratio. Risk has no e¤ect
on the labor share or long-term growth (though higher risk has a level e¤ect on capital and GDP, i.e.
k and y ). The equity risk premium r

rf is increasing in risk, regardless of the IES. The spread

between the M P K and the risk-free rate is hence increasing in risk, at least if

is small enough so that

the middle term does not dominate the third term.
We have not speci…ed the distribution of the shock ; but for some particular distributions one can
obtain exact formulas. For instance, if
increase in

is a pure increase in risk, we have, denoting b =
log

and mean

(1 + gP C )

:

These formulas capture the usual e¤ect of risk aversion and the quantity of risk on the ERP and the
risk-free rate, but are now valid in a production economy, and furthermore

links macroeconomic

risk to macroeconomic variables such as the capital-output ratio as discussed above. We provide more
discussion in appendix for di¤erent assumptions about the distribution of :
3.4.2

E¤ect of savings supply

In our model, the e¤ects of a change in the discount factor

are the same as a change in risk, since both

but

or the quantity of risk : In the case where the IES

has the same implications as lower risk. Hence, higher savings supply

leads to higher capital accumulation, higher investment-output ratio and a lower marginal product of
capital, and a higher price-dividend ratio, while the risk-free rate falls. The spread between the M P K
19

and the risk-free rate, shown in equation (27) is little a¤ected by :
through r , while the equity risk premium r
3.4.3

only a¤ects the quantity of rents

rf is independent of :

E¤ect of market power

One potentially important factor that has been invoked to explain of the trends we document is market
power. In our model, an increase in

has no e¤ect on long-term growth, the risk-free rate, or the price-

dividend ratio, but it has a signi…cant e¤ect on other variables. Higher markups reduce both the labor
share and the “true capital share” sc , but increases the pure pro…t share s . According to equations
(19) and (17), higher market power also reduces investment-output and capital-output ratios, as …rms
have less incentive to build capacity. The spread between the M P K and the risk-free rate is increasing
in market power (equation (27)). Finally, higher market power reduces the level of GDP by reducing
capital accumulation.
3.4.4

E¤ect of trend growth

Trend growth gT - which can traced back to productivity growth, population growth, or investmentspeci…c technical growth –a¤ects

but also a¤ects independently the ratios of interest. Higher growth

generally increases the investment-capital and investment-output ratios and increases the risk-free rate
and valuation ratios, while the e¤ect on pro…tability ratios depends on the exact source of growth.

Accounting framework

This section describes our empirical approach and discusses identi…cation.

4.1

Methodology

We use a simple method of moment estimation. In the interest of clarity and simplicity, we perform an
exactly identi…ed estimation with 9 parameters and 9 moments. In a …rst exercise, we estimate the model
separately over our two samples: 1984-2000 and 2001-2016. We then discuss which parameters drive
variation in each moment. In a second exercise, we estimate the model over 11-year rolling windows,
starting with 1950–1961, and ending with 2006-2016. In all cases, we …t the model risky balanced growth
path to the model moments. In doing so, we abstract from business cycle shocks, in line with our focus
on longer frequencies.11
The moments we target are motivated by the observations in introduction and in the …rst section:
(M1) the measured gross pro…tability
(M2) the measured gross capital share

=K;
=Y ;

(M3) the investment-capital ratio I=K;
(M4) the risk-free rate RF ;
1 1 This

exercise involves some schizophrenia, because our model assumes that parameters are constant, even though they

are estimated to change over time; and when parameters change, the model would exhibit some transitional dynamics,
which we abstract from for now; see Section 6. Further, the agents inside our model do not understand that parameters
might change, let alone anticipate some of these changes.

(M6-M8) the growth rates of population, total factor productivity, and investment prices;
(M9) the employment-population ratio.
As we will see, these moments will lead to a clear identi…cation of our nine parameters, which are:
(P1) the discount factor ;
(P2) risk, modeled as the probability of an economic crisis or “disaster” p;
(P3) the markup ;
(P4) the depreciation rate of capital ;
(P5) the Cobb-Douglas parameter ;
(P6-P8) the growth rates of total factor productivity gZ , investment-speci…c progress gQ , and population gL ;
(P9) the labor supply parameter N :
The choice of moments is motivated, of course, by the questions of interest - explaining the joint
evolution of interest rates, pro…tability, investment, valuation, and trend growth - but also by the clarity
with which these moments map into estimated parameters. For instance, because we target

=K;

=Y

and I=K (and that we have taken care to construct these moments in a consistent manner), the model will
mechanically match the evolution of the investment-output ratio I=Y or the capital-output ratio K=Y:
Hence, we could have taken I=Y as a target moment, which would have led to the exact same estimates
and implications, but the identi…cation is clearer with I=K: Beyond this, some changes in identi…cation
strategy are possible however; for instance, one could target the price-earnings ratio instead, or GDP
growth per worker; these yield quite similar results.
We also note that the parameters can be mapped into the narratives often put forth when discussing
the trends, at least at a high level; in particular, changes in longevity map into a change in the discount
factor

; more generally, changes in savings supply can be captured as changes in

; changes in the

competitive environment are captured by a change in ; changes in technology should be re‡ected in
; ; or the growth rates of the technological factors gZ and gQ ; etc. However, it is also possible that
some economic factors a¤ect all our parameters at the same time.
There are three parameters that we do not estimate; we discuss why, and how this a¤ects our
results in the next section on identi…cation. The three parameters are the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution 1= ; the coe¢ cient of risk aversion , and the size of macroeconomic shocks b. Speci…cally,
we will assume that

Identi…cation

In this section we provide a heuristic discussion of identi…cation, and make two main points. First, the
identi…cation is nearly recursive, so that it is easy to see which moments a¤ect which parameters. Second,
and consequently, the identi…cation of some parameters does not depend on all the data moments.
The identi…cation is easily seen to be nearly recursive. First, some parameters are obtained directly
as their counterparts are assumed to be observed: population growth, investment price growth (the
opposite of gQ ), and the employment-population ratio. The growth rate gZ is next chosen to match
measured total factor productivity.12 One hence obtains gT , the trend growth rate of GDP, given by
equation (11). The depreciation rate

is then chosen to match I=K according to the familiar balanced

growth relation (equation (18)):
I
' + gQ + gT :
K
The model then uses the Gordon growth formula (23) to infer the expected return on risky assets, r
given the observed price-dividend ratio:
1 + gT
P

:
D

gT
Importantly, to infer r ; we do not need data on the risk-free rate, or assumptions about the value of

The next step is to identify the parameters

and

to match the pro…t share of output and the ratio

of pro…ts to capital using the equations (20) and (27), i.e.

and

does not require data on the

the su¢ cient statistic r which has been previously identi…ed.
Economically, our approach boils down to using the traditional Gordon growth formula - which holds
in our standard neoclassical framework - to deduce the required return on capital from the price-dividend
ratio and the growth rate, and hence to construct a user cost of capital r + + gQ that incorporates
risk.13
At this point, we can also bring in data on the risk-free rate to infer the equity premium r

rf : Here

again, note that the behavior of the equity premium is therefore inferred without making assumptions
about risk aversion

or the distribution of

, risk aversion , and the quantity of risk

assumptions about these variables and about the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (which is not

Empirical Results

We …rst compare the two subsamples, then we contrast the results with more standard macroeconomic
approaches which do not entertain a role for risk, and …nally we present results over rolling windows in
a long sample.

5.1

Comparison of two subsamples

Table 2 shows the estimated parameters for each subsample and the change of parameters between
subsamples. Overall, our results substantiate many of the narratives that have been advanced and
that we mention in the introduction. The discount factor

rises by 1.2 point, re‡ecting higher savings

supply. Market power increases signi…cantly, by 6.7 points. Technical progress slows down and labor
supply falls (relative to population). The model also estimates a signi…cant increase in macroeconomic
risk (the probability of a crisis), which goes from 3.4% per year to 6.5% per year. We will return to
1 3 Our

procedure is closely related to the approach of Barkai (2016), the main di¤erence being the way we incorporate

risk. Barkai (2016) simply uses a treasury rate or corporate bond yield to construct the user cost.

the interpretation of this result later. On the other hand, there is only moderate technological change:
depreciation increases, re‡ecting the growing importance of high-depreciation capital such as computers,
but the Cobb-Douglas parameter remains fairly stable. This stability of the production function is an
interesting result. Overall, the model gives some weight to four of the most popular explanations
( ; ; p; gs): But exactly how much does each story explain?

Table 3 provides one answer. By construction, the model …ts perfectly all nine moments in each
subsample using the nine parameters . We can decompose how much of the change in each moment
between the two subsamples is accounted for by each parameter. Because our model is nonlinear, this
is not a completely straightforward task; in particular, when changing a parameter from …rst subsample
value to second subsample value, the question is at which value to evaluate the other parameters (e.g.,
the …rst or second subsample value). If the model were linear, or the changes in parameters small, this
would not matter, but such is not the case here, in particular for the price-dividend ratio. In this table,
we simply report the average over all possible orders of changing parameters, as we move from the …rst
to the second subsample.14

Table 3: The table reports the target moments in each of the two subsamples 1984-2000 and 2001-2016,
as well as the change between samples, and the contribution of each parameter to each change in moment
(so that column 3 equals the sum of columns 4 to 12). See text for details.
Overall, we see that the decline in the risk-free rate of 3.1% (314bps) is explained mostly by two
factors, higher perceived risk p, and higher savings supply ; with lower growth playing only a moderate
role.15 Why does the model not attribute all the change in the risk-free rate to savings supply? Simply
because it would make it impossible to match other moments, in particular the P D ratio. Even as it
is, if only the change in savings supply

were at work, the P D ratio would increase by over 30 points.

The model attributes o¤setting changes to risk and growth, explaining in this way that the P D ratio
increased only moderately over this period despite the lower interest rates.
Similarly, pro…tability would decrease by almost 2 points if the change in

was the only one at work

- all rate of returns ought to fall if the supply of savings increases. The model reconciles the stable
pro…tability with the data by inferring higher markups and higher risk. Overall, we see how the model
needs multiple forces to account for the lack of changes observed in some ratios. The higher capital
share is attributed entirely to higher markups, as capital-biased technical change appears to play little
role.

We can now use these model estimates to understand the evolution of some other moments; these are
reported in table 4. First, as we discussed in Section 3 (equation 27), the spread between the measured
marginal product of capital and the risk-free rate can be decomposed in three components:
MPK
for the change in the data: f (

rf ;

ma : In appendix, we also report the upper and lower bounds when

consider all possible combinations of other parameters. This provides a way to bound the importance of each factor. See
Gourio and Schulhofer-Wohl (2018) for more details.
1 5 This conclusion does depend somewhat on our assumed intertemporal elasticity of substitution, as we discuss in detail
below.

25

where the three components are depreciation ( + gQ ), rents, and risk (r

rf ). We can calculate

this decomposition in the model using the estimated parameters. The table reveals that depreciation
changed little overall - faster physical depreciation is o¤set by slower economic depreciation - but the
rents and risk components both rise by about two percentage points. (An alternative way to decompose
the change in spread is to read, in the …rst row, the decomposition of the change in spread due to each
parameter change; this yields a similar answer, as the increases in

and in p account for the bulk of

the increase in the spread.)
We also report the model implied equity return and equity premium. While not a direct target, we
estimate a sizeable equity premium, of nearly 5 percent per year in the recent sample. (This premium
assumes no leverage; see section 6 for a discussion of leverage.) More interestingly, the premium increased
by around 2 percentage points since 2000. In total,expected equity returns have fallen by about one
percentage point because the decline in the risk-free rate is larger than this increase in the equity
premium.
Regarding valuation ratios, we have already emphasized the moderate increase of the price-dividend
ratio due to o¤setting factors. Table 4 also shows the analysis of the price-earnings ratio and Tobin’s Q.
The later increases signi…cantly from 2.50 to 3.84 between the two samples, re‡ecting both the increase
in market power and the e¤ect of the change in discount rates at which these rents are discounted.
The model also speaks to the income distribution between labor, capital, and rents. The approach
taken here is that we observe accurately the payments to labor in the data, and cannot easily split
the remainder between capital and pro…ts. In the model, we can study the decomposition and how it
changes between the two subsamples. The nearly 4 point decline in the labor share is accompanied by
an even larger increase in the pro…t share, by nearly 5 points, so that the capital share actually declines
slightly.
Finally, we can use the model to see the e¤ect of these changes on macroeconomic variables - for
instance the capital-output or investment-output ratios. On one hand, higher savings supply pushes
investment up leading to more capital accumulation. For instance, the change in

would push the

investment-output ratio up by over 2 percentage points, while in the data it fell. On the other hand,
rising market power and rising risk push investment down. Our model hence accounts for the coexistence
of low investment and low interest rates. Note also that higher depreciation also requires more investment
along the balanced growth path, while lower growth implies less investment. The model hence produces
a fairly nuanced decomposition for the evolution of this ratio.
We can also ask what is the e¤ect of each parameter on the level of GDP or investment.16 For
instance, higher market power discourages capital accumulation and reduces output. It is easy to show
that the elasticity of GDP to markups in this model is

=(1

); or

0:32 for our estimate. Given

estimated markups rise by 6.2 percent (=6.7/1.079), the e¤ect on GDP is about

0:32

6:2; or about

minus two percentage points (-1.95% in our table). Here too, there are several counteracting factors,
however, which imply that the overall level e¤ect on GDP is small (-0.30%). In particular, higher savings
1 6 By

level of GDP we mean y ; i.e. the level of GDP once the proper deterministic and stochastic trends have been

removed. We abstract from the growth e¤ects - e.g., a higher gZ or gQ has the mechanical e¤ect of steepening the overall
path of GDP.

26

supply and lower economic depreciation lead to higher capital accumulation, while higher risk leads to
lower capital accumulation. Investment is more negatively a¤ected by the changes, with a level e¤ect
of about minus 5 percentage points, owing largely to markups and risk, but also to lower growth and a
lower employment-population ratio.

5.2

Comparison with macroeconomic approaches

It is interesting to compare our results with alternative procedures followed by macroeconomists. Indeed,
our empirical exercise is essentially the calibration of the “steady-state”of a very bare-bone DSGE model.
Any DSGE model writer faces the same issues we do to …t these key moments.
Indeed, real business cycle modelers are aware of a trade-o¤ between …tting the capital-output ratio
and the risk-free interest rate. Since these models also target the labor share, the discrepancy precisely
re‡ects the gap between the M P K (the pro…t-capital ratio) and the risk-free interest rate. Often,
modelers reject short-term Treasury interest rates as measures of the rate of return on capital, noting
that these securities have special safety and liquidity attributes, which are not explicitly modeled.17
Mechanically, these models consider that the observed risk-free rate equals the model risk-free rate
times an unobserved convenience yield e . This yields an additional parameter

to estimate. At the

same time, these models have traditionally abstracted from aggregate market power, setting

= 1;18

and from risk, so that p = 0, and have not explicitly targeted the price-dividend ratio. The assumptions
lead to a well-de…ned exactly identi…ed exercise with eight moments (our baseline, minus the pricedividend ratio) and eight parameters (our baseline plus the liquidity wedge , less market power

and

risk p), which is an alternative to our approach. The last two columns of Table 5 present the results
from this exercise, which we call the “macro-without-markups” approach.
This approach leads to a much higher value of

and “explains”the decline of the labor share by an

increase of : The decline of the Treasury rate, and the growing gap between the M P K and this rate,
are fully accounted for by a very large, and growing, liquidity premium, which equals

= 6:1 percent

in the …rst sample and 10:2 percent in the second sample. We …nd both the level and change in this
wedge implausible.
An alternative approach is to abstract from this liquidity but to allow for markup, while still omitting
the P D ratio from the list of targets and risk from the potential parameters. This is also a well-posed
exercise with 8 moments and 8 parameters which we call the “macro-with-markups” approach. In this
case, the spread between the M P K and the risk-free rate must re‡ect depreciation or rents. Intuitively,
this approach assumes that the risk-free rate can be used to infer the cost of capital, and hence rents
are deduced as a residual. The approach is conceptually quite similar to Barkai (2016), though we
present it in a slightly more structural framework. The results are shown in the middle two columns
1 7 See

for instance Campbell et al. (2017) for a presentation of the Chicago Fed DSGE model, which, based on Fisher

(2015), introduces a liquidity wedge that accounts for the discrepancy between the rate of return of capital and the risk-free
rate.
1 8 New Keynesian models are an important exception, but market power is often set on a priori basis in these studies
(e.g., a markup of 15%), and pro…ts are o¤set in steady-state by …xed costs.

Table 5: The table reports the estimated parameters in each of the two subsamples 1984-2000 and
2001-2016 in our baseline model, in the macro model with markups, and in the macro model without
markups.
of table 5. There are a number of di¤erences between these results and our baseline results. First, the
level of markups is much higher, and the increase in markups is much stronger (16.6 points instead of
6.7 points). Second, the increase in markups is so large that the model requires a sharp decline in
(from 0.18 to 0.12) to keep the labor share from falling too much. This estimate suggests that technical
progress has been biased towards labor over the past thirty years - a somewhat implausible conclusion.
On the other hand, this model also implies that

rose signi…cantly. We discuss below some further

di¤erences for a longer sample.

Table 6 presents the implications of these di¤erent “calibrations”. Notably, our approach o¤ers a
balanced view where markups and risk premia increases jontly explain the rising spread, while the
macro model without markups accounts all of it with an unmodeled liquidity premium and the macro
model with markups accounts for all of it with rising market power. As a result, that the macro model
with markups implies a sharp decline of the level of GDP, by about 8 percentage points. Moreover, the
share of income going to capital falls sharply, in opposite to the share of pro…ts which surges. On the
other hand, the macro model without markups predict an increase in the level of GDP relative to trend
- the liquidity premium does not discourage capital accumulation in that model as much as markups or
risk premia do in the other versions of the model.
Another interesting implication is that Tobin’s Q, which increase signi…cantly in our baseline, in
a way broadly consistent with the data, is actually unde…ned in the macro-with-markups approach,
because the low discount rates make the …rm value in…nite. In this sense, that model cannot match the
evolution of valuation ratios, given its target of interest rates. Furthermore, the macro-without-markups
approach implies decreasing valuation ratios, at odds with the data, owing to the very large, and rising,

29

liquidity premium. These results provide indirect support for our baseline model.

5.3

Rolling estimation

An alternative approach to …tting the model is to estimate it using rolling windows rather than two
subsamples. In this spirit, …gure 6 presents the estimated parameters when we estimate the model each
year using a 11–year centered moving average to calculate the target moments. (That is, we target the
smooth lines shown in Section 2 in …gure 4.) We start our analysis in 1950 to avoid World War II.19 As
noted above, this calculation assumes that agents are myopic, in the sense that they believe that the
currently observed target moments will be constant forever, and it abstracts from transitional dynamics.
We …nd a U shape in the parameter

(savings supply) and in macroeconomic risk p: Hence, our

results suggest that risk premia declined in the 1970s and early to mid 1980s before rising. Markups
also have a U shape but also an initial increase in the 1950s and 1960s. The capital parameter

has

an increase in the late 1970s which is later reversed. Figure 7 compares the evolution of our parameters
;

to the parameters estimated using the “macro with markups”approach. Our estimated parameters

are signi…cantly more stable over time - the U shape is much weaker. We …nd this interesting because
accounting for stock market valuation ratios might be expected to lead to more unstable parameters but we …nd the opposite.
We can then use these rolling estimates to study the income distribution, the return spread M P K
RF; and their drivers. Figure 8 presents the share of pure pro…ts, the true capital share, and the sum
of the two for each year. By construction, the total equals one minus the labor share, and matches the
data exactly.
The …gure shows that the share of pure pro…ts is estimated to have risen in the 1960s, then falling in
the 1970s and rising since 1980. Inversely, the capital share fell, then rose and fell. This picture re‡ects
the puzzling pattern of U shape in pro…ts and inverse U shape in

emphasized by Karabarbounis and

Neiman (2018). However, we …nd it interesting that the U shape is signi…cantly less strong with our
estimation strategy than if one follows the macro with markups strategy. Karabarbounis and Neiman
(2018) note that the strong negative correlation between the interest rate and the capital share, and the
strong positive correlation between the interest rate and the pro…t share, are suggestive of measurement
problems in the cost of capital. Figure 9 shows the capital share and the pure pro…t share implied by
the two estimations. There is clearly less volatility of the macro-…nance estimates.
Figure 10 presents the M P K

RF spread and its three subcomponents: economic and physical

depreciation, rents, and risk. The spread falls in the 1970s before rising in the 1980s. The depreciation
component moves, if anything, in opposite direction to the spread, and hence does not help explain its
movements. Rents are estimated to fall then rise, and so does risk. The empirical success here is that
the risk premium - which is estimated without looking at the M P K, but rather by single-mindedly
observing the P D ratio and growth rates - helps explain some of this variation.

Figure 10: This …gure presents the model-implied spread between the average product of capital and

using the estimated parameters for each year.

Figure 11 again compares these results to those obtained with the more standard macro estimation.
Both estimation approaches infer the same depreciation component. The macro approach attributes
none of the spread to risk by construction and hence infers a large and highly volatile rent (or pro…t)
component. Finally, …gure 12 depicts the implied risk-free rate, expected equity return and equity risk
premium. The risk-free rate exactly matches our data target by construction. The equity premium
mimics the evolution of p depicted in …gure 6.

Extensions and robustness

This section presents some extensions of our baseline framework. We …rst discuss the interpretation of
rising risk premia and alternative approaches to modeling them. We next analyze how …nancial leverage,
the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, alternative interest rates that adjust for liquidity or term
premia, and capital mismeasurement a¤ect our results. Finally, we present an example to evaluate the
importance of transitional dynamics.

6.1

Interpretation of rising risk premia

Our baseline results are obtained using a parametrization of

as a rare “disaster” corresponding to

a permanent decline of 15% of the level of GDP. Our estimates suggest that the risk of such a large
shock was low in the 1990s but rose gradually in the 2000s and 2010s. Part of this increase may be
attributed to a recognition post 2008 that …nancial crises are recurrent events that a¤ect even developed

economies.20 But part of this increase occurs before the …nancial crisis. One interpretation is that this
increase corresponds to a higher perception of risk starting in the late 1990s and early 2000s owing
to the combination of the Asian …nancial crisis, LTCM crisis, and the 2001 crash in the US. We must
acknowledge however that it is not straightforward to relate our estimate of the probability of a “disaster”
to data on beliefs or other asset prices.21 This leads us to study in this section alternative risk modeling.
For instance, the ageing of developed economies, or the desire of emerging markets to accumulate safe
reserves might be interpreted in a reduced form as higher e¤ective risk aversion.
As explained in section 4.2, the precise speci…cation of the risk model is theoretically irrelevant for
some conclusions, such as the value of markups

or the Cobb-Douglas parameter , or the estimated

equity premium ERP: We now illustrate that even for the objects where this speci…cation is potentially
relevant, it may not be quantitatively …rst-order. Table 7 presents estimates of parameters in the …rst
and second samples under some di¤erent assumptions. The …rst row presents the baseline model. The
second and third row present alternative disaster models where, rather than a “bonanza”or windfall to
o¤set the disaster risk, we introduce a small positive drift (row 2) or simply do not o¤set the disaster
(row 3). The results are nearly identical. Row 4 considers a log-normal process for
rare disaster. That model requires a large, and rising, standard deviation

rather than a

of the lognormal shock

to account for the data, but as we will see, it behaves quite similarly overall. Rows 5 and 6 display
estimates when the disaster size b (resp. risk aversion ), rather than the disaster probability, is allowed
to vary. Unsurprisingly, these models require rising disaster size or risk aversion to account for the data.
But all of these models generate the same perfect …t of the data moments. Finally, rows 7 and 8 present
estimates of the baseline model when the IES is set to unity or half rather than two; we discuss these
below.

Table 8 present the “causal” decomposition along the lines of Tables 3 and 4, i.e. they show the
e¤ect of the changes in , the risk parameter used in the variant (p; , b or

), or the other parameters

(all grouped together for simplicity) on some model moments. We know already that the implications
for

; , etc. are unchanged; so we focus here on three key …nancial variables: the risk-free rate, the

price-dividend ratio, and Tobin’s Q: The table shows that across a range of speci…cations, the decline
of the risk-free rate is driven in signi…cant parts by

and by the risk parameter - the probability of

disaster, or the risk aversion or disaster size, regardless of the exact speci…cation. Similarly, the increase
in the price-dividend ratio and in Tobin’s Q is the result of o¤setting e¤ects of the decline of

and the

increase of the risk factor. Hence, our results are insensitive to the exact way risk is modeled.

2 0 Kozlowski,
2 1 The

Veldkamp and Venkateswaran (2017) o¤er a quantitative theory along these lines.
issues also arise when studying the 1960s and 1970s, where our model says the risk of disaster was larger. The

1970s were a volatile decade, so it is perhaps not surprising that perceived tail risk was high.

Leverage

Our model calculations assume an all-equity …nanced …rm. In reality corporations are leveraged, which
may a¤ect in particular the price-dividend ratio, which we use as an input in our estimation strategy.
In this section, we propose a simple approach to bound the e¤ect of leverage. To take this into account,
we assume a Modigliani-Miller world where corporate leverage has no e¤ect on real quantities, and
only a¤ects prices and dividends. We assume corporate debt is fully risk-free. We then adjust the
price-dividend ratio of the model given an exogenous leverage decision which we take directly from the
data.22 We then re-estimate the model and obtain the results shown in the third set of columns in tables
9 and 10.23
Qualitatively, the …ndings are quite similar to those of the model without leverage:

go up, and are important contributors to the observed changes in the risk-free rate, pro…tability, and
the price-dividend ratio. However, the role of risk is somewhat smaller than in our baseline version.
The logic is clear from the Gordon formula: with leverage, the change in r required to account for the
change in valuation ratio is smaller. (Going in the other direction, however, is that in our data, aggregate
leverage declines from the …rst sample to the second one.) In particular for the spread decomposition
MPK

RF in table 10, the share of the spread due to risk is smaller (2.08 and 3.81 percentage points

in the …rst and second sample respectively). However, the share of the increase in the spread due to
risk remains substantial. Moreover, in terms of the implied equity premium, the increase is actually
similar, because leverage now ampli…es the variation in r : These results are conservative, because we
have assumed that corporate debt pays the same return as the risk-free asset; in reality, corporate debt
yields are higher than Treasuries yields, which would reduce the adjustment to the P D ratio.

6.3

Intertemporal elasticity of substitution

We have assumed an elasticity of substitution equal to 2 in our baseline estimation. The IES also cannot
be identi…ed given that the model generates iid growth rates for all macroeconomic variables. As noted
above, the assumed value for the IES does not a¤ect estimates of

,

, r ; or the equity premium.

This can be veri…ed in tables 9 and 10 where we present parameter estimates for an elasticity equal
to 0.5. Our conclusions that risk and market power increased are hence completely una¤ected by this
assumption. However, changing the IES does a¤ect the counterfactual decompositions studied above;
for instance the e¤ect of an increase in risk on capital accumulation depends on the assumed IES.
Table 8 presents decompositions for three …nancial variables, and the online appendix provides the
decompositions of all variables. With a low IES, the e¤ect of the decline of growth in accounting for
the decline of the risk-free rate is larger. The model hence does not require an increase in
2 2 Speci…cally,

we use S&P data and de…ne leverage as short-term debt plus long-term debt less cash, divided by market

value of equity; see data appendix.
2 3 As an alternative approach, one can adjust the r from the model directly to account for leverage, noting that the
r identi…ed by the model from the PD ratio is actually (1 + !)r

!r f where ! is the observed debt-equity ratio. This

approach yields nearly identical results to the one where we adjust the P D ratio directly.

falls. The change of the risk-free rate due to uncertainty is now larger. In this sense, a lower IES gives
a larger role for risk. As emphasized by Bansal and Yaron (2004), higher risk and lower growth both
raise the P D ratio because of their strong e¤ect on the risk-free rate.

6.4

Liquidity and term premia

As a risk-free rate proxy in the data, we use the one year Treasury rate (minus lagged core in‡ation).
One concern is that our model abstracts from the term and liquidity premia which makes this rate
especially low. To gauge the role of the liquidity premium, we instead use as a risk-free rate proxy the
rate on AAA/AA corporate bonds, minus the SPF median CPI in‡ation over the next 10 years. This
is rate for securities which do not possess the same unique liquidity attributes as a US Treasury. We
then repeat our estimation. The rightmost columns of tables 9 and 10 show the results. Given the
identi…cation provided by the model, changing the risk-free rate does not a¤ect ; ; or r : However, the
di¤erent risk-free rate target will a¤ect the value of

and the amount of risk identi…ed by the model,

and their respective changes. Indeed, we see that the estimated

does not increase across samples. The

level of risk estimated is smaller, but crucially, our model still estimates that risk increased signi…cantly
between the two samples. Our conclusion about the relative importance of risk and markups is not
a¤ected by this change in target, suggesting that liquidity considerations do not play a very large role
in these trends.
A related concern is that long-term rates re‡ect term premia which may be driven by an in‡ation
premium, which is not present in the model. We hence consider as target for the risk-free rate the 10 year
Treasury constant maturity rate, less SPF expected in‡ation, less the term premium estimate of Adrian,
Crump and Moench, which is obtained from a statistical term structure model. Because the term premia
estimate decline strongly during this period, the decline in this measure of risk-free rate is only 1.5 point
rather than over 3 points. The resulting estimates imply a smaller increase in macroeconomic risk.

Moreover, the spread M P K

RF is also increasing by a smaller amount, and the contribution of risk

premia is smaller there as well. We view these results as somewhat less plausible because the decline of
term premium implied by this model is very large - we are unaware of macroeconomic models that can
rationalize this. Also, to the extent that the decline of term premium is related to macroeconomic risk,
it may not be sound to adjust for it.

6.5

Capital mismeasurement

One natural explanation for the rising spread M P K

RF is that K is mismeasured, and in particular is

underestimated by the BEA analysts, who traditionally focus on tangible assets. To get a sense of how
much mismeasurement of capital matters, we present a simple approach in this section. In the online
appendix, we then estimate a more detailed model of intangible accumulation. We are interested in two
questions: …rst, can a plausible amount of mismeasurement explain the rising spread? Second, is this
mismeasurement also consistent with the other observed features of the data?
In this section, we simply assume that the BEA measures only a fraction

of total investment. When

= 1; there is no mismeasurement, corresponding to our baseline model. When

< 1 however, this

mismeasurement of investment a¤ects our target moments, and hence possibly our parameter estimates.
Denote with a superscript m the measured values of the model variables.24 Measured investment is
xm = x; and hence along the balanced growth path k m = k: Moreover, GDP and the pro…t share are
now under-estimated since the unmeasured investment (1

However, dividends are correctly measured since the unmeasured investment reduces both pro…ts and
investment: d =

investors do not observe intangible investment).
It is easy to extend our formula (27) for the spread:
MPK

rf = + gQ +

(r + + gQ ) + r

k

(29)

and we see that mismeasurement ( < 1) now adds an additional component to the measured spread,
consistent with basic intuition.
How important is this mismeasurement wedge? First, note that the measured ratio d=( k) = d=k m
is fairly small, around 7.5% in the second sample (and 6% in the …rst sample), according to our data
moments. Hence, with

= 0:8, or a 20 percent under-measurement, the wedge is 1.2-1.5 point, which

is signi…cant. Our focus, however, is on the increase in the spread. To explain this increase requires a
rising mismeasurement. While there is wide agreement that intangibles play a critical role in modern
economies, it is not as clear if mismeasurement has increased over the past few decades. Suppose
however, that one wanted to generate an increase the spread by 2 percentage points (or about half of
2 4 We

do the algebra for detrended variables, but one can obviously also apply the same adjustments to the level variables.

41

the increase in the spread observed during our sample, and about the same as what is explained by risk
premia or markups according to our baseline results), the model requires
(perfect measurement) to

to go for instance from 1

= 0:73, a 27% underestimation of investment. This rising mismeasurement

would reduce measured GDP by 4.4% and the pro…t share by 4 percentage points. One tension, hence,
is that rising intangibles lead to a measured labor share going up rather than down, as in the data.
To evaluate more precisely how this mismeasurement a¤ects our results, we estimate three versions of
our baseline model corresponding to di¤erent assumptions about mismeasurement. In the …rst version,
mismeasurement is constant at 10% in both samples ( = 0:9). In the second version, mismeasurement
starts at 10% in the …rst subsample then rises to 20% in the second subsample. In the third version,
mismeasurement starts at 10% then rises to 30%. These numbers are largely illustrative; note however
that the share in capital of measured “intangibles”, that is intellectual property products, is about 6%
recently. We are hence assuming that the unmeasured stock of intangible capital is signi…cantly larger
than the current measured stock, and has been rising importantly over the past 15 years.
Table 11 reports the parameter estimates and table 12 reports the implied moments corresponding to
di¤erent scenarios. There are a few interesting results. First, all parameters are completely una¤ected,
except for

and

: In particular, the increase in

and in risk are not a¤ected by these assumptions.

Second, when mismeasurement is constant at 10%, the model has similar implications to our baseline
model (the level of

is higher and the level of

lower, but the changes between two subsamples are

nearly identical). Third, the estimated increase in markup is smaller when there is an increase in
mismeasurement. For instance, with a mismeasurement rising to 30% of capital, the markup rises by
only 4.1 points instead of 6.6 points when mismeasurement is constant and 6.7 points in the baseline
model. This is intuitively consistent with the simple formula (29): with more mismeasurement, there
is less of a gap between the MPK and the risk-free rate to explain. The other implication is that the
estimated

rises. This is because the labor share rises with mismeasurement; to o¤set this, the model

needs an increase in capital-biased technical change, i.e.

:

Overall, in our most generous calibration, the rising mismeasurement explains 1.65 point increase
in the wedge, the markup now only 0.47 point, and the risk premium 2.08 points. Of course, the magnitude of the mismeasurement is di¢ cult to ascertain. But it is interesting that incorporating realistic
mismeasurement would reduce further the implied markup, while leaving the role of risk una¤ected.

6.6

Transitional Dynamics

Our calculations so far assume that the economy remains along its “risky balanced growth path”.
However, if the model parameters such as the discount factor or markup change, the economy will
experience a transition before it reaches its new balanced growth path. This transition may a¤ect our
estimation results.
To evaluate the importance of this bias, we estimated the model, taking into account the transitional
dynamics. Speci…cally, we make the following assumptions. We use the baseline version of the model
and assume that the economy starts in 1992 in balanced growth with the parameters that we estimate

over the …rst sample.25 We then assume that the nine parameters change linearly over 24 years (to end
in 2016) from the value we estimated in the …rst sample to a …nal value that we will estimate (and which
may not be our estimate for the second sample).
We then calculate the transitional dynamics for this economy using a standard shooting method. A
key issue is agents’expectations. With perfect foresight, the model cannot …t the data, because agents
see the lower interest rates coming, which leads to a boom in the price-dividend ratio. (Furthermore, the
long-term interest rate would fall signi…cantly more than the short rate, unlike what we see in the data.)
We hence assume myopic expectations: each period, agents observe the new values of the parameters,
and they assume (incorrectly, at least for the …rst 24 years) that these parameters will remain constant
forever.26
We then numerically …nd the …nal parameters such that, when calculating the transition, this procedure yields an average time series for our targets (over the period 2001-2016) that matches what we
measured in the data. Figure 13 presents the path obtained for parameter values and …gure 14 the path
for the moments targeted (we abstract here from parameters that map directly into moments). Table
13 presents the numerical counterpart to these graphs.
As can be seen in …gure 14, the model moments, averaged over periods 10-26 (i.e. 2001-2016), match
reasonably well the target moments for the second sample (in red). The more surprising result is in …gure
13, where we see that the parameter values estimated in this way are quite similar to these obtained in
the simple baseline model, which assumes balanced growth. To see this, note that the blue line, averaged

one exception is ; which now falls slightly instead of rising. Table 13 shows the same result: comparing
the third and fourth columns, the estimated parameters are quite similar, except for : We view this
results as suggesting that, at least in the myopic case, perhaps not much is lost by focusing on the risky
balanced growth path. This conclusion might not hold true for all models however; in particular with
intangibles if there is signi…cant accumulation during the transition.

Other evidence on market power, risk premia and intangibles

Our empirical results show that rising risk premia and rising market power appear to be two of the
signi…cant drivers of some of the macro-…nance trends we focus on, and intangibles have a potential
contribution as well. In this section we step outside of the model and present some simpler and independent evidence for these two phenomena. We also discuss some related estimates presented by other
researchers, which tend to support our conclusions.

7.1

Some empirical estimates of the equity risk premium

We …rst present some reduced-form estimates of the equity premium. Estimating the equity premium
is notoriously di¢ cult, even retrospectively. Using realized excess equity returns is essentially pointless

over short samples, because returns are noisy,27 and because an increase in the risk premium may lead,
by itself, to lower realized returns. But methods that use standard forecasting return regressions have
also been found to be very unstable; Goyal and Welch (2006) argue that none of them outperforms the
simple mean out-of-sample. Here we follow a few approaches which have been shown to be somewhat
more successful empirically.
Our …rst approach is simply to use the static Gordon growth formula, which states that the pricedividend ratio is the inverse of the di¤erence between the return on the asset and the dividend growth
rate:
P
1
=
;
D
R G
where R is the expected equity return, which can be decomposed into R = RF + EP; with RF risk-free
and EP the equity premium, and G is the growth rate of dividends. This approach can be used at any
point in time, given the observed P D and RF and given an assumption about G going forward. The
main di¤erence with our structural estimation above is that we use here data on dividends.
Our second approach builds on Fama and French (2002) who argue that, if the dividend-yield or
earnings-yield are stationary, as they ought to be, one can advantageously estimate the mean of Pt+1 =Pt
by Dt+1 =Dt or Et+1 =Et (which are less volatile). As a result, they suggest estimating
ERP = E

Dt+1
Pt

+E

Dt+1
Dt

E(RF );

which amounts to the Gordon growth formula, or replacing dividend growth with earnings growth,
ERP = E

Dt+1
Pt

+E

Et+1
Et

E(RF ):

This approach is best thought as applying to a long-sample average.
Our third approach follows Campbell and Thompson (2008) who show how combining the current
dividend yield and the return on book equity can be used to create a real-time estimate of the equity
premium:
ERP =

DE
+ 1
EP

D
E

ROE;

and where they suggest smoothing the payout ratio D=E, earnings-price ratio E=P; and the return on
book equity ROE to reduce the e¤ect of in‡uential but transitory observations.
These formulas can be applied either using arithmetic averages or using geometric averages. We
report both below in table 14, though we like Campbell and Thompson’s recommendation to use the
geometric averages. We then incorporate an adjustment of 1=2 the variance of stock returns to produce
an estimate of arithmetic equity premium.

The key observation from table 14 is that, while the estimates of the equity premium are clearly
di¤erent across models and methods, most calculations suggest that the ERP increased from the …rst
2 7 For

instance, suppose a researcher has a sample of 16 years (as we do) and that the excess equity return has a mean

of 8% with a volatility of 16%. The 95% con…dence interval for the mean excess equity return is [0%; 16%]: It is clearly
impossible to detect a change of the equity premium of even several percentage point based solely on realized returns.

sample to the second sample. Speci…cally, all nine estimates in bold are positive, ranging from 1.8%
to 7.2%. This re‡ects that valuation ratios increased moderately, while earnings or dividend growth
increased more signi…cantly, and the risk-free rate fell. (For this exercise, we take the risk-free rate to
be the 10 year Treasury yield minus SPF in‡ation expectations over the next 10 year.)
Figure 15 presents graphically estimates of the equity risk premium for each of the three approaches,
obtained over centered 11-year rolling windows. We smooth the estimates using a 3-year moving average.
Here too, the exact numbers vary quite a bit across models, but all models suggest some increase over
the past 15 years or so. (A particular di¢ culty is how one deals with the very low corporate earnings
in 2008 or 2009, which a¤ect the FF-earnings model signi…cantly, leading to the extreme arithmetic
implication in the middle panel.)

7.2

Other measures of changes in risk premia

We now discuss other evidence on the changes in the risk premium. Duarte and Rosa (2015) provides
an exhaustive survey of the di¤erent methods that can be used to estimate the equity premium in
real time. They distinguish between di¤erent methods based on variants of the Gordon growth model,
on predictive regressions, and on cross-sectional regressions. Overall, the conclusion is that the equity
premium has risen, in line with our …ndings.28 Campbell and Thompson (2008) propose a method to
estimate the equity premium in real time. Their estimate also shows a small increase after 2000. Using
2 8 An

earlier literature documented a decline of the equity premium decline during the 1980s and 1990s (Blanchard (1993),

Jagannathan and McGrattan (2000), Heaton and Lucas (1999), Lettau and Ludvigson (2007)), which is not inconsistent
with our results.

Table 15: The table reports the mean of various credit spreads and volatility measures for the samples
1984-2000, 2001-2016, and 2001-2016 excluding the June 2007-June 2009 period. The table also reports
the di¤erence between these means and a standard error (calculated using the Newey-West method with
12 monthly lags).
a very di¤erent methodology, based on a MLE estimation of a structural model, Avdis and Wachter
(2015) reach a fairly similar conclusion. Another important contribution is Martin (2015) who uses an
ingenious argument to provide, under a relatively weak condition, a lower bound on the equity premium
based on option data. His lower bound has a very high correlation with the VIX index. The estimate
is very elevated during the Global Financial Crisis, and remains at a higher level post GFC than pre
GFC. However, his lower bound is quite low in the mid-2000s. If the lower bound has a constant bias
with the mean, then this series does not behave like the other estimates we discussed above. However,
it is possible that the bias between the lower bound he …nds and the true expected equity premium is
time-varying.
Table 15 presents evidence on the evolution of some other measures of risk; the Gilchrist-Zakrajsek
spread, the standard BAA and AAA spreads, the VIX index, and stock market realized volatility
(calculated using daily data). The table reports the mean in the two samples, as well as the mean in the
second sample excluding the GFC period. We see that all these credit spreads have increased between
the two samples, and this conclusion is true even excluding the GFC period. Realized volatility is also
somewhat higher. The VIX index exhibits little trend (but is only available starting in 1996). These
results are consistent with Del Negro et al. (2017) who show that the premia for safe and liquid assets
increased over time.29

7.3

Independent evidence on risking markups

A number of recent contributions, using di¤erent methods, have found that average markups have been
increasing. For example, Barkai (2016) uses aggregate data and implements a user cost approach a la
Hall-Jorgenson (1967) to decompose the non-labor share into a true capital share and a pro…t share.
2 9 One

caveat is that the underlying riskiness of the …rms issuing corporate bonds may have changed over time, even

within credit ratings.

50

The true capital share is computed by multiplying the capital output ratio by the user cost of capital.
The pro…t share is a residual. The aggregate markup can be directly inferred from the pro…t share.
Because his measure of user cost does not incorporate a meaningful risk premium, Barkai …nds that
the evolutions of the user cost track those of the interest rate, and so that the user cost has declined
substantially over the period 1984-2014. This implies a large decrease in the capital share, a large
increase in the pro…t share, and a large increase in the aggregate markup of about 20% roughly in line
with our macro estimation.
De Loecker and Eeckhout (2016) use …rm-level data and estimate …rm-level markups using a production function approach which recovers markups as the ratio of the elasticity of production to a ‡exible
input the the share of that input in revenues, where the former is computed by estimating the production
function. The aggregate markup computed as a harmonic sales-weighted average of …rm-level markups
increases by about 25%. Traina (2018) criticizes the measure of costs used by De Loecker and Eeckhout (2016). Using a broader measure, he …nds that the increase in average markups is much smaller.
Gutierrez and Philippon (2016) also use …rm-level data but they estimate …rm-level markups using a
user cost approach allowing for sizeable and variable risk premia. They also …nd a sizeable increase in
aggregate markups of about 10% over the period 1984-2014, somewhat above our baseline results.

7.4

Rising Intangible Capital

There is a growing literature that recognizes the importance of intangible capital in the US economy.
Corrado et al. (2005, 2009) and Nakamura (2010) present estimates of the size of intangible capital.
Bhandari and McGrattan (2017) also contribute to this measurement. Koh, Santaeullia-Llopis and
Zheng (2015) argue that rising intangibles help explain the evolution of the labor share. Crouzet and
Eberly (2018) argue that growing intangibles help explain both the rising market power and lower capital
investment. Caggese and Perez (2017) show how growing intangibles may help account for some of the
same macro trends that we focus on in this paper.

8

Conclusion

We provide a simple accounting framework that allows decomposing the changes observed over the
past 30 years in some key macro-…nance trends into “semi-structural” parameters using a fairly clear
identi…cation. We say “semi-structural” because, allowing these parameters to vary over time ‡exibly
suggests they are not microfounded and invariant to policy. Yet we …nd the results useful because deeper
explanations have to be consistent with the changes of parameters implied by our approach.
We …nd that about half of the increase in the spread between the return on private capital and the
risk-free rate is due to rising market power, and half due to rising risk. Technical change plays little
role. Higher savings supply and higher risk are the prime proximate contributors to the decline of the
risk-free rate. Rising market power help explain the evolution of the capital share, pro…tability, and
capital accumulation, but its contribution is substantially overstated if the model is estimated using a
macro approach that abstracts from risk. Finally, taking into account intangibles reduces further the

51

estimated increase in the market power.
One limitation of our approach is that we treat the parameter changes as independent causal factors,
but they might actually be driven by common causes; for instance, higher market power might reduce
innovation and hence productivity growth, but we treat these as independent. Our analysis also does
not incorporate some factors which could help explain the evolution of some of the big ratios that we
study. In particular, we abstract from taxes and from agency issues (e.g. external …nance or corporate
governance frictions) or market incompleteness, that could also give rise to wedges that might vary over
time. Our study of transitional dynamics is only scratching at the vast possibilities. Finally, it would
be interesting to study these issues taking into account the speci…c open economy considerations or at
least to study these same facts for a variety of countries.

Appendix
Data appendix

Our data and programs are available online. This appendix details our variable construction. We give
Haver mnemonics. In many cases we have considered alternative series. However, because we focus
on the medium-run trends, di¤erences in cyclical behavior among series have little e¤ect on our target
moments.
- Real risk-free interest rate: in our baseline, we use the one-year Treasury constant maturity less
current in‡ation (fcm1@usecon minus ypcuslfe@usecon), though results are nearly identical if other
proxies for in‡ation are used, such as ex-post realized total or core in‡ation or the median 1-year ahead
SPF expected in‡ation. In the extension, we use also the AAA/AA FTSE index for corporate bond
yields minus the median 10 year ahead CPI expected in‡ation (syct5a@usecon - asacx10@surveys), and
we also use the 10 year interest rate minus SPF expected in‡ation minus the term premium measured
by Adrian, Crumb and Moench (fcm10@usecon minus asacx10@surveys minus facm10tv@usecon).
- Price-dividend ratio: we use the cum-dividend and ex-dividend annual returns from CRSP to
construct the price-dividend ratio.
- Labor share: we use the gross labor share for non…nancial corporations, de…ned as bncomp@usna
divided by (bngdp@usna minus bnytpix@usna minus bnbtrn@usna).
- Investment-capital ratio: for investment, we use total nominal …xed investment in private assets
over the corresponding capital stock measured at current cost from the Fixed Asset Tables of the BEA
(zpt@capstock over ep@capstock). These measures include both nonresidential and residential, and the
non-residential part includes equipment, structures and intellectual property products.
- Pro…tability: to ensure consistency between our measures, we construct pro…tability as the ratio
of (one - our measure of labor share) to the ratio of the capital stock (measured at current cost,
ep@capstock) to GDP (nominal, gdp@usna).
- Employment-population ratio: the ratio of civilian employment of people 16 years and over to
civilian noninstitutional population of people 16 years old and over, i.e. le@usecon to lnn@usecon.
These data are originally from the Current Population Survey.
- Population growth: the growth rate of lnn@usecon.
- TFP growth: we use Fernald’s unadjusted total factor productivity for the business sector. We
have also experimented with other TFP measures, with only minor e¤ects on our results.
- Investment price growth: the growth of the ratio of the chained index for …xed investment (jf@usna)
to the chained index of nondurable consumption and services.
- Leverage: for the extension with leverage, we use data from S&P to construct aggregate net market
leverage as the sum of current debt and long-term debt less cash equivalents, divided by the close price,
all on a per share basis, i.e. (lq500@spah + lt500@spah - aq500@spah)/pc500@spah.
- The empirical estimates of the equity premium in section 7.1 are constructed using monthly data
from Shiller. Following Campbell and Thompson (2009), we construct the payout ratio as the ratio of
a …ve-year centered moving average of dividends to earnings; and we use a three-year centered moving

57

average of earnings to book equity as the return on equity. We use CRSP daily data to calculate realized
volatility. The Gordon equity risk premium (ERP) is estimated as the average D=P + GD
GD is the growth rate of dividend. The Fama-French ERP is estimated as D=P + GE
is the growth rate of earnings. The Campbell-Gordon ERP is (:5D=P + :5E=P ) + (1
where

RF where

RF where GE
)ROE

RF

is the smoothed payout ratio.

- The data from section 7.2 are obtained from the Federal Reserve Board for the Gilchrist-Zakrajsek
series; and Haver for the BAA, AAA, and 10 year interest rate, and VIX. Realized volatility is calculated
using daily data from CRSP.

Model Appendix

The …rst subsection discusses aggregation. The second subsection lists the equations characterizing the
equilibrium. The third subsection shows how to solve the model. The fourth subsection provides some
formulas for the moments of the macroeconomic shock under various distributional assumptions.
10.2.1

Aggregation

Given our assumptions that capital and labor can be reallocated frictionlessly across …rms at the beginning of each period, and given the constant-return-to-scale technology, …rms face a constant (common)
marginal cost mct : Each …rm sets its price pit and output yit to maximize pro…ts, subject to its demand
curve:

max (pit

mct ) yit ;

yit ; pit

"

pit
Pt

s:t: : yit = Yt

;

where Pt is the price index, which we can normalize to one as a numeraire. This program leads to the
optimal markup, equal to the inverse of the demand elasticity:
pit

mct
pit

=

1
:
"

Hence all …rms set the same price, and in equilibrium we obtain that nit = Nt ; kit = Kt ; yit = Yt ;
pit = Pt = 1 and marginal cost is
mct =

"

1
"

:

Marginal cost can be calculated as the cost of expanding production using either labor or capital, or
mct =

wt
Rt
=
;
M P Nt
M P Kt

where wt is the real wage, Rt the rental rate of capital, and M P Nt and M P Kt are the marginal products
of labor and capital respectively. This leads to the …rst order conditions

Solution method

To solve the model involves solving for the constants y ; x ; k ; etc. that give the (log) intercept of the
solution for each of the macro variables, e.g.:
log Yt = log y + log St + log Tt :
To obtain these constants, we follow the standard procedure to solve the neoclassical model. We …rst
detrend the equations by Tt and St , taking into account the relation between gT ; gL ; gQ ; and gZ . The
Euler equation (7) is hence rewritten along the risky balanced growth path as:
!

which provides an equation in k given the parameters. We then obtain y

= k

N

from the

detrended production function and x from the detrended capital accumulation equation:
x = k ((1 + gQ )(1 + gT )
and …nally c = y

(1

)) ;

x : The calculation of the risk-free rate and price-dividend ratio follows immediately

from the formula for the SDF (12).
10.2.4

Explicit formulas for some distributions of macro shocks

The expressions for the “big ratios” involve expectations of the macro shocks

t+1 .

It is useful to

spell out these expectations in some interesting special cases. Technically, following Martin (2013), we
recognize that we can rewrite these moments using the moment-generating function, de…ned for x 2 R
as (x) = E (ex

t+1

) : In particular, de…ning b = (1 + gP C )

log RF =

log ERP = log (1) + log (

is a rare disaster, nothing in our analysis precludes

using a di¤erent distribution. One that is particularly tractable is the lognormal case, i.e.
with mean

and variance

2

: In particular, setting

2

is a pure risk shock
2

(i.e. in the sense of second order stochastic dominance). In that case, we have (x) = e

hence, as noted in section 3.4.1,

Another tractable case is the compound Poisson process. Suppose that for j

0;

j

Pr(

t+1

j!

e

;

i.e. instead of at most a single disaster realization per period, there are potentially several of these
shocks, and that the number of shocks follows a Poisson distribution, with intensity

p: (Because p

is small, this compound Poisson process case is very close quantitatively to the simple binomial case,
xb
1)
but leads to somewhat more elegant formulas.) The moment generating function is (x) = e (e

It is straightforward to extend this calculation to the case of random size of shocks b, as in Kilic and
Wachter (2017).
In our application we will assume that

t+1

follows a three-point distribution, i.e.

t+1

0 with probability 1

t+1

o¤sets the mean e¤ect of the disaster. One could also use a more traditional two-point process, without
the third state, which would then not satisfy E e

both a …rst moment and second moment e¤ect.
