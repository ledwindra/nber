Does Inflation Targeting Increase Output Volatility? An International
Comparison of Policymakers’ Preference and Outcomes
Stephen G. Cecchetti and Michael Ehrmann
NBER Working Paper No. 7426
December 1999
JEL No. E52, E58

ABSTRACT
Aggregate shocks that move output and inflation in opposite directions create a tradeoff between
output and inflation variability, forcing central bankers to make a choice. Differences in the degree of
accommodation of shocks lead to disparate variability outcomes, revealing national central banker’s relative
weight on output and inflation variability in their preferences. We use estimates of the structure of 23
industrialized and developing economies, including nine that target inflation explicitly, together with the
realized output and inflation patterns in those countries, to infer the degree of policymakers’ inflation
variability aversion. Our results suggest that both countries that introduced inflation targeting, and nontargeting European Union countries approaching monetary union, increased their revealed aversion to
inflation variability, and likely suffered most increases in output volatility as a result.

Introduction
Throughout the world, monetary policy regimes have changed dramatically over

the decade of the 1990s. Central banks have become more transparent, more independent, more accountable, and (apparently) more successful. The biggest transformation has been the move away from focusing on intermediate objectives, such as
money and exchange rates, toward the direct targeting of in°ation. In their survey
of the central banks in 77 countries, Fry, Julius, Mahadeva, Roger, and Sterne (1999)
¯nd that in 1990 only 4 of the (then 70) countries' central banks either had an explicit
monitoring range or an actual target for in°ation. By 1998, this number had risen to
40 (of 77).
This profound change in institutional structure has been accompanied by an
equally impressive improvement in economic performance. Across the set of 23 industrialized and developing countries that we study here, average in°ation fell from
8.65 percent per year for the ¯ve years ending in 1990 to an average of 3.53 percent
for the most recent ¯ve years for which we have data. Over these same intervals, real
growth (in industrial production) rose from 3.21 percent per year to 4.28 percent per
year.
The most interesting part of the story, however, concerns in°ation targeting, which
we might call the monetary policy framework of the 1990s. Included in our sample of
23 countries are 9 that have targeted in°ation explicitly, beginning in nearly all cases
in the ¯rst few years of the decade. Looking at Table 1, we see that for these countries
in°ation fell by more than 7 percentage points on average, from 10.82 percent in
the late 1980s to 3.41 percent in the latter part of the 1990s (Table 1). For the
nontargeters, the average reduction is 3.6 percent. To a very real extent, in°ation
targeting has achieved its primary objective | the lowering of in°ation.
There are many ways to portray a shift in monetary regime. One is to note that,
if the regime shift is real, it must represent a change in the preferences of the central
bank. This means that if we can use the outcomes of policy to infer the objectives of
the policymaker, then these objectives should have changed following the regime shift.

In°ation-targeting countries are Australia, Canada, Chile, Finland, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom. These are the nine countries, as classi¯ed by Morand¶
e and Schmidt-Hebbel (1999), where in°ation
targets are explicit and clearly dominate any other possible secondary target or objective. Nontargeting countries
are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal,
Switzerland and the United States. The standard deviation of real growth is computed as the deviation from the full
sample trend, using quarterly industrial production at an annual rate. The standard deviation of in°ation is computed
as the deviation from 2 percent. Sample periods vary slightly by country. See the appendix for details concerning the
data.

More speci¯cally, we might think of policymakers as choosing a point on an outputin°ation variability trade-o®, assuming that a trade-o® between these two exists. If
there is a stable trade-o®, then a move to in°ation targeting would be expected to
result in a move along this frontier to a point where in°ation is less variable and
output is more variable than it otherwise would have been. It is also possible that
operating on the frontier is di±cult, and that a shift in the policy framework could
act as a commitment mechanism, increasing credibility and allowing policymakers to
achieve better outcomes overall.
The breakdown of output and in°ation statistics in Table 1 supports the view
that in°ation-targeting countries have reduced in°ation variability at the expense of
an increase in output variability. Comparing the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, we see
¯rst that volatility in both output and in°ation fell in all countries in our sample,
suggesting that the 1990s have been relatively shock-free, and so overall performance
has been better in all countries. That is, aggregate supply shocks, which move output
and in°ation in opposite directions and force monetary policymakers to make choices,
may have been on average smaller (in absolute value) in the recent decade.1 For
this reason, it is the comparison of the targeting and nontargeting countries that is
important. Here we see that the standard deviation of in°ation fell more for the
targeters, and output variability fell less.
Figures 1 and 2 present the same information in a slightly di®erent way. In the
¯rst ¯gure, we plot the variance of in°ation (as measured by consumer prices) and
the volatility of output about its trend (as measured by industrial production) for
our sample of 23 countries.2 These outcomes depend on many things, including a
country's economic structure, its policy regime, and the actual pattern of shocks it
has faced. Nevertheless, we note that the pattern suggests the existence of a tradeo® because there seem to be groups of countries along concentric curves that move
radially outward from the origin.

Fry et al. (1999, p. 66) also make this point.
Countries with extremely high in°ation or output variability are truncated.

Figure 2 reports the experience of the in°ation targeting countries. We examine
the outcomes for 5 years before (indicated by solid diamonds) and 5 years after
in°ation targeting was implemented (indicated by solid circles). Here, we compute
the squared deviation of in°ation from 2 percent, which we assume to be near a likely
long-run target. If a country is initially operating on a stationary in°ation-output
variability trade-o®, then the shift to in°ation targeting would be expected to move
the point on the plot up (higher output variability) and to the left (lower in°ation
variability). This is the case for only 1 of the 9 countries we examine, New Zealand.
For the remaining eight countries, performance suggests that the move to in°ation
targeting came with an overall improvement in e±ciency.
Unfortunately, presenting the evidence in this way has a signi¯cant drawback. If
the overall level of shocks hitting the economy declines between the two periods we
compare, both in°ation and output variability will fall, and a point on the plot will
move toward the origin (down and to the left). For this reason, we must develop a
more disciplined approach to the data, one based on an economic model.
In the remainder of this paper we pursue this approach, estimating the changes
in policymakers' revealed preferences to see if the outcomes in in°ation-targeting
countries are likely to have come from an increase in the weight attached to in°ation variability in policymakers' objective function. We do this using the technique
described in Cecchetti, McConnell, and Perez Quiros (1999), who note that if we
assume policymakers are acting optimally, then their actions reveal their objectives.
The method is as follows. Beginning with a simple loss function that represents tradeo®s among combinations of output and in°ation variability, we can treat policy as a
solution to a control problem in which the interest rate path is chosen to place the
economy at the point on the variability frontier that minimizes this loss. In e®ect,
we deduce from the data what policymakers' preference must be. The data is used to
go backwards. First, we estimate the structure of the economy in each country. This
tells us the available frontier for each country. From this, and the actual output and
in°ation outcomes, we can estimate the relative weight that national central banks

6

implicitly have placed on output and in°ation variability in the formulation of their
policies.
The remainder of the paper is in four sections. In Section 2, we present a simple model that allows us to relate output and in°ation outcomes, together with the
economic structure, to a policymaker's preferences. Section 3 reports estimates of
the structural vector autoregressions that give us the raw material we need to estimate preferences. The task of Section 4 is to report estimates of the policymaker's
implied objective function in a sample of 23 countries. Most important, we see how
these objective functions vary across targeting and nontargeting countries and how
they have changed over time. Our conclusion is that the targeting countries have, on
average, moved along the available frontier in a way that reduces in°ation variability (signi¯cantly) and increases output variability (slightly) above what it otherwise
might have been. Interestingly, the same is true of the nontargeting European Union
(EU) countries, who necessarily increased their focus on in°ation as they approached
the start of monetary union on January 1, 1999.

Formulating the Policymaker's Problem
When making policy, central bankers consider large masses of information in an

e®ort to meet what are often multiple objectives. It is impossible to write down the
process in terms that are amenable to analytical study. To make any progress at all,
we must begin with a number of assumptions that clearly result in a model that is
unrealistic. Our hope is that our results capture some critical aspect of the problem
actually being addressed.
We follow textbook analyses at the outset by assuming that central banker's objectives can be written as a simple quadratic loss function.3 That is, the policymaker
seeks to minimize the discounted sum of squared deviations of output and prices
3

The model here was ¯rst presented in Cecchetti, McConnell, and Perez Quiros (1999) and is
based on Cecchetti (1998).

from their target paths. The general form of such a loss function (measured over a
medium-term horizon of three or four years) can be written as
L = E[®(¼ ¡ ¼ ¤ )2 + (1 ¡ ®)(y ¡ y ¤ )2 ] ;

(1)

where E denotes the mathematical expectation, ¼ is in°ation, y is the (log) of aggregate output, ¼ ¤ and y ¤ are the desired levels of in°ation and output, and ® is the
relative weight given to squared deviations of output and in°ation from their desired
levels.4 The parameter ® is the crucial quantity of interest, and we will call it the
policymaker's aversion to in°ation variability.
Several issues arise immediately when we write down equation 1. First, the objective function is symmetrical, including only quadratic terms. The implication is
that policymakers are equally averse to extreme positive and extreme negative events.
This is surely not the case: we would expect policymakers to take action when the
mean and variance of forecast distributions are likely to stay the same, while the
probability of some extreme bad event increases. That is, even if the variance is
unchanged, an increase in the possibility of a severe economic downturn is likely to
prompt action.
We also note that the loss function includes only output and in°ation, and not
exchange rates. The rationale for this is our belief that domestic in°ation and output
are the fundamental concerns of policymakers. The decision to focus on the exchangerate path in the formulation of policy is, in our view, the choice of an intermediate
target. Policymakers are not concerned with the behavior of intermediate targets
per se, but with the domestic in°ation and growth outcomes produced by their use.
Exchange-rate targeting is analogous to monetary-aggregate targeting. Both imply a
certain behavior for output and in°ation, and an objective function such as equation 1.
Returning to the issues at hand, we contend that the policymaker's problem cannot
4

This loss function can be written in a more complex, dynamic form in which a discount factor
and an horizon appear explicitly. In addition, we could add a term that makes changes in interest
rates explicitly costly. These re¯nements do not add to the analysis here.

be solved without knowledge of the dynamics of the output and in°ation, and their
relationship to the interest rate (rt ) instrument controlled by the policymaker. We
write these in the following simple way:
yt = ¡°(rt ¡ dt ) + st ;

(2)

¼t = ¡(rt ¡ dt ) ¡ !st

(3)

and dt and st are aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks. These are the
fundamental sources of exogenous disturbances to the economy.5 The parameter °
gives the ratio of the responses of output and in°ation to a policy shock and can be
thought of as the inverse of the slope of the aggregate supply curve. The parameter
! is the slope of aggregate demand.
Note that the relationship linking output, in°ation, and interest rates can be
described in many ways, most of them very complex. What is important for our
purposes here, and what is captured in equations 2 and 3, is the notion that there are
two kinds of disturbances that bu®et the economy and require policy responses. The
¯rst type of shock | the aggregate demand shock | moves output and in°ation in
the same direction; the second type of shock | the aggregate supply shock | moves
output and in°ation in opposite directions. Policy is capable only of moving output
and in°ation in the same direction, and so is analogous to an aggregate demand
shock. It is the aggregate supply movements that create the essential dilemma for
policy, because they force a choice.
The fact that the policymaker's objectives are assumed to be a simple function
of the variances of output and in°ation, and that the structure of the economy is
assumed to be linear, means that the optimal policy response to demand and supply
5

Equations 2 and 3 can be thought of as the time-averages of the vector-moving-average representation of a structural vector autoregressive model. Thus, our model, while apparently simple,
does not restrict short-run dynamics.

9

shocks is a simple linear rule. We write this as
rt = adt + bst :

(4)

It is now straightforward to solve for the rule. The result is that policy o®sets aggregate demand shocks one-for-one, and so a is equal to one. As expected, the response to
supply shocks is more complex, because they create a trade-o® for policy. The extent
of the reaction depends on the economic structure as measured by the slopes of the
aggregate demand (!) and aggregate supply curves (°), as well as the policymaker's
aversion to in°ation variability (®).6
The optimal policy has several implications for the variability of output and in°ation. First, both depend only on the variance of aggregate supply shocks, not on the
variance of demand shocks.7 This follows immediately from the fact that the optimal
policy rule dictates that demand shocks be o®set completely by interest rate moves.
Second, changes in the volatility of aggregate supply shocks shift the variance of output and in°ation in the same proportion.8 As a result, we can derive the following
ratio:

¾¼
°(1 ¡ ®)

(5)

This expression has several interesting properties. First, we note that when ® = 0
(the policymaker cares only about output variability), ¾y2 =¾¼2 = 0. Likewise, for ® = 1
(the policymakers cares only about in°ation variability), ¾y2 =¾¼2 = 1. Signi¯cantly,
varying ® between zero and one allows us to trace out the entire output-in°ation
variability frontier, the shape of which is related to the slope of the aggregate supply
The resulting expression is given by b¤ = [¡®! + (1 ¡ ®)°]=[® + (1 ¡ ®)° 2 ]. We also note that
it would be possible to rewrite the rule (4) in the form used by Taylor (1993). To accomplish this,
simply note that, using the expressions (2) and (3), the supply shock st can be written in terms of
output, yt , and in°ation, ¼t . Simple substitution would then allow us to rewrite the policy rule in
terms of output and in°ation directly | the form of a Taylor rule.
7
The resulting expressions are ¾y2 = (1 ¡ °b¤ )2 ¾s2 and ¾¼2 = (! + b¤ )2 ¾s2 , where ¾s2 is the variance
of the supply shocks and b¤ is the optimal reaction to st given in footnote 6.
8
This means that the variability frontier as drawn in Figures 1 and 2 of the introduction does
shift with the variance of supply shocks, making those pictures more di±cult to interpret.

the variance of aggregate supply shocks.
Figure 3 plots two representative frontiers to show how the slope depends on °.
The solid line plots a frontier for a country with a relatively °at aggregate supply
curve (° = 5), while the dashed line depicts the frontier for a country with a steeper
aggregate supply curve (° = 1) (recall that ° is the inverse of the slope of the aggregate
supply curve).9 The implication is that if a country faces a relatively °at aggregate
supply curve, reductions in in°ation variability will be accompanied by relatively large
increases in output variability, making in°ation targeting more di±cult.
We will use equation 5 to estimate the policymaker's revealed aversion to in°ation
variability, ®. First, however, we need to know °, which we will estimate in Section 3,
and the ratio of the variance of output and in°ation, which we will obtain from the

Table 3 reports the estimates of ° for the countries we study. The case of ° = 5 is close to that

data. With these two quantities in hand, we can compute an estimate of ®.

Measuring the Impact of Policy
The next task is to measure the impact of policy on output and in°ation. That

is, we need to identify and estimate a model that allows us to measure the monetary
transmission mechanism. Numerous studies report such estimates for various sets of
countries.10 We choose to apply the methodology used by Ehrmann (1998) in his
study of European countries, to a broader cross-section of countries. This approach
yields a series of estimates, all based on the same methodology, for a set of 23 countries, including 9 that target in°ation explicitly. Also, the estimated models can be
carefully tested for structural stability and adjusted to ensure that they are stable
over the samples for which we estimate them. It is also important that our models
yield a complete set of responses to the shocks we identify and that these models
conform to our priors with regard to the type of shock being identi¯ed.11 In practice,
these last requirements are extremely di±cult to meet.
Methodologically, our approach is based on the structural VAR (vector autoregression) techniques devised by King, Plosser, Stock, and Watson (1991) to identify
monetary shocks from a combination of long-run and short-run restrictions. For each
country, the model has either four or ¯ve variables, including output, in°ation, and an
interest rate, and, with the exception of Japan, Switzerland and the United States,
an exchange rate. When a ¯fth variable is present, it is either a monetary aggregate, a second interest rate or a commodity price index. The methods and model
speci¯cations are described in detail in the appendix. Here we simply report the
results.
Figure 4 plots the responses of output (the solid lines) and in°ation (the dashed
lines) to an interest rate increase of 100 basis points for the 23 countries in our
10

See the references in Cecchetti (forthcoming) for a representative sample.
In particular, it is important for our purposes that all shocks in the system, not just the money
shock, produce plausible impulse response functions.

The sacri¯ce ratio is computed as the cumulative output loss per percentage point reduction in in°ation over a horizon
of 12 quarters. The inverse aggregate supply slope is the 12-quarter average of the impact of policy innovations on
output, divided by the 12-quarter average impact on in°ation. See the appendix for details of the estimation of the
models. The average for the "Other Countries" excludes Portugal.

sample. For the purpose of comparison, we have plotted all of the results on the same
vertical scale. The patterns vary quite dramatically, with the interest rate changes
eliciting a much larger response in Germany and Switzerland than in Israel or Mexico.
Table 2 summarizes the results from the ¯gures. For each country, the table also
reports estimates of the sacri¯ce ratio, and an estimate of the inverse slope of the
aggregate supply curve (°), which we need to infer the policymaker's preferences,
and an estimate of the sacri¯ce ratio. The sacri¯ce ratio is the cumulative percentage
loss in output for a 1-percentage point reduction in in°ation. Here we compute the
sacri¯ce ratio over a horizon of 12 quarters.
The numbers appear to be both reasonable and similar across the targeting and
nontargeting countries. With the exception of Portugal, all of the numbers are plausible. For the remaining countries, the sacri¯ce ratio ranges from 0.4 for Austria to
10.4 for Germany. The estimate of ° has a similar variation, from 13.7 for the United
Kingdom to 0.13 for Belgium (again ignoring Portugal). While there is modest evidence that interest rate increases yield a bigger output response and a smaller implied
sacri¯ce ratio in the in°ation-targeting countries, the results are far from conclusive.

4

Policymakers' Aversion to In°ation Variability
We are now ready to estimate policymakers' aversion to in°ation variability (®).

Equation 5, together with estimates of the aggregate supply slope and the ratio of
the variance of output and in°ation, yields an estimate of ®. In calculating the
ratio of in°ation volatility to output volatility, we must make an assumption about
the paths of desired in°ation and output (¼ ¤ and y ¤ in equation 1). Throughout the
analysis we take the desired measure of output variability to be the actual trend in the
sample. This assumption tends to minimize the estimated `variance' of output, and
so measures of ® will be higher than they otherwise would be. In Table 3 we report
results for two assumptions about the desired level of in°ation: (1) it is equivalent
to average in°ation in the sample or (2) it is a ¯xed level of 2 percent. The results

16

for the second assumption are always higher, because the use of the sample mean
in°ation reduces the squared deviations.
The ¯rst thing to notice about the results is that most of the ®'s are quite large,
suggesting that many of these countries have taken the goal of in°ation stability very
seriously over this period. When desired in°ation is assumed to be 2 percent, 14
of the 23 countries have estimated ®'s of 0.70 or higher, and half of these exceed
0.9.12 The only country that appears not to be averse to in°ation variability at all
is Mexico, with an estimated ® of 0.08. Beyond this, the average for the in°ationtargeting countries is no di®erent from that of the countries that for the nontargeting
countries.
The estimates in Table 3 are interesting, but since they are computed over the
full samples for which data are available, they do not allow us to infer the e®ects of
changes to in°ation targeting. For this reason, we now shift to computing estimates
of ® using subsamples of the data. Figures 5 through 7 plot the results of an exercise
in which we compute the value of ® for ¯ve-year moving windows. Throughout, we
assume that desired in°ation is 2 percent, and that the estimate of ° is unchanged.13
On each graph we include a horizontal line for the value of ® computed from the using
the full sample, as reported in Table 4. For the in°ation-targeting countries in Figure
5, the vertical line represents the date at which the new regime was introduced.
The results in the ¯gures are quite striking. For 7 of the 9 in°ation-targeting countries, the estimate of the aversion to in°ation variability rises substantially either prior
to or immediately following the time the targeting regime is implemented (Figure 5).
12

As noted in Cecchetti, McConnell, and Perez Quiros (1999), the use of industrial production to
measure output is likely to produce values of ® for these countries that are upper bounds on the true
value. We would expect that a shift to GDP, which is nearly uniformly less volatile, would raise our
estimate of the absolute value of ° and reduce our estimate of ¾y2 =¾¼2 . For any given value of ¾y2 =¾¼2 ,
a higher ° will imply a higher value of ® since the slope of the output in°ation-variability frontier at
that point will be steeper. Thus, both of these e®ects serve to raise the value of ® relative to what
we would obtain using GDP.
13
As noted in Section 3, we took care to examine each of our structural models for stability, and
so we are reasonably con¯dent that we have obtained stable estimates of the aggregate supply slope.
Even so, small changes in ° would not e®ect our results, as this simply serves to scale the level of
®, not a®ecting the changes.

\® after the shift" is the ® for the ¯ve years following the shift, or the last available ¯ve-year period when data are
not available.

The exceptions are Israel, where the estimate of ® falls following implementation, and
the United Kingdom where there is no discernible pattern.
Of the 9 EU countries that have not explicitly targeted in°ation in the 1990s, all
but one show an increase in the estimate of ® beginning in the early 1990s similar
to the increase for the in°ation targeters (Figure 6). Interestingly, the exception
is Germany. We conclude that in preparation for monetary union, the countries of
the EU were forced to behave more like in°ation-targeting countries throughout the
1990s. Germany, however, softened its previous hardline view toward in°ation, both
because of the implications of uni¯cation and as a compromise in the direction of its
future EMU colleagues.
For the remaining 5 countries in our data set, the results are mixed (Figure 7).
While the estimates of the aversion to in°ation variability for the United States and
Mexico rise, the estimates for the other countries show declines of varying degree.

In°ation-targeting countries are Australia, Canada, Chile, Finland, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the

¯ve-year periods before and after the explicit announcement of a move to in°ation
targeting. Of the 9 countries in the sample, 6 show an increase in the estimate of ®.
For the other 3, there are modest declines.
We now conduct one ¯nal test to determine whether the changes in the in°ationtargeting countries can in fact be ascribed to the targeting regime itself. For this test,
we use the remaining 14 countries in our sample as a control and examine the values of
® as they changed from 1990 to the end of the available sample. The results, reported
in Table 5, show that over the full sample for which we have data, the values of ® are
highest in the \EU Nontargeting" countries. The principal ¯nding, however, is that
in°ation-targeting countries show a signi¯cant average increase, from an average of
0.63 to an average of 0.76. In addition, the other EU countries show an increase in ®
from 0.75 to 0.83. The countries in neither category show a modest decrease.14

14

A simple regression of the change in ® on dummy variables for in°ation-targeting and EU
nontargeters shows that these declines are statistically signi¯cant at the 5 percent level, for the
targeters, and at the 10 percent level for the nontargeting EU countries.

Conclusions
This paper asks if in°ation targeting increases output volatility. Most macroe-

conomists assume that in the presence of aggregate supply shocks | short-run disturbances that move output and in°ation in opposite directions | monetary policy
must allow either output or in°ation to move away from its long-run desired levels. In
other words, there is a variability trade-o®. One interpretation of a move to in°ation
targeting is that the preferences of monetary policymakers have changed, with many
central banks exhibiting increasing aversion to in°ation variability and decreasing
aversion to output variability. It is natural to conclude that the outcome should be
higher output volatility than would otherwise have occurred.
We estimate the change in the preferences of monetary policymakers in a crosssection of 23 countries, including 9 that target in°ation explicitly. We ¯nd evidence
that in all countries, whether they target in°ation or not, aversion to in°ation variability increased during the decade of the 1990s. Furthermore, we conclude that the
in°ation targeters increased their aversion to in°ation volatility by more than the
nontargeters, although the di®erence is modest.

Appendix
A1: Estimation and Identi¯cation Strategy
To estimate the structural responses of each economy to a monetary policy shock,
we use structural vector autoregressions (SVARs).

A detailed discussion of our

methodology can be found in Ehrmann (1998), so we provide only a quick overview
of the estimation strategy. We apply a procedure set forth in King, Plosser, Stock,
and Watson (1991).15 The KPSW identi¯cation strategy is based on the implications
of the cointegrating relations, in a multivariate system. Complete identi¯cation of
an n-variable structural system requires

h

n(n¡1)
2

i

restrictions. In a system with m

cointegrating relations there will be k common trends, where k = n ¡ m and thus k
shocks that are assumed to have long-term e®ects on the variables in the system (and
are therefore interpretable as supply shocks). This structural assumption imposes
k ¤ m of the necessary restrictions. For complete identi¯cation of the e®ects of supply
shocks we need

h

k(k¡1)
2

i

additional restrictions. The KPSW methodology employs a

triangular speci¯cation, allowing the ¯rst shock to have a contemporaneous e®ect on
all the dependent variables, the second on the last n-1, and so on. In order to identify
the transitory shocks (interpretable as demand shocks), we need a set of additional

h

m(m¡1)
2

i

restrictions. We again use a triangular speci¯cation, and we identify the

monetary policy shock by assuming that it has no contemporaneous (within-quarter)
e®ect on output.

A2: The Models
Appendix Table A1 contains detailed descriptions of each model. Brie°y, for each
country, our model consists of four or ¯ve variables. For each country, we include
a short-term interest rate (the policy variable) as well as a measure of output and
a measure of in°ation (the quantities in the policymaker's objective function). In
15

For the analytical derivation of the KPSW procedure, see there or Warne (1993).

25

addition, for all countries but the United States, Japan, and Switzerland, we add
the exchange rate of the national currency against the currency of a large trading
partner. In the case of the members of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism,
this is the exchange rate with the deutsche mark. For the remaining countries, it is
either the Japanese yen or the U.S. dollar exchange rate. When a four-variable system
creates puzzling responses, a ¯fth variable is chosen from a pool of candidates: longterm interest rates, U.S. or German short-term interest rates (for countries strongly
in°uenced by the U.S. or German monetary policy setting), commodity prices as a
leading indicator for in°ation16 or monetary aggregates. All data are quarterly, at
annual rates, and seasonally adjusted using deterministic dummy variables.
The models are tested for structural breaks with the help of one-step Chow tests
and break-point (N down) Chow tests, both on the equation and the vector level.
Especially for some European countries, the tests reveal structural breaks around
1984, coinciding with the emergence of the \hard" European Monetary System. To
ensure that models are stable and well speci¯ed, for most countries the samples are
restricted to 1984-97. In some cases, the results of the stability tests led us to make
the sample period shorter. To make sure we do not distort the evidence, we thus have
to accept small samples.
The lag length for the reduced-form vector autoregressions is found using the
London School of Economics general-to-speci¯c modeling strategy. In all cases, a lag
length of at most two is su±cient. We perform a number of additional diagnostic
tests to ensure that the models are well speci¯ed. We test the residuals of both the
individual equations and the systems as a whole for serial correlation, non-normality,
heteroskedasticity and autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH).17
16

Since they are determined in auction markets, commodity prices react much faster to news
about future in°ation than do industrial or consumer prices. Econometric evidence supports their
value as leading indicators of in°ation (Boughton and Branson[1991]). Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Evans (1996) discuss the usefulness of commodity prices in estimating the responses of output and
in°ation to monetary policy shocks.
17
For a detailed description of the tests, see the help function in PcFIML9.0; the test statistics
are available from the authors upon request.

26

In most cases, we must introduce dummy variables for our models to pass this
battery of stringent speci¯cation tests. This is especially true of the tests for normality
of the residuals. We introduce dummy variables in periods where indirect taxes are
increased, under the presumption that central banks do not generally tighten policy
at these times, even though measured in°ation is normally observed to rise. We also
include dummy variables at the times of the 1992-93 and 1995 exchange-rate crises,
when many countries' central banks changed their behavior drastically, albeit brie°y.
Finally, dummy variables are put into the models at times of extraordinary national
events, such as labor strikes. Appendix Table A2 reports the full list of dummy
variables included for each of the countries we study.

Data for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom are from Datastream; those for
Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United States are
taken from the OECD Main Economic Indicators. Data for Chile are from International
Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics (deposit rate), the Central Bank of
Chile's WWW-homepage (in°ation), and from DRI (industrial production, exchange rate);
Israeli data are taken from DRI (exchange rate, industrial production, and in°ation) and
from IFS (interest rate, money). Korea's data are taken from IFS (money-market rate,
industrial production) and DRI (in°ation and exchange rates).
1 The model for Chile looks at parts of the transmission mechanism only, because the
interest rate in use is a deposit rate. This assumes that the transmission from monetary
policy shocks to the deposit rate has already taken place.
2 ALP is a monetary measure of active liquidity in private hands. It is de¯ned as a broader
aggregate than M3. To construct real ALP, the natural logarithm of the CPI is subtracted
from the natural logarithm of ALP.
3 Retail prices on all items excluding mortgage interest. Because the U.K.-CPI includes
mortgage interest payments, CPI in°ation is biased upward following an interest rate increase. To avoid a price puzzle, the interest payments have to be excluded from the price
index.
