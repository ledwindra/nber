March 1989
IS THE BANK OF JAPAN A CLOSET MONETARIST?

MONETARY TARGETING IN JAPAN, 1978-1988
AZS TRACT

This paper investigates whether the Bank of Japan has practiced a
nionetarist rule since 1975. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) published a report in
1975, stating that it would pay close attention to money supply (M2), and in
1978 started announcing quarterly the "forecast" (targets) of monetary (M2)

growth rate. Since 1975. the monetary growth rate has gradually declined,
and inflation has subsided without causing a major fluctuation in output.

This seems to be a successful case of the monetarist experiment. Has the EOJ
practiced a monetarist rule, i.e., an announcement and maintenance of the K2
growth target?
This paper reveals that it has not. The BOJ "forecasts" were quite

accommodative in that an unexpected increase in actual money supply would

make "forecasts" to allow a further increase in money supply. In other
words, a "forecast" did not behave like a "target" under a strict monetarist

rule. Testing a monetarist rule with "forecasts" is shown to be more
powerful than testing with the actual process, under some weak assumptions.

One of the necessary assumptions is that "forecasts" are rational
expectations, and the rational expectations hypothesis is not rejected by the

data. Thus, the conclusion of this paper is negative to a question posed by
its title.

"Japan illustrates a policy that is less monetarist in
rhetoric than the policies followed by the United States and
Great Britain but far more monetarist in practice."
(Milton Friedman (1985, p.27))

"[T]he Bank of Japan is now at its zenith as far as the
autonomy of monetary policy is concerned. ... Japan's
monetary management after the second oil crisis can be
regarded as one of the most successful such experiences in
any industrialized country. (Hamada and Hayashi (1985; p.83))

"targets"?

Were "forecasts" by the Bank of Japan disguised

Was the target steady? Did the Bank of Japan conduct the

policy to keep the money supply within the specified range? If monetarism

prevailed in Japan from 1975 to 1986, was it abandoned in 1981 when the
actual money supply soared? These questions will be investigated in the
following sections.

In order to focus on money supply targeting, other

interesting aspects regarding the Japanese monetary policy will not be
discussed in the paper)'1

A main focus and contribution of this paper is an anlysis of the
"forecasts" announced by the Bank of Japan. One might think that it is more

important to examine whether an "actual" process, as opposed to "forecasts"

process followed a monetarist rule. An attempt of a monetarist rule is one

thing and an actual implementation is another. However, there are twc
reasons to prefer "forecasts" in the test of a monetarist rule.

First, e

"forecast," a target of money supply, contains less noises than an outcome.

Actual money supply may deviate from a target due to unexpected demant
(credit

niu.ltiplier) shocks.

Hence, econometric

investigation

using

"forecasts" would have a better fit and serve a more powerful hypothesis

testing (see Section 3).

Second, monetarists always argue that it is

important not only to practice but also announce it beforehand a stable
monetary policy. Therefore, if a monetarist rule is intended and attempted,

it should appear in the "forecasts." The "forecasts" by the Bank of Japan,

which, contain a grain of "targets," provide us with a rare opportunity tc
test, in a pure form, a monetarist rule.

2. Overview: U.S. vs Japan
2.A. United States: the Rise and Fall of Monetarists, 1.979-1982

The U.S. had conducted monetary policies in more or less a Keynesian
manner, with the interest rate targeting, throughout the l960s and l970s.
After the sharp increase in the inflation rate in late l970s, the Federal

Reserve announced on October 6, 1.979, a "new operating procedures" which

sounded like an implementation of monetarism.

Chairman, Paul Volker,

announced a major change in monetary policy "to support the objective of
containing growth in the monetary aggregates... by placing greater emphasis

on the supply of bank reserves and less emphasis on confining short-term
fluctuations in the Federal funds rates."

The target cone for Ml was announced and efforts were made to keep Ml
within the range. However, the actual path of Ml broke out of the cone too
frequently.

The weekly money supply announcement was closely watched by

the market in order to forecast the Fed reaction to the surprise in money
supply.

Many studies, such as Engel and Frankel (1984), Ito and Roley

(1985) and Roley (1983), established evidences that the market believed

'-3—

that the Fed will tighten after an unexpected increase in money supply.

Inflation fell but

only

after the United States experienced the

recession of 1981-82, the worst since the Second World War.

The Fed

permitted the money supply to increase beyond its target after the summer
of 1982, and the policy implemented in October 1979 was formally abandoned

in October 1982. After the monetary target was abandoned, money supply
increased at a faster pace: Ml increased only at 6.5% in 1981, but it grew
8.8% in 1982 and 9.7% in 1983. Despite repeated warnings from monetarists,

inflation did not materialize from a higher growth rate of money supply.

At present, Ml target is no longer announced.

Monetarism has been

pronounced "dead" for some time (Dewald (1988) and. B. Friedman (1988)).

Milton Friedman was skeptical about the prospect of practicing a
monetarist policy in October 1979, and quickly disinherited the Fed from
monetarism. As early as December 1980, Milton Friedman complained that the

Federal Reserve had failed to keep its promise of October 6, 1979

(See

M. Friedman (1980)). Monetarists claimed that, despite the monetarist

rhetoric, the Fed failed to implement a monetarist policy.

The Fed

permitted Ml to fluctuate widely and even allowed it to swing outside the

target range. Thus, monetarists and sympathetic observers argue that the
experience from 1979 to 1982 was nothing like monetarists would advocate.
(See McCallum (1984, 1985) and Milton Friedman (1984, 1985).)

Nonnionetarists concluded from the experiment that it is neither
possible nor desirable to target the money supply. The monetary tightening

in 1981 due to an unrealistic goal in Ml growth hurt the economy.
Moreover, nonmonetarists argue that no inflation with a high monetary
growth rate after 1982 is a solid evidence that monetarism is wrong. (See,
for example, Benjamin Friedman (1984, 1988).)

2.3. Japan: Was the Bank of Japan a closet Honetarist?
Between 1956 and 1973, the Bank of Japan permitted monetary growth to
fluctuate between fifteen and twenty-five percent per annum. The Bank cur-

tailed monetary growth when the international balance of payment became a

binding constraint, but otherwise relaxed monetary growth to finance
economic growth. In 1972, the HZ growth rate reached 26.5 percent.

When

the oil embargo of October 1973 hit Japan, an inflation pressure was
already there. A combination of domestic overstimulation, a mistake of the

Bank of Japan, and quadrupling of oil prices caused the worst inflation
since the 1950s. The WPI inflation soared to 31 percent in 1974.

In order to curb the high inflation rate and to prevent its resurgence, the Bank of Japan decided to put more emphasis on money supply in
Japan.

The Bank of Japan (1975) analyzed the causal relationship between

monetary aggregates and income. and derived a conclution that M2 had always

led the price level (WPI). In its manifesto, the Bank of Japan (1975)
announced that it would watch the the money supply growth more closely:
"In order to achieve price stability and to strive for the appropriate

development of the economy, it will be necessary to pay sufficient
attention in the future to the movements of 142 in the management of
monetary policy. ... Since the relationship between 142 and ultimate
policy objectives may change depending on regimes of the economy, it
is an inappropriate policy management to announce and to machanically
stick to the target of M2 growth rate.

In actual management of policy, the growth rate of the money
supply should be kept stable in cases when it is judged that no
particularly large economic problems loom, ... Money-focused monetary
policy in no way implies decreased importance for intereat rate
policy." (Bank of Japan (1975; pp. 10-11) and Bank of Japan (1987;
p.328 for translation of part of the above quote))

Since 1975, the Bank of Japan has declared HZ as an intermediate
target, and gradually decreased its growth rate. Fluctuations in the money

—5—

supply have also been curbed as evident in Figure 1. The figure shows that
money supply growth rate was gradually declined, and so was the nominal CNP
growth rate, but importantly keeping the real GNP growth rate steady.

Put

simply, the gradual decrease in the money supply growth rate reduced
inflation without reducing economic growth. This is what a monetarist would

preach.'

Is the Bank of Japan a closet monetarist? Milton Friedman, a

founding father of monetarism, thinks so. As shown in his quote in the
beginning of this paper, Friedman praises the Bank of Japan for "practicing"
-

monetarism without vocalizing it.

Insert

principle, without announcing it, in 1987, when the M2÷CD

rate

jumped to 10.4 percent from 8.7 percent in 1986. However, a care must be
taken in the comparison of the monetary policies by the Fed in 1979-1982,

and by the Bank of Japan in 1975-1986, since there are some technical
differences in monetary targeting of the two central banks.

First, the

Bank of Japan has targeted the M2+CD, while the Fed targeted Ml. The Bank
of Japan thinks that Ml is more volatile in nature, and it is difficult to

target Ml or its relation to income and inflation is weaker. Second, the
Federal Reserve announced the actual statistics weekly, while the Japanese
monetary announcement comes only monthly. Announcements of weekly volatile

movements might cause jitterly reactions from the market. Third, it is
cosmetic, but the Bank of Japan announces its statistics in terms of annual

increases

instead of the week-to-week changes.'

Last, but

most

important, the Bank of Japan may not have treated its M2+CD "forecast" in a
way that the Federal Reserve treated Ml as a "target."

3. Econometric Issues
In

this subsection, econometric specifications of various

tests

performed in the next two sections are formalized and explained. First, the

money supply growth, 11(t), is the linear function of economic conditions
known at period t, consisting of a vector of public information, PIJ(t-l), and

that of private information of the Bank of Japan, PR(t-l), and economic
conditions developed in period t P13(t) and the Bank of Japan contemporaneous
(within period t) decisions PR(t-l):

(3.1)

11(t) a

k + b*PU(t-l) + c*PR(t-1) + d*PU(t) + f*fl(t) + u(t)

where u(t) is the disturbance term representing the unexpected errors in
controling money supply within period t, so that u(t) has a zero mean and is
uncorrelated with any of the right-band-side variable variables.

The past

public information vector, PU(t-l), includes, for example, the past money
supply growth rates, M(t-l), M(t-2), ...,

GNP

growth rates, inflation rates

and other publicly available variables on economic conditions. The private
information PR(t-l) includes (i) financial market information that the Bank

of Japan collects but does not release to the public at the tine of
Hforecasta annoucements, and (ii) any monetary policy instruments that the
Bank of Japan has decided, but unknown to the public, to exercize in the next

three months. Changes in economic conditions in period t are divided into

the expected (at period t-l) part that is included in b*PU(t-l) and the
unexpected part,

P11(t).

Similarly, policy actions, affecting the money

supply, taken by the Bank of Japan in period t consists of the expected part

included in c*PR(t-l) and the unexpected part, PR(t).
E{Ptf(t)

PR(t-1), PU(t-1)] — 0 and E[PR"(t)

(3.2)

E(M(t):zoJI :

EFn(t):puct-l),PR(t-l)1

a k + b*P1.J(t_l) + c*PR(t—l).

However, the econometrician who is not informed of PR(t-l) would calculate
the expectation of the money supply growth using public information only:

(3.3)

E[N(t)lecJ a Ic +

b*PU(t-l).

Assuming that PR(t-l) and PU(t-l) are orthogonal, unbiased estimate of k and

b can be obtained easily. The forecast (target) money supply growth rate,
announced by the Bank of Japan for period t

(3.4)

TG(t) — f + 6*pU(t..,1)

is

denoted by TG(t):

+ &*PR(t..l) + w(t)

where Ic is a constant, the error term w(t) represents rounding errors (in

deciding "forecasts") and other "trembling-hand" disturbances in setting
targets, which has mean zero and is uncorrelated with any information which
is available at period t-l. Since TG(t) is announced, the last equation can
be easily estimated by the econometrician, if a private information set PR(t-

1) is either empty or is uncorrelated with PU(t-l):

(3.5)

TC(t) a k +

v(t)

6*P1J(t_l) +

where the disturbance term v(t) includes errors due to the

private

information of the Bank of Japan and u(t): v(t) a &*PR(t-l) + w(t).

Coefficients, k, 6, and & do not necessarily coincide with the
coefficients of the actual money supply, Ic, b, and c unless the Bank of Japan

announce the "forecasts,

which is the best forecast based on their

information available at that time, i.e., TG(t) a E[M(t)B0JJ, ("forecasts"
being "rational expectations"). This is examined and tested in Section 5:

(3.6: RE) k —

k,

—

c.

When rational expectations conditions are satisfied, a monetarist rule

is better tested with information TC(t), intention, on the left hand side
rather than 11(t).

This can be easily understood by comparing the two

regression equations that the econometriciart will use:

(3.1)

TC(t) —

k + b*PU(t-l) +
where v(t) —

(3.8)

11(t) —

k + b*PU(tl) +

c*PR(t-l)

+

u(t),

z(t)

c*PR(tl)

+ d*PU(t) +

f*PR(t)

+

u(t).

In order to estimate and interpret k and b, the first equation is more
efficient because its error term has less noises.

This justifies the

procedure taken in Section 4, that is, I use "forecasts" announced by the

Bank of Japan rather than the actual money supply data in the test of
-

monetarist rule.
One

may wonder what determines the relative accuracy of the Bank of

Japan announced "forecasts" against the econometrician's forecasts.

The

forecasts error of the "forecasts" announced by the Bank of Japan is

If the announced "forecasts" are rational expectations of the Bank of Japan,
i.e., (3.6) is the case, then the forecast errors can be reduced

In Section 4, the target function (3.5) is estimated and interpreted.

This

is a test of monetarist rule at the level of intention. It is not necessary

for the test to be valid that the target process is consistent with a true
process.

A monetarist rule is interpreted and tested at the level of

'forecasts." As described above, testing using TG(t) is more powerful than
using M(t) under the rational expectations assumption.

Section 5 is devoted to'an examination of various assumptions on which

the above test is constructed. Section 5.A estimates equations (3.7) and

(3.8) and obtained a better fit for equation (3.7), confining the above
theoretical prediction about why using TG(t) is better than 11(t). In Sec-

tion 5.B, the rationality of the Bank of Japan "forecasts" is directly
tested. If rational expectations (3.6) are true, the forecast errors 11(t)TG(t) is unbiased and uncorrelated with any variable contained in in.forma-

tion set PU(t-l) and PR(t-l). Usual tests are performed to confirm this
hypothesis. Therefore, this enhances the validity of procedure followed in
Section 4.

In Section 5.C, the importance of the private information PR(t-

errors,

FER(tBOJ) and FER(t ec) are compared. In the test, TC(t) is shown to be
more precise than E[H(t)PtJ(t-l)J in terms of the mean absolute (forecast)
error.

In other words, the announced forecasts' TG(t) is

forecasting variable than one constructed by the econometrician.

4• "Forecasts" by the Bank of Japan

4.A. Official Description
Targeting and control of money supply by the Bank of Japan seems to be

at the heart of its conduct of the monetary policy that has received such

praises from monetarists and others. First of all, let us review how the
Bank of Japan itself described the forecasts.

In its publication, the Batik of Japan explains why it adopted "money-

focused monetary policy" and how it is exactly implemented (Suzuki (1987;
pp. 328-311).

The following is a summary of the officiaL explanation

concerning its "forecast" announcement.

On the basis of these ideas, a change in monetary management occurred
in Japan, beginning in July 1978. Since that time, the Bank of Japan
has made it a rule to annuonce, at the beginning of every quarter, an
estimated value for the growth rate of the average outstanding balance,
of the money supply relative to the same period in the previous year.
This estimated value is called a forecast (mitoshi] and applies to the
current quarter. Originally, the definition of the money supply used
was M2, but the definition was changed to M2+CDs when the latter began
to be issued fin Nay 1979]. (Suzuki (1987), p. 328)
(T]he annual rate of increase is the focus of attention. ... Monetary
policy in Japan focuses on M2+CDs but does not determine 'targets' in
the strict sense of the word.
are
Only 'forecasts' fmitoshi]
announced. However, the policy actions of the Bank of Japan itself are
included in the determination of these forecasts, and in this sense the
forecasts represent increases in the money supply that the Bank of
Japan is willion to permit. (ibid, p.331)

The above descriptions tantalize the reader, who insists on knowing
whether "mitshi" is a "forecast" or a "target."

One way to resolve this

issue is to examine characteristics of "forecasts" and to determine whether
"forecasts" deserve to be monetarist "targets."

summarized in Table 1. Figure 2 plots the actual rate (solid line) against
the wean of the forecasts. The difference between the mean of forecast and

actual growth rates are shown in the "shock" column of Table 1 and the
vertical difference of the two lines of Figure 2. Table 1, the "large shock

column" also show that

the

actual path strayed outside the forecast range

only eight times in ten years. Notable deviations, three straight quarters
of under-forecasting, occurred in 1987.

Insert Table 1 and Figures 2 about here

A few caveats are in order. First, in the original announcement, the
range of "forecasts" are not officially specified in numbers. Instead, only

descriptive verbal expressiohs of the range (e.g. "about" 10 percent) are
announced. The expression is interpreted numerically, using common sense of

the language, (e.g. "about" — +1- 0.5 percentage point), and the ceiling,

mean, and the floor of the forecasts are recorded. This interpretation is

explained in Note 2 of Table 1.

Second, since the announcement is

deliberately vague as expalined above, some rounding errors in announcement
are inevitable. For example, even if the Bank of Japan predicts E(H(t)IB0J)

the growth rate to be "10.18% +/- 0.48%," the Bank announces uses the
language, TG(t), "about 10%." The same announcement TG(t) may result from

E(M(tflBoJ) —

"9.89% +/-

0.46%." This is one of the sources of an error

term w(t) in equation (3.4).

Third, in the official announcement, forecasts and actual (realized)
rates are described in terms of growth rates (in percent) over the last four

quarters. Denoting the announced (mean) forecast of growth rate by TO, the
level of Ff2 by Ff2, and the Bank of Japan "forecast" of Ff2 for this quarter
by EN, the definition is shown as,

happened, it is no wonder that the forecasting record, Table 1 and Figure 2,
appears to be very good.

(ii) Quarter-to-Quarter Basis
As noted above, when a. quarterly forecast over the 12-month growth rate

forecast is announced, the last three quarters are known. Therefore, there

is a possibility that

the

announced forecasts mask a subtle change (or no

change) of "forecasts" in the quarter-to-quarter basis.

This will be

explained in detail in next subsection.

The actual growth rate for the last quarter is announced at the same

time the "forecast" for this quarter is announced, and it is trivial to
calculate a quarter-to-quarter forecasts. Denoting the quarter-to-quarter
growth rate by QTG, the relationship is summarized as

The
the

implied quarter-to-quarter forecasts decreased from 8.30% (86:4) to 6.69%

(87:2) and then jumped to 10.30% (87:3). Since there was a large jump in
actual rates in 86:3 and 87:1, even a small rise in four-quarter growth rate

in 87:2 implies a decline of the growth rate in the quarter-to-quarter
growth rate, Similarly, from 88:2 to 88:3, the quarter-to-quarter (mean)

growth rate does not change, while the' four-quarter (mean) growth rate
registers a 1.5 point drop.
Since the quarter-to-quarter basis contains more net information, most
analyses in the following uses this definition. Regressions using the f our-

quarter basis are also done, but does not present any different stories, so

Let us investigate how a new "forecast" is formed when the most recent

"forecast error" is revealed. Reactions of the monetary authority to
forecast errors reveal how monetary policy, is conducted. A monetarist rule

will prescribe a compensating decrease in the next quarter to a positive
forecast error, in order to keep a k% growth rate in the target period, say
a year.

hypotheses, consider the following example.

Suppose that the level of monetary supply, after detrending the kX, was

targeted to be constant for the last four quarters. The actual path was
right on the target from t-4 to t-2. But it was just revealed that money
supply jumped by I X from t-2 to t-l,

(See Figure 4.) In the beginning of

period t, that is when an official "forecast" is announced, how does the
Bank of Japan target the money supply for that quarter?

Insert Figure 4 about here

There are three scenarios: Case 1 (Coinp1ete Accomodation). If the trend

is considered to be set and accommodated, the quarter-to-quarter growth rate
will be "forecasted" as 1% again from t-l to t; Case 2 (Bygones are bygones,

but no further accommodatiL If the jump was judged to be caused by a onetime idiosyncratic shock, the monetary authority may want to keep the money

supply constant after rebasing; and Case 3 (Rigid Monetarism). If a rigid

monetarism is pursued, then the positive jump should be compensated by a
following negative jump to keep the long-run trend target is kept.

In addition to these three hypotheses, another interesting hypothesis

is that the money supply target is independent of economic conditions.
According to a rigid monetarism, money supply should be independent from

economic growth or inflation. Hence, target adjustments should also be
independent from either of them.

If money supply management follows fine-

tuning as advocated by Keynesians, the money supply target will react to
conditions of inflation and growth.

The following two specifications are investigated.

e(t).

The (4,5) specification uses information of money

growth rate and others from t-2 to t-1.

In the (4.6) specification,

qu.ater].y growth rates from t-S to t-4, from t-4 to ti, from t-3 to t-2, and

from t-2 to t-1 are separately taken into account.'.

Results of specification (4.5) and (4.6) are shown in Tables 3 (with
one lag) and Table 4 (with four lags), respectively. Table 3 shows that b
is estimated to be between 0 and 1. The hypothesis that

the

estimated b is

equal to zero is rejected at the St level in most specifications.

The

estimated b being larger than 0 implies that a recent "surprise" increase in

actual money supply would make the next 'forecast" to increase beyond what

has already happened (bygones). Table 4 shows that even if four lags are
allowed, the sum of coefficients on the past forecast errors are between
zero and one. Again, a hypothesis that the estimated b is equal to zero is

rejected at the St level in all specifications. Without information of
inflation or GNP growth rate, the sum of point estimates of bj. j—l,2,3,4,

is .71. This implies that if an increase in money supply above its target
by one percent will make the long-run target to increase by about 70 percent

in addition to adjusting the base of target to a realized level of money
supply. This is a strong evidence for an accommodative policy in the money
supply management.

Therefore, evidences are against a hypothesis that the Bank of Japan

practiced a strict monetarist rule. The estimated b implies that any
increase in the level of money supply is treated as bygones, and moreover a

2/5/89

-

further increase will be accommodated. It is also shown that b is less than
1, so that a jump in money supply partially but not totally makes the trend

of increase.

(In terminology of Figure 4, the finding implies that the

reality is somewhere between case 1 and case 2.)

Insert Tables 3 and 4 about here

Insignificant estimates of c and d in Table 3 suggest that recent
inflation or real CUP growth rate does not add any information to the recent

"forecast errors."

The last finding is a piece of evidence that goes

against a hypothesis that the Bank of Japan practiced the quarter-to-quarter

fine-tuning responding to inflation and CUP growth rate.

The size of

accomodation, b, is quite robust in to different specifications with respect

to inflation and CUP growth. In Table 4, the magnitude of accommodation,

that is the sun of bj's does not change much, even if inflation and
economic growth rates in the past four quarters are also taken into account.

The sum of coefficients on inflation is .24. That is, "forecasts" of money

supply would increase if inflation becomes higher. This is hardly antiinflationary.

However, the coefficients of inflation are collectively

insignificant at the 5% level, and significant only at the 10% level. Table

4 also shows that the CUP growth rates are insignificant, though a sum of

coefficients is negative, in determination of targets.

When lagged

inflation and growth rates are collectively evaluated, it is not significant
at the 5% level (as shown in the last row of Table 4).

In sum, we learn that the Japanese monetary policy was conducted in
such a manner that was far from the monetarist k% rule.

When an actual

money supply deviated from a target, there was no effort, expressed in

J-ECONOM; MONEY-3.TXT

forming the next target, to correct the deviation. A jump was not only
treated as a bygone, but also prompt a further jump in the same direction in
the future target. Neither inflation nor GN'P growth rate did not affect the
change in money supply target.

In the United States from 19Th to :982, the market correctly believed

that the Fed was conducting the strict monetary targeting, in that any
unexpected increase in the money supply (out of the "cone") would be pulled

back by a compensating decrease in money supply in the near future.

In

other words, the market rationally expected that the estimate-of b in the
quarter-to-quarter regressions above to be significantly negative. Thus, as

many studies showed, the interest rate and the exchange rate responded to
the unexpected change in money supply within hours of money announcements
during the monetarist regime in the tJiiited States.

However, in Japan, an

unexpected change in money supply announcements have not caused any response

in the exchange rate movements. (See Ito and Roley (1985) and references
therein.)

The Japanese market was rational, in knowing that the Bank of

Japan would not try to compensate a surprise by a revease movement of money
supply in the near future.

5. Rationality of "forecasts
In the preceding section, it was shown that "forecasts" did not behave

like an announcement of kZ rule. If the Bank of Japan's "forecasts" were
not a monetarist targets, what were they? Is there any chance that an actual

path of money supply has followed a monetarist rule despite an accomodative

targeting rhetoric? This section will examine how forecasts were determined

and whether they were "rational," in that the forecast reaction function
was a correct conditional expectation of the true money supply process.

5.A Determinants of "forecasts" and actual money supply
In this subsection, the actual and "forecast" money supply growth rates

are regressed on the same information set, in order to investigate whether

they respond similarly to past information. This is also an indirect test
whether the Bank of Japan forecast is biased in any significant manner.

Table 5 shows the estimated processes of actual money supply and
"forecast" money supply, in terms of the growth rate (panel 1) and the level

(panel 2). These tables show how similarly the "forecast" (target) and the
actual process responded to past information. The Chow test iè performed to
check whether there are structual differences between the two processes.

Insert Table 5 about here

Results can be interpreted as follows. First, the "forecast" equation

has a higher

than that a "actual" equation, supporting that an actual

process contains more noises than a "target" process (as discussed in
Section 3). Second, the actual process responded negatively to inflation,

while the "forecast" process did not (in growth rates) or did so but in a
smaller coefficient. Third, coefficients other than inflation are similar

in magnitude.

Fourth, both the actual and "forecast" processes show the

long-run effect (sum of the coefficients) of the lagged money supply
close (.703 vs. .827 in growth rates and 0.986 vs. 0.961 in levels).

is

The

Chow test shows that there is no statistically significant difference
between the two processes (both in growth rates and in levels).

These

results imply that there are no significant deviations in the two processes,
so that the Bank of Japan did put their hands where their mouth was.

Rationality Test

5.B

A direct test of hypothesis that the Bank of Japan forecasts is a best
conditional expectation given the information at the time of forecasting can

be formulated as the usual test of "rational expectations."

If rational

expectations in the above sense holds, the "forecasts" are an unbiased

predictor of ex as realized values (unbiasedness test).

Moreover,

rational expectations imply that forecast errors are not correlated with any

information which is available at the time of prediction (orthogonality
test),

Each test is performed both in terms of growth rates- and in terms

of levels and results are shown in Table 6.

Insert Table 6

When the growth rate is used, the rational expectations hypothesis is
not rejected at the 5% significance level. When the level is used, the null
hypothesis is not rejected at the 1% significance level, but barely rejected

at SX significance level. Considering that the growth rate is used for an
official anr.ouncement, a rational expectations hypothesis is judged to be
accepted.

In sum, an assumption that the Bank of Japan is announcing what

they consider the best conditional estimate of money growth rate.

As explained in Section 3, the information set on which conditional
forecasts are based contains the Bank of Japan private information.

The

private information possibly includes its policy action to be exercised in

the next few months, but not yet announced. In the null hypothesis of
rational expectations, "forecasts" is formed taking into account the private

information, although the econometrician does not know its content. In that
sense, having "forecasts" announced by the Bank of Japan is a powerful test.

In fact, the procedure above is reminiscent of testing the rational

expectations hypothesis with "survey data" (see Mishkin (1983)).

5.C. Were the Bank of Japan "forecasts" better than mechanical forecasts?
As explained n Section 3, if we find an econometric model (eq. (3.11))

which performs significantly better than the EoJ forecasts (eq. (3.9)), it

implies that either the Bank of Japan deliberately announces "biased".
forecasts (which is unlikely on the basis of the evidence in the preceding
subsection) or the private information is valuable enough to compensate for
rounding errors in announcement.

After

some experiments, I produced two simple models that trace the

actual path of money supply reasonably well.

Model 1 is simply a

autoregressive model of the level of quarterly money supply, and Model 2
uses information of both money supply and real GNP. The second model also
include the trend term. In both cases, the rolling regression is performed

The BoJ

forecasts are better than the econometrician's best effort, although the
performance edge does not seems to be overwhelming. There are several ways
to interpret these results. The results imply that an importance of having

private information, PR(t-l) outweighs the possibility of non-honest
announcement, i.e., i

6

1 b,

c; the rounding errors w(t), and that

the econometrician may have imprecise estimates due to small samples, i.e.,

k 0 k,

c.

Put differently, if rational expectations (3.6: RE)

is given, and if the econometrician has true parameter values, then the
results show that PR(t-l) is very important in forecasting the money supply

process. Yet another way of interpreting results is to regard results as a

support of rational expectations (3.6 RE), given that there are a few
variables which are private information of the Bank of Japan and that the

econometrician can try many specifications. For if rational expectations

were violated and if the information value of PR(t-l) was small, the
econometrician would be able to obtain a better forecasting formula using
?U(t-l) after many experimentations.

6. Concluding Remarks
Findings in this paper suggest that the Bank of Japan did not practice

what monetarists preached, contrary to a praise from U.S. monetarists.
Although the Bank of Japan announced a "forecast" which could be taken as
monetary targeting, the forecasts were flexible so that they would violate a

rigid monetarist rule. In particular, when there is an unexpected jump in
money supply, the base is adjusted to a new level (bygones are bygones) and
a further accomod.ation (b>O) in growth is allowed in the new "forecasts."

"Forecasts' by the Bank of Japan are found to be best conditional
forecasts by the Bank of Japan, because the rational expectations hypothesis

Money-4.txt

22 -

is not rejected. The actual and "forecasts" processes responding to various

public information are very similar.

Hence, non-monetarist "forecasts"

announcements can be regarded as a true reflection of the actual managment

of money supply.

(As explained in Section 3, there is an econometric

advantage to use "forecasts" rather than cx post money supply.) The Bank of
Japan "forecasts" are better than mechanical forecasts, suggesting that the
private information of the Bank of Japan is important.

In the United States, it is acknowledged by many researchers that the
monvement of monetary aggregates during the monetarist experiment of 1979-82

has no resemblance to what monetarists preached, leaving a question whether

a monetarist rule was attempted and failed or it was not intended at all.
This paper shows that even in Japan, that the monetarists and sympathisers

regard as a dream land, monetarism in the strict sense was not practiced.

In fact, the Bank of Japan is not a non-monetarist in practice, but is
hesitant to look a non-monetarist in announcement. This is most evident in
its announcement form, the four-quarter growth rate, which hides the large
fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter growth rate forecasts.

One might wonder what made monetarism (or rhetoric of monetarism) gain

a popularity at one point in both the United States and Japan, and why the
idea is not completely dismissed by the central banks. The answer could be
political

rather than economic:

money growth was a convenient means of absolving itself from responsibility

for the record-high interest rates that occurred." According to this view,

3.

It would be interesting to study whether there are "real" differences

in the practices of the Bank of Japan and the practices of the Federal

Reserve after correcting for these differences. For example, had the
Federal Reserve announced monetary growth only monthly instead of weekly,

while compensating secretly week-to-week monetary fluctuations within the

month, would it have been more stabilizing to the economy? There is an

evidence in the foreign exchange market during the 1979-82 that the
Japanese monetary announcements were more or less ignored as "news," while

the Fed's monetary announcements were watched closely as"news" (Ito and
Roley (1985)) becoming a source of exchange rate fluctuations.

4.

If we may interpret "forecasts" as 'targets1" and jump to a

conclusion, the Bank of Japan is judged to have resisted to a faster money

supply growth until 87:3 by targeting a deceleration of money growth.
Observing the large jump of 87:1, the Bank tried to slow down the money
supply in 87:2. Finally, in 87:3, the target followed the actualy trend.
This is hardly obvious, if we only watch the announced "forecasts" in terms

7.

An oral tradition among experts on the monetary policy suggests a

similar story in Japan. The Bank of Japan was politically defeated in 1972

and was "forced" to lower the discount rate against its will. If the Bank
had bad a sufficient political power to increase the discount rate then, the

great inflation of 1973-74 would have been averted. Therefore, having money

supply established as a "target," the Bank now has a contingent weapon in
order to implement a necessary tightening (or interest rate hike) when it is
needed.

If this scenario is true, then I regret that, by writing this

paper, I will weaken the political power of its weapon protecting its
-

autonomy.

However, unlike in 1972, the Bank of Japan has well established

its credential by now, especially for its successful management, via fine-

tuning not monetarism, through the period of second oil crisis, 1979-80.
Thus, the Bank of Japan should realize that it could stand strong without a
safety blanket of money supply targeting.

Thus, original statistics are M2 before 1979:3 and M2+CD on and
