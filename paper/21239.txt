The Impact of Pharmaceutical Innovation on Premature Cancer Mortality in Canada, 2000-2011

ABSTRACT
The premature cancer mortality rate has been declining in Canada, but there has been considerable
variation in the rate of decline across cancer sites. I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation
had on premature cancer mortality in Canada during the period 2000-2011, by investigating whether
the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in the premature
mortality rate, controlling for changes in the incidence rate.
The estimates imply that pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996 reduced the number
of years of potential life lost to cancer before age 75 in 2011 by 105,366. The cost per life-year before
age 75 gained from previous pharmaceutical innovation is estimated to have been 2730 USD. The
evidence suggests that, even if these drugs had been sold at branded rather than generic prices, the
cost per life-year gained would have been below 11,000 USD, a figure well below even the lowest
estimates of the value of a life-year gained.

Introduction
Previous authors have argued that “reducing premature mortality is a crucial public health

objective” (Renard, Tafforeau, and Deboosere (2014)). A widely used measure of premature
mortality is years of potential life lost (YPLL) before a given age (e.g. age 75), i.e. the number of
years not lived by an individual who died before that age (Association of Public Health
Epidemiologists in Ontario (2015)). Statistics of YPLL are published by the World Health
Organization, the OECD, and government agencies of Canada, the U.S., and other countries.
Burnet et al (2005) argue that YPLL “should be considered when allocating research funds.” In
the U.S., “cancer [was] responsible for more [YPLL] than all other causes of death combined” in
2008 (National Cancer Institute (2015c)). In Canada, premature (before age 75) mortality from
cancer is about twice as great as premature mortality from circulatory diseases.
But as shown in Figure 1, the premature cancer mortality rate has been declining; it
declined about 20% between 1996 and 2006. The cancer incidence rate remained approximately
constant during that period.
While the premature mortality rate from all cancers combined has been declining in
Canada, Figure 2 indicates that there has been considerable variation in the rate of decline across
cancer sites. During the period 2000-2011, the premature mortality rate from breast cancer
declined 20%, and from cancer of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue declined 27%, but
the premature mortality rate from lip, oral cavity, and pharynx cancer increased 6%, and from
cancer of female genital organs increased 8%. I will show that this variation in the rate of
decline of premature mortality cannot be explained by variation in the rate of decline of
incidence.
In this paper, I will analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation has had on
premature cancer mortality in Canada during the period 2000-2011. 1,2 The analysis will be

Lichtenberg (2014b) analyzed the impact of pharmaceutical innovation and other types of medical innovation on
cancer mortality in the U.S. during the period 2000–2009. But as the Commonwealth Fund (2011) demonstrated,
the U.S. health care system differs dramatically from the health care systems of other OECD countries, including
Canada. For example, in 2008 per capita spending on health was 85% higher in the U.S. than it was in Canada.
Also, the outcome measure and the measure of pharmaceutical innovation used in the present study will differ from
those used in Lichtenberg (2014b).

I use the sample period 2000-2011 to avoid potential discontinuities in the mortality data, because Canada used the
ICD9 cause-of-death classification during 1979-1999, and the ICD10 cause-of-death classification during 20002011.

performed using a difference-in-differences research design based on longitudinal disease-level
data. In essence, I will investigate whether the cancer sites that experienced more
pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in the premature mortality rate, controlling for
changes in the incidence rate. Figure 3 illustrates that the rate of pharmaceutical innovation, as
measured by the number of drugs registered during the period 1988-2013, varied considerably
across cancer sites. Only 5 drugs for cancer of the eye, brain and central nervous system were
registered, while 19 drugs for cancer of digestive organs were registered.
The analysis will be based on aggregate data—longitudinal data on 15 cancer sites3—
rather than patient-level data. Stukel et al (2007) argue that comparisons of outcomes between
patients treated and untreated in observational studies may be biased due to differences in patient
prognosis between groups, often because of unobserved treatment selection biases. I believe that
difference-in-differences estimates based on aggregate panel data are much less likely to be
subject to unobserved treatment selection biases than estimates based on cross-sectional patientlevel data.4 Moreover, the outcome measures that we analyze (premature mortality rates) are not
subject to lead-time bias.5
In Section II, I describe an econometric model of premature cancer mortality. The data
sources used to construct the data to estimate this model are described in Section III. Empirical
results are presented in Section IV. Key implications of the estimates are discussed in Section V.
Section VI provides a summary and conclusions.

Premature cancer mortality model

In his model of endogenous technological change, Romer (1990) hypothesized an
aggregate production function such that an economy’s output depends on the “stock of ideas”
3

The 15 cancer sites are the 15 malignant neoplasm ICD-10 blocks defined by the World Health Organization.
Jalan and Ravallion (2001) argued that “aggregation to village level may well reduce measurement error or
household-specific selection bias” (p. 10).

Survival time for cancer patients is usually measured from the day the cancer is diagnosed until the day they die.
Patients are often diagnosed after they have signs and symptoms of cancer. If a screening test leads to a diagnosis
before a patient has any symptoms, the patient’s survival time is increased because the date of diagnosis is earlier.
This increase in survival time makes it seem as though screened patients are living longer when that may not be
happening. This is called lead-time bias. It could be that the only reason the survival time appears to be longer is that
the date of diagnosis is earlier for the screened patients. But the screened patients may die at the same time they
would have without the screening test. See National Cancer Institute (2015a).

that have previously been developed, as well as on the economy’s endowments of labor and
capital. The premature mortality model that I will estimate may be considered a health
production function, in which premature mortality is an inverse indicator of health output or
outcomes, and the cumulative number of drugs approved is analogous to the stock of ideas. The
first model will be of the following form:
ln(YPLL75st) = k CUM_NCEs,t-k +  ln(INC_RATE75st) + s + t + st

(1)

where
YPLL75st = years of potential life lost before age 75 from cancer at site s per
100,000 population age 0-74 in year t (t = 2000,…,2011)
CUM_NCEi,t-k = ∑d INDds REGISTEREDd,t-k = the number of new chemical entities
(drugs) to treat cancer at site s that had been registered in Canada by the end
of year t-k
INDds = 1 if drug d is used to treat (indicated for) cancer at site s
= 0 if drug d is not used to treat (indicated for) cancer at site s
REGISTEREDd,t-k = 1 if drug d was registered in Canada by the end of year t-k
= 0 if drug d was not registered in Canada by the end of year t-k
INC_RATE75st = the average annual incidence rate of cancer at site s per 100,000
population age 0-74 in years t-5, t-4,…,t-16
i = a fixed effect for cancer at site s
t = a fixed effect for year t
Inclusion of year and cancer-site fixed effects controls for the overall decline in premature cancer
mortality and for stable between-disease differences in premature mortality. A negative and
significant estimate of k in eq. (1) would signify that diseases for which there was more
pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in premature mortality. The functional form of
eq. (1) has the property of diminishing marginal productivity: the absolute reduction in
premature mortality declines with each successive increase in the number of drugs.
As illustrated by Figure 4, the data exhibit heteroskedasticity—diseases with larger mean
premature mortality rates had smaller (positive and negative) annual percentage fluctuations in
6

The most recent available incidence data are for the year 2010.

4
YPLL75. Eq. (1) will therefore be estimated by weighted least-squares, weighting by the mean
premature mortality rate during 2000-2011 ((t YPLL75it) / 12). The standard errors of eq. (1)
will be clustered within cancer sites.
Although one would expect an increase in true cancer incidence to increase premature
cancer mortality, cancer incidence rates are subject to measurement error, so one should not
necessarily expect the coefficient on measured cancer incidence () to be positive. Let I and I*
represent measured and true cancer incidence, respectively. Then I = (I / I*) × I*, and log(I) =
log(I / I*) + log(I*). Measured cancer incidence can increase for two reasons: an increase in true
cancer incidence, or an increase in the ratio of measured incidence to true incidence. The latter
could occur as a result of increasing quantity or quality of cancer screening. More and better
cancer screening could lead to earlier diagnosis, which might reduce premature mortality.
Therefore the effect on premature mortality of increases in I* and increases in (I / I*) may offset
one another: the former is likely to increase premature mortality, but the latter may reduce it.
For this reason, although controlling (in an unrestrictive manner) for measured incidence in the
premature mortality model seems appropriate, we should not be surprised if we don’t find a
significant effect of measured incidence on premature mortality.
Estimation of eq. (1) enables determination of how much of the decline in Canadian
premature mortality during the sample period (2000-2011) can be attributed to the introduction
of new drugs. The expression (2011 – 2000) indicates the 2000-2011 decline in premature
mortality, controlling for (holding constant) the number of drugs and cancer incidence, i.e., in the
absence of pharmaceutical innovation. Suppose eq. (1) is estimated, excluding CUM_NCEi,t-k,
and that the year fixed effects from that equation are denoted by ’t. Then ('2011 – '2000)
indicates the 2000-2011 decline in Canadian premature mortality, not holding constant the
number of drugs, i.e., in the presence of pharmaceutical innovation, and ('2011 – '2000) - (2011 –
2000) is an estimate of the 2000-2011 decline in premature mortality attributable to
pharmaceutical innovation.
The measure of pharmaceutical innovation in eq. (1)—the number of chemical substances
previously commercialized to treat a disease—is not the theoretically ideal measure. Premature
mortality is presumably more strongly related to the drugs actually used to treat a disease than it
is to the drugs that could be used to treat the disease. A preferable measure is the mean vintage
of drugs used to treat a disease, defined as VINTAGEit = ∑d Qdit LAUNCH_YEARd / ∑d Qdit,

5
where Qdit = the quantity of drug d used to treat disease i in year t, and LAUNCH_YEARd = the
world launch year of drug d.7 Unfortunately, measurement of VINTAGEit is infeasible: even
though data on the total quantity of each drug in each year (Qd.t = i Qdit) are available, many
drugs are used to treat multiple diseases,8 and there is no way to determine the quantity of drug d
used to treat cancer at site s in year t.9 However, it is shown in Appendix 1 of Lichtenberg
(2014a) that there is a highly significant positive correlation across drug classes between
changes in the (quantity-weighted) vintage of drugs and changes in the number of chemical
substances previously commercialized within the drug class.
Pharmaceutical innovation is not the only type of medical innovation that is likely to
contribute to premature mortality. Other medical innovation, such as innovation in diagnostic
imaging, surgical procedures, and medical devices, is also likely to affect premature mortality.
Therefore, measures of these other types of medical innovation should be included in the eq. (1).
Unfortunately, longitudinal disease-level measures of non-pharmaceutical medical innovation
are not available for Canada. But failure to control for non-pharmaceutical medical innovation is
unlikely to bias estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on premature mortality, for
two reasons. First, pharmaceuticals are more research-intensive than other types of medical care:
in 2007, prescription drugs accounted for 10% of U.S. health expenditure (Center for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (2013: Table 2)), but more than half of U.S. funding for biomedical
research came from pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms (Dorsey et al (2010)). Much of the
rest came from the federal government (i.e. the NIH), and new drugs often build on upstream
government research (Sampat and Lichtenberg (2011)). The National Cancer Institute (2015b)
says that it “has played an active role in the development of drugs for cancer treatment for 50
years… [and] that approximately one half of the chemotherapeutic drugs currently used by
7

According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, one definition of vintage is “a period of origin or manufacture (e.g.
a piano of 1845 vintage)”. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintage. Robert Solow (1960) introduced
the concept of vintage into economic analysis. Solow’s basic idea was that technical progress is “built into”
machines and other goods and that this must be taken into account when making empirical measurements of their
roles in production. This was one of the contributions to the theory of economic growth that the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences cited when it awarded Solow the 1987 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences
(Nobelprize.org (2015)).

For example, dactinomycin is used to treat C45-C49 connective and soft tissue neoplasms, C51-C58 female genital
organ neoplasms, C60-C63 male genital organ neoplasms, and C64-C68 urinary organ neoplasms.

Outpatient prescription drug claims usually don’t show the indication of the drug prescribed. Claims for drugs
administered by doctors and nurses (e.g. chemotherapy) often show the indication of the drug. In the US, 70% of
spending on anticancer drugs is for drugs covered under the medical benefit and infused or injected. However, t
data on claims for drugs administered by doctors and nurses are not available for Canada.

6
oncologists for cancer treatment were discovered and/or developed” at the National Cancer
Institute.
Second, previous research based on U.S. data indicates that non-pharmaceutical medical
innovation is not positively correlated across diseases with pharmaceutical innovation. In
Appendix 2 of Lichtenberg (2014a), it is shown that, in the U.S. during the period 1997-2007,
the rate of pharmaceutical innovation was not positively correlated across diseases with the rate
of medical procedure innovation and may have been negatively correlated with the rate of
diagnostic imaging innovation. Also, Lichtenberg (2014b) found that estimates of the effect of
pharmaceutical innovation on U.S. cancer mortality rates were insensitive to the inclusion or
exclusion of measures of non-pharmaceutical medical innovation. This suggests that failure to
control for other medical innovation is unlikely to result in overestimation of the effect of
pharmaceutical innovation on longevity growth.
In eq. (1), premature mortality from cancer at site s in year t depends on the number of
new chemical entities (drugs) to treat cancer at site s registered in Canada by the end of year t-k,
i.e. there is a lag of k years. Eq. (1) will be estimated for different values of k: k =
0,5,10,15,20,25.10 One would expect there to be a substantial lag because new drugs diffuse
gradually—they won’t be used widely until years after registration. Two kinds of evidence—
“within molecule” and “between molecule”—support the gradual diffusion hypothesis. The first
kind consists of estimates based on the y parameters from the following equation:
ln(SUmy) = m + y + my

(2)

where
SUmy = the number of standard units11 of molecule m sold in Canada y
years after registration (y = 0, 1,…, 11)
m = a fixed effect for molecule m
y = a fixed effect for age y
10

A separate model is estimated for each value of k, rather than including multiple values (CUM_NCEi,t-1,
CUM_NCEi,t-2, CUM_NCEi,t-3,…) in a single model because CUM_NCE is highly serially correlated (by
construction), which would result in extremely high multicollinearity if multiple values were included.)
11
The number of standard ‘dose’ units sold is determined by taking the number of counting units sold divided by the
standard unit factor which is the smallest common dose of a product form as defined by IMS HEALTH. For
example, for oral solid forms the standard unit factor is one tablet or capsule whereas for syrup forms the standard
unit factor is one teaspoon (5 ml) and injectable forms it is one ampoule or vial. Other measures of quantity, such as
the number of patients using the drug, prescriptions for the drug, or defined daily doses of the drug, are not
available.

7

The expression exp(y - 0) is a “relative utilization index”: it is the mean ratio of the number of
units of a molecule sold y years after registration to the number of units of the same molecule
sold in the year that it was registered. Using annual data on the number of standard units of
molecules sold in Canada during the period 1999-2010, I estimated eq. (2). Estimates of the
“relative utilization index,” based on data on 25 molecules used to treat cancer that were
registered after 1998, are shown in Figure 5. These estimates indicate that the number of units
sold 10 years after registration is about ten times as great as the number of units sold one year
after registration. Moreover, Figure 5 provides a conservative estimate of the slope of the ageutilization profile, because there was zero utilization of many of these molecules in the first few
years after they were registered.12
Figure 6 provides “between-molecule” evidence of gradual diffusion; it shows data on the
mean number of standard units of cancer drugs sold (in thousands) in Canada in 2010, by period
of registration in Canada. Mean utilization in 2010 of drugs registered after 2000 is only 15% as
high as mean utilization of drugs registered during 1991-2000, and 17% as high as mean
utilization of drugs registered during 1981-1990.
The relatively low utilization of new drugs may be due to several factors. One is that the
prices of old drugs (most of which are no longer patent-protected) are considerably lower than
the prices of new, patent-protected drugs. A second factor may be that it takes time for
physicians to become knowledgeable about new treatment options. A third potential factor is
that new drugs may be targeted at smaller patient populations. Data from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (2015) indicate that drugs approved by the FDA since 2000 were twice as
likely to include pharmacogenomic information in their labeling as drugs approved before 2000.
A fourth potential factor is that older drugs are more likely to have supplemental indications, i.e.
indications approved after the drug was initially launched, than new drugs.13
The measure of pharmaceutical innovation, CUM_NCEs,t-k = ∑d INDds REGISTEREDd,tk,

12

is based on whether drug d had an indication for cancer at site s at the end of 2011. One would

Since the dependent variable of eq. (2) is logarithmic, observations for which SU my = 0 had to be excluded.
The measure of pharmaceutical innovation, CUM_NCEs,t-k = ∑d INDds REGISTEREDd,t-k, is based on whether

drug d had an indication for cancer at site s at the end of year t-k. Data in the U.S. FDA’s Drugs@FDA data files
indicate that about one in four new molecular entities has supplemental indications, i.e. indications approved after
the drug was initially launched.

prefer to base the measure on whether drug d had an indication for cancer at site s at the end of
year t-k. FDA data indicate that about one in four new molecular entities has supplemental
indications, i.e. indications approved after the drug was initially registered.14
In eq. (1), the measure of premature mortality is the number of years of potential life lost
before age 75. This is the age threshold used in Statistics Canada's key socioeconomic database
(CANSIM). Other authorities use different age thresholds; the CDC (2013) provides estimates
of YPLL before ages 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85. To assess the robustness of my results, I will
estimate models similar to eq. (1), using age thresholds 65 and 55 as well as 75.
Chemical substances are divided into different groups according to the organ or system
on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. In the
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system developed by the World Health
Organization Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology, drugs are classified in
groups at five different levels. The highest (1st) level is the “anatomical main group” level; there
are 14 anatomical main groups. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th levels are “therapeutic subgroup,”
“pharmacological subgroup,” “chemical subgroup,” and “chemical substance,” respectively.15
Premature mortality from a disease may depend on the number of chemical (or pharmacological)
subgroups that have previously been developed to treat the disease rather than, or in addition to,
the number of chemical substances (drugs) that have previously been developed to treat the
disease. This will be investigated by estimating versions of eq. (1) in which
CUM_SUBGROUPs,t-k is included in addition to or instead of CUM_NCEs,t-k, where

Data

NCE registrations in Canada (REGISTERED). Data on new chemical entities registered in
Canada were constructed from the Health Canada Drug Product Database, which contains
product-specific information on drugs approved for use in Canada. The database is managed by
Health Canada and includes human pharmaceutical and biological drugs, veterinary drugs and
disinfectant products. It contains approximately 15,000 products which companies have notified
Health Canada as being marketed.
Drug indications (IND). Data on drug indications were obtained from Thériaque, a database of
official, regulatory, and bibliographic information on all drugs available in France, intended for
health professionals. This database is produced by the Centre National Hospitalier d'Information
sur le Médicament. In this database, drugs are coded according to WHO ATC codes, and
diseases are coded according to WHO ICD-10 codes.16 The drug indications listed in Thériaque
are labeled indications, as defined by the Collège de la Haute autorité de Santé.
Appendix Table 1 shows drugs (sorted by registration year) used to treat various types of cancer
in Canada.
Premature mortality data (YPLL75, YPLL65, YPLL55). Data on years of potential life lost
before ages 75, 65, and 55, by cancer site and year (2000-2011), were constructed from the

Empirical results
Estimates of the k parameters from eq. (1) and similar equations are shown in Table 1

and plotted (on an inverted scale) in Figure 7. Each estimate was obtained from a separate
model. All equations include a cancer incidence measure (e.g. ln(INC_RATE75st)), cancer-site
fixed effects and year fixed effects. To conserve space and simplify the presentation, estimates
of the cancer incidence coefficient () are not included in Table 1.18 None of the estimates of this
coefficient were statistically significant, and controlling for cancer incidence had very little
effect on the estimates of k. As discussed earlier, this may be due to offsetting effects of
increases in I* and increases in (I / I*) on premature mortality.
In part A of Table 1 and Figure 7, the age threshold for calculating premature mortality is
75 years, i.e. the dependent variable is years of potential life lost before age 75. In model 1, the
lag (k) from drug registrations to premature mortality equals zero, i.e. we are examining the
effect of the cumulative number of drugs registered by the end of year t on premature mortality
in year t. The estimate of 0 is not statistically significant. In model 2, the lag is 5 years; the
estimate of 5 is also statistically insignificant. In models 3-6, the lags are 10, 15, 20, and 25
years, respectively. All of these coefficients are negative and highly statistically significant (pvalue < .0001), indicating that premature mortality before age 75 is significantly inversely
related to the cumulative number of drugs registered at least 10 years earlier. The estimate of 15
is the most statistically significant, and the magnitude of the point estimate of 15 is 66% larger
than the magnitude of the point estimate of 10. Since, as discussed earlier, mean utilization of
17

Mortality data are reported in 5-year age groups in the WHO Mortality Database. I assume that deaths in a 5-year
age group occur at the midpoint of the age group. For example, I assume that deaths at age 35-39 years occurred at
age 37.5. The Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario (2015) uses this method.
18
Complete estimates of model 4 are presented in Appendix Table 2.

11
drugs that have been marketed for less than 10 years is only one-sixth as great as mean
utilization of drugs that have been marketed for at least a decade, it is not surprising that
premature mortality is strongly inversely related only to the cumulative number of drugs that had
been registered at least ten years earlier.
In parts B and C of Table 1 and Figure 7, the age thresholds for calculating premature
mortality are 65 years and 55 years, respectively. The estimates based on these age thresholds
are very similar to the estimates based on the age threshold of 75 years: premature mortality
before age 65 and 55 is strongly inversely related only to the cumulative number of drugs that
had been registered at least ten years earlier.
Figure 8 shows a bubble plot of the long-run (2000-2011) log change in YPLL before age
75 [ln(YPLL75s,2011) - ln(YPLL75s,2000)] against the long-run change in the cumulative number
of drugs registered 15 years earlier [CUM_NCEs,1996 - CUM_NCEs,1985], i.e. the number of drugs
registered during the period 1985-1996. The bubble size is proportional to the mean premature
mortality rate during 2000-2011 ((t YPLL75it) / 12). This figure confirms the finding from
model 4 in Table 1 of a highly significant inverse relationship. The point estimate of 15 from
the long-difference model (15 = -0.0247, t-value = -4.42; p-value = 0.0010) is similar to the
point estimate of 15 from model 4 in Table 1.
Figure 8 reveals that the largest number of drugs that were launched during 1985-1996
were for cancers of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue (ICD-10 block C81-C96), which
include leukemia. In principle, it is possible that excluding this ICD-10 block could have a
substantial effect on the estimates, although it does not appear from Figure 8 to be an outlier. As
shown in Appendix Table 3, when ICD-10 block C81-C96 is excluded from the sample,
estimates of eq. (1) are very similar to the estimates when it is included.
As discussed above, the hypothesis that premature mortality from a disease depends on
the number of chemical (or pharmacological) subgroups that have previously been developed to
treat the disease rather than, or in addition to, the number of chemical substances (drugs) that
have previously been developed to treat the disease can be tested by estimating versions of eq.
(1) in which CUM_SUBGROUPs,t-k is included instead of, or in addition to, CUM_NCEs,t-k.
Table 2 provides estimates of models suitable for testing this hypothesis. Estimates from three
different models are presented there. In all three models, the dependent variable is ln(YPLL75st)
and k = 15. The first model shown is the same as model 4 in Table 1, in which the only

12
pharmaceutical variable is CUM_NCEs,t-15. In the second model (model 19), CUM_NCEs,t-15 is
replaced by CUM_SUBGROUPs,t-15. The coefficient on this variable is negative and significant,
but it is less significant than the coefficient on CUM_NCEs,t-15 in model 4. The third model
(model 20) includes both CUM_NCEs,t-15 and CUM_SUBGROUPs,t-15. Controlling for the
cumulative number of drugs, the cumulative number of chemical subgroups is not statistically
significant. These estimates suggest that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class
(chemical subgroup) are not “therapeutically equivalent,”19 i.e. they do not have essentially the
same effect in the treatment of a disease or condition.

Discussion
During the period 2000-2011, the premature (before age 75) cancer mortality rate (the

number of years of potential life lost due to cancer before age 75 per 100,000 population age 074) declined by about 9%. The estimates of model 4 imply that, in the absence of
pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996, the premature cancer mortality rate
would have increased about 12% during the period 2000-2011.20, 21 As shown in Figure 9, the
premature mortality rate would have been 1788, rather than its actual value of 1459. In 2011, the
population age 0-74 was about 32.1 million (or 321 hundred thousand), so the estimates of model
4 imply that pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996 reduced the number of
years of potential life lost to cancer before age 75 in 2011 by 105,366 (= 321 * (1788 – 1459) ).
This reduction in premature mortality is an estimate of the benefit to Canadians below
age 75 in 2011 of pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996. Now I will calculate
an estimate of the (social) cost of this innovation. As shown in Appendix Table 1, 40 drugs that
are used to treat cancer were registered during the period 1985-1996. Data from IMS Health
indicate that in 2010,22 expenditure on products containing these molecules was 409 million
19

According to one medical dictionary, drugs that have “essentially the same effect in the treatment of a disease or
condition” are therapeutically equivalent. Drugs that are therapeutically equivalent may or may not be chemically
equivalent, bioequivalent, or generically equivalent. http://medicaldictionary.thefreedictionary.com/therapeutic+equivalent
20
In Appendix Table 2, the point estimate of 2000 is -0.1157 (p-value = 0.0003). If CUM_NCEs,t-15 is excluded from
the equation, the point estimate of 2000 is 0.0873 (p-value = 0.0008).
21
An important possible reason why the premature cancer mortality rate would have increased in the absence of
previous pharmaceutical innovation is a substantial decline in the “competing risk” of death from cardiovascular
disease. See Honoré and Lleras-Muney (2006).
22
2010 is the most recent year for which these data are available.

13
USD, which is about 1.9% of total Canadian drug expenditure (21.6 billion USD).

About 70%

of cancer patients were diagnosed before the age of 75, so it seems reasonable to assume that 288
million USD (= 70% * 409 million USD) was spent on these drugs for cancer patients below the
age of 75.23 This implies that the cost per life-year before age 75 gained from previous
pharmaceutical innovation was 2730 USD (= 288 million USD / 105,366 life-years).
Presumably most of the drugs registered during the period 1985-1996 were off-patent by
2010, so these cost estimates reflect prices of generic drugs. Law (2013) argues that Canadian
generic drug prices have traditionally been set using a percentage of the equivalent brand-name
price as a ceiling, and that typically, these percentages ranged between 60% and 70% of the
brand price.24 This suggests that if these drugs had been sold at branded rather than generic
prices, the cost per life-year gained would have been between 3900 (= 2730 / 60%) and 4550 (=
2730 / 70%) USD. However, the ratio of generic price to branded price may be significantly
lower for cancer drugs (which are often infused or injected) than it is for other drugs (which are
primarily administered orally). For example, when imatinib, which is used to treat a set of
leukemias, went generic in Canada in 2013, the generic drug price was approximately 25% of the
branded price. If the generic/branded price ratio were 25%, and if these drugs had been sold at
branded rather than generic prices, the cost per life-year gained would have been 10,920 (= 2730
/ 25%) USD.
Hirth et al (2000) performed a search of the value-of-life literature and identified 41
estimates of the value of life from 37 articles.25 From estimates of the value of life, they
calculated estimates of the value (in 1997 dollars) of a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).26
Four types of methods were used to produce those estimates: revealed preference/job risk,
contingent valuation, revealed preference/non-occupational safety, and human capital. Median
implied values (in 1997 and 2011 dollars27) of a QALY estimated in those studies are shown in
the following table.

23

Since some of these drugs are used to treat diseases other than cancer, this is probably an overestimate.
Law (2013) also argues that recent changes have moved these price ceilings lower in almost every province, to a
nationwide low of 25% in Ontario.
25
Twenty-eight of the reviewed articles used U.S. data; the remaining articles used data from the U.K. (4), Canada
(3), France (1), and Denmark (1). National origin did not significantly affect the values.
26
Lichtenberg (2009) demonstrated that, although the health of cancer patients is less than perfect, the number of
QALYs gained from pharmaceutical innovation could be either greater than or less than the number of life-years
gained.
27
The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased by 40% between 1997 and 2011.

My estimate of the cost per life-year before age 75 gained from previous pharmaceutical
innovation is well below even the lowest estimates of the value of a life-year saved.

Summary and conclusions
The premature cancer mortality rate has been declining in Canada, and there has been

considerable variation in the rate of decline across cancer sites. I analyzed the effect that
pharmaceutical innovation has had on premature cancer mortality in Canada during the period
2000-2011, by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical
innovation had larger declines in the premature mortality rate, controlling for changes in the
incidence rate.
The study is subject to several limitations. First, the measures of pharmaceutical
innovation that were used were based only on labeled indications, but the National Cancer
Institute (2015d) says that “off-label use of drugs is very common in cancer treatment.” Second,
it was not possible to measure or control for non-pharmaceutical medical innovation. Third, the
outcome measures used were life-years gained, not quality-adjusted life-years gained.
The estimates indicated that premature mortality before age 75 is significantly inversely
related to the cumulative number of drugs registered at least 10 years earlier. Since mean
utilization of drugs that have been marketed for less than 10 years is only one-sixth as great as
mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for at least a decade, it is not surprising that
premature mortality is strongly inversely related only to the cumulative number of drugs that had
been registered at least ten years earlier. Premature mortality before age 65 and 55 is also
strongly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs that had been registered at least ten

15
years earlier. None of the estimates of the effect of incidence on mortality were statistically
significant.
Controlling for the cumulative number of drugs, the cumulative number of chemical
subgroups does not have a statistically significant effect on premature mortality. This suggests
that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class (chemical subgroup) are not
therapeutically equivalent.
During the period 2000-2011, the premature (before age 75) cancer mortality rate
declined by about 9%. The estimates imply that, in the absence of pharmaceutical innovation
during the period 1985-1996, the premature cancer mortality rate would have increased about
12% during the period 2000-2011. A substantial decline in the “competing risk” of death from
cardiovascular disease could account for this. The estimates imply that pharmaceutical
innovation during the period 1985-1996 reduced the number of years of potential life lost to
cancer before age 75 in 2011 by 105,366.
The cost per life-year before age 75 gained from previous pharmaceutical innovation is
estimated to have been 2730 USD. Most of the previously-registered drugs were off-patent by
2011, but evidence suggests that, even if these drugs had been sold at branded rather than generic
prices, the cost per life-year gained would have been below 11,000 USD, a figure well below
even the lowest estimates of the value of a life-year gained.

Years after registration in Canada

The relative utilization index is the mean ratio of the number of units of a molecule sold y years after registration to the number of units of
the same molecule sold in the year that it was registered. These estimates are based on data on 25 molecules used to treat cancer that were
registered after 1998. The figure provides a conservative estimate of the slope of the age‐utilization profile, because there was zero
utilization of many of these molecules in the first few years after they were registered.
