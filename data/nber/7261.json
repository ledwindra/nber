It shows, in the context of a simple model of optimizing private-sector behavior, that such inertial policy can be optimal.  The reason is that small but persistent changes in short-term interest rates in response to shocks allow a larger effect of monetary policy on long rates and hence upon aggregate demand, for a given degree of overall interest-rate variability. The paper also considers two ways of achieving the desirable degree of inertia in the equilibrium responses to shocks.  One is by assignment of a loss function that penalizes squared interest-rate changes (despite the fact that interest-rate changes do not affect the true social objective) to a central bank that is then expected to use discretion in the pursuit of the goal.  The second is through commitment to an explicit instrument rule, a generalization of the  Taylor rule' in which the funds rate is an increasing function of the lagged funds rate, as in estimated Fed reaction functions.\n\n",
