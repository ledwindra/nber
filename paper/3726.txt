           WAS THE GREAT DEPRESSION A LOW-LEVEL EQUILIBRIUM?

                               ABSACT
    Was the Great Depression the outcome of a massive
coordination failure? Or was it a unique equilibrium response to
adverse shocks? More generally, do aggregates fluctuate partly
because agents occasionally settle on inferior, low-level
equilibria? These questions lie at the heart of the current
disagreement over how one should view business cycles. This
paper estimates an employment model with monetary and real
shocks. In one region of the parameter-space the model yields
uniqueness, while in the other it yields up to three equilibria.
When more than one equilibrium exists, a selection rule is
needed. The equilibrium selection rule that we use has a
Markovian structure, but the money supply is denied a
coordination role --    it
                        can not affect the choice of the
equilibrium point. The global maximum likelihood estimates lie
in the uniqueness region, implying that instead of being a
low-level, coordination-failure equilibrium, the Depression era
was caused by movements in fundamentals only. This result held
for each of the three subperiods (since 1900) for which the
estimation was done, but the estimates are imprecise and the
conclusions that we draw from them are tentative. The paper also
computes the local maxima in the region of multiplicity, and here
some of our estimates indicate that the years 1932 and 1933 would
have exhibited low level equilibria had more than one equilibrium
existed.

        Was the Great Depression the outcome of a massive coordination failure?

Ot was it a unique equilibrium response to adverse shocks? More generally, do

aggtegates fluctuate pattly because agents occasionally settle on inferior, low-

level equilibria? These questions lie at the heart of the current disagreement

over how one should view business cycles. This paper proposes a methodology

within which such quesrions can be addressed.

        In the real business cycle model (Prescott 1986) aggregates fluctuate

because unique equilibrium points are displaced by shocks to technology. These

shocks are intrinsic because they affect production possibilities. When money

also affects trading possibilities (Lucas 1972) then a change in the supply of

money too is an intrinsic shock that causes aggregate fluctuations.'

        The real and the monetary approaches to fluctuations have both met with

skepticism. Many reject the real business-cycle assumption that reductions in

output are caused by technological regress (Greenwald and Stiglitz ,   1988).   And,

money does not seem to lead the cycle (Kydland and Prescott, 1990), or explain

much of the output variation (Sims 1980).2           The emerging literature on

coordination failures, summarized recently by Howitt (1990), takes a different

view.     It seeks to explain at least some aggregate fluctuations by means of

exttinsic shocks, shocks that act to select one of several equilibrium outcomes.

While the equilibrium point need not be chosen by an extrinsic random device -     -
the   choice could reflect the realization of some observed or unobserved intrinsic

shock - -   models with multiple equilibria can clearly generate more volatility

because aside from any intrinsic shocks that they may contain, they can also


       In Lucas's model equilibrium is unique within the class of equilibtia that
he considers, although there may be others that he does not consider that are
more complicated functions of the histoty.

direction (Todd, 1990).
include a random mechanism that causes jumps among equilibria.

         Some analyses of aggregates allow for random jumps among regimes (e.g

Hamilton 1989) but few build an equilibrium model of the economy that generates

regimes endogenously as branches of its equilibrium correspondence.3 This is

what we shall do here. We shall ask whether aggregate labor market fluctuations

reflect, in part, jumps among three Pareto-ranked equilibria.      The jumps are

driven by an extrinsic Markov process.       The model has two real shocks and a

monetary shock.      Par some parameter values equilibrium is unique, while for

others there are three equilibria.          Surprisingly, the maximum likelihood

estimates lie in the uniqueness region. This is surprising because the multiple

equilibrium subset of the pmrameter space has more parameters: besides the

structural parameters, there also are the parameters of the equilibrium choice

mechanism. The selection parameters are estimated jointly with the structural

parameters, in the spirit of Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956), and they were estimated

separately for three different periods. In each case they were located in the

uniqueness region.     Even the 1920-1940 period, chosen especially because it

contained the Great Depression -- a period that many think was a separate regime,

a breed apart from the rest --   yielded   the same result.4

         Out aim here is to answer a specific question. In proceeding, we shall

ignore some potentially useful information (such as data on wages) that, for

technical reasons, we could not deal with. We shall ignore the possibility that

the money supply was endogenous. All this limits the value of this paper as an



       Exceptions are Butler and Michell (1989), and Manning (1989), although
they proceed quite differently from us.
     A
       The Great Depression was anomalous not only in its severity but also in
its character. Pot instance, Table 12 of Greenwald and Stiglitz (1988) shows
that in Germany, Australia, the Hetherlands, the U.K. and the U.S., real wages
were higher at the trough of the depression in 1932 than had been at its outset
in 1929.
investigation into the causes of the Great Depression. The paper's contribution

is therefore largely methodological: Questions such ss the one we ask are likely

to come up sgain and again, and the way that one goes about answering them will

probably have to resemble what we do here.
1. Detecting Multiplicity.

        What dynamic behavior, in general, would one look for to see if the date

are driven by jumps among distinct equilibria? This question can he answered

only with e specific model, end even there we now have examples in which one can

net identify the presence of extrinsic uncertainty (Hamilton end Whiteman, 1985)

One must therefore restrict the way that intrinsic and extrinsic data affect

observables so as to get identification in the sense of eq. (2) of Jovanovic

(1989) --   without   rbis, even an infinite sample will not contain the answer we

seek.

        Deterministic models with multiple solutions suggest that data should

cluster around distinct equilibrium points.5 Methods for finding the number of

distinct clusters have been extensively discussed in the statistical literature

(Fukunaga 1972). Here we shall add structure to the problem, structure of the

kind commonly found in economic models. Let y be an endogenous observable, x an

exogenous observable, and c an exogenous jobservable. The pair (x, c) is then

an aggregate shock. Modifying Cooper's (1987) exposition slightly, let U(y, y'

x, c) be the representative agent's payoff funttion in the state (x, c) when he

takes a decision y, and when all others take the decision y'.             Let U be

continuously differentiable and concave in y, and let f(y', x, c) be the optimal

action for the agent at hand. Assuming that the maximum is interior, we must

have




(1)           f(y,y',x, €) = 0       at y =   f(y',x, e)
               8y




        Unless, of course, there is a continuum of equilibria.
The set of symmetric Nash equilibria for the game indexed by (x, c) is

      6 It is hard to derive any observable implications in a general model with
multiple equilibria. This was shown by Jovanovic (1989). One must make stron
assumptions about the selection rule in particular, as Goldfeld and Quandt (1972
and Quandt (1972) pointed out some time ago. Also, see Kiefer (1978), Lee and
Porter (1984), Coslett and Lee (1985) and Hamilton (1989). Lemma 1 of Jovanovic
 (1987) shows that for any f, a payoff function can be found that generates it as
the optimal reaction function. The payoff function
U(y, y' , x, c) —          yf(y',
                          x, c) - y2/2 is one (among many) that does the job.
Obviously, any monotone transform of U would work too.

                                                       5
For some (x, c) pairs there will be three equilibria such as A, B, C, and for

others there will be just one, such as D. The term x+c shifts f up by the same

amount for all y.7 With these assumptions about f,

The equilibrium correspondence is therefore the set of solutions to a cubic

equation in y. it is drawn in Figure 2.

For x+ a (0, .0625) there are three equilibria. At x+ — 0 and x+e — .0625




       Many models have exactly three equilibria such as A, B, and C.    This
example will motivate the Phillips curve model that we shall estimate, and it
will bring out some observable implications of multiplicity that should apply
more generally.

                                            6
there are exactly two, and everywhere else, equilibrium is unique. Now let's

assume an equilibrium selection device that assigns equal probability to each

branch of the equilibrium correspondence, conditional, of course, on x+c. So,

for instance, when x+C E   (0,   0625), each equilibrium branch gets a probability

of 1/3.   Let us also take c to be distributed normally with mean zero and

variance a.

      One way to summarize this model's implications is to look at the

expectation of y conditional on x, E(yx) and its conditional variance V(yx)

In doing so, we shall ask how fast information is lost as a grows. The upcoming

figures are based on a simulation that, for each value of x, drev 500 c's and

computed g(yx) and V(yx) .         Those C's for which     x+c C [0,   .06251 also

necessitated an equiprobable assignment to the 3 branches.

      For a —   .001 the real side of the model is essentially deterministic, and

all randomness stems from the selection device. That is why in Figure 3,V(yx)


is positive only for x a [0, .0625], and why E(yx) jumps as x crosses the

boundary of the region of multiplicity.

      Figure 4 shows that these features of the data should remain visible as        -




long as a is an order of magnitude less than the range of the region of
multiplicity. However, Figure 5 shows that as a gets to be of roughly the same

order as the magnitude of the region of multiplicity, the discontinuous-like

behavior of both E(yx) and V(yjx) disappears, although one can still see

tremendous heteroskedasticity in y as x varies. Finally, as we increase a even

more, E(yx) becomes quite smooth, but the heteroskedasticity remains. This is


shown in Figure 6. This example indicates that V(yx) is a batter indicator of

multiplicity than E(yx) if we expect a fair amount of noise. Indeed, this is

what one would expect generally: If multiple equilibria arise in some region of

x-space then switching among equilibria will create additional variance in y when

x enters the region in question.

      Why does this class of models exhibit multiplicity for intermediate values

of x+c, and not at the extremely high and low values of x+f? The reason is that

for tail values of x+c, playing high or playing low is a dominant strategy for

a fraction of the population that is large enough to rule out multiplicity.
2. A Macroeconomic Model of Employment.

      We shall estimate a model of employment with monetary shocks as well as

real demand and supply shocks that has three equilibria for some parameter

values. The only exogenous observable will be the money supply, or rather its

surprise.

      Agents differ in their fixed costs of employment c. Agent c takes

action mc    (0,1). If mc — 1 he works, while if s —      0   he stays home, The

expected payoff to working is #(,x,u), where x is the monetary surprise, u

a shock to aggregate demand or productivity, and a the fraction of agents that

work. The net payoff to agent c is




            f(xu) - c        if a = 1,    end

                  0          ifac=0.


Being of measure zero, each agent takes a as given. And if his c is less

than (a,x,u), he will play a — 1.    Let v be an aggregate shock to the supply

of labor and let F( v) be the distribution of c. Then m Nash equilibrium is

en employment rate y for which



(3)         y —   F[(y,x,u);v].

The model is static.8 Its dynamics stem entirely from shocks to the supply of



     6 And it is much like Diamond's (1982) coconut example. Let coconuts grow
on trees that cost c utils to climb, let F be the distribution of costs over
trees, end let esch person see one tree per period. Eating s coconut yields one
util, while hunger yields zero utils. Eating one's own coconut is taboo, snd the
probability of meeting a trading partner is .     The number of people climbing
trees is "employment", and equilibrium employment solves (6).

money, and from shocks to the demand and the supply of labor.9

      We now get specific about F and .       Let   F(c;v) — 11(1 +   vc8)   for c   0,


where fi   > 0.   An increase in v shifts the disttibution of costs to the right,

and therefore dampens the supply of labor.

      We shall parametrize      in such a way that two regimes will arise. In one

regime, "regime U", equilibrium will be unique for all values of the exogenous

data. In the other, "regime M", there will be three equilibria, for at least

some values of the exogenous data.        Equilibrium employment, y, is at rhe

intersections with the 45" line in Figure 7, and for some parameter values there

will be three such intersections.10

      If     were defined to be the real wage, this model would find it hard to

ascribe low-level equilibrium status to the Great Depression, because the early

years of the depression saw a rise in the real wage. Since equilibria are on the

45° line in Figure 7, and since F is increasing, this implies that employment and



       An infinite number of (, F) pairs can produce the same composition FØ).
Roger Klein has pointed out to us that this identification problem also shows up
in discrete choice models; see Manski (1987). The problem can be solved if one
has information on or F separately. For instance if one assumed that        is the
marginal product of labor and hence under price-taking also equal to the wage,
then one could use wage-data to identify        and F separately.     But    could
incorporate queuing considerations, or synergies between market and non-market
returns, or even lifetime returns that current wages do not capture. This, as
well as the added complexity that a second endogenous variable would bring to the
empirical work, led us to confine our analysis to just one endogenous variable
 (employment). On the other hand, Cogan (1981) estimates the mean of F at around
1,000 1966 dollars, although his estimate is for direct costs only, and excludes
utility gained from nonmarket activities.

        For regime M to arise one must have a region in which  increases rapidly
enough with y. This could be because of trading externalities (Diamond 1982,
Hall 1989), pecuniary externalities (Shleifer 1986, Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny
1989), or technological externalities (Lucas 1988, Romer 1987).       Increasing
returns could also arise even in the short run if unused capacity varies with
employment, as would happen if the short-run elasticity of substitution between
capital and labor were close to zero. Papers that find increasing returns at the
aggregate level at high frequencies include Caballero and Lyons (1990), Kienow
 (1990), and Walters (1963). To ensure that the curves in figure 7 start above
the 45 line and end up below it, we need (0,x,u) >0 and (l,x,u) < w for all
x and u.

wages would have to be positively related." In other words, equating               to the

real wage would make the Great Depression as big an outlier here as it is in

models with unique equilibria.

      Let z —   log[y/(l-y)],     so that'2 y —       l/(1+e).   Substituting for F and

y in eq. (3) and inverting both aides yields

       Which in developed countries they are, according to Table 7 of Greenwald

                                             ,        is a monotone increasing
transform of y. In the estimation, we take y1 to be the employment/population
ratio. Having obtained z in this way, we then linearly de-trend it. Employment,
not hours, seems the appropriate messure for y since we vary only the extensive
margin in this model.     Kydland and Prescott (1989) have recently modelled
employment variations in both the extensive and intensive margins. As for x,,
it is the surprise in the logarithm of the U.S. money-supply (Ml) in period t,
when it is regressed on its own lag, and lagged z.      Exogeneity of x, is, of
course, doubtful, especially at yearly frequencies; we shall nevertheless assume
it here.

Now if the two curves in figure 7 are to start above the 450 line and are to end

up below it, z -      log must go to infinity as z -.                 ., and to   minus infinity as


z -.    _o• Since       3 is the dominant term on the right-hand side of (5), this

means that a3 must be positive.

         Substituting in (5) and dividing by a3 leads to:

             The restriction that this places on (y) is, of course, that (y)
approximate a cubic in the variable log]y/(l-y)], so that must be translog in
form.
      We chose the cubic approximation for several reasons. First, it delivers
the familiar S-shape under regime $ in Figure 7.   Second, a quadratic leads to
the problem of nonexistence of equilibrium for some values of x, u and v. And
third, a polynomial of order higher than 3 would need to be of an order of at
least S (for reasons having to do with corner conditions, reasons that we shall
elaborate on below), and with our short time series that number of parameters
could not be precisely estimated.

     14 Loosely speaking, if is some multiple of the marginal product of labor,
this marginal product must go to infinity as y • 0, and it must go to zero as
y -'   1.

if we believe thst & > 0 then at any locally stable equilibrium, we expect to

find that c C 0.                   This point will resurface when we look at the empirical

results.

           Let   us   pause here and go over what we have done,                           With the specific

functional forms, the transformation from y to z, and the cubic approximation

for , wa have transformed our structural equation (3) into the manageable form

(6). The ideal procedure is to estimate this implicit function directly rather

than solve it for the reduced form correspondence, because one would not then

have to assume anything about how the solutions to (6) are chosen. Unfortunately

the maximum likelihood method will not do for this purpose because when (6) has

multiple roots, the value of the Jacobian of the transformation from e to z

will generally vary over the solutions to (6).                                   So we used an instrumental

variable method instead, but as the results were rather poor we shall discuss

them only at the end,

a rightward shift of supply, or both. As in the real business cycle model

When A < 0, the equilibrium correspondence is still S-shaped, but it is now

single-valued.

a 3 X 3 Markov chain. This Markov chain describes the link between equilibrium

choices in consecutive periods.

      But whet if c -     clogx was not in (r1, r2) in the previous period, and
enters it this period? Here, we assume that the probability that a branch is

chosen is the steady state probability for that branch for the Matkov chain

described above. This is natural if one believes that the selection process has

memory during consecutive periods in (r1, r2), but not if the spell in (r1, r2)

is interrupted. Moreover, this assumption introduces no new parameters. All in

all, the selection mechanism introduces three new parameters.

      The selection mechanism can capture a variety of plausible hypotheses about

how equilibria ate chosen.      For instance, if   ,r2 —   0, the "naively" unstable
branch 2 will never materialize.15 And if           —   1, the economy will always
settle on the high activity equilibrium. Under some added assumptions, this

equilibrium is the one at which welfare is also at its highest, although further

Pareto improvements could occur if employment were raised even further so long

as this could be done without distorting a margin other than the one bearing on

the participation decision.

      Let d   (d1, d2, d3, d4). Then d determines what branch of the equilibrium

correspondence a particular z1 lies on. Let Y(z1, z, d) —         I   if z jumps from

branch i at t-l, to branch j at t, and let it be zero otherwise. Similarly, let

Y(z1, z, d) —    1   if z jumps to branch j at t from somewhere outside the region

of multiplicity at t-l, and let it be zero otherwise. Then we shall assume that




        While we would prefer not to even mention out of equilibrium dynamics,
one can hypothesize something similar to the familiar tatonnemenc process in
Walrasian equilibrium. The middle solution is unstable in the sense that if "by
mistake" employment were, say, a bit larger than the equilibrium value, even more
people would wish to enter the market, and if it were a bit smaller, even more
would wish to withdraw.

The 3 new parameters are it1, it2 and the parameter b, which is an index of serial

dependence in the selection mechanism. When b —      0    no transitions occur (perfect

autocorrelation). When b —      1   the selection is i.i.d. ,       with   probabilities it1,

it2 and it3.'6 One can thus think of p and 1-b as parameters that compete in

explaining the persistence that the z exhibit.                  The first measures the

persistence stemming from the real side, the second measures the persistence

arising from the selection side.

The functional forms of (9) and (10) prevent us from calculating the ML estimate

of the or explicitly.                         A standard approach would then use the first order

conditions along with an iteration procedure. However, we use a less costly

alternative based on an algorithm that maximizes (13) over a large finite set of

parameter values. This set is a discretized approximation of the parameter space


                                                                     18
generated by it1,   it2 and   b. The third and final stage maximizes the likelihood

over d. A more detailed description of the procedure is in the Appendix.



Identification. When A C       0,   this problem is standard and the selection rule in

eq. (9) and eq. (10) does not come into play.               But when a1 and a2 imply a
positive A, they determine the d1 and hence the               and Y uniquely, and this
identifies b and the icj.     The likelihood function is otherwise standard, and its

remaining parameters clearly are identified.



Estimates. We computed maximum likelihood estimates using annual data on

employment and the money-supply for three separate time periods: 1901-1940,

1921-1940 and 1951-1986. Surprisingly, uniqueness does better than multiplicity

in each case --        is highest when A <    0.     We also computed the local maximum,

in each period, over the region for which A > 0.                 These local maxima are

reported in the first column of each table. A curious and unexpected property

of the estimates for the general case is that when A is in the region where the

structure is afforded the "luxury" of assigning observations into one of rhree

separate regimes, it chooses to assign all of the observations to the second,

middle branch. This is all the more puzzling because this branch is unstable.

      Surprise money does well in explaining the movements in employment. For

instance, employment reductions during the Great Depression coincide with periods

in which surprise money was negative.             This seeming ability of the exogenous

regressor to "explain" what would otherwise appear as shifts in regime might

preclude the structures with multiplicity from doing better. For this reason,




                                             19
columns 4 and S of each table report estimates that constrain c to be zero.17

      Following that, we constrain p to be zero. Under this constraint, any

persistence that z exhibits is explainable only by persistence in the way

equilibria are chosen. These estimates too should favor multiplicity.      FThafly,


we report estimates that set p and c both equal to zero. This case should favor

multiple equilibria the most.

      Turning to table 1, we find that the estimates that the first column

reports do not maximize the likelihood. Moreover, at the local maximum in the

A > 0 region, a2 — 1 -- the selection rule always chooses the middle, unstable

branchl Because of this, c is estimated to be positive, implying that 6 is

negative, so that surprise money reduces    I This rather strange estimate comes

about because the raw correlation between z and x is positive (causing a highly

significant and positive OLS coefficient reported at the foot of the table), and

the only way to get the model to mimic this at an unstable equilibrium is if c

is in fact positive. This is clear from figure 8.       The estimate of b — 1 is

meaningless: It says that equilibrium selection is iid, but this is because

selection is driven by a degenerate random variable, so that b is not identified.

      The ML estimate is in column 2. It lies in the uniqueness region, and the

equilibrium is stable, which is reflected in a negative estimate of c. Figure

9a plots the estimated equilibrium correspondence at the median c, as a function

of x. This is the curve ML. The curve ML is based on the first column of the

table. Figure Pa also depicts the linear OLS regression line.        The figure is

deceptive in one respect: At first glance it would seem that a cubic could do


     17        present these estimates to help us understand the estimation
          We
techniques, and not because we expected the restrictions c — 0 to be valid;
clearly, it isn't because it denies any relation between x and z, and yet the
data show a significant and positive correlation between the two in each
subperiod.

better then ML in that it could get closer to same of the points if it had more

curvature. While this is true at c — 0, it would not maximize the likelihood

because bounces around.19

      The ML estimate remains in the uniqueness region even if we force p or c

to be zero one at a time. Only when kQh        of   them are set to zero does the ML

estimate choose the parameters from the region of multiplicity. A graphical

representation in z -   logx   space is not helpful when c —   0   because z and x are

then unrelated. But the case where p — 0 is of some interest: When p —          0,   the

selection rule now assigns positive weight to the bottom branch of the

equilibrium correspondence, although most of the weight still goes on the middle

branch. Just two out of the forty z5's are put on the bottom branch of the

equilibrium correspondence.       The years were 1932 and 1933.         The estimated

equilibrium correspondence is plotted in figure 9b.

      According to these estimates, the autocorrelation in the choice of

equilibria, as measured by 1-b is high: The probability of remaining on branch

i from one period to the next is 1-b+b2r8. The last two sets of estimates in

table 1 put this probability at about .97 for branch 2, and at about .7 for

branch 1. We had originally conjectured that such parameter values would be part

of the unconstrained ML estimate, but this was not the case.19



     18 The stationary distribution of c has variance a25/(l-p2) which, according
to the estimates in column 2, means that the standard deviation of c is about
.03. On the other hand, the estimates of a implied by the first column are
three times as high. According to figure 8 this estimate must be divided by c
to correct it into units of x. Using estimates of (p a ) from either column
gives us a standard deviation of roughly unity for the ef6ct of unobservables
in units of x.

      19 Bernanke (1983, esp. Table 2) observes that his linear Phillips curve-
type model leaves much of the depression-era variability in output unexplained.
His response is to add variables measuring bank failures and liabilities of firms
on the right hand side of his regressions, but the endogeneity of these variables
makes those regressions hard to interpret.      Our approach is to instead add
nonlinearity to the underlying relationship between employment and surprise
money.

      The next set of results deal with the 1921-40 period, and they are reported

in table 2. We had expected structures with non-uniqueness to do especially well

here. That they do not in the general case reflects surprise money's ability to

track employment fairly closely in this subperiod. But as soon as either p or

c are constrained at zero, multiple equilibrium is the ML choice. But the middle

branch still gets all the weight (s —      1).   Paradoxically, this middle branch of

the ML curve slopes in the opposite direction of the ML and the OLS line (see

figure 10), which is no doubt caused by the large sampling error in the estimated

coefficients.       The estimate of b is meaningless here because there are no

transitions among the three branches, and so b plays no role.2° Figure 10 plots




     20 In eq. (13), when r2 —   1,   the expression bird   +   I{j_j)(l-b) does not depend
on b when j — 2.      When j # 2, Y is itself zero, so again the likelihood does
not depend on b.

ML and ML (for the general case) along with the linear OLS regression line.

               Table 3 reports results for the l951-g6 period, results that we

anticipated would not show evidence of multiplicity because this set of bivariate

data seem to contain no outliers, no distinct clusters. As the table shows,

uniqueness does better than multiplicity no matter what restrictions one imposes.

Incidentally, the OLS regressions show that the Phillips curve relation was

weaker in this period than prior to World War II.

      On the whole, then, employment fluctuations since 1900 are better accounted

fot by a structure that exhibits uniqueness of equilibrium at all times, a

structure that ascribes all fluctuations to movements in fundamentals. Rut this

conclusion is tenuous because A does not differ significantly from zero. Its

ML estimates are -0.023, -0.009, and -0.023 for the three subperiods. Given the

standard errors for a1 and a2, these estimates of A do not differ significantly

from zero.




The Instrumental Variables Approach. When estimating models that have multiple

solutions, the instrumental variables approach is appealing because it requires

neither an explicit solution for the endogenous variable (See Ainmmiya (1973)),

nor any assumption about the way in which solutions are chosen. That is, the

assumptions we make in equations (9) and (10) are unnecessary with this approach,

which works directly on the implicit function defining the equilibrium point,

which in this case is in eq. (6).

      We used the approach as described in Judge et al (1985), p. 168, to

estimate the reduced form equation (6) for the special case where c —        0:21


     27.
           A more advanced treatment of these issues is in Gallant (1977).

(6)'              z=—aQ—a2zL-alz—cL

We used x and x2 as instruments for z and z2,respectively, in eq. (6)' while

treating z3 as the dependent variable.                             Since we use XL as one of the

instruments, we can not include it as an additional regressor in (6)' since its

coefficient, c        ,
                          would not be identified.

            The results are in Table 4. They show that the approach works poorly here.

The estimates are quite imprecise; in most cases their absolute values are less

than the standard error. The reason for this is of course that x and x2 are

poot instruments for CL and Z2L so that this procedure also offers no firm

conclusion about the sign of A.

3. Conclusion.

            In spite of the extra parameters that the multiple equilibrium structures

introduce, namely it7,        or,   and b, they fit about the same or a little worse than

structures with unique equilibria.                        The exercise does not, however, treat

multiplicity in the most charitable way because the mechanism that chooses

equilibria does not depend on x. An S-shaped curve passing through the points

in figures 10, 11 and 12 will explain much more if x is allowed to determine



                                                          27
which of threo branches gets chosen at date t.     This will be the case if the

Fed's actions serve a coordination role end act to signal which equilibrium gets

chosen. But how does one operationalize such a concept? If the selection rule's

dopondence on XL is arbitrary, this introduces as many parameters as thero are

time periods, and with just two time-series on observablos, the loss of degrees

of freedom is too large. Moreover, section 58 of Jovanovic (1989) shows that

unless one has prior information on just how exactly an exogenous observable

affects the selection mechanism, one is, in this bivariate context at least,

likely to fall prey to using a model that is consistent with (or, rather, can not

be refuted by) just about any correlation pattern one might see. The natural

procedure would use a parsimonious representation of the m1 and b as a function

of x or x or other exogenous obaervables.

In the regime with three equilibria we must take into account the likelihood

of the selection of equilibria. Let                              be the probability of switching from

branch i to branch j from one year to another, i, j —                                   1, 2, 3. Similarly let
  be the probability of selecting branch j, j —                                1, 2, 3, given a unique
equilibrium in the previous yemr.

easily verified that (it3)             are    the steady state probabilities of this Markov

chain.

                                 t—s i—i j.1




Note that L2 is a conditional likelihood given the selection in period one.

        The likelihood function in the general case thus has the form


                                           L =



which   implies (11) of the text.

        Consider next the parameters d defined on page 10 (1>0) .       The

definition of d, i — 1, 2, 3, 4, yields



                                     d2 =       (3d1d)/4,

                              a1 = -3(d1+d4)/2




This means that the parameters d1 and d4 determine the regimes as well as the

coefficients a1 and a2. Moreover, if an observation z lies within (d1, d2)

then the lower branch is selected whereas the middle branch is selected if z

6 (d2, d3), etc..

where   d     and d3,,,, are given by (Al) with d1 and dA replaced by dim and d4m.

Since   the   sample size is T the total number of partitions of the sample is

T(T-l)/2. For a given partition a and a2 are given and the remaining

parameters are to be determined by maximizing (12) and (13) .        Let   the

likelihood function that corresponds to these estimates conditional on P be

denoted by i,. The ML estimates are those which maximize I with respect to

(a, n).

        Mote that the standard errors reported above are only computed for ihe

case with a unique equilibrium. To obtain the corresponding estimates in the

case with multiple equilibria is possible through bootstrap simulation

procedures, but we leave this for future work.
