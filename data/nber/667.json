    "abstract": "\n\nThe paper analyzes the joint determination of wives' earnings and labor force participation over the life cycle given the interruptions in wives' work careers. The interruptions affect the profitability of the investment in human capital, which in turn determines earnings. The earnings prospects feed back into the participation decision, namely, the decision whether and for how long to drop out of the labor force. The formal analysis compares the age-earnings profiles of persons who drop out of the labor force with those who do not during the pre- and post-interruption period. The comparison is carried out where interruptions are assumed to be exogenous and when they are endogenous. The effect of productivity at home, the initial stock of human capital and its rental value on the length of the interruption is investigated.\n\n",
