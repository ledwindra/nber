Do the Cognitive Skills of School Dropouts Matter in the Labor Market?

1. Introduction

Between 1979 and 1996 the median earnings of 25-34 year-old males who left school before
obtaining a high school diploma fell by 30 percent; the corresponding figure for female dropouts is
a 21 percent decline. Over this same period the earnings premium four-year college graduates
received over the earnings of male dropouts increased from 60 percent to 133 percent. The
primary explanation for these patterns is that the demand for unskilled workers declined relative
to the demand for skilled workers (Gottschalk, 1997; Katz & Murphy, 1992).
While the average cognitive skill level of school dropouts is quite low, there is considerable
variation among dropouts in cognitive skill levels. One could argue that, in an economy in which
cognitive skills are increasingly valued, differences in skills would translate into earnings
differences for dropouts just as they do for workers with greater educational attainments. On the
other hand, the economic trends that have depressed the average earnings of the less skilled may
have relegated most young dropouts to entry level jobs where skills matter very little and
consequently are not rewarded. This could be especially true for non-white male dropouts, whose
earnings in 1996 averaged 28 percent less than those of white male dropouts. This paper reports
evidence on the labor market payoff to cognitive skills for school dropouts, and whether the
payoff differs by gender and race/ethnicity.
Several problems hamper attempts to explore the impact of cognitive skills on labor market
performance. First, since the test scores that provide the measures of cognitive skills in most data
sets are of no consequence to the test-takers, the scores may provide underestimates of true
cognitive skills, especially for individuals who find test-taking distasteful. Second, the test scores
may be correlated with unmeasured variables such as motivation levels which affect labor market
performance. Consequently, correlations between test scores and labor market earnings may
reflect the importance of unmeasured motivation, rather than the causal impact of cognitive skills.
Third, many studies measure labor market performance by hourly wage. This excludes from the
analysis those individuals who are unable to find work as a result of low cognitive skill levels.
1

Finally, some data sets, such as the National Adult Literacy Survey, include only
contemporaneous information on cognitive skills and wages. This makes it difficult to identify
causation. It may be that individuals who obtain well paying jobs for reasons unrelated to
cognitive skill levels receive training that results in relatively high skill levels.
We examine the returns to cognitive skills using a data set that responds to the problems
listed above. This data set consists of information on a sample of individuals who dropped out of
school and later attempted to acquire a General Educational Development (GED) credential.
While this is not a random sample of all dropouts, data on these individuals do offer a number of
advantages. First, our measure of skills for these individuals is their standing on the GED exams, a
seven and one-half hour battery of exams covering mathematics, writing, reading, social studies,
and science. The GED exams represent a high-stakes test for the members of our sample. As a
result, we expect that individuals approach the tests with seriousness and effort, and hence scores
on these exams better measure underlying true skills than test scores in other data sets. Second, all
individuals in our data have exhibited a desire to obtain a GED, as evidenced by their willingness
to prepare for and attempt the lengthy battery of tests. Consequently, there is probably less
unmeasured variation in motivation among individuals in this data set than is the case among
participants in other surveys. Third, we measure labor market performance by annual earnings.
This allows us to include dropouts with zero earnings in our analysis sample. Finally, we measure
labor market earnings five years after dropouts last attempted the GED exams. This reduces the
problem of assessing the direction of causation of the correlation between test scores and
earnings.
We discuss the unique nature of our data in the next section, and we turn to our
methodology in Section 3. In Section 4 we present and discuss our results, and we show that
skills do matter for young dropouts, white and nonwhite, male and female.

2. Data
We analyze data containing information on the universe of dropouts in New York and
Florida who took the GED exams between 1986 and 1990 and were aged 16 to 21 when they last
took these exams. The data released to us by the departments of education in these states contain
2

basic demographic information and GED test scores. To obtain an outcome measure, we worked
with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to merge the state GED data with Social Security
taxable annual earnings via Social Security numbers. As detailed by Angrist (1997), SSA earnings
data such as those released to us have a number of limitations.1 One important limitation is that
for confidentiality reasons, the SSA does not release individual earnings to researchers. Rather,
they release aggregated data based on directions supplied by the researcher. Because the SSA will
only release aggregate data, we are only able identify individuals as “white, non-Hispanic” or as
“other than white, non-Hispanic.” For ease of exposition we call these two groups “whites” and
“nonwhites.”
SSA aggregation guidelines also preclude us from retaining continuous GED score
information. As a result, we retain GED test score information in our data by constructing ten
“score group” categories that reflect unique combinations of overall mean scores on the five tests
in the GED battery and minimum scores out of the five tests. While the relationship between these
score groups is not cardinal in nature, the score groups are ordinal and monotonic. Thus, a higher
score group represents a higher mean score, a higher minimum score, or both, and hence, a higher
level of measured skills.2 The construction of these GED test score groups is displayed in Figure
1.

<Figure 1 about here>

The rows in Figure 1 represent successively higher minimum score intervals. The minimum
score intervals are 5 points at the bottom end of the range and 2 points at the upper end. The two
columns in Figure 1 represent the two ranges of the mean score we use: less than a 45 mean score

1

Limitations regarding top coding, covered occupations, and other aspects of the SSA
earnings records are discussed by us in Tyler, Murnane, and Willett (1998). Our overall
conclusion is that these limitations do not provide serious problems for this research.
2

This is true except for the range around score groups 3 and 4. Individuals in score group
3 have lower mean scores than those in score group 4, but higher minimum scores (see Figure 1).
Thus, it is not clear which group has higher overall skill levels.
3

and a mean score of 45 or higher. We include in our models dichotomous indicators of 9 of the 10
score groups and interactions between each of the score group indicators and other variables of
substantive interest.
The cells in our data are defined by state (Florida or New York), year-of-test (1986-1990),
GED score group (1-10), gender, and race/ethnicity (white or nonwhite). For each cell the SSA
released the mean earnings in the cell, the standard deviation of earnings, and the cell frequency.

<Table 1 about here>

As indicated in Table 1, 46 percent of the individuals in the data set attempted the GED tests
in Florida and 53 percent in New York. The proportion male is about the same in both states and
is slightly higher than the proportion female. The sample from Florida is substantially more white
than the sample from New York. The distribution across the GED score groups is similar in the
two states, with Florida having a slightly higher percentage of dropouts scoring in the three
highest score groups.
Table 2 provides information for males on mean annual earnings (in 1995 constant dollars3)
five years after each cohort last took the GED exams. Table 3 provides the analogous information
for females.4 The entries in these two tables show that the annual earnings of young dropouts are
quite low, on average, regardless of the state or year. These low mean earnings suggest that
young dropouts are either employed in very low wage jobs, are often without employment (i.e.,
their mean earnings are zero), or both.

3

All earnings in the data are converted to 1995 constant dollars using the Consumer Price
Index-All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) index.
4

The lower unconditional mean earnings in New York, generally considered a high wage
state relative to Florida, is at least in part due to the higher percentage of nonwhite dropouts in
New York. In other data available to us, however, we observe that the lower New York mean
earnings are also due to a higher presence of zeros in the cells, as the mean of positive earnings is
higher in New York than Florida.

3. Statistical Analysis

Analytic Model
The data we use to examine the returns to skills for our sample of young dropouts consist
of 635 cells as described earlier. We are interested in yic, the true earnings of the ith person in the
cth cell. However, as a result of the nature of the data released to us by the Social Security
Administration, we only have a sample estimate of the mean earnings, µ c, in the cth cell. We

assume that yic = µ c + wic where wic Í N(0, 02 ).

We would like to examine the relationship between skills and earnings by fitting a series of
models in which the dependent variable is the cell population mean earnings µ c, and the
explanatory variables of primary interest are the GED score group and score group-demographic
group interactions associated with individuals who make up the cth cell. Our model is:
µ c ' $0 % $1 femalec % $2 nonwhitec % $3 state c %
$4 nonwhitec(femalec % $5 nonwhite c(statec %
"1 sgc % "2 sgc(femalec % "3 sgc(nonwhite c % "4 sgc(femalec(nonwhitec %

where c indexes cell and,
female = 1 if the cth cell is composed of females,
nonwhite = 1 if the cth cell is composed of dropouts who are nonwhite,
state = 1 if the cth cell is composed of dropouts who took the tests in New York,
sg = a vector of 9 dummy variables indicating whether the cth cell contains dropouts in
score group 2 or score group 3 or ...up to score group 10
cohort = 0 if individual i is in the 1986 testing cohort (and thus has earnings measured in
1991), 1 if in the 1987 cohort, ..., and 4 if in the 1990 cohort,5

5

In preliminary data analyses we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the earnings
of white and nonwhite females are jointly equal in New York and Florida, once we allow for a
5

ue = the state unemployment rate in state j and year k for 18-30 year-olds with only a high
school diploma, GED, or 0 to 11 years of schooling, and
v = a mean zero error term, assumed to be uncorrelated with the other regressors.
The "’s, $’s, and (’s in Equation 1 are parameters to be estimated. In particular, the "
parameters answer our main research questions. We control for state effects by including a
dummy for New York in the model. The inclusion of the nonwhite*state interaction further allows
the earnings of nonwhite dropouts to be different across Florida and New York.6 We control for
secular labor market trends in the years 1991-1995 by including the state-specific unemployment
rates for 18-30 year-olds with a high school degree or less.
Because individuals in score groups 5-10 have a GED in both Florida and New York, while
individuals in lower score groups do not (i.e., individuals in these score groups scored too low to
pass the GED exams), the estimates on all of the parameters associated with score groups 5-10
measure the effect of skills on earnings plus any additional effect of the GED on earnings.7 By
looking at the returns to skills within the 1-4 and the 5-10 groups separately, we can isolate the
effect of skills on earnings from the impact of the GED credential on earnings.

Estimation
We do not know the population µ’s, but we possess the sample estimates, µ^ , provided by
the Social Security Administration. We assume that

main effect of state on earnings and allow the earnings of all nonwhites to be different in the two
states. We are also unable to reject the null hypothesis that the joint effect of all the score group
dummies is the same across Florida and New York. Preliminary data analysis also indicates that
the effect of being in the various cohorts is the same by gender and by race/ethnicity.
6

We are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the earnings of white females are the
same in the two states once we control for overall state effects (p=0.505), nor can we reject the
null on a test that the joint effect of the score group dummies is the same in the two states
(p=0.950).
7

Tyler, Murnane, and Willett (1998) find an effect of the GED on earnings that is
independent of the effect of cognitive skills for dropouts just at the margin of passing the exams.

In our estimation we must account for the fact that the µ c’s are estimated with varying precision.
We want to fit Equation 1, which we will represent here as:
µ c ' xc * % v c ,

where x is a vector of the independent variables and * is a vector of regression parameters to be
estimated. However, because the µ c are unknown we must instead fit the following model:
µ̂ c ' xc * % (v c % uc) ' xc * % ,c

Efficient estimation of * in Equation (2) requires a consistent estimate of S, which, in turn,
requires estimates of each Tc2 and of F2. Estimates of the Tc2 are obtained by using the cell
variances (supplied by the SSA) to estimate the 0c2, in combination with the cell frequencies nc
(also supplied by the SSA). Following Hanushek (1974), we use a two-step estimator for F2. We
then use our estimate of S to form a Weighted Least Squares (WLS) fit of the model in Equation
(1).

4. Results

Table 4 presents WLS estimates for the parameters of Equation (1). Given the parameterization of
Equation (1), the estimate of the intercept in Table 4 indicates that the average annual earnings of
young white male dropouts in score group 1 in Florida who tested in 1986 were about $9,665.8
The earnings of comparable white females averaged about $4,200 less than this, and those of
nonwhite males in the same state, score group, and cohort were about $1,240 less. Meanwhile,
comparable nonwhite females earned about $3,300 less (!4190!1241+2129) than the baseline
group. The estimate of the coefficients on the state and the nonwhite*state variables indicate that
nonwhite dropouts tended to make about $659 (121!780) less per year in New York than in
Florida.

<Table 4 about here>

As stated earlier, parameters answering our primary research questions are the coefficients
associated with the score group dummies and with the score group-demographic group
interactions. Since the relationship of the score groups to one another is monotonic, we should

see a pattern indicating that higher earnings are associated with higher score groups (except
perhaps for the increment from score group 3 to score group 4). Looking down the list of
estimated coefficients on the main-effect score group dummies, we see that in all but two cases
this pattern holds true.9 Thus, for white males the pattern indicates that higher earnings are
associated with higher GED scores. This pattern also holds for the other three demographic
groups represented in the data: nonwhite males, white females, and nonwhite females.10
To clarify the returns to skills indicated by the estimates in Table 4, we tested a series of
hypotheses regarding different score group-earnings relationships. First, we wanted to know if
there was an overall increase in earnings associated with higher GED scores. To test this
hypothesis, we compared the average earnings of individuals in the highest score groups (score
groups 5-10) to the earnings of individuals in lowest score groups (groups 1-4). We chose these
combinations of score groups because they represent a comparison of GED-holders versus nonGED holders. That is, as stated earlier, individuals in both states in score groups 5 and higher had
scores high enough to be awarded a GED, while those in score groups 4 and lower failed the
GED exams. To examine the overall returns to skills plus a GED for our sample of dropouts we
conducted the following contrast for all four demographic groups,

While the point estimate drops from score group 3 to score group 4 (1887 to 1205) and

hypothesis that the estimates are equal.

to skills for the highest skilled dropouts (those in score groups 5-10). For the low-skilled
dropouts we compared the earnings of those in score groups 3 and 4 with the earnings of those in
score groups 1 and 2. For the high skilled dropouts we compared the earnings of those in score
groups 8-10 with the earnings of dropouts in score groups 5-7. Those two contrasts were

Contrast 3

The results of these contrasts for the four demographic groups in our study, along with the pvalues from the relevant hypothesis tests for equality, are presented in Table 5.

<Table 5 about here>

Row 1 in Table 5 shows the results from Contrast 1, the difference between the average
earnings of high skilled dropouts and those of low skilled dropouts, in each of the four
demographic groups. The entries in this first row indicate that all four demographic subgroups
realize substantial returns to higher GED scores, to acquisition of a GED, or to both.
Furthermore, these returns are greater for females than for males.11 Given the increase during the
1980s in the gap between the earnings of white males and those of black males (Bound and
Freeman 1992), it is notable that the economic return to skills is larger for nonwhite males than

11

We can reject the hypothesis that Contrast 1 for white males = Contrast 1 for white
females (p=0.000) and that Contrast 1 for nonwhite males = Contrast 1 for nonwhite females
(p=0.002).
10

for white males.12
A second question addressed in Table 5 is whether or not young dropouts experience returns
to skills even within more narrowly defined ranges of skills. Looking within more narrowly
defined skill groups also has the advantage of allowing us to examine the returns to skills while
controlling for the separate effect of GED acquisition on earnings. The second row of Table 5
shows the results from Contrast 2, the returns to skills for low skilled dropouts, and the third row
gives the results from Contrast 3, the returns for high skilled dropouts. The results in these rows
indicate that even within narrowly defined ranges, dropouts with higher GED scores experience
higher earnings. Moreover, with two exceptions, the economic returns to small differences in
measured skills are statistically significant and substantial, with higher scores translating into
about $1,000 to $1,400 more per year in earnings. The two exceptions are Contrast 3 for white
males and Contrast 2 for white females.
The next step is to formally examine differences in the returns to skills across the
demographic groups. If we focus only on the inter-group contrasts that are statistically significant
at the 0.05 level, the following patterns emerge. First, skills plus a GED (as captured in Contrast
1) matter more for females than for males and slightly more for nonwhites than for whites. The
average difference between Contrast 1 for females and Contrast 1 for males indicates that the
returns to skills plus a GED are about $1,200 greater for females than for males.13 A similar
comparison across race/ethnicity groups indicates that the average return to skills plus a GED is
about $208 greater for nonwhites than for whites.14
12

We can reject the hypothesis that Contrast 1 for white males = Contrast 1 for nonwhite
males (p=0.008). We cannot reject the hypothesis that Contrast 1 for white females = Contrast 1
for nonwhite females (p=0.339).
13

p=0.000 in a test that the average of cells 1 and 2 equals the average of cells 3 and 4 in

row 1.
14

p=0.000 in a test that the average of cells 1 and 3 equals the average of cells 2 and 4 in
row 1. Tyler, Murnane, and Willett (1998) find that, controlling for skills, GED acquisition is
much more important for young white dropouts on the margin of passing than for young nonwhite
dropouts on the margin of passing. Reconciliation of those results with the results in this current
study means that: (1) the “gross” returns to skills for nonwhite dropouts are substantially higher
than for white dropouts, (2) the returns to a GED for highly skilled nonwhite dropouts are greater
11

The story regarding returns to low-level skills is somewhat different. The figures in row 2 of
the table indicate that returns to low-level skills are about the same (approximately $1,000) for all
groups except for white females.15
Row 3 indicates that among higher skilled dropouts who all had a GED, higher scores means
higher earnings for all groups except young white males. Also, among the three groups exhibiting
statistically significant returns to higher skills, the returns are the greatest for nonwhite dropouts.16
In summary, three central stories emerge from an examination of the returns to skills within
narrowly defined gender, race/ethnicity, and skill categories. First, among individuals in almost
every demographic-skill group, greater cognitive skills as measured by GED exam scores led to
substantially higher earnings five years later. The exceptions are the highest skilled white male
dropouts and the lowest skilled white female dropouts. Second, we do not find that young
nonwhite dropouts are being relegated to jobs where skills do not matter. In fact, even among the
least skilled nonwhite male and female young dropouts, higher GED scores mean substantially
higher earnings. Finally, not all GED holders are treated the same in the labor market. That is,
except for white males, higher scoring GED holders earn substantially more than lower scoring
GED holders, and the returns to skills are largest for young nonwhite GED holders.
A fair question is whether the patterns displayed in Table 5 are different across Florida and
New York. In a model that includes all of the relevant state interactions, we can reproduce tables
similar to Table 5 separately for the dropouts who attempted their GED in Florida and those who
attempted their GED in New York. Doing this and comparing the twelve contrast by demographic
group cells as represented in Table 5, we can reject the hypothesis that the relevant contrast in
Florida equals the same contrast in New York in only two of the twelve instances. In particular,
we can reject that Contrast 1 and Contrast 3 for nonwhite males in Florida and New York are

than the returns to similarly skilled white dropouts, or (3) both (1) and (2) are true.
15

We reject the null in all comparisons with white females in row 2, and we cannot reject
the null in any of the comparisons between the other three groups in row 2.
16

p=0.051 on a test that the average of cells 2 and 4 equals cell 3 in row 3. However, we
cannot reject the nulls that cell 2 equals cell 3, that cell 4 equals cell 3, or that jointly cells 2 and 4
equal cell 3.
12

equal. In each of these two contrasts, the returns for nonwhite males are higher in Florida than in
New York. Thus, except perhaps for nonwhite males, Table 5 is a good representation of the
returns to skills five years after last taking the GED exams for young dropouts in both Florida and
New York in the first half of the 1990s.17
One final question of interest concerns the importance of age. Would the returns to skill be
the same if earnings were measured when the dropouts were younger? To answer this question,
we replicated our analyses using as the dependent variable annual earnings (in 1995 dollars) one
year after the dropouts in the sample last took the GED exams. Table 6, which is identical in
structure to Table 5, provide a summary of the results. Just as when the dropouts were four years
older (Table 5), skill differences are associated with statistically significant earnings differences in
all but two of the contrasts. However, the magnitudes of the earnings differences associated with
skill differences are, on average, about half as large among 17-22 year-old dropouts as they are
among the same groups when they are four years older. That the returns to cognitive skills
increase with age is a pattern also found in other studies (Altonji and Pierret 1996; Farber and
Gibbons 1996).

5. Conclusion

This study uses a unique, new data set to examine the relationship between the skills that young
dropouts bring to the labor market and their annual earnings. Our results, based on the earnings of
21-26 year-old dropouts who attempted the GED exams in Florida and New York in the years
1986 to 1990, have both discouraging and encouraging elements as we think about the labor
market prospects of young dropouts in the 1990s.
First, our data show that the average annual earnings levels of young dropouts are quite low.
Average unconditional earnings for males range from a low of $9,394 in New York in 1995 to a

17

The two entries for which we can reject the null of equality between the states suggest
the following situation: nonwhite males in Florida enjoy higher overall returns to skills than
nonwhite males in New York because more highly skilled nonwhite males in Florida have
significantly greater returns than do more highly skilled nonwhite males in New York.
13

high of $10,869 in Florida in 1995. The comparable figures for females are a low of $6,886 in
New York in 1995 and a high of $7,955 in Florida in 1994. Since these averages contain zero
earnings for individuals who did not work in a year, they represent the combined effect of wages
and labor supply on earnings.
More encouraging news is that for whites and nonwhites, males and females, skills are an
important determinant of earnings. Our results show that in the labor market of the early 1990s,
young high school dropouts could expect higher annual earnings if they had higher levels of basic
cognitive skills. Our results also show inter-group variation in the returns to skills, with females
generally having higher returns than males, and nonwhites, especially high skilled nonwhites,
having greater returns than white dropouts.
The significant economic return to modest skill differences among nonwhite male dropouts
sheds light on a puzzle in the random-assignment evaluation of the Perry Pre-School Program. As
Barnett (1996) has described, black males who participated in the early childhood intervention
program did not have greater educational attainments, on average, then did black males in the
control group. Yet, the black males in the treatment group did have somewhat higher average
earnings at age 27 than did black males in the control group. Barnett speculated that this may
have stemmed from the higher average cognitive skills of the treatment group, as measured by test
scores during their schooling years. The evidence presented in this paper on the economic returns
to skill differences for nonwhite male dropouts supports Barnett’s hypothesis.
Welfare reform is pushing many low-skilled individuals into a labor market where skills
increasingly matter. Our research, which measures skills with a high-stakes test (the GED exams)
and earnings with reliable administrative data (Social Security earnings), shows that higher
cognitive skills mean higher subsequent earnings for dropouts. This is the good news. However,
while our estimates of the returns to skills for many groups are large in percentage terms, we
caution that this is largely because these young dropouts have such low average annual earnings
to begin with. This is the bad news, and it is a strong argument against a decision to drop out in
the first place.
