PRODUCTION WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD
Arleen Leibowjtz*

Dramatic changes over the last thirty years in the amount
of time married women spend in the labor force are well docu-

mented. Census data indicate, for example, that while only
15 per cent of married women were in the labor force in 1940,
the comparable figure for 1950 was 24 per cent, for 1960,
31 per cent, and for 1972, 41.5 per cent.' This increase in
labor force participation has been accompanied by changes in
allocation of time to various activities in the household as
well, which have only recently come under detailed scrutiny.
A comparison of time budget studies over a 50—year period
shows that while the total amount of time spent in household
work by urban non-employed women has remained virtually constant
at approximately 53 hours per week, the proportion of time
spent in cooking and cleaning has decreased, while the proportion spent ii child care has increased (see Vanek). Today, as
in the past, employed women devote less time to household

production than non—employed women. Since the proportion of
women in the labor force has been rising, the average time
input to household tasks by all women has been declining over
the last 50 years.
Valuable insights into the labor supply of married women
have been gained by analyzing the problem in the household
production context. Jacob Mincer pioneered this approach in
which women are seen as choosing not simply between work and
leisure, but between work in the home, work in the market and

leisure.

While income affects the total amount of work, its
division between home and market depends on wage rates,
productivity in the home and the price and availability of
substitutes for the wife's labor in the home.
The educational attainment of women has increased considerably in the last 50 years, raising their productivity in

—2—
the market relative to the home, and therefore, drawing them

into the labor force. But what has been the effebt of schooling
on production within the home? Grossman has recently found that
a married man's health is positively related to his wife's
schooling level. Benham finds evidence to support this
hypothesis that the earnings of married men are positively
related to their wives' schooling. Michael finds that
education affects the efficiency with which contraception is
carried on.
In contrast to these papers, which relate a
woman's education to various household production outputs,
the present paper will try to determine how schooling affects
one of the inputs, of household production. Time budget data
will be used to determine how time allocation to various
activities vary with, schooling level.
I.

Household Production and Eciucation

A striking relationship found consistently by students of
female labor force behavior, (e.g., Cain, Bowen and Finegan)
is that more educated women are more likely to be in the labor
force. This is true in a classification of participation rates
by education and the relationship is even stronger when family
income is held constant (since women with more education tend
to have higher family incomes, which, ceteris paribus, reduces

labor supply). The most widely accepted explanation for this
association is that education has the nonneutral effect of
raising the productivity of labor market time more than that of
time spent in home production. Thus the "cost" of not being in
the labor market rises, inducing women to work outside the home.
Moreover, better-educated women can also the expected to
consume more leisure, if family income other than the wife's
earnings is positively correlated with the wife's education.
It follows that because women with more schooling spend a greater
proportion of their lifetime in the labor market, they must

—3—
normally spend a smaller proportion of their time in home pro-

duction, as household production analysis would predict from
their greater opportunity costs of time. As a result, other
inputs (purchased goods and others' time) will be substituted
for the wife's time in the production of all commodities and,
since the relative price of time—intensive commodities rises,
consumption will shift to less time intensive commodities.
Figure 1 verifies that the supply of labor to the market
is greater, the higher the level of schooling attained by the
woman, except that between the ages of 25 and 40 all women
supply nearly the same amount of labor to the market. (See
Leibowitz, 1972.) This implies that education does not cause
market productivity to exceed productivity in the home
equally for all activities, since during the ages when young
children are in the home, more educated women supply no more
labor to the market than other women.
The labor supply profiles imply that if labor supply is
determined as the result of process which optimizes the utility
of household production over the lifetime, child care must
differ from other kinds of household activities carried on
throughout the entire lifetime. If home production behavior is
consistent with known labor force behavior, child care must be
characterized by: 2

1. Smaller price elasticity and elasticity of
substitution between time and goods relative
to other household production, given that
the increase in ma±ket price of time exceeds
the increase in home productivity due to
rising education;

2. greater income elasticity; and/or
3. greater increases in home productivity relative
to market productivity, given price and substitution elasticity.

First,
production data is consistent with the. labor force data——that

is, more educated women do have smaller time inputs to house-

hold production carried on throughout the life cycle, but
greater time inputs to child care. Secondly, I will try to
ecamine the factors causing this difference.

II. Average Time Inputs to Household Activities
by Education
Time ihputs to various domestic activities were
calculated by the author from time budgets of 1,296 families
collected by Kathryn Walker.

Average time inputs to various household activities
are shown in Table 1 for women with up to four years of high
school and for women who had attended at least one year

of college. The low education group spent as much or more
of their own time as the high education group in the
two kinds of home production carried on throughout the life
cycle—-meal preparation and laundry work. This, and the
fact that husbands of women with more schooling spent greater
amounts of time in meal preparation, substituting their
OWfl time for their wives', is consistent with the greater
price of time of more educated women.

Note: Sample sizes for meal preparation and laundry time inputs
are 627 and 667 for high and low schooling groups. Since child
care averages are calculated only for families with children,
sample sizes are 493 and 591, respectively.
"Physical care" includes time spent in bathing, feeding, and dressing
children and in caring for a sick child. "Other care" was defined
as "all activities re1ateç1 to the social and educational development
of family members, such as: helping with lessons, reading to,
children, taking children to social and educational functions."
Preference ratings are averages of ratings of activities by homemakers on a scale from a low of 1 (extreme dislike) to 9 (like

In spite of their greater price of time, however, more
educated mothers spent more time in child care, both over-all

and per child. This is particularly striking in educational
care. This is not due to a substitution of the mothers' time
for the fathers' or other persons', since husbands of more
educated women also spent more time with their children.
A study of time use in Indiana families in 1961-62,
also shows that the greater the education of the wife, the
more time she spent in child care.
(See Leibowitz, 1973.)
Women with college degrees spent more than twice as many
hours in child care as women with less than 12 years of
schooling, 83 per cent more time than high school graduates,
and 59 per cent more time than women with one to three years

of college completed. The greater time expenditures of
more educated women are seen within age categories of
children as well as over all families.
Stafford and Hill (l973a) report that the increase in
home production time caused by the presence of a pre—school
child is twice as great in high SES families as in low SES
families. In addition, they find that education had a
positive impact on mothers' time inputs to children.
However, time inputs to other household tasks tend to fall
with education (although there is a tendency for time

inputs to rise slightly at the highest level).' In the
next section, the allocation of time within the household
is examined to understand these differences by schooling
level.

—7—
III. Regression Analysis of Time Inputs
If all home production activities had unitary income

elasticity, and equal elaticitie,s of substitution between
time and goods and if schooling had a neutral effect on
the productivity of time at home and in the market, we would
expect to find neither a positive nor a negative relation
between schooling and child care time inputs. However, if
schooling augments the productivity of time in the labor market
relative to time at home--and this would be consistent with
greater labor supply by more educated women—-the relative price
of time intensive goods would rise to more schooled women.

It is widely believed that care of pre—chool children
is a time intensive activity as compared to other forms of
home production. Thus the home production price of child care
is greater for more educated women, due to their higher
opportunity cost of time. This is one rationale for the lesser
number of children desired (and produced) by more educated
women. (See Willis and Michael.) Yet in spite of the higher
relative cost of child care faced by more educated women,
they spend more time in child care, both in total and per
child. Child care must be characterized by one or more of
the above three factors—-smaller elasticity of substitution
among inputs, greater income elasticity or greater increases
in home productivity relative to market productivity with
increases in schooling, as contrasted with other home
production that is not concentrated in the child rearing years.
To determine how these factors operate to counteract
the relatively greater cost of child care for more educated
womer, more detailed analysis of the Cornell data was

undertaken. For each of four activities, time inputs were
regressed on demand factors (such as income and number of
children ip various age classes), which increase tI'ke marginal

—8—
productivity of time in the home, and should be positively
related to time inputs;productivity factors (such as wife's
education and' age); and presence of substitutes (such as

capital goods and time inputs by others).
In Table 2 we see that time inputs to meal preparation

depend on demand factors with time inputs decreasing
monotonically with increasing age of children. The income
proxies, rooms per capita and husband's
tively but not significantly related to
spent by the husband in preparing meals
substitute for the wife's time reducing

education are positime inputs. Time
acts as a
it by five minutes

for each ten minutes of the husband's time.

Among the

productivity variables, education has no significant impact
on time inputs to meal preparation, but older women spend
more time at this àcthLvity.
In laundry work, capital yoods significantly affect

time required for a given number of loads washed or a given
family size.5 For exampi?, the housewife who used a non-'
automatic washer spent 39 minutes more in washing than one
the

who used an automatic washer.

More educated women have more

and better quality capital goods, but even holding these
factors constant in the regression, the net effect of
education was to decrease time inputs to laundry work.

In Table 3, we see time

inputs to physical care of
to the number and ages of children.

While each child under one year, requires an additional
208 minutes of care over a two—day period from his mother, a
one—year old adds 112 minutes, and each 2—5 year old adds
only 26 minutes. Older children may reduce the demands on
the mother's time, presumably by helping with the feeding
and dressing of younger siblings.

The productivity effect, measured by the wife's
education, is positive but not very significant. Since education is also a proxy for the value of time in the market, weak
coefficients may be caused by a substitution effect due to
the rise in the price of time partially offsetting the positive
substitution effect due to increased home productivity.
The income proxies, husbar-l's education and rooms per
capita, are not significantly different from zero. The latter

has the wrong sign which may be due to the fact that greater
numbers of rooms indicate not only greater income, but also
greater demand for time in such activities as cleaning. Women
who prefer physical care spend more time at it than women
who rate it less highly.6

Husband's time was shown to be a substitute for the wife's
in meal preparation, but this is riot the case in physical

care. The significantly positive coefficient on husband's
time inputs indicates that for each ten minutes the husband
spends in physical care, the wife puts in an additional
four minutes. This is not merely an indication of the family's
tastes (since these are controlled for by the "preference"
variable, but may indicate true complementarity——increased
inputs of husband's time increasing the marginal productivity
of the wife's time inputs. Time spent by others in the care
of children had no significant effect on the mother's time
inputs.

The sample was next divided into a high education group
including 493 women with some college training, and a low
education group including 591 women who had not gone beyond
high school. Columns 2 and 3 refer to the high and low
schooling subsamples respectively, they indicate that

other than the parents—-seem to act as a substitute for own
time in the low education group, but not for those with more
schooling.

The next three equations deal with time inputs to other
care-—which includes time spent in social and educational
activities with children. As with physical care, time inputs
are clearly related to the number and ages of children.
Again the husband's time inputs are complementary to the
wife's time, while time inputs by others are only weak
substitutes for the wife's time. For each 100 minutes of
care by others, the wife reduces her own time inputs by

only three minutes. The positive coefficient on husband's
education may reflect a positive income effect, but rooms
per capita, the second income proxy, is not significantly
related to time inputs.
When the data is again split into high and low schooling
subsaniples, differences in the age pattern of time inputs
appear——the low schooling group spends decreasing amounts of
time as the children age, whereas time inputs peak for one
year old children of the higher education group.
Time inputs by others have a negative impact on time
spent with children by less schooled mothers (which is
significant at the one per cent level) , but: t1vy hvc no
on time inputs by mothers with more schooiinq. That is,
mothers with less schooling act as if time inputs by older
children and other adults are a better substitute for their
own time than do the more educated mothers.

ett'ct

— 13 —
The substitutes——baby sitters, 9randmoth.ers, other children
over six, are more similar in education and ability to the
mothers with little schooling. However, if education increases
the productivity of time in child care, more educated women
would find these other workers relatively unsatisfactory sub-

stitutes. In fact, mothers in the high education group spend
the same amount of time in child care whether or not other
workers also care for their children.

Consistent with these results is Stafford and Hill's
finding (1973b) that in high status families (defined by
husband's education or occupation) time inputs to pre-school
children are invariant with the number of other children in
the family, while in low status families, mothers reduce their
time inputs to pre—school children as family size increases.
This behavior on the part of more educated mothers in addition
to their greater price of time increases the "cost" to them

of children and ac to reduce their demand for children.
Further, since the mother's time inputs will not be reduced
when older children care o their younger siblings, there is
less incentive for wide spacing of children on the part of
more educated mothers. In fact, Sue Ross has found that more
educated mothers have shorter intervals between births.
The fact that more educated women spend more of their
own time in child care in spite of the higher price of their
timeis due partly to the low substitution elasticity with
other factors, as contrasted with two other household activities.
In addition, there may be high income elasticity for spending
own time or increased productivity of time in child care with
increased education. There is evidence for the income effect,

since greater productivity of more educated womens time in
child care could not alone account for the greater time inputs
by husbands and other adults in familieswhere the wife is
highly educated.

— 14

The historical evidence also supports the hypothesis of

high

income elasticity for using own time in child care.

Vanek (1973) finds in samples ranging back to 1926 that higher
SES women spent more time in child care, and that "contemporary non—employed women spend about ten hours a week more
in family care than women in earlier samples." That the
income elasticity of child care exceeds that for other
housework can also be imputed from Vanek's finding that contemporary women lower their standards for housework when
child care demands are highest.
Although more educated women have greater labor supply
and spend less time in home production over most of the

life cycle, they spend more time in child care. This time
substantial investment in
devoted by parents represents
the human capital of their children. Evidence is beginning
to accumulate that these investments do affect the early
achievement of children as well as their ultimate level of

schooling. (See Leibowitz, l97z.) The finding that time
investments are greater for more educated mothers helps to
explain the observed positive correlation between children's
achievement and their mother's schooling. (See Kagan and
Moss.)

The time allocations of more educated women in the 1920's
foreshadowed the allocation decisions of all women in the

1960's. If the contemporary sample also forecasts the future,
we can cautiously predict that when the average woman has
more schooling and higher income than today, she will indeed
spend a greater proportion of her lifetime in the labor forc:e.
Although she will probably spend less of her increasingly
valuable time in most home production activities, she is
likely to spend even more of it with children.
