Modeling College Major Choices using Elicited Measures of Expectations and Counterfactuals

ABSTRACT
The choice of a college major plays a critical role in determining the future earnings of college graduates.
Students make their college major decisions in part due to the future earnings streams associated with
the different majors. We survey students about what their expected earnings would be both in the major
they have chosen and in counterfactual majors. We also elicit students’ subjective assessments of their
abilities in chosen and counterfactual majors. We estimate a model of college major choice that incorporates
these subjective expectations and assessments. We show that both expected earnings and students’
abilities in the different majors are important determinants of student’s choice of a college major. We
also show that students’ forecast errors with respect to expected earnings in different majors is potentially
important, with our estimates suggesting that 7.5% of students would switch majors if they made no
forecast errors.

Introduction

Numerous studies have documented large differences in earnings across different college majors.1
For example, Grogger and Eide (1995) find that one-quarter of the change in the college wage
premium for men was driven by a shift from low-paying to high-paying majors. And, James,
Nabeel, Conaty and To (1989, p. 252) argue that “while sending your child to Harvard appears
to be a good investment, sending him to your local state university to major in Engineering, to
take lots of math, and preferably to attain a high GPA, is an even better private investment.”
Given these large earnings differences across majors, economists have analyzed the extent to
which students sort into majors as a function of such differences.2 At the same time, differences
in student ability and aptitudes also have been found to influence choice of college majors. For
example, Turner and Brown (1999) provide evidence of ability sorting across majors by SAT
scores, and Paglin and Rufolo (1990) argue that the difference in the mathematical ability is the
main reason for the difference in the major choice and earnings between male and female.3
In this paper, we examine the factors that influence college major choice. Borrowing from
standard economic models of schooling decisions (Becker, 1964; Ben-Porath, 1967; Mincer, 1974),
we model the choice of a college major by comparing the returns to different majors with the costs
associated with completing them. As noted above, economists typically focus on the expected
earnings streams that result from different educational choices to measure their returns. In the
context of majors, such earnings streams are, themselves, associated with alternative careers,
or occupations, that majoring in a particular subject make more or less likely. For example,
majoring in biology (or pre-med) is likely to affect one’s chances of becoming a medical doctor
and realizing the earnings stream associated with a career in medicine. With respect to the
costs of schooling, economic models tend to focus on a student’s ability or abilities to complete
years of schooling more efficiently and effectively. Finally, some models of schooling decisions
emphasize the consumption value of education, as students may enjoy the content of courses in
some majors more than others and/or find the career paths associated with particular majors
to be more enjoyable than others.
One of the key problems in implementing and assessing models of educational choices, including that for majors, is the lack of data on the constructs of such models. In particular,
one typically does not directly observe a student’s expected earnings associated with alternative
majors or in their abilities in different majors. Rather, economists typically have, at best, data
on the earnings streams for majors that are actually chosen. After dealing with selection issues,
economists need to make strong assumptions about how students form expectations for earnings
across these different educational paths in order to estimate their choice models. Furthermore,
researchers often have only limited information on students’ relative abilities outside their chosen
majors. Again, assumptions must be invoked for what a student’s ability would be in majors
not chosen.
To address the issue of students’ expectations of earning across different major-career com1

See Daymont and Andrisani (1984); Hamermesh and Donald (2008); Grogger and Eide (1995); James, Nabeel,
Conaty and To (1989); Loury (1997); Loury and Garman (1995).
2
See for example Arcidiacono (2004, 2005) and Montmarquette, Cannings and Mahseredjian (2002).
3
We note that this ability sorting explanation seems less able to explain the underrepresentation of women in
more lucrative majors, as researchers (Friedman, 1989; Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko, 2006) have found that the
gender gap in math and science aptitude is small and has decreased for several decades.

binations, we conducted a survey of male undergraduates at Duke University. We elicited from
each student the probabilities he would be in particular careers in the future as well as they
earnings he might expect to earn in them. Students were asked these questions both for the
major they actually chose as well as for the other majors they could have chosen but did not,
i.e., for their counterfactual majors. In addition, we asked students to provide information about
their relative abilities in their own and all other possible majors.
An obvious potential concern with the elicitation of such information, especially with respect
to their expectations about future careers and earnings associated with them, is the accuracy
of these forecasts. Students may not have a very good idea of such phenomena, especially for
majors they have not chosen, and, thus, their forecasts of earnings may be subject to forecast
errors. Such errors may be more of an issue for students early in their college careers, i.e.,
freshmen and sophomores, relative to those who are closer to completing their degrees and closer
to having to make career decisions, i.e., juniors and seniors. To get a sense of the importance
of such forecast errors and how they may differ across students, we also elicited from students
their expectations on how much the average Duke student would make in different major-career
combinations. To the extent that all students have the same information about what careers
associated with different majors would pay in the future, we should not find any differences in
these expectations for the average Duke student, consistent with no forecast errors.4
Based on a simple characterizations of the data from our survey, we find evidence of sorting
on the basis of both expected earnings and ability. With the exception of the lowest paying
majors, most students state their expected earnings are highest (or second highest) in the major
they actually chose. At the same time, the majority of students indicate that they expect their
earnings to be higher or at least as high if they had majored (or are majoring) in economics.
Furthermore, we find clear evidence of ability sorting as the students in our study are much more
likely to state that they are more able (more competitive) in the major that they choose relative
to the ones they did not. To disentangle the relative importance of ability and expected earnings
on the choice of major, we formulate and estimate a model of major choice while also allowing
for different preferences over careers. Our model-based estimates clearly indicate that expected
earnings do matter for student’s choice of major, even after controlling for ability and career
preferences. For example, a one standard deviation increase in business careers shifts the fraction
of students choosing economics from 19.7% to 22.9%, a sixteen percent increase. Although there
is sorting on expected earnings, our evidence indicates that students prefer majors that they are
good (or more able) at, which is consistent with the findings in Arcidiacono (2004). Equalizing
student abilities across majors would drop the fraction of humanities majors from 9.3% to 5.9%
while increasing the fraction of economics majors to 23.8%.
Expectations over future earnings are likely to be subject to forecast errors. For example,
individuals have differing expectations regarding the market returns to particular fields. To
understand how these expectations differ across students of different majors, we asked students
what the average Duke student would make in different majors. These assessments suggest that
students think the market premium is higher for their own major compared to those for majors
they did not choose. We show under what assumptions we can purge the student’s expected
earnings of measurement error and use our model to forecast the major choices of the students
with expected earnings free of the forecast error. We estimate that over 7.5% of students would

Obviously, finding that students have the same assessments of the earnings and career expectations for the
average Duke student also is consistent with all students having a common, but non-zero, forecast error.

switch majors if this forecast error was not present. Thus, our results suggest an important role
for informational differences in modeling the choice of college major and, given our evidence
of heterogeneity in the resulting forecast errors, of the importance of eliciting information on
expectations from survey respondents.
Our work fits into a large and growing literature on the use of subjective expectations.5 More
recently, work has begun to incorporate subjective expectations into models of choice behavior.6
Our work builds on the recent literature of Delavande (2008), Kaufman (2009), and Zafar (2008,
2009) who use counterfactual expectations of choice models. Of particular relevance to our work
is Zafar (2008, 2009), who also examines counterfactual expectations and the choice of major.
Zafar (2008) focuses on gender differences in the choice of major while Zafar (2009) examines
the how expectations change over time regarding major fit and the probability of graduating
conditional on major choice. Zafar’s work finds no evidence of expected earning affecting the
choice of major. Zafar’s work was very informative in our own survey design. By linking majors
to careers, we sought to obtain more accurate measures of the students’ expected earnings across
majors. In addition, we drew a larger sample than Zafar and limited it to one gender (men)
in an attempt to minimize the potential for finding insignificant effects of expected income, or
other measures, on students’ choice of a major due to low statistical power in estimation.7
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe a simple model of major
choice that motivates the survey design. In Section 3, we describe the data we collected in our
survey and present a descriptive analysis of these data, showing the sorting patterns on both
expected earnings and ability. In Section 4, we develop an empirical model of the choice of college
major where expected income at only one point in time is sufficient for estimation. In Section 5,
we present the estimation results and examine how changing abilities and earnings would affect
the choice of major. In Section 6, we formulate a model of how to extract expectation error from
expected earnings and then show how removing this error would affect major choice. Section 7
concludes the paper.

Modeling College Major Choice

To help motivate our data collection, we first sketch a model of college major choice. As implied
by most models of human capital production (Ben-Porath, 1967), we assume that individuals
specialize in college early in the life cycle and then enter working careers for the remainder of
their lives. While in college, we assume that individuals choose from among J majors based upon
the benefits and costs received while in college, as well as the subsequent returns in the labor
market careers associated with the choice of a major. The in-college flow utility is a function
of the ith individual’s abilities in a given major, Aij , as well as their preferences for studying
particular subjects, ξij . Denote the in-school utility of individual i from choosing major j as

(1999).

Zafar’s sample consisted of 161 students, of which 92 were women and 69 were men. We gathered data on
173 students, all of whom were men, giving us a sample that is over 2.5 times larger than that used by Zafar to
estimate his college choice model for men.

u(Aij , ξij ).
Students trade off this current utility with the expected value of future utility associated with
choosing major j, EVij . This expected utility embeds a student’s expectations about K possible
careers that they may end up in, conditional on a given major and the expected payoffs from
such careers. Let Pijk denote the probability of ending up in career k, conditional on major j for
the ith individual and let EVijk denote the corresponding expected value of the career-specific
value function. As for the expected payoffs from careers, we focus on the expected earnings
associated with different major-career combinations, Yijk . Finally, we assume that the student
chooses a major according to:
X
arg max u(Aij , ξij ) + β
Pijk EVijk (Yijk )
(1)
j

k

where β is the discount rate.
In our survey, we elicited from students their subjective expectations of each component of
the above model of college major choice. Namely, we elicited measures of each student’s abilities
(Aij ), the probabilities of their entering alternative careers, conditional on their pursuing each
of the J majors (Pijk ), as well as the corresponding earnings for each of the J × K majorcareer combinations (Yijk ). We also asked students to provide us with direct assessments of
their preference orderings over all of the J possible majors. In Section 4, we discuss how we use
these orderings to produce one set of estimates of an empirical model of college major choice.
The above model of college choice abstracts from a number of considerations. First, we
assume that students make a one-time decision about their college major. In fact, students
may change their majors over the course of their college careers. As discussed in Kang (2009),
we did ask students about any changes they made in their major since coming to Duke. Less
than 20% of the (male) students in our survey had changed their majors, with most of these
changes reported by upper-classmen (juniors and seniors). Second, we ignore the possibility
that students may continue their education by seeking post-baccalaureate degrees. Again, we
asked students about their plans for continuing their educations and we found that almost all
of the Duke students we surveyed (91%) planned to seek an advanced degree. Given this high
percentage, we do not try to model attending graduate school in this paper.8 However, we expect
that students factored in graduate school in the probabilities and expected earnings we elicited
from them about careers (e.g., a career in Law is likely to require going to law school). Third,
the above 2-period model does not allow for the possibility that earnings in careers, and careers
themselves, might be expected to change over a student’s life cycle. With respect to careers, we
asked students to provide expectations about broad careers, rather than narrow occupations, in
an attempt to mitigate planned occupation switching. In what follows, we focus our attention
on students’ expected earnings 10 years out from graduation and, in Section 4, we outline a set
of simplifying assumptions under which we only need a forecast for a single year in the future.
Finally, we note that the above model assumes that, per se, careers are not chosen, but occur
at random, conditional on the choice of a major. While not developed in this paper, the data
we have gathered on career probabilities and expected earnings can be used to estimate a more
general model of college major and career choice than is considered herein.
8
Furthermore, the fact that most students in our sample plan to go to graduate school seriously compromises
what we can learn from students’ responses to our questions about their earnings expectations one year after
graduating from Duke. Accordingly, we focus our analysis in this paper on students responses to questions about
their expectations about earnings 10 years after graduating from Duke.

Data from Survey of Duke Undergraduates

We administered a survey of male undergraduate students at Duke University between February
and April in 2009. Gender was the only restriction on sample recruitment; students from any
major, class or race were eligible to participate in the survey. We recruited our sample members
by posting flyers around the Duke campus about our study. Surveys were administered on
computers in a designated room in Duke’s student union. All students who completed the
survey were paid $20. Our sample consists of 173 students who completed our survey.9
In addition to data on career and income expectations, we collected data on students’ background characteristics and their current or intended major. Table 1 presents a summary of the
characteristics of our sample and compares them with the corresponding characteristics of the
male undergraduate population at Duke. Due to the large number of majors offered at Duke
University, we divided the majors into six broad groups: natural science, humanities, engineering, social sciences, economics, and policy. The classification system of the majors is reported
in Table 2.10 Those who had already declared their majors were asked to provide us with their
current major; those who have not declared were asked to provide us with their intended major.
While our sampling strategy was not systematically random, one can see from Table 1 that our
sample corresponds fairly closely to the Duke male undergraduate student body. Our sample
includes slightly more Asians and fewer Latinos and Blacks than is at Duke. It also appears
that a higher percentage of our sample receives some financial aid than is the case in the Duke
student body, although the 22.0% figure for the student body is based on aid provided by Duke,
whereas the higher percentage of students receiving financial aid (40.5%) is likely due to the fact
that our survey asked about receipt of financial aid, regardless of source.

Expectations about Future Careers

In our survey, we elicited students’ expectations about future careers and how much they expected to earn in them. We asked each student the probability that they would choose a
particular career and the income they would expect to receive if they were in that career, conditional on their having majored in each of the majors listed in Table 2. We used the following
six broad career groups to characterize possible careers: science/technology, health, business,
government/non-profit, education and law. These groups were based on the distribution of the
careers that the Duke undergraduates have historically entered after they graduated. Sample
means, taken over the full sample, for expected income 10 years after graduation and probabilities associated with the alternative careers, conditional on a student majoring in each possible
field, are presented in Table 3.11
There are several interesting patterns in Table 3 with respect to the expectations elicited
about careers from our sample of undergraduates. First, there are marked differences in the

There are four different schools at Duke in which undergraduates are enrolled: Trinity College (college of arts
and sciences), Pratt School of Engineering, Nicholas School of the Environment, and Sanford School of Public
Policy.

For those respondents whose probabilities for each choice did not add up to 1 or 100, their stated probabilities
were proportionally adjusted so that the sum of the probabilities associated with the career choices is 1.

probabilities of entering the six careers across the various majors. Some careers appear to be
tied to certain majors, whereas other careers are less so. For example, if students were to major
in the (natural) Sciences or Engineering, the probability of going into Science or Health related
careers is fairly high, compared to if the students were to major in one of the other fields. A
similar pattern occurs for entering a career in the field of Education, which is more likely if a
student were to major in the Humanities compared to other majors. In contrast, the probabilities
of going into a Business career are relatively high for all majors. This is especially true for being
an economics major, where students indicate that the probability of going to a Business career
is .515, which is substantially higher than the career probabilities found for any of the other
majors. The “link” between career and majors for the other careers falls somewhere between
these two extremes. Second, student expectations about the earnings in careers 10 years out
did not vary much across the major fields we asked them to condition their responses on. Put
differently, students in our sample appear to view future earnings to be primarily determined by
what career one enters, with little role for the major field in which one might have studied.
The sample means presented in Table 3 are calculated over all students in the sample, regardless of whether they are majoring (or intending to major) in a particular field and of what
class they are in. It is of interest to consider how the expectations elicited differed by a student’s

† To elicit career probabilities, students were asked: “Suppose you majored in each of the following

academic fields [Sciences, Humanities, Engineering, Social Sciences, Economics, Public Policy].
What are the probabilities that you will pursue the following career field [science, health, business,
government/non-profit, education, law] AFTER majoring in this academic field.”
‡
To elicit expected earnings associated with different careers and majors, students were asked:
“For the following questions regarding future income, please answer them in pre-tax, per-year,
U.S. dollar term, ignoring the inflation effect. Suppose you majored in the following academic
field. How much do you think you will make working in the following career 10 years after
graduation?”

class/year at Duke and by whether the student was majoring in a particular major or not. With
respect to both dimensions, we might expect differences, by one’s major and class/year, in the
information students have about different careers. For example, underclassmen might have less
information about careers than do upperclassmen, since the latter group is closer to graduation
and, thus, may be devoting more time to learn about their future prospects. Similarly, students
who were majoring in a particular field may have a better idea about the earnings potential of
careers more closely related to their field of study than would be the case for non-majors. It also
may be the case that students who major in a field expect that they have an major-specific absolute advantage in certain careers, because of their major-specific abilities. In Table 4, we present
the differences in the means for expected earnings (10 years out) for the various career-major
combinations between students who majored in the particular career versus those who did not
(non-majors) and between upper- and under-classmen. We also display in this table results for
hypothesis tests of differences between these groups in student earnings expectations.
While there is no clear pattern to differences in majors vs. non-majors and upper- vs. underclassmen for most of the various careers and major fields, there are a couple of notable exceptions
in Table 4. First, students who are currently majoring in Policy have markedly higher income
expectations than students majoring in other fields for all careers but those in Health. Furthermore, several of these differences are statistically significant. For example, Policy majors expect

to earn more than 50% higher salaries ($84,171) if they enter the field of Law than if non-majors
were to enter the same field having majored in Policy. Second, we find that upperclassmen,
regardless of their major, expect to earn less if they enter either a Science or Education careers
than do underclassmen, with differences for Education careers being statistically significant. The
two patterns just cited may be due to systematic differences in the tastes and/or abilities of Policy
majors or in upper- versus underclassmen with respect to Education careers. But, a potentially
more plausible explanation is that there are differences in information between groups – e.g.,
upper-classmen may have more information than underclassmen about the low earnings of careers in Education careers based on the former group’s greater preparations for life-after-college
– and these differences lead to systematically different forecasts. Below, we present some results
concerning students’ expected earnings for the average Duke student that are quite consistent
with the differences-in-forecasts explanation.
We use the earnings expectations and career probabilities that we elicited for the alternative
career-major combinations to form major-specific expected earnings by computing the weighted
averages of the career-major expected earnings, using the career probabilities associated with
each specific major as weights. Sample means for these major-specific expected earnings, 10
years out, are given in Table 5. Unlike the sample means presented in Table 3, the sample
means in Table 5 are for students who are majoring in or intend to major in each of the major
fields. According to the theoretical model of college major choice outlined in Section 2, we would
expect to find that students are more likely to major in fields in which they have a comparative
expected earnings advantage. Looking along the diagonals in Panel A of Table 5, we do see
evidence of income sorting in choice of majors. For all but those whose “own major” is in the
field of Humanities, students expect that the earnings in their own major is the highest, or
second highest, compared to all of the other majors. This pattern is seen in Panel B of Table 5,

which records the proportion of students who indicate that the expected earnings in their own
major is the highest, or at least as high, compared to the majors they did not choose.12
At the same time, we also find that the majority of students would expect that they would
have their highest, or at least as high of, earnings if they majored in Economics, regardless of their
actual major. Looking back at the career probabilities and expected incomes for different careermajor combinations in Table 3, it is clear that this finding is driven by the combination of the high
expected incomes that all students associate with Business careers and, more importantly, the
fact that students think majoring in Economics is much more likely to lead to a career in Business
(probability = .515) relative to all other majors. As a result, the majority of students expect
to have an absolute income advantage to majoring in Economics, even though only slightly less
than 20% of Duke male undergraduates have chosen to do so. Thus, while we do find evidence
in our data of income sorting in the choice of college majors, it appears that there are other
factors that influence students decisions. We consider one of them, a student’s abilities in various
majors, in the next section.

3.2

Assessments of Abilities in Alternative Majors

In our survey, we also elicited measures of students’ perceived abilities for each of the major
fields. In particular, we asked each student to rate their competitiveness relative to their peers
at Duke in each of the six majors. All else equal, we would expect students to sort to the
major in which they have a comparative ability advantage. In Table 6 we see clear evidence of
12

Some students gave the same expected earnings for two or more majors. As a result, 17.3% of the students
had two or more majors with the highest expected earning.

such advantage. Looking along the diagonals of either Panel A, which gives the average student
ability ratings in their own major, or of Panel B, which gives the proportion of students that had
the highest ability rating in their own major, one sees strong evidence of sorting by ability in
choice of major fields. Furthermore, ability sorting in choice of a major appears to be stronger
than sorting on expected future earnings. In particular, note that the proportion of students
with their highest ability rating in their own major (the diagonal elements of Panel B) are much
higher than the proportion of students that have their highest expected earnings in their own
major (the diagonal elements of Panel B in Table 5).
Finally, the ability ratings of students also appear consistent with one’s sense of the difficulty
of the curriculums across majors. Looking at the average ratings taken over all majors for each
of the major fields, we find that the average student finds Engineering the most challenging field
(2.532), followed by Economics (3.058) and the average student finds that Social Science (3.590)
and Humanities (3.428) are the least difficult majors.

3.3

Expectations for the “Average” Duke Student

Students can differ in their forecasts of future expected earnings in different careers and majors
precisely because they differ in their abilities to succeed in different majors and, subsequently,
in various careers. But, as noted in the Introduction, students’ expectations about the future
also can differ because they make forecast errors. Without waiting for ten years to find out their
actual earnings (and career choices), we cannot get direct measures of such errors and examine

their properties. But we can determine the relative properties of students’ forecasts by asking
all students to make forecasts about the future for a similar event or person. In our survey,
we asked each student to provide us with their assessments of what the “average” Duke [male]
undergraduate would earn in different career-major combinations to parallel the questions we
asked of students about their expectations about their own future earnings. In particular, we
asked:
Suppose an average Duke student majored in [Sciences, Humanities, Engineering,
Social Sciences, Economics, Public Policy]. How much do you think he will make
working in the following careers [Science, Health, Business, Government, Education,
Law] 10 years after graduation?

of students’ expected earnings for the average Duke student i.e., (Y jk10 = N1 N
i=1 Yijk10 ) in
Table 7. In general, the expected earnings for the average Duke student for the different careermajor combinations are similar to the corresponding student expectations about their own future
earnings in Table 3. However, there are differences between the two sets of forecasts.

To provide a sense about the extent to which students’ earnings expectations are subject to
forecast errors, we compared the expected earnings for the average Duke student between majors
and non-majors and between upper- and under-classmen. The results of these comparisons are
reported in Table 8. The structure of Table 8 parallels Table 4. While most of the differences in
means between majors and non-majors and upper- and under-classmen are not that sizeable or
statistically different at conventional levels of significance, there are some notable exceptions. In
particular, Policy majors consistently have higher forecasts of expected earnings for the average
Duke student compared to students who are not Policy majors. Furthermore, upper-classmen
consistently have lower forecasts of the expected earnings that the average Duke student would
have in Education careers than do under-classmen. Recall that we found in Table 4 differences in
the same direction for the corresponding comparisons of students’ expectations about what their
own earnings would be and that these differences in that Table also were statistically significant.
Taken together these findings strongly suggest that expectations about future earnings are,
indeed, subject to forecast errors and that such errors are likely to influence students’ choice
of majors in non-trivial ways. We explicitly examine this influence in section 6, where we use

errors from students’ own expected earnings and examine how students’ choice of majors would
change in the absence of such errors.

Empirical Model of College Major Choice

In this section, we lay out an empirical model of college major choice in order to examine the
interplay of students’ ability, expected income and preferences over majors and careers. As noted
in Section 2, we based our data collection on a model of how students made their college major
decisions. We now provide an explicit characterization of that model, as well as a specification
of the process generating students’ expected future earnings associated with alternative careers
and majors that require expectations data on earnings for only one point in students’ futures.
As noted in Section 2, we assume that a student’s choice of major is a one-shot decision,
i.e., we do not allow students to change their majors. Furthermore, to simplify our analysis, we
assume that once students have made their major decisions, they do not choose their careers
upon graduation, but rather face a lottery over alternative careers, where the probabilities of
being assigned to particular careers depend upon their choice of major. Following the notation
in Section 2, let Pijk denote the probability of i being assigned career k conditional on choosing
major j. Once he realizes his draw on a career, the student makes no further decision and reaps
the “benefits” of his choice of major and the outcome of his career assignment. These benefits
come in the form of the consumption he can realize in each remaining period of his lifetime and,
as we describe below, preferences over careers.
13

4.1

Earnings and Consumption

We now lay out a set of assumptions that allow us to express a student’s expected future streams
of utility from consumption associated with alternative major-career pairs as a parsimonious
function of the expected earnings for these pairs that we elicited in our data. Let Yijkt denote
the earnings for individual i, with major j and career k, in future period t, where Yijkt is the
following function of the individual’s permanent premium for the major-career combination,
µijk , a growth rate which is major-specific but neither career or individual-specific, gjt ,13 and a
mean-zero transitory error term, ijkt :
Yijkt = exp(µijk + gjt + ijkt )

(2)

Individuals are assumed not to know ijkt until after they choose their major, so that they only
have expectations of the future ’s at the time they are making this decision.
We assume that the individual’s utility in period t is proportional to the log of his consumption in that period, lnCijkt , and that there is no savings so that individuals consume their
earnings in each period, i.e., Cijkt = Yijkt .14 Normalizing the price of consumption to one,
the expected present discounted value of the utility associated with consumption if individual i
C , is given by:

(3)

where β is the rate of time preference and α is the (utility) value of log consumption.
It follows from (2) that a student’s beliefs about the earnings associated with different majorcareer combinations 10 years after graduating from college, Ŷijk10 , is given by:
Ŷijk10 = E[exp(µijk + gj10 + ijk10 )]

(4)

We assume that the ’s have the same moments across i and k, conditional on major j. It follows
C as a function of Ŷ
that E[exp(ijk10 )] = E[exp(ijk0 10 )] for all k, k 0 , so that we can express vij

(6)
(7)

13

Below we will show that the model generalizes to cases where the growth rate on earnings is additive in career
and major: gjkt = gjt + gkt .
14
An alternative assumption that yields the same reduced form is that individuals are able to perfectly consumption smooth. In this case, we also can have probabilities of employment that differ by major. See Arcidiacono
(2005) for a discussion.

Utility while in College

Assuming that the payoffs from different majors depend only on expected lifetime consumption
ignores the role that the coursework in a major may have on the choice of a major. Individuals
may be selecting majors not because of the pay but because of the differences in the difficulty
of coursework across majors and their abilities to do the coursework. These abilities to do the
coursework then translate into higher expected earnings. To get at the role of difficulty of majors
and students’ abilities to complete them, we control for students’ assessments of their relative
abilities in the each of the majors, Aij , that we elicited in our survey. In particular, we model
the observed utility of the major choice while in school as uij = γj + Aij θ, so that vij becomes:
vij = γj∗ + Aij θ + α∗

K
X

Pijk ln Ŷijk10 + ηij

(10)

k=1

where γj∗ = γj + Aij θ.

4.3

Career Preferences

Finally, we allow for differences in preferences over careers themselves in some of our specifications
of our college choice model. Normalizing the preferences for the first K-1 careers relative to career
K yields the following payoff to student i for major j:
vij = γj∗ + Aij θ + α∗

k=1

Pijk δk∗ + ηij

(11)

We note that the career-specific preferences also may be picking up differences in growth rates
across majors. In particular, if we assume that major-career specific growth rates in earnings
can be written as gjk = gj + gk , then δk∗ can be decomposed into the actual preference for the
career, δk , plus a function of the difference in growth rates between career k and career K:
δk∗ = δk +

β t (gkt − gk10 − gKt + gk10 )

4.4

Estimation

Assuming that students choose their college major so as to maximize their expected utility, let
dij = 1 when j = arg maxj 0 vij 0 and zero otherwise. To simplify the estimation, we assume
that the unobserved preferences for particular majors, the ηij ’s, follow a Type I extreme value
distribution. Letting v̄ij denote vij net of ηij , the probability individual i chooses major j, pij ,
is:
exp(v̄ij )
pij = PJ
(12)
j=1 exp(v̄ij )
Given data on the choices of a major (or intended choice) by the students in our sample, the log
likelihood for the data is given by:
XX
L=
1[dij = 1] log[pij ]
(13)
i

j

where 1[ ] is the indicator function.
Similar to Zafar (2008), we also elicited more information from the students in our sample
than just their choice (or expected choice) of major. In particular, we asked them to provide
their full preference orderings over all of the majors. The details of the survey responses to this
question are given in the Appendix. These data can be used to estimate the parameters of the
alternative specifications of the payoff functions, vij , in (9), (10) and (11) via a rank-ordered,
or exploded, logit model. Let ri = (ri1 , ri2 , ..., rim , ..., riJ )0 , where rim denotes the major that
student i ranked as the mth highest of the J majors. Then it follows that the probability of
observing student i’s rankings of majors, ri , is given by:
p(ri ) ≡ P r(viri1 > viri2 > ... > viriJ ) =

J−1
Y
j=1

exp(v̄irij )

and the log likelihood for the data is:

Results

Table 9 presents estimates for the three alternative specifications of a multinomial logit model
of students’ college major choices corresponding to the major-specific payoff functions in (9),
(10) and (11), respectively. For all three specifications, we find that the coefficient on expected
log earnings ten years out, Ŷijk10 , is positive and significantly different from zero. Consistent
with Arcidiacono (2004), we also find that students’ comparative advantage in their abilities in
different majors plays a very important role in choice of a major, over and above the earnings
they expect to receive from different majors. For example, moving from a four to a five on the
self-assessed ability scale is equivalent to an 86% increase in earnings. Finally, we find much
less evidence that preferences for specific careers influence students’ choice of a major. The one
exception to this is the effect of a career in the government, which is statistically significant and
very negative in the multinomial logit estimates.

As noted in Section 4.4, we also estimated an exploded logit model for the same specifications
used in the multinomial logit model, using the data on the preference orderings over majors
elicited from students. Results for alternative specifications of the latter model are presented in
Table 14 of the Appendix. Many of the estimates for the exploded logit models are qualitative
similar to those for the multinomial logit models in Table 9. For example, the coefficients
on expected log earnings and on the ability measures have the same signs and patterns of
statistical significance as those found in Table 9. At the same time, the magnitudes of the
coefficient estimates on log earnings and the ability measures in the exploded logit models are
substantially smaller in magnitude than those for the multinomial logit models. Furthermore, the
effect of careers in government in the exploded logit model is no longer negative or statistically
significant. These differences in estimates between the two models may result from the violations
of the assumption made in both models that the errors in the payoffs to alternative majors are
independent.
Using the multinomial logit estimates from the last column of Table 9, we examine the effect
of expected log earnings and abilities on major choice. These results are presented in Table 10.
The first column of this Table displays the baseline probability of choosing each of the majors.
In the second and third columns, we use the parameter estimates to forecast choice behavior
when abilities and earnings, respectively, are the same across majors. When abilities are set
equal, large shifts occur as individuals move away from the Humanities and the Social Sciences
and into Engineering, with some movement also into the Economics major. This occurs in part
because earnings now plays a greater role in sorting and, in part, because students’ beliefs about
their ability to do well in Engineering are much lower than their beliefs about their abilities
to perform in other majors. In contrast, when earnings are set equal, the share of individuals
choosing Humanities and Social Science majors increases by 17% and 10%, respectively, with
the share choosing Economics as a major falling by 16%. The overall distribution across majors
when earnings are equal, however, still leaves no major drawing more than 20% of the students.

† Forecasts used the multinomial logit estimates from the last column in Table 9. The last three columns refer to one

standard deviation increases. The last column shows major choices when earnings for that major were increased holding
earnings in the other majors constant.

The fourth and fifth columns of Table 10 show the effects of one standard deviation increases
in the earnings of Science and Business careers, respectively. These standard deviation increases
are calculated conditional on a major. Increasing earnings in Science careers results in shifts
from all the other majors to Natural Science and Engineering majors. The share of individuals
choosing Natural Science and Engineering majors increases by 5.5% and 10%, respectively, from
a one standard deviation increase in earnings from Science careers. In contrast, a one standard
deviation increase in the earnings from Business careers leads to drops of 9.5% and 3% in the share
of Natural Science and Engineering majors. This is coupled with a 16% increase in Economics
majors. The last column of Table 10 shows the effects of a one standard deviation increase in
expected earnings for a major as a whole, holding earnings in the other majors constant. Here
the results are quite large. All majors see at least a 40% increase in the share choosing the
particular major with Humanities majors increasing by over 60%.
In Table 11, we present estimates for the alternative models separately for students who are
under-classmen (i.e., freshmen and sophomores) and those who are upper-classmen (i.e., juniors
and seniors). The corresponding exploded logit model estimates are presented in Table 15 of the
Appendix. The pattern of the coefficients is quite similar across the two groups of students. In
both the multinomial logit and exploded logit estimates, the only significant difference is that
under-classmen prefer Education careers relatively more than do upper-classmen. (Recall this
pattern was found in Table 4 for the unadjusted differences between classes in expected earnings
for different careers and majors.) Note that the coefficients on expected log earnings are not
only statistically significant for both under- and upper-classmen but they also are virtually
identical in magnitude. In his study of the choice of college majors by students at Northwestern
University, Zafar (2008) only interviewed sophomores because of a concern that asking upperclassmen about their choice of a major would raise issues of “cognitive dissonance,” given that
upper-classmen, compared to under-classmen, might be more inclined to tilt their responses
about expected outcomes in favor of the majors they had chosen. Our estimates suggest that
Zafar’s concern does not seem to apply to the expected future earnings associated with chosen
majors and their alternatives.

Forecast Errors and Choice of Major

As noted in Section 3.3, students differ in their forecasts not only because they differ in their
abilities to succeed in different majors and careers, but also because they make errors in these
forecasts. We provided some initial evidence for such errors, using data students provided about
their forecasts of earnings for common person, namely the average Duke student. In what follows,
we use the latter data, along with the model estimates presented above to address the following
hypothetical question: How would the choice of college majors change, if at all, if student
forecasts about future earnings in various majors and careers were not subject to idiosyncratic
forecast errors? In what follows, we outline our strategy for purging students’ forecasts of such
errors and then present results on the extent to which such forecast errors may affect the college
major choices of students.

6.1

Adjusting Expected Earnings for Student Forecast Errors

To characterize students’ forecast errors for their future earnings associated with the alternative
majors and careers, we proceed as follows. Let each student’s earnings premium for career k and
major j in period t, µijkt , be written as
µijkt = µjkt + ζijkt + λijk

(16)

where µjkt is the average premium in the (student) population for the various major-career
combinations, ζijkt is student i’s corresponding forecast error relative to this population average
premium and λijk denotes the student’s comparative advantage in earnings for the particular
major-career combination. We also assume that ζijkt has a median of zero. Finally, we assume
that student responses to what they would expect the earnings of the average Duke student to
AV , measures the sum of µ
be as of t = 10 for each major-career combination, Yijk10
jkt and ζijkt as
follows:
AV
= exp(µjk10 + ζijk10 )
(17)
Yijk10
It follows that an estimate of µjk10 is given by the sample median of the students’ log expectations
of the average Duke student’s earnings:15
MD
AV
µjk10 = ln Yjk10
≡ median(ln Yijk10
)

(18)

Then it follows that we can purge students’ expectations about their own earnings in different
majors and careers of their forecast errors, ζijk10 , as follows:
∗
Yijk10
=

MD)
Ŷijk10 exp(ln Yjk10
AV
Yijk10

(19)

∗
where Yijk10
denotes student i’s adjusted earnings for major j and career k as of t = 10.
15

We allow the estimates of µjk10 to vary by whether the individual is an upperclassmen or not due to the
timing of the survey being during the financial crisis and this possibly affecting cohorts differently. However, the
estimates of switching behavior are similar when we restrict the premiums to be the same across the two groups.

20

6.2

Choices without Forecast Errors

We use the estimation results presented in Table 9 to examine how the students’ choice of majors
would have changed if their forecasts of the premiums for different major-career combinations
had been purged of forecast errors, using the strategy outlined in the preceding section. To do
this, we return to the model, focusing in particular on the case where we control for major-specific
abilities and career preferences. In this case, student i chooses major j1 when:
j1 = arg max γj + Aij θ + α

∗

j

K
X

Pijk ln Ŷijk10 +

k=1

K−1
X

Pijk δk + ηij

(20)

k=1

We can use this decision rule to generate η’s consistent with their choice behavior. Once we
have this set of η’s we can then see how often decisions would change if we purged expected log
earnings of measurement error. We first draw one hundred sets of η’s for each individual such
that their choice of major is consistent with the decision rule in (20). Consider an individual
who chooses j1 . This individual would have chosen a different major when the combination of
how expected earnings changed due to removing forecast error and the draw on the η’s is such
that it is no longer optimal to choose major j1 :
j1 6= arg max γj + Aij θ + α
j

∗

K
X

∗
Pijk ln Yijk10

k=1

+

K−1
X

Pijk δk + ηij

k=1

We average over the implied switching behavior across individuals and draws on the η’s for
their initial choice. Average switching behavior is reported in the first row of Table 12. The
average probability of switching due to the removal of the forecast error was a little over seven
and a half percent. At a little over four percent, switch rates were significantly lower for the
40% of the sample who ranked themselves at the top of the self assessment scale in their major
(Aij = 5). For those who did not self report their ability as the highest category for their major,
switch rates were much higher at ten percent. This latter group is more likely to be on the
margin of switching majors and also may have chosen majors on the basis of bad information
regarding their labor market prospects. We distinguish between these possibilities next.
To investigate how forecast errors may be affecting college major decisions we calculate the
fraction of positive forecast errors both in and out of one’s own major. The overall rate is
above fifty percent. Since at the major-career level the rate would be at exactly fifty percent,
this suggests forecast error is affecting the probabilities individuals will end up in particular
careers. Namely, if individuals erroneously believe premiums are high in a particular career,
they associate higher probabilities of being in the career. This suggests, in contrast to what we
have estimated, that choice of career is endogenous even after controlling for major.16
The third and fourth rows of Table 12 suggest that individuals are more likely to have upwardbiased estimates of earnings in their own major. This makes sense in a model where individuals
are making their major decisions based upon signals of market rewards for particular majorcareer combinations. The forecast errors are actually smaller for those who report lower abilities
in their major. Hence, the higher switching behavior observed for those with lower within-major
ability occurs because these individuals are at the margin of switching, not because of higher
16

In future work, we hope to model this endogeneity explicitly.

because they were at the margin, invested more time in finding out the true market premiums
when making their decisions.

Conclusion

The choice of college major plays a critical role in determining the future earnings of college
graduates. Economic models of educational choices suggest that students’ college major decisions
would be guided, in part, by the future earnings streams associated with the different majors.
To examine the potential role of future expected earnings on these choices, we asked a sample
of college students about their subjective expectations on the probabilities of entering different
careers and the earnings associated with different careers conditional on both their own major,
as well as conditional on majors they did not choose, their counterfactual expectations.
The descriptive statistics and model estimates reveal that sorting occurs, both on expected
earnings and on individual perceptions of their relative abilities to perform the coursework in
particular majors. Our estimates imply that equalizing abilities would lead to a substantial
increase in the number of students majoring in Economics and a drop in the number majoring
in Humanities. In contrast, if we equalize expected earnings across majors, our estimates imply
a sizeable increase in the number of students majoring in the Humanities.
Students also were asked to make forecasts about what the average student at Duke would
make in particular careers. We found that students are more likely to enter careers where they
expected the average Duke student to earn more than what the average student in the sample
expected. We also use the data from this latter set of forecasts to purge students’ forecasts about
their own earnings prospects in different majors and careers and how their choices of a college
major would differ from the choices of majors that they actually made. Our results indicate that
correcting for these forecast errors with the estimates from our model of college major choice
would lead to 7.5% of the students in our sample switching their majors.
The approach and findings of this paper about college major choice illustrates the potential
for using counterfactual expectations in choice models. Furthermore, following the strategy used
in this paper to elicit student probabilities of being in (or choosing) particular careers, represents
a potentially useful alternative to relying solely on data on observed discrete choices and earnings
to estimate conditional choice probabilities (CCP), the fundamental building block of structural

22

dynamic discrete choice models.17 In future work, we plan to conduct a panel study to see how
individuals update their expectations over time. Updating would occur on their abilities to do
the coursework, the expected earnings in the various careers, and their preferences over working
in different careers.

Appendix

In the survey, we also elicited from all students their preference orderings over all majors. These
orderings provide us with additional information with which to analyze how students determined
their choice of major. We first examine the proportion of students who ranked their own major
as most preferred. These results are given in Table 13. Here we see that, while there is clearly
a strong positive correlation, many students do not rank their own major first. This suggests
that some individuals are answering this question based upon what they enjoy outside of labor
market considerations. This is confirmed in the next two tables where we estimate exploded
logit models of major choice. While the income measures are still significant, they are about
half the magnitude of the estimates when actual major choice is used.
