In these models, business cycles are driven by productivity changes resulting either from technology shocks or from crucial building blocks that give both types of models hope of fitting the data. These building blocks include durability of goods, specialized labor, imperfect credit and elastic labor supply. We also present new evidence on co-movement of both outputs sand labor inputs across sectors and on the increasing returns model is easier to reconcile with the data than the real business cycle model.\n\n",
