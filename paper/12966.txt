Child Mortality, Income and Adult Height

ABSTRACT
We investigate the childhood determinants of adult height in populations, focusing on the respective
roles of income and of disease. We develop a model of selection and scarring, in which the early life
burden of nutrition and disease is not only responsible for mortality in childhood but also leaves a
residue of long-term health risks for survivors, risks that express themselves in adult height, as well
as in late-life disease. Across a range of European countries and the United States, we find a strong
inverse relationship between postneonatal (one month to one year) mortality, interpreted as a measure
of the disease and nutritional burden in childhood, and the mean height of those children as adults.
In pooled birth-cohort data over 30 years for the United States and eleven European countries, postneonatal
mortality in the year of birth accounts for more than 60 percent of the combined cross-country and
cross-cohort variation in adult heights. The estimated effects are smaller but remain significant once
we allow for country and birth-cohort effects. In the poorest and highest mortality countries of the
world, there is evidence that child mortality is positively associated with adult height. That selection
should dominate scarring at high mortality levels, and scarring dominate selection at low mortality
levels, is consistent with the model for reasonable values of its parameters.

1. Introduction
This paper is concerned with the relationship between net nutrition in childhood and
subsequent adult height, the latter interpreted as a measure of life-time health and which,
in turn, predicts late-life morbidity and mortality. Net nutrition is gross nutrition from
food, less nutritional losses to disease. Health policy can be directed at one or both of
these, with income often seen as the instrument for gross nutrition, and public health and
medicine, through such measures as sanitation and immunization (public health), or oral
rehydration (medicine), as instruments against disease. Where to place the main focus is a
key question for policymakers in poor countries today.
We look at the relationship between childhood disease, income, and adult height
within a theoretical framework that emphasizes the countervailing forces of scarring and
selection. Disease and deprivation in infancy generate health and height selective
mortality, but they also “scar” the survivors whose health and height are lower than
would otherwise have been the case. Our primary focus is on birth cohorts born between
1950 and 1980 in eleven European countries and the United States. In accord with the
dominance of scarring over selection, we find a strong negative relationship between
adult height and the disease burden in the first year of life, measured by postneonatal
mortality, particularly postneonatal mortality from respiratory disease. Variations in
postneonatal mortality account for more than sixty percent of the pooled cross-country
and time-series variation in adult heights. Although the size of the effect is about half as
big based on within-country estimation as it is when we combine cross and within
country variation, it remains statistically significant and is so even in the presence of both
year and country effects. Conditional on the disease burden, we find no role for income.

1

These results are broadly consistent with our model of selection and scarring. Even
so, mortality rates in rich countries since 1950 are too low to allow exploration of our
theoretical prediction that selection effects will be relatively stronger at high levels of
child mortality. When we add data on heights from forty-three poor countries, we do
indeed find such evidence, with some suggestion that, at very high levels of mortality,
selection may dominate scarring, at which point further increases in mortality will result
in increased adult heights in the surviving population. These results need to be
interpreted with some caution given the much weaker data for the poor countries, as well
as the large fraction of the cross-country variation in heights that is unexplained by
mortality rates. Indeed, both income and disease play a role in high-mortality countries,
and there are large unexplained differences between regions—with Africans taller, and
South Asians shorter than would be expected—as well as remarkable variations across
countries within continents, particularly within Africa and Latin America.
The paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 reviews the background literature and
motivation for the analysis. Section 3 presents a model of childhood disease and its
effects on adult height. It allows us to think about the long term effects of disease, and
allows for long run damage and possible immunity effects, as well as the effects of
selection on population health. Section 4 discusses our European and American data and
presents preliminary graphical evidence. Section 5 presents our main regression results.
Section 6 contains the comparative results from developing countries. Section 7
concludes.

2. Background
Height is of considerable interest to both economists and biologists. It is a direct and
readily available measure of long-run, life-course health, and is an indicator of wellbeing
in its own right. Economic historians have long used mean height as a supplementary
measure of population living standards; height often, but not always, tracks measures of
average wages or GDP per head, Floud, Wachter, and Gregory (1990), Steckel (1995).
Skeletal remains have been used to provide estimates of living standards in the distant
past, sometimes suggesting that the historical progress of living standards has been less
unidirectional than is often thought, Steckel (2004). At the individual level, taller people
earn more in both rich and poor countries, they are better educated, they are more likely
to belong to non-manual occupations and to higher social classes, and they have lower
mortality rates even controlling for other risk factors, Waaler (1984), Jousilhati,
Tuomilehto, Vartiainen, Eriksson, and Puska (2000). Case and Paxson (2006) argue that
height is a marker for cognitive development, and that the (on average) superior cognitive
development of taller individuals may account for their superior outcomes in the labor
market. Fogel (2004) has argued that for much of human history, the availability of
calories constrained human growth, and it was the agricultural revolution, starting in
Britain in the middle of the 18th Century, that set off a cumulative synergistic process in
which both heights and output per head increased, enough to account for most of the
increase in both economic living standards and in life expectancy over the last two
hundred and fifty years.
The literature on human growth argues that an individual’s stature is determined early
in life, by age two or three; see Silventoinen (2003) for a review of the respective roles of

3

genetics, disease, and standards of living. The correlation of child’s height with ultimate
height, which is between 0.25 and 0.3 at birth, rises to between 0.7 and 0.8 at age two,
and increases only slowly thereafter, Schmidt, Jorgensen, and Michaelsen (1995). Since
nutrients are required for physical development, the simplest version of the story is that
final height is a marker of the availability of nutrition in the first two years of life. But
nutrition in this context means not just food intake, or gross nutrition, but the nutrition
actually absorbed, or net nutrition. Net nutrition is determined not only by food
availability, but by losses to diseases, most obviously diarrheal disease. Children who
constantly suffer from diarrhea because they drink contaminated water are unlikely to be
well-nourished, irrespective of the food available to them. It is therefore possible to tell a
story of historical mortality decline that focuses as much on disease and public health as
on the availability of food. In modern developing countries, a focus on childhood disease
has quite different policy implications than a focus on economic growth, which is
presumably the surest way to improve gross nutrition.
There is a large literature that links childhood disease to adult outcomes, including
adult height as well as late-life disease and mortality. As early as Kermack, McKendrick,
and McKinlay (1934), researchers have repeatedly found strong birth-cohort effects in
lifetime mortality patterns, at least before recent years when smoking, antibiotics, and
successful medical interventions have added important period effects. These results
suggest that early life experiences have long-lasting effects on health, with the lifetime
pattern of mortality set in the first few years of life. The long reach of net nutrition in
utero and in early childhood, observable throughout life in childhood growth and adult
height, is one possible mechanism that has been extensively studied following the

4

influential work of Barker, see Barker, Osmond, and Golding (1990) and Barker (1994).
Others include infections that are acquired in childhood, and carried through life, such as
respiratory tuberculosis, or, as has been argued by some, infections that predispose
towards heart disease, see Elo and Preston (1992) and Costa (2000) for reviews.
Finch and Crimmins (2004) and Crimmins and Finch (2006) argue that a wide range
of childhood infectious diseases lead to inflammatory responses, which are well adapted
for short term survival, but which divert energy from growth and diminish adult stature,
and which beyond that, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in late life. If this
hypothesis is correct, the links between late life mortality and adult stature, on the one
hand, and childhood disease on the other, may go well beyond the obvious mechanism
from net nutrition to height to mortality, and extend to a much wider range of childhood
diseases. These are likely to include respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, that still
exert a heavy toll among children in developing countries, where they kill nearly four
million children each year, World Health Organization (2003). Such general effects of
infectious disease on long-term health also strengthen the argument for collective action
on traditional public health measures, as well as better delivery of antibiotics, and weaken
the argument for relying on economic growth.
Crimmins and Finch, in addition to documenting the links between childhood
infectious disease and old-age mortality in several European countries, use long-run
nineteenth century data from France and Sweden to confirm a relationship between mean
adult height (at age 20-21) for a birth cohort and its infant mortality rate, the latter
interpreted as an indicator of the general disease environment in childhood. Their work
complements that on modern data by Schmidt, Jorgensen, and Michaelsen (1995) who

5

document a relationship between the average height of 18-year old conscripts in eleven
European countries and postneonatal (from 28 days to one year) mortality (PNM) in the
year of their births. PNM is a better indicator of the disease environment than is infant
mortality, because the latter includes neonatal mortality (mortality from birth to age of 28
days) changes in which reflect improvements in pre- and perinatal care rather than
improvements of nutrition and prevalence of infections during infancy, Schmidt,
Jorgensen, and Michaelsen, (1995). In Europe PNM has been declining in all countries,
leveling out at different dates once a common low level has been achieved. Schmidt,
Jorgensen, and Michaelsen document an inverse but matching pattern in conscript
heights, with heights leveling off in the countries whose PNM reached low levels first,
and with cross country height differences mirroring cross-country differences in PNM
eighteen years before.

3. Childhood disease and adult height: a theoretical framework
Suppose that each child is born with some physiological characteristic hi . This
characteristic, which we might as well think of as (potential) adult height, is distributed in
the population with distribution function F (h). Newborn children with height less than a
cutoff z cannot survive, so that the baseline infant mortality rate, which we can think of as
mortality from factors (such as genetic abnormalities) that operate up to and including
birth, is F ( z ).
Into this baseline situation, we introduce an environmental disease or nutritional
burden that varies from year to year. Write this as vt , with larger values indicating
heavier disease burden. We think of these as epidemics of childhood disease, smallpox

6

and whooping cough in the 17th and 18th centuries, measles and scarlet fever in the early
to mid-20th century. They could also cover nutritional deficiencies, whether through
famine-induced lack of food, or through infectious disease reducing nutritional intake.
The disease burden is assumed to reduce the endowed physiological characteristic,
increasing the infant mortality rate. In the empirical work, postneonatal mortality is our
best indicator of this burden, but for the theoretical development, we draw no distinction.
Children die if the reduced characteristic is less than z, if
hi − vt ≤ z

(1)

so that the mortality rate, taking account the disease burden, is now given by
mt = F ( z + vt )

(2)

which varies from year to year. If we knew the distribution and the value of z, we could
recover the disease burden from knowledge of the infant mortality rate using

vt = F −1 (mt ) − z

(3)

In this sense, infant mortality is an indicator of the burden of disease, which justifies its
frequent treatment as such in the literature. Note that z is measured in the same units as h,
and in the empirical results below, will typically be presented as a “z-score,” the number
of standard deviations below the mean at which survival becomes impossible.
We need to add long-term effects or “scarring” to this story. Those who survive the
epidemic are assumed to pay some permanent price in their long-term health. For
example, this scarring might come from an infection acquired in childhood that is carried
through the rest of life; respiratory tuberculosis, or helicobacter pylorii, would be
examples from the time before there was effective chemical prophylaxis. Acute
rheumatic fever in childhood might predispose to rheumatic heart disease in old age. This

7

scarring might affect adult mortality, or in the analysis here, adult height. We assume that
some fraction θ of v t is permanently deducted from their physiological parameter.
Hence, for the survivors,
h%it = hi − θ vt

(4)

We shall typically assume that θ is positive, because that appears to conform to the
empirical evidence, but if the encounter with the disease confers some sort of lifetime
immunity, as in the case of smallpox, for example, θ could be negative. The size of θ ,
which has the dimension of a pure number, measures the extent to which the forces that
shift down the health endowment, and which lead to infant mortality, persist into final
adult height. If the effects of early damage are permanent, θ will be unity; with some
transitory effect or some recovery, it will be less.
Given the adult height of the survivors from equation (4), the average adult height of
the survivors of the cohort born in t is given by

ht

∫
=

∞

z + vt

hdF (h)

1 − F ( z + vt )

− θ vt

(5)

The first term is increasing in the burden of disease vt ; childhood disease selects out the
shorter people, leaving people who are on average taller, and taller by more the greater
the severity of the disease. The second term, which is negative if θ is positive, is the
scarring effect of the disease. If θ is negative, so that the childhood disease encounter
confers immunity, the second term will reinforce the positive selection in the first term.
We also note that (5) is likely to be useful for consideration of the effects of
childhood disease on other late-life events, such as the susceptibility to cardiovascular
disease. Each such event would be characterized by selection and scarring effects but

8

with its own parameter θ . As a result, height will be (imperfectly) correlated with latelife health.
The effects of vt on cohort height can be assessed by differentiating (5), which can be
written as
∂ht
f ( z + vt )
= ( h − z − (1 − θ )vt )
−θ
∂vt
1 − F ( z + vt )

(6)

Since height has to be larger than z + vt in order to survive, the shortest survivor has
adult height z + vt − θ vt , so that the first term on the right hand side of (6) is positive. This
is the effect of childhood mortality selecting out the infants and children who have the
lowest potential adult height. Depending on the values of the parameters, and the size of
the burden vt , the net effect can go in either direction, and the derivative in (6) can
change sign over the range of vt .
Given that the shock vt is not observable, but that the mortality rate is, it is useful to
combine (3) and (5) so as to link the average height of the survivors to the mortality rate
of the birth cohort. This yields
∞

ht =

∫

hdF (h)

F −1 ( mt )

1 − mt

− θ ( F −1 (mt ) − z )

(7)

Equation (7) is more straightforward to handle if we assume that the (untruncated) original
distribution of heights is normal with mean μ and variance σ 2 . Substituting into (7) and
performing the integration, we obtain
ht − μ

⎡
− θ ⎢Φ −1 (mt ) −

⎣

(8)

where φ and Φ are the standard normal density and distribution functions, respectively.
Equation (8) provides a relationship for the “z-score” of height (in relation to the standard that
would prevail in the absence of mortality) in terms of the mortality rate, the survival cutoff
(expressed in standard deviations from the mean), and the scarring parameter θ .
Figure 1 shows plots of average height from (8) against the mortality rate for a range
of values of θ . We have assumed a value of z that is 2.5 standard deviations below the
mean, so that the baseline mortality rate (when vt is zero) is only 0.6 percent. Each graph
therefore starts from a value of 6 for the mortality rate, with the resulting mild selection
giving an average height of 1.8 percent of a standard deviation above the unselected
mean. In these graphs, higher mortality is associated with higher height when scarring is
unimportant (low θ ) and with lower height when scarring is important (high θ ). As the
figure shows, for intermediate values of θ , the graph is non-monotonic in mortality, with
scarring effects predominating at low mortality, and selection effects predominating at
high mortality. The figure also shows that, at low mortality levels, scarring effects can
make average heights extremely sensitive to changes in mortality patterns and even if
there is no reversal, the scarring effects are gradually attenuated by selection as mortality
rises. In Section 6 below, we shall examine the extent to which the worldwide
distribution of heights matches Figure 1.

4. Data description
4.1. Height data

For ten European countries, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal, Spain, and Sweden, height data were extracted from Garcia and Quintana-

10

Domeque (2006) who compute average heights using data from the European
Community Household Panel (ECHP). The ECHP is a standardized annual longitudinal
survey designed and coordinated by the European Commission’s Statistical Office
(EUROSTAT), which involves annual interviewing of individuals aged 16 and older
from a representative panel of households (Peracchi, 2002).
Heights for the United States come from the National Health Interview Surveys
(NHIS) for the years 1996, and 1998-2004. This NHIS is a series of cross-sections with
no panel element. As in the European data, heights are self-reported. Height data for
England are taken from the nationally representative Health Survey for England (HSE)
for the years 1992-1999; unlike the other surveys, heights were measured by nurses,
rather than self-reported. All calculations (except for Sweden, where the requisite data are
unavailable, see Garcia and Quintana-Domeque, 2006) exclude those born outside of the
country.
For the US and England, we compute average adult heights for each birth cohort from
1950 to 1980; for the rest of European countries average adult cohorts heights are taken
from Garcia and Quintana-Domeque (2006). We exclude birth-cohorts born after 1980 in
order to restrict ourselves to individuals who have fully attained their adult heights. In the
ECHP data, the number of reported heights in the average varies from a low of 50 Danes
in the birth-cohort of 1980 to a high of 1,358 Italians in the birth cohort of 1972; the
effective sample sizes are substantially smaller because of the panel structure, with most
individuals appearing three or four times, Garcia and Quintana-Domeque. For the English
data, the average number of observations per cohort is 1,345, but the sample size for
people born between 1975 and 1978 is small (218 per cohort, on average). In the US,

11

heights are averaged irrespective of race or ethnicity; the number of observations ranges
from 4,667 for the 1961 cohort to 1,535 for the 1980 cohort. In all cases, we take men
and women together; in order to avoid effects of the sex composition of the population
we calculate average height as half the average height of men plus half the height average
height of women. While it is not necessarily the case that the degree of sexual
dimorphism is the same across countries, or is unaffected by environmental conditions in
early life, this is not the topic of our analysis here, and we pool the data so as to obtain
maximal precision on average heights by country and birth cohort.
Our height measures have both strengths and weaknesses compared with others in the
literature. One strength is that the ECHP, NIHS, and HSE all provide nationally
representative data, so that we are not limited to males or to male military conscripts. One
weakness is that by identifying birth cohorts by age at (what is effectively) a single point
of time, we are ignoring the effects of mortality on cohort height between the ages of 21
and 51, as well as any effects of health-selective emigration on the height of the resident
cohort. We are also working with self-reported data, except for England. Comparisons of
self-reported and directly measured heights in the United States, using the National
Health Interview Survey (self-reported) and the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (directly measured), show that self-reported heights exaggerate
measured height on average, and that the difference, which is greater for males than
females up to age 70, increases with age, Thomas and Frankenberg (2002, Figure 1),
Ezzati et al. (2006, Figure 2). However, these results also show little age-variation in the
bias between 20 to 50, which may reasonably be interpolated to the European surveys;

12

even so, the directly measured English heights are likely to be somewhat understated
relative to those from the other countries
4.2. GDP and mortality data

GDP data are taken from version 6.2 of the Penn World Table, Heston, Summers, and
Aten (2006); we use the real (chained) value of GDP per capita in constant year-2000
purchasing power dollars. Although our height data are for England, we use GDP
estimates for the United Kingdom: the inclusion of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland
in one set of estimates but not the other is unlikely to compromise our results.
Postneonatal and neonatal mortality rates are taken from the 1953–1964 editions of the
Annual Epidemiological and Vital Statistics (Part I: Vital Statistics and Causes of Deaths,
WHO, Geneva) and from the 1965–1982 editions of the World Health Statistics Annual
(Vol. I: Vital Statistics and Causes of Deaths, WHO, Geneva), supplemented where
necessary by data from the electronic WHO mortality database (WHO, Department of
Measurement and Health Information Systems Epidemiology and Burden of Disease,
January 31, 2004). There is a substantial number of missing values, see Appendices A2
and A3 for a full description.
4.3 Main features of the data

Table 1 summarizes the height data. Although we shall use year-by-year observations in
the analysis in the next section, there is substantial estimation uncertainty which induces
year to year variation, so here we present five year averages (or six years for the birth
cohorts 1950 to 1955.) Note again that we pool men and women; men are 10 to 11
centimeters taller than women on average. Males have higher postneonatal mortality (and

13

mortality generally) than do females, but we do not want to argue that this difference is in
any way related to the height differences between men and women as adults.
The table shows that Denmark and Sweden are the two tallest countries, with Spain
and Portugal the shortest. The inhabitants of richer countries are taller than the
inhabitants of poorer countries, and Figure 2 shows the remarkably close correlation.
Such findings are clearly consistent with (among other hypotheses) an important role for
early life nutrition in adult height, and with greater availability of food in better-off
countries. Table 1 also shows that, in the poorer, or more southerly, countries of Europe,
height has been increasing across the birth cohorts from 1950 through to 1980, while in
the richer and more northerly countries, height has either stagnated or increased for the
earlier birth cohorts, and leveled off later. Figure 3 shows this pattern more clearly. The
lower curve shows the average height by birth cohort for Greece, Italy, Portugal and
Spain (each given equal weight), while the higher curve shows the unweighted average
over the other eight countries. (The picture looks essentially the same if Ireland is moved
to the lower group.)
Table 2 shows the five-year averaged data for postneonatal mortality (PNM) for those
countries and periods where we have been able to locate the data. In 1950-55, PNM
varied from 61 per 1,000 live births in Portugal to 5 per 1,000 live births in Sweden. It
has fallen in all countries since then, to 11 in Portugal in 1976-80, and 2 in Sweden, a
value that had also been attained by Finland, with Denmark not far behind. A rate of 2
deaths per thousand is presumably close to the minimum attainable. Already in 1950, the
Swedes were close to this figure, while Portugal, Spain, Italy, and (presumably) Greece,
still had a long way to go. Figure 4 shows the annual pattern of PNM averaged over the

14

same groups of countries as for heights in Figure 3, and shows its mirror image. Adults in
the countries with high PNM were relatively short on average, and as their PNM rate fell,
children born in the years of lower PNM were taller as adults. In the richer countries,
with lower PNM to start and smaller improvements to make, heights were taller to start
but did not grow over time. In the next section, we explore whether this timing matches
on a country by country basis, and whether it survives competition with other
explanations.
If Figure 2 is redrawn for neonatal mortality (NNM) in place of postneonatal
mortality as shown in Figure 5, the two lines are much less far apart in the early years,
and fall in parallel. There has been a great deal of progress in reducing NNM, for
example through the use of neonatal intensive care units that help the survival of low
birthweight babies, and this progress had shown no signs of slowing by 1980. PNM by
contrast, is driven less by technological improvements, than by improving the disease
environment and the ready availability of hospital care, something that had already been
largely accomplished in the richer countries by the early 1950s.

5. Analysis of European and American heights

Table 3 presents a series of regressions in which height is the dependent variable.
Column 1 shows that in the 316 pooled time-series cross-section observations for the 12
countries over 31 years of birth, variation in postneonatal mortality explains 62 percent of
the variation in average heights. The parameter estimate is –0.16, so that a reduction in
PNM by 20 per thousand, which is a modest improvement by historical standards, will
increase average heights by 3.2 centimeters, which is more than most of the actual

15

increases shown in Table 1. The estimate is so high because we are forcing PNM to
account for the time-series and cross-section simultaneously, and the inclusion of country
fixed effects in column (2) cuts the estimated effect by a third to –0.10, which provides a
closer match to the within-country time-series increases in height relative to the
reductions in PNM. The inclusion of a time trend in column (3), with a secular increase in
heights in all countries of a twentieth of a centimeter per year, or 1.5 centimeters over the
thirty year period, reduces the estimated effect of PNM by a further third, to –0.06. This
is likely too low, because some of the effect assigned to the time trend is presumably due
to the secular reduction in PNM. Column (4) includes, in addition to the country fixed
effects, a set of year fixed effects. This adds little to the explained variance over the time
trend in column (3), and does not further change the size or significance of the estimated
effect of PNM on heights.
Column (4) shows that the preliminary findings of Figures 3 and 4 carry through to a
more thorough country-based analysis. By allowing for both year effects and country
effects, the fact that PNM still exerts a significant negative effect on heights shows that
the correlation is not simply a matter of common trends, one falling everywhere, and one
rising everywhere. More than that, the cross-country patterns of the timing of the fall and
stabilization of postneonatal mortality match (inversely) the cross-country patterns of the
timing of the rise and stabilization of heights.
The right-hand panel of Table 3 looks at what happens when we introduce two other
possible determinants of height, real income per head (measured by the log of real per
capita GDP PPP), and neonatal mortality (NNM), both in the year of birth. Otherwise, we
follow the same procedure as in the left-hand side of the table, sequentially introducing

16

country effects, a time (year of birth) trend, and a set of time effects. Column (8) shows
that column (4) is essentially unaffected by the introduction of income and NNM. In the
pooled time-series and cross-section, neither (the logarithm of) per capita GDP nor NNM
are significantly different from zero, and neither the size nor the significance of PNM is
much affected. For real GDP per capita, the insignificance persists in all specifications
that contain country fixed effects, although in column (5), it plays a role in explaining
cross-country variation in heights. Across columns (5) through (8), the size of the
estimated coefficient is unstable from one specification to another. In columns (6) and
(7), neonatal mortality attracts a significant coefficient, and it is possible that it, along
with PNM, is linked to adult heights.
We now turn to the causes of PNM. It is not possible to do this in a comprehensive
way, but at the price of reducing the number of data points to 297, we can split PNM into
four components, mortality from pneumonia, mortality from intestinal disease, mortality
from congenital anomalies, and mortality from other causes; Appendix A1 provides the
definitions of each category. We also note that, if only because of uncertainty over
diagnosis, information on cause of death is always likely to be less precise than the
mortality data themselves. The large differences between high PNM and low PNM
countries, for example Portugal and Italy on the one hand, and Sweden and the US on the
other, lie in mortality from intestinal disease, followed by mortality from pneumonia. The
Swedish postneonatal mortality rate from intestinal disease has been zero (or at least less
than 0.5 per 1,000) since 1972. There are also substantial differences in the “other”
category, but the differences in mortality rates from congenital abnormalities are small.
Over time and within countries, all categories of PNM have fallen, with mortality from

17

congenital abnormalities falling the least, and mortality from pneumonia and intestinal
disease falling the most rapidly, and in about equal measure from about 8 and 6 per
thousand for the birth cohort of 1950 to 0.4 and 0.2 respectively for the birth cohort of
1980.
Table 4 repeats the sequence of regressions in Table 3, but with postneonatal
mortality split into its four components. The most important result in the table is that
PNM from pneumonia in infancy is a consistently significant predictor of adult height
across all of the specifications, with the size of the estimated effect varying according to
the specification in very much the same way as did the estimated effect of overall PNM
in Table 3. In the regressions without country effects, PNM from intestinal disease is also
significant—it is the component that varies most across countries—but its effect is less
than a quarter of that of PNM from pneumonia, and it fades into insignificance once
country dummies are included. Mortality from congenital diseases has a significant effect
on adult height in the regressions with country dummies and no time effects or only a
time trend. The penultimate row of the table shows that the estimated effects of PNM
from different causes are statistically different, at least in the more parsimoniously
parametrized models. Otherwise, the results in Table 4 are similar to those in Table 3,
albeit with reduced statistical significance reflecting the smaller sample size and the fact
that all of the components of PNM share downward trends, so that these regressions are
pushing our data close to the limit of the information that they contain.
The finding that it is childhood respiratory disease that predicts adult height more
strongly than childhood intestinal disease is somewhat surprising given the direct and
obvious effects of intestinal disease on net nutrition. Even so, that pneumonia should

18

stunt growth is predicted by the work of Crimmins and Finch discussed in the
background section, and our finding is supportive of their ideas. It also suggests a further
refocusing of attention towards the effects of childhood disease on adult health and away
from food and its retention.

6. Selection versus scarring

The European and American results can be directly interpreted in terms of the model of
selection and scarring in Section 3. In particular, if we maintain the assumption that the
underlying distribution of potential heights is normal, we can use equation (8). We
assume that, in the absence of infant mortality, adult heights would have a mean of 176
centimeters, and a standard deviation of 6.0, which were the actual figures for Denmark
for the cohorts born between 1976 and 1980. Given this, and given that the first term on
the right-hand side is parameter free and so can be subtracted from the normalized mean
height on the left-hand side, we can estimate the parameters θ and z by estimating (8) by
linear regression. We therefore use data on ht and mt to estimate the equation
ht − μ

σ

−

φ[Φ −1 (mt )]
1 − mt

⎡z−μ⎤
=θ ⎢
− θ Φ −1 (mt )
⎥
⎣ σ ⎦

(9)

so that the parameter θ is recovered as the coefficient on Φ −1 (mt ) and the z-score ( z − μ ) / σ or
z itself from the estimated constant term given the estimate of θ .

The scarring parameter θ is estimated to be 1.18, and the disease-free cutoff for
mortality is 3.12 standard deviations below the untruncated mean. A value of θ near one
implies that the disease- or famine-based shift in potential heights in childhood persists
unmodified into adulthood. Although some later magnification of the childhood effect

19

seems theoretically possible, we expect θ to be less than the full persistence value. If we
follow the general scheme of Table 3, and add in country fixed effects, the estimate of the
scarring parameter falls to 0.77, and the cutoff is 3.16 standard deviations below the
mean. With a time-trend, we get 0.64 and 3.42, and these values change little if we allow
year effects. As was the case for the regressions in Table 3, the time trend (or year
effects) almost certainly absorbs some of the effect of mortality decline, causing the
scarring effect to be underestimated. The fits of these equations are only slightly inferior
to those obtained by adding a quadratic in PNM to the original regressions. When the
logarithm of real income is added, it is insignificantly different from zero in the absence
of country fixed effects, though it becomes significant in their presence, essentially
because within-country year to year fluctuations in income are correlated with withincountry variations in cohort heights.
Given the skeletal nature of the scarring and selection model, we view these results as
supportive of its predictions. However, there is a limited range of mortality variation in
Europe and North America after 1950, and the curvature of the relationship between adult
height and postneonatal mortality rests heavily on the experience of the highest mortality
countries, particularly Portugal. To investigate the model further, we turn to a different
source of data with a much wider range of mortality experience.
The new information on heights is from women who were measured in the
international system of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). These surveys, whose
main subject is reproductive and child health, have measured the heights of women aged
15 through 49 in more than 40 countries since the late 1990s. The countries that we use
are listed in Appendix A3; there are 27 in Africa, 8 in Latin America and the Caribbean,

20

3 (India, Bangladesh, and Nepal) in South Asia, and 5 in Central Asia (which we group
with the Egyptian and Moroccan surveys from Africa to form a Middle East and North
African region.) As is to be expected, other data availability for these countries is not as
good as in Europe and the United States. Although we have annual data on income per
capita in PPP terms from the Penn World Table which can be matched to the adult height
of each birth cohort in most of the surveys, we do not have any consistent international
data on postneonatal mortality and, indeed, for many of these countries, such data do not
exist. Instead, we turn to the infant mortality rates provided by the United Nations
population division which are available for five year intervals after 1950. (Childhood
mortality, up to age 5, is often more accurately measured than infant mortality rates
because of uncertainty about birth dates, but is not available from the UN, and World
Bank data begin only in 1960.) We also note that, compared with the rich countries of
Europe and North America, the poor countries have much greater mortality between
infancy and adulthood, when heights are measured, something that is not taken into
account in the model.
The switch from postneonatal to infant mortality, and the move from rich to poor
countries changes the way in which we need to think about the effects of income and
disease on mortality rates, as well as on adult heights. For the rich countries after 1950,
postneonatal mortality was largely a reflection of the disease environment, not of gross
nutritional adequacy in terms of food intake, which was unlikely to have been a limiting
factor. Infant mortality includes both neonatal and postneonatal mortality, and in poor
countries in Africa and South Asia, it is almost certainly affected by the availability of
food, as well as by disease, as well as by interactions between them, Scrimshaw, Taylor,

21

and Gordon (1968). Food inadequacy makes children more likely to succumb to at least
some infections, and the growth inhibition from the infection will be made up later only if
there is adequate nourishment. Hence, and unlike the case in the rich countries, infant
mortality rates capture the effects both of disease and of food inadequacy (or low
income), while food inadequacy itself is likely to affect adult height even conditional on
infant or childhood mortality.
Figure 6 shows a plot of women’s heights against the infant mortality rate (pooling
the DHS with the European and North American data); there are 288 observations across
countries and five year periods. Each point is the mean of women’s height in a five-year
birth cohort versus the infant mortality rate for the same period; we use data only on
women aged 20 or older because women in poor countries sometimes attain adult height
at later ages than in rich countries. (Indeed, age 20 is too young for South Asia, but an
older cutoff would eliminate many otherwise valid data points.) Imposed on the
scatterplot, we show two lines. The broken line is a non-parametric regression fit, which
shows height declining with infant mortality in the year of birth throughout most of the
range, but with an upturn beginning at levels of infant mortality above 150 per thousand.
The solid line shows the fitted values of the selection and scarring model, again using the
Danish standard, and with fitted estimates for θ and z of 1.38 and 3.59 standard
deviations below the mean, respectively. This value of θ is too high to give nonmonotonicity, even at high values of infant mortality, but it otherwise provides a
reasonable fit to the general pattern of the data.
As was the case for Europe and the US, the fit is improved and the estimate of θ
reduced (to 0.66) if we include dummies for five regions of the world (Europe/US,

22

Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, and subSaharan Africa). The regional dummies are important, and given the infant mortality
levels in their year of birth, women in Latin America and in South Asia are shorter and
women in sub-Saharan Africa taller than would be expected. This is the adult version of
the child malnutrition–child mortality puzzle previously noted by Klasen (2006). Within
the model, the regional effects are interpretable as regional differences in potential height,
possibly through genetic differences, although it is perhaps more likely that the
adaptation of height to the tightening or loosening of environmental constraints may take
many generations. There are limits to the size of children that small women can bear, and
it has been argued that the century and a half of secular increase in heights in Europe,
which was both large and too rapid to be genetically based, was simply the time taken to
adjust to the better environment after 1850, Cole (2000).
If we add income to these height regressions, there are different effects depending on
which other factors are included, and as expected, there are indications of interactions
between income and infant mortality rates in some specifications. The addition of income
does little or nothing to reduce the importance of the regional dummies nor to explain the
differences in adult height between Africa and Asia. Nor does income reduce the marked
heteroscedasticity in Figure 6, with the scatter of adult heights around the regression
much larger in the countries with high mortality. Again, much of this comes from Africa,
where there is enormous diversity of average heights across countries, presumably
reflecting local nutritional, environmental, and disease conditions (or even genetic
differences) that are not captured either by income per capita or by infant mortality rates.

23

7. Discussion and conclusions

We have used data on 31 birth-cohorts from eleven European countries and from the
United States to investigate the early childhood determinants of adult height. We find that
infant mortality, particularly postneonatal mortality, predicts the adult height of the birth
cohort that survives it. Given that postneonatal mortality is a sensitive indicator of the
disease environment in the first year of life, these results support accounts in which some
form of “scarring” in infancy negatively affects lifetime health, as marked by adult
height. In these countries, the scarring effect of childhood disease dominates any possible
height-based selective mortality in childhood that would induce a positive relationship
between disease in early life and adult health.
In our pooled cross-section and time-series data from Europe and the US, variations
in postneonatal mortality can explain more than sixty percent of the variation in adult
heights, and the fall in postneonatal mortality can account for almost all of the increase in
adult heights between those born in 1950 and those born in 1980. More importantly,
postneonatal mortality displays a distinct historical pattern, falling to its minimum
attainable level, and then flattening out. This pattern is common across countries, but its
timing differs from country to country. The international variation in the timing of the
pattern of postneonatal mortality closely matches the country by country timing in the
rise and flattening out of average heights. Fluctuations in national income play no such
role, even though national income and average height are closely correlated in the crosssection.
We also find that the component of postneonatal mortality that most closely predicts
adult heights is mortality from pneumonia, not mortality from congenital anomalies,

24

mortality from intestinal disease, or mortality from other causes. Our finding is consistent
with the literature that argues that childhood diseases elicit inflammatory responses that
make heavy demands on nutrition, and that compromise ultimate growth. The lack of any
response to per capita GDP, albeit at best a weak measure of nutrition, suggests a
relatively weak role for gross nutrition.
The situation is different once we examine poor and rich countries simultaneously.
Among the poorest, highest mortality countries, we find evidence for distinct effects on
adult height of both disease and of food availability, as represented by income; these
results suggest that early childhood development is constrained both by food and by
disease in poor countries while, in now rich countries since 1950, the food constraint has
not been important. More notably, albeit with evidence that is best viewed as suggestive,
we find that selection may be stronger than scarring at high levels of mortality and low
levels of income, which would explain at least part of the African height paradox, that
Africans are relatively tall in spite of extremely unfavorable income and disease
environments. There is much stronger evidence that the effect of infant mortality on adult
height is weaker at higher mortality rates, which we attribute to the fact that selection is
stronger at high mortality.
Our results are also relevant for understanding the link between adult height and latelife chronic disease, and how that correlation might change historically and geographically. There is evidence that height is protective against cardiovascular disease in late-life,
which is consistent with an interpretation in which both adult height and late life disease
are caused by scarring in childhood. It is also possible that childhood disease, the quantity
vt in the model of Section 3, has a different effect on adult height from its effect on late

25

life disease, although there will still be an apparently protective effect of height on
disease reflecting the role of childhood disease on both. If so, and if it is true that, in the
highest mortality environments, selection outweigh scarring on adult heights, the negative
correlation between adult height and late-life chronic disease may be eliminated or even
reversed. In rich, low infant mortality countries, taller people have a survival advantage,
even conditional on obesity and other risk factors, but this advantage may not exist in
poor, high mortality countries now, and may not have existed historically in the now rich
countries. This is because the survivors of extreme negative environments, although
selected for both height and health, are still heavily scarred by their childhood
environment, and it may be the scarring more than the selection, that predicts late-life
chronic disease, even though both affect height in the same way. Unfortunately, we do
not have data on mortality from cardiovascular disease from sub-Saharan Africa on
which this prediction might be tested. Even so, recent work by Costa (2002, 2004) and by
Costa, Helmchen, and Wilson (2007) has shown or inferred very high levels of late-life
morbidity among veterans of the 19th century Union Army in the US, including morbidity
associated with arteriosclerosis and ischemic heart disease, at least some of which the
authors attribute to early life infections. Interestingly, and consistently with our account
here, Costa, Helmchen and Wilson find that adult height at enlistment did not predict
arteriosclerosis in late life among the survivors. In the historical record, as in the poorest
countries now, the prevalence of late-life chronic disease is masked by the importance of
infectious diseases. But it is quite possible that the age-specific prevalence of chronic
disease was higher in the past than now, and is currently high in some of the currently
poorest countries of the world.

Notes: Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. The F-tests in the last panel
are tests of the hypothesis that the coefficients on the four categories of PNM are identical; those in
columns 1, 2, and 5 are significant at better than one percent, those in columns three and four at better than
five percent, and those in the last three columns are insignificant.
