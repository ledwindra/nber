    "abstract": "\n\nWe examine whether credit rating agencies reward accurate or biased analysts. Using data collected from Moody\u2019s corporate debt credit reports, we find that Moody\u2019s is more likely to promote analysts who are accurate, but less likely to promote analysts who downgrade frequently.  Combined, analysts who are accurate but not overly negative are approximately twice as likely to get promoted. Further, analysts whose rating changes are more informative to the market are more likely to get promoted, unless their ratings changes cause large negative market reactions.  Moody\u2019s balances a desire for accuracy with a desire to cater to its corporate clients.\n\n",
