HOSPITAL COSTS AND THE COSt OF EMPTY HOSPITAL BEDS

ABSTRACT
The cost of excess capacity in the hospital industry has

reemerged as an important policy issue. Utilized capacity in the
hospital industry, as measured by the inpatient hospital bed
occupancy rate, has declined over the past 10 years and now stands

at approximately 65 percent. Congress and the Administration are
concerned that the costs associated with empty beds represent

wasteful expense and have proposed an adjustment to Medicare
payment rates which will penalize hospitals with low occupancy

rates. Hospitals, on the other hand, have indicated that the costs
of empty hospital beds are low and that reimbursement adjustments
are unnecessary.

In order to provide more current and representative estimates

of the cost of an empty hospital bed we estimate the cost function
model of Friedman and Pauly using data from a national sample of

5315 hospitals for the years 1963-1987. We find that empty beds
account for approximately 18 percent of total costs, or $546 per
admission (1987 dollars) .

The estimate (in 1987 dollars) of the

coat of an empty hospital bed is approximately $36,000.

I. INTRODUCTION
The cost of excess

capacity in the hospital
industry has
reemerged as an important
policy issue. In the 1970s and early
1980s, the cost of empty
hospital beds was an
important
justification for the health
planning program. With the
elimination of federal
funding for health planning,
interest in
the issue waned. Utilized
capacity in the hospital
industry, as
measured by the inpatient
hospital bed occupancy
rate, has
declined over the past
10 years and now stands
at approximately
65 percent.' While the costs of excess
capacity are borne
privately in other industries,
in the hospital
industry a large
portion of these costs
are publicly paid, due to the presence of
Medicare, Medicaid, and other
public programs.2 The exclusion
of capital coats from
Medicare'm prospective
reimbursement for
hospitals, combined with the
dramatic decline in
occupancy rates,
has reestablished the cost of empty hospital
beds as an important
public policy issue. As
capital becomes included in
the Medicare
prospective payment rate over a ten year period
Congress and the
Administration will continua
to be concerned that
the costs
associated with empty beds
represent wasteful expense. An
adjustment to Medicare
payment policy has been
proposed which

nor the associated penalties are observable, this is called the
"latent penalty" model.
If the hospital's inputs, such as labor, are fixed over the

relevant time period, e.g., due to contracts, then a rational

response to demand uncertainty is to hire "extrI inputs,

i.e.

"excess capacity", as a hedge against the latent penalty
associated with unexpectedly high realizations of demand. Thus,
inputs are chosen to minimize expected costs, taken

over all

possible realizations of demand. The "currently

fixed" inputs
can be referred to as "quasi—fixed inputs", and their
associated

costs

are termed "quasi—fixed costs". Costs are conseguemtly a
function of expected demand, actual demand, and other factors
such

as input prices, fixed capacity, and other hospital

characteristics which may effect costs,

hospital characteristics. Quasi—fixed costs will be increasing
in , expected output. Fixed costs are positively related to

k,

the level of fixed capacity.

In the case of hospitals, fixed capacity is

represented by
the number of hospital beds. If a bed is unoccupied, the

variable costs associated with output are avoided, hut fixed
costs which vary with the number of available beds are not. In
S

the context of the Friedman-PaulY model, the cost of an empty bed
which wee forecasted to be unoccupied will be lees than that of
an unexpectedly empty bed, since the variable costs associated

with the forecasted empty bed can be avoided. Thus, the cost of
an (expectedly) empty hospital bed is the fixed cost associated
with that bed. This is arguably the relevant cost of an empty
bed, since unexpectedly empty beds do not represent permanent
excess capacity (assuming rational forecasts).

we

used

data from the American Hospital Association's (AHA)

Annual Survey of Hospitals for each of the years 1983 through

1987. This is an annual aurvcy of the universe of hospitals in
the United States. it contains data on costa, payments to
inputs, output, hospital characteristics, and

other factors. In

addition, a Medicare case mix index for each hospital was
obtained from the U.S. Health Care Financing Adminiatration.a We
were able to obtain complete data for 5315 hospitals.9 Hospitals
were deleted if we could not match AHA and Medicare
identification numbers, if the hospital did not exist for all
five years, or if the hospital did not report information to the
ABA for all five years.

See Anderson and Lave (1986) for more detail.

B. VARIABLES

Dependent Variable
The dependent variable is average cost, measured in real

tens. This variable was constructed by dividing each hospital's
total annual expenses by the number of admissions for the year.
The implicit GNP deflator was used to convert all money figures
to 1983 dollars.

Independent Variables
The independent variables are the ratio of expected to
actusl output, the inverse of the occupancy rate, the number of
hospital beds, the wage rate, the Medicare case mix index, a
dummy variable indicating whether the hospital is for—profit, a
dummy variable indicating if the hospital is public, and a dummy
variable indicating if the hospital is a teaching hospital (if

there are any interns or residents). Descriptive statistics for
all the variables are displayed in Table 1.
Output is measured as the nuaber of inpatient admissions to

the hospital in a year. Expected output is the econometric
forecast of output for the hospital, as in Friedman and Pauly
(1981) .'°

Since we had s relatively short time series for each

hospital (eight years), we were unable to forecast expected
output for each hospital using pure time series methods as

10A11A data covering the period 1980—1987 were used for the
purposes of forecasting expected admissions. The model used three
lags, thus there were forecasted values for 1983-1987.
7

Friedman and Pauly did- Rather we exploited the cross—sectional
as well as the time series variation in the data to generate
forecasts for expected output for each hospital by grouping the
hospitals by geographic area.11 Hospitals which were in the
following categories were pooled together: hospitals in the sane
Metropolitan Statistical Area (NSA), hospitals in the sane urban
area, hospitals in rural sreas in the sane state.11 There were

365 such areas. The forecasting equation used three lags for
admissions, a time trend, and hospital specific dummies. The
hospital specific intercepts allowed us to generate forecasts for
each hospital even though the forecasting equation was estimated

for pooled sets of hospitals. The fits for the forecasting
equations were excellent, with RZ5 in the range of 0.97 to 0.99.
Examples for three NSA5 are reported in an appendix.

The inverse of the occupancy rate is a proxy for fixed

capacity. Assuming that fixed costs are positively related to
capacity, average fixed costs will depend positively on the

inverse of the occupancy rate- In addition, the number of
inpatient beds is allowed to shift the cost function. This
variable may proxy for unmeasured severity of illness associated
with large size or perhaps economies of scale or scope (Anderson
and Lave, 1986).

11since hospitals in the same area share common shocks specific

to their market, perhaps not too much is violated by pooling
hospitals in this manner for the purpose of forecasting.

11MSA5 or urban areas with only one hospital were combined
with rural hospitals in the sane state. There were 14 such areas.
a

There are no reported data on wages (or other input prices)
by hospital, therefore we used reported payroll per full time
equivalent (PTE) employee as a proxy for hospital wages.12 An
alternative would have been to use a hospital wage index
constructed by HCFA for the purpose of Medicare reimbursement,

but this index is area, rather than hospital specific. the
Medicare case mix index measures the complexity of a hospital's
Medicare cases in any given year in terms of their relative

costliness. It is constructed by HCFA for the purposes of
Medicare reimbursement (see Pettengill and Vertrees (1982) for

details). Last, the ownership form of the hospital and teaching
status are control variables for hospital characteristics which

may affect cost. A hospital is defined as a teaching hospital if
it has any interns or residents.

IV. ECONOMETRIC ISSUES

The model was estimated by the method of fixed effects, or
least squares with dummy variables. Dummy variables for each
hospital represented unobserved hospital specific effects which

are constant over time. Dummy variables for each year control
for the effect of secular changes over time.

Since the cost function we estinate has not been derived
from a specific production technology, there is no particular

services. Expenditures on labor constitute approximately 80% of
hospital costs (Freeland, Anderson, and Schendlsr, 1979).

functional

form which is indicated. Friedman and Pauly employed

a linear functional torn, and Pauly and Wilson explored a
a'

logarithmic

as well as a linear functional form. Since the

logarithmic functional form has been widely used in the
literature on hospital cost functions, and since the linear form
has been used for estimation of this particular cost function, we
felt we should explore the issue of the appropriate functional

form. MacKinnon, White, and Davidson (1983) provide a
specification test for distinguishing between non—nested models:

the "Extended Projection" or E test. The linear specification
was rejected in favor of the logarithmic specification at the 1*
level.'3 Nonetheless, we report the estimates of the linear
functional form for the purposes of comparison with earlier work.
There were two other salient issues to consider concerning
the econometric specification: heteroskedasticity and

multicollinearity. It is often alleged that the errors in
hospital cost regressions are heteroakedastic due to the

differing sizes of the institutions. For that reason we employed
the Breusch-Pegan (1979) test for heteroskedasticity of a

particular form. A computationally convenient form of the test
consists of regressing the squared residuals from the cost

3The test statistic is the t-statistic on the difference of
the log of the predicted values from the linear model and the
predicted values from the logarithmic value in an augmented linear

regression. Significance of this statistic implies rejection of

regression on hospital bed size. The test statistic is equal to
the product of the R2 f roe this regression multiplied by the

nusber of observations." it is asymptotically distributed x2

with degrees of freedom equal to the number of regressors. The

R2 from this regression is zero, therefore the hypothesis of
homoskedastic errors cannot be rejected)5 Last, we were
concerned that there might be significant collinearity among
regressors such as bed size, occupancy rate, and admissions,

we

therefore utilized the diagnostics of Belsley, Kub, and Welsch

(1920) to check for sulticollinearity. These diagnostics did not
detect any significant impact of multicollinearity,

V. RESULTS
Table 2 contains the fixed effects estimates of the cost

function. The estimates of the individual hospital and time
fixed effects are not reported. Column 1 contains the estimates
from the logarithmic functional form

and

column 2 contains

estimates using the linear functional form. Since the signs of
the estimates do not differ between the two columns (with one
exception), we shall mainly discuss the estimates from column 1.
Most of the parameter estimates are consistent with
expectations and with the results of Friedman and Pauly and

Pauly

LaGrange multiplier test statistic and is also robust to non-

normality (Koenker, 1981).

the occupancy rate is also positive and significant, consistent
with its interpretation as a proxy for fixed capacity costs. The
coefficient on bed size is not significant, but the total effect
of the number of hospital beds is positive.16

This result is

consistent with the findings in sost studies of hospital costs
that the total effect of bed size on cost is positive.

The

effect of bed size is negative and significant in the linear
specification, although the total effect of bed size is still

positive. The wage rate and case nix index have a positive
impact on costs, as expected. Finally, teaching hospitals are
not significantly more costly, for-profits cost more, and public
hospitals cost less.

VI. WHAT IS THE COST OF WN EMPTY BED?

this section we report calculations of the costs
associated with empty beds based en the estimates reported
In

Table 2. we report two figures1 the proportion

in

of total costs

which are fixed costs and the total fixed cost per bed- The
proportion of total costs due to empty beds is unitless and hence
is useful for the purpose of comparison with previous estimates.
As mentioned previously, comparisons of estimates

of the cost of

an empty bed may be.confounded by changes in technology or

16Recall that the inverse of the occupancy rate is defined

as (65 x Beds)/Daya.
12

changes in regulatory policy.

The proportion of costs which are fixed costs represent the

proportion of costs attributable to empty beds. Figure 1
illustrates the basis for this measure. Long run marginal cost
(LMC) and average cost (Ac) are equal at minimum efficient scale,

q* (e.g., at the minimum of the average cost curve). At thia
point there is no excess capacity and average cost contains no

fixed costs. At the observed output, , the ratio of long run
marginal cost to average cost (MC()/AC()) thus provides an
indication of how far hospitals are from minimum efficient scale,
since at minimum efficient scale this ratio equals one.

Comparing the inverse of this ratio to one ([AC(e)/MC()]-l)
provides an estimate of the proportion of costs which are fixed,

since there is no excess of average costs over long run marginal

costs at efficient capacity. Applying this proportion to average
costs yields an estimate of the fixed cost per case.17

The cost of an empty bed is the estimate of total fixed

costs per bed. Since the inverse of the occupancy rate
representS fixed capacity, its marginal impact on average cost
can be used to quantify the total fixed cost per bed.

Multiplying the marginal impact by the inverse occupancy rate

1TThis is actually an overestisate, or upper bound, since
marginal costs are higher at minimum efficient scale than at points
below it. The correct measure is [AC(4)/MC(q*) ]—l. Since observed
•

output is less than minimum efficient scale, q*, our estimate of

long run marginal cost is less than marginal cost at minimum
efficient scale, and the ratio AC()/MC() is thus somewhat too
large.
13

yields the total impact on average cost. Further multiplying by
total admissions and dividing by total beds generates the total
fixed cost per bed, or the cost of an empty bed.18

Table 3 contains estimates for the cost impacts of empty
beds from both the logarithmic and linear forms, although we only
discuss the estimates from the logarithmic form.19 The estimate
of the ratio of long run marginal cost to average cost is 0.85.

This is close to the figures for this ratio reported by Pauly and

Wilson of 0.85 to 0.9. Friedman and Pauly (1981) a figure of
report 0.98, and Friedman and Pauly (1983) report ratios of 0.92

to 1. This implies that the proportion of total cost
attributable to empty beds (i.e., fixed costs) is approximately

18 percent. This amounts to $546 per admission in 1987 dollars.
The estimates of the cost of an empty bed are also reported

in Table 3. The cost of an empty bed from the logarithmic form
is $32,568 ($37,918 in 1987 dollars). This estimate is in the
mid—range of previous estimates, although it is larger than those

produced by the same method. This may be due to changes in the
hospital production process which may have led to higher fixed
costa (e.g., the diffusion of capital intensive new technologies
such as magnetic resonance imaging), actual diseconoaiss

18This impact is equal to (Inverse Opcupency 1ete) x
(Admissions)/Beds for the linear form and fl(Average Cost) x
(Admissions)/Beds for the logarithmic form, where $ is the
estimated coefficient of the inverse occupancy rate. Since the
inverse of the occupancy rate represents fixed capacity, the
estimate of its impact on average cost is marginal fixed cost.
19

These are evaluated at the sample means of all vsriables.
14

associated with lower occupancy rates (i.e., movement "back up"

the average cost curve), or changea in incentives under the

Prospective Payment System. Thus, it is difficult to discern
whether the cost of an empty bed is truly "higher" than
previously estimated by this method, or whether the production of
hospital services has changed in important but unmeasurable ways.

These estimates, while significant, is not as large as some

policymakers have contemded. We believe that 18 percent
represents an upper bound on actual realizable cost savings due
to bed reductions, because actual cost savings depend on the

method and volume of bed reductions. In addition, society may
value excese cepacity in the hospital system.2°

20

The optimal number of beds, of course, depends not just
on the cost of an empty bed, but also on the benefit of an enpty
bed, i.e., the social value placed on having beds available when
needed.
