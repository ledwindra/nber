    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies the biggest fiscal challenge currently facing many U.S. cities, namely public-sector pension obligations. Employing a regression discontinuity design (RDD), it tests whether the mayor\u2019s party impacts a city\u2019s public-sector pensions. Pension benefits are shown to grow faster under Democratic-party mayors, while contribution payments simultaneously fall behind. Previous research showed that parties do not matter in U.S. cities for a wide range of fiscal expenditure types, purportedly because voters impose fiscal discipline. This paper shows that parties can matter when expenditures benefit a narrow interest group and are difficult to observe for tax payers.\n\n",
