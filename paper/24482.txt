Engineering Informal Institutions: Long-run Impacts of Alternative Dispute Resolution on
Violence and Property Rights in Liberia

ABSTRACT
Informal institutions govern property rights and disputes when formal systems are weak. Wellfunctioning institutions should help people reach and maintain bargains, minimizing violence.
Can outside organizations engineer improvements and reduce violent conflicts? Will this improve
property rights and investment? We experimentally evaluate a UN and civil society mass
education campaign to promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR) practices and norms in rural
communities, where violent land disputes are common. Prior work showed a fall in violence and
unresolved disputes within one year. We return after three years to test for sustained impacts and
channels. Treated communities report large, sustained falls in violent disputes and a slight shift
towards nonviolent norms. Treated residents also report larger farms, though overall effects on
property rights and investments are mixed. Politically-connected residents report more secure
property rights while those with fewer connections feel less secure. Sustained social engineering
is feasible but politics shapes distributional outcomes.

Introduction

Informal institutions matter for order and development. These are the unwritten rules and
practices that govern everyday behavior, social interactions, market activity, and property
rights.1 In cases where formal justice is absent or overloaded, informal systems resolve
disputes and provide property rights. This describes many low-income countries, especially
rural regions and fragile states emerging from conflict. Even in strong states, however,
informal systems resolve everyday conflict most of the time, albeit in the shadow of the law
(e.g. Azari and Smith 2012).
Policymakers frequently try to shape and strengthen informal institutions. This raises
several questions. Can more just, equal, or peaceful systems be engineered? Are there unintended consequences? And will better micro-level institutions promote local development?
This paper presents the short- and long-term impacts of an attempt to engineer better
informal institutions in post-war rural Liberia. In 2009–10, the government of Liberia, the
United Nations (UN), and various civil society organizations conducted a large-scale alternative dispute resolution (ADR) campaign. ADR is a set of informal practices of mediation
and negotiation that are intended to help parties reach self-enforcing bargains (Mnookin
1998; Lieberman and Henry 1986). It tries to establish a shared language and practice of
dispute resolution, improve communication, and contain emotion, keeping people at the bargaining table. It also tries to shape local social norms to discourage parties to a conflict from
breaking bargains or using violence.
In some respects this parallels the way conflict is modeled in international relations. Violence in village disputes is viewed as a form of bargaining breakdown that results from commitment problems, asymmetric information, and deviations from rational decision-making,
such as emotional outbursts. ADR fosters skills and norms to help disputants behave more
rationally, exchange information, and commit to negotiated or mediated solutions.2
We worked with implementers to set up the ADR intervention as a randomized controlled
trial. The government nominated 246 eligible communities, 85 of which were assigned to and
received the ADR training. In these locations, implementers invited a sixth of all adults to
participate in eight days of training spread over several months, including extensive coaching
and practice in ADR. The implementers trained more than 12,000 people in 2009–10. This
mass education approach was based on the idea that community education shifts knowledge,
1

A common definition of informal institutions is the shared unwritten rules of appropriate behavior
enforced through social sanction and praise, and through neocustomary or “traditional” mechanisms of
adjudication and dispute resolution (Ellickson 1991; Knight 1992; North 1990).
2
There are close parallels between ADR at the micro level and how international relations scholars conceive
of peace mediation and why it is effective (Beber 2012).

skills, and norms, resulting in behavior change.
In previous work, we reported impacts roughly one year after the average community
was treated (Blattman et al. 2014). Most communities had a lingering backlog of unresolved
disputes. Consistent with improved bargaining, the intervention reduced the number of
unresolved disputes by 29%. There were also some indications of a decrease in violence
related to these disputes, but after one year these results were generally not statistically
significant.
This paper assesses longer term impacts on a broader range of outcomes and mechanisms.
We collected new data three years after the average community received the campaign. On
the one hand, this allows more time for institutional changes to set in. On the other hand,
achieving persistent change in conflict norms is difficult. It is one thing to change dispute
practices in the short term, and another to change the informal rules that govern communities
in the long run.
Two years after the first endline survey, in 2013, we returned to collect data on over
7,500 plots of town and farm land, including information about disputes, property security,
and investments. We also collected data on ADR knowledge, skills, and norms from over
4,000 community residents. We first look at whether short-term effects on the resolution and
severity of disputes persist over time. Second, we look for effects that may take more than a
year to materialize, especially property rights security and investment. Third, we investigate
potential mechanisms, which were not measured in our 1-year survey. Finally, we explore
the program’s long-term impact on power differentials within communities—an important
source of property rights insecurity in West Africa (Goldstein and Udry 2008; Besley and
Ghatak 2009).
We highlight seven sets of results. First, disputes are ever-present, and treatment has
little apparent effect on the incidence of disputes at either endline. Second, treatment reduces
the number of persistent and hard-to-resolve in the first year. We do not see any increase
in the speed or level of dispute resolution after three years. One reason might be that the
backlog of longstanding disputes was dealt with in the first year.
Third and most important, after three years we see a significant drop in hostilities and
violence associated with disputes—land, business, and interpersonal. For instance, about
half of all land disputes involve angry threats, property destruction (like trampling crops),
and interpersonal violence (like fistfights). In treated communities, a land dispute is about
40% less likely to involve any of these hostilities at the three year endline.
Fourth, we find no evidence that more peaceful dispute resolution increased perceived
security of property rights and investment. We expected that stronger informal dispute
resolution systems might improve residents’ property rights security and increase their will2

ingness to make costly investments in their homes and farms. A large political economy
literature suggests the right to investment returns shapes investment incentives (Besley and
Ghatak 2009; Goldstein and Udry 2008), although hard evidence is still emerging.3 After
one year we did not find any effect on security or investment, but we hypothesized that such
an effect might take longer to realize. We find no evidence that it did, and some evidence of
a negative effect on property rights in the long term.
Fifth, this average effect masks important variation. Villagers with established tenure
or political connections reported better security as a result of the intervention. Poorer
respondents, less politically connected individuals, and people with farm plots owned by
other villagers all felt slightly less secure in treatment villages—an adverse effect that seems
to further disadvantage those who are already vulnerable. We have to take these sub-group
analyses with some caution, as they were not pre-specified. Nonetheless, our results are
consistent with other studies showing that informal institutions can favor the powerful and
well-connected (Isser et al. 2009), and that these individuals tend to invest more and have
higher output (Goldstein and Udry 2008; Besley and Ghatak 2009).4
Sixth, our results suggest that ADR worked in part because it promoted norms of nonviolence, especially managing of emotions, and hence made it easier to reach self-enforcing
peaceful bargains. This is in line with our interpretation of ADR through the lens of noncooperative bargaining theory. We were unable to test this interpretation directly in our
1-year analysis, since we lacked direct measures of skill and norms change. For the 3-year
endline, we developed a battery of questions on resolution skills and norms. We see some
evidence of a persistent change in skills related to managing emotions and avoiding violence,
as well as norms and attitudes around violent behavior.
Finally, our evidence suggests that ADR mass education would be more cost-effective
if implementers could find a more efficient system of imparting new skills and norms. The
intervention was funded with a $1.2 million grant. We need to make many assumptions
to estimate the cost per violent dispute avoided, but reasonable estimates suggest that the
intervention “breaks even” after three years only if avoiding a violent dispute is worth an
amount equal to twice the average Liberian’s annual income. Even for a proof-of-concept
3

New experimental work in Benin by Goldstein et al. (2015) suggests that interventions targeting property
rights insecurity, such as demarcation, can induce investment in previously insecure plots.
4
We must weigh these findings against the advantages of informal institutions, which previous research
shows may be as good or better than formal governance mechanisms under certain conditions. Ostrom
(1990)’s classic work on governing common resources demonstrates how communal governance mechanisms
can lead to better outcomes for all community members. Tsai (2007) and Xu and Yao (2015) show how
informal mechanisms of accountability, including moral authority, can increase public goods provision in
China. Dispute resolution through informal institutions is often quicker, cheaper, and more accessible than
through formal ones, especially in places where the police and courts are corrupt or dysfunctional (Isser et al.
2009).

3

trial, this is a relatively high cost to avoid only moderately intense violence. Moving ahead,
we believe implementers ought to test the effectiveness of programs that use information
technology or other means to deliver cheaply at scale.
Taken together, our results suggest that engineering better informal institutions is feasible
but costly, and risks some unintended consequences. On the one hand, the persistent decline
in violence associated with disputes and the change in norms around managing emotions
and avoiding violence shows that it is possible to improve bargaining behavior and avoid
breakdown. This is remarkable given that the intervention lasted only two months in each
village, and given that we measured outcomes a full three years after implementation.
On the other hand, the program’s differential effects suggest that strengthening informal
institutions could reinforce existing inequalities in power and security. The program’s steep
price tag gives further cause for concern. These results offer a more nuanced understanding
of the advantages and limitations of attempts to re-engineer informal institutions, and also
demonstrate the usefulness of assessing the durability of institutional change over time—a
rarity for evaluations of this kind.

Setting

Liberia is a small West African nation and one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking below the 7th percentile of all countries on the Human Development Index, including
Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Jahan 2016). Between 1989 and 2003,
two civil wars killed hundreds of thousands and displaced a majority of the population.
Many factors contributed to the conflict, including over-centralized political power, ethnic
and class tensions, and struggles over land and natural resource rights.5 A 2003 agreement
ushered in peace, and three democratic elections ensued. Events in this paper stretch from
2008 to 2012, five years after the end of the civil war and two years before the outbreak of
Ebola. This was a time of relative stability and economic growth.

2.1

Property and property rights

Small-holder agriculture provides the livelihood for most rural Liberians. Farmers depend on
rain-fed subsistence crops of rice, cassava, and vegetables (Corriveau-Bourque 2010), while
tree crops (e.g. coffee and cocoa) and rubber production supplement income.6 Land is often

the role conflict over property and natural resources played in the civil war.

a household’s most important asset (Boone 2014; Baldwin 2015).
Outside the coastal zone and major towns, Liberian law recognizes a customary system
of property rights. Under this regime, communities exercise collective ownership rights over
the land (Alden-Wiley 2007; Boone 2014). Local leaders administer property on behalf of
the community, and can assign temporary use of a plot for growing food. Leaders can also
assign long-term rights of use that can be passed down within a family.
As in other parts of West Africa, political influence and connections in the community
shape what rules apply (Berry 2009; Boone 2014). For instance, land access and long-term
rights are typically based on real or imagined ties to indigenous or first-comer status in
a village. Historically, “neocustomary” systems have also tended to provide more secure
rights to older men, and those from the majority ethnic group. Women, youth, members of
minority groups, and the politically unconnected can find themselves at a disadvantage.
Land rights are often contested. Households may lay claim to the same plot of land, or
may have different understandings of the type and length of use they have been granted.
Natural boundaries (the most common type of boundary) may change over time, leading
to disagreements. Confusion over property rights law also gives people the opportunity to
act in bad faith (Stevens 2014). Liberia is rife with tales of “double-selling” and fraudulent
documents. These too create the conditions for disputes.
Most of these issues are magnified by fourteen years of political instability and violence,
1989-2003. Violence displaced nearly the entire rural population of the country for years.
Written records were destroyed, and oral records were often lost when community leaders or
elders were displaced, emigrated, or died. Upon returning home, people naturally used the
most convenient or productive land, regardless of historical rights. This aggravated disputes
over borders and inheritance, which became a key challenge in the post-war era. In 2011,
16% of all households nationwide reported a land dispute since the war’s end, and 10%
reported another major dispute, such as over money or inheritance (Vinck et al. 2011).

2.2

Dispute resolution

Liberians seldom use the formal courts to resolve property disputes. This is especially true
outside the major towns, and in cases that do not involve serious crimes. Police and court
systems were slowly rebuilding after the war, and they remain expensive, inefficient, and
often corrupt (M’Cormack 2017; Unruh 2009; Isser et al. 2009).
As a result, informal institutions are the dominant way local disputes are resolved in
Liberia. Almost three-quarters of respondents with land disputes in our sample sought to
for measuring property sizes is not easily available in most of the study area, leading to error in respondent
estimations.

5

resolve their dispute with an informal authority. Local leaders, family members, neighbors,
and the parties themselves mediate and negotiate. While this system can be cheap and
effective, it has limitations. Nationwide, roughly 40% of land disputes and 16% of non-land
disputes recorded in 2011 remained unresolved (Vinck et al. 2011, 61). Nationally, 20%
of disputes eventually turned violent (p. 49). Nearly half of land disputes in our study
communities involved some form of threats or aggression.
Most of this violence is low-level and limited: trampling of crops, defacement, fist fights,
and so forth. Sometimes tit-for-tat reprisals escalate into greater and greater violence, however. The government of Liberia and UN peacekeepers have long been concerned that these
local incidents could spark a national crisis. This, too, has occurred in our study areas. In
2008, for instance, a dispute over farmland between two politicians erupted into widespread
violence. In 2010 the mysterious death of a girl in one of our control villages escalated into
countywide ethnic riots and political strain.

3

The intervention

In response to these challenges, in 2008 the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) and an NGO, the Justice and Peace Commission (JPC) proposed a mass education
program that would promote alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in Liberian towns and
villages. ADR is a set of informal practices and norms of negotiation and mediation. It
is intended to help parties reach self-enforcing bargains faster than courts (Mnookin 1998;
Lieberman and Henry 1986). UNHCR and JPC referred to the program as “peace education”.
The implementers set out to recruit about a sixth of adults into training workshops in
each community. Each workshop involved eight days of training in groups of 35 residents,
led by two facilitators. Training days were spread over two months, allowing trainees to
practice in between. Workshops were fairly homogenous across communities. There was no
public information campaign to the broader community outside of the workshops. But the
implementers hoped for the skills, practices, and norms to spread by example and word of
mouth.
The curriculum emphasized specific ADR tools, skills, and practices, including: (i) direct
engagement in one’s own or others’ disputes; (ii) strategies for problem solving and negotiation; (iii) face-saving and “positive-sum” resolutions; (iv) avoidance of forum shopping
and the formal justice system; and (v) strategies to avoid anger, threats, and violence, plus
norms against all of these. Workshops combined lectures with group discussion, participatory dramas, and opportunities for people to share experiences. Sessions drew on a wide
range of examples, including community and group conflicts, but emphasized interpersonal
6

conflicts, especially land, money, domestic, and neighbor disputes.
UNHCR and JPC not only targeted leaders who already mediated many disputes, but
also strongly encouraged and trained ordinary residents to negotiate their own disputes or
mediate disputes amongst neighbors. This push for everyday negotiation and mediation was
a major theme. The implementers did not want to create a greater backlog of disputes for
local leaders or elites.
Facilitators typically lived and slept in communities on weekdays for the full 2–3 months.
They ran the workshops almost continuously, given how many adults had to pass through
each day of training. After-hours interactions with participants provided an opportunity to
demonstrate, facilitate, and reinforce the ideas and norms taught in workshops. Facilitators
seldom played a direct role in disputes as mediators, however. The principal treatment
seemed to be the workshop.

3.1

Sample selection

UNHCR and JPC worked in 3 of Liberia’s 15 counties: Lofa, Nimba, and Grand Gedeh.
These are denser and more war-affected regions, and were expected to have more disputes
and weaker social bonds. With the support of JPC and UNHCR, county officials nominated
246 communities they felt could benefit from the intervention, ranging in size from 100 to
5000 persons. Officials tried to select what they believed to be “conflict-prone” communities.
But compared to national data, our sample is not extreme, with rates of land conflict only
moderately higher than the national average (Vinck et al. 2011).
Within treated communities, facilitators and community leaders mobilized residents for
the training in various ways. This included community leader recommendations, self-nominations,
and door-to-door canvasing. On average, community members who participated in the workshops look much like those who did not. Comparing pre-intervention traits shows that minority status had little association with attendance, nor did several of the strongest correlates
of land conflict—having your land or house taken during the war, having been a refugee or
displaced, or being a victim of war violence. However, trainees were slightly more likely to
be older, male, lifetime residents with land.

4.1

Theoretical frame and predictions
ADR through the lens of noncooperative bargaining

We view disputes in Liberia as classic problems of non-cooperative bargaining with no third
party to enforce resolutions. In this view, bargaining breakdowns result from incomplete
7

information and commitment problems. Failure to resolve disputes may also be caused by
parties’ lack of trust and their resulting failure to communicate, or their assumption that
negotiation is a zero-sum game, encouraging them to bluff, mislead, and use strong-arm
tactics to gain advantage (Deutsch et al. 2011). These are classic bargaining failures, most
commonly used to understand labor disputes and international conflict (Kennan and Wilson
1993; Fearon 1995, 1998), but directly applicable to interpersonal conflicts as well.
Disputants may also behave irrationally: they are often loss averse; they assume their
preferences are incompatible with others; they undervalue concessions and miss mutually
advantageous moves; they allow conflict to escalate even when the optimal decision would
be to change strategy; and they hold self-serving recall biases accentuated by ambiguous
information (Bazerman et al. 2000; Kahneman et al. 1991). Emotion can exacerbate these
problems, slowing the bargaining process and increasing the length of disputes and the risk
of violence.
We view ADR as an attempt to solve these bargaining problems. ADR aims to reduce
the length and cost of disputes and to improve the quality of outcomes (Lieberman and
Henry 1986). It does so by imparting skills and practices (how to resolve disputes) and
fostering norms (how people ought to resolve disputes) that should, in principle, improve
communication, foster mutual understanding, and build trust in negotiation and third party
mediation.
More specifically, ADR aims to reduce imperfect information by promoting empathy,
honesty, open communication, and active listening. It encourages disputants to be aware of
their own biases and to seek mutually advantageous bargains, thus mitigating commitment
problems. And it attempts to activate mechanisms of social sanction or praise by stigmatizing
defection from whatever agreement the parties reach.
ADR can thus be understood as a “technology” of dispute resolution relayed through
short, repeated training sessions. By establishing new norms and skills, ADR provides
a new framework for informally resolving disputes, and thus a new informal institution.
But new informal institutions do not emerge in a vacuum. ADR inevitably interacts with
existing mechanisms for regulating behavior and resolving disputes, and this interaction may
undermine the very goals that ADR seeks to achieve.

4.2

Unintended consequences

ADR training might have a number of unintended and perhaps adverse effects. ADR encourages parties to seek a mediated solution outside of the courts, which may result in more
efficient bargaining, but may also allow powerful individuals to prevent other parties from

8

seeking redress in venues where they might receive fairer treatment. Those in privileged
positions may also use ADR to legitimate biased decisions reached through existing informal institutions. And because bargains reached through ADR are by nature unenforceable
(Sternlight 2006), they may only accentuate local power imbalances. In short, ADR may
produce quick and inexpensive resolutions, but there is no guarantee it will produce fair
ones (Edwards 1986, 679).
New informal institutions may also simply fail to take hold, especially if they threaten
the existing social and political hierarchy. New rules and mechanisms of social enforcement
are inherently uncertain, and communities may fail to coordinate on them (Knight 1992).
And while the literature on norm diffusion suggests that education can produce a “cascade
effect” through which new norms spread from influential actors to the rest of the group (e.g.
Kuran 1997), norms tend to be sticky, and the mechanisms of social sanction and praise that
sustain them can prevent individuals from abandoning old norms or adopting new ones, even
if they would otherwise like to (Cloward 2014).

4.3

Predictions

After one year we expected to find an increase in the durability of bargains and, given a
decrease in the probability of bargaining breakdowns, a reduction in violence as first order
outcomes. Our 3-year survey looks for persistent impacts on the same outcomes, and for a
longer-term shift towards the skills, practices, and norms emphasized in the ADR curriculum.
To the extent that dispute resolution improves, we also expected to see improvements in
perceived security of property rights, particularly around land, and increased investment and
economic activity. However, we also expected that social and demographic characteristics
might influence the extent to which particular sub-groups benefitted from the treatment.

5
5.1

Empirical strategy and data
Experimental design

We randomized assignment to the ADR intervention, as well as the timing and intensity of
treatment. Of the 246 eligible communities, we stratified by county and randomly assigned
116 to treatment. Communities were widely spread across space, with little risk of spillovers
between them.
Implementation occurred over 21 months, from March 2009 to November 2010. We
randomized the order of treatment into five phases. We did this mainly to guard against
unanticipated interruptions, which indeed occurred. UNHCR ran out of funds and stopped
9

the intervention in Phase 4. To estimate treatment effects, we pool the Phase 5 communities
into the control group for a total of 160 control communities.
In addition, because of implementation delays, a small number of communities received
the intervention at the same time as the first endline survey. Most of these “late treatment”
communities were in Phase 4, and we selected them randomly for late treatment. Our
one-year treatment effects estimates account for them (see below).
We also assigned 16 of the 86 treatment communities (26 of the original 116) to an
“intense” treatment, with 30 to 40% more workshops. We did this in order to assess the
marginal effect of increased training beyond the NGO’s 15% target. Nonetheless, our main
focus was on the treatment-control comparison.
As we show in the appendix, random assignment produced the expected degree of balance along covariates. Table A.1 reports means for a selection of 41 baseline covariates by
experimental assignment. For the most part, background attributes appear balanced across
experimental conditions. There are some minor differences between treatment and control
communities: 3 of the 41 mean differences (7%) have p < .1. Overall the imbalance is
consistent with chance and is robust to alternative balance tests.

5.2

Data and main outcomes

Shortly before program implementation, we conducted a baseline survey, in March-April
2009. We collected endline data one and three years later on average. The first endline ran
from November 2010 to January 2011—19 months after the first community received the
training, and 10.6 months after the average community received the training. The second
endline ran from February to April 2013—44 months after the first community received the
training, and 35.6 months after the average community received the training. For simplicity
we refer to the two surveys as the 1-year and 3-year endlines.
In each round, we surveyed quasi-random cross-sections of roughly 20 residents per community. We selected households by using the “random route” method (described in detail
in the appendix). Non-response was typically less than 5 to 10% per community; nonresponding households were replaced with a neighbor. To measure community-level outcomes and traits, we also surveyed four leaders at baseline and each endline—typically a
town chief and a female, youth, and minority leader. We use the average response for continuous measures and the modal response for indicators.
The 1-year endline collected data in 243 of the 246 communities. (Two extremely remote
villages could not be reached by surveyors, and one tiny village disbanded before the endline.
All three were in the control group.) The 3-year endline collected data in 204 of the 245

10

communities still in existence in 2012. Due to budget constraints and the disproportionate
number of control villages, we dropped s a selection of 40 control communities that were most
dissimilar from treatment, stratified by county. Given the high fixed cost of reaching each
village, this was the most cost-effective means to maximize statistical power and minimize
bias.
Both endline surveys pre-date the development of the social science registry, and so
primary and secondary outcomes were not pre-registered. The published 1-year results effectively pre-specify primary outcomes for the 3-year analysis, however. Thus this paper focuses
first and foremost on land dispute outcomes (incidence, resolution, and violence, with new
information on dispute length and details of any violence). As in the previous paper, we also
examine a broader set of business and interpersonal disputes. The 3-year survey also added
questions on a number of secondary outcomes: property security, investment, and skills and
norms of dispute resolution. While these were not formally pre-specified, they were explicitly
mentioned in the previous paper as outcomes of interest.

5.3

Estimation

We estimate program impacts by calculating intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates via the weighted
least squares regression:
Yij = θTj + βXij + αd + ij
where Yij denotes the outcome for respondent i in community j; Tj is an indicator for
assignment to treatment; Xij is a set of baseline covariates; αd are district fixed effects; and
ij is an individual error term, clustered by community. When outcomes are binary, this linear
probability model approach to ITT estimation is standard, as it simplifies interpretation of
the treatment effects without materially affecting the efficiency or accuracy of the ITT.
In the 3-year endline, we weight communities by the inverse probability of selection into the
endline sample.7 In the 1-year results only, X also includes an indicator for the handful of
Phase 4 treatment villages that were randomly assigned to be treated concurrently with the
first endline survey. Our tables focus on the main treatment effect, θ, which averages communities treated 25–44 months beforehand in the 3-year survey, and 1–19 months beforehand
in the 1-year survey.
7

This specification differs from the previously published results in that we estimate an intent-to-treat
effect (ITT) rather than a complier average causal effect (CACE). The CACE estimator allowed us to
account for concurrent treatment, but this is no longer relevant 3 years after the intervention. Our results
are substantively unchanged regardless.

11

All outcome measures are self-reported. If training leads to social desirability bias (so
that residents under-report disputes, or repeat back norms), we will overestimate treatment
effects. While this is a risk, the pattern of effects we observe is inconsistent with social
desirability bias: while some treatment effects are consistent with the messages of the intervention (e.g. positive effects on norms prohibiting the use of violence), others are not
(e.g. null effects on norms related to bias, defection, and empathy). These nulls provide
reassurance that the significant effects we observe are not artifacts of social desirability bias
alone. Moreover, given the length of time between the intervention and the 3-year endline, it
is implausible that social desirability bias persisted without any actual change in underlying
norms, skills and behaviors.

Land disputes We begin, in Table 1, with the primary outcomes of the one-year study:
the incidence, severity and resolution of land disputes. At each endline, we asked respondents
whether they had any “serious dispute” over land in the past year, including any that had
already been resolved. More than a fifth of households reported a land dispute in the first
endline; this had fallen to just under one in ten by the three-year endline. This decline may
reflect the natural resolution of disputes arising from mass displacement and return, though
we do not have the data or research design to be sure. Treatment, however, does not appear
to affect the incidence of disputes. This is largely consistent with our theoretical predictions:
disputes are ever present, and ADR was designed to help manage them peacefully, not
eliminate them entirely.
We then asked if the dispute had been resolved by the time of the survey. About a
third remained unresolved in both endlines. After one year, the proportion of residents
with an unresolved land dispute fell by 2 percentage points in treatment communities, a
28% reduction versus the control group. Conditional on having a dispute, we observed a
10.5% increase in the rate of resolution after one year in treatment communities. We see
no evidence of a continued decrease in unresolved disputes after three years, however, nor
do we see a decrease in dispute length (a new measure). In the previously published study,
we speculated that the program was especially effective in resolving the most serious and
longstanding disputes, since the largest effect was in the subset of disputes that involved
property taken during the civil war. That we fail to find an effect on dispute resolution after
three years may reflect the fact that there were fewer of these serious longstanding disputes

left to resolve.
We do, however, see evidence of a large long-term reduction in hostility and violence
associated with land disputes. At both endlines, roughly half of all land disputes involved
threats, destruction of property, or interpersonal violence. After one year, respondents in
treatment communities were 1 percentage point less likely to report a dispute involving
threats or violence (an 8% decrease relative to the control group), but this decline was not
statistically significant. Conditional on a dispute, there was some evidence of a significant
decline in property destruction, but effects on one subcategory of violence have to be taken
with caution.
Three years after the intervention, treatment effects are larger and more robust. Respondents in treatment communities were 1.2 percentage points (28%) less likely to report any
threats or violence. Conditional on having a dispute, respondents were 19 percentage points
(41%) less likely to report threats, property destruction, or interpersonal violence, and 9
percentage points (37%) less likely to report property destruction or interpersonal violence.
We see substantial proportional reductions in all three forms of hostility, though the fall in
interpersonal violence alone is not statistically significant.

Land, money, and interpersonal disputes We observe similar patterns looking at
land, money, and interpersonal disputes together, in Table 2. After one year, 30% of control
community respondents reported at least one of these disputes. We see roughly the same
number of disputes after three years, though this may be due to our inclusion of a much more
detailed measure of domestic disputes in the 3-year endline. At 1-year endline, respondents in
treatment communities were 2 percentage points more likely to report a dispute, an increase
of 7% relative to the control group, though this difference was not statistically significant.
Disputants in treatment communities were also 5 percentage points (7.5%) more likely to
report a resolution. After three years, as with land disputes, we see no statistically significant
increase in disputes or resolutions.
We do, however, see a long-run reduction in dispute severity. After three years, one-third
of disputes in control communities involved property destruction or interpersonal violence;
in treatment communities, this proportion dropped by almost 7 percentage points—a 21%
decline relative to control.

Land security and investment

We found no evidence that the ADR campaign increased investment or improved security
of property rights at the 1-year endline, and hypothesized that not enough time had passed
for community members to realize these benefits. At the 3-year endline, we measured four

dimensions of property rights: inheritance, alienation, collateralization, and demarcation.
We measured respondents’ beliefs about their ability to exercise each of these rights over a
particular plot of land.8 We also collected data on farm size, willingness to leave farmland
fallow,9 capital improvements (such as fences, gutters, and grass), and money and time spent
on improvements. We use these measures to construct standardized indices of security rights,
improvements, and fallowing, as well as a measure of farm size.
Table 3 reports results, which are mixed. On the one hand, treatment community residents reported farm plots 2.75 acres larger than the control community average.10 On the
other hand, when we consider farm and house plots together, we find that plots in treatment
communities score .08 standard deviations lower on our index of security rights. Respondents in treatment communities also scored almost .065 standard deviations lower on our
improvement index. In particular, treatment community respondents reported being less
certain that their property boundaries will not be overstepped, and less certain that they
can extend inheritance rights to people of their choosing. These results run counter to our
expectations. Respondents report weak property rights overall, and the treatment appears
to have weakened them further.
8
We asked respondents to identify their “most important” house plot within the community, their most
important farm plot, and any other plots with disputes associated with them. Very few respondents reported
more than one dispute, and the majority of disputes took place on the most important house or farm plot.
9
The ability to fallow is one dimension of tenure security in this context (Goldstein and Udry 2008).
10
Our average plot sizes are large for the region, but we ask respondents about the size of their plot, rather
than the area under cultivation, so as to include land acquired as an investment.

6.3

Heterogeneity in land security by political connections

What explains these apparently adverse effects? As discussed above and in our previous
study, informal institutions might favor the powerful, and strengthening them might benefit
those who already occupy privileged positions. If this is the case, then the declines in security
and property improvements should be concentrated among those with the least power in their
communities.
To explore this possibility, Table 4 reports three separate heterogeneity analyses, interacting treatment with three measures of status related to land:
1. An indicator for strong political connections (measured as a kin relationship with the
town chief),
2. An indicator for market-based ownership of the plot (i.e. whether the respondent
acquired ownership through a market transaction, which tends to endow stronger rights
than customary allocation), and
3. An indicator for owning land, rather than renting or borrowing.
We measured these variables with the intention of studying heterogeneity, but they were not
pre-specified. Hence we must interpret results with some caution.
With that caveat in mind, treatment effects on security rights do appear to depend on
status. With the addition of the interaction terms above, the coefficient on the treatment
indicator is now interpreted as the effect on the low-powered, and the coefficient on the interaction term is the difference between the low and high-powered. Thus a negative treatment
16

effect and a positive interaction suggests that low-powered individuals bear the brunt of the
decline in property security.
This is generally what we see, though the interaction is not always statistically significant.
The fall in security rights is concentrated among politically unconnected individuals, those
without market-based tenure, and those who do not own their land (columns 1, 4, and 7).
The effects on security rights are null among residents with political connections, those with
market-based tenure, and those who own their land (columns 3, 6, and 9).
The other results are more mixed. Relative to control, all treatment community residents
were less likely to make improvements to their plots, regardless of their status (though these
effects are generally not statistically significant, and generally not statistically different between higher and lower status individuals). And all treatment group residents had larger
farm plots relative to control, though this effect is more pronounced among politically connected individuals (column 3) and those with market tenure (column 6). Interestingly, this
effect is also more pronounced among those who do not own their land (column 7), perhaps
because renting land is less expensive than buying.

6.4

Norms, attitudes and skills

To better understand how the ADR campaign worked, we asked respondents about their
experiences and perspectives on informal dispute resolution as it was taught during the intervention. We focused on: (i) descriptive dispute resolution norms in the community, such
as whether it is the norm for people to try to resolve disputes directly with the other party
before involving outside authorities; (ii) respondents’ attitudes toward these norms, such
as their opinion of resolving a dispute directly with the other party; and (iii) respondents’
dispute resolution skills, such as whether they tried to resolve a dispute directly with another party in the last year. Survey questions for measuring these outcomes were developed
after extensive study of dispute resolution practices in treatment and control communities.
(Hartman 2015).
Table 5 reports effects on indices of these norms, attitudes, and skills. Each index contains
between five and 10 survey questions, grouped thematically and added and standardized to
have zero mean and unit standard deviation. More positive values indicate greater alignment
with the messages of the training. For example, more positive values on the defection index
indicate greater alignment with the norm that disputants should abide by the bargains they
reach. We look at leader responses as well as responses from the sample of community
members.
In general, we observe little change in these norms, attitudes, and skills. We find some

suggestive evidence that norms around mediation are actually weaker in treatment communities, though this effect is only marginally statistically significant. We do, however, find more
robust evidence that treatment community residents internalized norms around managing
emotions and avoiding violence. While we must treat these results with caustion, as they
will be sensitive to multiple comparisons corrections, they are consistent with our finding
that the program did not reduce the incidence, length, or resolution of disputes in the long
term, but that it did reduce the prevalence of violence associated with them.

6.5

Community-level disputes

Table 6 reports impacts on community-level disputes. After one year, the ADR campaign led
to increases in witch hunts and disputes between elders and youths. Youth-elder disputes
increased by almost 40% (or 4 percentage points) over the control group mean of 11%.
18

More striking, witch hunts nearly doubled, from 1.5% to 3.8%—an increase of 153%. In our
previous study we interpreted this as troubling evidence that greater informality can have
the unintended consequence of encouraging communities to adjudicate disputes outside the
bounds of the law. These two effects together drove a 19% (8.5 percentage point) increase
in the prevalence of any violence at the community-level.
These effects did not endure over time. The difference in community-level disputes between treatment and control communities is no longer significant after three years. If anything, in most cases disputes declined (though most of these results are not statistically
significant). For example, incidents of intertribal violence, already a rare event, fell by 1.6
percentage points (78%) in treatment communities. Witch hunts fell by .1 percentage point
(72%) in treatment communities as well. We view this latter result as especially important
given the spike in witch hunts after one year.
On the other hand, violent strikes and protests increased by 1.6 percentage points, which
represents a substantively huge (albeit only marginally statistically significant) 912% increase
over the control group mean. Peaceful strikes and protests increased as well, though not
statistically significantly. It is possible that the program induced treatment communities
residents to be more proactive in protesting actions they disapproved of—even violently.11
But this is speculative, and ultimately we cannot be sure. Whatever the explanation, these
community-level results suggest that the potential for adverse effects continues to be a serious
concern, even as individual-level disputes around land, money, and other interpersonal issues
become increasingly peaceful over time.

6.6

Aggregate impacts

How much violence did the program actually reduce, and at what cost? We can approximate
the aggregate impact on violence by multiplying our treatment effects at each endline by
the roughly 30,000 households living in the 86 treatment communities. We do not have
an estimate for the year between the two endlines, but can interpolate that gap year by
multiplying the total disputes by 1.5.12
11

Our qualitative work suggests that protests in rural Liberian communities often target unpopular decisions by local leaders (such as levying a local fee or tax or implementing a community labour requirement)
or the actions of foreign companies extracting natural resources, or are related to friction between ethnoreligious groups or frustration with government’s lack of progress in resolving criminal cases.
12
The census suggests these 86 communities have roughly 240,000 residents in total, and the survey
respondents report an average houshehold size of 8. As an alternative to this simple back-of-the-envelope
method, we can also perform a weighted comparison of the number of conflicts reported in treatment and
control communities, where each observation is weighted to account for the fact that (1) the fraction of the
population surveyed varied across communities; (2) some communities were dropped from the 3-year endline;
and (3) survey questions about conflicts in the past year refer to different periods of time, depending on
when the survey was conducted. We obtain roughly similar results, and thus opt for the simpler and more

Table 7 reports our results. These are conservative estimates in the sense that we only
know if at least one dispute resulted in a violent act. We do not know if more than one
violent act of the same type occurred, and these aggregate effects assume they do not. Also,
we interviewed one adult per household, about all household disputes. But households had
8 members on average, with multiple adults, and to the extent that the respondent forgot or
was not aware of a brother’s, spouse’s or parent’s dispute, they may underreport violence.
We estimate that the program resulted in 671 fewer angry threats and 805 fewer disputes
with property destruction or interpersonal violence. If we treat property destruction and
interpersonal violence as separate incidents, we estimate that the program led to 1,269 fewer
acts of violence (excluding threats). The program cost $1.2 million to implement in all
86 villages.13 This transaltes to a cost of $946 for every act of property destruction or
interpersonal violence. This is more than twice Liberia’s income per capita. Even if lives
are saved, this is likely to be considerably more expensive than other potentially life-saving
foreign aid investments.

Discussion and conclusions

Like most developing or fragile states, property and other kinds of disputes are endemic in
rural Liberia. A large number of these involve incidents of low-level violence, with a smaller
number escalating from there. We find that a relatively short but intensive mass education
program died not affect the prevalence of disputes, but did reduce the likelihood of violence
associated with them. These effects last at least three years, suggesting that negotiation and
mediation behavior are malleable over the long term.
On the one hand this is an impressive feat of social engineering. We began this study
optimistic about ADR’s potential to solve bargaining problems, but skeptical of the elitedriven, “push” approach to behavior change chosen by the implementers. Somewhat to our
surprise, our results suggest that a push approach can yield a lasting reduction in violence
over time, perhaps through changes in norms, attitudes, and skills related to emotional
regulation and the appropriateness of violence.
Improving formal justice systems in weak states is slow and challenging. Our findings
point to a potentially replicable strategy for reducing the risks and costs associated with
small-scale disputes through mass education and ADR outside the formal sector. The program we evaluate was expensive to deliver, but lower-cost alternatives may be feasible, and
transparent method reported here.
13
This includes all adminstrative costs, all expenses lost to the delays, and many of the start-up costs
associated with scaling this program for the first time. Scaling further could create economies of scale.
Hence the $1.2 million cost is conservative as a cost denominator.

21

are worth exploring. Radio, television, primary and secondary school curricula, and other
mass media could bring the technology of ADR to a much wider community.
On the other hand, social engineering may have unintended consequences. After one year,
we found that the intervention increased reliance on extrajudicial punishment, particularly
witch hunts and trial by ordeal. While these effects decayed over time, we find evidence
of other adverse consequences in the long term, including an increase in violent strikes and
protests. Strengthening informal institutions also seems to have secured the property rights
of some over others, resulting in a net decrease in security of property rights in treatment
communities.
This result is not entirely surprising. Political power structures property rights (e.g.
Goldstein and Udry 2008; Boone 2014), and it is unsurprising that the program failed to
change political power structures at the local level. But this finding has important implications for development and humanitarian programs that seek sustainability by building on
existing rules, norms, and practices. Given that these existing systems may disadvantage certain groups, such interventions may have perverse effects. Further work is needed to evaluate
the cost and desirability of shifting local power structures towards greater inclusivity.
Our results have important implications for the study of conflict as well. Non-cooperative
bargaining theory is one of the most common frameworks for understanding conflict crossnationally. We show that a theory originally intended to explain interstate wars can be
usefully applied to interpersonal disputes as well. Further research on micro-level bargaining
breakdowns, both rational and irrational, strikes us as an important and under-explored
frontier.
Finally, our study demonstrates the benefits of testing the long-term effects of interventions of this sort. These interventions are cost- and labor-intensive, and aim to deliver
large-scale changes that may not be immediately detectable. Yet most evaluations assess
only short-term effects, generating little knowledge about whether such investments lead to
persistent change. Finding cost-effective ways to assess the long-term impact of programs,
successful or not, will help to produce clearer guidance on how best to invest in durable
change.

A.1

Random route sampling method

We sampled survey respondents using the random route method. Typically there is no
village census from which to sample in rural Liberia. Thus interviewers were assigned a
starting location (the center of the village, or the center of a town quarter in larger towns)
and provided with a set of random walking rules: to spin a pen to select a direction, to
use a paper-based random number generator to choose house number n, to select the nth
house in that direction for a survey, and to select an adult in that household to interview
at random. This does not produce a representative sample of the community, but it does
sample community members similarly across the treatment arms.

A.2

Descriptive statistics and balance test

Table A.1 reports means for a selection of 41 baseline covariates by experimental assignment.
For the most part, background attributes appear balanced across experimental conditions.
There are some minor differences between treatment and control communities: 3 of the 41
mean differences (7%) have p < .1. Overall the imbalance is consistent with chance and is
robust to alternative balance tests.

A.3

Intent-to-treat effects for intense treatment

Here we explore the effect of intense treatment on our outcomes of interest. Recall that 16
of the 85 treatment communities received an intense treatment of 30-40% more workshops.
Table A.2 reports impacts by intensity. At the 1-year endline we saw little effect of treatment
intensity on our main outcomes of interest. At the 3-year endline we find that intense
treatment leads to a reduction in treatment respondents reporting threats or violence.

A.4

Heterogeneous treatment effects

Table A.3 reports heterogeneous treatment effects on land disputes and resolution along
gender, age, wealth, religion, ethnicity, prior (pre-treatment) exposure to peace education,
and current (post-treatment) membership in a peace group. In general, we see little evidence
of treatment effect heterogeneity. The most obvious exception is that the program appears

Component variables for norms, attitudes and skills
indices

We used a battery of 49 survey questions to measure attitudes, skills and norms. We organize
these questions into six thematic areas: (1) Bias, (2) Defection, (3) Forum Choice, (4)
Managing Emotions and Avoiding Violence, (5) Mediation, and (6) Negotiation. These
six categories reflect core areas of the ADR curriculum used during the intervention. We
formulated questions on attitudes to identify the respondent’s opinion about a particular
behavior (for example: Do you think that it is good idea to ask friends for help when resolving
a dispute?). For questions that focused on skills, we asked whether respondents actually
practiced a specific behavior themselves (for example: Do you help to cool other people’s
temper during a dispute?). Finally, for questions that covered descriptive norms, we asked
questions about community behavior, not specifically about the respondent (for example:
In this community do people take sides during disputes because one of the parties is their
friend?).
