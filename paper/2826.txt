THE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS OF INFLATION
ON HOUSING CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENT

ABSTRACT

In a mean-variance portfolio choice model, each of 3,578 households
from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances has calculated preferences over
housing, other consumption, and risk.

Each household is constrained such

that any owner-occupied housing in portfolio must match housing services
consumed.

Corporate taxes are modeled in some detail, and regression

coefficients are used to estimate the adjusted gross income, itemizable
deductions, and statutory marginal tax rate of each household.
General equilibrium simulation results indicate that inflation does not
necessarily increase total owner housing.

Top-bracket households increase

their owner housing, while others switch into bonds.

The greater number of

households in low-brackets implies that the homeownership rate can fall even

if the amount of owner housing rises.

The General Equilibrium Effects of Inflation
on Housing Consumption and Investment
James Berkovec and Don Fullerton1

Traditional models of housing and taxation find that inflation raises
the cost of business capital, reduces the cost of homeownership, and shifts
capital toward owner-occupied housing.

Results froa theoretical (Feldstein,

1982) and econometric (Summers, 1981) models suggest that inflation raises
the net return to housing.

In a general equilibrium model with multiple

consumers, Hendershott and Hu (1983) simulate the amount of the shift toward
houaing.

In a partial equilibrium model with housing supply, Poterba (1984)

finds that a large fraction of housing price appreciation can be explained

by its preferential tax treatment with inflation.
In general, the cost of business capital rises because of historical
cost depreciation, FIFO inventory accounting, and the taxation of nominal
capital gains.

The cost of housing falls, essentially because nominal

interest payments are deducted while capital gains are untaxed.

In this paper, we show that these conclusions do not necessarily hold.
We use a very disaggregate general equilibrium model of household portfolio
choice.

Inflation does not raise the cost of business capital in this

model, deapite nominal depreciation and capital gains taxes, because the
greater interest deductions at the 46 percent corporate rate outweigh the
combined taxation of household nominal interest receipts.

In the "open

economy" model, where the real interest rate is fixed by international flows

of debt, inflation actually reduces the net cost of funds and thus the
corporate cost of capital.

High tax brackets are still encouraged to own

housing, but low brackets shift into bonds.

Aggregate housing does

increase with inflation in this model.
The model assumes perfect markets in a single period with fixed labor,
fixed wealth, constant returns to scale production, and no excess profits.

It makes four important contributions, however.

First, any owner-occupied

housing in a portfolio is constrained to match that household's consumption

of housing services in utility.

Second, rather than rely on 10 or 20

"representative" consumers, we calculate preference parameters for each of
3,578 observations from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances and evaluate
supplies and demands for each household at each trial price vector.

Third,

we integrate econometric estimation of parameters with calibration methods
that insure overall consistency of the benchmark equilibrium.

Fourth, we

model the actual 1983 tax law including detailed provisions of the corporate
tax system, estimation of each household's adjusted gross income, endogenous
decisions to itemize deductions, determination of each household's tax
bracket at each iteration, and calculation of tax paid from the schedule.
These contributions turn out to be important for our results.

In the

"closed economy" version of our model, inflation helps the poor by raising
the real interest rate and hurts the rich by reducing their real after-tax
returns.

The sama relative effects appear in the "open economy" version.

Also, tenure choice in our logit model is determined primarily by income and
taxes and
demographic factors, while the amount of housing is affetted by
relative returns.

This distinction is important for an increase in the rate

of inflation, because the greater number of households in low tax bracketa
causes a slight decrease in the total number of owner-occupants, while the
increase in the total
greater wealth in high tax brackets leads to a slight
amount of owner housing.

The Treasury was able to run 24 OLS

regressions for us, using the 20 selected variables to predict adjuated
gross income after exemptions, and to predict itemizable deductions; for
single, married, and head of household filers; for renters and for owners;

and for both the 1983 law and the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

IT. Results

In the base case, untaxed households earn 10 percent nominal interest
before

5

percent inflation, while top bracket households earn 5 percent

after-tax before 5 percent inflation (for a zero real net return).

Still,

owner housing constitutes the largest asaet for all income groups up to the
top ($200,000/year) group, which holds more equity and rental housing.
Table 1 shows selected results from the closed economy model where the
5 percent inflation was changed to zero or 10 percent, with no other changes

in parameters or tax rules. These simulations give some indication of the
effects of inflation through a given tax system, and the zero inflation
simulations indicate the effects of a policy change to complete indexation.

Most results are expressed as ratios of the simulated value to the base
value, so the first row indicates that no inflation (or full indexation)
would reduce the real interest rate received by untaxed households by 45
percent, and that an increaae from S to 10 percent inflation would increase
their real return by 57 percent.

Since untaxed households receive the

actual market returns which are shown at the bottom of the table, these
percentages correspond to real interest rates of .0275,

.05, and .0796, for

inflation rates of zero, 5, and 10 percent, respectively.

Since inflation

increases the real return to debt without a big effect on other assets, it
increases the capital income and utility of low—bracket households.

-8-

At the other end of the income scale, inflation reduces the reel net
interest rate from .014 at no inflation to

-

.010 at 10 percent inflation.

The table shows that the real net rate of return for top-bracket households
falls for all four assets (but it falls least for owner-occupied housing).
Inflation reduces their capital income and utility.

Thus the first general

result we wish to emphasize is that moderate inflation seems to have a
progressive effect in the redistribution of capital income.

(The wage rate

does not change very much, but we have not modeled other effects such as
sticky wages, trensfers, or prices.)

In the closed economy model, the effect of inflation on the nominal
interest rate (3i/Dir) must be greater than one in order to maintain a real
after-tax interest rate.

Empirical estimates suggest that interest rates

rise only point-for-point with inflation, however.

To capture this

alternative, we model a stylized "open" economy where the real interest rate
is fixed at 5 percent by international flows of debt (Hansaon and Stuart,
1986).

Equity and housing returns still vary, as they must be owned

domestically.

Our first result about the progressive effect of inflation is

also clear in the open economy version of our model.
The bottom of the table for the closed economy indicates thst inflation
raises the corporate cost of capital
(r0) only slightly.

We capture the

effect of historical cost depreciation, but this effect was over-estimated
in models with only depreciable assatg such as equipment and structures.
The weight on these assets is reduced here by the addition of inventories,
land, and intangibles.

We use only LIFO inventory accounting, assuming that

firma would minimize taxes, and we include the taxation of purely nominal
capital gains.

In this model, these tax-increasing effects of inflation are

almost completely offset by the tax-reducing effect that nominal interest is

-9-

deducted at the corporation's 46 percent rate and included by households at

much lower rates. If firms were allowed to increase their debt/equity ratio,
we might expect the cost of capital to fall.

In the open economy model,

fixed real interest rates mean that inflation actually reduces the cost of
finance and cost of capital. Thus our second general point is that inflation
does not necessarily raise the cost of business capital.

It does not even

increase the relative return to homeowning for low-tax brackets, although it
does increase the relative return to homeowning for high-tax brackets.
The middle part of the table indicates that untaxed households nearly
eliminate their interest bearing assets at no inflation, and double them at

high inflation.
inflation.

Equity and rental holdings are reduced the most at high

Because of the incentive to hold bonds, the number of homeowners

in this bracket falls by 4 percent while the amount of owner housing falls
by 9 percent.

Thus low-income groups do not experience the incentive

effects of inflation discussed for high-bracket groups in most of the
literature.

Whether inflation increases owner housing becomes an empirical

question that depends on the relative number and wealth of households in
each tax situation.

It also becomes important

to measure

carefully the

actual marginal tax rates they face.
Our model includes 3,578 weighted individual households, each with
specific asset holdings, adjusted gross income, and marginal tax rate.

We

cannot show disaggregate results here, but the table shows the two extremes.

In the 50 percent marginal rate bracket, when inflation reduces all real net
returns except that of owner housing, households reduce bond holdings
dramatically.

They would like to switch most capital into owner housing as

an asset, but they are constrained in this model to consume an equal amount
of housing services.

This constraint turns out to be important, because it

-10-

limits the high-bracket shift into owner housing.

Thus they add more rental

housing to portfolios and increase owner housing by only 15 percent (when
inflation increases to 10 percent).

The next part of the table indicates

that low and high tax brackets offset each other in such a way that none of
the four assets changes much in total.
emphasize is that inflation does
housing in this model.

The third general point we wish to

increase

the capital allocated to owner

However, it does increase owner housing by 10

percent in the open economy version of our model.

Our estimation of the logit model reveals that households are more
likely to shift in and out of equity or rental housing than they are to
shift in and out of homeownership.

As might be expected, income and

demographic characteristics are the major determinants of tenure choice.
The fourth main point of our paper, revealed in the table, is that taxes

have a small effect on homeownership rates but more effect on housing per
owner (but housing prices are held fixed in this model).

This distinction

is missed by Rosen and Rosen (1980) and others who estimate the effect of
relative price changes on homeownership rates only.
Finally, our model emphasizes the importance of using individual
households and their separate amounts of wealth.

When inflation increases

from 5 to 10 percent, low-bracket households shift out of owner housing
while high-bracket households shift into owner housing.

The sheer number of

low-bracket households causes a decrease in the total number of owners,
while the wealth of the high-bracket households leads to a slight increaso

in the amount of owner housing.
