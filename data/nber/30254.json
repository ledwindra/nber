    "abstract": "\n\nI review the key issues that arise in financing health care delivery. I begin by documenting the key features of health care markets that make financing so central in this sector, such as the skewed and unpredictable nature of health care spending and market failures in health care delivery. I then review the key issues that public and private payers face in designing health care markets, from the proper mix of public and private provision to the role of risk bearing for consumers and providers. Finally, I illustrate how these issues manifest in practice by comparing the design of insurance systems in the United States and Canada.\n\n",
