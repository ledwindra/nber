JOB MOBILITY AND THE CAREERS OF YOUNG MEN

ABSTRACT

study the joint processes of job mobility and wage growth among young men
drawn from the LongitudinalEmployee-EmployerData. Following individuals at three
month intervals from their entry into the labor market, we track career patterns of
job changing and the evolution of wages for up to 15 years. Following an initial
period of weak attachment to both the labor force and particular employers, careers
tend to stabilize in the sense of strong labor force attachmentand increasing
durability of jobs. During the first 10 years in the labor market, a typical young
worker will work for seven employers, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
total number of jobs he will hold in his career. The evolution of wages plays a key
role in this transition to stable employment: we estimate that wage gains at job
changes account for at least a third of early-career wage growth,and that the wage is
the key determinant of job changing decisions among young workers. We conclude that

The wastefulness of this "try and try again" process of advancing to a better position
is self-evident. The worker does not know in detail the nature of the job which he is
obtaining nor does he know his own capacities. Nevertheless it is the principal method
by which workers at the present time improve their condition on their own initiative.
Sumner H. Slichter, 1919, p. 218.
1. Introductiou
New entrants to the labor force can look forward to about 40 years of work. Over

their careers their wages will about double (in the cross-section) and they will change jobs
ten times. But the pace

of these changes is far from even. The first ten years of a career

will account for 66 percent of lifetime wage growth for male high school graduates and
almost exactly the same fraction of lifetime job changes. As the career progresses both
turnover and wage growth subside.1

In this paper we ask

how these features

of the early career,

high turnover and

rapid wage growth, are related. That the two should coincide during the beginning of the
career is not surprising. Tenuous attachment to both the labor force, and to any given
employer,

is

combined with rapidly growing generalized work experience among young

workers. Most modern theories of job mobility attach a structural interpretation to the
process of job change and wage growth (Burdett, 1978; Jovanovic, 1979b). In particular,
models of job change offer an addition to the traditional schooling and training explanations

for why earnings rise with experience.

Investments here take the form

of learning about

one's comparative advantage by sampling and experiencing a variety of jobs; that wages

should grow as an outcome of this process is an observation traceable to Stigler's (1962)
seminal article.

The most prominent and widely documented facts about labor mobility are that
average rates

of job changing decline with age or experience and, especially, with current

'Hall (1982) estimates the number of lifetime jobs; Murphy and Welch (1988)
estimate the structure of wage growth over the career.

job tenure (duration).2 When changing jobs, the wages of young people increase, but these
gains decline with age (Bartel and Borjas,

1981;

Mincer, 1986). Most theories of turnover

are designed to accommodate these crude facts, though they differ in fundamental details.
Nonbehavioral models have the longest history (Blumen, Kogen, and McCarthy, 1955;
Singer and Spilerman, 1976). The key idea is that individuals may differ for unobservable
reasons in their propensities to leave a job. This presence of movers' and stayers in
turnover data implies that observed job duration acts as a filter, selecting individuals who
have low probabilities of terminating a worker-firm pairing. Thus a tabulation of the
frequency of mobility will show a negative relationship between the probability of leaving a
job and its current duration, though for any individual the probability of leaving may be
independent of tenure.

If "stayers" are fertile for firm-specific training, while "movers"

are not, then average earnings will rise faster within a job than between jobs.

A related source of heterogeneity is generated in optimizing models of individual
search for a good employment match (e.g., Jovanovic 1979b). Following the terminology of
Nelson (1974), suppose that jobs are pure search goods, the quality (productivity) of any
worker-firm pairing being known upon initial inspection. Rational search then implies that
good pairings are more likely to survive. This source of heterogeneity may also bias
inferences about the relation of job duration to mobility, though the direction

of bias

depends on details of the search technology in this case.3 Mobility will also decline with
time in the labor market for purely statistical reasons: given some process by which job
offers are generated, the expected value of the maximum offer received (the current job) is
higher for workers who have searched longer (Burdett, 1978). For exactly the same reason,

2e Mincer and Jovanovic (1981) and Parsons (1978).
3mough good matches tend to survive, persons with low tenure in survey data are
well matched by virtue of the fact that they have recently accepted a new job. In general,
this bias means that tabulations of the frequency of mobility based on survey data will
understate any negative relation between mobility and tenure (Topel, 1986).

4
earnings grow with labor market experience as a return to search, even without accumulation of general training. A key issue addressed below is the extent to which this type of
matching process is descriptive of actual careers.

In contrast to these models where the
zero, the probability that an individual

true effect

changes jobs

of tenure on mobility may be

will decline with tenure if either job-

specific human capital or information about the quality of a match accumulates with time on

the job. Suppose that jobs are like 'experience goods,' in that a worker learns about match
quality by observing his productivity over time (Jovanovic, l979a). Uncertainty about the
true quality of a match declines with tenure, and poor matches are more likely to end. A
key difference is that survivors have learned that they are well matched, so that their own

probabilities of moving have declined with tenure after some critical amount of information
has accumulated.4 At the extreme where there is no cx ante information about the quality

of a new job, jobs during a worker's career form a renewal process and mobility (and
earnings) is independent of time in the market (experience), holding current job duration
constant.

-

None

of these extreme models of labor turnover is

likely to completely describe

mobility data and earnings dynamics. Yet except under extreme circumstances, they are
observationally equivalent in data on job durations alone. This suggests that additional
information on the productivities of particular job pairings may provide important identifying
leverage for distinguishing the importance of competing theories.
Our analysis of these issues is based on the Longitudinal Employee-Employer Data
(LEED) file—-a large sample of individual labor market histories taken from Social Security
earnings records. The observability of job specific wages, in conjunction with the long

4jovanovic (l979a) demonstrates that the probability of leaving a new job may
initially rise with tenure in this case. The reason is that it pays to remain and collect
information on a new job, especially if cx ante information is scarce. Eventually, however,
the probability of changing jobs must decline with tenure.

5
panel aspects and size of the LEED file provides important information

for distinguishing

among models of job mobility and earnings growth. Using these data, we follow
approximately 10,000 young men from entry into the labor market, and we observe up to

15

years of quarterly post-entry labor market experience. Because we observe careers from
their inception, common issues of "left censoring" of labor market histories do not arise.
The data are unique in that their basis in administrative records allows us to view fast
turnover jobs and transitions between them with a fidelity that is absent in all self-reported
longitudinal samples, while closely tracking the evolution of wages within careers.
The paper

is

organized as follows. The next section describes patterns of job

mobility and labor force attachment among recent entrants to the labor force. The data
indicate that job attachments after entry are extremely fragile: two—thirds of all new jobs
among young workers end in the first year, with both transitions to new employers and exit
from the labor force playing important roles. The importance of job-to-job transitions as a
source of turnover increases with experience, and jobs become more durable as the career
progresses.

The typical young worker holds seven full-time jobs during his first ten years

in the labor.market. Section 3 relates this evidence of intense job shopping to early career
wage growth. Wages grow extremely rapidly during this career phase, averaging over eleven
percent annually in the period of our data. Wage gains at job changes average about 10
percent, and account for about one third of total wage growth during the first ten years in
the market. We also find that the evolution of wages within jobs closely approximates a
random walk, so that the wage, conditioned on market experience and tenure, is a sufficient
statistic for the value of a job.
We follow this evidence with

an explicit model of mobility decisions that emphasizes

both the evolution of wages within jobs and the arrival of external offers in affecting
mobility. The main empirical result is that the job—specific wage is a key determinant of
mobility controlling for individual heterogeneity, a ten percent within—career increase in

6
the wage reduces the probability of changing jobs by about 20 percent, and jobs with more

rapid wage growth are also more stable. This connection between the evolution of wages
and job changing behavior is strong evidence in favor of job shopping as a determinant of
mobility and early career development.
The epigraph, taken from Slichter's dissertation, reflects a view that has all but
disappeared from contemporary discussion of the mobility process.5 He deplored the high
rate of turnover that he observed among young factory workers as a hinderence to career
development and an important contributor to the idleness of nonhuman capital.6 In
contrast, our evidence is that the process of job changing among young workers, while
apparantly haphazard,

is

a critical phase in workers' move toward the long-term, stable

employment relations that characterize mature careers.

2. Job Mobility Among Young Men
A. The Data

Our data source is the LEED, the longitudinal employee-employer data. The
complete LEED file contains quarterly employee-employer records

for over one million

individuals, including Social Security earnings credited to the worker's account from each
51t is still the case, however, that frequent job change may inhibit investment in
firm—specific human capital and contribute to flatter wage growth profiles (Mincer and
Jovanovic, 1981). Our point is that frequent job change is the rule rather than the
exception and that wage growth may well be accommodated rather than hindered by the
process.

6Reynolds (1951), in his careful study of the work history of manual workers in
New Haven in the 1940s, was the first to coin the term "job shopping" in his description of
the early years in the labor market. (See also Ginsberg, 1951.) Parnes (1954), in a
comprehensive review of exisiting studies of labor mobility, relates a pessimistic appraisal of
this mobility as a market mechanism. He concludes, for example, that workers rarely
consider wages or even make job comparisons in deciding on a move (p. 188) and that
manual workers only slightly more often than not improve their wages when they change
jobs voluntarily (p. 190). With regard to the mobility differences by age, Parnes emphasized
institutional factors (seniority rules) and maturation in explaining declining turnover with
age.

employer during each quarter, the number of employees in the firm, and the detailed
industry (4-digit SIC) and location (county) of the employer. Each employee and each
employer has a unique identifier in the file. For individuals, information on personal
characteristics is limited to age, race, and sex. The most prominent nonreported items are
the person's schooling and dimensions of labor supply (hours and weeks worked).
The panel begins in the first quarter

of

1957 and ends in 1972. So as to measure

labor market events from the beginning of careers, we selected only individuals who were
born after 1938. Thus the oldest person in the data is

18

in 1957. Because of ambiguities

about the meaning of jobs held while very young, all others have their histories measured
starting with the first job held on or after their eighteenth birthday. Consequently, the
oldest person is 34 years old in 1972, having accumulated 60 quarters of experience during
the panel.8
Among the young men who comprise our sample, multiple job holding, rapid

turn-

over, and return to past employers are common. Transitory jobs and employment spells
followed by a gradual move toward stable employmentcharacterize the prototypical career
sequence. Unfortunately, it is not obvious how one should weight employment experience in
transient jobs, or even how one distinguishes them except cx post. A revealing feature of
the data is that it

In some cases the break is not as dramatic as full-time

schooling models

71n the succeeding empirics the selection criteria are restricted further to illustrate
characteristics of the early career and, later, to enable us to analyze wage change.
8We generated samples of careers starting at age 16 in 1957 (N 8,102) and,
atlernatively, at age 18 (N — 9,919). The samples differed only in that job events before
the respective birth quarters were ignored. The younger sample allowed us to examine labor
force entry and job change prior to age 18 and to study the effect of "left-censoring" of
job histories. We found that rates of job transition were essentially identical for the two
samples. Table I below uses the younger sample while the remaining tables use job histories
which begin on the eighteenth birth quarter. Versions which use the younger sample are
available from the authors on request.

In light

of these facts, our definition of the length of a job

primarily by inspection of the data.

We

define the major employer as the one who

contributes the most to total earnings in a quarter.

We smooth

over periods of part—time or

short-time employment by considering a person to be participating on a full-time basis
he earned

if

at least 70 percent of the minimum quarterly wage during that quarter, assuming

full-time work. This limit

is

gauged against the sum of earnings on all jobs, and only these

quarters of full-time work are used to accumulate measured work experience.9 Quarters in
which the earnings limit

is

not reached are treated as 'nonemployment periods, though

these may actually include employment in the uncovered sector or part-time work. Job
tenure is accumulated continuous quarters with a single employer.10 Finally, we restrict
ourselves to jobs that begin after age 18 (except

for Table, 1).

Jobs in progress at age 18

are measured from age 18.
Two final requirements were imposed on career histories that were selected for
analysis. First because of the possibility that individuals may

enter uncovered employment,

for example the military, we exclude records with continuous nonemployment gaps of two
years or more.' Finally, for our initial tabulations, we require that each record analyzed
9These criteria for accumulating jobs and experience are more stringent than in
other studies of job durations and earnings. For example, using the PSID Cline (1979),
Altonji and Shakotko (1987), and Abraham and Farber (1987) include all individuals with
positive hours during a calendar year. The latter two studies accumulate a year of
experience if an individual reported 100 hours worked during a year. In our data, these
criteria imply increased participation and job changing.
101n case of transitory (one quarter) changes in the identity of the main employer,
we smoothed over the break and treated the employment spell as continuous. This
has the
effect of eliminating terminations due to such factors as temporary layoffs, which we do not
view as a severance of the employmentrelationship.
Results are not materially different when these records are maintained. However,
for such workers it is not clear how to evaluate the accumulation of experience, since
market work is defined by recorded earnings. We took two years to be a reasonable upper

at least six years of potential market experience after initial entry. More stringent

requirements are imposed later. Further details on sample selection are appended.

B. Mobility
All of the following results are based on the occurrence or termination of a
worker-firm pairing as identifiable events, ignoring such subcategories as geographic or
sectoral mobility for which these data are also suited. We confine the analysis to white
males, of which there are 9,919 individuals with 58,181 full-time jobs in our data. Table 1

labor force attachment, which we take to depend on the length of the initial employment
spell.12 The data show that over 86 percent of young men have held a substantial job of
some sort by age 20 and over 46 percent by age 18, yet weak attachment to the labor force
is a prime characteristic of new entrants: the distribution of first employment spells lasting
limit on nonparticipation.

fourth row of the table) may include many individual jobs. For this table only, we consider
jobs which begin as early as age 16.

l0
a

year or more is shifted sharply to the right relative to the age distribution of first

employment. Only about 20 percent of spells lasting a year or more occur by age 18,
implying that early spells are likely to end with a transition to nonemployment.
These tabulations suggest that young individuals spend a significant portion of their
post-entry, potential labor force time without a job. To illustrate, table 2 exploits the
panel aspects of the data, showing the distribution of actual labor force experience for a

of individuals with exactly ten years of potential experience (years since first entry),
and also the rate at which experience accumulates post-entry. Panel A of the table shows
sample

that only 16.2 percent of these workers are continuously employed over the first ten years

of their careers, and only 44 percent have spent less than one cumulative year without a
job. Nevertheless, panel B shows that the distribution of nonemployment time is heavily
skewed toward the earliest part
nearly one-fourth

of careers.

During the first few years in the market,

of potential market time is spent without a job.

The rate

at which actual

experience accumulates accelerates rapidly, however, so that strong labor force attachment
is

the rule after five or six years.
In

part this weak attachment to the

labor force reflects summer employment and

other temporary or part-time jobs among persons in school, as well as transition between
school and full-time work. We see now reason to exclude this type

of employment spell,

either in terms of accumulated experience or the job shopping process. Yet

it is important

to realize that school would be the main activity of only a small portion of individuals in
these data only 58 percent

of the potential high school

class

of 1958 actually graduated,

and only 30 percent of these graduates went on to attend college.13 Thus less than 18

their major activity as school in 1970, 57 percent worked fewer that 13 weeks in the
previous calendar year and 21 percent did not work at all (March Current Population
Survey).

percent of the relevant post-18 population would be in school, and a smaller fraction would
meet the entry criteria we impose. Because of this, we view the gradual transition to fulltime participation as a prime characteristic of young workers' careers.
Table 3 shows corresponding data for the accumulation of full-time' jobs. By the
tenth year after entry, more than half of young workers have held six or more jobs, and
over a third have held eight jobs

or more. Only one worker in

ten years. The average number of jobs by this career point

is

20 has held a single job

6.96, which

is

for

slightly higher

than Hall's (1982) estimate for similarly aged workers, which was derived by a far different
sampling procedure.14 Note, however, that

our definitions preclude multiple job holding as

contributing to this Count, so these tabulations underestimate the total number of jobs
actually sampled in the job-shopping process.
Panel B of table

3

reports the flow of new jobs with experience. On average, the

first full year of actual employment is divided among almost three jobs. The average pace
of sampling jobs then declines fairly smoothly as experience accumulates.15 This is our first
real evidence on the sorting process; as experience accumulates, the frequency of job
changing declines. This fact is inconsistent with a pure mover-stayer model, as well as with
the pure "experience goods" version of job matching, in which new jobs within careers
would form a renewal process. If all jobs were identical cx ante, then new jobs would not
be systematically more stable than past ones.

-

Underlyingmanyof these results is a prime feature of mobility data that was
referred to above: the average frequency of job mobility is a declining function of current
job tenure. The strength of this association in the market for young workers is illustrated
'4Hall estimates that workers aged 25-29 have held 5.5 jobs and that workers aged
20-24 have held four. Our estimates for these age ranges are 5.9 and 3.8, respectively.
15Note that the tenth year of actual experience is associated with fewer new jobs
than the tenth year of potential experience. This is due to sample selection: persons who
change jobs frequently have spent more time out of the labor force on average, and so they
are selected Out of the sample of persons with high actual experience.

in figure 1, which shows the conditional relative frequency

of job terminations given current

tenure--the empirical exit-hazard function.'6 The shape of this function is a main
component of the rapid accumulation of jobs among young workers. More than one-third of
all new jot,s among young workers end within three months, and two of every three end
within a year. The probability

of moving declines dramatically over the first year of a job

(by a factor of three), yet even after a full year's tenure more than one-third of all
remaining jobs will end in the next twelve months. After about four years on the job this
annualized probability of job terminations stabilizes at about .20. An alternative
representation

of these data is the expected remaining duration of a job given current

tenure. The estimates imply that a typical new job among young men can

be expected to

last only about 1.5 years, but having reached that point the job can be expected to last an
additional four years.

This high-speed turnover among young workers is not simply an artifact of planned
short periods of participation by new entrants to the labor force. Panel A of table 4
illustrates this fact, showing quarterly mobility functions for various levels of previous fulltime experience at the start of the job. Even after eight full-time years in the market,

half of all new job holders will move again within one year. This estimate may overstate
the extent of mobility for the typical worker, since the fact that a new job has begun after
eight years in the labor market may select individuals who are more likely to move on
subsequent jobs. Even so, the uniform decline in the hazard rate with experience suggests
the importance of job shopping.
Panel B of table 4 shows empirical hazards by number of prior jobs in order to
illustrate a key point about observed mobility and the search process. First, there is a
tendency for mobility to decline as jobs accumulate, except for individuals who have had a

including jobs in progress at age 18.

very large number of prior jobs. The decline is less prominent than in panel A,
mainly concentrated in the first quarter

it is

of new jobs. Thus, while these facts suggest that

later jobs are more stable, they also imply substantial heterogeneity among individuals in
probabilities

of leaving a job. Persons with many prior jobs are also more likely to leave a

new one. This may be because some people are movers, say, due to occupational
differences in specificity

of human capital or because of differencesin job search histories.

For example, if workers search systematically for a productive match, then a sequence of
low-quality prior jobs implies a lower expected quality

of the current job, raising average

turnover in the population of new jobs.

C. Labor Force Attachment and Types of Job Endings

In table

2,

we noted that labor force attachment tends to be weak in the early

phases of careers. Table 5 shows the surprising importance of this fact as

a determinant of

turnover and the unstable jobs of young workers. For workers on their initial jobs, half of
all first-year job endings result in a transition to nonemployment.17 Both the relative and
absolute importance of this transition decline with experience, however, though even among
workers with eight full years of prior experience the proportion who leave new jobs for
nonemployment in the first year is .i5.18 It is impossible for us to tell in these data
whether these high nonemployment' flows represent withdrawals from the labor force or
transitions into unemployment. They are consistent with related evidence on unemployment
flows, which shows that a prime component of higher unemployment rates among young
workers is their vastly higher flows out of jobs (Topel, 1984). A plausible interpretation of
17A transition to a quarter with earnings below 70 percent of the minimum wage.
18Some of this decline may be due to our sample selection criteria. For any fixed
level of labor supply, high-wage workers are less likely to cross the earnings threshold that
determines participation. However, we think this cutoff is sufficiently low that the bias is
not,serious. If anything, we probably understate nonemployment transitions by our method.

14

these facts is that the costs of unemployment (or nonemployment) are relatively low for
young workers, so changes in employment status are frequent.
Note also that the absolute importance of job-to-job transitions rises over the first
few years in the market before turning down, though the total frequency

of job endings

declines throughout. The implied low intensity of search and job sampling during the
earliest phase of market participation
attachment

is

another dimension of the weak labor force

Because we restrict ourselves to

full-timejobs after age

18

the group with zero experience may be anomalous. These are individuals who have never
worked full—time until after their eighteenth birthday.

3. Wage Growth WIthin and Between Jobs
To this point we have ignored the role of job changing as a determinant of wage
growth, yet in terms of theory the connection is obvious. Empirically, profiles of earnings
growth mirror the pattern of early career mobility. For the typical male worker in the
U.S., over two—thirds of total lifecycle earnings growth occurs during the first ten years of
labor market experience (Murphy and Welch, 1988).
We examine two important aspects of the evolution

of earnings for young workers.

First we analyze wage growth within jobs and the time series properties of wage innovations. The data indicate that earnings evolve within jobs as approximately a random walk
with drift. This result is important for our subsequent analysis of workers' mobility
decisions. We follow with direct evidence on the gains from mobility, based on observed
changes in earnings at job transitions. The evidence is that more than

a third of early

career wage growth is associated with job changing, while larger wage gains at transitions
are associated with

a corresponding decline in subsequent mobility)9 Because we

wish to

19These results differ from those of Mincer (1986) and Bartel and Borjas (1982) by
a factor of almost two. They find smaller wage changes at job changes in large part (we
theorize) because of the inability to follow intra-year job and wage changes in the popular

15

track the evolution of wages and jobs over the career, in what follows we restrict attention
to individuals with at least

13

years of potential labor market experience in the panel.

Further, so as to focus on workers with relatively permanent attachments to the labor

force, "entry" is defined to occur when

(i) earnings in a quarter exceed 70

percent of the

minimum wage for full-time work, and (ii) earnings over the subsequent four quarters also
satisfy this criterion.20 There were 872 persons satisfying these requirements, representing
44,089 job-quarters.

so standard regression techniques are inappropriate for (1). Our interest is in the
longitudinal surveys, and because of measurement error in identifying true job changes. In
addition, for the "movers" in these data, recall of past job changes in an interview setting
is understandably incomplete.
20The second condition eliminates individuals whose careers start with summer jobs.
Tabulations of the March CPS indicate that only 17 percent of 19- and 20-year-olds enrolled
in school would meet the second condition on annual earnings.

one year of the current period. We find that more durable jobs offer slightly greater wage

growth--an extra five years of completed tenure raises average annual growth by about

1.5

points--though jobs that will end soon are characterized by lower growth in periods
preceding the end of the job. Both of these effects suggest that the evolution of wages on
a job plays a key role in influencing mobility decisions. Jobs that yield higher wage growth

sample selection. For example,, if low values of
immediately induce mobility, then these
values will be not observed in the sample of individuals who do not change jobs. We
abstract from this type of selection in estimating (2).

22Because wage changes are annual, to be included in the sample a job must have
survived for at least six quarters. This in itself focuses the analysis on relatively stable
jobs. Note that the estimates include aggregate wage growth, so comparison to crosssectional estimates is not appropriate.

from unity.27 This is important, since it implies that a good predictor of future

wages

on a

particular job is the current wage, adjusted for predictable growth due to accumulated
experience and seniority. Past wage changes are not informative. Thus heterogeneity
among jobs in predictable wage growth is not an important feature of the data. In

t imply that about 95

B. Between-Job Wase Growth
The LEED file provides a more complete record

of earnings growth than is available

in other sources of panel data. Yet even with quarterly observations it is difficult to
uniquely assign a quarterly wage to each job. For example, since the beginning and end of
each job are known to occur within particular three-month intervals, recorded earnings
during the first and last periods of a job will not provide valid estimates of the wage.
Because

short jobs are common, it is difficult to reliably track earnings growth associated

with every job change in a worker's career.

27Estimates of the covariance structure of earnings within jobs are rare. Altonji
and Shakotko (1987) discuss the point, but they assume that within-job wage disturbances
are purely transitory. Our results are inconsistent with that assumption. Abowd and Card
(forthcoming) report estimates of the autocovariances of reported earnings and hours
changes for single job spells in the NLS and PSID samples. Their results for earnings are
very similar to ours, though their estimated variances are greater because of greater
measurement error in survey data. We obtain nearly identical parameter estimates to those
in panel C using PSID hourly earnings data.

,

280ne caveat to these results is that sample selection may cause the assumption
0 to be violated. If current innovations to within-job wage offers,
affect
current mobility decisions, then we observe wage outcomes only for individuals who chose
not to change jobs. Wage growth in the sample of stayers will overestimate potential
growth available to a random worker. The estimated residuals from (2) are affected by this
selection bias, which may affect our inferences about the error structure.

one quarter. Consider the transition from job

The last two terms on the right of (4) denote expected wage growth on the new

model reported in row (v) of table 6. Note that by considering only those new jobs that
survive more than one quarter we treat temporary jobs lasting a quarter or less as elements

of a single transition.
Panel A of table 7 reports estimates of wage growth at job transitions during the

first ten years of labor market experience, based on
of wage growth at transitions, broken out by

(4). The

first row shows mean values

change during this career phase is associated with a 12 percent increase in an individual's
quarterly wage, though for experienced workers with 7.5-10 years in the labor market the
average change is only half this large. These estimates should be compared to average

quarterlywage growth within jobs of only

earnings growth during the first ten years of labor market experience is attributable to job
changing activity.
Panel B of table 7 reports estimated determinants

of wage changes at job

transitions. The underlying specifications are the same as for within-job wage growth in
table 6 with two differences. First, since current tenure on the new job is zero, the

between-job change in tenure is just

Second, to pursue the point that completed

job duration is an (endogenous) indicator of the relative quality of the job via mobility
decisions, we include the between—job changein completed tenures as

a regressor.29

As

expected, between-job wage gains decline with experience, and also with prior job tenure.
More importantly, average wage gains are largest in transitions to more durable
jobs: An
increase

of one year in completed job duration is associated with a one percentage point

increase in the initial wage on a new job. Again, since mobility decisions are
endogenous
no causality is implied by this relationship. Yet the relationship suggests that workers'
mobility decisions are strongly affected by the job-specific wage, and that these wage gains

are a key element generating workers' sorting to stable employment relations.

We next

provide a more formal analysis of these decisions.

4. Econometric Evidence on the Job Shopping Process

Our model of mobility decisions is based on wealth maximizing on-the-job search.3°
In light of our preceding evidence we allow job changing decisions to be affected by the
(stochastic) evolution

of wages within a job--which affects the value of remaining with the

current employer--as well as by the arrival of external wage offers from new employers.

29Abraham and Farber (1987) report corresponding results for wage levels.
30For earlier treatments of this problem see Burdett (1978), Jovanovic (1979a,b;
1984), Topel (1986), and Mortensen (forthcoming).

The discussion that follows outlines the main empirical implications of the model. Details
are appended.

A. A Model of Mobility Decisions
We assume

that wage offers from potential new employers are generated by a known

offer distribution. The location of this distribution differs among individuals due to
differences in talent or other characteristics, and it may also shift within a worker's career
as general human capital accumulates. Suppressing individual differences

for the moment,

we account for the latter effect by assuming that the location of the external wage offer
distribution depends on an individual's cumulative labor market experience,

wage growth. Workers would therefore accept

a wage cut to obtain them. Thus,

conditional on the current wage and experience, mobility increases with tenure if expected

on-the-job wage growth is declining.34
33The model can be extendedto allow transitions to nonemployment, which would
lead to a competing risk specification with two types of job endings. Let V(w,X) be the
value of search for a jobless person with nonwage income w. If a within-job wage change
causes V(w,X,T) < V(w,X) then the individual will quit in order to search from nonemployment. Recall that the distinction in our data is only between covered employment and all
alternatives, including employment in the uncovered sector. Thus the extension offers few
additional restrictions in terms of analyzing the data. We therefore focus on a single type
of job ending.
341f workers learn about match quality as tenure accumulates, then the variance of
wage innovations also declines with tenure. Variance increases the option value of the
current job, so the probability of leaving the job increases with tenure in this case as well.

25
The effect of labor market experience on mobility(Sc) is determined by the effect

of experience on the reservation offer and on the distribution of alternatives. If wage
offers grow with experience (Gx(.) < 0) the latter effect is positive. The effect on the
reservationoffer is unsigned because additional experience affects wealth on both the
current and alternative jobs. Note, however, that R(w,

a direct test of the hypothesis that wage

offers rise with experience is that mobility must rise with experience, conditional on current
tenure and the wage.
These predictions for the impact of experience and tenure are the opposites

of what

of job mobility in section 2. There we argued that the

value of the current job tended to increase with both experience and tenure because of
sample selection induced by search and the accumulation of job-specific capital. The key

difference is that the hazard function, (7), controls for the current wage, which theory
implies is a main factor affecting job-changingdecisions. Here the wage, experience, and
tenure are sufficient Statistics for the value of the job.35 Thus a key implication of the
See Jovanovic (1984) or Mortensen (forthcoming).

35This feature of the model is implied by our specification of within-job wage
changes, (6). -It need not hold in alternative models. For example, if investment in jobspecific human capital is endogenous, then incentives to invest will be greater in a good
match. If workers finance investment through reduced initial wages, the connection between
the current wage and the value of the match is broken. Bonding' models of within-job
wage profiles (Lazear, 1981) have the same effect. The brevity of the typical job in our
data, and our finding of no serial correlation in within-job wage growth, suggest that these
models are not important for very young workers.

26

theory is that the unconditional exit hazard may decline in both labor market experience

and current job tenure, as in table 4, but these effects are reversed when mobility decisions
are properly conditioned on the current wage.
A final point is important. Recall that

we suppressed individual differences in

earning capacity when specifying the wage offer distribution, (5). To explicitly account for
these differences, let the offer distribution for person

and the effects of

of changing jobs refer to comparisons between otherwise

or to variations within a person's career. Parameter

p enters as an

unobservable that increases mobility for any values of (w. X. T). A high-p person is more
likely to leave a job for any wage because his offer distribution dominates that of a low-p
person. Therefore, conditioning on the current wage serves to control for job-specific
heterogeneity in match qualities, but the theory also implies a form of mover-stayer'
heterogeneity due to fixed individual differences in mobility decisions. We explicitly account

for the presence of these unobservabtes in estimating the model.36

B. Estimation

Then a cross-sectional comparison of mobility behavior would show a negative relation
between wages and mobility even if there is no effect of the wage on individuals' decisions.

correlated with other observed regressors, the wage in particular. Thus random effects
methods of integrating Out unobservables, which assume orthogonality to observed regressors,
are inappropriate for this model.38 This leaves true fixed effect estimators that treat the

as estimable parameters and that rely directly on the panel aspect of the data. However,
the fixed effect estimator applied to nonlinear models is known to

be biased in

short panels

(Anderson, 1973; Chamberlain, 1980). Thus, an important issue is whether the panel lengths
derivable from the LEED file are long enough that the estimatorcan be applied with
confidence.

is quite small in panels of over eight years.39 To be conservative, as noted

above, we restrictedthe analysis to persons with minimum panel lengths of

restriction. We estimate a separate intercept,

,

for each of these persons,

so

our results

on mobility refer to the effects of changes that occur within individual careers.4° Details

of the likelihood function are appended.
C. Emnirical Results
Before turning to details of parameter estimates, figures 2 and 3 illustrate the shape

of the hazard function (10) when experience and tenure effects are unrestricted by
functional form. In each case, the effects of experience (figure 2) or tenure (figure 3) are
represented by a sequence dummy variables. Because theory predicts that conditioning the
hazard on the current wage will change the effect of experience or tenure on mobility, we

show these effects for models that both include and omit the current wage

as a control

variable.41
391n general the bias causes an underestimate of the importance of negative
duration dependence (3A/8T < 0). In panels of over eight years, this bias was always smaller
than 10 percent. Heckman's (1981) evidence for the fixed effect probit model also showed a
critical panel length of about eight periods, though the critical panel length must depend on
the frequency of the event being studied. Very rare or very common events require longer
panels.
40Tlie estimated individual effects reflect factors that shift the offer distribution, as
above, as well as other unobserved differences that affect mobility but that are fixed within
a person's career.

41Otherregressors for these models are reported in table 8, as are summary
statistics. The dummies for experience are at 0-6 months, 6-12 months, followed by annual
dummies out to 12 years. The tenure dummies are quarterly for four years, after which the
hazard is assumed to be constant.

Figure 2 shows that in the unconditional model mobility declines with experience.42
A

worker with

12 years

of labor market experience is about half as likely to leave a new

job as is a new entrant. This decline conforms with our earlier tabulations. When mobility
is conditioned on the wage, however, this pattern is reverseth wage constant, a worker with
12 years

of experience is three times

as likely to leave to leave his

current job

otherwise identical new entrant. This reversal in the experience profile

of job mobility is

what the theory predicts when wage offers increase with experience. More formally, the
mobility data support the hypotheses of a positive return to search combined with

Figure 3 is

G(.) <

a corresponding plot for the effects of job tenure. Conditioning on

unobserved person effects and other regressors, mobility declines with seniority. Most

of

the decline occurs in the first year of a job, and the hazard is fairly flat beyond this point.

Further, this shape is virtuallyunchanged when the estimates are conditionedon the wage;
it is not even worth identifying which curve conditions on the wage. Unlike the pattern

for experience effects in figure 2, there is no evidence that mobility increases with tenure
when the wage is held constant. In retrospect this may not be surprising: the predicted
sign reversal for experience is a direct implication of human capital growth over the career,
while the prediction for the effect of job tenure relies on concavity of wage growth profiles

on succesive jobs. While these and other data sources favor concavity, the evidence is not
strong among these young workers (see table 6). Even so, if mobility declineswith tenure

42For the estimates in the figure, the model is evaluated at sample means of all
regressors except tenure, which is set to zero for internal consistency (tenure cannot exceed
experience).
431f mobility declined with experience simply because older workers are more stable,
conditioning on the wage would not have the indicated effect. Thus the pattern illustrated
in figure 2 is also evidence that the decline in the unconditional hazard is caused by the
sorting of workers to successively more productive jobs.

30

because of accumulating specific capital reflected in the wage, conditioning on the wage
should eliminate the relationship. It does not.
Table 8 reports parameter estimates for various forms

of (10). For these models,

inspection of the unconstrained estimates led us to specify experience and tenure effects as

three-piece linear splines with break points at one and two years. In accord with the
theory, which requires that the effect of experience

be evaluated

at the beginning of a job,

we also allow for interactions between experience and tenure effects over each of these
intervals. The specifications contain shifters for calendarquarter (summer

872 person-specificintercepts, for which we report the mean and standard deviationof the
estimates. Because of the proportional hazards assumption (10), the parameterestimates in

table S are approximate elasticities of the quarterly probability of leaving a job with respect
to a unit change in the indicated variable.
For reference the model in column (1) omits the wage and interactions between
experience and tenure. In addition to the previously illustrated pattern

of experience and

tenure effects, we find that jobs are more stable in large firms. At means, the turnover
rate in the smallest size class is about double that of the largest class. Since the estimates
account for individual differences in propensities to change jobs, the interpretation is that
transitions from small to large employers result in much more durable employment relations.

There are several possible interpretations of this fact; the one we prefer is that large
organizations encompass transitions that would otherwise occur between smaller ones. This

"internal labor market" means that careers develop within the firm, though there may be no
less mobilityamong tasks in large organizations. We also find lower turnover in jobs that

The

interpretationis most accurate for small probabilities of leaving a job. For
probabilities in the neighborhood of .1 per quarter, the approximationis very good.

began with

a transition from a previous (covered) employer. This effect is implied by search:

jobs that begin with a transition from non-employment are less valued, on average, because
they need only dominate non-employment rather than a previous job.
Column (2) conditions on the log quarterly wage from the previous period. Because

jobs may begin or end at any time, jobs lasting two or fewer quarters do not provide a
complete quarter from which we may guage earnings. To account for this short job bias,
we interact the quarterly wage with dummy variables for the first two quarters of a job.

Thus the main effect of the wage refers

to. jobs that survive more

than two quarters. We

find that the job-specific wage is a key determinantof mobility At means, the estimate
implies that a 10 percent within career wage gain reduces the quarterly probability

of

leaving a job by about two percentage points. Since experienceand tenure (and other

of any systematic growth associated with
these variables. We take this as strong evidence in favor of a search-basedmodel of job
variables) are held constant, this estimate is net

changing.

-

Conditioning on the wage affects the other estimates. In column (1) we interpreted
the effect of

'Prior Job' in terms of selection on more valuable jobs. Consistent with this

argument, the effect is eliminated by conditioning on the wage, which appears to be the key
indicator of the value of a job. Firm size differentials also decline by roughly
indicating that size

is

a third,

in part a predictorof match quality. Nevertheless, the fact that

substantial size differences in turnoverremain after controlling for the wage also supports
the scale interpretation offered above.

The estimates confirm the sign reversal in the effect of experience on mobility,
which was illustrated in figure 2. The theory on this point refers to the effect of
experience at the start

of a job,

so the specification

in column

(3)—-which includes

interactions between tenure and experience——is the most appropriate test

of the hypothesis

that experienced workers are more poorly matched, wage held constant. At means, the

32
estimates imply that an extra five years

of experience would raise the quarterly probability

of changing jobs by about 50 percent (six percentage points).45
profile

As in

figure 3, the tenure

of job changing declines sharply during the first two years, after which the hazard

is fairly flat.46 And as in the figure, this pattern is not strongly affected by conditioning

on the wage.
Table 9 reports variants of the basic mobility model that control for the starting
wage on the job and for the rate

of job-specific wage growth.

In column (1), the

only

wage control is the starting wage, which sharply reduces mobility. This evidence ignores

the evolution of wages within a job, but it indicates the important role of heterogeneity in
available wage offers: transitions o higher wage jobs stabilize employment. This confirms

the heuristic evidence from table 7, above, where we found that between-job wage growth
was

larger in transitions to more durable jobs. Notice that since within-job wage gains are

ignored in this model, the interpretationof the tenure effect is altered so long as the value

of the job grows with tenure. Consistent with this, the tenure profile of mobility is
marginally steeper than in models that control for the current wage.
Column (2) allows the initial and current wages to have separate effects.

If the

current wage is fully informative about the future value of a job--an assumption of our
model based on the random walk result in table

on behavior. This hypothesis is rejected (1

—

6--the starting wage should have no effect

3.15): Though the

current wage clearly

dominates in mobility decisions, a higher starting wage increases mobility, conditional on the

current wage. This suggests a role for job-specific wage growth in affecting workers'

mobility decisions. We test for this in column (3), which controls for the average rate of

past wage growth on the job.

We

find that jobs offering higher wage growth are

significantly less likely to end, holding the current wage fixed. At means,

a five percent

increase in annual job-specific wage growth would reduce the quarterly probability of

changing jobs by about 0.8 points. This finding is reasonable

if jobs systematically differ

in

their prospects for earnings growth, though it is somewhat puzzling in light of our previous
evidence that within-job wage growth approximates a random walk. In that case, past wage

growth on a job is not informative about the future value of the job; so it should not
affect workers' mobility decisions.

5. ConclusIons
We have documentedthe important role of job mobility as an element of career
development among young workers. This career phase is characterized by a transition to
relatively stable employment relationships along a path
growth. During the

of high turnover and rapid wage

first ten years of labor force participation the typical young worker

holds seven jobs, and our estimates imply that over one third of average wage growth

during this period is attributable to job changing. This finding alone calls for a
reevaluation of the standard human capital investment model of lifecycle earnings growth.
Consistent with this, we have also shown that the job changing activities of young workers
are stronglyconsistent with matching models of on the job searclu controlling for
unobserved heterogeneity,the key element leading to the eventual durability of jobs is the
wage, growth of which is largely

an outcome of the search process itself. Good matches

tend to survive, and the decline in average mobilityas experience accumulates is mainly
attributable to locating such a match.

APPENDIX A
JOB SEARCH WITH HUMAN CAPITAL GROWTH

In this appendix we verify claims

made in text regarding the optimal mobility

decisions of workers. The model is similar to the matching models of Jovanovic (1979a,b),
though our analysis allows for (stochastic) growth of external wage offers--due to
accumulation of general human capital--as well as stochastic growth of wage offers within

a

job. Specifically, we assume that the offer distribution facing an individual with labor
market experience
drawn wage offer.

x is given by equation (5) in the text,

where

w0

denotes a randomly

If the location of the distribution is increasing in I, then G(z; X)

< 0.

This is assumed. We also assume that distribution (5) has uniformly bounded support on

I

0, and that the occurrence of offers from (5) is generated by a Poisson process with
parameter

1.

Internal wagegrowth is also stochastic. Recall that our evidence on internal wage
growth is that wages evolve as a random walk with drift. To reflect this structure, we
assume that the probability distribution

of a new wage offer from the current employer is

given by (6), which depends on the current wage, w, experience, X, and tenure, T. Thus

on-the-job wage growth is a submartingale.

The properties of the mobility rule that were stated in the text depend on the
effects of w,

I, and T on the value function (Al).

w is obvious: a higher

current wage

raises

That V(.) is monotonically increasing in

the value of the current job. The effects of

tenure on experience are more complicated, since the value function is not generally
differentiable in these arguments. Note, however, that the right side of (Al) maps the
space of continuous functions that are increasing in w into itself. Thus
V(.)

is

nonincreasing in T because a leftward translation of the density f(y: w,

I, T÷T), with strict inequality if r(•) > 0.

Expected future wage growth declines

with tenure, so an increase in current job tenure reduces the value of the job. In contrast,
the effect of additional experience on

V(w, X. T)

is unsigned greater experience increases

the distribution of external offers (Gx(') < 0), but reduces wage growth on the current job

(F()

These effects on the value

of a particular job are observable only through mobility

decisions. Since V(.) is increasing in w, the worker's search policy will possess the
reservation wage property. Thus there is a reservation offer, R(w. X, T), defining the
minimum acceptable outside wage offer, that satisfies

APPENDIX C
THE DATA

The LEED file begins in the first quarter of 1957 and ends in 1972. Our basic
criteria for extracting records from the file were
1.

The quarter of the individuals 18th birthday must occur in the data.

2. Each record must yield potential, post-l8 experience

of at least six years.

3. A record can contain no gaps in earnings that exceed two years.
4.

Quarters of experience are accumulated when cumulativeearnings from all

reported employers exceeds 70 percent of the minimum wage.
Reported earnings in the data are actual earnings reported by an employer up to the
Social Security limit in any calendar year. In some cases the limit was reached, in which
case we imputed earnings from past and future earning, with the same employer. For
example, for persons who broke the limit in the fourth quarter, imputed earnings are the
average

of third quarter earnings from year t and first quarter earnings from t+1 if no

change of employeroccured. For persona with a change of employer, third quarter earning,
are used. In 50 cases out of 1,103,980 an individual broke the limit in the first quarter.
These cases were deleted from the analysis

of wage growth.

In some case,, persons showed temporary changes in the identity of the major
employer, or temporarily (eli below the 70 percent earnings cutoff though the identity of
the employer did not change.

We

did not treat these cases as a break on the employment

relationship; rather we smoothed over the temporary change in the identity of the major

employer, so the periods are treated as a single job speli. Thus temporary changes in
earnings do not generate job change, unless a change in employer also occurred.

2

These selection criteria resulted in 9919 individual records, and approximately
296,000 job quarters of data. Further selection for the analysis

of wage growth and the

impact of wages on mobility restricted the sample to persons with 13 or more years of labor
market experience. For these persons "entry" was deemed to occur when earnings for a
quarter first exceeded the cutoff, and subsequentearnings for the following year also
exceeded the cutoff calculated on an annual basis. The resulting sample consisted of 872
persons who entered the market in or before the first quarter of 1959, with 44089 job
quarters in the data.
The programs used in creating the working data files may be obtained from the
authors on request. These files have been sent to the University of Michigan archives.
