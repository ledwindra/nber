The model  (i) is arbitrage-free, (ii) accommodates path-dependence, and (iii) handles a range of securities, even with American features.  The computer implementation uses a recursive scheme that is convenient and seamlessly processes forward induction and backward recursion, needed to compute more complicated derivative securities.\n\n",
