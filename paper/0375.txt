The Work and Wages of Single Women: 1870 to 1920

ABSTRACT

Single women in the U.S. dominated the female labor force

from 1870 to 1920. Data on the home life and working conditions of
women in 1888 and 1907 enable the estimation of earnings functions.
Work in the manufacturing sector for these women was task oriented

and payment was frequently by the piece. Earnings rose steeply with
experience and peaked early; learning was mainly on-the-job. Sex
segregation of employment is seen as a partial product of the method
of payment, and the early termination of human capital investment was
a function of the life-cycle labor force participation of these women,

although the role of the family is also critical.

1.0 The Era of Single Women Work: 1870 to 1920
In preface to a book on working women, a past president of the American
Economic Association has stated that:
"The importance of [this] subject. . .cannot well be overestimated. Our age may properly be called the Era of Woman,
because everything which affects her receives consideration
quite unknown in past centuries. . . [W]oman is valued as never
before. . .and. .

other half of the human race depends more largely upon the1
position enjoyed by woman than was previously understood."

Surprisingly enough, these are not the comments of John Kenneth Galbraith, but

those of Richard T. Ely writing in 1893. Generations other than ours have
also viewed themselves in the midst of radical change concerning the economic

role of women. But. Ely and his contemporaries, rather than being concerned
with married women's work, were more interested in the status of the young
and unmarried working woman. The conditions of industrial work for single

women, their health, their morals, and the sufficiency of the pay of those

living away from h were the heightened issues of a period witnessing the
rise of factory employment

expressed about the relative efficiency of the sexes, the related issue of pay

differentials,

and the impact of female labor on the economic position of

men.

In the history of woments labor market experience in the United States the
half century from about 1870 to 1920 was the era of single women.2 Fully 75% of

the

white female labor force in 1890

and 1900 were single and fewer than 10% were

married. But by the late 1920's married women comprised

over 25% of the female

work force. Even though the participation rate of single women continued to rise,
they became less a force in the economic history of American women.3 The history
of the female labor force from 1870 to 1920 was dominated and formed by single

2
women, and, correspondingly that from 1920 to 1970 by those who were married.
Accompanying these changes in the composition of the labor force was an evolution

of occupations, events that were not in the least unrelated. The first period
witnessed the peaking of the employment of women in manual, manufacturing
occupations and the second the rise of clerical employment.4
The concern for single working women in the Progressive Era led to the
collection of data on their industrial and social condition, and it is perhaps
ironic that these documents were ultimately used to draft legislation effectively

limiting their employment.5 These reports, whatever their original or eventual
purpose, are a remarkable depository of information on work and home life, and
it is fortunate that two of the most detailed records span the high-point of single
women's work in 2inerican history. Carroll Wright's Bureau of Labor document

Working Women in Large Cities (1889) and the nineteen volume report of the Secretary
of Commerce and Labor, Women and Child Wage Earners (1910), studies of women in
1888 and 1907 respectively, form the basis of this article on women in the midst
of the era of single women's work.

Ll Characteristics of Single Working Women, 1888 to 1907.6
Single working women at the turn of this century were historically unique in

terms of their home lives and occupations. They worked at a time when there were
primarily two positions available to urban women —— manual factory work and service
employment ——

and their occupations, unlike those in the then nascent clerical

sector, did not particularly prepare them to reenter the labor force after marriage.7
Their jobs were predominantly task oriented, were frequently paid for by the piece,
(between 35% and 47 % of women in manufacturing in 1890 worked on piece—rates) ,8

and were almost uniformly distinct from those occupied by men. They learned their
trades on—the-job in the factory, store, or home, and although their educations
preceded the rise of vocational schools for women, formal schooling was a clear

3

advantage

to them in the labor market.

Women frequently began their labor market experience when young, working

continuously until they married. But their age at first marriage was late,
indeed it

was the

percentage

latest of all birth cohorts of american women, and the

of these women who never married was correspondingly high. These

women worked in the labor market when it was con as well for a young girl
to have worked instead full-time in her parent's home. About 35% of all urban,
single women 16 to 24 years old were neither at school nor working outside their

homes in 1900, although only about 5% were by 1930. Therefore a large fraction
of these women were still attached to their parent's homes, working in them, or,

if they worked outside, giving their entire salaries to their families. But
fully 38% of all single urban women over 16 years old in 1900 lived away from

their parents with their employers or in the homes of others. Even though part
of this rather large figure is accounted for by servants, housekeepers, teachers,
and

from two federal

studies enable the estimation of a relationship between

earnings,experience on-the-job, and other variables which will provide insights
to these issues.

Carroll Wright's Working Women in Large Cities (hereafter the 1888 study),
the first federal report on working women, investigated the conditions of women
"who work in

great

city manufactories upon light manual or mechanical labor and

in stores (p. 9)." The study included 343

industries

in 22 cities and contained

information on 17,427 women, of whom 88% were single.9 It was not until the

Only city-industry averages can be used in the 1888 study, the original surveys
having never been located, but the 1907 study contains most of the

raw data

collected for 6 industries, in various locations, n total information on about
10,000 single girls). This article is based on all the observations for men's
clothing in Chicago, and

for

cotton textiles in Massachusetts and North Carolina,

1785 observations on single women of all ages. The 1888 study includes women living
away from home; the observations used for the 1907 study are only for those living
at home.

Learning on the job was considerable for individuals entering at any age.

Although maturity was a factor in the

function, it was not an
overriding one. Delaying entry into the labor force for one year added less than
12
3% to earnings, but working for that year would have added over 9%, (var. 10, col. 5).

In

other words, a 14 year old working for 2 years would earn at a maximum 6% less than

a 16 year old working for 2 years, bot the 14 year old working for 2 years would
earn 12% more

than a 16 year old just entering the labor force.

The shape of the earnings profile was, in addition, not merely a function of
some screening mechanism used to identify fast quitters from slow quitters. Various
economic theorists have posited that employers having fixed hiring costs and heterogeneous labor with not

by

easily identifiable characteristics will maximize profits

of earnings functions, one flat and one rising. This screening
mechanism ensures the self—selection of laborers, with the slow quitters opting
having two

types

for the rising function. The widespread use of piece rates for women is of

2.2 A Comparison of Male and Female Earnings Functions and the Role of the Family
The scant information that presently exists on the earnings of men with similar
characteristics during the same time period suggests that their earnings rose less

rapidly but peaked later than did those for women)5 Earnings were somewhat higher
for young girls than for young boys, but young boys received a higher return on their

education. Boys invested more in training, or should I say had more invested in them,
than did girls, and given their respective life—cycle labor force participation rates,

these may have been optimal strategies. But the implicit investment choice was made

more by parents than by youngsters. Parents were a large factor in the intergenerational transmission of cultural norms, and the earnings functions are suggestive in

this regard. Young women who lived at home earned less than did those who boarded
(var. 9, cols. 1 and 2), and, understandably, those who assisted at home earned

even less (var. 10). Those who lived away from home may have been a biased sample
of all young women in terms of their differences with their parents' decisions and in

terms of their innate ability. Those who mothers were alive earned less than did
those without mothers at home (vars. 9, cols. 3 and 4), an indication that girls
worked at home part—tine and either worked fewer hours in the factory or worked less
intensively.

Occupations and industries were often highly segregated by sex, and it is
likely that these divisions were less a reflection of inherent differences in ability
than they were a by-product of segregation by method of payment and the specialized

9

nature of work. Men were infrequently found in the tedious, task oriented jobs that
women held. Because of their greater expected attachment to the labor force they had
a greater incentive to perform efficiently in non—piece rate work and stood a higher
probability of eventually receiving 'prizes' in the form of promotions and monetary
rewards.

2.3 Education and Ethnicity
Education had a smaller impact on earnings than is observed for contemporary

data but was, nonetheless, an important factor. Although the results in col. 3
indicate that the foreign born (var. 7) earned 9% less than did native born with native
or foreign born parents, this differential disappears when relative maturity is

considered. The foreign born began work younger, and therefore given their level
of experience earned somewhat less.
3.0 Summary Remarks
In summary, work in the labor market for women from 1870 to 1920 was the realm
of the unmarried whose occupations involved much on-the—job-training but little long

ranged advancement. The estimated earnings functions are consistent with the hf e—
cycle labor force participation of these women. But the comment by one astute
observer that in "most cases, probably, woman's expectation of marriage is responsible
for her lack of skill, but in some instances, doubtless, her enforced lack of skill
is responsible for her longing for marriage as a relief from intolerable drudgery"
(1907 Study, Vol. 9, H. Sumner, p. 32)
indicates that this harmony need not have been universally felt or long lived.

women prior to 1870, but evidence that does exist suggests that the percentage of married women at work was higher in large cities prior to that

rates for single women by age, nativity, and race are given below for the
entire US, and for cities of over 100,000 in 1890, and it can be seen
that part of the rise in the labor force participation of single women
after 1890 was probably a function of the movement of population to the
cities.

7. Among all white working women in the U.S. in 1890, approximately 1/3 were
employed in domestic and personal service, 1/3 in manufacturing and mechanical
trades, 1/10 in trade and transportation, 1/10 in professional jobs, and the
rest in agriculture. Only a trivial fraction were clerical workers.
8. The lower bound is from the Federal Census of Manufactures, 1890, Part I,

is about 11%.

A time T, investment is zero. If T = 10, the results in Table 1, col. 3
yield k0 = 0.33 and r = 0.14; if T=7, k0=0.35, r=O.O6.
12. The 3% figure is a maximum because the 1907 study does not include information
on prior occupations. To the extent that there was a return to experience on
other jobs (see vars. 12, 13, and 14, cols. 1 and 2) the coefficient on the
age at beginning work would include it.
13. See, for example, Joanne Salop and Steven Salop, "Self-Selection and Turnover
in the Labor Market," Quarterly Journal of Economics (Nov. 1976), pp. 619-627,
who state that "the firm could pay for piecework, thereby allowing the worker
to receive the full value of his own marginal product and eliminating the
firm's interest in this information [viz, turnover costs] (p. 627)."
14. Lucy M. Salmon, Domestic Service (New York: 1972; reprinted from 1897 edition),
stated that:
"In the two occupations the wages in which have been compared
with those in domestic service [teaching and factory work] while
the general average wages are low, it is possible to reach through
a comparatively high point. The fact that the wage
promotion
plane is a high one is one inducement for women of average ability
to enter the occupation [servant]. On the other hand, the fact
that the wage limit, high as it is, is soon reached must act as
a barrier in the case of others (pp. 103-4)."
