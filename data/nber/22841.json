    "abstract": "\n\nMapping continuous raw scores from millions of Advanced Placement examinations onto the 1 to 5 integer scoring scale, we apply a regression discontinuity design to understand how students\u2019 choice of college major is impacted by receiving a higher integer score despite similar exam performance to students who earned a lower integer score.  Attaining higher scores increases the probability that a student will major in that exam subject by approximately 5 percent (0.64 percentage points), with some individual exams demonstrating increases in major choice by as much as 30 percent.  These direct impacts of a higher score explain approximately 11 percent of the unconditional 64 percent (5.7 percentage points) gap  in the probability of majoring in the same subject as the AP exam when attaining a 5 versus a 4.  We estimate that a substantial portion of the overall effect is driven by behavioral responses to the positive signal of receiving a higher score.\n\n",
