We find that in response to such a shock, employment, output, and nonresidential investment rise, while real wages, residential investment, and consumption expenditures fall.  The paper argues that a simple variant of the neoclassical model which distinguishes between nonresidential and residential investment is consistent with this evidence.\n\n",
