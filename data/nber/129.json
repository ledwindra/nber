The survey reflects in part my own research interests and biases and is not meant to be comprehensive. Four topics are covered: (1) demand for adults' health and medical care; (2) effects of health on labor supply and wage rates; (3) demand for children's health and medical care and (4) selected topics pertaining to the supply side of the medical care market.\n\n",
