ABSTRACT
A basic tenet of economics posits that when consumers or firms don't face the true social cost of their
actions, market outcomes are inefficient. In the case of negative externalities, Pigouvian taxes are one
way to correct this market failure, where the optimal tax leads agents to internalize the true cost of
their actions. A practical complication, however, is that the level of externality nearly always varies
across economic agents and directly taxing the externality may be infeasible. In such cases, policy
often taxes a product correlated with the externality. For example, instead of taxing vehicle emissions
directly, policy makers may tax gasoline even though per-gallon emissions vary across vehicles. This
paper estimates the implications of this approach within the personal transportation market. We have
three general empirical results. First, we show that vehicle emissions are positively correlated with
vehicle elasticities for miles traveled with respect to fuel prices (in absolute value)—i.e. dirtier vehicles
respond more to fuel prices. This correlation substantially increases the optimal second-best uniform
gasoline tax. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we show that a uniform tax performs very poorly
in eliminating deadweight loss associated with vehicle emissions; in many years in our sample over
75 percent of the deadweight loss remains under the optimal second-best gasoline tax. Substantial
improvements to market efficiency require differentiating based on vehicle type, for example vintage.
Finally, there is a more positive result: because of the positive correlation between emissions and elasticities,
the health benefits from a given gasoline tax increase by roughly 90 percent, compared to what one
would expect if emissions and elasticities were uncorrelated.

Introduction

A basic tenet of economics posits that when consumers or firms do not face the true social cost
of their actions, market outcomes are inefficient. In the case of externalities, Pigouvian taxes
provide one way to correct this market failure, and the optimal tax or subsidy leads agents to
internalize the true cost of their actions. A practical complication, however, is that the level
of externality nearly always varies across economic agents, and directly taxing the externality
may be infeasible. In such cases, policy often taxes or subsidizes a product correlated with
the externality. For example, instead of taxing vehicle emissions directly, policy makers
may tax gasoline even though per-gallon emissions vary across vehicles. Similarly, a uniform
alcohol or tobacco tax may be imposed as a means of reducing the negative externalities
associated with their use, even though externalities likely vary by person or alcohol type.
Or, in the case of positive externalities associated with research and development activities,
policy might subsidize R&D uniformly across firms.
In this paper, we address three related questions. First, what is the size of the optimal
uniform tax rate for gasoline? Second, how much deadweight loss (DWL) remains once
this tax is imposed? Finally, how does variation in responses to gasoline taxes affect the
benefits associated with gasoline or carbon taxes? Our empirical setting is the personal
transportation market in California between 1998 and 2008. We show three things.
First, we observe substantial variation in vehicle-level emissions (externalities) in the
light-duty vehicle market and, more importantly, that variation is correlated with the vehiclespecific elasticity of miles driven with respect to gasoline prices. Dirtier vehicles are more
price responsive. Using detailed vehicle-specific data on miles driven, we show that the
positive correlation between emissions and elasticities (in absolute value) holds for all three
local pollutant emissions—known as criteria pollutant emissions—for which we have data:
carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx ).1 It also holds for
fuel economy and vehicle weight. We find that the average “two-year” elasticity of miles
traveled is -0.15 across all vehicles, but the differences across vehicle types are substantial.
1

Criteria air pollutants are the only air pollutants for which the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established national air quality standards defining allowable ambient air
concentrations. Congress has focused regulatory attention on these pollutants (i.e., carbon monoxide, lead,
nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide) because they endanger public health and are
widespread throughout the United States

1

The elasticity for the dirtiest quartile of vehicles with respect to NOx is -0.29. The second,
third, and fourth quartile elasticities are -0.16, -0.06, and 0.04, respectively. Similar variation exists for CO and HCs. This correlation drives a wedge between the optimal uniform
Pigouvian tax associated with emissions, which should weight vehicles’ externalities by their
responsiveness to the tax, and what we call the “naive” tax, which is based on the average
externalities. The optimal tax is substantially larger, on the order of 50 percent, in each of
the years of our sample.
Second, we show that even when instituting the optimal uniform Pigouvian tax, the
uniform tax performs very poorly in eliminating DWL. Across our sample, we estimate that
the optimal uniform Pigouvian tax, a gasoline tax in this case, eliminates only 30 percent of
DWL associated with these pollutants. During the second half of our sample, 75 percent of
DWL remains under the optimal uniform tax.2
We investigate ways to improve upon this. We find that allowing gasoline taxes to be
county specific leads to a small improvement, increasing the amount of DWL eliminated by
less than 5 percentage points. We find moderate benefits from “homogenizing” the fleet,
potentially through vehicle retirement (e.g., “Cash-for-Clunkers”) programs; scrapping the
dirtiest 10 percent of vehicles reduces the remaining DWL by 14 percentage points. The
largest pay-offs come from conditioning taxes on vehicle type, in particular vehicle’s age.
Finally, we report some good news. We show that the positive correlation between emissions and the miles-driven elasticity implies that health benefits from a given gasoline, or
carbon, tax are larger than would be suggested by ignoring this correlation. We estimate
that across our sample, the health benefits of a gasoline tax, per gallon of gasoline reduced,
increase by 90 percent once one accounts for the the heterogeneity that we document. Furthermore, these differences are large enough to push a substantial gasoline tax of $1.00 per
gallon from harming welfare to improving welfare late in the sample.
We also investigate several sources of the heterogeneity in the responsiveness to gasoline
prices. At the most general level, we show that while the age of the vehicle contributes to
2

The closest paper in the literature to ours, in terms of this contribution, is Fullerton and West (2010).
They also investigate the amount of DWL eliminated by a uniform gasoline tax by calibrating a numerical
model with approximate miles and emissions obtained by matching inspection data from a small CARB
program to quarterly gasoline expenditures in the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Our estimates are based
on actual emissions, miles traveled, and gasoline prices from the universe of California vehicles. We find that
a uniform tax removes much less of the DWL of pollution compared to their calculations.

2

our results—older vehicles respond more to changes in gasoline prices—this does not explain
all or even most of the heterogeneity. There are at least two additional sources of criteria
pollutant-related heterogeneity in the response of changes in gasoline prices. For one, lowincome consumers may both own dirtier vehicles and respond more to changes in gasoline
prices. Second, the heterogeneity may come from within-household shifts in vehicle miles
traveled across household vehicles. For example if a household has one newer, more fuel
efficient vehicle, and one older vehicle, as gasoline prices increase, the household may shift
miles away from the older vehicle to the newer vehicle. Because age is, on average, correlated
with both fuel economy and criteria pollutant emissions, this would lead to our result. Our
data speak to this. We find that while there is evidence of both a within-household effect
and an income effect, a significant amount of variation persists once these are accounted for.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 draws on Diamond (1973) to derive the optimal
uniform gasoline tax and the amount of remaining DWL. Section 3 discusses the empirical
setting and data. Section 4 provides graphical support for the empirical results. Section 5
presents the main empirical model and results on miles driven. Section 6 estimates empirically the optimal uniform tax and welfare effects, and Section 7 presents the results from
our policy simulation. Section 8 concludes the paper.

Optimal Uniform Taxes

In this section, we derive the optimal uniform tax in the presence of heterogeneity in the
externality, following closely the model of Diamond (1973). We reiterate that the optimal
uniform Pigouvian tax is second best, because heterogeneity would imply taxing different
agents differently. We then add more structure to the problem to analytically solve for the
amount of remaining DWL.
Consumer h derives utility (indirectly, of course) from her gasoline purchases, αh , but is
also affected by the gasoline consumption of others, α−h (the externality). We assume singlecar households and discuss robustness to this assumption. Assuming quasi-linear preferences,
consumer h’s utility can be written as:

U h (α1 , α2 , ..., αh , ..., αn ) + µh .

3

(1)

We assume utility is monotone in own consumption, i.e.,

∂U h
∂αh

≥ 0.

These assumptions, along with assuming an interior solution for each consumer, lead to:
Proposition 1. The second-best tax is (from Diamond (1973)):
∗

τ =

−

∂U h 0
i6=h ∂αi αi
P 0
.
h αh

P P
h

(2)

Proof. See Appendix A.
The optimal uniform Pigouvian tax becomes a weighted average of vehicles’ externalities
where the weights are the derivative of the externality with respect to the tax. When the
price responsiveness and emissions are positively correlated, i.e. dirtier cars are more price
responsive, this will increase the optimal uniform Pigouvian tax.3
As Diamond explicitly discusses, there is no requirement that all of the αh0 s must be
negative, although the optimal second-best tax loses the interpretation as a weighted average.
Indeed, if households hold multiple vehicles, it is conceivable that miles traveled is shifted
from the low-mileage vehicle to the high-mileage vehicle. This also implies that the secondbest tax can be negative. For example, suppose the dirty vehicles had a positive milestraveled elasticity, while clean vehicles were very price sensitive. In this case, it may be
optimal for policy to subsidize gasoline.
Also, note that the elasticity of the negative externality with respect to price accounts
for any changes on the extensive margin. That is, if the gasoline tax increases the scrappage
rate of some vehicles, then the relevant derivative of the externality with respect to price is
the expected change in miles driven, not the change in miles driven, conditional on survival.
The presence of heterogeneity also implies that the uniform tax will not achieve the
first-best outcome. In short, the uniform tax will under-tax high externality agents and
over-tax low externality agents. We extend Diamond (1973) to solve for the amount of DWL
remaining in the presence of a uniform Pigouvian tax applied to a market with heterogenous
externalities. This requires a bit more structure.
3

As an intuitive example, imagine the case where there are only two vehicle types. The first emits little
pollution, while the second is dirtier. Also imagine the clean vehicles are completely price insensitive, while
the dirty vehicles are price sensitive. The naive Pigouvian tax would tax based on the average emissions of
the two vehicle types. However, the marginal emission is the emission rate of the dirty vehicles; the clean
cars are driven regardless of the tax level. In this case, we can achieve first best by setting the tax rate at
the externality rate of the dirty vehicle. There is no distortion to owners of clean vehicles since their demand
is completely inelastic, so we can completely internalize the externality to those driving the dirty vehicles.

Proposition 2. Suppose drivers are homogenous in their demand for miles driven, but
vehicles emissions differ. In particular, each consumer has a demand for miles driven given
as:
m = β0 − β1 dpm(pg + τ ).

If the distribution of the externality per mile, E, is log normal, with probability density

the DWL absent any market intervention will be given as:

Proof. See Appendix A.
This leads to the following calculation of remaining DWL under the optimal uniform
Pigouvian tax.
Proposition 3. Under the assumptions in Proposition 2, the ratio of remaining DWL after
the tax is imposed to the DWL absent the tax:

(5)

Proof. See Appendix A.
With externalities uncorrelated with the demand for miles driven, the remaining DWL
from a uniform tax depends only on the shape parameter of the externality distribution. The
larger σE2 is, the wider and more skewed will the distribution of the externality be, causing
the uniform tax to “overshoot” the optimal quantity of miles for more vehicles.
If the demand for miles driven is not homogeneous, and in fact is correlated with externalities per mile, the calculation changes. For ease, define Bi =

βi

and assume that Bi is

distributed lognormal with parameters µB and σB2 . Define ρ as the dependence parameter of
the bivariate lognormal distribution (the correlation coefficient of ln E and ln B). We then
have:
Proposition 4. When Bi and Ei are distributed lognormal with dependence parameter ρ,
the optimal tax is:
τ ∗ = eµE +

+ρσE σB

Proof. See Appendix A.
As we would expect, the optimal tax does not depend on the scale of the elasticity
distribution, only on the extent to which externalities are correlated with elasticities. We
can next calculate the amount of remaining DWL under both the naive and optimal uniform
Pigouvian tax.
Proposition 5. When Bi and Ei are distributed lognormal with dependence parameter ρ,
the ratios of the remaining DWL after the optimal uniform Pigouvian tax to the original
DWL will be:
2

R(τ ∗ ) = 1 − e−σE ,

(6)

And, the ratios of the remaining DWL after the naive uniform tax to the original DWL will
be:
2

R(τnaive ) = 1 − e−σE (2e−ρσE σB − e−2ρσE σB ).

(7)

Proof. See Appendix A.
As we would expect, the optimal tax correctly accounts for the correlation between
the externality and demand responses, and thus the remaining DWL depends only on the
variance and skewness of the externality distribution. However, in the presence of correlation
the naive tax reduces less of the DWL from the externality, reducing it by a proportion related
to the degree of correlation and the spread of the two distributions. The term in parentheses
in Equation (7) is strictly less than 1, and strictly greater than zero if ρ > 0, but may be
negative if ρ < 0 and the shape parameters are sufficiently large.
In Section 6, we will show that σE2 is such that R(τ ∗ ) is surprisingly large, and that while
R(τnaive ) is measurably larger, it is not much larger.

3.1

Empirical Setting
Data

Our empirical setting is the California personal transportation market. We bring together
a number of large data sets. First, we have the universe of smog checks from 1996 to 2010
from California’s vehicle emissions testing program, the Smog Check Program, which is
administered by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR). An automobile appears

6

in the data for a number of reasons. First, vehicles more than four years old must pass a
smog check within 90 days of any change in ownership. Second, in parts of the state (details
below) an emissions inspection is required every other year as a pre-requisite for renewing
the registration on a vehicle that is six years or older. Third, a test is required if a vehicle
moves to California from out-of-state. Vehicles that fail an inspection must be repaired and
receive another inspection before they can be registered and driven in the state. There is
also a group of exempt vehicles. These are: vehicles of 1975 model-year or older, hybrid and
electric vehicles, motorcycles, diesel-powered vehicles, and large natural-gas powered trucks.
These data report the location of the test, the unique vehicle identification number (VIN),
odometer reading, the reason for the test, and test results. We decode the VIN to obtain
the vehicles’ make, model, engine, and transmission. Using this information, we match the
vehicles to EPA data on fuel economy. Because the VIN decoding is only feasible for vehicles
made after 1981, our data are restricted to these models. We also restrict our sample to 1998
and beyond, given large changes that occurred in the Smog Check Program in 1997. This
yields roughly 120 million observations.
The smog check data report two measurements each for NOx and HCs in terms of parts
per million and CO levels as a percentage of the exhaust, taken under two engine speeds. As
we are interested in the quantity of emissions, the more relevant metric is a vehicle’s emissions
per mile. We convert the smog check reading into emissions per mile using conversion
equations developed by Sierra Research for California Air Resources Board in Morrow and
Runkle (2005), an evaluation of the Smog Check Program. The conversion equations are
functions of both measurements of all three pollutants, vehicle weight, model year, and truck
status.
We also estimate scrappage decisions using data reported to CARFAX Inc. for 32 million
vehicles in the smog check data. We detail this analysis in Appendix G. These data contain
the date and location of the last record of the vehicle reported to CARFAX. This includes
registrations, emissions inspections, repairs, import/export records and accidents.
At times we use information about the household. For a subsample of our smog check
data, we are able to match vehicles to households using confidential data from Department
of Motor Vehicle records that track the registered address of the vehicle. We use this information to aggregate up the stock of vehicles registered to an address. Appendix C discusses
7

how this is done. These data are from 2000 to 2008. Finally, we use gasoline prices from
EIA’s weekly California average price series to construct average prices between inspections.
Table 1 reports means and standard deviations of the main variables used in our analysis,
as well as these summary statistics split by both vehicle vintage and for 1998 and 2008. The
average fuel economy of vehicles in our sample is 23.5 MPG, with fuel economy falling over
our sample. The change in the average dollar per mile has been dramatic, more than doubling
over our sample. The dramatic decrease in vehicle emissions is also clear in the data, with
average per-mile emissions of HCs, CO, and NOx falling considerably from 1998 to 2008.
The tightening of standards has also meant that more vehicles fail the smog check late in
the sample, although some of this is driven by the aging vehicle fleet.

3.2

Automobiles, Criteria Pollutants, and Health

The tests report the emissions of three criteria pollutant: NOx , HCs, and CO. All three of
these result directly from the combustion process within either gasoline or diesel engines.
Both NOx and HCs are precursors to ground-level ozone, but, as with CO, have been shown
to have negative health effects on their own.4
While numerous studies have found links between exposure to either smog or these three
pollutants and health outcomes, the mechanisms are still uncertain. These pollutants, as
well as smog, may directly impact vital organs or indirectly cause trauma. For example,
CO can bind to hemoglobin, thereby decreasing the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream.
High levels of CO have also been linked to heart and respiratory problems. NOx reacts
with other compounds to create nitrate aerosols, which are fine-particle particulate matter
(PM). PM has been shown to irritate lung tissue, lower lung capacity, and hinder long-term
lung development. Extremely small PM can be absorbed through the lung tissue and cause
damage on the cellular level. On their own, HCs can interfere with oxygen intake and irritate
lungs. Ground-level ozone is a known lung irritant, has been associated with lowered lung
capacity, and can exacerbate existing heart problems and lung ailments such as asthma or
allergies.
4
CO has also been shown to speed up the smog-formation process. For early work on this, see Westberg
et al. (1971).

Preliminary Evidence

One of the main driving forces behind our empirical results is how vehicle elasticities, both
in terms of their intensive and extensive margins, vary systematically with the magnitude
of their externalities. In this section, we present evidence that significant variation exists in
terms of vehicle externalities within a year, across years, and even within the same vehicle
type (make, model, model year, etc.) within a year. Further, simple statistics, such as
the average miles traveled by vehicle type, suggest that elasticities may be correlated with
externalities.5
Figure 1 plots the distributions of NOx , HCs, and CO emissions in 1998, 2004, and 2010.
The distribution of criteria pollutant emissions tends to be right-skewed in any given year,
with a standard deviation equal to roughly one to three times the mean, depending on the
pollutant. This implies that some vehicles on the road are quite dirty relative to the mean
vehicle. Over time, the distribution has shifted to the left, as vehicles have gotten cleaner,
but the range remains.
This variation is not only driven by the fact that different types of vehicles are on the road
in a given year, but also variation within the same vehicle type, defined as a make, model,
model-year, engine, number of doors, and drivetrain combination. To see this, Figure 2 plots
the distributions of emissions for the most popular vehicle/year in our sample, the 2001
four-door Toyota Corolla in 2009. The vertical red line is at the mean of the distribution.
Here, again, we see that even within the same vehicle-type in the same year, the distribution
is wide and right-skewed. The distribution of HCs is less skewed, but the standard deviation
is 25 percent of the mean. CO is also less skewed and has a standard deviation that is
36 percent of the mean. Across all years and vehicles, the mean emission rate of a given
vehicle in a given year, on average, is roughly four times the standard deviation for all three
pollutants (Table A.1).
To understand how the distribution within a given vehicle changes over time, Figure 3
plots the distribution of the 1995 3.8L, front-wheel drive, Ford Windstar in 1999, 2001, 2004,
and 2007.6 These figures suggest that over time the distributions shift to the right, become
5

We are not the first to document the large variation across vehicles in emissions. See, for example, Kahn
(1996). Instead, our contribution is in finding a link between elasticities and emissions.
6
We chose this vehicle because the 1995 3.8L, front-wheel drive, Ford Windstar in 1999 is the second-most

9

more symmetric, and the standard deviation grows considerably, relative to the mean. Across
all vehicles, the ratio of the mean emission rate of NOx and the standard deviation of NOx
has increased from 3.16 in 1998 to 4.53 in 2010. For HCs, this increased from 3.59 to 5.51;
and, for CO it increased from 3.95 to 5.72.
These distributions demonstrate significant variation in emissions across vehicles and
within vehicle type, and thus significant scope for meaningful emissions-correlated variation
in elasticities along those lines. We next present suggestive evidence that this is the case. To
do this, we categorize vehicles into four groups, based on the quartiles of a given pollutant
within a given year. Next we scale the median annual miles traveled in the groups relative to
their 1998 values, and plot how this has changed over our sample—a period where gasoline
prices increased from roughly $1.35 to $3.20. Figure 4 foreshadows our results on the intensive
margin. For each pollutant, the log change in bottom-quartile vehicles is larger than the first
quartile, with the other two quartiles often exhibiting monotonic changes in miles driven.7
For each pollutant, we see that the dirtiest quartile saw the largest decreases in miles driven
during the run up gasoline prices. The ordering of the relative decreases suggests that dirtier
vehicles were more responsive over this period.

5

Vehicle Miles Traveled Decisions

Our first set of empirical models estimates how changes in gasoline prices affect decisions
about vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and how this elasticity varies with vehicle characteristics. Our empirical approach mirrors Figure 4. For each vehicle receiving a biennial smog
check, we calculate average daily miles driven and the average gasoline price during the
roughly two years between smog checks. We then allow the elasticity to vary based on the
emissions of the vehicle. We begin by estimating:
ln(V M Tijgt ) = β ln(DP Mijgt ) + γDtruck + ωtime + µt + µj + µg + µv + igt

(8)

where i indexes vehicles, j vehicle-types, g geographic locations, t time, and v vehicle age,
or vintage. DP Mijgt is the average DPM of the vehicle between smog checks, Dtruck is an
popular entry in our data and it is old enough that we can track it over four 2-year periods.
7
The levels also differ. Appendix Figure A.1 plots the median of daily miles traveled across our sample
split up by the emissions quartile of the vehicle.

10

indicator variable for whether the vehicle is a truck, and time is a time trend.8
Table 2 shows our basic results. We begin the analysis by including year, vintage, and zip
code fixed effects. We then progressively include finer vehicle-type fixed effects by including
make, then make/model/model-year/engine, and finally individual vehicle fixed effects. We
also differentiate the influence of gasoline prices by vehicle attributes related to the magnitude
of their negative externalities—criteria pollutants, CO2 emissions, and weight.
We do this in two ways. First, we split vehicles up by the quartile in which the vehicle
falls with respect to the within-year emissions of NOx , HCs, and CO, fuel economy (CO2 ),
and weight. Second, we include a linear interaction of the percentiles of these variables and
the log of gasoline prices. In Appendix B we investigate, in a semi-parametric way, the actual
functional form of this relationship and the robustness of our results to alternative sources
of variation in DPM.
Tables 2 shows our results, focusing on NOx . The changes from Models 1 to 5 illustrates
the importance of controlling for vehicle-type fixed effects. Initially, the average elasticity
falls from -0.265 to -0.117 when including fixed make effects, but then rises when including
finer detailed vehicle fixed effects. Our final specification includes individual vehicle fixed
effects yielding an average elasticity of -0.147.9 In Models 6 and 7 we examine heterogeneity
with vehicle fixed effects. Model 6 includes interactions with quartiles of NOx , as in Model
3. The DPM-elasticity for the cleanest vehicles, quartile one, is positive at 0.041, while the
DPM-elasticity for the dirtiest vehicles is twice the average elacticity at -0.288. To put these
numbers in context, the average per-mile NOx emissions of a quartile one vehicle is 0.163
grams, while the average per-mile NOx emissions of a quartile four vehicle is 1.68 grams.
Model 7 assumes the relationship is linear in centiles of NOx and finds that each percentile
increase in the per-mile NOx emission rate is associated with a change in the elasticity
of .001, from a base of essentially zero. This heterogeneity is also robust to allowing our
other covariates to vary with NOx quartiles, leveraging cross-sectional instead of time-series
variation, allowing a semi-parametric functional form for the heterogeneity and to employing
a log-linear specification with the level of dollars miles as the variable of interest. The details
8

Our DPM variable uses the standard assumption that 45 percent of a vehicle’s miles driven are in the
city and 55 percent are on the highway. This is the standard approach used by the EPA for combined fuel
economy ratings.
9
This is larger than that found in Hughes et al. (2008) reflecting the longer run nature of our elasticity.

11

of these robustness checks are reported in Appendix B.
We find similar patterns across the other externalities. There is slightly more heterogeneity over HCs and CO emissions than over NOx , with the dirtiest quartiles around -0.30
and the cleanest around 0.05. For CO2 the cleanest vehicles are those with the highest fuel
economy, and here we see the least fuel-efficient vehicles having an elasticity of -0.183, compared to -0.108. We observe some heterogeneity over weight as well, although it is smaller
than the other externalities. For the full set of results, see Appendix Table A.2.

5.1

The Source of the Heterogeneity

While the optimal uniform Pigouvian tax is not affected by the mechanism behind the
heterogeneity, it is of independent interest to investigate the mechanism. We investigate
three sources, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. First, it may be driven entirely
by a vintage effect. That is, older vehicles are both more responsive to changes in gasoline
prices and have higher emissions. Second, it might be driven by differences in the incomes of
consumers that drive dirtier versus cleaner vehicles.10 Third, it may result from households
shifting which of their vehicles are driven in the face of rising gasoline prices.
To investigate whether it is simply a vintage effect, we redefine the quartiles based on
the distribution of emissions within vintage and calendar year bins. We split vehicles into
three age categories: 4 to 9 years old, 10 to 15 years old, and 16 to 27 years old.
Table 3 reports the results for heterogeneity over NOx emissions.11 These results suggest
that while vintage is a factor in the externality-based heterogeneity, it is not the only source
or even the most important source. While middle-aged and older vehicles are more elastic
than new vehicles on average, within age bin there is still substantial heterogeneity. For
new vehicles, the difference between the dirtiest and cleanest quartiles is two thirds of the
range for the whole sample. Middle-aged vehicles have three quarters as much range, and
the oldest vehicles, 16 years and older, have a range nearly as large as for the whole sample.
We are able to group a subsample of our smog check vehicles into households. This
grouping comes from access to California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confidential

data. A number of steps are undertaken to “clean” the address entries in the DMV records.
These are discussed in Appendix C. Ultimately, however, the subsample of vehicles that we
are able to match likely draw more heavily from households residing in single-family homes.
Given this selection and the fact that the sample period differs from our base specification,
it is not surprising that we find average elasticities that differ from those presented above.
Table 4 presents the results from this subsample. For this sample, we construct two
additional variables meant to capture the household stock of vehicles. The variable “Higher
MPG in HH” equals one if there is another vehicle in the household that has a higher MPG
rating than the vehicle in question. Likewise, the variable “lower MPG in HH” equals one
if there is another vehicle in the household that has a lower MPG rating than the vehicle in
question.
If households shift usage from low-MPG vehicles to high-MPG vehicles, we would expect
“Higher MPG in HH” to be negative and “Lower MPG in HH” to be positive. Column 2 of
Table 4 adds these variables to our base specification. The point estimates suggest that a
vehicle in the highest fuel economy quartile belonging to a household that also has a lower
fuel economy vehicle has an elasticity greater than a third lower. We cannot reject the null
hypothesis that the sum of the interactions with quartile four and “Higher MPG in HH” is
zero.12
For this same sample of vehicles, we also use U.S. Census information based on zip-code
of residence to categorize owners into income quartiles. We interact these quartiles with
the log of DPM to see if differences in elasticities exist. Column 3 of Table 4 adds these
interaction terms. There is some evidence that higher-income consumers are less elastic, as
the emissions quartile effects persist; vehicles in the bottom quartile remain nearly three
times more sensitive even after accounting for income differences.
Our smog check data report the zip code of the testing station the vehicle visited. For our
more general sample, we also use this information to construct measures of income. Table
5 compares these results with the DMV data. We find similar differences in the elasticities,
despite the smaller average elasticity.
12

The sum of the two vehicle-stock variables is positive, but because lower fuel efficient vehicles are driven
more earlier in the sample, the elasticities are not comparable in terms of what they imply for total miles
driven.

Efficiency of Uniform Pigouvian Taxes

In this section, we consider the efficiency of using a uniform Pigouvian tax to abate the
externalities caused by driving, specifically those resulting from emissions of NOx , HCs, and
CO. We begin by calculating both the naive and optimal second-best Pigouvian tax, and
then compare the remaining DWL left over from these second-best taxes to the optimal
outcome obtained by a vehicle-specific tax.

6.1

Optimal Uniform Pigouvian Tax

We calculate the naive Pigouvian tax per gallon of gasoline as the simple average of the
externality per gallon caused by all vehicles on the road in California in a particular year.
We value the externalities imposed by NOx and HCs using the marginal damages calculated
by Muller and Mendelsohn (2009), based on the county in which each vehicle has its smog
check.13 For CO, we use the median marginal damage estimate from Matthews and Lave
(2000). Let the marginal damage per gram of pollutant p in county c be θcp , with emissions
rates in grams per mile by vehicle i of pi . Then the externality per mile of vehicle i, Ei is:
N Ox
CO
Ei = θhc · hi c + θcHC · H
· N
· C
i C +θ
i Oxc + θ
i Oc .

(9)

The naive tax in year y will then be simply:

N i=1 M P Gi

(10)

Following Proposition 1, we calculate the second-best optimal Pigouvian tax, taking into
account the heterogeneity in both levels of the externality and the responsiveness to gasoline
prices. We estimate a regression similar to Equation (8), but allowing the elasticity of VMT
with respect to DPM to vary over all our dimensions of heterogeneity. For more details, see
Appendix E. Let the group-specific elasticity for vehicle i be εqi , where q indexes cells by HC
emissions, NOx emissions, CO emissions, MPG, weight, and age, with the externalities again
13

Note that the values used in this paper differ from those used in the published version of Muller and
Mendelsohn (2009). The published values were calculated using incorrect baseline mortality numbers that
were too low for older age groups. Using corrected mortality data increases the marginal damages substantially. We are grateful to Nicholas Muller for providing updated values, and to Joel Wiles for bringing this
to our attention.

Table 6 shows the taxes based on the average and marginal externalities for each year from
1998 to 2008. The average externality is 61.2 cents per gallon of gasoline consumed in 1998,
while the marginal externality is 86 cents, 39 percent higher. The ratio of the average and
marginal tax increases even as the level of the externalities declines over time. From 2002
on, the marginal tax is at least 50 percent larger than the naive tax in each year.
We also account for vehicle owners’ decisions to scrap their vehicles are affected by
gasoline prices. Appendix G discusses the details and results of this exercise. To summarize,
we allow gasoline price to affect scrappage decisions, and allow this to vary over emissions
profiles and vintages. We find that the main source of heterogeneity occurs across vintages;
specifically, increases in gasoline prices increase the hazard rate of very old vehicles, but
decrease the hazard rate of middle-aged vehicles. Because emissions of criteria pollutants
are positively correlated with age, this has the effect of decreasing criteria pollutants.

6.2

Welfare with Uniform Taxes

We have shown that because of the correlation between elasticities and externality rates, the
optimal uniform Pigouvian tax is much higher than the naive tax calculated as the average of
per-gallon externalities. We now turn to the question of how much the optimal tax improves
welfare beyond what is achieved by the naive tax. We note again that even the optimal
uniform tax is still a second-best policy. Because of the heterogeneity in externality levels,
the most polluting vehicles will be taxed by less than their external costs to society, leaving
remaining dead weight loss. Vehicles that are cleaner than the weighted average will be taxed
14
We also weight vehicles based on the number of vehicles of that age and class that appear in the fleet as
a whole; see Appendix E.

15

too much, overshooting the optimal quantity of consumption and creating more DWL.
In each of the following analyses, we compare the remaining DWL resulting from the
local pollution externality with both the naive and marginal tax to the DWL without any
additional tax.
6.2.1

Simulation Results

We begin by approximating the ratios of DWL with and without tax using our data to
simulate the change in miles driven and thus in gasoline consumption from a tax. Let
milesyi be the actual average miles per day traveled by vehicle i between its last smog check
y

ˆ (τ ) be the miles per day that a vehicle
and the current one, observed in year y, and let miles
i
would travel if the average price of gasoline were raised by a tax of τ that is fully passed
through to consumers. We approximate DWL as a triangle, such that the ratio of interest
is:

The fully optimal tax would have a ratio of 0, while a tax that actually increased the
DWL from gasoline consumption would be greater than 1. Table 7 shows these ratios for
various taxes. The first two columns show ratios for a statewide tax based on the average
and marginal externalities, respectively, of all vehicles in California in each year. Deadweight
loss from the uniform naive tax averages 72.8 percent of DWL with no additional tax over
the sample period, and rises over time as the fleet becomes cleaner. The uniform marginal
tax is little better, averaging 69.8 percent of DWL with no tax during our sample period.
How can policy makers improve upon these results? The remaining columns of Table
7 allows the tax to vary so that it is uniform by groups, but not uniform over the entire
state. The marginal damages from Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) vary substantially at the
county level,15 due to both baseline emissions levels and the extent to which population is
exposed to harmful emissions. As such, a county-specific tax on emissions might be expected
to target externality levels more precisely. The third and fourth columns of Table 7 shows
15

We discuss this further in Appendix F.

16

the DWL ratios for an average and marginal tax computed this way, and it turns out there
is relatively little improvement. The average ratios over our sample are 0.684 for the naive
tax and 0.653 for the optimal uniform tax tax. Since emissions rates are highly correlated
with vintage, another approach would be to tax the average or marginal externality rate by
age.16 The fifth and sixth columns of the table show this, and here we see a substantial
improvement: 0.342 for the naive tax and 0.34 for a marginal tax. Combining these and
having the tax vary by both vintage and location, shown in the last two columns, reduces
the ratios to 0.276 and 0.274, respectively.
This analysis shows two striking results. First, a uniform Pigouvian tax does a terrible
job of addressing the market failure from pollution externalities. The dirtiest vehicles are not
taxed enough, and many clean vehicles are over-taxed. This is true even when the uniform
tax is calculated taking heterogeneity into account. The roughly 50 percent increase in the
tax level from a marginal tax correctly abates more emissions from the dirtiest vehicles,
but also over-taxes the cleanest vehicles by a larger amount. This is still an improvement
over the naive tax, but not by much. The number of vehicles for which the uniform tax
overshoots is remarkable. Table 8 shows the proportion of vehicle-years over the 11 years
of our sample for which each tax overshoots. Because the distribution of emissions is so
strongly right skewed, the naive uniform tax overshoots for more than 72 percent of vehicles,
and the optimal uniform tax for even more. Second, there is enough heterogeneity in the
distribution of the per-gallon externality that even a tax targeting broad groups leaves a
substantial portion of DWL. Overshooting is again an issue—when the tax is allowed to
vary by county and vintage, only the average tax by county and vintage overshoots for less
than 70 percent of vehicles.
The variance and skewness in the distribution of externality per gallon causes a uniform
tax to be less efficient than might otherwise be expected. Figure 5 shows this clearly, plotting
the kernel density of the externality per gallon in 1998 and 2008, with vertical lines indicating
the naive tax and the optimal tax, respectively. The long right tail of the distribution requires
that either tax greatly exceed the median externality.
We next examine how the optimal uniform tax would compare to the optimal vehicle
16

Such a system could be built within the Smog Check Program, with vehicle taxes based on mileage since
the previous test.

17

specific tax if the distribution became less skewed. That is, how would a uniform tax perform
if the right tail of the distribution—the oldest, dirtiest vehicles—were removed from the
road? This could be achieved directly from a Cash for Clunkers-style program, or indirectly
through tightening emissions standards in the Smog Check Program. Sandler (2012) shows
that vehicle retirement programs are not cost-effective in reducing criteria emissions, and
possibly grossly over pay for emissions; however the overall welfare consequences of this sort
of scheme may be more favorable if they improve the efficiency of a uniform gasoline tax.
Table 9 shows the ratios of DWL with the optimal Pigouvian tax to DWL with no tax, with
increasing proportions of the top of the externality distribution removed. Removing the top
1 percent increases the DWL reduction from 30 percent to 38 percent of the total with no
tax. Scrapping more of the top end of the distribution improves the outcome further. If the
most polluting 25 percent of vehicles were removed from the road and the optimal Pigouvian
tax was imposed based on the weighted externality of the remaining 75 percent, this would
remove 58.3 percent of remaining DWL. Of course, the practical complications of scrapping
this large a proportion of the vehicle fleet might make this cost-prohibitive.
6.2.2

Analytical Results

We can also calculate the ratio of remaining DWL to original DWL by calibrating Equations
(6) and (7) and with the moments in our data. The average value in our sample for the
lognormal shape parameters σE2 and σB2 are 1.47 and 1.51, respectively. The average value of
ρ, the correlation coefficient for the logs of externality and inverse elasticity, is 0.28.17 These
parameter values produce remaining DWL estimates in line with the simulation results in
Table 7. With σE2 around 1.47, the optimal uniform tax can only decrease DWL by 23
percent.

6.3

Treatment of Other Externalities

In the previous section we assumed that the difference between the socially optimal consumption of gasoline and actual consumption was entirely driven by externalities from local
pollution. In practice, there are several other externalities from automobiles, as well as
17

This is the average of parameters calculated separately for each year from 1998 to 2008. The parameters
do not vary much over time. For the year-by-year parameter estimates, see Table A.7 in the online appendix.

18

existing federal and state taxes on gasoline. Examples of additional externalities include
congestion, accidents, infrastructure depreciation, and other forms of pollution. The combined state and federal gasoline tax in California was $0.47 during our sample period.
Many of these other externalities are similar to criteria pollution emissions in the sense
that they also vary across vehicles. Congestion and accident externalities depend on when
and where vehicles are driven. Accident and infrastructure depreciation depend to some
degree on vehicle weight.18 We lack vehicle-specific measures of these other externalities to
measure how they impact our calculations of the amount of remaining DWL after imposing a
uniform Pigouvian tax. Insofar as additional variation exists we are understating the level of
remaining DWL, although not necessarily the share of remaining DWL. One way to interpret
our results is that by ignoring the existing taxes we are assuming that existing taxes exactly
equal the uniform Pigouvian tax associated with these other externalities, and that we are
also ignoring the remaining DWL due to the fact that these externalities are not uniform
across vehicles.
One externality that does not vary across vehicles is the social cost of CO2 emissions due
to their contribution to climate change. Because CO2 emissions are, to a first-order approximation, directly proportional to gasoline consumption, in this case a per-gallon gasoline tax
is the optimal policy instrument. The larger the climate change externality, the greater the
share of DWL eliminated from the uniform Pigouvian tax will be. To get a sense of how climate change externalities affect our calculations, we repeat the analysis for a range of social
costs of carbon (SCC). The “correct” social cost of carbon depends on a number of factors,
such as assumptions about the mappings between temperature and GDP, between GDP and
CO2 emissions, and between CO2 emissions and temperatures, as well as assumptions on the
discount rate and the relevant set of economic agents. Greenstone et al. (2011) estimate the
SCC for a variety of assumptions about the discount rate, relationship between emissions
and temperatures, and models of economic activity. For each of their sets of assumptions,
they compute the global SCC; focusing only on the US impacts would reduce the number
considerably. For 2010, using a 3 percent discount rate, they find an average SCC of $21.40
per ton of CO2 or roughly 19.5 cents per gallon of gasoline, with a 95th percentile of $64.90
18

For estimates on the degree of this heterogeneity, see Anderson and Auffhammer (2011) and Jacobsen
(Forthcoming).

19

(59 cents per gallon).19 Using a 2.5 percent discount rate, the average SCC is $35.10 (38.6
cents per gallon).
We calculate the remaining DWL, varying the SCC from zero cents per gallon to $1.00
per gallon ($91 per to of CO2 ). While our discussion focuses on the externalities associated
with CO2 , we stress that these calculations are relevant for any externalities for which a
per-gallon tax is the first-best instrument. They also represent the lower bound on the
remaining DWL when we consider any other externality for which a per-gallon tax is a
second-best instrument. For example, if one considers externalities associated with accidents
or congestion to be $0.30 per gallon on average, then insofar that a per-gallon tax is not
optimal, more DWL will remain than what we report.
Figure 6 summarizes the results across all years in our sample. The points associated
with an extra per-gallon externality of zero correspond to Table 7.20 Not until the extra
per-gallon externality exceeds $0.20 per gallon does a uniform gasoline tax eliminate the
majority of DWL associated with both the criteria pollutants and per-gallon externality.
Even if the per-gallon externality is $1.00, nearly 20 percent of combined DWL remains
under both the optimal naive and marginal taxes.

7

Benefits from Gasoline or Carbon Taxes

We have shown that the positive correlation between emissions and sensitivity to gasoline
prices increases the optimal gasoline tax. At the same time, the large variation in automobile
emissions implies that a uniform gasoline tax does a poor job eliminating the DWL associated with both local and global pollution. The positive correlation between emissions and
sensitivity to gasoline prices has a second effect: because a given gasoline tax (or carbon tax)
affects dirty vehicles more, the positive correlation increases the amount of local-pollution
benefits arising from a given gasoline or carbon tax. This, in turn, reduces the net social
cost of such a policy, and to our knowledge, has been ignored in the discussion surrounding
the desirability of carbon tax or cap-and-trade policy.
We calculate the cost of a relatively high tax on CO2 net of local-pollution benefits.
19

These calculations assume that the lifecycle emissions of gasoline are 22 pounds per gallon.
Note that the figure plots the weighted averages across the years, while the last row in Table 7 is a simple
average of the annual weighted averages.
20

20

Specifically, we use our data to simulate the change in emissions resulting from a $91 tax
on CO2 , which translates to a $1 increase in the gasoline tax.21 This is much higher than
permit prices in Europe’s cap-and-trade program, which peaked at $40 per ton of CO2 equivalent in 2008 and have plummeted since. It is also higher than permit prices expected
in California’s cap-and-trade program which are estimated to reach of roughly $30 per ton
of CO2 -equivalent. The Waxman-Markey Bill of 2009 expected a similar permit price.
We account for the intensive margin of driving, including all the dimensions of heterogeneity we have documented in Section 5. For completeness, we also include heterogeneity
in the extensive margin of scrappage, using results that we document in Appendix G. The
extensive margin has little impact on our results. For this simulation, we assume that the
tax was imposed in 1998, and use our empirical models to estimate the level of gasoline
consumption and emissions from 1998 until 2008, if gasoline prices had been $1 greater.
Appendix E provides details of the steps we take for the simulation.
Tables 11 and 12 show the results of our simulation for each year from 1998-2008, and
the yearly average over the period.22 The first two columns shows the total reduction in
annual gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, in millions of gallons and millions of tons,
respectively. The next two columns value the DWL from the reduction in gasoline consumption.23 The next section of the table presents the social benefit resulting from the reduction
in NOx , HC, and CO due to the tax. Social benefits are valued using the marginal damages
of NOx and HC calculated by Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) and the median CO value from
Matthews and Lave (2000). Finally, the last column of the table shows the net cost per ton
of carbon dioxide abated, accounting for the reductions in criteria pollution.
Table 11 shows the results of a simulation that does not account for heterogeneity across
emissions profiles. The reduction in gasoline consumption declines over time, from around
470 million gallons in 1998 to around 219 in 2008. The reduction in criteria pollutants
declines quickly as the fleet becomes cleaner. Nonetheless, the local-pollution benefits of a
gasoline tax are substantial, averaging 42 percent of the DWL over the ten-year period.
21

We assume all of the tax is passed through to consumers. Our implicit assumption is that the supply
elasticity is infinite. This is likely a fair assumption in the long-run and for policies that reduce gasoline
consumption in the near-term.
22
Additionally, Table A.9 shows results excluding effects on the extensive margin. These results are very
similar to Table 12.
23
We approximate DWL as ∆P 2·∆Q and adjust for inflation.

21

Table 12 adds heterogeneity in the intensive and extensive margins. The total change in
gasoline consumption is smaller, declining from 272 million gallons in 1998 to 110 million
gallons in 2008. This results from more fuel-efficient vehicles having a higher average VMT.
However, reductions in criteria pollutants are much larger. In 1998 the local-pollution benefits are over 126 percent of the DWL, and the net cost of abating a ton of carbon is negative
until 2002. On average, we estimate that benefits of a decrease in local air pollution from a
gasoline tax would be about 85 percent of the change in surplus between 1998 and 2008.
Consistent with the way smog is formed, the majority of benefits come from reductions
in HCs, because most counties in California are “NOx -constrained.” In simplest terms,
this means that local changes in NOx emissions do not reduce smog, but changes in HCs
do. In addition to the smog benefits from reducing HCs and NOx , we also find significant
local-pollution benefits arising from CO reductions.
We argue that these results should be viewed as strict lower bounds of the local-pollution
benefits for a variety of reasons. First, we have valued the benefits from NOx and HCs using
the most conservative marginal damages from Muller and Mendelsohn (2009). Muller and
Mendelsohn’s estimates depend heavily on the value placed upon mortality. Their baseline,
used here in Tables 11 and 12, assumes the value of a statistical life (VSL) to be $2 million,
weighted by remaining years of life, and they acknowledge this may not be the correct value.
For instance, the U.S. EPA assumes a VSL of $6 million. Muller and Mendelsohn also
calculate a scenario, with a VSL of $6 million, constant over ages, that yields much higher
marginal damages. If we use the marginal damages from this scenario, we find that with
heterogeneity, the benefits average more than three times the DWL over the period, and
remain twice as large in 2008.24
There are other reasons why our estimates should be considered a lower bound. First, we
have ignored all other negative externalities associated with vehicles; many of these, such as
particulate matter, accidents, and congestion externalities, will be strongly correlated with
either VMT or the emissions of NOx , HCs, and CO. Second, because of the rules of the Smog
Check Program, many vehicles are not required to be tested, leading to their omission in this
analysis. Third, a variety of behaviors associated with smog check programs would lead the

22

on-road emissions of vehicles to likely exceed the tested levels. These include, but are not
limited to, fraud, tampering with emission-control technologies between tests, and failure to
repair emission-control technologies until a test is required. Appendix F also suggests that
these results may also represent a lower bound across other states.
When we account for the heterogeneity in responses to changes in gasoline prices, we see
that local-pollution benefits would substantially ameliorate the costs of an increased gasoline
tax. These benefits would have been especially substantial in the late 1990s, but persist in
more recent years as well, even though the fleet has become cleaner. To put these numbers
into context, recall that Greenstone et al. (2011) estimate a SCC for 2010, using a 3 percent
discount rate, of $21.40, with a 95th percentile of $64.90. Using a 2.5 percent discount rate,
the average SCC is $35.10. Our results suggest that once the local-pollution benefits are
accounted for, a $1.00 gasoline tax (i.e., a tax of $91 per ton of CO2 ) would be nearly costeffective, even at the lower of these three numbers and well below the average social cost of
capital using a 2.5 percent interest rate.25

8

Conclusions

In this paper we show three general empirical results. First, the sensitivity to a given vehicle’s
miles traveled to gasoline prices is correlated with the vehicle’s emissions. Dirtier vehicles
are more price responsive. This increases the size of the optimal uniform gasoline tax by as
much as 50 percent.
Second, gasoline taxes are an inefficient policy tool to reduce vehicle emissions. Gasoline
taxes are often promoted as a means of reducing vehicle emissions. The optimal policy
would differentially tax vehicles based on their emissions, not gasoline consumption. While
gasoline consumption and emissions are positively correlated, we show that gasoline taxes
are a poor substitute for vehicle-specific Pigouvian taxes. The remaining DWL under the
optimal gasoline tax exceeds 75 percent in the second half of our sample, and surpasses 70
percent across all years.
Finally, the correlation we document leads to a positive result. We show that this correlation significantly increases the health benefits associated with gasoline taxes. This final
25

Of course, a tax somewhere below this would likely maximize welfare.

result increases the attractiveness of carbon taxes as a means of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, especially considering that existing policies used to reduce greenhouse gasoline
emissions from transportation—CAFE standards, ethanol subsidies, and the RFS—fail to
take advantage of these local-pollution benefits. In fact, they can even increase criteria pollutant emissions, because they reduce the marginal cost of an extra mile traveled. Given
that previous work analyzing the relative efficiency of these policies to gasoline or carbon
taxes has ignored the heterogeneity that we document, such policies are less efficient than
previously thought.

Note: Statistics are means with standard deviations presented below in parentheses. Weighted fuel economy is from
EPA. Dollars per mile is the average gasoline price from EIA in between smog checks divided by fuel economy.
Average household income is taken from the 2000 Census ZCTA where the smog check occurred. Dataset
contains one observation per vehicle per year in which a smog check occurred.

Notes: DWL with no tax calculated based on the difference in emissions from imposing a tax equal to the actual
externality per gallon consumed by a particular car. Marginal tax computed as the weighted average of externality
per gallon, using the negative slope of the vehicle’s demand curve as the weight.

Where p is the price and τ the tax per gallon. Assuming an interior solution, we have:
∂U h
= (p + τ ).

This yields demand curves, given by:
αh∗ = αh (p + τ ) .

Robustness Checks

In this appendix, we report the results of several robustness checks to our main results
on the intensive margin. Table A.2 reports elasticities by quartile for all five categories of
externality.
Our base specification controls for the fixed effect of a each NOx quartile on miles traveled. One might be concerned, however, that variation in dollars per mile (DPM) might be
correlated with other characteristics such as age, odometer, and demographics, and that the
DPM-quartile interactions may be picking up this correlation, rather than true heterogeneity.
To test for this, in Table A.5 we present results with vehicle fixed effects and interactions between NOx quartiles and various control variables. Adding these interaction terms actually
makes the heterogeneity in the effect of DPM more pronounced.
Table A.6 repeats the same exercise, but uses levels rather than logs of DPM as the
variable of interest. The results are qualitatively similar, with substantial heterogeneity in
every specification. However, with a log-linear specification we do not observe the cleanest
vehicles having a positive coefficient.
We also investigate the functional forms of these relationships in a semi-parametric way.
For each externality, we define vehicles by their percentile of that externality. We then estimate Equation (8) with separate elasticities for vehicles falling in the zero to first percentile,
first to second, etc. Appendix Figure A.2 plots a LOWESS smoothed line through these 100
separate elasticity estimates. For the three criteria pollutants, we find that the relationship
is quite linear with the elasticity being positive for the cleanest 10 percent of vehicles. The
dirtiest vehicles have elasticities that are roughly 0.4. For fuel economy, the relationship is
fairly linear from the 60th percentile onwards, but begins steeply and flattens out from the
20th percentile to the 40th. The elasticity of the lowest fuel economy vehicles is nearly 0.6.
To put these numbers into context across the different years, the average fuel economy of
44

the 20th percentile is 18.7, while the average for the 40th percentile is 21.75. The variation
in elasticities across weight is not monotonic. The relationship begins by increasing until
roughly the 20th percentile, and then falls more or less linearly thereafter. The elasticity of
the heaviest vehicles is roughly 0.3.
Note that the roughly linear relationship between criteria pollutant emissions and the
elasticity is not due to “over smoothing.” Appendix Figure A.3 plots the LOWESS smoothed
lines for HCs under different bandwidths. The top left figure simply reports the 100 elasticities. There is some evidence that the relationship is not monotonic early on, but from
the 5th percentile on, the relationship appears monotonic. Doing this exercise for the other
criteria pollutants yields similar results.

Steps to Clean Smog Check Data

C.1

Smog Check Data

California implemented its first inspection and maintenance program (the Smog Check Program) in 1984 in response to the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments. The 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments required states to implement an enhanced inspection and maintenance
program in areas with serious to extreme non-attainment of ozone limits. Several of California’s urban areas fell into this category, and in 1994, California’s legislature passed a
redesigned inspection program was passed by California’s legislature after reaching a compromise with the EPA. The program was updated in 1997 to address consumer complaints,
and fully implemented by 1998. Among other improvements, California’s new program introduced a system of centralized “Test-Only” stations and an electronic transmission system
for inspection reports.26 Today, more than a million smog checks take place each month.
Since 1998, the state has been divided into three inspection regimes (recently expanded
to four), the boundaries of which roughly correspond to the jurisdiction of the regional Air
Quality Management Districts. “Enhanced” regions, designated because they fail to meet
state or federal standards for CO and ozone, fall under the most restrictive regime. All of
the state’s major urban centers are in Enhanced areas, including the greater Los Angeles,
San Francisco, and San Diego metropolitan areas. Vehicles registered to an address in an
26

Enhanced area must pass a biennial smog check in order to be registered, and they must
take the more rigorous Acceleration Simulation Mode (ASM) test. The ASM test involves
the use of a dynamometer, and allows for measurement of NOx emissions. In addition, a
randomly selected two percent sample of all vehicles in these areas is directed to have their
smog checks at Test-Only stations, which are not allowed to make repairs.27 Vehicles that
match a “High Emitter Profile” are also directed to Test-Only stations, as are vehicles that
are flagged as “gross polluters” (those that fail an inspection with twice the legal limit of one
or more pollutant in emissions). More recently some “Partial-Enhanced” areas that require
a biennial ASM test have been added, but no vehicles are directed to Test-Only stations.
Areas with poor air quality not exceeding legal limits fall under the Basic regime. Cars
in a Basic area must have biennial smog checks as part of registration, but they are allowed
to take the simpler Two Speed Idle (TSI) test and are not directed to Test-Only stations.
The least restrictive regime, consisting of rural mountain and desert counties in the east and
north, is known as the Change of Ownership area. As the name suggests, inspections in
these areas are only required upon change of ownership; no biennial smog check is required.
Our data from the Smog Check Program essentially comprise the universe of test records
from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2010. We were able to obtain test records only
going back to 1996 because this was the year when the Smog Check Program introduced its
electronic transmission system. Because the system seems to have been phased in during
the first half of 1996, and major program changes took effect in 1998 we limit our sample to
test records from January 1998 on. For our analyses, we use a 10 percent sample of VINs,
selecting by the second to last digit of the VIN. We exclude tests that have no odometer
reading, with a test result of “Tampered” or “Aborted” and vehicles that have more than
36 tests in the span of the data. Vehicles often have multiple smog check records in a year,
whether due to changes of ownership or failed tests, but we argue that more than 36 in what
is at most a 12 year-span indicates some problem with the data.28
A few adjustments must be made to accurately estimate VMT and emissions per mile.
27

Other vehicles can be taken to Test-Only stations as well if the owner chooses, although they must get
repairs elsewhere if they fail.
28
For instance, there is one vehicle in particular, a 1986 Volvo station wagon, which has records for more
than 600 smog checks between January 1996 and March 1998. The vehicle likely belonged to a smog check
technician who used it to test the electronic transmission system.

46

First, we adjust odometer readings for “roll overs” and typos. Many of the vehicles in our
analysis were manufactured with 5-digit odometers–that is, five places for whole numbers
plus a decimal. As such, any time one of these vehicles crosses over 100,000 miles, the
odometer “rolls over” back to 0. To complicate matters further, sometimes either the vehicle
owner or smog check technician notices this problem and records the appropriate number
in the 100,000s place, and sometimes they do not. To address this problem, we employ an
algorithm that increases the hundred thousands place in the odometer reading whenever a
rollover seems to have occurred. The hundred thousands are incremented if the previous test
record shows higher mileage, or if the next test record is shows more than 100,000 additional
miles on the odometer (indicating that the odometer had already rolled over, but the next
check took this into account). The algorithm also attempts to correct for typos and entry
errors. An odometer reading is flagged if it does not fit with surrounding readings for the
same vehicle–either it is less than the previous reading or greater than the next–and cannot
be explained by a rollover. The algorithm then tests whether fixing one of several common
typos will make the flagged readings fit (e.g., moving the decimal over one place). If no
correction will fit, the reading is replaced with the average of the surrounding readings.
Finally, if after all our corrections any vehicle has an odometer reading above 800,000 or has
implied VMT per day greater than 200 or less than zero, we exclude the vehicle from our
analysis. All of our VMT analyses use this adjusted mileage.
Emissions results from smog checks are given in either parts per million (for HC and NOx )
or percent (O2 , CO, and CO2 ). Without knowing the volume of air involved, there is no
straightforward way to convert this to total emissions. Fortunately, as part of an independent
evaluation of the Smog Check Program conducted in 2002-2003, Sierra Research Inc. and
Eastern Research Group estimated a set of conversion equations to convert the proportional
measurements of the ASM test to emissions in grams per mile traveled. These equations are
reported in Morrow and Runkle (2005) and are reproduced below. The equations are for
HCs, NOx , and CO, and estimate grams per mile for each pollutant as a non-linear function
of all three pollutants, model year, and vehicle weight. The equations for vehicles of up to

Steps to Clean DMV Data

We deal with two issues associated with DMV data. The main issue is that DMV entries for
the same addresses will often have slightly different formats. For example, “12 East Hickory
Street” may show up as “12 East Hickory St,” “12 E. Hickory St.”, etc. To homogenize the
entries, we input each of the DMV entries into mapquest.com and then replace the entry
with the address that mapquest.com gives.
Second, the apartment number is often missing in DMV data. This has the effect of
yielding a large number of vehicles in the same “location.” We omit observations that have
49

over seven vehicles in a given address or more than three last names of registered owners.

Details of the Gasoline Tax Policy Simulation

For the intensive margin, we estimate a regression as in column 6 of Tables 2 and A.2, except
that we interact ln(DPM) with quartile of fuel economy, vehicle weight, and emissions of HC,
NOx , and CO, and dummies for vehicle age bins, again using bins of 4-9, 10-15, and 16-29
years, and control for the direct effects of quartiles of HC, NOx , and CO emissions. As in
Table 3, we use quartiles calculated by year and age bin. The coefficients are difficult to
interpret on their own, and too numerous to list. However, most are statistically different
from zero, and the exceptions are due to small point estimates, not large standard errors.
As in Section G, we compress our dataset to have at most one observation per vehicle per
year. Each vehicle is then assigned an elasticity based on its quartiles and age bin. Vehicle
i’s VMT in the counterfactual with an additional $1 tax on gasoline is calculated by:

V

where V M TBAU
is vehicle i’s actual average VMT per day between its current and previous

smog check, Pi is the average gasoline price over that time, and βi is the elasticity for the
fuel economy/weight/HC/NO/CO/age cell to which i belongs.
For the extensive margin, we estimate a Cox regression on the hazard of scrappage for
vehicles 10 years and older, stratifying by VIN prefix and interacting DPM with all five
type of quartiles and age bins 10-15 and 16-29. Similar to the intensive margin, we assign
each vehicle a hazard coefficient based on its quartile-age cell. Cox coefficients can be
transformed into hazard ratios, but to simulate the affect of an increase in gasoline prices on
the composition of the vehicle fleet, we must convert these into changes in total hazard.
To do this, we first calculate the actual empirical hazard rate for prefix k in year t as:

OrigHazardkt =

Dkt
,
Rkt

where Dkt is the number of vehicles in group k, that are scrapped in year t, and Rkt is the
number of vehicle at risk (that is, which have not previously been scrapped or censored).
We then use the coefficients from our Cox regression to calculate the counterfactual hazard
50

faced by vehicles of prefix k in quartile-age group q during year t as:29

N ewHazardqkt = OrigHazardkt · exp


1
· γq ,
M P Gk

where M P Gk is the average fuel economy of vehicle of prefix k and γq is the Cox coefficient
associated with quartile group q. We then use the change in hazard to construct a weight
Hqkt indicating the probability that a vehicle of prefix k in quartile group q in year t would
be in the fleet if a $1 gasoline tax were imposed. Weights greater than 1 are possible, which
should be interpreted as a Hqkt − 1 probability that another vehicle of the same type would
be on the road, but which was scrapped under “Business as Usual.” Because the hazard is
the probability of scrappage in year t, conditional on survival to year t, this weight must
be calculated interatively, taking into account the weight the previous year. Specifically, we
have:
Hqkt =

t
Y

(1 − (N ewHazardqkj − OrigHazardkt )).

j=1998

We also assign each vehicle in each year a population weight. This is done both to scale
our estimates up to the size of the full California fleet of personal vehicles, and to account for
the ways in which the age composition of the smog check data differs from that of the fleet.
We construct these weights using the vehicle population estimates contained in CARB’s
EMFAC07 software, which are given by year, vehicle age, and truck status. Our population
weight is the number of vehicles of a given age and truck status in a each year given by
EMFAC07, divided by the number of such vehicle appearing in our sample. For instance, if
EMFAC07 gave the number of 10-year-old trucks in 2005 as 500, while our data contained
50, each 10-year-old truck in our data would have a population weight of 10. Denote the
population weight by Ptac , where t is year, a is age, and c is truck status.
There is an additional extensive margin that we have not estimated in this paper: new
car purchases. To ensure that the total vehicle population is accurate, we apply an ad hoc
correction based on Busse et al. (forthcoming), who find that a $1 increase in gasoline prices
would decrease new car sales by 650,000 per year. Because California’s vehicle fleet makes
up about 13 percent of the national total, we decrease the population of model years 1998
and later by 84,500 when constructing the population weight for the counterfactual. We
29

Note that age group is determined by model-year and year.

51

apply 40 percent of the decrease to trucks, and 60 percent to passenger cars. Denote the
“new car effect” nc .
We estimate the total annual emissions by passenger vehicle in California of NOx , HC,
CO, and CO2 as actually occurred, and under a counterfactual where a $1 gasoline tax was
imposed in 1998. Let i denote a vehicle, a vehicle age, c truck status. Then the annual
emissions of pollutant p in year t under “business as usual” are:
Emissionpt
BAU =

X

i
Ptac · V M TBAU
· ri (p) · 365,

i

and under the counterfactual they are:
Emissionpt
counterf actual =

X

i
(Ptac −1(model year >= 1998)·nc )·Hqkt ·V M Tcounterf
actual ·ri (p)·365,

i

where ri (p) is the emissions rate per mile of pollutant p for vehicle i. For NOx , HC, and
CO, this is the last smog check reading in grams per mile, while for CO2 this is the vehicle’s
gallons per mile multiplied by 19.2 pounds per gallon.

F

California versus the Rest of the United States

Given that our empirical setting is California, it is natural to ask whether our results are
representative of the country as a whole. At the broadest level, the local-pollution benefits
from carbon pricing are a function of the per-capita number of miles driven, the emission
characteristics of the fleet of vehicles, and the marginal damages of the emissions. We present
evidence that the benefits may, in fact, be larger outside of California. The reason for this
is that while the marginal damages are indeed larger in California, the vehicle stock in
California is much cleaner than the rest of the country because California has traditionally
led the rest of the U.S. in terms of vehicle-emission standards.
The results in Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) provide a convenient way to test whether
California differs in terms of marginal damages. Table A.12 presents points on the distribution of marginal damages for NOx , HCs, and the sum of the two, weighted by each
county’s annual VMT.30 Figure A.6 plots the kernel density estimates of the distributions.
30
All of the points on the distribution and densities discussed in this section weight each county by its
total VMT.

52

We present the sum of because counties are typically either “NOx constrained” or “VOC
(HC) constrained,” and the sum is perhaps more informative. As expected, the marginal
damages are higher in California for HCs, but lower for NOx , as California counties tend
to be VOC-constrained. The sum of the two marginal damages is 78 percent higher in
California. Higher points in the distribution show an even larger disparity.
This effect is offset, however, by the cleaner vehicle stock within California—a result of
California’s stricter emission standards. To illustrate this, we collected county-level average
per-mile emission rates for NOx , HCs, and CO from the EPA Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES). This reports total emissions from transportation and annual mileage for
each county. Table A.12 also presents points on the per-mile emissions, and Figure A.7 plots
the distributions.31 Mean county-level NOx , HCs, and CO are 67, 36, and 31 percent lower
in California, respectively. Other points in the distributions exhibit similar patterns.
Finally, we calculate the county-level average per-mile externality for each pollutant, as
well as the sum of the three. Table A.12 and Figure A.8 illustrates these. As expected,
the HC damages are higher, but the average county-level per-mile externality from the sum
of the three pollutants is 30 percent lower in California than the rest of the country; the
25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile are 35, 30, and 9 percent lower, respectively.
These calculations suggest that, provided the average VMT elasticities are not significantly
smaller outside of California and/or the heterogeneity across vehicle types is not significantly
different (in the reverse way), our estimates are likely to apply to the rest of the country.

G

Scrappage Decisions

Our next set of empirical models examines how vehicle owners’ decisions to scrap their vehicles due to gasoline prices. Again we will also examine how this effect varies over emissions
profiles.
We determine whether a vehicle has been scrapped using the data from CARFAX Inc.
We begin by assuming that a vehicle has been scrapped if more than a year has passed
between the last record reported to CARFAX and the date when CARFAX produced our
31

We note that these exceed the averages in our data. This may reflect the fact that smog checks are not
required for vehicles with model years before 1975, and these vehicles likely have very high emissions because
this pre-dates many of the emission standards within the U.S.

53

data extract (October 1, 2010). However, we treat a vehicle as being censored if the last
record reported to CARFAX was not in California, or if more than a year and a half passed
between the last smog check in our data and that last record. As well, to avoid treating
late registrations as scrappage, we treat all vehicles with smog checks after 2008 as censored.
Finally, to be sure we are dealing with scrapping decisions and not accidents or other events,
we only examine vehicles that are at least 10 years old.
Some modifications to our data are necessary. To focus on the long-term response to
gasoline prices, our model is specified in discrete time, denominated in years. Where vehicles
have more than one smog check per calendar year, we use the last smog check in that year.
Also, because it is generally unlikely that a vehicle is scrapped at the same time as its last
smog check, we create an additional observation for scrapped vehicles either one year after
the last smog check, or six months after the last CARFAX record, whichever is later. For
these created observations, odometer is imputed based on the average VMT between the
last two smog checks, and all other variables take their values from the vehicle’s last smog
check. An exception is if a vehicle fails the last smog check in our data. In this case, we
assume the vehicle was scrapped by the end of that year.
Because many scrapping decisions will not take place until after our data ends, a hazard
model is needed to deal with right censoring. Let Tjivg be the year in which vehicle i, of
vehicle type j, vintage v, and geography g, is scrapped. Assuming proportional hazards, our
basic model is:
Pr[t < Tijvg < t + 1|T > t] = h0jv (t) · exp{βxDP Migt + γDf ailit + ψGigt + αXit },
where DP Migt is defined as before; Df ailit is a dummy equal to one if the vehicle failed a
smog check any time during year t; G is a vector of demographic variables, determined by
the location of the smog check; X is a vector of vehicle characteristics, including a dummy
for truck and a sixth-order polynomial in odometer; and h0ijv (t) is the baseline hazard rate,
which varies by time but not the other covariates. In some specifications, we will allow each
vehicle type and vintage to have its own baseline hazard rate.
We estimate this model using semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards regressions,
leaving the baseline hazard unspecified. We report exponentiated coefficients, which may

54

be interpreted as hazard ratios. For instance, a 1 unit increase in DPM will multiply the
hazard rate by exp{β}, or increase it by (exp{β} − 1) percent. In practice, we scale the
coefficients on DPM for a 5-cent change, corresponding to a $1.00 increase in gasoline prices
for a vehicle with fuel economy of 20 miles per gallon.
Tables A.3 and A.4 show the results of our hazard analysis. Models 1 and 2 of Table A.3
assign all vehicles to the same baseline hazard function. Model 1 allows the effect of gasoline
prices to vary by whether or not a vehicle failed a smog check. Model 2 also allows the effect
of gasoline prices to vary by quartiles of NOx .32 Models 3 and 4 are similar, but stratify the
baseline hazard function, allowing each VIN prefix to have its own baseline hazard function.
Model 5 allows the effect of gasoline prices to vary both by externality quartile and age
group, separating vehicles 10 to 15 years old from vehicles 16 years and older.
Models 1 and 2 indicate that increases in gasoline prices actually decrease scrapping on
average, with the cleanest vehicles seeing the largest decreases. The effect is diminished
once unobserved heterogeneity among vehicle types is controlled for, but is still statistically
significant. However, the true heterogeneity in the effect of gasoline prices on hazard seems
to be over age groups. Model 5 shows that when the cost of driving a mile increases by
five cents, the hazard of scrappage decreases by about 23 percent for vehicles between 10
and 15 years old, while it increases by around 3 percent for vehicles age 16 and older, with
little variation across NOx quartiles within age groups. This suggests that when gasoline
prices rise, very old cars are scrapped, increasing demand for moderately old cars and thus
reducing the chance that they are scrapped.
Table A.4 presents the quartile by age by DPM interactions for each of the 5 externality
dimensions. Hydrocarbons and CO have the identical pattern to NOx , with no heterogeneity
within age-group. With fuel economy and vehicle weight, there is within-age heterogeneity,
although the form is counter-intuitive. The heaviest and least fuel-efficient vehicles are
relatively less likely thank the lightest and most fuel-efficient vehicles to be scrapped when
gasoline prices increase. That is, while all 10- to 15-year-old vehicles are less likely to be
scrapped, the decrease in hazard rate is larger for heavy, gas-guzzling vehicles. For vehicles
16 years and older, the heaviest quartile is less likely to be scrapped when gasoline prices
32

Quartiles in these models are calculated by year among only vehicles 10 years and older.

55

increase, even though the lightest (and middle quartiles) are more likely. As the model
stratifies by VIN prefix, this cannot be simply that more durable vehicles have lower fuel
economy.
In summary, increases in the cost of driving a mile over the long term increase the
chance that old vehicles are scrapped, while middle-aged vehicles are scrapped less, perhaps
because of increased demand. Although vehicle age is highly correlated with emissions of
criteria pollutants, there is little variation in the response to gasoline prices across emissions
rates within age groups.

Notes: DWL with no tax calculated based on the difference in
emissions from imposing a tax equal to the actual externality
per gallon consumed by a particular car. Marginal tax computed as the weighted average of externality per gallon, using
the negative slope of the vehicle’s demand curve as the weight.

Net Cost

Note: All units are in millions. Dollar figures are inflation adjusted to 2008 terms. NOx and HC are valued as in Muller and Mendelsohn’s (2009) Baseline
scenario by the county where each vehicle received its Smog Check. The values vary substantially across counties, but a population-weighted average for the
state values HC at $3638.62 per ton per year, and NOx at $125.26 per ton per year. CO is valued at $802.88, as per the median value of Matthews and Lave
(2000).

Note: All units are in millions. Dollar figures are inflation adjusted to 2008 terms. NOx and HC are valued as in Muller and Mendelsohn’s (2009) USEPA
scenario by the county where each vehicle received its Smog Check. The values vary substantially across counties, but a population-weighted average for the
state values HC at $23897.10 per ton per year, and NOx at $1995.43 per ton per year. CO is valued at $802.88, as per the median value of Matthews and Lave
(2000).
