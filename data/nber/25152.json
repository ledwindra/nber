    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper studies how the impact of monetary policy depends on the distribution of savings from re\ufb01nancing mortgages. We show that the e\ufb03cacy of monetary policy is state dependent, varying in a systematic way with the pool of potential savings from re\ufb01nancing. We construct a quantitative dynamic life-cycle model that accounts for our \ufb01ndings and use it to study how the response of consumption to a change in mortgage rates depends on the distribution of savings from re\ufb01nancing. These e\ufb00ects are strongly state dependent. We also use the model to study the impact of a long period of low interest rates on the potency of monetary policy. We \ufb01nd that this potency is substantially reduced both during the period and for a substantial amount of time after interest rates renormalize.\n\n",
