ABSTRACT
There are persistent differences in self-reported subjective well-being across U.S. metropolitan areas,
and residents of declining cities appear less happy than other Americans. Newer residents of these
cities appear to be as unhappy as longer term residents, and yet some people continue to move to these
areas. While the historical data on happiness are limited, the available facts suggest that cities that
are now declining were also unhappy in their more prosperous past. One interpretation of these facts
is that individuals do not aim to maximize self-reported well-being, or happiness, as measured in surveys,
and they willingly endure less happiness in exchange for higher incomes or lower housing costs. In
this view, subjective well-being is better viewed as one of many arguments of the utility function,
rather than the utility function itself, and individuals make trade-offs among competing objectives,
including but not limited to happiness.

According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), only 35.9 percent of the
residents of the Gary, Indiana metropolitan area report themselves as very satisfied with their
lives, as opposed to 45.7 percent across the United States as a whole. Self-reported unhappiness
is high in other declining cities, and this tendency persists even when we control for income, race
and other personal characteristics. Why are the residents of some cities persistently less happy?
Given that they are, why do people choose to live in unhappy places?
The presence of significant differences in self-reported well-being across places within the
United States poses something of a challenge for the reigning paradigm of urban economics—the
concept of a spatial equilibrium. This central idea—proposed by Alonso (1962), Muth (1964),
Rosen (1976) and Roback (1982)—assumes that wages and prices adjust so that in equilibrium
there are no arbitrage opportunities across space. In equilibrium, individuals cannot improve
their overall utility levels by migrating within the U.S.
There are two ways to reconcile differences in self-reported well-being with the notion of a
spatial equilibrium. First, subjective well-being (SWB) may not be equivalent to the economist’s
concept of utility. Under this view, agents make decisions in order to jointly maximize expected
future happiness and other objectives. Compensating differences in other dimensions offset
persistent spatial differences in happiness. Second, the observed differences in subjective wellbeing may not reflect the permanent life-long well-being for otherwise identical people. The
unhappiness might be transitory or explained by unobserved individual heterogeneity, especially
if some areas attract people who are disproportionately prone to be more or less happy.
In Section I of this paper, we follow the work of Oswald and Wu (2011) and use BRFSS to
measure subjective well-being across the United States. We extend their work by calculating
SWB at finer geographic levels, adjusting for observable individual differences, and correcting
for sampling error. We find significant, although not huge, differences across metropolitan areas
both with and without controlling for state fixed effects. After correcting for sampling noise, we
find that the cross-city standard deviation of happiness is about 6 percent of a standard deviation
of individual happiness. This is approximately the difference in subjective well-being between
the sexes, or between high school graduates and those with some college. This difference is
roughly the order of magnitude caused by a one standard deviation decline in neighborhood
poverty (Ludwig et al., 2012). We also find that this variation persists when we control for a rich
battery of individual controls, including employment status and income.
One primary concern is whether these differences are caused by unobserved heterogeneity, either
in human capital or in propensity towards happiness. To address this worry, we turn to the panel
data in the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). Using this panel, we can
estimate area-level happiness by looking at individuals who move across metropolitan areas
between the survey’s first wave (1987-1988) and second wave (1992-1994). Differences in
happiness persist, even when we control for individual fixed effects. The correlation between
area level estimates with and without individual level fixed effects is 0.69. This leads us to
2

believe that much of the difference in happiness across space reflects more than the selection of
unhappy people into unhappy places.
We next document that area-level happiness is essentially uncorrelated with many area attributes.
For example, metropolitan area population and housing values are orthogonal to subjective wellbeing in the BRFSS. Like Florida et al. (2013), we find that area-level education is positively
associated with subjective well-being, but we find that this effect vanishes when we control for
individual-level education. If more educated individuals only became educated because of the
education level of the area, then it can be fairly said that these places have made them happier.
But if they would have been educated regardless of place, then the happiness of more educated
areas should be interpreted as differential selection.
In Section II, we document the one robust fact that emerges clearly from multiple data sets:
places with lower levels of population and income growth are less happy (Glaeser and Redlick,
2009). Lucas (2013) also finds higher rates of migration to counties with higher subjective wellbeing in the BRFSS, arguing that the migration patterns are consistent with a spatial equilibrium
with happiness as a measure of utility. We find the relationship persists for quite long periods
(from 1950 to 2000). Moreover, we find the strongest effect at the left tail of SWB. It is not that
high-growth places are particularly happy, but rather that very low-growth areas are particularly
unhappy. It is possible that people flee areas that produce unhappiness, but the long time periods
involved make it hard to believe that these well-being differences are transitory.
We show that the connection between low well-being and decline persists when we control for a
bevy of individual controls, including education and income, and even when we control for state
fixed effects. This fact appears in the NSFH and General Social Survey (GSS) as well as the
BRFSS. In the NSFH, the effect does not persist in the general individual fixed effects
estimation, but it re-emerges when we limit our sample to cities with more than 250 respondents
across both waves. None of these results speak to whether unhappiness is causing decline or
whether decline is causing unhappiness.
Section II also notes three other facts about urban decline and unhappiness. First, while Oswald
and Wu (2010) document the relationship between state-level happiness and amenities, we find
that the connection between unhappiness and decline in the BRFSS does not reflect the role of
urban disamenities associated with decline, such as crime, coldness and inequality. Second, both
the GSS and the NSFH allow us to examine movers, and we find that the connection between
urban decline and low levels of SWB is just as strong among recent migrants as among longer
term residents. This latter fact leans against the interpretation that happiness was ex ante
identical across areas, but that some areas experienced negative shocks, people were stuck in
those areas and their happiness fell accordingly.
Third, we ask whether the unhappiness of declining cities is a new phenomenon, perhaps caused
by decline, or represents a more historic tendency. The General Social Survey enables us to look
3

back as far as the early 1970s, and these data suggest that the connection between decline and
unhappiness was stronger in the past than it is today. We also have Gallup surveys from the
1940s that show a significant connection between unhappiness and city population during those
years, although that connection is not stronger in states that experienced more urban decline.
These facts lead us to suspect that the connection with unhappiness and urban decline more
likely reflects long-standing attributes of these cities rather than a causal effect of the decline
itself.
In Section III, we propose a framework that incorporates spatial differences in SWB into the
spatial equilibrium framework. Following writers as diverse as Epictetus, de Mandeville, Irving
Fisher and Gary Becker, we assume that happiness, or life satisfaction, is desirable—but far from
equivalent to utility. We have objectives in life other than being satisfied, and we may
knowingly make choices that reduce happiness, such as exposing ourselves to a more
competitive environment, if those choices further other aims (Luttmer, 2007; Benjamin et al.,
2011). According to the spatial equilibrium logic, urban unhappiness must be offset by some
other urban amenity, such as higher real incomes.
In our model, happiness is generated through experiences, which can be improved by spending
money, and happiness is but one ingredient in the utility function. Individuals have other
objectives, which we refer to as achievements, such as raising a family. These are also produced
with a combination of money and time. The model suggests that the connection between money
and happiness may significantly understate the connection between money and utility, because a
higher opportunity cost of time causes individuals to engage in less happiness-generating leisure.
In a spatial equilibrium, higher wages are compensated shifts, typically offset by higher real
estate prices, so higher area wages could easily be associated with lower happiness levels even if
utility levels are equalized across space.
In Section IV, we examine whether individuals in declining or otherwise unhappy places are
being compensated for their unhappiness. In the 1940 Census, residents of declining cities were
receiving significantly higher incomes. A one standard deviation drop in population growth
post 1950 was associated with $222 more in income ($3,655 in current dollars), which is more
than ten percent of average income. Presumably, high labor costs were one reason why
businesses left these areas. One interpretation of these results is that the industrial cities were
less happy in 1940, but their residents were being compensated with earnings that could achieve
other ends, such as nurturing a family.
The data also shows that housing prices in 1940 were higher in areas that subsequently declined,
yet there are essentially no housing quality controls in that early data. As such, while it is
possible that some of the high earnings in declining cities were eaten away by higher housing
rents, it is also possible that these rents were actually compensation for better housing quality.

4

When we turn to 2000 Census data, we find that the unhappy, declining cities are no longer
receiving higher wages. Wages are essentially uncorrelated with our growth variable in the more
modern data. But decline is correlated with house prices and rents. In 1940, the residents of
unhappy, declining places seem to have been compensated with higher incomes. In 2000, the
residents of those same cities seem to have been compensated with lower housing costs.
We have also examined the direct correlation between our area level happiness measure and
area-level rents and incomes, as in Oswald and Wu (2011). We do find some evidence that
residents of happy cities pay higher rents, suggesting some form of offset for the added level of
happiness. The results are certainly compatible with the view that individuals trade other
objectives against happiness when they are choosing where to live. Section V concludes.

I.

Unhappiness Across Cities

In this section, we briefly document five stylized facts about urban happiness, primarily in the
U.S., but also abroad. We then discuss the connection between unhappiness and decline in
Section II.
Throughout this paper, we follow the literature in measuring happiness using self-reported
survey data on subjective well-being (SWB). Our primary data source is a large national survey,
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), which asks individuals to report on their own life satisfaction
using a discrete response scale.
Since 2005, CDC has asked all respondents “In general, how satisfied are you with your life?”
Respondents were given four possible categories: very satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied, and very
dissatisfied. In each year between 2005 and 2010, around 300,000 subjects answer this question,
along with all of the demographic variables listed below. We recognize that satisfaction may
strictly differ from happiness, but we will use the terms interchangeably.
The distribution of answers in this sample is shown in Panel A of Table 1. Across these five
years, 45.6% of individuals responded that they were “very satisfied” with their life, while 48.7%
responded that they were “satisfied”, 4.6% responded that they were “unsatisfied” with their life
and slightly over 1.1% reported being “very dissatisfied”. These numbers are very consistent
between years. This question has been the focus of much of the previous literature on the
economics of happiness.
In all of the work that follows, we recode these answers so that 4 indicates “very satisfied” and 1
indicates “very dissatisfied.” We then rescale the answers linearly so that they have a mean of 0

5

and standard deviation of 1. 1 Because BRFSS data report the county in which the respondent
lives, we are able to link respondents to metropolitan areas.
This measure has several problems, even before considering whether this corresponds to the
economic concept of “utility.” First, respondents may have different interpretations of the scale
used to code responses, or different reference points for life satisfaction. A life situation that one
person may consider to be very satisfactory, may be merely satisfactory to another. To the extent
that this leads to systematically different responses across respondents, it could confound this
variable’s interpretation.
To address this issue, we estimate metropolitan area 𝑗 happiness as the MSA 𝑗 fixed effect in the
following model:
(1)

𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝛽 + 𝛾𝑡 + 𝑢𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗

We estimate equation (1) at the individual level, so 𝑖 indexes individual respondents, 𝑗 indexes
areas, and 𝑡 indexes the survey wave. In this regression, 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑡 represents individual subjective
well-being (or SWB), 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a matrix of individual controls, 𝑢𝑗 is a metropolitan area fixed
effect, 𝛾𝑡 is a year fixed effect, and 𝜖𝑖𝑗 is an uncorrelated error term. The individual controls
include survey month, sex, a polynomial in age, eight race dummies, six marital status dummies,
four educational attainment dummies, and variables representing various information about the
children in the household. 2
Second, respondents undoubtedly have a large degree of variability in their happiness at the
moment they answer the survey. Because we only have responses from a small fraction of
residents in each area (around 0.1%), this variability is likely to cause noisy estimates of arealevel SWB. To account for this, we next measure area-level happiness using random effects
instead of fixed effects. We estimate the following model, in which coefficients in bold type are
considered to be fixed, while the others are random effects: 3
(2)

𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝜶 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝜷 + 𝜸𝒕 + 𝑢𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗

We consider the demographic characteristics to have a fixed relationship with individual
happiness, and allow for random metropolitan area effects as well as an individual error term.

The Data Appendix discusses the issues that arise from the discrete nature of the answers and why we do not think
they are a problem, as well as other details of our estimation.
2
See the Data Appendix for more details.

So one might prefer to call this a “mixed effects” model as opposed to a pure “random effects” model.

6

This model enables us to compute a number of useful quantities. It allows us to calculate an
estimate of the underlying variance of metropolitan area effects (𝜎𝑢2 ). For each area, we can also
determine the best estimate 𝑢�𝑗 of that area’s 𝑢𝑗 . We refer to these estimates as the metropolitan
area’s adjusted life satisfaction. We use them extensively in subsequent analysis as our estimate
of the area’s contribution to individual happiness. 4
Finally, since BRFSS has only asked about life satisfaction since 2005, we have a very limited
ability to address time-series variation in happiness. We will thus augment it with other data
sources introduced below. We first turn to five sets of facts about life satisfaction across space.
1.

Are There Significant Differences in Life Satisfaction across Space?

We first address whether there is a meaningful difference in happiness levels across geographic
areas, both before controlling for individual demographic characteristics and after including
these controls. We answer this question in multiple ways. First, we run the fixed effects
regression (1) and perform an F-test of the joint significance of the metropolitan area fixed
effects. Second, we determine whether the estimated variance of metropolitan area random
effects in regression (2), 𝜎𝑢2 , is significantly different from zero. Third, we perform a likelihood
ratio test of the fixed effects model (2) against a constrained model in which the random effects
are removed (we force 𝑢𝑗 = 0 for all 𝑗).

We run each of these tests on a model with no demographic controls, and with the full set of
demographic controls shown in Appendix Table 1. In both cases, all three tests strongly reject
the null hypothesis that metropolitan area effects are irrelevant, and all with p < 0.0001.

Our next task is to quantify the differences across regions. We do so using two different
measures from the random effects estimates in (2). First, 𝜎𝑢2 provides an estimate of the variance
across the full population of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Second, the empirical
variance of the adjusted life satisfaction values, 𝑉𝑎𝑟�𝑢�𝑗 �, quantifies the dispersion of estimates
in the sample of areas where we are able to compute happiness.
In the unadjusted random effects model (where 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 is empty so we have no demographic

estimates 𝜷), we find 𝜎𝑢 = 0.063 ± 0.004 and 𝑠𝑑�𝑢�𝑗 � = 0.058. Since all of our analyses use
measures of SWB rescaled to have zero mean and unit variance across individuals, the variation
across geographic regions is around 6% of the individual-level variation in happiness.

Our calculation of these adjusted life satisfaction measures 𝑢�𝑗 recognizes the problem of potentially large sampling
variation when measuring SWB in a survey. We therefore calculate the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) based
on our MSA-level random effects from (2), following the method of Bates and Pinheiro (1998) as implemented in
Stata.

4

7

These numbers shrink by about one-quarter, to 𝜎𝑢 = 0.047 ± 0.003 and 𝑠𝑑�𝑢�𝑗 � = 0.042, when
we include the demographic controls in model (2). The distribution of these adjusted life
satisfaction estimates is shown in Figure 1.
To get a better sense of what this means quantitatively, we can compare it to the estimates of the
impact of other characteristics on individual SWB. Moving across one standard deviation in
geographic areas has an impact one-third as large as the difference between being a high school
graduate or not graduating, or 1.8 times the estimated male-female gap. Based on column 3 in
Appendix Table 1, which includes 8 income bins in addition to the basic demographic covariates,
the difference between earning $35,000-$50,000 (category 6) and $50,000-$75,000 (category 7)
is around 0.11, or roughly two metropolitan area standard deviations, 2𝜎𝑢 .

The values of our local happiness estimates themselves are shown visually in Figure 2. This map
shows adjusted life satisfaction estimated at the MSA and rural area level after controlling for
individual demographics. The map shows a band of less happy areas in parts of the Midwest and
the Appalachian states, stretching from Missouri in the west and Alabama in the south well into
Pennsylvania and even New Jersey in the east. New York City, Detroit, and much of California
also have lower SWB than the happiest areas, which are concentrated in the West, Upper
Midwest, and rural areas in the South. Appendix Table 2 shows specific values for a handful of
metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions, including the highest and lowest values that we
estimate.
In Figure 3, we adjust for employment status and income. Income depends on numerous
individual choices, including where to live and possibly including one’s happiness level. So we
have to interpret area-level happiness estimates that result from this estimation much more
cautiously, and as measures only of that part of area-level happiness that is orthogonal to
productivity. Keeping this in mind, we show these estimates in Figure 3. This map shows
unhappiness much more strongly concentrated in wealthier, urban areas along with the Rust Belt.
Because we have now eliminated any happiness component coming through the urban areas’
higher incomes—by controlling for their effect on the respondents’ income—the map does not
mean that they are less happy than other locales. Instead, only the part of area-specific happiness
that does not come through income appears to be negative in these regions.
A third potential problem with these results is that they may reflect differences in the ways in
which states implement the BRFSS. Unlike many surveys, the BRFSS is not centrally
administered. Instead, individual state agencies perform the surveys. We cannot be sure of what
biases may be created through this decentralized implementation, but it is at least possible that
state-level implementation has caused some of the variance that we see in the data.
To address this possibility we re-estimate model (2) controlling for state fixed effects. Since
there are a relatively few number of metropolitan areas in many states, we will not use these
state-corrected area fixed effects in general. Still, it is important to note the reduction in variance
8

that occurs when we look only at the within-state variance. The standard deviation of 𝑢�𝑗 falls
from 0.043 to 0.017 when we control for state fixed effects as well as demographic controls. The
variance is significantly reduced, but these effects remain statistically distinct from zero. As
such, we conclude that metropolitan differences would persist, even if all the state-level variation
reflected only state-level differences in implementing the BRFSS.
This evidence does not rule out the possibility that these differences reflect unobserved
individual characteristics. One approach to unobserved heterogeneity is to estimate metropolitan
area fixed effects controlling for individual fixed effects. This requires us to use a panel, rather
than a repeated cross-section, which forces us to move from the very large BRFSS to the much
smaller National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). The NSFH is a probability
sample survey of 13,017 respondents in 9,643 households plus an oversampling of minority and
single-family households and households with step-children. The NSFH is a longitudinal study
with three waves, the first between 1987 and 1988, the second between 1992 and 1994, and the
third wave between 2001 and 2002 (Sweet and Bumpass 1996; Sweet, Bumpass, and Call 1988;
Trull and Famularo 1994).
We use data from the first two waves of the NSFH. In both waves, the data contains information
on family and personal characteristics of individuals and on individual subjective well-being. In
particular, the NSFH asks: “First taking things all together, how would you say things are these
days?” Respondents may choose to respond on a 1 to 7 scale, 1 being very unhappy and 7 being
very happy. The summary statistics from this survey are shown in Panels B and C of Table 1. 5
We will later use this measure to examine whether the link between area attributes and wellbeing is stronger for recent migrants or long-term residents. Here, we restrict our attention to the
heterogeneity in subjective well-being across space.
We first estimate adjusted life satisfaction for the merged sample of NSFH waves 1 and 2. The
variance of these estimates is 0.0007, roughly in line with the estimates from the BRFSS. The
raw variation of metropolitan area fixed effects is larger in the NSFH, but the variance correction
is also much larger because the sample size is so much smaller.
We then estimate a PMSA fixed effect variable using the two waves including individual level
fixed effects. The correlation between these estimates and the estimates without the individual
fixed effects is 0.69. The variance of the PMSA fixed effect with individual fixed effects is 0.64.
We conclude from these results that there appears to be significant variation in subjective wellbeing across space, even when we control for unobservable individual-level heterogeneity by
using individual fixed effect estimates.

movers.

2. Do Metropolitan Area Differences in Subjective Well-Being Persist?
Having established the existence of spatial differences in happiness and estimated their
magnitude, we now want to see how they evolve over time. Hypotheses about the temporal
pattern of spatial SWB could range from a completely permanent local characteristic (for
instance, Honolulu has gorgeous weather and is on the beach, which always makes its residents
happy) to a long-term shock common to area-level residents (e.g., the economy in Detroit was
poor and declining during our sample period, making its residents unsatisfied), to an extremely
transitory common shock caused by the weather or local sports outcomes.
We first test the stability of area effects in two ways. First, we run versions of regression (2)
separately for each year, so without year fixed effects:
(3)

(𝑡)

𝑦𝑖𝑗 = 𝜶(𝒕) + 𝑋𝑖𝑗 𝜷(𝒕) + 𝑢𝑗 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗
(𝑡)

We then compare the adjusted life satisfaction estimates across different years (𝑢�𝑗 versus
(𝑡′)

𝑢�𝑗 for 𝑡′ ≠ 𝑡). Our second method is to augment regression (2) by adding an area-year random
effect, 𝑣𝑗𝑡 to the random effects regression:
(4)

𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝜶 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝜷 + 𝜸𝑡 + 𝑢𝑗 + 𝑣𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗

This model estimates the time-invariant area effect, 𝑢𝑗 and the time-varying area effect 𝑣𝑗𝑡
simultaneously. We can test the statistical impact of each of these effects separately, and
quantify the importance of permanent and transitory area effects. For this analysis, we use the
sample of respondents in the 177 MSAs with at least 200 respondents in all years of our sample.
These tests reveal very clearly that the permanent effects are far more important than the
transitory components. When estimating equation (4) without demographic controls, we find
𝜎𝑢 = 0.064 ± 0.004 while 𝜎𝑣 = 0.018 ± 0.002. Thus there is a statistically significant
transitory component, but it varies by 70% less than the permanent area component, and its
standard deviation is around 2% of the individual-level standard deviation. 6
Another way to see this variation is to relate adjusted life satisfaction from regression (3) in one
year to that in another year. Using the measures adjusted for demographic controls from 2005
(2005)

�𝑢�𝑗

(2009)

� and from 2009 �𝑢�𝑗

�, we find an extremely strong positive relationship, with a

correlation of 0.48. Thus one quarter of the variation in adjusted life satisfaction is driven by
permanent metropolitan area level shocks, and the rest by transitory shocks and estimation error.
6

Results are similar when demographic controls are included.

10

Although we have adjusted for the effect of sampling error in computing adjusted life
satisfaction, we should expect to see a correlation less than one if our correction is imperfect.
Hence the random effects results discussed in the previous paragraph give the more accurate
assessment of the relative importance of permanent and transitory components to well-being.
3. Is Urbanization Associated with Happiness or Unhappiness?
One natural question is whether happiness increases or diminishes in large cities. Cities have
often been seen as entities that create financial wealth, but diminish other types of well-being.
We first test this hypothesis by examining the correlation between adjusted life satisfaction and
the logarithm of metropolitan area population. If we use the 2010 population, we find a weak
positive correlation of 0.07. As metropolitan area population increases by one log point, SWB
increases by 0.003 standard deviations and the effect is quite imprecise. We will later show that
in an individual level regression, there is also no significant relationship between area level
population and self-reported well-being, holding individual level characteristics constant.
Using past population levels, instead of current population levels, we find a positive correlation
with population in 2000 and 1990 and a negative correlation with population levels before that
point. The relationship between recent levels of SWB and metropolitan area population before
1960 becomes significantly negative. While larger cities today do not evince significantly lower
levels of unhappiness, residents of cities that were large in the past do seem to be less happy.
We return to this topic later, when we discuss the connection between SWB and population
growth.
Following Stevenson and Wolfers (2008), we now briefly turn to worldwide data. Using the
World Values Survey, we estimate subjected well-being in rural and urban areas in 39 countries
throughout the world. Across the entire sample, we find that the urban happiness is on average
higher than rural happiness. This effect is, however, driven primarily by poorer countries.
Figure 4 shows the correlation between the logarithm of per capita GDP in the country in 2007
and the rural-urban gap in subjective well-being. The coefficient is significantly negative and
the R2 is 0.2. In poorer countries, which often have cities that seem particularly hellish, the
residents of cities say that they are significantly happier than the residents of rural areas. It is
perhaps unsurprising that the developing world is urbanizing so rapidly, as urban residents
appear to be both far better paid and happier.
4. Is Unhappiness Related to Suicide?
While self-reported well-being provides one measure of satisfaction with one’s life, suicide
provides a second, perhaps more tangible, piece of evidence on human misery. It is well known
that unhappiness predicts suicide at the individual level (e.g. Koivumaa-Honkanenet al. 2003),
but the relationship at the aggregate level is far less clear (Daly and Wilson, 2007). As Daly and
Wilson argue, suicide may provide a revealed preference of life satisfaction. If happiness and
11

utility were synonymous, we might expect to see a tight link between suicide and SWB at the
aggregate as well as the individual level.
We have assembled suicide rates across metropolitan areas using the CDC’s National Suicide
Statistics data. These rates also differ significantly across metropolitan areas, but they do not
correlate well with subjective well-being. Indeed, the raw correlation between these measures
and the SWB measure is -0.06, meaning the areas with lower levels of subjective well-being also
have lower levels of suicide.
One explanation for this weak correlation is that suicide relates to the bottom tail of the life
satisfaction distribution, whereas our measures give much weight to middle of the distribution.
To address, this issue we measure only the share of respondents who say their life satisfaction is
in the bottom category (“Very Unhappy”). The weak correlation between this variable and
suicide rates is shown in Figure 5, which corroborates Daly and Wilson’s earlier findings in this
area.
New York City may be the prime example of the mismatch between SWB and suicide. New
York is particularly notable for both its low suicide rates and its low subjective well-being. We
do not think that this implies that subjective well-being is without value as a measure, but rather
that it is likely an incomplete and imperfect measure of economists’ conception of utility. The
economic analysis of suicide (e.g. Becker, 1983) almost always suggests that suicide reflects low
utility levels, and yet high suicide rates do not appear in metropolitan areas where SWB appears
to be low.
There are many reasons why the aggregate relationship between suicide and subjective wellbeing is weak, including measurement error. One interpretation is that these local differences tell
us little, because they are shaped by local reporting norms rather than real differences in life
satisfaction. A second interpretation is that the link between SWB and the economists’ concept
of utility is far from perfect.
5. Unhappiness and Urban Characteristics
We now turn to area-level correlates of self-reported well-being. Most area level attributes are
relatively uncorrelated with subjective well-being, at least once we control for individual level
education.
Table 2 presents these facts using area characteristics as of the year 2000. We use the year 2000
both because it predates our well-being data and because it is the last year with a comprehensive
census. Our core specification includes a bevy of individual attributes that have been found to
correlate with happiness, including education, age, race and family status. We do not include
income or employment controls as these represent outcomes that may be caused by an area’s
economic success. Education and marital status may themselves be determined by the urban

12

environment, and we include regressions both with and without those controls. All regressions
cluster the standard errors at the area-year level and include year and month fixed effects.
Our first regression shows the relationship between the population size of the metropolitan area
and self-reported well-being. When we do not control for education and marital status, the
statistical relationship is small and statistically indistinct from zero. When we include these
more endogenous controls, the relationship becomes more negative and statistically significant.
In the third regression, we control for the share of the adult population in the area with a college
degree. Using the fixed effects estimated without controlling for individual level education, this
variable is strongly positive. Using the fixed effects estimated conditional on these controls, the
variable’s estimated effect drops by two-thirds and it becomes statistically indistinct from zero.
Regressions (5) and (6) examine the share of the adult population with a college degree. The
picture is much the same as with the other education variable. The coefficient is large and
statistically significant when we control only for area level attributes but not when we control for
area-level education. These regressions can be interpreted as suggesting that area level education
boosts self-reported well-being by increasing individual educational attainment, or that area level
education has no independent effect.
Regressions (7) and (8) examine racial segregation, as measured by a standard dissimilarity
index. In this case, we also interact segregation with a dummy variable that takes on a value of
one if the individual is black. Both with and without individual controls, segregation is
negatively associated with well-being and this effect is approximately twice as large for AfricanAmericas as for whites.
Regressions (9) and (10) are our most fully saturated specifications. In these we control for all of
the metropolitan area variables, and the full set of individual level controls. We also interact
segregation with all of the race categories. In regression ten, we add state fixed effects.
Regression nine shows results that are similar to the other specifications. Share of the population
with a college degree has a positive effect on self-reported happiness, although share of the
population with a high school degree has a negative relationship. Segregation continues to have
a negative connection to self-reported well-being, and this effect is much stronger for AfricanAmericans. In this specification, housing value has a somewhat surprisingly negative but
insignificant effect on subjective well-being.
Column ten includes state fixed effects and is our most complete specification. As many states
have only one metropolitan area, this reduces our effective sample and eliminates any variation
that represents larger regional trends. In this specification, the positive effect of college
education remains, and the effect of high school graduates becomes positive. Housing values
now have a negative, significant, relationship with happiness, while segregation is insignificant.

13

Putting together these results, we draw two tentative conclusions. There is some possibility that
individuals report higher levels of well-being in more educated areas, although this is true only
when we include a full range of area controls, or when we fail to control for individual level
education. Segregation is associated with lower levels of subjective well-being, but only when
we don’t control for state fixed effects. Overall, these results do not suggest a robust series of
correlations between urban attributes and SWB.

II.

Unhappiness and Urban Decline

We now turn to the particularly striking correlation between urban unhappiness and decline
(Glaeser and Redlick, 2009, Lucas, 2013). We first examine linear specifications and then allow
the impact of population growth on subjective well-being to have a piecewise linear shape. We
will focus on changes in the logarithms of population and median household income between
1950 and 2000. We first focus on the BRFSS and then turn to the NSFH and the GSS, which
enable us to look at movers and estimate equations with individual fixed effects.
Linear Effects of Population Growth and Income
Table 3 presents our first set of results on the correlation between SWB and urban change. The
first three regressions show results for population change. The next three regressions show
results for income change. The final two regressions show results for both variables together and
include other area-level controls.
The first regression shows the relationship between population change and self-reported wellbeing controlling for individual attributes. The coefficient of 0.087 implies that a 1 log point
increase in population growth is associated with a one-twelfth of a standard deviation increase in
self-reported well-being. The second regression controls for the more endogenous individual
characteristics. The coefficient on population change remains statistically significant, but it falls
in magnitude by about one-third. The third regression controls for state fixed effects. In this
case, the coefficient falls to about one-third of its value in the first regression, although it retains
statistical significance.
Regressions four through six look at income change instead of population change. In a sense,
this is the local version of the classic Easterlin (1974) work on income change and happiness.
Regression four shows a strong positive relationship between income growth and self-reported
well-being. The coefficient is somewhat larger than that on population growth, but since the
variation of income growth is smaller, the impact of a one-standard deviation change in income
growth is actually smaller than the impact of a one-standard deviation change in population
growth.

14

In regression 5, we add our controls for more endogenous individual attributes. As in the case of
population change, the estimated coefficient falls by about one-third. In regression 6, we add
state level controls. As before, the coefficient drops by another fifty percent, but it does remain
statistically significant.
Regressions seven and eight include both variables and other area level controls. In regression
seven, both change variables remain statistically significant. The coefficients are modest but
continue to suggest that growth is associated with positive levels of well-being. The only of the
other controls that is statistically distinct from zero is segregation, which remains negative.
In regression eight, we also include state fixed effects. Because BRFSS is administered at the
state level and there could be important differences in the survey’s implementation, we would
like to adjust for any such differences. State fixed effects accomplish that. On the other hand,
the fixed effects may be over-controlling in important ways, because they eliminate regional
variation from our estimates. Our map of adjusted happiness (Figure 2) shows clear regional
patterns, and the state fixed effects partial out that variation and more. With this caveat, column
8 shows the same regression as column 7, but adding state fixed effects. These fixed effects
eliminate the otherwise robust relationship between urban growth and subjective well-being. But
unfortunately they do not tell us whether this reflects different modes of implementing the
BRFSS or is simply because the bulk of geographic differences in subjective well-being are
regional in nature.
As we will see in the next sub-section, it turns out that the growth-happiness relationship is
driven by the lower end of the city growth distribution. This part of the relationship remains
extremely robust to state fixed effects, reducing the importance of distinguishing between
columns 7 and 8 of Table 3.
The Non-Linear Relationship between Unhappiness and Population Growth
Figure 6 shows the correlation between population growth and adjusted life satisfaction. As the
figure makes clear, the effect is much stronger at the lower end of the population change
distribution. Low levels of happiness are particularly common in areas that are declining in
population, but higher levels of happiness are not especially prevalent in areas where population
is growing rapidly.
There are several hypotheses that could explain this non-linearity. For example, if decline is
actually causing unhappiness—rather than merely being correlated with it—it might be that
decline itself creates urban stresses, relative to stasis, but that urban growth doesn’t particularly
alleviate those stresses. Declining cities, such as Detroit, often find it difficult to cover the costs
of their historic footprint and infrastructure. Decline may be particularly associated with
crumbling social or physical infrastructure. It could also be that happiness is caused by other
attributes that cause decline, but that among growing cities, the differences come mainly from

15

differences in housing supply and economic productivity, which perhaps have little impact on
happiness.
Whatever the cause, the non-linear relationship is obvious in the data. Table 4 shows the
connection between SWB and urban growth in the BRFSS, where we have allowed the break in
the slope to occur at a value of 0.75, the median for our sample of metropolitan areas. The first
regression shows that controlling for exogenous demographic controls, the coefficient on growth,
when growth is below the median is 0.214, meaning that a 0.5 change in log population growth is
associated with a 0.1 standard deviation increase in SWB. The result is extremely significant
and remains so in the second regression, where we include the endogenous demographic
controls. In this second regression, the coefficient drops to 0.134, meaning that a 0.5 change in
log population growth is associated with a 0.065 standard deviation increase in SWB. This is
roughly equivalent to one standard deviation of the metropolitan area fixed effects, and roughly
equivalent to the difference in SWB between high school graduates and individuals who have
some college education.
In regression 3, we include controls for income and employment status. While we recognize
endogeneity of these outcomes with respect to local labor market conditions, we still think it is
worthwhile knowing whether the connection between urban decline and unhappiness disappears
when we control for them. In this case, the coefficient falls to 0.101. In regression four, we
control for health status (including both a general question about overall health status and a
question about days spent ill over the past year). The coefficient falls to 0.097 and remains quite
statistically significant. In our last specification, we add state fixed effects, but exclude the
health and income questions, and estimate a coefficient of 0.078. Appendix Table 3
demonstrates that the relationship in this final column is robust to numerous other functional
forms for the non-linearity.
In all cases, the coefficient is robust statistically and the magnitudes remain quite similar. While
it is certainly true that controlling for education and family status significantly reduces the
estimate coefficient, other individual controls change the coefficient only slightly. We believe
that this suggests that this effect is less likely to reflect unobserved heterogeneity, but to address
that issue we turn to the NSFH.
Urban Decline and Unhappiness with Movers and Stayers
We now ask whether the unhappiness of declining cities appears to be limited to longer term
residents and whether these results remain when we control for individual fixed effects. Table 5
shows our results using the NSFH.
In its first two waves, the NSFH is a clean panel that can in principle enable us to look at SWB
for people who move between areas. Unfortunately, the third wave of the NSFH does not have
geographic identifiers and that prevents us from examining movers. We address two issues
using these data. First, we examine the impact of decline on SWB using individual fixed effects,
16

so our identification comes from individuals who move across areas. Second, we focus on the
second wave and examine whether decline has smaller or larger effects for individuals who have
moved since the first wave. Two significant challenges with the NSFH are that the samples are
small and the time between the first and second waves is small (under five years). This means
that the number of movers is smaller still.
The first regression shows the effect of the population growth spline with exogenous
demographic controls. The coefficient is 0.14, somewhat smaller than in the BRFSS, but the
question is different and the controls are not identical. In the second regression, we add
endogenous demographic controls and find an estimate of 0.108, which is similar in magnitude
to the BRFSS. The third regression adds income and employment controls, and the coefficient
actually rises to 0.121. In those years, incomes were higher rather than lower in declining cities.
In the fourth regression, we look only at observations in the second wave of the NSFH, so that
we can estimate whether the coefficient on decline is different for individuals who moved into
the metropolitan area between the first and second wave. The coefficient on decline for stayers
is roughly the same as the coefficients in the first three regressions. The interaction between the
decline measure and being a mover is negative, meaning that decline is less strongly associated
with unhappiness for the movers. However, while the interaction is not small, it is not distinct
from zero. It is difficult to conclude much from this regression.
In the fifth regression, we include individual fixed effects and the correlation with urban decline
vanishes. After examining a figure looking at the correlation between the area happiness fixed
effects and growth, we noticed that there were a number of extremely small cities which had
movers with strikingly large changes in subjective well-being.
In the sixth regression, we include only areas that had at least 250 respondents across two NSFH
waves, which perhaps increases our confidence that this sample reflects a random sample of the
city. In this case, we find the same non-linearity as we did previously, although both the
standard error and the coefficients have increased. The fragility of these results leaves us with
no certain conclusion, and regression four leaves open the interpretation that unobserved
heterogeneity drives the results. But the result from regression five also makes it quite possible
to conclude that there are differences between growing and declining cities even after controlling
for individual fixed effects.
One possible explanation for the relationship between decline and unhappiness is selective
migration. Individuals who leave declining cities may be happier than their neighbors, or
growing cities may attract individuals who are happier than the population as a whole. The panel
nature of the NSFH allows us to test this hypothesis. In Table 6, we focus on the 1513
individuals in our sample who moved MSAs between waves 1 and 2.
Columns one and two use the entire NSFH sample, in order to test whether individual and PMSA
characteristics in wave 1 predict whether an individual moves between waves 1 and 2. Both
17

columns control for subjective well-being in wave 1, the PSMA population growth spline of an
individual’s wave 1 PMSA, our standard set of exogenous and endogenous individual controls as
well as income in wave 1. In column one, the upper part of the population growth spline is
positively predictive of mover status, reflecting the high degree of population churn in the upper
tail of growing cities. Subjective well-being in wave 1 is not predictive of whether an individual
will move between waves 1 and 2.
Column two adds an interaction between individual wave 1 subjective well-being and the
population growth spline. Subjective well-being is now marginally positive and significant.
Critically, the interaction between the lower spline and subjective well-being is negative and
significant. Happier people are less likely to leave declining cities, relative to rising cities. Put
another way, we can reject the hypothesis that the happiest individuals are selectively moving
out of declining areas.
In columns three and four, we test for the hypothesis that happier migrants select growing cities.
We focus on the 935 movers in our sample for which we have data on PMSA population for
waves 1 and 2. In column three, we use our set of exogenous controls, wave 1 individual
subjective well-being, and wave 1 PMSA population growth spline. In column four, we add
controls for wave 1 endogenous individual characteristics and income. Although we cannot
reject a positive relationship between wave 1 subjective well-being and wave 2 PMSA
population growth, we find no evidence for selection of individuals with higher subjective wellbeing into growing cities.
Finally, columns five and six analogously assess whether happier migrants select happier cities
using data from all 1513 movers in the NSFH. In this specification, we also find little
connection between wave 1 “happiness” for movers and choosing, conditional upon moving, to
relocate to a happier locale. In Column six, we add controls for endogenous characteristics and
income in wave 1. The positive relationship between wave 1 and wage 2 subjective well-being
decreases in size and continues to be insignificant. The data does not support the hypothesis that
unhappy migrants move to declining or unhappy cities, but the results are not strong enough to
reject the possibility of selective migration.
Table 7 now turns to a different data set, the General Social Survey (GSS). The public version of
the GSS contains state name and city level population. These two variables enable us to predict
the population decline in the area with a fairly high degree of accuracy for the overwhelming
majority of data points.
In regression one we again estimate the spline controlling for exogenous individual attributes,
this time in the GSS. We continue to find a strong positive relationship between growth and
happiness for the areas where growth rates are below the sample median. The second regression
adds additional (potential endogenous) controls, such as income and family size, and the
coefficient declines only slightly. The third regression interacts these variables with an indicator
18

variable denoting whether the individual has moved across metropolitan areas since age 16. The
interaction between this variable and population decline is negative, but very close to zero. In
this larger sample, we see little evidence suggesting that the unhappiness associated with urban
decline is limited to longer term residents.
Can Urban Disamenities Explain the Correlation between Unhappiness and Urban Decline?
In Table 8, we ask whether observable urban disamenities can explain the correlation between
unhappiness and urban decline. We return to our core BRFSS specification, with exogenous but
not endogenous individual controls, and include correlates of decline one at a time to test
whether these variables reduce the coefficient on urban decline. While none of these estimates
can be taken as being causal, they represent a rough pass at judging whether the correlation
between decline and happiness merely represents the correlation between decline and some other
more important variable.
Our first control is January temperature. The correlation between warm weather and
metropolitan growth is well known (Glaeser and Tobio, 2009), and it is certainly possible that
tough winters are depressing. While Oswald and Wu (2010) find that climate has a significant
relationship with self-reported happiness, we find no connection in our specification once we
have controlled for population growth non-linearly. Moreover, this control does little to the
estimated coefficient on population decline.
Our second climate variable is precipitation, measured in annual inches of rain. Again, as the
second regression in the table shows, this variable has little correlation with SWB in our data and
does little to the coefficient on decline. The third variable we test is the log of the number of
serious crimes per capita, and again it has little significance and only moderately reduces the
estimated coefficient. Some of this change reflects the slightly smaller sample of metropolitan
areas for which we have crime data. While being victimized may certainly make someone
unhappy, it seems quite possible that crime is sufficiently concentrated in certain population
subgroups that it has little impact on average happiness.
The fourth variable captures pollution, which might well be higher in America’s erstwhile
industrial heartland. We have tried many difference measures of local pollution levels, but none
of them correlate well with happiness. Regression four shows total particulates (mean of 10
micron particulate matter, from 2000) and it has little correlation with happiness and does little to
change the connection between SWB and urban decline.
Our fifth variable is the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality as of the year 2000.
While Alesina, Di Tella and MacCulloch (2004) find that happiness decreases with inequality,
especially in Europe, we find a slight positive relationship between happiness and inequality
across U.S. metropolitan areas. Moreover, controlling for inequality does little to change the
estimated impact of population decline on unhappiness. The weak connection between

19

inequality and SWB in the BRFSS is somewhat odd, because it is quite strong in the General
Social Survey (Glaeser, Resseger and Tobio, 2010).
In the sixth regression, we see that including all of the variables reduces the coefficient on the
decline from 0.21 to 0.156. Adding the endogenous demographic controls causes the coefficient
to drop further to 0.08. This coefficient should be compared with the Table 3 coefficient of
0.134, which is the effect of decline on happiness without these other amenity controls, but with
endogenous demographics. Finally, in the last regression, we include state fixed effects, which
changes the coefficients on some of the area amenity controls but have little impact on
population growth coefficients.

Is the Unhappiness of Declining Cities New or Old?
Historical data can help us assess whether the relationship between unhappiness and decline
reflects the impact of decline itself, or whether these now declining cities were historically
defined more by productivity than by pleasure. According to the first view, Detroit was once a
place of happiness as well as prosperity, but as the prosperity declined, and the social problems
increased, unhappiness spread. According to the second view, Detroit was unhappy even during
its heyday, but historically, its residents were well compensated for their joylessness. Capital
and labor were historically located in the city because it had natural advantages, such as access to
waterways that made up for the loss in happiness.
The era of comprehensive urban happiness measures really only began ten years ago with the
BRFSS. The NSFH goes back twenty years, but even that is a relatively short historical window.
To investigate the more distant past, we turn to two data sets the General Social Survey (or GSS)
and Gallup polls from the 1940s. The GSS has the advantage of allowing relatively
comprehensive personal controls, but it dates only back to the early 1970s. The Gallup samples
are small, do not include metropolitan area identifiers, and contain only limited number of
personal controls.
Our approach is to estimate the impact of area-level population change and then to examine how
this effect changes over the decades. We do this using the General Social Survey in the last three
regressions of Table 7. We again estimate a spline for population growth, but we interact the
coefficients on that spline with indicator variables that represent each decade. The population
growth is defined over the entire 1950-2000 period, but the interactions allow the connection
between decline and happiness to differ across the decades.
In Regression 4, we control for standard demographic variables and a year trend variable. As the
regression shows, the interaction is strongly negative after the 1970s, meaning that the
correlation between unhappiness and decline has decreased over time. Indeed, by the 2000s, the
connection has disappeared entirely, which is of course, not what we observed in the BRFSS.
20

This shows that the cities that are declining over the entire period were unhappier in the 1970s,
relative to other areas, than they were after 2000. These results are compatible with the view that
unhappiness caused the decline or that declining cities have long-standing attributes associated
with unhappiness, but they seem don’t seem compatible with the view that unhappiness has
grown following decades of decline.
Regression five of Table 7 includes controls for the endogenous demographics. While the
overall negative relationship weakens, the time pattern is unchanged. The sixth regression
includes controls for income and unemployment. Again, the basic time pattern remains clear.
Declining cities were even unhappier in the past than they are today.
We now turn to our Gallup poll results. These results use three polls from the 1940s. The
questions asked (detailed in the Data Appendix) are not precisely the same as the other SWB
surveys, so magnitudes may not be easy to compare. Nonetheless, this survey provides us with
our only window onto the more distant past. The Gallup poll provides us with two area-level
pieces of information that we use in our regressions. We know the broad city-size categories
inhabited by the residents. We also use the state. We use the information both by estimating a
basic city-size effect and interacting city size with a dummy variable indicating whether the
metropolitan areas in the state had population or income growth below the median level in the
overall sample.
We have four regressions in our sample. The first regression shows the basic effect of city size.
Residents of cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants were about four percent less likely to say
that they were less happy in the 1940s. This supports the idea that big cities during this era had
lower levels of subjective well-being.
In regression two, we add a low population growth dummy and interact city size with this
dummy. In regression three we do the same with a low income growth dummy, and in
regression four we use a low temperature dummy. The results are deeply inconclusive. Table 9
shows only the dummy variables for each regression, as none of the interactions are statistically
significant. This is partially because the Gallup sample includes very few people in the sunbelt
metropolises that grew over the next decades. Yet overall, larger cities (as opposed to larger
metropolitan areas), did typically decline dramatically between 1950 and 2000. In all four
regressions, residents of cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants were four to six percent less
likely to say they were happy in the 1940s. The results of these regressions coincide with the fact
that eight of the ten largest U.S. cities in 1950 lost at least one-fourth of their population over the
next 50 years. We believe that these Gallup results again support the view that the large cities of
the 1940s, which typically did decline, were also places marked by somewhat lower happiness
levels.
These results are hardly definitive, but taken together they suggest that urban unhappiness is not
exclusively recent. The GSS shows larger results in the past than in the present. The Gallup
21

results show little connection between happiness and urban growth, but they do support the idea
that happiness was lower in large cities in the 1940s, and most of those cities have subsequently
declined.
These results correspond to results we can see in the BRFSS estimates. The correlation between
the logarithm of metropolitan area population in 2010 and adjusted life satisfaction is 0.03. The
correlation between that same happiness outcome and the log of area population in 1950 is -0.28.

III.

Why Does Happiness Differ Across Space?

If self-reported happiness has any equivalence to the economist’s concept of utility, then
modestly enduring differences in self-reported life satisfaction seem to challenge the view that
migration and the free operation of housing markets ensure that utility levels are equalized across
space. Alternatively, if there are persistent differences in subjective well-being for identical
people across space and a spatial equilibrium does hold, then this would imply that subjective
well-being is just not equivalent to the economists’ conception of utility.
Perhaps the differences that we measured above may not really represent differences in
subjective well-being among otherwise identical human beings. The residents of declining cities
may have less marketable skills, of various forms, than residents of growing cities, and as such,
they would naturally earn less and have lower levels of life-satisfaction or utility in any
metropolitan area. Yet our results control for a bevy of individual characteristics and controlling
for added metropolitan area level variables, including the percent with college degrees or the
share of the population that is white, only modestly reduces the relationship between decline and
self-reported life satisfaction. The estimated relationship actually increases in magnitude if we
restrict our samples to metropolitan areas with relatively similar levels of college graduates. 7
Finally, while the individual fixed effects results on urban decline were inconclusive outside of
the larger cities, there are still significant differences in SWB across cities when we control for
individual fixed effects.
It is also possible that individuals on the margin of moving across areas receive the same
welfare, but that infra-marginal individuals differ in their average level of well-being across
space. Yet for this view to be correct, we would need an explanation of why the average inframarginal welfare in declining areas is significant lower than in growing areas, even if the
marginal happiness levels are the same.

7

The coefficient when our happiness variable is regressed on the change in population between 1950 and 2000 is
0.023. When we control for share of the population with college degrees and percent white, the coefficient drops to
0.02. When we restrict our sample to metropolitan areas in which twenty-to-thirty percent of adults have college
degrees, then the coefficient rises to 0.031.

22

Another interpretation is that when equivalent individuals made location decisions, their
expected happiness was equal across space, but ex post some migrants have fared worse than
others, either because they were bad at projecting the happiness that different places bring, or
because some areas have received particularly adverse shocks. According to this view, ex post
welfare differs across space, even though ex ante welfare does not. But if this view is correct,
then the connection between urban decline and unhappiness should exist primarily for longer
term residents of the area, such as people who are unlikely enough to be born in metropolitan
areas in decline, not recent migrants. Yet as we have discussed, the connection between
unhappiness and urban decline is stronger for individuals who chose to come to the area as adults
than for individuals who were born into the area. Moreover, given the well-advertised urban
problems of many declining cities such as Detroit, it is hard to imagine that migrants are all that
surprised—although it is certainly true that there are general problems in forecasting happiness
(Gilbert, 2006; Kahneman and Krueger, 2006).
Is Happiness a Measure of Utility?
While admitting that the preceding facts are open to multiple interpretations, we focus on one
particular interpretation: individuals maximize neither happiness nor life satisfaction, and for the
right reward, are willing to sacrifice both. According to this view, individuals in less happy
areas are foregoing well-being in order to gain some other advantage. This view does not
suggest that SWB and happiness are meaningless concepts. Surely a sense of well-being is
desirable. But we consider the view where their meaning has little in common with the
economists’ conception of utility, which is merely a representation of choice. In standard
microeconomic theory, an outcome yields higher utility if and only if it is preferred.
The debate over whether individuals either do or should maximize happiness or SWB is ancient
and intellectually rich. Bentham (1789) famously wrote that “Nature has placed mankind under
the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out
what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do.” Bentham’s claim is that
happiness is both the positive and normative determinant of behavior. He greatly influenced
subsequent 19th century economists such as John Stuart Mill, who wrote, “The creed which
accepts as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that
actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce
the reverse of happiness.”
These economists are reflecting a far more ancient philosophical tradition. Socrates’ student
Aristippus founded the Cyrenaic School, which taught a strongly hedonistic philosophy,
emphasizing pleasure as life’s central goal. The later Epicureans shared some of these views,
although Epicurus thought that pleasure was achieved by simple modesty rather than riotous
living. In his letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus writes “When we say, then, that pleasure is the end

23

and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality.” 8 Giants of
medieval philosophy, including Augustine and Aquinas, also accepted that human beings
pursued happiness above all, but taught that true happiness is to be found by following God’s
will.
Some modern researchers on happiness, though certainly not all, have also often conflated
happiness with utility (Alesina, Di Tella and MacCulloch, 2004) or at least social welfare
(Easterlin, 1995). 9 Yet it is quite possible to believe that happiness is interesting and important,
without accepting the equivalence. There is also an equally ancient and distinguished
philosophical tradition that strongly rejects the notion that individuals either do or should
maximize happiness.
While the Epicureans believed strongly in maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, the Stoics
certainly did not. About 1900 years ago, Epictetus wrote “What is our nature? To be free, noble,
self-respecting….We must subordinate pleasure to these principles, to minister to them as a
servant.” Epictetus is at least making the normative claim that there are other goals—freedom,
nobility, self-respect—that distinctly trump happiness. Kant, similarly, argued that morality
called us to try to be worthy of happiness, but that happiness itself did not automatically flow
from the morality that should be humanity’s ultimate goal.
For at least a century, mainstream economists have moved away from equating utility with
happiness. Fisher (1892) wrote “It is not necessary for [the economist] to take sides with those
who wrangle to prove or disprove that pleasure and pain alone determine conduct.” Stigler
(1950) noted that “the one changing element in the general knowledge was the growing
skepticism of hedonism in academic circles.” More recently, Becker and Rayo (2008) wrote,
“These examples suggest an alternative interpretation of the happiness data, namely, that
happiness is a commodity in the utility function in the same way that owning a car and being
healthy are.”
8

In the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle urged the pursuit of “Eudaimonia”, which has been translated as happiness.
For example, Browne (1889) translates Aristotle as writing “Happiness, then, appears something perfect and selfsufficient, being the end of all human actions.” Other scholars, however, contend that the word, which combines
the roots of good and spirit, should be not be seen as equivalent to happiness.
9
Alesina et al. (2014, p. 2010) explicitly state that they “measure ‘utility’ in terms of survey answers about
‘happiness’.” They elaborate in footnote 7 that they, and in their view much of the literature on economics of
happiness, aim to measure “experienced utility, a concept that emphasizes the pleasures derived from consumption”.
They view these survey responses, in certain circumstances, as “reasonable substitutes to observing individual
choices” (footnote 7, p. 2012). Many other prominent papers in this literature implicitly posit such an equivalence,
such as Easterlin (1995, p. 36). Easterlin writes, “Formally, this model corresponds to a model of interdependent
preferences in which each individual’s utility or subjective well-being varies directly with his or her own income
and inversely with the average income of others.”
Of course the literature has also considered many subtle points about the appropriate conception of
subjective well-being. For example, Kahneman and Thaler (1991) and Kahneman and Krueger (2006) distinguish
between decision utility and experienced utility. We certainly do not claim to introduce a novel distinction here.
Our contribution, in part, is to use the decision-utility maximization embodied in spatial equilibrium to put more
structure on the theoretical and empirical relationships between choices and subjective well-being.

24

Perhaps the most obvious piece of evidence supporting Becker and Rayo’s interpretation is the
fact that parents of small children typically report unusually low levels of happiness or life
satisfaction (Baumeister, 1991). If happiness were equivalent to utility, then presumably this
relationship should act as a great deterrent against the survival of the species. Yet in Becker and
Rayo’s formulation, this negative relationship is no puzzle at all, as parents receive ample
compensation in the form of progeny, for their suffering.
Some suggest that in its very wording, life satisfaction should capture all the elements of utility.
While it seems wildly implausible to hope that maximizing utility should automatically mean
maximizing joy or happiness, it is more conceivable that individuals answer the question about
life satisfaction in such a way that actually ranks their preferred outcomes, as does a utility
function. In this case, an individual who has received a more preferred outcome will report a
higher level of life satisfaction. Hence utility and subjective well-being become one and the
same, even though they are not themselves the ultimate desiderata, because they act as a
thermometer which measure how well people have achieved their goals.
Yet, upon reflection, this view seems barely more tenable than the view that happiness should
miraculously map into with human preferences. An individual may choose a more competitive
environment with more opportunity to shape the world, and yet know that this world will – by
opening up opportunities and inviting comparisons with high achievers—lead to less satisfaction
later in life. A utility-maximizing person could select a Ph.D. program, or a city, despite
recognizing that it will leads to less satisfaction.
Among all members of the classical economic tradition, Bernard de Mandeville, may be the most
powerful proponent of the view that human beings should not maximize happiness, especially
not in location choice. In The Fable of the Bees, he writes “To be happy is to be pleas’d, and the
less Notion a Man has of a better way of Living, the more content he’ll be with his own… the
greater a Man’s Knowledge and Experience is in the World, the more exquisite the Delicacy of
his Taste, and the more consummate Judge he is of things in general, certainly the more difficult
it will be to please him….But when a Man enjoys himself, Laughs and Sings, and in his Gesture
and Behaviour shews me all the tokens of Content and Satisfaction, I pronounce him happy, and
have nothing to do with his Wit or Capacity.” Clearly, de Mandeville thinks little of happiness.
When he writes “ask’d where I thought it was most probable that Men might enjoy true
Happiness, I would prefer a small peaceable Society, in which Men, neither envy’d nor esteem’d
by Neighbours, should be contented to live upon the Natural Product of the Spot they inhabit, to
a vast Multitude abounding in Wealth and Power,” he is not espousing such places, but arguing
that it is perfectly sensible to choose busier, but less happy, locales.
We do not mean to suggest that happiness isn’t desirable, and for that reason, if the spatial
equilibrium logic of Rosen (1976) and Roback (1979) is correct, then there must be some sort of
compensation offsetting the unhappiness of declining cities. Individuals must be receiving some
other benefit, such as higher real wages, that offset the costs of lower life-satisfaction.
25

Otherwise, it would be hard to understand why individuals remain in unhappy cities. We
formalize these issues in the model that follows.
Happiness and Utility
To formalize this discussion, we begin with a general framework meant to capture the difference
between happiness and utility. We then adapt our structure to deal with cities and urban decline,
which requires considerably more assumptions about structure and ultimately even functional
forms. This latter section puts forward the model that will be taken to the data in Section IV.
In Becker (1966), individuals maximize a function 𝑈(∙) defined over a vector of objectives 𝑍�,
where each element in that vector 𝑍𝑖 is a function of time spent (𝑡𝑖 ) and spending (𝑠𝑖 ). One
possible approach is to assume that life satisfaction is defined over an alternative function 𝐻(∙)
of those same objectives, but that approach provides little guidance for modeling or testable
implications.
We assume that subjective well-being represents an alternative function 𝑊(∙) over the same set
of objectives. It may be that welfare is a function of well-being and other objectives, or that
well-being is simply a slightly different function of exactly the same inputs that guide utility. In
the first case, utility can be described as 𝑈�𝑊�𝑍��, 𝑍�𝑁𝐻 �, where 𝑍�𝑁𝐻 refers to those objectives
that enter into utility directly, such as child-rearing, as well as possibly also impacting wellbeing.
We will approach well-being and utility as reflecting a combination of experiences and
achievements. Well-being or happiness, will be conceived as experience-based utility, following
Bentham (1789) and Kahneman and Krueger (2006). Individuals care about experienced utility,
but they also care about achievements, which can also be produced with time and money. We
lose little generality by assuming at this point that there is a single achievement, which is
produced with achievement-specific time denoted 𝑡𝐴 and achievement-specific spending 𝑠𝐴 .
Individual earnings are the product of wages and time spent working 𝑤𝑡𝑤 and unearned income
𝑦0 , which includes the fixed cost of housing.

Both time spent working and time pursuing the alternative achievement convey experienced
utility per unit time of 𝑡𝑤 and 𝑡𝐴 respectively. The remainder of hedonic time generates wellbeing equal to ℎ(𝑠ℎ )𝑡ℎ , where 𝑠ℎ reflects the total amount of spending on these activities. The
term ℎ(𝑠ℎ )𝑡ℎ is meant to be an aggregate of all other time, and even includes sleeping.
The individual’s problem can thus be written as maximizing:
(5) 𝑈(ℎ𝑤 𝑡𝑤 + ℎ𝑎 𝑡𝑎 + ℎ(𝑠ℎ )𝑡ℎ , 𝑍(𝑠𝑎 , 𝑡𝑎 ))

subject to the time budget constraint 𝑡𝑤 + 𝑡𝑎 + 𝑡ℎ = 1 (we have normalized the total time
available to equal one) and the cash budget constraint 𝑤𝑡𝑤 + 𝑦0 = 𝑠ℎ + 𝑠𝑎 . The two budget
26

constraints can be combined to create a single total budget constraint of 𝑤 + 𝑦0 = 𝑤(𝑡𝑎 + 𝑡ℎ ) +
𝑠𝑎 + 𝑠ℎ .

In this model, as in almost all economic models, more income is preferred to less, and translates
into higher levels of utility. Yet the link between happiness and wages is less clear. If, for
example, 𝑍(∙) is produced entirely with earnings, then as long as the uncompensated wage
elasticity is positive, happiness diminishes with wages even though utility increases. If ℎ(𝑠ℎ ) =
ℎ0 is independent of income, then the derivative of happiness with respect to the wage equals
(ℎ0 − ℎ𝑤 ) times the derivative of 𝑡ℎ with respect to the wage, which equals

−(𝑈𝐻𝐻 (ℎ0 −ℎ𝑤 )2 −2(ℎ0 −ℎ𝑤 )𝑤𝑍′(𝑠𝑎 )𝑈𝐻𝑍 +(𝑤𝑍′(𝑠𝑎 ))2 𝑈𝑍𝑍 )

Across space, the impact of income on happiness may be even more negative. Suppose that
amenities are constant across space, and that utility levels are unchanged with changes in wages;
𝜕𝑦0
𝜕𝑤

= −(1 − 𝐼𝑡0 ): the change in housing costs exactly offsets the change in earnings. If this is

the case, then in the case discussed above, where spending does not impact the hedonic flow of
time, then

< 0, so happiness is always

lower in higher wage cities. Since the impact of area level wages is a compensated, rather than
an uncompensated change in wages, it will invariably cause an increase in hours worked and a
decrease in time spent in household production.
We now turn to the spatial equilibrium, where we assume that ℎ𝑤 = ℎ𝑎 = 0. We also assume a
Cobb-Douglas utility function, with a weight of 𝛼 on happiness, and power functions for
producing the other goods, and that 𝑍(𝑠𝑎 , 𝑡𝑎 ) = 𝑧0 (𝑠𝑎 )𝑧 (𝑡𝑎 )1−𝑧 , where 𝑧0 is a city-specific
production shifter. We assume that time spent at work is fixed at 𝑡̂𝑤 but that time can still be
allocated between leisure and the other achievement. Further, ℎ(𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 + 𝑦0 ) = ℎ0 (𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 + 𝑦0 )𝛾 ,
where ℎ0 is a city-specific amenity. Given these assumptions, then indirect utility is
proportional to (ℎ0 )𝛼 (𝑧0 )1−𝛼 (𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 + 𝑦0 )𝛼𝛾+(1−𝛼)𝑧 and happiness is proportional to ℎ0 (𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 +
𝑦0 )𝛾 .
The Cobb-Douglas welfare function generates a happiness-income tradeoff of

−

1−𝛼
𝛼

𝑑 log(𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠)
𝑑 log(𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒)

. This tradeoff is a distinct concept from the derivative of happiness with respect to the

wage (assuming unearned income is negligible), which equals 𝛾.

=

We have two options here, choosing fixed or flexible working time, but the simpler functional
forms come with fixed hours. In that case, the spatial equilibrium condition can be written as:
−

(7) 𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 + 𝑦0 = 𝑘0 ℎ0

𝛼
𝛼𝛾+(1−𝛼)𝑧

−

𝑧0

.
27

The values of ℎ0 and 𝑧0 are determined both by natural amenities, such as climate, and amenities
tied to public services, such as safety. Declining areas could well have lower levels of quality of
life both because they are in relatively cold areas of the U.S. and because a reduced level of
spending leads to lower levels of public amenities.
An urban equilibrium involves three separate equations. The first is the spatial equilibrium curve
for consumers in which welfare—but not happiness—must equal a constant reservation utility
across space. The second condition is that firm profits are equalized across space. The third
condition is that the cost of housing equals the cost of supplying homes.
We assume a linear housing supply curve, so that the flow cost of housing in a city, denoted r, is
𝑟 = 𝑐0 + 𝑐1 log(𝑁𝑡 ) + 𝑐2 log(𝑁𝑡 /𝑁𝑡−1 ), where 𝑁𝑡 reflects the population in the place, and we
assume that 𝑦0 = −𝑟. This can be generated by an assumption that houses are created with a
Cobb-Douglas utility function using traded and non-traded capital, where non-traded capital is in
fixed supply. In principle, 𝑐0 , 𝑐1 and 𝑐2 might all vary across areas.

Finally, we have linear labor demand so that 𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 = 𝐴 − 𝐵 log(𝑁𝑡 ). This can be generated by
assuming that there are a fixed number of firms with Cobb-Douglas production functions and
two types of labor, one of which is traded and the other is not (Glaeser, 2007). Again, A and B
might differ across metropolitan areas.
Using the housing supply curve, labor demand curve, and taking logs of equation (7) yields:

Population is increasing with productivity, decreasing with the cost of providing housing and
increasing with the two amenity variables. Income is rising with productivity and the costs of
supply housing and falling with the two amenity variables. Housing rents increase with
productivity, with the cost of housing and with the two amenity variables. Happiness is rising
with the happiness-related amenity and declining with the non-happiness related amenity. This
becomes a four equation system for empirical work, where the impacts of local variables can be
traced through these four distinct outcomes.
In this formulation, happiness is a measure of local amenities—and local amenities only—
because population and housing prices adjust to shifts in local demand and construction costs.
28

The spatial equilibrium requires that gaps in real income end up being proportional to happiness,
holding as such happiness should be declining in real income. The slope is predicted to equal
(1−𝛼)𝑧
𝛼

on real income, which equals

(1−𝛼)
𝛼

—the basic happiness income tradeoff—times z—the

elasticity of the non-happiness related component of welfare with respect to earnings.
We can also use the spatial indifference condition and find that happiness is proportional to
𝛼−1

𝛼−1

(𝑧0 ) 𝛼 (𝑤𝑡̂𝑤 + 𝑦0 ) 𝛼 𝑧 , meaning that holding 𝑧0 constant, we should expect to find that richer
places are less happy, and holding income constant, we should expect to find happier places
deficient in some other desirable (non-happiness related) amenity. The unhappiness of declining
cities, therefore, needs to be compensated either with higher real incomes or with some other
asset.
IV.

Are Individuals Compensated for Unhappiness?

In this section, we do not implement the four equation empirical estimation section discussed
above, but rather restrict ourselves to a simpler empirical approach inspired by the theory. We
will test whether individuals in declining, or unhappy, cities are being compensated for their
misery by either lower housing costs or higher wages.
This approach begins with a simple view of America’s changing urban system. We initially built
cities in places where firms had a productive advantage because of proximity to waterways and
coalmines. Moreover, we also built those cities in ways that favored productivity rather than
pleasure. Over time, declining transport costs enabled capital and labor to flee low amenity
places (Glaeser and Kohlhase, 2006) and move to “consumer cities” endowed with higher
amenity levels (Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz, 2001). An increasingly wealthy population also built
new cities that were more oriented towards consumer well-being.
Within the context of the model, this can be understood as a change in the covariance between
productivity and the amenity parameters. In early 20th century America, productivity may have
been higher in lower amenity places but in late 20th century America, that negative covariance
disappeared. As a result, population growth was faster in places that had higher amenities
initially and lower levels of productivity.
This argument provides a slightly different interpretation of the Easterlin (1974) result, at least
insofar as it applies to America’s metropolitan areas. In the early part of the 20th century, a city
needed to be unpleasant to be productive. In the late 20th century, it did not. Since technological
change favored pleasant, happier locales, it seemed as if happiness was tied to income growth,
even if it was ultimately driven by the local environment.
We now turn to the question of compensation. Since no one would presumably have built an
intrinsically unhappy city unless it is more productive, we first look at income levels in 1940.
We test whether the declining cities, which seem also to have been unhappy in the past, paid
29

higher wages in 1940. We also look at housing rents and prices during that year, but housing
quality controls are so weak, we are wary of putting too much weight on those results. We then
turn to 2000 to test whether either wages or rents are compensating the residents of unhappy
declining cities. Finally, we look at whether rents or incomes seem to be directly compensating
for happiness in the 2000 Census.
Census Results for 1940
Table 10 provides our results for 1940. We begin with three regressions for income, in which we
look at total earnings for males aged between 25 and 55. We include a full battery of controls for
age, race and education. The first regression shows that as population growth increases by 0.1
log points, for the cities with population growth below the median, wages drop by 0.014 log
points. Cities that would subsequently decline were very well paid in 1940. We do not mean to
imply causality with this regression. The wages precede the decline and may have caused the
decline. We mean instead to suggest that the residents of cities that declined after 1950, and that
are unhappy today, were relatively well compensated in 1940.
The second regression repeats this exercise controlling for city size today. In this column, we
simply include an indicator variable that takes on a value of one if the population of the
metropolitan area is greater than five million. The coefficient on population is quite large, and it
causes the coefficient on population growth below the median to decline to -0.1. The strong
positive coefficient on large population size is also quite compatible with the compensation
hypothesis, for the Gallup data show that people who live in extremely large cities were
dramatically less happy in the 1940s.
As a third exercise, we also instrument for population growth using climate variables, including
January and July temperatures and precipitation. The coefficient on population decline is largely
unchanged from the second regression. We see this regression as more of a specification check,
but it does seem to support the idea that the declining areas were built in ways and in areas that
were not particularly prone to create happiness, but which were highly productive.
Regressions (4) and (5) in Table 10 provides results for housing prices and rents. In both cases,
the declining cities also have higher housing costs. These higher costs would mean lower real
incomes in these areas which should eat away some of the compensation received for living in
less happy places. However, we are wary of drawing much from these regressions since we are
not really able to control for housing quality in these regressions. As such, the results could just
be showing that the residents of industrial cities in 1940 had substantially better housing than the
residents of the Sunbelt in those years.
Census Results for 2000
Table 11 shows results from the 2000 Census. The first four regressions show results for income
and there is no significant correlation with urban decline. The first specification includes only
30

individual controls; the second specification includes the indicator variable for extremely large
metropolitan areas. The third regression reduces the weight on observations from larger cities in
the regressions, so that the results are not disproportionately dominated by two or three
extremely large metropolitan areas. The fourth regression includes both the indicator dummy
and the weights. All regressions paint a similar picture: declining metropolitan areas are not
particularly well or poorly paid relative to the U.S. as a whole.
The next set of regressions show results for housing values. In this case, the first regression
shows a coefficient of 0.13 which is not distinct from zero. However, this low coefficient
appears to be driven primarily by New York City, which has extremely high housing values and
relatively low growth rates. In the second regression, we control for large population size, which
strongly influences housing values. With this control, we estimate a coefficient of 0.3 on
population growth below the median. This implies that a 0.1 log decrease in population growth
between 1950 and 2000 is associated with housing values that are 0.03 log points lower. The last
two regressions find quite similar coefficient when we include the metropolitan population
weights or include both the weights and the population control.
In the last four regressions of this table, this pattern reappears. With no controls and no
weighting, there is no correlation between decline and weights. With either a large city dummy
or population weights or both, the coefficient becomes significant and the elasticity ranges from
0.2 to 0.3. As such, the residents of declining cities may be less happy, but they are being at
least modestly compensated for lower levels of happiness with lower housing costs.
In Table 12, we look directly at the correlation between happiness, housing rents and area
incomes. We have again controlled for individual attributes, but distinct issues with this
specification remain. If the spatial equilibrium is imperfect, then a temporary shock to local
income should make people happier not unhappy. As such, we may not see the negative
relationship between happiness and real incomes that is predicted by the model.
The happiness variable is not particularly correlated with area income, and the sign changes
across the specifications. 10 One interpretation of this is that while people need higher real
incomes to put up unhappy places, when people have higher real incomes they are happier. The
offset between these two forces creates the near zero coefficients. The second set of regressions
examine housing values, again the results are close to zero although they tend to be weakly
positive.
The last set of results examines the connection between happiness and rental costs. While the
coefficient in regression (9) is negative, the subsequent regressions are strongly positive. Again,
New York is particularly important in these regressions and in driving the negative coefficient in
10

Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008) present GSS data that also show a low correlation between happiness and income in
the cross-section of cities.

31

the first regression. It is a large city with high rents and low self-reported happiness. When we
control for being in a big city, or if we reduce the weight on observations for particularly large
cities, the coefficient on the happiness measure ranges from 0.53 to 0.66. A 0.1 standard
deviation increase in area level happiness is associated with a 0.06 log point increase in area
rents.
This relationship is shown in Figure 7 which collapses the data to the metropolitan area level, but
excludes California (which has much higher rents). The positive relationship is generally
visible, but a small number of cities with higher rents and lower levels of self-reported happiness
can be seen in the upper left hand corner of the graph. These are the large metropolitan areas of
the east coast, such as New York and Boston. These places also tend to pay high wages, which
is presumably how their residents are being compensated for lower levels of happiness.
In sum, this Table suggests that higher wages compensated for the unhappiness of cities that
were large and productive in the 1940s, but would subsequently decline. The population decline
has not offset the unhappiness, but is associated with lower housing costs that could partly
compensate for the lower reported well-being in such places. This tradeoff is consistent with a
model in which happiness is one argument in utility, but harder to reconcile with views that
emphasize happiness as equivalent to utility, or as individuals’ ultimate objective.

V.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have documented significant differences in self-reported well-being across
American cities that persist, even when we control for endogenous and exogenous demographics
and even when we control for individual fixed effects. These facts are not reliably correlated
with many area level attributes, but they do seem to be connected with urban decline across at
least three large data sets. We do not interpret this correlation as suggesting that population
decline causes unhappiness. Indeed, cities that have declined also seem to have been unhappy in
the past, which suggests that a better interpretation might be that these areas were always
unhappy—and that was one reason why they declined.
Differences in happiness and subjective well-being across space weakly support the view that the
desires for happiness and life satisfaction do not uniquely drive human ambitions. If we choose
only that which maximized our happiness, then individuals would presumably move to happier
places until the point where rising rents and congestion eliminated the joys of that locale. An
alternative view is that humans are quite understandably willing to sacrifice both happiness and
life satisfaction if the price is right. This viewpoint rationalizes the well-known tendency of
parents to report lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Indeed, the residents of
unhappier metropolitan areas today do receive higher real wages—presumably as compensation
for their misery.

32

Declining cities seem also to have been unhappy during the past, but in 1940, the cities that were
prone to future decline earned outsized incomes, both nominal and real. The industrial cities of
the Midwest may have reported lower happiness levels, but their residents were getting richer as
a result. As transportation cost declines freed industry from the Great Lakes and the Coal Mines,
we shouldn’t be surprised that people left less pleasant locations. Today, the residents of cities
that declined aren’t receiving higher nominal wages, but they do seem to be paying lower rents.
As such, the unhappiness of America’s declining cities may have been compensated with higher
incomes in the past and lower housing costs today.

Data Appendix
BRFSS
Throughout this paper, we follow the literature in measure happiness using self-reported survey
data on subjective well-being (SWB). We use a large national survey, the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), which asks individuals to report on their own life satisfaction using a discrete
response scale.
The CDC (2005-2010) has conducted BRFSS surveys annually since 1985, in order to study risk
factors for various diseases. This is a large, nationally-representative survey, involving more
than 350,000 respondents in over two thousand counties annually.
The BRFSS survey is administered by individual states via telephone interviews. The interviews
are collected via computer-assisted phone calls to randomly selected landlines. 11 During our
sample period of 2005 to 2009, the survey covers all 50 states and Washington, DC. 12
Individuals report their county to the interviewer, and we drop observations where county is not
reported.
Based on the self-reported county, respondents live in 367 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)
and non-metropolitan regions. 13 When we examine temporal patterns in the data, we restrict the
sample to the 177 MSAs with at least 200 respondents in each year.
The life satisfaction question we use has been a part of the BRFSS “core” since 2005. Core
questions are asked in every interview with minor exceptions. In 2009, the life satisfaction
question was not asked in less than 5% of BRFSS surveys, which is approximately the same
percent unasked of similar questions in the survey. This number is slightly lower in other years.
Responses to LSATISFY of “refused” and “unsure” are treated as missing responses and
dropped from the dataset.
One might be concerned that individual SWB is reported on a discrete scale, with values whose
interpretation is not obvious. When we summarize one area’s happiness as a linear average of
these discrete values, the resulting summary is undoubtedly a noisy and imperfect measure arealevel happiness. We cannot solve this problem, but Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) find that more
11

CDC provides weights to adjust for differences in phone line density across areas, but we do not use these
weights.
12
Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are also included, but we drop the three territories.
13
We use the county FIPS code to assign the respondent to a metropolitan area. We use the Office of Management
and Budget’s definitions of metropolitan areas from 1999 (which correspond to data from the 2000 Census). We use
Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) rather than Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs),
where applicable. We classify respondents in New England, according to their New England Consolidated
Metropolitan Statistical Area (NECMA) rather than PMSA or CMSA. We classify all respondents not living in an
MSA, PMSA, or NECMA as part of one “non-metropolitan region” for their state (e.g., “non-metropolitan Texas”).

56

sophisticated methods yield results that are extremely highly correlated across countries
(correlations are regularly above 0.99) with results from this method.
We standardize each year’s data separately, with respect to the overall mean and standard
deviation for the survey year in question.
One wave of the BRFSS may actually be administered in two different years (e.g., the 2009
wave interview respondents from January 2009 through January 2010). The year fixed effects
𝛾𝑡 that we estimate represent the survey wave as opposed to the actual year of the interview.

The concern about systematic differences in individual SWB is not merely hypothetical. On the
contrary, a large body of research has documented regular patterns based on age, sex, income,
life events, and other demographic characteristics. 14 To the extent that people sort across areas
based on these same characteristics, this will bias our estimates of area-level happiness.
A small percentage of survey respondents refuse to respond to one or more of the demographic
questions asked. The total fraction refusing to answer, unsure of, or not being asked at least one
demographic question of interest is about 2.3% in any year. We drop any observation with any
such missing demographic information, as well as respondents over 85 years old.
The controls for children’s characteristics deserve further elaboration. While the survey nearly
always has information about the number of children in the household, more detailed information
is available for only one randomly selected child. In most states during most years, the BRFSS
asks about the age of one randomly selected child in the household, as well as the respondent’s
relationship to that child. 15 We therefore create indicator variables for four age ranges of the
randomly selected child, and six categories for the respondent’s relationship. 16 The omitted
group for these questions is respondents with no children. We add a separate dummy variable
indicating respondents with children in state-years when no question was asked about a child’s
age.
Appendix Table 1 reports the coefficients on the controls in this regression, when run on our full
sample of 1,574,361 respondents across five waves of BRFSS. For the most part, these
coefficients are consistent with findings in the previous literature, and robust to the inclusion or
exclusion of area fixed effects. In column 1, we include only the basic demographic controls
discussed above. We find that age has an important influence on subjective well-being, as
estimated by a fifth-order polynomial in age. On average men are 0.036 standard deviations less

14

e.g. Sacks, Stevenson, and Wolfers (2010)
The survey is divided into core questions and modules, the latter of which each state individually elects whether to
ask in their phone interviews. Individual states sometimes add additional questions on their own. None of the
questions we focus on are module or state questions in any year, except for the age of one randomly selected child.
16
In the 2006 survey, the age of the child is not recorded, but is imputed from the reported birthdate. In 2007, the
age is recorded in the BRFSS in months, and we round this down to an integer number of years.
15

57

happy than women. There are strongly significant differences across races, with whites reporting
the highest average well-being.
The most significant correlates of happiness in column 1 are education level and marital status.
Education has one of the largest impacts on individual responses, with a range of nearly half a
standard deviation from high school dropouts to college graduates. But bear in mind that this
regression does not control for individual-level income, which may mediate this relationship
somewhat. Marital status is also extremely important, with married individuals half a standard
deviation happier than single or divorced respondents. Those reporting being separated are onesixth of a standard deviation less happy than singles or divorcees.
Our estimates of the relationship between happiness and the presence of children in the
household differ from previous findings. The existing literature has generally found a significant
negative association between happiness and having children, especially young children. 17 In the
BRFSS data, however, there seems to be a more complex relationship. This regression allows us
to compute the connection between a respondent’s subjective well-being and the presence of
children with various characteristics in the household. To calculate the complete relationship,
we need to add the coefficients for the appropriate number of children (one, two, three or more),
the age of the randomly selected child (one of four categories, or unknown), and the respondent’s
relationship to the randomly selected child. For all of these characteristics, the coefficients
presented in Appendix Table 1 are expressed relative to the omitted group of respondents with
no children in the household.
Parents in a one-child household are, on average, anywhere from 0.01 standard deviations less
happy than similar respondents with no child to 0.07 standard deviations happier, depending on
the child’s age. Older children appear to be associated with less happiness, all else equal, with
11-17-year-olds having a coefficient 0.076 standard deviations below 0-1-year-olds. We find
increasingly positive coefficients as the number of children increases, with a bump of 0.04
standard deviations for a second child and a further 0.01 standard deviation gain with a third
child or beyond.
These benign or positive relationships between children and happiness disappear if the
respondent is the child’s guardian but not the biological parent. Grandparents, foster parents,
and unspecified other relatives have very strong negative coefficients, which wipe out the
(otherwise positive) associations with most categories of number and age of children. In other
17

The negative relationship between children—especially young children—and parents’ happiness is widely
accepted in the literature. Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald (2001) report increasingly negative coefficients on life
satisfaction in the EuroBarometer as the number of children increases (table A1). This finding dates back at least to
Glenn and Weaver (1979), who find the negative coefficient to be largest for children under 5 years old in the
General Social Survey (Table 1). The closest finding to ours is Clark and Oswald (1994), who estimate a negative
effect of having one child relative to no children, and insignificant negative effects of having two or more children
compared with none (Tables 2 and 3). They do not report results controlling for children’s ages.

58

specifications (not reported), we interact the number or age of children with the respondent’s
marital status or relationship with the random child. These regressions tend to confirm that the
positive correlation between children and respondents’ well-being is concentrated among
married couples and respondents who are the child's biological parents, while the other groups
tend to have negative associations between the presence of children and their own well being.
Even without these interactions, our data suggest a more complex relationship than that
previously found between subjective well-being and the presence and age of children. These
correlations are sensitive to the relationship between the children present and the individual in
question. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the inclusion of controls for relationship with the child
fully explains the difference between our results and the negative coefficients on children’s
presence reported in other papers. The cases of non-parental relationship status are probably not
sufficiently prevalent to explain the aggregate negative associations found in other datasets.
Subsequent regressions in Appendix Table 1 add controls for the respondent’s economic
situation. In column 2, we add dummies for labor force status. With employed individuals as
the omitted group, we find that self-employment is associated with a 0.036 standard deviations
more well-being, while the unemployed are 0.44 to 0.57 standard deviations less happy than
employed workers. Retirees are 0.02 standard deviations less happy than workers, controlling
for age, and those unable to work are 0.7 standard deviations less happy than workers. Including
labor force status controls has only a modest impact on the coefficients on other demographics,
with the notable exception of the indicator for being black. This dummy reverses signs, from 0.025 in column 1 to 0.01 in column 2.
Column 3 adds controls for reported income categories, in addition to of the previous
characteristics. These dummies show that happiness increases monotonically in income, with a
range of 0.6 from the omitted category (less than $10,000 per year) to the highest-income
category (above $75,000 per year). Because income is correlated with many of the other
covariates, its inclusion dramatically shifts some of the coefficients on other variables, including
education, unemployment, race and marital status, relative to their levels in column 2.

Aggregate Data
Our aggregate data about the metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in the country come from
various sources. These data mostly come from the National Historical Geographic Information
System (Minnesota Population Center, 2004), which compiles data from the U.S. Census. We
obtain these data at the county level and consolidate them using the same metropolitan area
definitions from 1999 as we use for the BRFSS. We obtain a number of quality of life
measurements from Albouy (2008), and geographic data from Rappaport and Sachs (2003).

59

Data on Movers from the National Survey of Families and Households
To examine the relationship between changes in subjective well-being and changes in geographic
location, we need to match the longitudinal NSFH data to geographic data. Because the
geographic locations of survey respondents are considered confidential, we can’t link individual
responses to the names of the counties or PMSAs in which those individuals reside. However,
the NSFH provided us with a match between survey respondent case IDs and certain geographic
characteristics (“geomerge”). 18 For each wave, for each publically available observation, the
NSFH provided a corresponding dataset with the observation case ID number and the
characteristics of the respondent’s county and PMSA. While we can’t link individual
respondents to named geographic locations, we can link individuals with the relevant
characteristics of their counties and PMSAs in each wave. Included in our match are census data
on county and PMSA population, education, and income, other geographic amenities like crime
statistics and temperature, and the county and PMSA fixed effects on subjective well-being that
we estimated previously using the BRFSS.
With the geographic characteristics from both NSFH waves, we are able to isolate the population
of NSFH respondents who moved counties or PMSAs. In NSFH2, 2,395 respondents report
moving cities since NSFH1. Using our matched dataset, we find 1,939 respondents who both
answered the question on subjective well-being and have different county characteristics for
NSFH1 and NSFH2, denoting a change in the respondent’s county of residence. Of that group,
we similarly find 1,480 respondents to have moved to a new PMSA.
Our analysis focuses on the relationship between the changes in reported subjective well-being
of this population and the changes in the respondents’ county and PMSA characteristics. We run
regressions of the form
(5)

Δ𝑦𝑖 = 𝜏 + 𝜓Δ𝑢�𝑖 + 𝜑Δ𝑋𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖

across individuals who move. The coefficient 𝜓 identifies the relationship between changes in
area-level happiness and changes in individual happiness, possibly controlling for changes in
other covariates (at the area or individual level) between the two observations, captured in Δ𝑋𝑖 .

We are extremely grateful to Larry Bumpass, Jack Solock, Charles Fiss, and the Center for Demography of Health
and Aging University of Wisconsin-Madison for generously conducting this geomerge for us and providing us with
the data. The use of these geographically merged, but not individually identified data was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Historical Gallup Polls
Gallup polls in the 1940s asked:
“In general, how happy would you say you are – very happy, fairly happy, not very
happy, not at all happy?”
We recoded answers as a dummy variable equal to 1 for “very happy” and “fairly happy”
responses and 0 for “not very happy” or “not at all happy.” The distribution of raw answers is as
follows:
Very happy
Fairly happy
Not very happy
Not at all happy
