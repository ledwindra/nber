Social Security Benefits:
An Empirical Study of Expectations and Realizations

ABSTRACT

I employ data drawn
the

from the

Retirement History Survey to study

accuracy of pre—retirement expectations concerning social security

benefits. The major findings of this study are as follows. First,

survey responses to questions about expected benefits are reasonably
noisy. However, when one properly filters out the noise, reported

forecasts

appear to explain roughly 60% of the variance in realizations.
Second, consumers do not form expectations on the basis of all available
information. Proper adjustment of forecasts for information contained

in concurrent social security entitlements could reduce the residual
forecast error variance by roughly 15%. The potential gains from
incorporating other information are minimal. Third, individuals do not
ignore or forget information which they have used in the past, and they
tend to form all expectations on the basis of the same information.

Fourth, expectations are highly accurate, given the information that
people do use. Extreme optimism Is uncommon. Surprisingly, expectations were not abnormally inaccurate during periods of rapid legislative
change. Fifth, of various population subgroups, widows and single women
tend to make both the most conservative and most accurate forecasts.
Married men are least conservative and least accurate. Accuracy and
conservativism are not systematically related to wealth or education.
Finally, individual behavior appears to conform more closely to the
predictions of theory as retirement approaches.

Introduction
Expectations play a key role in modern life cycle theory. This is

something of an embarrassment to applied economists, since perceptions

are not, in general, directly observable. Little if any existing
evidence sheds light on the plausibility of central life cycle tennets,

which hold that
relatively

consumers

think seriously and coherently about the

distant and uncertain future. The extent to which financial

hardship among the elderly stems from myopia and inept financial

planning therefore remains largely a matter of speculation. In
addition, economists are frequently forced to invoke a variety of strong
assumptions concerning the structure of expectations in order to
identify behavioral models (e.g. many studies are based on the
supposition that consumers understand the Social

An

example of this appears in the literature on Social Secrity

and personal saving: when employing macroeconomic data, one can obtain

virtually any desired result by altering assumptions concerning
expectations (see Leimer and L.esnoy's [1981] criticism of Feldatein
[1974]).

The

study of expectations is therefore absolutely central to a

comprehensive understanding of life cycle behavior.
Previous

empirical work on household expectations has focused

primarily on inflation (see Huizinga [1980], Curtain [1982], Gramlich
[1983], and Papadia [19821; Aiginger 11981] considers a somewhat broader

range of variables). To my knowledge, there has

appropriately, it appears that consumers do think seriously about future
events, and report expectations which may well reflect, albeit

imperfectly, their true beliefs. Indeed, respondentst forecasts explain
roughly 60% of the variance in realizations.

The evidence is broadly consistent with the view that

individuals use the same information to form expectations concerning a
variety of different variables (social security benefits, other income,

and date of retirement). When forming expectations concerning social
security,

individuals do not appear to ignore

information upon which

they base other expectations at the same point in time. In addition,
consumers have good memories, in that they do not ignore information
upon which they based expectations at previous points in time.

People seem to be reasonably competent at forming relatively

accurate expectations conditional upon the information that they do

chose to use. In addition, it is somewhat comforting to note that few
individuals exhibit the kind of extreme optimism that might be
responsible for catastrophic errors in financial planning; indeed, there

is a general bias towards conservativism. Surprisingly, there is very
little evidence to support the

view that expectations were abnormally

inaccurate during periods of significant statutory reform. Indeed, the
data broadly suggest that consumers correctly anticipated the general
effects of legislative action during the early 70's, contrary to the
supposition of most previous authors (see e.g. Hurd and Boskin

Data on retirement expectations bear this conclusion out

(see Bernheim [198Th]).

accurate expectations.

2.

A Conceptual Framework

It is plainly unreasonable to expect that an elderly person could
predict without error his financial resources several years hence.

Uncertainty is simply a fact of life. For purposes of conducting
behavioral analyses and designing public policy, the relevant issue is
whether individuals have learned to deal with this uncertainty as well

as their circumstances allow. Economists frequently employ the
assumption that households form their expectations "rationally," in the
sense that they are not fooled systematically, and furthermore, that
their forecasts are as precise as possible conditional upon available

information. Given data on expectations, one can test this hypothesis
in a variety of ways. One approach is to determine whether or not
forecast errors are systematically related to information which the
individual possesses (or has access to) at the time his forecast is

made. If they are, then one can actually identify the kind of
information which individuals either ignore, or use improperly. Another
approach is to examine the accuracy of predictions, and to see whether

they become more accurate as knowledge improves. In this section, I
develop these ideas formally.

Suppose that at each point in time, t =

0,1,...,

T — 1, an

individual forms an expectation, X, about the value of same variable

X, which is realized at time T. During period t, he has access to
certain information, which I denote as

Throughout, I assume that

the individual's memory is perfect, so that all information available at

time t is also available in period v > t.

—6—

In subsequent sections, I interpret X as social security

benefits, and T as date of retirement.iJ When an individual reports
expected social security benefits, there is, of course, some ambiguity

as to what this means. While he may have in mind something like a
mathematical expectation, it is also possible that his report reflects

his view of the most likely outcome (i.e., the mode). As long as the

distribution of X is approximately symmetric and single—peaked, this
ambiguity is probably of very little consequence. Throughout, I
therefore focus on the hypothesis that individuals report expected
values, i.e.

x =

(1)

E(X)

From equation (1), one can derive a number of simple testable
implications, which I summarize below as properties I through 4.

Property 1: Realizations should exhibit more variability than
forecasts.

Property 2: The variability of forecasts should increase as the
date of realization approaches.

Property 3: The variance of the forecast error should decline as
the date of realization approaches.

Property 4: The correlation between forecasts and realizations
should rise as the date of realization approaches.

—7—

The intuition for these results is straightforward. Different
individuals should make different forecasts only if their information

differs. Thus, as individuals acquire more differentiated information,
forecasts should become more heterogeneous. Since Information improves

over time, property 2 follows naturally. Note

to determine

whether or not consumers efficiently process available information. If
these tests should fail, further Investigation would be warranted. In
particular, one would want to identify the kinds of information that

individuals tend to ignore or process incorrectly. It is possible to
shed some light on this issue by adopting a somewhat different

approach. Specifically, equation (1) suggests the following regression

The data for this study are drawn from the Social Security

Administration's Retirement History Survey (RHS), which

followed

a

sample of retirement—aged households (58 to 63 years old in 1969) for a

period of 10 years, beginning in 1969. Wach household was surveyed once
every two

years

(1969, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977, and 1979). Although the

initial wave included more than 11,000 households, there was substantial
attrition over successive waves.
In 1969, 1971, and 1973, respondents reported the level of social
security benefits that

they

expected to receive upon retirement. In

subsequent sections, the variable ESS (expected social security)

reflects answers to these questions, adjusted to an annual basis.
Unfortunately, data on expected benefits were extremely poor in 1969.
Casual inspection revealed a low resonse rate (due in part to survey

skip patterns), as well as a high frequency of nonsensical values. I
have therefore confined attention to responses given in 1971 and 1973.

Unfortunately, interpretation of expected benefits is somewhat
problematic, in that

the

treatment of inflation is ambiguous.

—9.-

Certainly, the survey instrument does not specify whether the individual

is to report a real or nominal figure. Throughout, I simply assume that
respondents report expected benefits in current (i.e. survey year)

dollars. This seems the most natural choice, since respondents would
otherwise have had

to

forecast future inflation rates

before

formulating

an answer to the question. To the extent my assumption is incorrect,
the scale of expectations may be somewhat off.

The primary advantage of the RHS is that it allows the analyst to
identify realizations by employing data from subsequent survey waves.

In the case of social security benefits, this process is somewhat

Since most of this undoubtably reflects "noise", the use of such

data would introduce spurious forecast error. I therefore opt to use
calculated values instead. The calculation procedes in several steps.
First, I Identify the year in which each repondent began to
receive social security benefits. While it is safe to assume that
individuals rarely report the receipt of benefits when they in fact
receive none, failure to report positive benefits does not necessarily

security income, and the respondent's reported date of retirement.

Unfortunately, respondents are never asked to report their dates of

retirement directly. Instead, they indicate whether or not they are
retired at two year intervals. I take the respondent's reported date of
retirement to be the date at which he left his last job prior to first

classifying himself as retired. When the respondent fails to report
this date, I take it to be midway between successive survey years (i.e.

in the year prior to the survey year when he first reports himself as
retired).

Second, I calculate yearly social security income for each

individual by compiling his earnings history, and applying the benefit
formula in effect during the year when he first began

receiving

benefits. Fortunately, the social security administration has provided
matching administrative records on official earnings histories through
1975——the SSA uses these same data to calculate henef its In practice.
These records are,

of

course, incomplete for individuals who began to

receive benefits after 1975. In these cases, I use survey data on
reported earnings after 1975 to complete the records. While survey data
are available only through 1979,

this

turned out to be immaterial——

according to the criterion described above, no Individual who reports an
expected benefit in either 1971 or 1973 actually began to receive social
security benefits after 1979.

As described in section 2, part of my objective is to relate
forecast errors to available information, in order to identify the kinds
of information that individuals either Ignore or process incorrectly.

—11—

consider two dozen informational variables, which I group into three
distinct categories.

The first category contains variables which measure other reported

expectations. The inclusion of these variables allows me to determine
whether or not individuals have internally consistent expectations, in
the sense that they base all expectations on the same set of

information. By including lagged expectations, I can test the
hypothesis that individuals have good memories, in the sense that they

ignore information which they employed at some prior point in

never

time. Definitions of specific variables follow.

security benefits do not, for example, report an

retirement. Accordingly, I also use dummy variables,

the individual reports the associated expectation, and

I refer to the dummies corresponding to the five

expectational variables listed above as DRET, DOl, LDSS, LDRET, and
LDOI, respectively.

—12—

The second category includes a single variable, which is the
individual's current social security entitlement, CSS, defined as the
level of benefits he would receive under current law if he retired

immediately. CSS is, theoretically, part of each individual's
information set, in that

it depends only upon his own past earnings

history, and upon current law (which is public information). i3y
including CSS, it is possible to determine the extent to which
individuals ignore information related to existing statutes.

The third and final category includes various demographic

variables

and other household characteristics which might be useful in

predicting future social security benefits. The list of variables
includes:

MAR:

a dummy variable, indicating whether or not the respondent
is married (1 =

DIV:

is divorced (1 =

the respondent's level of educational attainment (measured
in number of years).

be uncorrelated with the forecast error——dropping these observations

should not bias the regression results. The fourth item (subsequent

attrition)

does reflect events occurring after the forecast was made,

—14—

and therefore may well be correlated with the forecast error.

Nevertheless, this seems relatively unlikely. Attrition occurs
primarily because of death, or because the respondent has moved. Death
is, of course, highly correlated with realized social security benefits,

in the trivial sense that an individual who dies prior to retirement

receives nothing. However, I strongly suspect that individuals report a
conditional (upon survival) expectation (i.e. the respondent thinks, if

I live until retirement, what will I get?) If so, no sample selection
bias arises. When attrition occurs for other reasons, one cannot make
the same argument. However, the RHS did successfully locate many
respondents after they had moved. Consequently, the variable MOVE
should give some indication as to whether the resulting sample selection

bias is significant. As we shall see, the evidence suggests that it is
not.

The second problem concerns the non—independence of realizations.
In a short panel such as the RHS, forecast errors are probably

correlated accross observations, due to "macro" events. Suppose, for
example, that subsquent to the date at which forecasts are recorded,

Congress unexpectedly raises social security benefits by 20%. Then one
would presumably discover that, on average, forecast errors are

significantly positive. One should not construe this as contradictory
to theory, since forecasts may indeed be unbiased given the ex ante
distribution of macro events.

Since the 1970's witnessed several large and potentially
unexpected real increases in social security benefits, this problem is

—15—

potentially

severe. I am particularly concerned about the 20% increase

in benefits enacted in September 1972, and the double indexing for
inflation which caused real benefit levels to rise substantially between

1975 and 1977. However, these were, for the most part, across—the—board
increases in benefit levels. As a result, they probably affected little
more than scale. To put it another way, one would not be surprised to
find

> 1 in estimates of equation (2), and one should not construe

this as contrary to theory. Indeed, through estimates of , one can
hope to discern the extent to which these legislative changes were

actually anticipated. However, one wOuld still expect to find cx = y = 0
under the hypothesis that the theory is accurate.

This last remark is somewhat debatable. Legislative changes
during the 70's did alter individuals' budget constraints (see Hurd and

Boskin 119811 for an example). Presumably, this had behavioral

consequences. To the extent different types

of

individuals had

systematically different behavioral response to changes in their budget

constraints, then the corresponding characteristics would, ex post, be

correlated with forecast errors, even if the theory was valid. In the
absence of more extensive longitudinal data, little can be done about
this problem. The reader should bear this qualification in mind when
evaluating

and the mean square forecast error.

Consider first the response rates

to

questions about expected

benefits. Since respondents may fail to report expectations for a
variety of reasons, one should not attach too much importance to any

particular rate. However, since the quality of an individual's
information almost certainly affects the likelihood that he will report

an expectation, relative response rates may be informative. The overall rate was 42% in 1971, and 40% in 1973. Since the average individual
is closer to his date of realization in 1973 than in 1971, this is
somewhat surprising——one would expect information to improve, and hence
reporting to rise, as individuals approach retirement.

A comparison of response rate across population subgroups reveals
that in 1971, single women and widows were least likely to report

expected benefits. Yet in 1973, these subgroups were among the most

A further point about the overall average forecast error deserves

mention. In conducting regression analysis (see sections 5 and 6), I
also calculated averages for several other variables, including current

social security entitlement (css). Astonishingly, in 1973 the mean
value of expected social security benefits differed from the mean value

of current social security entitlement by only 4Oc. While this may be
largely coincidence, it also raises the possibility that, once
individuals have reached retirement age (recall that respondents are
between 62 and 67 years old in 1973),

they

form expectations by

observing the experiences of similarly situated acquaintances who,
unlike the respondent, choose to retire and receive their current
entitlements.

Differences

between subgroups are apparent. In 1971, married men

had the smallest relative mean forecast error. Widows and single women
were, on average, furthest off——their expectations tended to be very
conservative. In 1973, widows and single women were still among the
most conservative, but were joined by married men. The average forecast
for single men was almost right on the nose. Once again, there appears
to be no clear relationship with either education or wealth; if

anything, the

—19—

although married men improved their performance relative to other groups
(note that the correlations were generally lower in 1973——more on this

later). Mean squared errors (the final collumn of Tables 2 and 3) also
suggest that, despite their conservatism, women tend to make the most
accurate forecasts, and that married men tend to make the least accurate
forecasts.

I can only speculate as to the causes of this pattern. Unmarried
women (especially widows) nay depend more heavily upon social security

benefits

than other groups, and may therefore have more of a stake in

acquiring accurate

greater
access to other resources, and nay therefore spend less time thinking
information.

In contrast, couples may

4. I will take them in order.

The data for 1971 are superficially consistent with property I

However, there are

two reasons

to

question

evidence. First, as mentioned above, the average realization

—20—

exceeds

the average expectation by 10. Assuming that this is

attributable to some macro event that increased benefits proportionally
across the boards, one should adjust for scale by inflating the standard
deviation of expectations by 109, in which case the data appear

inconsistent with property 1. Second, the rather small

differences

between the standard errors of expectations and realizations suggest
that relatively little new information becomes available between 1971

and retirement. The opposite conclusion is suggested by the rather low
correlations between expectations and realizations. Note finally that
the data for 1973

directly

contradict property 1.

While the evidence seems contradictory to theory, strong

inferences may be premature. In view of the fact that actual income is
reported with a high level of noise (see section 3), it seems likely

that expectations are also measured with error. In particular,
respondents may report "ballpark figures" in surveys, despite using a

more precise forecast for planning purposes. Measurement error could
easily account for the apparent failure of property 1. I will return to
this issue in section 6.

data from 1971 and 1973 reveals precisely the opposite pattern. The
mean squared errors rise for every subgroup, and the correlation

coefficient falls for 5 of 7 groups. This suggests either that
individuals process information incorrectly, or, contrary to my
assertion in the preceding paragraph, they ignore information which they
have employed at previous points in time.

Tables 3 and 4

provide

a more disaggregated tabulation of the data

for married men (other subgroups simply did not contain enough

observations to permit similar calculations). In particular, I report
the same set of items broken down by date of expected retirement. Since
retirement Is for the moat part equivalent to realization of social
security benefits, this disaggregation facilitates a more explicit
analysis of properties 2 through 4.

I use expected date of retirement

rather than the actual date because the actual date is presumably
correlated with information that became available subsequent to the
survey year, and which therefore may well be correlated with forecast
error.

Note first that, in 1971, the fraction of individuals reporting an
expectation declines monotonically with the expected date of retirement.
The same pattern holds in 1973, expect for one aberration (I.e. those

expecting to retire In 1974 had an unsually low response rate). This
finding contrasts with the longitudinal result noted above, that

response rates were lower in 1973.

The relative mean

forecast

errors in Tables 3 and 4 merit

particularly close scruitiny. Consider first the results for 1971.
Recall that legislative action raised benefit levels by about 20% in
September of 1972, and that most analysts have thought of this as an

unanticipated change. I have already suggested that the overall mean
forecast error Is at least partially consistent with this view.

However, the disaggregated results are

not.

Note that respondents who

expected to retire in 1971, prior to the benefit increase, had the

largest mean forecast error, in most cases by a wide margin. Those
expecting to retire in 1972, 1973, and 1974, after the benefit increase,
had much smaller mean forecast errors, and the magnitudes of these

errors fell well short of the real benefit increase. Forecast errors
were somewhat larger for those intending to retire after 1974, but
smallest of all for those who planned to continue working indefinitely.

A qualitatively similar pattern

However, the magnitude of this error declined monotically with the date

of expected retirement thereafter. Indeed, the mean forecast error was
relatively low for those expecting to retire after 1975, despite the
fact that 1975 through 1977 was the period of double indexing.

One

might object that expected dates of retirement nay differ

substantially
expecting

from actual realizations. If, for

example, those

to retire in 1971 actually worked on average for several more

years, one would not necessarily expect this group to exhibit a

—23—

lower mean forecast error, even if the 1972 legislation

systematically

was unanticipated. In practice, the correspondence between expected and
actual dates

of

retirement is quite close. Analysis of the data reveals

that the expected date of retirement was always the modal realization.

More specifically, in 1971 approximately 40% of those who expected to
retire in the current year actually did so, while in contrast only 10%
of those expecting to retire in 1972 actually retired in 1971 (see
Bernheim [1987bJ

for

more details). Accordingly, under the view that

the 1972 legislation was indeed unanticipated, one would be hard pressed
to account for the apparent differences between subgroups.

Overall, the evidence contradicts the hypothesis that the overall
mean forecast errors in 1971 and 1973 were attributable to unanticipated

reforms. Individuals do not appear to form systematically less accurate
forecasts during periods of legislative change.

Consider

next the pattern of standard deviations on reported

expectations. Property 2 suggests that these should rise as individuals
age. The evidence from Tables 3 and 4 is mixed—-the standard deviation
does

not

move monotonically with expected date of retirement. This

contrasts

with the rather strong evidence in favor of proposition 2

arising from a pure longitudinal comparison (see above).
Turn finally to correlations and mean

—24—

These results are supportive of properties 3 and 4. The general pattern
is basically the same, although perhaps somewhat weaker in 1973.

Tables

3 and 4 also jointly facilitate more refined longitudinal

comparisons. For those who expected to retire in any given year (e.g.
1974), i) the standard error of forecasts rises between 1971

ii)

and

1973,

with only one exception, the mean squared forecast error rises, and

iii) the correlation between forecasts and realizations rises for some

groups, and falls for others. The

first observation

is consistent with

property 2; the second is inconsistent with property 3; and the third is

weakly inconsistent with property 4. Thus, disaggregation does not
alter the apparent implications of longitudinal comparisons.

One finalobservation of interest is that the relationship between
expected and realized social security benefits for those who fail to
report an expected date of retirement seems very similar to the

relationship for those who do report such a date. I find this result
somewhat surprising, in that an accurate forecast of one's retirement
date seems essential when one is formulating an expectation about future
social security benefits.

approximately one in six individuals believes that benefits will exceed
their actual levels by more than 25%; approximately one in twelve

individuals expects over 50 more than they receive; and 29—3% of all
individuals receive less than half of what they expected. Widows,
widowers, and single women are the most conservative groups, although

men are not far behind. Married men are the least conservative,

Regression Analysis
tn this section I present estimates of equation (2) based upon the

data and variables described in section 3. I provide separate

results

for 1971 and 1973. The 1971 sample contained 1949 observations, while
the 1973 sample included 942 observations.
I will begin with tests

of

the comparatively weak hypothesis that

individuals form unbiased (conditional upon whatever information they do

use), although possibly inefficient expectations. That is, I estimate

informational variables have statistically

other income (EoI), current social security entitlement (CSS), age (AGE

(KIDS), and compulsory retirement (COMPRET). Marital status (MAR, Dlv,
WID) does not appear to matter, nor does mobility (MOVE).

Wealth (w)

In 1973, fewer informational variables have statistically

marginally

significant coefficients. As before, CSS plays an important explanatory
role. Note that the 1973 regressions also include lagged expectations

(this

was not possible in 1971 due to data quality). LESS, the lagged

value of social security benefits, appears with a very significant
coefficient, which suggests that individuals nay have poor memories.
Aside from CSS and LESS, only ED enters significantly.

These results strongly contradict the theory of expectations

outlined in section 2. Unfortunately, interpretation of the
coefficients is problemmatic. Since the coefficient of ESS is in
general rather small, other variables are probably explaining the
magnitude of actual benefits, rather than the forecast error.

It would, however, be premature to reject the theory on the basis

of

this evidence alone. As mentioned in section 4, there is some

indication that

reported

expectations are rather noisy. Measurement

error could account for the positive intercept and small

slope

coefficient. Other informational variables (especially CSS and LESS)
might then help to filter out the noise, in which case they would appear

with spuriously significant coefficients. These observations motivate
the analysis of section 6.

each of these approaches. The section closes with an analysis of "true"

forecast errors.

and various individual characteristics, for 1971 and 1973,

respectively. In both equations, CSS still enters significantly (in
fact, ESS and CSS roughly divide up the original coefficient on ESS),

although, as expected, the coefficient of CSS is lower than in section

5. This result confirms the view that individuals ignore information
embodied in current statutes. In 1971, AGE, SAGE, ED, SED, W, and PH

all enter significantly, while MAR is nrginal. The direction of each
effect is essentially the same as in section 6A. In 1973, nothing
besides ESS and CSS is statistically significant (AGE and W come

closest). Once again, it appears as though individuals used information
better in 1973, when they were closer to retirement, than in 1971.

As mentioned at the outset of this subsection, there are a variety

of candidates for instrumental variables. The alternative employed
above is not only intuitively appealing, but also yields results that

are highly consistent with the basic theory. However, I have also
estimated equation (2) with other instruments. One set of estimates
tested the basic expectations hypothesis jointly with the assumption
that respondents

make proper use of available data

on

demographic

characteristics when formulating expectations (i.e., I used variables in
the third category as Instruments). Once again, the results supported
the view that, after a small scale adjustment, reported expectations are
unbiased estimates of realizations, conditional upon demographic

variables and whatever other information individuals actually use. The

Fortunately, it is possible to recover the variance of the true
forecast errors through IV estimates, such as those presented in section
613.

I provide a detailed description of the procedure in appendix 13.

In essence, one recovers the variance of the measurement error by
comparing OLS estimates from a regression of SSI on ESS with IV

estimates. One then computes the variance of the true forecast error as
a residual from the variance of the IV regression error. One can also
use this procedure to assess the net reduction in true forecast error
that would result from incorporating new information into the forecast.

To emphasize the importance of correcting for measurement error, I
begin by presenting the unadjusted variances of regression errors

(Table 9). The first row of Table 9 simply provides, as a basis for
comparison, the population variance of realized social security income

naming the population mean——a finding that is clearly at odds with the
hypothesis that individuals use information rationally. While a
significant improvement results from augmenting the information

contained in ESS with CSS (current entitlements), the proper use of
demographic information seems, on the whole, more important.

When we adjust the numbers in Table 9 for the presence of
measurement error in order to obtain the variance of true forecast

error, a dramatically different picture emerges (see Table 10). Private
forecasts for 1971 now explain 56% of the variance in realized benefits;

1973 forecasts explain 65% of the variance. Note in particular that, as
predicted by theory, the explanatory power of these forecasts is clearly

better in 1973 than in 1971. This finding contrasts sharply with the
results of simple data tabulations (section 4), which in general produce
longitudinal

patterns that are unfavorable to the expectations

hypothesis. We now see that

these

negative findings are largely

attributable to measurement error.

Table 10 also suggests that

incomplete use of available information. Augmentation of forecasts with
demographic information would achieve a minimal gain (less than a 5%
reduction in residual forecast error variance) in 1971, and no gain at

all in 1973. On the other hand, augmentation with information about
statutory entitlements (css) could

achieve

a reduction in residual

forecast error variance of between 14% and 17%. Thus, CSS emerges as
the most important piece of information that individuals fail to
incorporate fully into their forecasts.

I close this section with one final remark. While the existence
of measurement error is fully consistent with the results of this
section, there is another interpretation of the model described in

equations (3) through (6). Specifically, individuals may not know the
true empirical model, and may form expectations, X, that are related as

in equatIon (5) to the objective expectation, X, by some randomly
distributed term,

reflecting

idiosynchracies of the individual's

calculations. Under this view, one must adjust one's reading of my
results slightly. Specifically, the IV estimates indicate that
individuals on average form unbiased expectations. Furthermore, the
calculations of this subsection apply to the variance of the forecast
error for a particular individual (i.e., after adjusting the mean for
the Idiosynchratic component), rather than to the population variance.

sector. TIAA—CREF provides participants with an annual statement, which
specifies the level of annuity benefits available upon immediate

retirement, and projections of benefits besed on assumptions about

continued employment. Presunbly, the Social Security Administration
could provide each participant with similar information. If necessary,
the program could be restricted to individuals over a certain age.
According to my findings, most individuals would find this quite useful.

This paper leaves many important questions unanswered. In
subsequent work, I plan to focus on the evolution of expectations,

The RHS does not include married women as a separate

category. When surveying couples, the RHS always classifies the
husband as "respondent," and the wife as his spouse. In this
study, data on social security benefits for married men include

their spouse's benefits. For purposes of categorization, I take
the dividing lines for high wealth and high education to be
$20,000 and tenth grade, respectively——these figures correspond
roughly to medians.

Of course, the 1973 sample is not identical to the 1971 sample, so

caution is warranted. However, the average respondent in 1973 is
1.6 years older than the average respondent in 1971, and
accordingly more

advanced in the life cycle. It is therefore

appropriate to evaluate properties 2—4 by comparing data from 1971
and 1973.
