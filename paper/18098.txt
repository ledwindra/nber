Market Design in Cap and Trade Programs: Permit Validity and Compliance Timing
Stephen P. Holland and Michael R. Moore
NBER Working Paper No. 18098
May 2012
JEL No. H4,Q4,Q5
ABSTRACT
Cap and trade programs have considerable heterogeneity in permit validity and compliance timing.
For example, permits have different validity across time (e.g., banking, borrowing, and seasons) and
space (e.g., zonal restrictions), and compliance timing can be annual, in overlapping cycles, or in multi-year
periods. We compare and contrast nine prominent cap and trade programs along these dimensions
and construct a general model of permit validity and compliance timing. We derive sufficient conditions
under which abatement is invariant to compliance timing, i.e., compliance timing cannot smooth abatement
cost shocks. Under these conditions, i) expected compliance costs are invariant, ii) the variance of
compliance costs increases with delayed compliance, iii) equilibrium prices may not be unique, and
iv) the delayed compliance equilibrium may rely upon non-unique, “degenerate” prices not determined
by marginal abatement costs. Degenerate prices are unlikely to be discovered by market forces. We
then present two examples which are not invariant to compliance timing. If permit allocation is delayed
or if a price cap is implemented with a reserve fund, abatement may depend on compliance timing.
We demonstrate the model’s broad applicability by illustrating different types of temporal and spatial
permit validity.

1. Introduction
As the number of cap and trade programs for reducing pollution has increased, so
has their complexity along a number of dimensions. Programs now have a variety of
rules regarding emissions permit validity across time and space. For example, some
permits can be banked for future use; some can be borrowed for current use; some have
overlapping applicability periods; and some are restricted to certain regions within the
overall market. Similarly, a variety of rules exist for compliance timing and “true-up” of
emissions obligations.1 Some programs require annual compliance, some have
overlapping compliance cycles, and some delay compliance as much as four (!) years.
Given this breadth of approaches to permit validity and compliance timing, it is
imperative to understand i) which aspects of permit validity and compliance timing affect
market outcomes and compliance costs; and ii) the precise mechanisms for these effects.
This paper explores these questions by analyzing a general model of permit validity and
compliance timing.
Flexibility in permit validity across time and regions is a valuable tool for
reducing abatement costs.2 Whenever sources have different marginal abatement costs, a
cost reduction opportunity exists. Making permits valid for a wider range of compliance
obligations allows the program to realize more of these cost reduction opportunities by
trading. However, the regulator may wish to prohibit some trades if the marginal
damages are different across the two sources.3 Since requiring approval of individual
trades increases transaction costs, regulators generally define broad classes of permits
(vintages) with identical applicability criteria. Permit vintages allow emissions trading
programs to realize many cost reduction opportunities while avoiding pollution “hot
spots”.4

We use “compliance” and “true up” to refer to the process of reconciling a regulated facility’s observed
emissions with its permit holdings.
2
The literature on trading across time (banking and borrowing) is vast, e.g., Kling and Rubin (1997),
Schennach (2000), and Yates and Cronshaw (2001). See Montgomery (1972) and Fowlie and Muller
(2010) for analysis of trading across regions.
3
Specifically, the regulator would prohibit a trade if the difference in marginal damages between the source
increasing emissions and the source decreasing emissions is greater than the difference in marginal
abatement costs.
4
Muller and Mendelsohn (2009) argue that marginal damages should be incorporated directly into the
emissions trading program.

Similarly, flexibility in compliance timing and in true-up procedures is generally
thought to increase liquidity, to reduce compliance costs, and to provide flexibility to
adjust to cost shocks.5 Several programs have been quite creative in introducing
flexibility into compliance timing and true-up. For example, one program introduced two
separate compliance cycles based on the fiscal year and the calendar year. Another
program simply delays compliance until three or four years after the start of the program.
However, the precise mechanism by which delayed compliance could affect compliance
costs has not been specified.
Section 2 describes compliance timing; temporal and spatial restrictions on permit
validity; and permits-to-emissions compliance ratios across nine major cap and trade
programs. The programs have considerable heterogeneity across these dimensions.
There is dramatic variation in compliance timing, ranging from i) every year to ii) once
every three or four years to iii) overlapping compliance cycles to iv) partial compliance
requirements. Temporal restrictions on permit validity include provisions allowing (or
disallowing) i) banking, ii) borrowing, iii) borrowing with interest, and iv) borrowing
within a compliance period. Spatial restrictions on permit validity include implicit
restrictions through the limited geographic scope of a program and explicit limits on
trading within the program. Finally, programs have begun to experiment with different
permits-to-emissions compliance ratios to impose both temporal and spatial restrictions
on pollution. The heterogeneity across each of these dimensions is described in Section
2.
Section 3 presents a general model of permit validity and compliance timing that
allows for considerable flexibility along these dimensions. The first result from the
model derives sufficient conditions for the equilibrium to be invariant to compliance
timing. The first sufficient condition is that the current price equals the present value of
the expected future price. This is a standard arbitrage condition. The second sufficient
condition is quite general and applies to a wide range of program types. For example, it
applies if vintages of permits can be ranked by their applicability, such as with banking,
so that some permits are always more valuable than other.

See the discussions of compliance timing in RECLAIM and RGGI in Section 2.

The intuition of invariance to compliance timing follows from the information
contained in the current price. With prompt compliance, abatement is based on the
current price. With delayed compliance, abatement is based on the present value of the
expectation of the price at compliance time. If arbitrage equates the current price to the
discounted expected future price, then abatement is invariant to compliance timing.
Although abatement is invariant to compliance timing, compliance costs are not
invariant. The second result shows that, under the sufficient conditions, expected
compliance costs are invariant to delayed compliance, but the variance of compliance
costs increases with delayed compliance. Expected compliance costs are invariant since
the prompt compliance price equals the discounted expected price of delayed compliance.
However, with delayed compliance, the compliance costs may be either higher or lower
than the expected cost. Thus the variance increases.
Analysis of the model also shows that the equilibrium can have non-unique and
“degenerate prices”: equilibrium prices which are not determined by sloping supply and
demand functions, i.e., prices which are unlikely to be discovered by market forces. The
third result shows that the non-unique and degenerate prices are relied upon in
transactions under delayed compliance, but are irrelevant under prompt compliance. The
problem arises since the only elasticity in emissions markets occurs at the time the
emissions take place. Once the emissions leave the source, the emissions (and resulting
compliance obligation) are sunk. Since demand and supply are each perfectly inelastic at
a delayed compliance date, a variety of prices could clear the market. The equilibrium
prices can be determined by future abatement cost shocks and an arbitrage condition.
Degenerate prices are determined by the arbitrage condition (rather than by abatement
costs) and are prices that justify ex post the ex ante price expectation.
Despite the generality of the compliance invariance results, the sufficient
conditions do not hold for all possible programs. Section 3 presents two examples where
invariance fails. In the first example, the allocation of permits is delayed, and this
delayed allocation can lead to abatement which depends on compliance timing. The
intuition follows from a simple two year market. If very few permits are allocated in the
first year and compliance is prompt, then the first period permit price would be very high.
Delaying compliance would allow the permits allocated in the second year to be used for

3

the first period emissions and would lower the first period price. In this example, delayed
compliance reduces abatement costs, but does not reduce them below the level that would
have resulted with prompt allocations.
The second example involves a price ceiling supported by a reserve fund. The
analysis, which is based closely on Hasegawa and Salant (2010a and 2010b), shows that
the equilibrium may depend on compliance timing. To illustrate the intuition, suppose all
the permits are in the reserve fund and the reserve fund is large. Since the reserve fund is
large, the price will not exceed the ceiling. With delayed compliance, abatement is based
on the present value of the price ceiling, which is lower than the price ceiling. However,
with prompt compliance, abatement is based on the current price which must equal the
price ceiling. Thus the price is higher and emissions are lower with prompt compliance,
i.e., abatement depends on compliance timing.
The generality of the model is illustrated in Section 4 using several specific
features of temporal and spatial permit validity, including: banking, borrowing,
borrowing with interest, spatial segmentation, and permits-to-emissions compliance
ratios. Intertemporal prices grow at the rate of interest, following the arbitrage condition,
in the four temporal illustrations. Features of spatial validity can be used to decentralize
the efficient permit allocation. The set of illustrations demonstrate the model’s broad
applicability to market designs in practice.
The compliance invariance results show that delayed compliance cannot provide
flexibility for responding to cost shocks, since the equilibrium, even with cost shocks, is
invariant to whether compliance is prompt or delayed. This result undercuts one of the
primary rationales for delayed compliance, and suggests that regulators need to rely upon
broader permit validity and/or hybrid price containment mechanisms (e.g., reserve funds)
to provide flexibility.
The compliance invariance results are perhaps reassuring in light of the variety of
approaches programs take toward compliance timing. However, increased variance of
compliance costs, the reliance on non-unique and degenerate prices, and the potential
interactions with a reserve fund are factors that regulators would analyze carefully when
considering delayed compliance. Regulators can also assess other factors such as
administrative costs, salience of compliance costs, and complications from bankruptcy

4

when considering compliance timing. These conclusions are described more fully in
Section 5.

2. Provisions for Compliance Timing and Permit Validity in Cap and
Trade Programs
Cap and trade programs contain considerable differences in provisions for
compliance timing and permit validity across time and space. This section compares and
contrasts compliance timing, permit validity, and permits-to-emissions compliance ratios
in nine major cap and trade programs: the U.S. SO2 market (Acid Rain Program, Title IV
of Clean Air Act, or ARP)6; the U.S. NOx market (NOx Budget Trading Program or
NBP)7; the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule
(CSAPR)8, both of which regulate NOx and SO2 in the eastern U.S.; the Southern
California NOx market (RECLAIM) 9; the European Union’s CO2 market (Emissions
Trading System, or EU ETS)10; a legislative proposal in the U.S. Congress to establish a
U.S. CO2 market (Waxman-Markey H.R. 2454)11; the northeastern U.S. CO2 market
(RGGI)12; and the California CO2 market (AB 32). Table 1 outlines these provisions for
each program.

2.1 Compliance Timing
The most common approach to compliance timing is for true up on an annual
basis. The ARP, NBP, CAIR, EU ETS, and CSAPR all have annual compliance, and
Waxman-Markey would likely have required annual compliance. With annual
compliance, monitoring and reporting generally occur throughout the year.13 Regulated
facilities are required to operate monitoring equipment, such as a continuous emissions

monitoring system (CEMS), which records hourly emissions and/or heat input. Each
facility then submits a regular report of its emissions to the regulator who verifies the
emissions report and reconciles any discrepancies. For the ARP, the quarterly emissions
report is submitted electronically, and the first verification screen occurs electronically at
the time of filing. Any discrepancies in the report should be resolved within 30 days of
the deadline for filing the quarterly report. After the end of the year, there is generally a
trading period in which regulated facilities can buy or sell permits. At the end of the
trading period (for example, by March 1 for the ARP14), each regulated facility must
submit an annual compliance report verifying that all monitoring and reporting
requirements have been satisfied and specifying which permits are to be used for
compliance. 15 The facility’s account must have sufficient permits to cover the preceding
year’s emissions, and these permits are later deducted from the account. This process is
sometimes referred to as “true-up”. If there are insufficient permits in the account to
cover the obligation, the facility is considered to be out of compliance and penalties are
assessed. Generally, compliance rates are quite high.16
Three programs–RGGI, RECLAIM, and AB 32–have approaches to compliance
timing which are substantially different. RECLAIM has two overlapping compliance
cycles, each of which covers a 12-month period (SCAQMD 2009), with roughly equal
numbers of facilities in each cycle. Cycle 1 is based on the calendar-year (Jan. 1 - Dec.
31), and Cycle 2 is based on the fiscal-year (July 1 - June 30).17 Emissions are recorded
hourly, daily, or monthly depending on the size of the facility and are reported quarterly
by all facilities. For both compliance cycles, there is a 60-day reconciliation period at the
end of the respective cycle. Thus compliance and true-up occurs for half the facilities in
August and for half the facilities in February.
RECLAIM adopted overlapping compliance cycles to reduce administrative costs;
to increase liquidity and flexibility; and to allow firms to respond better to abatement cost

14

40 CFR Part 72.
If different vintage permits could be used to cover the obligation, the regulator either uses some rule for
determining which permits to deduct or allows the facility to specify which permits to deduct.
16
Schakenbach et al. (2006) claim compliance above 99% in ARP and NBP.
17
Emissions permits are similarly defined (i.e., have similar overlapping validity dates) but can be used by
facilities in either compliance cycle.
15

shocks.18 The overlapping compliance cycles mirror the overlapping permit cycles
(discussed below) and these two design features are frequently confused.19 Carlson et al.
(1993) carefully analyze both staggered compliance dates and staggered issue dates, but
do not experimentally analyze staggered issue dates without staggered compliance dates.
They find experimental evidence that staggered issue dates and compliance dates prevent
price spikes, and recommend both staggered issue dates and staggered compliance dates.
In the early years of the program (1994-1996), there were several cases where
facilities did not hold sufficient permits in their accounts at the required dates and later
were assessed monetary and permit penalties. These early instances of non-compliance
were likely exacerbated by administrative procedures on the part of RECLAIM (USEPA
2002). The emissions market was not substantially affected by these early violations
since the market had an excess supply of permits. Since 1997, there has been much better
compliance (rates typically in the 94-97% range) with no substantial violations.20
Compliance in RGGI is based on control periods. The first control period begins
January 1, 2009 (RGGI 2007, RGGI 2008). The control period is scheduled to be three
years but can be extended to a fourth year if a trigger event is declared (i.e., if the twelvemonth rolling average CO2 allowance price exceeds $10 adjusted for inflation.) The
monitoring and reporting requirements are based on those pioneered by ARP: i.e., each
facility is required to have monitoring equipment and to submit quarterly emissions
reports within 30 days of the end of the quarter. After the control period ends, there is a
transfer deadline on March 1 of the following year. By this date, sufficient permits must
be in the account in order for the facility to be in compliance for the preceding control
period. Note that under this system, a facility may not need to purchase the necessary
permits until up to four years (!) after the emissions occurred.
18

According to Carlson and Scholtz (1994), “staggered compliance periods smooth facilities' reactions to
unexpected events, resulting in pollution periods that should be less chaotic and less likely to yield NAAQS
violations; businesses will find the adjustment to tighter standards easier. Ultimately, the risks inherent in
pollution management are reduced.”
19
For example, Carlson and Scholtz (1994) implicitly recognize the difference between permit validity and
compliance timing when they note that facilities could receive a “mixed” allocation of permits. However,
their arguments for overlapping compliance cycles mix rationales for overlapping compliance cycles and
overlapping permit cycles.
20
Compliance rates are reported in the various issues of the RECLAIM Annual Report
(http://www.aqmd.gov/reclaim/reclaim_annurpt.htm).

7

The multi-year compliance periods were adopted to provide flexibility for
adjusting to cost variations, to reduce administrative costs, and to allow “de facto”
borrowing.21 Extended compliance periods are serving as a model for other programs,
e.g., the proposed Western Climate Initiative (2009) and Midwest Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Accord (2009) define three-year compliance periods in their draft model rules.
AB 32 has two forms of compliance timing: annual and triennial (California
Environmental Protection Agency, 2010). The first three-year compliance period is
slated for 2012-2014. For triennial compliance, facilities must have enough permits in
their accounts by November 1 of the following year to cover all their emissions over the
preceding three years. Any permit which is valid at that date can be used to cover any
obligation for triennial compliance. Annual compliance essentially requires a “down
payment” on true-up. By July 15 of each year, each facility must have sufficient permits
in its account to cover thirty percent of their emissions obligation from the preceding
year. For this down payment, the allocation year of the permit must be the current year
or an earlier year. For example, a 2013 permit is not valid for covering the annual down
payment on 2012 emissions but would be acceptable for covering the remaining balance
beyond the down payment at triennial compliance. Annual emission reports are required,
and AB 32 includes a novel element of third-party verification of each report.

2.2 Permit Validity
In the simplest cap and trade program, any permit could be used by any facility at
any time to cover any emissions obligation, and all permits would be perfect substitutes.
No program is this simple, since unrestricted trading could allow temporal or spatial
hotspots in pollution. Every program limits the validity of permits in some way, such
that not all permits are perfect substitutes. To facilitate trading, programs generally
create groups of permits which can be used to satisfy the same emissions obligations and
are perfect substitutes. We call these groups of permits vintages.
21

“Multi-year compliance periods were employed to provide regulated facilities more flexibility to adjust
to variations in electricity demand (driven by meteorology and load growth), fuel price spikes, clean unit
outages, etc. A longer compliance period may also lead to resource (administrative) savings for the
regulated facilities and the states implementing the program. This design component was included in lieu of
allowance borrowing, as it allows for de facto borrowing within a three-year compliance period.” RGGI
(2007)

8

The four key features of a permit vintage are the permit’s expiration date (the last
date of emissions for which the permit can be used), its start date (the first date of
emissions for which the permit can be used), its spatial applicability (which facilities can
use it), and how much emissions each permit covers. In practice, permits are generally
labeled with an allocation year, and expiration and start dates are determined by whether
a permit can be banked (i.e., used after its allocation year) or borrowed (i.e., used before
its allocation year). The programs take a variety of approaches to temporal restrictions
(through banking and borrowing), spatial limitations, and permits-to-emissions
compliance ratios.
In program design, permit validity involves a trade-off between abatement costs and
damages. Broader permit validity allows for more trading which reduces abatement
costs. However, broader permit validity can allow pollution “hot-spots” either
temporally or spatially. Thus programs to control pollutants with more temporal and
spatial heterogeneity in damages (e.g., ozone) would have more restrictions on permit
validity, whereas permits for pollutants with less temporal and spatial heterogeneity (e.g.,
CO2) would have fewer restrictions on permit validity.
Temporal restrictions in permit validity
Banking provisions are generally much less restrictive than borrowing provisions.
For example, ARP, CAIR, and CSAPR have unlimited banking but no borrowing. One
reason for this may be that borrowing can affect a program’s credibility. For example, if
borrowing were excessive, the limited supply of remaining permits (and resulting price
spike) would likely force regulators to intervene.22 However, the likelihood of
intervention can make excessive borrowing optimal. In the extreme case of unlimited
borrowing, the equilibrium could have a permit price of zero (i.e., no abatement)
followed by a forced regulator intervention. Unlimited banking does not raise similar
credibility issues.

22

For example, RECLAIM administrators were forced to intervene in 2001 when the permit price spiked,
see Holland and Moore (2012).

9

Despite concerns about program credibility, some programs have attempted to
incorporate borrowing since borrowing can decrease abatement costs. In particular, the
proposals regulating CO2 in the US Congress allow some restricted borrowing. For
example, Waxman-Markey, which has unlimited banking, allows borrowing only from
allocations up to five years in the future and only for up to 15 percent of a regulated
facility’s annual emissions. The program further limits borrowing by requiring the
regulated facility to retire additional permits as “interest” payments. Borrowing from the
next year’s allocation occurs without interest. However, borrowing from vintages two to
five years in the future requires an interest payment computed by multiplying 0.08 times
“the number of years between the calendar year in which the allowance is being used …
and the vintage year of the allowance”.23, 24
RGGI, which also regulates CO2 and has unrestricted banking, only allows
borrowing within the three-year control period. According to a program overview, “This
design component was included in lieu of allowance [permit] borrowing, as it allows for
de facto borrowing within a three-year compliance period” (RGGI 2007). Thus, permits
can only be borrowed from at most four years in the future in the event of a declared
emergency.
California’s AB 32 has similar provisions to RGGI: unlimited banking along with
borrowing of annual allowances within a three-year compliance period. AB 32’s annual
requirement for a thirty percent down payment on emissions compliance limits borrowing
in each year to no more than seventy percent of the emissions obligation. This generous
limit on borrowing is unlikely to be binding.
The EU-ETS, which also regulates CO2, placed restrictions on both banking and
borrowing. Permits from its first period (2005-07) could be banked but only until the end
of this period. Permits from the second period (2008-12) have unlimited banking.
Borrowing is allowed but only implicitly through a compliance provision. A permit can
be borrowed forward by one year, as “allowances [permits] for each year are to be issued

23

For example, if the calendar year is 2012 and the borrowed vintage year is 2016, the interest payment is
0.32 [=0.08*(2016-2012)] permits per borrowed permit.
24
These interest payments are formally equivalent to an increased permit-to-emissions compliance ratio as
discussed below.

10

before February 28, while compliance for the previous year is assessed after April 30.
This allows de facto borrowing between January and May, as participants can use this
period to make up for a deficit in their holdings” (Convery and Redmond 2007).25
This market design led to some interesting price dynamics in the EU-ETS.
Despite the fact that permits from the two periods are not substitutable in any way, the
prices tracked quite closely until 2007. On April 25, 2006, the price of the first-period
vintages crashed eventually falling to virtually zero while second-period vintages traded
in the €15-25 range. (Ellerman and Joskow 2008; Bushnell, Chong, and Mansur 2009).
Markets for NOx (an ozone precursor) must be more careful about temporal
hotspots and tend to have more restrictions on both banking and borrowing. The NBP
does not allow any borrowing and restricts banking through a “flow control” provision
(EPA 2005a, EPA 2005b). Under this provision, banked permits cover emissions at a 1:1
ratio until the total number of banked permits exceeds 10% of the yearly permit
allocation. If this flow control provision is triggered, a flow control ratio is calculated. 26
The flow control ratio is then applied to each facility’s account of banked permits at
compliance time and determines the proportion of the banked permits which cover
emissions at a 1:1 ratio and at a 2:1 ratio.27 Thus flow control reduces the value of
banked permits when the trigger is exceeded. The flow control trigger has regularly been
exceeded and banked permits have been used at the 2:1 ratio.28 CAIR did not continue
the NBP’s flow control provision after 2009, and neither will CSAPR beginning 2012.
Another NOx market (RECLAIM) ruled out banking “because of concerns that
the ability to use banked emissions might lead to substantial increases in actual emissions
in some future year, and thus delay compliance with ambient air quality standards”
25

Ellerman and Trotignon (2009) develop evidence of both borrowing and banking in the EU ETS during
2005-2007.
26
The flow control ratio is defined as
10% * permit allocation for year t
_
aggregate banked permits at compliance time t-1
Note that the flow control ratio is between 0 and 1, and equals 1 if the flow control trigger is just binding.
27
For example, suppose the flow control provision is triggered and the flow control ratio is 0.25. If a
facility has 1000 banked permits, these banked permits could cover only 625 tons of emissions
(250+750/2).

(Ellerman, Joskow, and Harrison 2003, 21). Similarly, borrowing was not allowed.
However, the program designers did attempt to allow some limited intertemporal trading
through overlapping permit cycles. The overlapping permit cycles mimic RECLAIM’s
overlapping compliance cycles described above. In particular, all permits are valid for
twelve months, but some permits expire in December and other expire in June.
Importantly any facility can use any unexpired permit, although facilities were only
allocated permits whose validity dates match their compliance cycle. Holland and Moore
(2012) model the scope for intertemporal trading in RECLAIM and show empirical
evidence consistent with intertemporal trading.
Banking and borrowing create explicit limitations on intertemporal trading.
However, some programs create implicit limitations on intertemporal trading through the
scope of the program. Most prominently, NBP was only in effect during the summer
ozone season. The limited scope of the NBP implicitly prevented trading between the
summer ozone season and the winter. CAIR and CSAPR, which were built on NBP, then
established two distinct seasonal NOx markets. The summer ozone season program
regulates NOx emissions during the summer when marginal damages from ozone are
highest. The annual program regulates NOx emissions year-round to manage particulate
formation. These overlapping regulatory seasons continue this barrier to intertemporal
NOx trading.
Spatial Restrictions in Permit Validity
Some programs, especially those regulating local pollutants, place restrictions on
the geographic validity of permits. Since CO2 is a global pollutant, none of the programs
regulating CO2 define explicit spatial restrictions. Other programs limit spatial trading
either implicitly by the geographic scope of the program (e.g., RECLAIM applies only to
the Los Angeles region and CAIR only applies to the eastern U.S.) or explicitly by
restricting permit validity.29
In addition to the narrow geographic scope of program, RECLAIM defines two

They estimate that net benefits could increase by 17% by incorporating more spatial heterogeneity in the
program.

12

spatial zones in the greater Los Angeles region: coastal and inland. Due to the natural
airflow from west to east, trading permits from the inland to the coastal region would
increase coastal pollution but may not reduce inland pollution. Conversely, trading
permits from the coastal to the inland region would increase inland pollution but would
definitely decrease coastal pollution. To discourage trading permits from the inland to
the coastal region, regulators assigned facilities to coastal and inland zones and similarly
designated permits as coastal or inland. Inland facilities can use either permits, whereas
coastal facilities can only use coastal permits. This explicit spatial limitation reduces the
local damages of trading.
CAIR supplements ARP in regulating SO2 emissions by reducing the geographic
scope of the program. While ARP covers the conterminous United States, CAIR covers a
smaller region of 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. This narrower
geographic scope—together with higher permits-to-emissions compliance ratios,
discussed below—is meant to address the regional contributions of SO2 emissions to
local particulate matter pollution.
Under CAIR, the two temporally segmented NOx programs are also segmented
spatially. Twenty-two eastern states operate with both the seasonal and the annual NOx
programs. An additional three states are in the seasonal program, and another three states
are in the annual program. As mentioned above, the temporal and spatial segmentation of
the NOx programs is due to different air quality issues: ozone and particulate matter.
As the replacement of CAIR, CSAPR continues a similar spatial structure for the
two NOx programs (USEPA, 2011). It also creates two spatially distinct SO2 markets in
the eastern United States. One market covers 16 states (“Group 1” states) with facilities
subject to relatively higher emission reductions. A second market covers 7 states
(“Group 2” states) with facilities subject to relatively lower emission reductions. Permits
allocated or defined for one market cannot be used for compliance with the other market.
To limit leakage in the electricity sector, CO2 emissions from the generation of
electricity imported to California are regulated under AB 32 (California Environmental
Protection Agency, 2010). A firm that holds title to the electricity as it enters the state is

13

the regulated entity. This provision is unusual in that it enlarges rather than restricts the
geographic validity of permits.

2.3 Permits-to-Emissions Compliance Ratios
In cap and trade programs, facilities do not trade “emissions” but rather permits
(e.g., “title IV SO2 allowances” and “RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTCs)”). Typically
one permit offsets one ton of pollution: e.g., one title IV SO2 allowance is retired for each
ton of SO2 emissions and one RTC is retired for each ton of NOx emissions. However,
some programs have modified this simple 1:1 linkage in order to introduce more flexible
spatial and temporal limitations. We call these restrictions permits-to-emissions
compliance ratios. Most programs (e.g., ARP, RECLAIM, RGGI, and the EU-ETS)
have 1:1 compliance ratios; however some programs have higher compliance ratios.
One example is the NBP. As discussed above, if the flow control provision is
triggered a proportion of the facility’s banked permits can only be used at a 2:1 ratio
rather than at a 1:1 ratio. Another example is “borrowing with interest” in WaxmanMarkey, which is essentially an increased compliance ratio.
CAIR uses compliance ratios to reduce SO2 emissions in the eastern United
States. The CAIR SO2 program, which was built on ARP and used ARP permits,
requires higher compliance ratios for permits with vintages after 2010. In particular,
permit allocations for 2010 to 2014 have a 2:1 compliance ratio and permit allocations
beyond 2014 have a 2.86:1 compliance ratio. This provision effectively reduces the cap
by increasing the compliance ratio above 1:1.30 SO2 permits continue to cover emissions
at the 1:1 ratio specified in ARP in states outside of the CAIR region.
CSAPR also introduces the possibility of a higher compliance ratio through an
“assurance provision” on SO2 and NOx emissions at the state level (USEPA, 2011). A
“variability limit” is set at a state’s annual allocation of permits plus an additional 18
percent of the allocation for the annual program and plus 21 percent for the seasonal NOx
program. If emissions from facilities in the state exceed the variability limit, a 2:1
30

Interestingly, the effect on permit prices is ambiguous: each permit is less valuable, but equilibrium
marginal abatement cost increases.

14

compliance ratio switches on; offending facilities must surrender two permits, not one,
for each ton of excess emissions. This assurance provision is intended to remedy a legal
weakness of CAIR by providing disincentive for interstate trading.

3. A Model of Permit Validity and Compliance Timing
To analyze permit validity and compliance timing, we develop a model of a
perfectly competitive emissions permits market. After deriving the main results on
compliance timing invariance, we also consider cases in which equilibria can vary with
compliance timing.

3.1 The model
Consider a model of permit validity and compliance timing in a cap and trade
program. The regulator creates and defines emissions permits which participating
facilities use to satisfy their compliance obligations.31 Define a vintage as a class of
permits with identical applicability criteria.32 Since permits within a vintage are perfect
substitutes, they trade at a common price. Let  be the price of a vintage  permit in
period .33 Assume the regulator issues  permits of vintage .

be emissions from facility in period , and let the abatement cost function

facility realizes its abatement cost shock and decides how much to abate. Assume that
abatement costs are convex in emissions with

31

The permits can be grandfathered or auctioned. For now, we assume permits are allocated at the start of
the program.
32
To be precise, if one permit in vintage j can be used by facility i to satisfy a given compliance obligation
from emissions at time t, then any permit in vintage j can be used to satisfy the same compliance obligation.
33
The period of analysis can be quite general, e.g., monthly or yearly, but we assume the first period of the
program is t=1.
34
Appendix A presents the simpler model without the abatement cost shock.
35
Emissions control technology may require capital investments. Delaying these investments may have an
option value. Here we focus on marginal (rather than fixed) abatement costs which determine the prices of
emissions permits.

15

To model compliance timing, let  () be facility ’s compliance time for period 

emissions where  () ≥ , i.e., compliance cannot take place before emissions occur.

We distinguish prompt compliance from delayed compliance, with prompt meaning that
compliance is required in each period and delayed pertaining to all other cases. By

definition,  () =  with prompt compliance. In a program where compliance first

occurs three years after the start of the program, i.e., similar to RGGI, then  (1) = 3;

 (2) = 3; and  (3) = 3, and the program requires delayed compliance. Note that the

compliance time need not be the same for all facilities (e.g., RECLAIM has two separate
compliance cycles).
In a compliance period, the facility must determine how many permits of each

vintage to utilize to cover past emissions. Let   () be the set of periods for which

compliance occurs in t , i.e.,   () ≡ ′| (  ) = ". Note that   is a

correspondence and is the “inverse correspondence” of the function  . Further note that

  () can be the empty set, in which case  is not a compliance period. If   ∈   (),

let $  % be facility ’s demand for permit vintage  to cover period ′ emissions. This
demand need not be determined until the compliance period .

To model permit validity, define the compliance factor as the amount of

emissions obligations covered by one permit. Specifically, let the compliance factor & 

be the amount of facility ’s period  emissions covered by one permit of vintage . The

factor &  is very general and can model spatial limits, temporal limits, different permitsto-emissions compliance ratios, and negative marginal damages (see Fowlie and Mueller
2010).36 Importantly, if facility cannot use permit vintage  for emissions at time  due
to spatial or temporal limits, then &  = 0.

Each facility minimizes compliance costs by choosing emissions in each period

and how many permits of each vintage to use. Let facility ’s value function in period 

be '  ( ̅  ;   ). The value function depends on past emissions (the vector ̅  ) for which

compliance may not have occurred and on the current cost shock.37 The facility’s
Bellman equation is then

36
37

If the permits-to-emissions compliance ratio is 2:1, then the compliance factor is 0.5.
The initial emissions vector is the zero vector, i.e., ̅ ) = 0.

The Bellman equation in Eq. 1 states that the optimal value of a given vector of past
emissions and a realized cost shock is the minimized current abatement costs plus
compliance costs plus the discounted expected optimized future value. The first term in
the Bellman objective is the abatement cost. The second term in the Bellman is the
compliance cost and is zero if period  is not a compliance period, i.e., if   () is

empty. In a compliance period , this term sums over all periods ′, which are “trued-

up” in period . For each of these periods, ′, the summation is over demands for all

vintages. Note that the relevant permit price for compliance is the price at compliance

time . Even if the facility had purchased permits to cover its emissions obligation when

the emissions occurred at time   , as might be prudent, the relevant opportunity cost is the

price of the permits at the time when they must be surrendered to cover the compliance
obligation. The third term in the Bellman is the discounted, period  expectation of the
optimized future value where  is the period  expectation operator.

Optimization of the Bellman in Eq. 1 is subject to two constraints. The constraint

in Eq. 2 updates the th element of the past emissions vector so that the vector ̅ 8 has

period ′ emissions as the ′th element but leaves every other element unchanged, i.e.,
̅ 8 =
%

% ,

for   ≤  and has ̅ 8 = 0 for   > . The constraint in Eq. 3 ensures that
%

demand for permits—weighted by compliance factors—is sufficient to cover the past

emissions in the compliance period .

The optimization in the Bellman can be simplified by noting that the objective

and constraint are linear in the demands $  . It is easy to show that optimality with

respect to $  of Eq. 1 subject to Eq. 3 requires ∑  $  % = min F 1/ I ̅ 8 .38

Intuitively, least cost compliance for period ′ emissions requires choosing the cheapest
applicable permits. Substituting this optimality equation into Eq. 1, shows that the
optimization in Eq. 1-3 can be simplified to this Bellman:

Thus if period  is a compliance period, the firm sets the marginal abatement cost equal to

Now consider the first order condition if  is not a compliance period, i.e., if

 () > . An increase in emissions does not lead to an immediate compliance liability,
but rather increases the stock of past emissions for which compliance has not yet

occurred (the relevant element of the vector ̅ 8) which affects ' 8 ( ̅ 8 ;  8 ). The

first order condition can then be written:

follows from differentiation of Eq. 4 in the compliance period. Intuitively, Eq. 6 states
that the facility sets marginal abatement costs equal to the period  expectation of the
discounted price of the cheapest valid permit at the compliance time.

Eq. 5 and Eq. 6 characterize the facility’s abatement/emissions decision—
conditional on the price—for periods which are and are not compliance periods. To

derive the demand for permits, we must go back to the $  , which are the demands for

the permits of each vintage.39 Summing over time periods, ∑ $  , gives facility ’s

demand for permits of vintage . Summing over facilities, ∑ ∑ $  , gives the market

demand for permits of vintage . Since the supply of each vintage of permits is fixed, the
equilibrium must have ∑ ∑ $  = \ for each vintage .

The equilibrium is not completely characterized by equating supply and demand,

since there are time dated prices. Complete characterization of the equilibrium requires a
condition on the relationship of prices across time, i.e., an arbitrage condition. Assume
market participants (possibly speculators) would buy and hold all permits if  <

prompt compliance, Eq. 7 shows that



would be invariant to compliance timing if the

price path is invariant. We show in Appendix A that the equilibrium price path is
invariant since supply and demand are invariant to compliance timing.∎
The intuition of the result follows from comparing prompt compliance with
delayed compliance. With prompt compliance, the facility sets its marginal abatement
cost equal to the cheapest current price. With delayed compliance, the facility sets its
marginal abatement cost equal to the cheapest expected future price. However, by the
sufficient condition, the current price equals the expected future price. Thus the
equilibrium is invariant to the delayed compliance.
The intuition of the result also follows from the cost-effectiveness of emissions
trading. The emissions target of a cap and trade program is defined by the cap, i.e., by
the permit supply and validity dates of permits. It is well known that cap and trade is cost
effective, i.e., attains the emissions target at least cost.40 Thus the prompt compliance
equilibrium is cost effective. However, the delayed compliance equilibrium must also be
cost effective and attains the same emissions target, i.e., delayed compliance does not
affect the permit supply or validity dates of permits. Thus, the prompt and delayed
compliance equilibria must be the same.

The first sufficient condition,  = 7 

% 

  % , states that the present value of

the current price equals the present value of the expected future price. This condition,

which is similar to the efficient markets hypothesis, would be enforced by intertemporal
arbitrage by permit holders. Note that this sufficient condition might not hold, for
example, if the regulator imposed price regulation or if the regulator injected or removed
permits into the market. We return to these examples in Section 3.2.

for a different realization of the cost shock. This cannot happen if one vintage of permits
is always more valuable than another substitute vintage, e.g., if permit validity is
“nested”. With banking, for example, the earlier permits have wider applicability and can
substitute for later permits, so the earlier permits are always more valuable. Even in
RECLAIM where permit validity is not nested, when the abatement decision is made, the
validity dates of the relevant permits are nested and the condition holds. In fact, we have
been unable to construct a counter example where this condition fails to hold.
Although Result 1 shows that delayed compliance does not affect abatement
costs, it does affect compliance costs. We present the second result as a corollary:
Corollary 1: Under the sufficient conditions of Result 1, the expected present value
compliance costs are invariant to delayed compliance but the variance of compliance
costs is higher with delayed compliance.
Proof: See Appendix A.∎
The intuition of Corollary 1 is quite straightforward. The sufficient condition

 = 7 

% 

  % implies that expectation of the present value of the current and future

prices are equal, thus expected compliance costs are equal. Delaying compliance,

however, means that compliance is settled at a later price, which is essentially the earlier
price plus white noise. Thus the variance of compliance costs is higher, while the
expected compliance costs are unchanged.
The invariance result and corollary are illustrated in Fig. 1 for a representative
firm. The simplest illustration of delayed compliance timing involves two periods and a
single vintage (vintage A) of permits, i.e., full banking and borrowing. Since

`

\X , i.e., total emissions equal the cap, the example can be illustrated by measuring period
1 emissions from the left axis and period 2 emissions from the right axis where the width
of the graph is \X . Marginal abatement costs for period 1 emissions, − , are downward

sloping from the left axis and discounted marginal abatement costs for period 2

emissions, −7 `, are downward sloping from the right axis, i.e., upward sloping. The

figure illustrates second period marginal abatement costs in present value and a discrete
cost shock in the second period which can be either high (−7

In the prompt compliance equilibrium, since permits must be used in each period

and held across both periods, the sufficient condition holds: X = 7X` . By the first

order conditions, we have −  (  ) = X = 7X` = 7 ` ( ` ) , thus marginal

abatement costs in the first period equal expected marginal abatement costs in the second
period. Once period 1 emissions are chosen, emissions in period 2 simply exhaust the
remaining permits and the price is determined by the marginal abatement cost as
illustrated.
Since there is only a single vintage of permits used in both periods, both sufficient
conditions hold, and the equilibrium is invariant to delayed compliance. With delayed
compliance, the facility sets −  (  ) = 7X` . Since this gives exactly the same

with prompt compliance, the equilibrium is invariant.

Compliance costs, however, do depend on compliance timing. With prompt

7X`

expected present value abatement costs are equal, but the variance is higher with delayed
compliance since compliance for period 1 emissions has the additional white noise term
7X` − X .

Analysis of abatement cost shocks yields an additional insight about compliance

timing: namely, equilibrium prices may not be unique and may be “degenerate”. Define
degenerate prices as equilibrium prices which are not determined by sloping supply or
demand curves. In this model, they are thus prices which are not determined by marginal
abatement costs. Degenerate prices are problematic since a Walrasian tâtonnement
process is unlikely to discover them.
To demonstrate non-unique and degenerate prices, Fig. 2 extends the example
illustrated in Fig. 1 to include two permit vintages.41 Assume vintage A permits can be
used in either period, but vintage B permits cannot be used in the first period, i.e.,

&X = &X` = &Z` = 1 and &Z = 0, e.g., banking with no borrowing. Note that vintage
A permits have broader applicability and hence are more valuable for any cost shock.
Assume all permits are allocated initially so that permits are held and used in both

invariant to compliance timing.
Fig. 2 illustrates the equilibrium for three different cost shock realizations in the
first period. Panel A shows the equilibrium if the marginal abatement costs are high in
period 1. In this equilibrium, the firm would like to use vintage B permits. Thus, it uses
all the vintage A permits in the first period. In this case, markets are completely
segregated so

For Panel A, the equilibrium vintage A prices are not unique in the second period.

With prompt compliance, all vintage A permits are used in period 1, and no permits are

since supply and demand are zero in period 2. With delayed compliance, similar

Unfortunately, non-uniqueness is relevant, since supply and demand are non-zero (equal
to \X ) in period 2 with delayed compliance. Note that any period 2, vintage A price not
equal to X is degenerate.

Panel B shows the equilibrium if the marginal abatement costs are somewhat

lower in period 1. In this equilibrium, the firm would like to use vintage B permits in
expectation. Thus, it uses all the vintage A permits in the first period, so

permits must also rise, otherwise demand for vintage A permits would exceed supply.

As in Panel A, the non-unique and degenerate period 2 prices are irrelevant with
prompt compliance since supply and demand for vintage A permits are zero in period 2.
However, with delayed compliance, the non-unique and degenerate period 2 prices are
relevant since vintage A permits must be held until the second period.
Panel C shows the equilibrium if the marginal abatement costs are low in period
1. In this equilibrium, the firm would not want to borrow vintage B permits. In this case,
markets are integrated; there is banking,



< \X ; and

`

> \Z ; and the prices of vintage

A and vintage B permits are equal in all contingencies. In fact, this is the equilibrium
that would result with unlimited banking and borrowing as in Fig. 1.
We now state the second result:
Result 2: Non-unique and Degenerate Prices. The equilibrium prices may not be

unique, and the equilibrium may require degenerate prices. These prices are relevant to
the compliance decision iff compliance is delayed.

Proof: The possibility result is proved by the preceding example. ∎

The example showing non-unique and degenerate prices is not an exceptional

case in several respects. It does not require an extreme cost draw. It also does not
require banking and similar examples could be constructed for borrowing. Moreover, the
example does not require a discrete cost shock, and similar examples could be
constructed for a continuously distributed cost shock. 45
The intuition of non-unique and degenerate prices can be explained by supply and
demand in the permit market. In this model, supply is determined by the cap and hence is
perfectly inelastic. Demand for permits is determined by marginal abatement costs and is
elastic. However, once emissions occur, the demand for permits becomes perfectly
inelastic.46 With delayed compliance, both supply and demand are perfectly inelastic at
the time of compliance, and hence any price can clear the market. Which price
45

For this example with a continuous cost shock in Panel B, the price of vintage A permits in the second
period would be distributed over an interval with positive density and a mass point on the lowest price in
the interval. This mass point would be above the marginal abatement cost, i.e., would be degenerate.
46
We assume throughout, quite reasonably (!), that emissions cannot be “unemitted” after they are emitted.

24

distribution is the actual equilibrium price distribution can depend on later abatement
costs and the arbitrage condition. For degenerate prices, it is the arbitrage condition
(rather than later abatement costs) which determines the degenerate prices.

3.2 Equilibria that vary with compliance timing
The invariance result is quite general and applies to a broad class of cap and trade
markets. However, some market designs may not satisfy the sufficient conditions and
hence the equilibrium may not be invariant. This subsection first shows that the
equilibrium may vary if permit allocation is delayed such that permits are allocated after
their first date of validity. Although not common in market designs, the EU-ETS and
RGGI delay permit allocation. We then present an example with a price cap and reserve
fund from Hasegawa and Salant (2010a, 2010b). This equilibrium is also not invariant to
compliance timing. Several proposed cap and trade markets use price caps supported by
reserve funds.
If permit allocation is delayed, the equilibrium may not be invariant since the
supply of permits is not time invariant, and thus the current price may not equal the
expected future price. This possibility is illustrated in Fig. 3. The simple two-period
example in Fig. 3 assumes a single vintage of permits, which can be used in both periods,
no cost shocks, and no discounting. The allocation of permits is delayed: \X of the

permits are allocated in the first period, and \X` of the permits are allocated in the second

period. The cap is the total vintage A permits allocated \X = \X + \X` . As illustrated in

Fig. 3, the allocation of a relatively large proportion of the cap is delayed.

First consider the equilibrium with prompt compliance. The supply of permits at

the first compliance time is \X . Thus emissions in the first period cannot exceed \X .

As illustrated the first period allocation is relatively small, so first period emissions are
c
\X and second period emissions are \X`. The equilibrium prices are X
= −  (\X )
c
and X`
= − ` (\X` ). Note that−  (\X ) > − ` (\X` ), so the facility would like to

increase period 1 emissions and reduce period 2 emissions. However, this is not feasible

25

since the necessary permits are not available at compliance time. Note also that since
c
c
X
> X`
, the sufficient condition of the theorem does not hold.47

Now consider the equilibrium with delayed compliance. In the compliance period

the supply of permits is \X + \X` . Since all permits are perfect substitutes, they trade at
d
. First period emissions are determined by the expectation of this
a common price X`
d
=
price, and second period emissions are determined by this price so −  (  ) = X`

− ` ( ` ) and marginal abatement costs are equal. Since permits allocated in the first
d
d
period must be held to the second period, X
= X`
.

The example shows that delayed allocations can lead to different equilibria with

prompt and delayed compliance. In addition, the delayed compliance equilibrium has
lower abatement costs.48
The Hasegawa-Salant example, which analyzes price collars, is motivated by
Waxman-Markey. Waxman-Markey has a strategic reserve fund, which would hold
quarterly auctions with a reserve price of $28 adjusted for inflation. This reserve fund
would act as a price ceiling at $28. Other programs have similar price containment
mechanisms. For example, RECLAIM did not have an explicit price containment
mechanism but regulators were forced to intervene in 2001 to prevent the price from
going too high. AB 32 has an “allowance price containment reserve” which releases
additional permits in three tiers at prices of $40, $45, and $50. RGGI allows increasing
use of offsets when prices exceed trigger prices. Such price containment mechanisms are
increasingly common in permit market design.
The invariance result may also fail in a market with a price cap supported by a

reserve fund. To illustrate the Hasegawa-Salant example, consider a market that lasts e

years, with a single vintage of permits, no cost shock, and an initial cap of . The price

ceiling is set at ̅ and is implemented by a reserve fund of f permits available at a price
of ̅ .
47

Short selling would not be possible, since there is no one from whom to borrow permits.
It is worth noting, however, that the lower costs from delayed compliance only arise because the
regulator failed to allocate sufficient permits in the first period and the shortage of available permits
prevented cost-reducing trades. In fact, if sufficient permits were allocated in the first period, then the
equilibrium would be invariant.
48

26

Compare delayed compliance in year e versus prompt (continuous) compliance.

With delayed compliance all compliance obligations are settled at time e at the price g .

With prompt compliance, obligations are settled at each time  at the prevailing price  .
The price must grow at the rate of interest if permits are being held.

The equilibrium may or may not utilize the reserve fund of permits. For example,
if permits are relatively abundant, permit demand from a price path growing at the rate of
interest to ̅ may not exceed . In this case, the reserve fund would be unused whether

compliance is prompt or delayed, and the equilibrium would be invariant to compliance
timing. However, if the initial cap were tighter, then the reserve fund would be used.
The solid line in Fig. 4 illustrates delayed compliance in a case where the reserve

fund is used completely and the price grows from )0 to g0 which is above ̅ . Hasegawa

and Salant point out the interesting dynamics of the reserve fund which is completely

depleted in a speculative attack in year ` . Speculators are willing to buy permits at time
` and hold them until time e since they can sell them to regulated facilities at time e at

price g0 . Regulated facilities recognize that they will be able to buy permits at time e at
the price g0 , and that there will  + f permits available. Thus abatement decisions are

made based on the expected price at time e, so the price path )0 to g0 is the equilibrium

price path.

With delayed compliance, it is irrelevant whether the facilities use the reserve

fund permits to cover emissions from before or after ` since all emissions are trued up at
time e. All that matters for the equilibrium price path is the total number of permits

available at time e:  + f, i.e., the distribution of the permits between the initial cap and

the reserve fund is immaterial.

With prompt compliance, Hasegawa and Salant point out that the distribution of
the permits between the initial cap and the reserve fund can matter. Importantly, if the
initial cap is small enough, then there may not be enough permits in the initial cap to

cover demand for permits along the price path )0 to 0h . Suppose, for example, that the

initial cap is exhausted at time  along this price path. If compliance is delayed, the
facility simply sets its marginal abatement cost equal to 06 . Although there are no

permits available from the initial cap at time  , the facility can safely wait until e to buy
27

the permits from the speculators.49 With prompt compliance, the facility has no such

option. It must procure the permits at time  and the only place to get permits is from

the reserve fund at price ̅ . But since ̅ > 06 , the marginal abatement cost would be less

than the permit price, so the facility would optimally reduce emissions. Hasegawa and
Salant show that in equilibrium the facilities bid up the price of the initial-cap permits.

The equilibrium for prompt compliance and a tight initial cap is illustrated by the

G
dashed line in Fig. 4. The price path grows at the rate of interest from ) to ̅ , at which

time the initial-cap permits are exhausted. Facilities then purchase permits from the

reserve fund at the price ̅ from time  to i and use them for immediate compliance.

No speculator would be willing to hold permits from  to i since there is no capital gain

on the permits. At i there is a speculative attack on the reserve fund and speculators

hold the permits or sell them for immediate use between i and e. (See Hasegawa and

Salant.)

Hasegawa and Salant also compare the efficiency of the two equilibria. Under the
assumption that non-constant marginal damages are stationary, both equilibria are
inefficient since they inefficiently delay abatement.50 Note that the delayed compliance
equilibrium delays abatement more than the prompt compliance equilibrium, i.e., delayed
compliance exacerbates the welfare losses. In effect, prompt compliance restricts
inefficient borrowing from the reserve fund. If on the other hand damages are constant or
only depend on total emissions, then delaying abatement reduces costs. In this case,
delayed compliance increases welfare.

4. Illustrating the model for common market designs
To illustrate the generality of the model, this section illustrates common market
designs in the framework of the model. We first illustrate temporal restrictions on permit
validity and then spatial restrictions on permit validity.

49
50

Or buy the permits themselves at time ` .
This inefficiency was first pointed out by Kling and Rubin (1997).

28

4.1 Temporal permit restrictions
We illustrate the model for four common restrictions on permit validity across
time: banking, borrowing, overlapping vintages, and costly borrowing. Fig. 5 illustrates
the equilibrium permit price across twelve quarters for the model with these four designs.
By assuming that abatement costs are stationary (and certain) across the twelve quarters,
abatement and emissions are captured completely by the permit price. In short, a higher
permit price implies more abatement and lower emissions. We also assume that the
regulator makes equal permit allocations across vintages, i.e., the regulator is not trying
to reduce emissions over time but rather to hold emissions at a desired level. Thus we are
illustrating the steady-state of the market perhaps after some transition phase in which
permits (and hence emissions) decrease over time.
Each panel of Fig. 5 illustrates a different market design in terms. In each panel,
the permit price for each quarter is illustrated if the permit is valid for that quarter.51 The
permit price is circled if there is positive demand for the permit at that price (i.e., if that
vintage of permits is used for that quarter’s compliance obligation). Only the cheapest
permits are used since permits are perfect substitutes. All prices grow at the rate of
interest as required by the arbitrage condition.
Panel A of Fig. 5 illustrates perhaps the most common market design: banking
without borrowing as in ARP, CAIR, and CSAPR. To illustrate the design, we show
three vintages of permits with equal allocations. Vintage A permits are allocated for year
1 so are valid for all four quarters of year 1, and—since they can be banked—are also

valid in years 2 and 3, i.e., & X = & X` = & Xi = 1. Since Vintage A permits are valid in

all three years, the price is illustrated for all three years. Similarly, Vintage B permits can
be used in years 2 and 3, i.e., & Z = 0 and & Z` = & Zi = 1, and Vintage C permits can

only be used in year 3, i.e., & j = & j` = 0 and & ji = 1. Since Vintage A permits can

be used in every quarter where Vintage B permits can be used, their price must be higher.

Similarly, Vintage B permits are more valuable than Vintage C permits. Thus X ≥

Z ≥ j for every .

51

Although equilibrium prices are defined for all quarters—since prices grow at the rate of interest—we
simply illustrate the prices that are relevant for the abatement decision in each quarter.

29

To develop the intuition of the equilibrium, first consider the equilibrium if the
permits could not be banked or borrowed. Since permit price grows at the rate of interest
within each year, abatement is delayed within the year. However, abatement cannot be
delayed across years. In fact, since permit allocations are equal and abatement costs are
stationary, the marginal abatement costs and equilibrium permit prices must be equal
across years, i.e., X = Z8k = j8l .

Now consider what happens when the permits can be banked. The firm now

could use Vintage A permits in year 2, but it would not, since their price is higher. Thus,
the equilibrium with banking, illustrated in Panel A, is identical to the equilibrium
without banking: abatement is delayed within each year; each vintage of permits is used
exclusively in its allocation year; and no permits are banked.52
Panel B of Fig. 5 shows an alternative market design where permits can be freely
borrowed but not banked. This is similar to the three-year borrowing allowed in RGGI
and AB 32.53 Now all three vintages can be used in the first year since Vintages B & C

can be borrowed. Thus Vintage C permits are the most valuable and X ≤ Z ≤ j for

all . Allowing borrowing does change the equilibrium since firm would like to borrow

permits and delay abatement further. In equilibrium, borrowing drives down the price of
Vintage A permits, but increases the price of Vintage C as illustrated in Panel B. Thus
abatement is delayed across years; permits are borrowed; and the permit prices for all
vintages are equal.54
Panel C shows a market design adopted by the RECLAIM program in southern

California. The model has overlapping permit vintages each of which is valid for four
quarters, with new permits being issued and old permits expiring every two quarters.
This equilibrium is quite similar to the equilibrium with banking since each vintage of
permits is exhausted before their expiration date when new permits become valid. Here,
the more frequent allocation of permits leads to less delayed abatement within a year.
Panel D illustrates a feature introduced by the Waxman-Markey proposal. Under
the proposal, the permits can be freely banked as in Panel A. However, the permits can
52

Since there are no abatement cost shocks and the supply of permits is not decreasing, there is no reason
to bank permits for the future.
53
RGGI and AB 32 also allow banking. However, banking does not occur in this simple equilibrium.
54
This equilibrium with borrowing is equivalent to the equilibrium with banking and borrowing.

30

also be borrowed, but at a cost: an 8% quantity-based penalty is imposed on each permit
for each year it is used before its allocation date.55 Thus the “effective price” of a
Vintage B permit is higher if it is used in year 1 rather than in year 2. These effective
prices are illustrated in Panel D. As illustrated, the borrowing penalty is sufficient that no
permits are borrowed in equilibrium. However, if the borrowing penalty were less severe
(or if there were adverse abatement cost shocks) firms might borrow permits in
equilibrium even though borrowing is costly.

4.2 Spatial permit restrictions
To illustrate spatial validity in permit design, consider two facilities with different

(constant) marginal damages, m < m` and abatement costs

( )

and

` ( ` ).

Marginal

abatement costs, damages, and efficient emissions are illustrated in Fig. 6. We illustrate
how this efficient allocation can be implemented with two different spatial restrictions on
permit validity.
We first illustrate zonal validity of two vintages of permits. This example is
similar to the RECLAIM program where inland facilities can use either coastal or inland
permits, but coastal facilities can only use coastal permits. Define two spatial vintages of
permits: A and B. The low damage facility (Facility 1) can use either vintage of permits
whereas the high damage facility (Facility 2) can only use the vintage B permits. Since
vintage B permits can be used by either facility, they are more valuable and X ≤ Z .

The spatial restrictions are then &X = &Z = 1, &`X = 0, and &`Z = 1.

To implement the efficient allocation in Fig. 6 with this market design, the

regulator simply chooses the caps such that \X =



and \Z =

`.

With these caps, the

two vintages are segregated in equilibrium with X = m < m` = Z , and emissions are at

the efficient levels. Facility 2 would like to use the vintage A permits but cannot due to

the spatial restriction. Facility 1 is allowed to use the vintage B permits but chooses not
to since they are more expensive.
Next consider implementing the equilibrium with one spatial vintage of permits
(vintage C) but different permits-to-emissions compliance ratios for the two facilities.
Using our notation, & X = & X` = & Xi = 1; n Z = 1/1.08 = 0.93 and & Z` = & Zi = 1; and & j =
0.86, & j` = 0.93, and & ji = 1.
55

31

The regulator now chooses the compliance ratios: &j and &`j , and the cap: \j , to

implement the efficient allocation in Fig. 6.56
\j =

If the regulator sets compliance ratios &j = 1 and &`j = m /m` < 1 and the cap



+

` /&`j ,

then the equilibrium price is j = m . Facility 1 then sets its marginal

abatement cost equal to j /&j = j = m , and Facility 2 sets its marginal abatement
cost equal to j /&`j = m` m /m` = m`. Since Facility 1 demands

demands

` /&`j



permits and facility 2

permits, the equilibrium implements the efficient emissions levels.

These two market designs each implement the efficient spatial distribution of
emissions with different mechanisms and are equivalent in this simple model. However,
they would not be equivalent with abatement cost shocks. For example, if Facility 1
suffered an adverse abatement cost shock, the zonal design would require that only

Facility 1 adjusts, i.e., only X increases, unless the abatement cost were so extreme that

X were driven above m` , at which point X = Z and both facilities would reduce

emissions. On the contrary, with different permits-to-emissions compliance ratios, even a
small abatement cost shock to Facility 1 causes j to increase which causes both

facilities to reduce emissions. Which market design is more efficient depends on the
relative slopes of marginal abatement costs and marginal damages. 57

5. Conclusion
Market mechanisms, primarily cap and trade programs, continue to be one of the
primary tools for reducing harmful emissions. To address a variety of technical and
political constraints, existing and proposed programs take a variety of approaches to
permit validity and compliance timing. We review these approaches for nine major cap
and trade programs. ARP defined the classic program design, and several of its features
have been widely adopted: annual permits with banking but no borrowing, 1:1 permitsto-emissions compliance ratios, quarterly reporting, and annual compliance. However, as
shown in Section 2, other programs depart in significant ways from the design of the
56

The differential permits-to-emissions compliance ratios in CAIR and ARP are similar to this market
design. Under CAIR, SO2 permit allocations in the eastern United States have a 2:1 compliance ratio for
2010 to 2014, increasing to 2.86:1 after 2014. SO2 permits under ARP continue to cover emissions at a 1:1
rate outside the designated eastern states.
57
A more complete analysis of optimal spatial design with asymmetric information is beyond the scope of
this paper.

32

ARP. One significant departure, adopted by RGGI and AB32, is the three-year
compliance window. Other departures impose different compliance ratios, restricted
forms of borrowing, or restricted forms of banking. Despite this considerable
heterogeneity, there has been little systematic study of these key features of program
design.
Our model of permit market design provides a general analysis of permit validity
and compliance timing. The first result shows that equilibrium abatement is invariant to
compliance timing if a simple arbitrage condition holds. If abatement is invariant to
compliance timing, delayed compliance cannot smooth adverse cost shocks. In
particular, delayed compliance does nothing to help regulated facilities respond to
adverse shocks, for example, from high electricity demand due to adverse weather, from
fuel price spikes, or from clean generator outages.
Despite the invariance results, our second and third results suggest caution in
adopting delayed compliance due to the increased variance of compliance costs and to
non-unique or degenerate prices. With delayed compliance, compliance obligations are
settled at the expected price plus noise. Thus the variance of compliance costs increases
with delayed compliance. Furthermore, there may be no elasticity in the supply of or
demand for permits at the time of compliance, and hence any price could clear the
market. Which prices form the equilibrium price distribution is determined by both
future abatement cost shocks and the arbitrage condition. Degenerate prices are those
determined by the arbitrage condition rather than abatement costs, i.e., degenerate prices
are prices that ex post justify the ex ante expectation. These degenerate prices, which
would likely not be discovered by a Walrasian tâtonnement process, are irrelevant with
prompt compliance but govern transactions with delayed compliance.
Although the invariance results are quite general, there are some program designs
which do not satisfy the sufficient conditions of the results. In particular, delayed
allocations or a price cap supported by a reserve fund can lead to abatement that depends
on compliance timing.
The equilibrium of the model is illustrated using several specific features of
temporal and spatial permit validity. These features include banking, borrowing,
borrowing with interest, spatial segmentation, and permits-to-emissions compliance

33

ratios. The illustrations demonstrate the model’s broad applicability to market designs in
practice.
The increasing heterogeneity in program design requires careful study of different
aspects of the programs. Our model and analysis present a framework for analyzing
permit validity and compliance timing. The invariance results show that compliance
timing cannot smooth abatement cost shocks for a broad class of models. In these cases,
moreover, delayed compliance increases the variance of compliance costs and can imply
non-unique or degenerate equilibrium prices. Finally, several other factors would also
be assessed when considering prompt versus delayed compliance. These include effects
on program administration (administrative costs, smoothing the flow of administrative
work, developing/maintaining staff expertise, prompt resolution of disputes and data
errors, and maintaining the credibility of the program) and market performance
(improving permit supply information, increasing the salience of compliance costs, and
avoiding complications from bankruptcy). These factors seem to favor prompt
compliance, and they can be considered along with our results when designing cap and
trade programs.

the two terms is zero since xyz(f, w) = 0 implies that 'n{(f + w) = 'n{(f) +

'n{(w).

w = 0 follows directly since:

where the first equality follows from the expectation operator and the second equality

  % .

Since w = 0, it follows that xyz(f, w) = fw. Since f and w are both sums,

their product contains many terms. Letting ′ and ′ index the term from f, and letting 

and  index the term from w, the expectation of each term of the product is

The model without uncertainty
This appendix presents the main model presented in Section 3 without the
abatement costs shocks. This simplifies the analysis significantly by allowing
Lagrangian techniques instead of dynamic programming. The presentation here also
focuses more carefully on deriving demands for the permits and characterizing the
competitive equilibrium. All results from the more general model in Section 3 hold. All
notation is as defined in Section 3 with the exception that
function which is not subject to shocks.

The objective in [10] minimizes the sum of abatement costs and permit costs subject to
the compliance constraint in [11]. There are several things to note about the
optimization. First, the abatement costs are incurred at the time the emissions take place.
We assume (quite reasonably!) that after the pollution is emitted, there is no way for the
facility to reduce its past emissions. Thus the relevant discount factor for abatement costs
is 7  . Second, the relevant price of the permits is the price at the time of compliance,
4. () . Even if the facility purchases the permits earlier (as would be prudent), the

relevant cost is the opportunity cost at the time of compliance. Thus the relevant discount
factor for compliance costs is 7 4. () . Third, the time of compliance may differ across

facilities. Finally, a facility is in compliance if emissions in period  are less than the
permits (weighted by compliance factors) summed over all .

Assuming the constraint binds with equality, the Kuhn-Tucker first order and

complementary slackness (C.S.) conditions for the facility’s cost minimization are then:
$  ≥ 0

if emissions are positive. The condition in [13] states that marginal abatement costs in
each period should be equal (in present value) to the minimum weighted price of all the
vintages that are valid for period .58

The cost minimization problem takes prices as given. Equilibrium prices will

equate supply and demand in every period. Let ̅ be the vector of all time dated prices

for all permit vintages. The cost minimization defines a demand correspondence for each
vintage of permit. Let   (̅) be firm ’s demand correspondence for permit vintage .

Since permits of different vintages are perfect substitutes,   (̅ ) will generally not be a

function. Clearly,   (̅ ) = ∑
 $  , i.e., facility i’s demand for each permit vintage is

the sum over the demands for all the periods the vintage is valid. Since market demand is
found by adding up demands from each facility, and since permit supply is perfectly
inelastic, market demand equals supply for permit vintage  if:
3   (̅ ) =  .

(13)

Describing the market demand and supply for permits would normally
characterize the competitive equilibrium. However, prices are time dated, so there are
more prices than markets. Since permits are costless to store, arbitrage will force the

permit prices to be equal in present value, i.e., to grow at the rate of interest. Let ) be

this common present value, i.e.,) ≡ 7   for every , which characterizes the arbitrage
condition. This condition reduces the dimensionality of the price vector to the dimension

of the number of markets, and the equilibrium is now completely characterized.
Using the arbitrage condition, equation [13] can now be written

or equivalently
As in Section 3, [4] can be derived by noting that [1] is linear in the $  controls. The optimal solution is
then a corner solution at the minimum of the prices. After substitution of the binding constraint, [4] is the

Note that [16], which implies that the facility sets the marginal abatement cost in

period  equal to the cheapest valid permit in period , is equivalent to [7] in Section 3.

Thus the current permit prices contain all the relevant information for the facility to make
its abatement cost decisions.
