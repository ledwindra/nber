    "abstract": "\n\nGermany has experienced a high and rising rate of anti-foreigner violence during the early 1990s.  To analyze the determinants of crime against foreigners we assembled a new data set on the number and nature of such crimes at the county level based on newspaper reports. We find significant differences in the patterns of violence in the eastern and western parts of the country.  The incidence of anti- foreigner crime is higher in the east and rises with distance from the former west German border.  Economic variables like unemployment and wages matter little for the level of crime once location in the east is taken into account.  The relative number of foreigners in a country has no relationship with the incidence of ethnic crimes in the west, whereas in the east it has a positive association with the number of crimes per resident and a negative association with the number of crimes per foreign resident.\n\n",
