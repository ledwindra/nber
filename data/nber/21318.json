    "abstract": "\n\nWe document a change in household shopping behavior during the Great Recession. Households purchased more on sale, larger sizes and generic products, increased coupon usage, and shopping at discount stores. We estimate that the returns to these shopping activities declined during the recession and therefore this behavior implies a signi\ufb01cant decrease in households\u2019 opportunity cost of time. Using the estimated cost of time and time use data, we estimate a high elasticity of substitution between market expenditure and time spent on non-market work. We \ufb01nd that households smooth a sizable fraction of consumption by varying their time allocation during recessions.\n\n",
