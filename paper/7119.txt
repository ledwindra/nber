There is a lot of talk about reforming old age Social Security (hereafter SS). Two important questions
come to mind. First, is reforming SS desirable? That is, will the reform improve welfare for a significant number
of people? Answering this question is impossible without a positive theory of the creation and evolution of SS.
For example, if we evaluate various reform proposals under the belief that SS plays a certain role (say, if we think
that SS was created to make sure that the young “save enough” for their elder years), but in reality, SS plays
another role (say, it was created to induce the elderly to retire so their jobs could be given to more productive
young workers), then we may end up adopting the wrong reform: one which maximizes the rate of return, but
keeps the elderly working! Since any reform evaluation implicitly assumes a positive theory of SS, our task in
this paper and a companion paper is to be explicit about the facts and about the implications of various positive
theories.
The second question in evaluating reform is whether it is sustainable. Are the most popular proposals
sustainable? In particular, is a “fully funded” system sustainable? Is an “individual accounts” system
sustainable? An important reason to question the sustainability of fully funded reforms is that no SS program
in history has been fully funded for any important length of time.1 At the same time there are several SS
programs which were supposed to be fully funded, but were unfunded by the political system in short order.
Take, for example, Chile’s original SS program (Edwards 1998, p. 37), Germany’s original program (BörschSupan and Schnabel 1997, p. 7), one of the original French programs, the first U.S. SS law (passed in 1935,
scheduled to come into effect in 1937 and to be partially funded, but rescinded in 1939; Miron and Weil 1997
p. 5), and Sweden’s first system (Palme and Svensson 1997, p. 11). A number of individual accounts systems
have also failed to be politically sustainable, including those in Seychelles and Egypt (Gruat 1990, p. 416) and
St. Vincent (Haanes-Olsen 1989, p. 19), the system for the American clergy (Mulligan 1997), and some African
(Gruat 1990, p. 408) and Caribbean (Jenkins 1981, p. 633) Provident Funds.
To answer the question of whether reforms are sustainable, we also need to have a positive theory of SS.
A good theory of SS, therefore, needs to explain not only why SS exists, but also what are the social, economic,
and political forces that create these programs, keep them in place and allow them to grow.
The main purpose of this paper and a companion paper (Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin 1999b) is to identify
such a positive theory or theories of SS. The companion paper documents a number of "facts" about SS programs

1

For our purposes, a fully funded system is one which delivers a rate of return greater than the growth
of labor income without taxing that income at higher and higher rates. This definition rules out, for example,
systems like Singapore's "Provident fund" which appears to be a fully funded system but in fact delivers rates
of return to contributors of no more than the rate of labor income growth.

around the world and about government spending on the elderly in general. We suggest there that SS theories
can be grouped into three categories: Political, Efficiency and Narrative theories, and derive implications of the
political theories.
In the first section of this paper we derive implications of efficiency theories of SS. In section II we
discuss four narrative theories. Section III derives some implications for reform in the light of each of the
efficiency and political theories. Perhaps surprisingly, those theories most consistent with the empirical
regularities are those in which forced savings is a rather undesirable policy, even in the long run.
For convenience, we reproduce here the summary Table 2 displayed in the companion paper. This Table
is a useful guide to comparing various efficiency theories. We refer readers to the companion paper's Table 1
for an analysis of some of the common implications of efficiency theories, and how they compare with those of
the political theories.

I. Efficiency Theories of Social Security Compared
The efficiency theories of Social Security identify some market inefficiency and argue that SS is a way
to regain optimality by alleviating this inefficiency. We put eight theories in this category: optimal redistribution
or risk sharing, human capital spillovers, optimal retirement insurance, prodigal father problem, Keynesian
savings extraction, optimal longevity insurance, return on human capital investment, and administrative of scale
4

I.D. Social Security as Solution to the Prodigal Father Problem
A widespread theory is that SS takes care of the elderly because some of them engaged in prodigal
behavior when they were young and did not save enough to support themselves later in life. There are two
versions of this theory.

I.D.1. Myopic Prodigality
The first version assumes that parents were not looking forward enough when they were young.
According to this version, people make “mistakes” when they are young and they save too little. Diamond (1977)
suggests several possible “reasons” for this: (i) people may lack the information necessary to judge their needs
in retirement; (ii) people may be unable to make effective decisions about long-term issues because they are not
willing to confront the fact that one day they will be old; and (iii) they may simply fail to give sufficient weight
to the future when making decisions so, in essence, they may act “myopically”. As a result, it may be desirable
for the government to act paternalistically and force citizens to save the appropriate amount.13
Diamond (1977) suggests that the solution to the prodigal father problem is a fully funded program, and
one that need not be administered by the government. We believe that the solution may involve a pay-as-you-go
program since, when the program is first created, it is too late to force the first old generation to save and
(presuming society still wants to help the poor old) revenue is immediately needed to pay them. However, this
reasoning cannot explain why even the richer members of the initial old generation would receive subsidies.14
As a forced savings program, it may explain why benefits are not means-tested - the program is not designed to
redistribute, just to ensure people leave some of their resources for their old age. Feldstein (1985) suggests that,
as opposed to the SS programs used in practice, the optimal solution to the prodigal father problem involves
means-testing and a low level of retirement benefits.
Any efficiency consideration which is solved by a forced savings plan would, assuming the forced
savings plan is the solution chosen by the public sector, predict a relationship between benefit per elderly and the
fraction elderly only to the extent that the rate of return to savings falls with the stock of capital. Hence we note
in Table 2 that the prodigal father theory is consistent with a lack of relationship between the share of the
population over age 65 and benefits per elderly.

13

Other proponents of the first version include Feldstein (1985). Bodie and Merton (1992) refer to
the second version of the prodigal father problem as the “free-rider” problem.
14

In other words, the solution to the prodigal father problem should either be fully funded (with no
payments to the initially old generation) or payments to the initially old should be means tested.
18

I.D.2. Rational Prodigality
The second version of the theory seems to be exactly the opposite: parents were forward looking to such
an extent when they were young that they anticipated not only their needs for retirement, but how their children
and others in society would react to those needs (eg., Laitner 1988). In particular, they expect society to aid them
in desperate situations (eg., poverty) even when those situations are self-induced. For example, society may feel
it intolerable to have destitute elderly citizens around. Realizing this, some younger people may not bother to
save for their old age, knowing they will be “bailed out”.15 The result is less than Pareto optimal because the
prodigal young are not equating their willingness to delay consumption to the social marginal rate of
transformation (ie, to the interest rate).
One way to solve the time inconsistency problem and achieve a Pareto optimal allocation is to force
citizens to save when they are young and give them the resources back when they are old, a scheme whose steady
state would look something like Social Security with resources being taken from the young and payments being
made to the old.

In both versions of the prodigal father problem, the young are against the adoption of a forced savings
program. In the first version, the young have their own (short-sighted) way of doing things - and it doesn’t
involve saving for retirement. In the second version, a forced savings program hurts the initial young and helps
the unborn because prodigality is the way the young steal from the unborn (even though the former benefit from
the prodigality less than it costs the latter). Since the initial old presumably do not care whether the young are
forced to save for their old age, forced savings would face a lot of political opposition; neither prodigal father
model can explain why forced savings would be the outcome of political processes and why they would not
abolished.
There is another solution to the rational prodigal father problem which is both efficient and Pareto
improving upon no program. It is the forced savings program above plus a transfer from the unborn to the initial
young. The sum of these two would be a pay-as-you go system, with an initial generation receiving more in
(present value) benefits than it paid in taxes in order to compensate it for giving up its prodigality. Later
generations are willing to give up their prodigality because they don't have to finance the prodigality of earlier
generations. Hence, the two prodigal father models predict that SS is largely unfunded. It also explains why fully

15

The young would anticipate being bailed out even if the government and family members insist they
will not to help any elderly who engaged in prodigal behavior, because such claims fail to be credible when
made by those who care about the welfare of the elderly.
19

funded systems are often unfunded by the political process.16
Finally, none of the versions of the prodigal father model explain why SS induces retirement while at the
same time not means-testing benefits.

I.E. Misguided Keynesian
Thomas Sargent (in Feldstein 1998, p. 306) suggests that SS was created to purposefully reduce national
savings in a moment in which aggregate demand was low (the Great Depression) and, following the Keynesian
prescription, consumption needed to be stimulated. The point is based on the belief that SS programs tend to
reduce national savings (see, for example, Feldstein 1998). This theory is consistent with the fact that SS is
usually run by the government. Keynesianism also explains why proof of disability is not required.
If the Keynesian explanation is modified by assuming that policy-makers are wrong to believe in
Keynesianism (as Sargent 1998 suggests), then forced savings can improve welfare in the long run.
If life expectancy grew or workers increased their demand for early retirement, the Keynesian
policymaker might decrease the government retirement age in order to counteract the corresponding increase in
private savings. This is a prediction consistent with real world SS policy and, as we show above, one that few
(if any) other theories can explain.
Unlike many of the efficiency models, redistribution from young to old is efficiency enhancing (because
it reduces savings) in the Keynesian analysis. We have therefore entered as a footnote in Table 1 that the
Keynesian model is consistent with cross-cohort redistribution.
On the adverse side, this theory encounters problems in explaining the strong retirement incentives
generated by SS (which, presumably, tend to increase savings, Feldstein 1974). Nor can discouraging savings
explain why so many countries give special treatment to retirement savings or why some SS programs began as
funded systems (such as Chile’s original SS program, Germany’s original program, one of the original French
programs, the first U.S. SS law passed in 1935 and Sweden’s first system). In addition, this theory offers no
explanation as to why benefits are not means tested, why SS is financed with payroll taxes rather than with the
regular budget.
Can the misguided Keynesian model explain the positive correlation between economic growth and the

16

There are two ways to modify the model to predict a funded system. One is to allow there to be two
types of young: one prodigal and the other saving for retirement and expected to aid the prodigal type. In this
case, the second type delivers the political support for the forced savings (this is the model of Mulligan and
Philipson 1999). Another modification is to replace short-sightedness by the young with a self-recognized
lack of self-control (we owe this point to David Laibson).
20

size of SS? If the causality is to be from economic growth to SS, it seems the answer must be “no”. Why would
the Keynesian policy-maker in a rapidly growing economy be the most intent on discouraging savings? Perhaps
the causality is the other way around - Keynesian policy makers help their economies grow by discouraging
savings? This may be the case, but is inconsistent with Sargent’s version of the story in which Keynesianism is
misguided (ie, the policy makers believe that savings is bad for growth when in fact it is not).

I.F. Social Security as Longevity Insurance
This argument concerns uncertainty about the length of life. In few other personal decisions can
uncertainty play a greater role. Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) suggest that risk averse older individuals might be
willing to give up as much as one half of their resources in order to gain access to an actuarially fair annuity. In
principle, the existence of uncertainty does not imply that government intervention is essential. The capital
market may offer appropriate instruments (private annuities). However, if individuals have substantial private
information about their health (and, therefore, their mortality), a private annuities market will encounter adverse
selection problems. Hamermesh (1987) suggests that this explains why government run mandatory SS programs
are efficiency enhancing: participation in an annuities market must be compulsory (if there are to be annuities at
all) because individuals have private information about their mortality.
Obviously this theory can explain why the SS is run by the government and why it is mandatory. The
theory is also consistent with the fact that benefits are increasing function of lifetime earnings, the fact that they
are usually paid as annuities, or that proof of disability is usually not required (since the program has nothing to
do with disabilities).
The theory has problems explaining why governments are so heavily involved in longevity insurance but
not other forms of insurance. Moreover, if SS were solving adverse selection problems in private sector insurance
markets, why do governments so often give citizens choices about when to retire and start taking the annuity?
Some governments even allow citizens to opt out of the annuity and take lump sums upon retirement! We also
mention in Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1999b, Section I.U) that there is little evidence for adverse selection in
private life insurance and annuities markets.
Most importantly, this theory does not explain why SS induces retirement. It is interesting that implicit
taxes on the elderly are an even more prevalent feature of SS than is it’s annuity feature. Examples of countries
inducing retirement but not requiring full annuitization are Bahrain, Egypt, and Mexico’s new system (U.S. SSA
Programs 1995).
Since the longevity insurance model does not predict induced retirement, the government retirement age
in the model is 4 (here we think of the government retirement age as the age where retirement inducements begin).
21

Hence, the theory does not offer predictions for changes over time in the government retirement age.

I.G. Government Economizes on Administration Costs
Diamond (1993) and others have suggested that SS serves the purpose of private pension plans, but is
administered by the government because the government enjoys the greatest economies of scale in administration
costs. So, like private pension benefits, SS benefits are earnings tested,17 not asset tested, increasing in lifetime
contributions, and are paid to emigrants and the institutionalized. And like private pension plans, retirement ages
have not risen over time.
Diamond’s hypothesis implies that the reduced administration costs outweigh costs of the “one-size-fitsall” rules (eg., same retirement age) which permit the reduction in administration costs. One crucial implication
of this theory is therefore whether in fact government administered plans have lower administrative costs. We
point out in Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1999b, section I) that a substantial quantity of American private pension
money is subject to less administration costs than those of SSA, although perhaps those private pensions are not
representative of the pensions administered by the government.
Even if private pension managers would administer pensions for the entire labor force in a more costly
way than SSA, it does not follow that government administration is preferable. As long as workers are rational
and private pension management is a competitive market, the cost argument for government administration
requires that private pension managers cannot administer pensions for the entire labor force as cheaply as SSA.
Revealed preference says that workers are better off under private pension systems for which the low SSA costs
are feasible, even though they system may in fact incur greater costs. The reason pension managers would choose
a more costly administrative method is in response to their customer's demands to do things in a more costly way.
Furthermore, the theory cannot explain why SS is mandatory or why SS redistributes across cohorts.
Nor can Diamond’s hypothesis explain why governments do not impose one-size-fits-all in so many other markets
such as automobiles, breakfast cereal, or personal computers.

I.H. Return on Human Capital Investment
Payroll taxes typically provide the vast majority of revenue for SS expenditures. It seems that the old
generation has a stake in the earning power of the working age generation: the more the workers earn, the more
revenue obtained from taxing payroll at a given rate, and the more revenue available for subsidizing the old.

17

To be complete, it needs to be explained why private pensions encourage retirement. See Lazear
(1979) for one attempt to do so.
22

Based on this observation, it has been suggested (eg., Pogue and Sgontz 1977, Becker and Murphy 1988) that
Social Security is nothing more than a dividend paid to the old for human capital investments they made when
the current workers were of schooling age. And these observers have pointed out that governments are also
involved in educational investments - investments which have grown over time together with public pensions.
We formalize this view of Social Security, derive some implications of it, and compare those implications
to the facts about Social Security. Each generation lives three periods in our illustrative model. Time is indexed
t = 1,2,3,.... Generations are indexed t = -1, 0, 1, 2, ... according to the time period in which they lived the first
third of their life. Generation t has Pt members. Human capital investments are made during the first period of
life (“youth”). Wage income of a generation t worker is wt during the middle period. For simplicity, we assume
that people work only in the middle period of life.
Each generation t invests in the human capital of generation t+1, owning an *t interest, for all t $ 0.
"Dividends" on this investment are *twt+1Pt+1, and the government forces the young to pay the dividend to the old.
Let "t denote the fraction of generation t's labor income made as an investment in generation t+1's human capital,
so the aggregate investment by generation t is "twtPt. The dividend rate *t depends on the amount invested, the
relative cohort size, and other variables according to the technology for human capital investment.
With the exception of generation 0, each working generation provides two sources of funds to the system:
a labor income tax at rate *t to pay the dividends to earlier investors and funds for investment in the next
generation. If the funds for investment were obtained as a tax (there may or not be a reason in this model why
participation in the system would be compulsory - see below) then the two payments by generation t workers
might be merged into a single labor income tax payment at rate Jt:

J0 ' "0
Jt ' "t % *t&1 , t > 0

Notice that the initial working generation did not enjoy investments made by the previous generation and hence
pay only investment funds at rate "0 into the system. Hence tax rates are lowest for the initial working generation
(as long as " is not falling too rapidly over time), although Jt > 0. If the system were terminated, tax rates would
also be low for the final generation because they have only to pay back the previous generation but not to invest
in the next.
Presumably, the claim by Pogue, Sgontz, Becker, and Murphy that SS is a vehicle for human capital
investment, does not preclude the use of an individual accounts system. In other words, the system could be run
23

by giving any individual member of generation t a share of the old age dividends *twt+1P t+1 according to the
amount he contributed during his working years toward investments in the young. The rate of return on those
contributions is:

r tss ' ln

*t wt %1 Pt%1
"t wt Pt

We believe it is worthwhile to distinguish two versions of the human capital model of SS, even though only one
has been discussed in the literature. The first assumes rtss $ r, for all t where r is a market rate of return of on
investments of similar risk. The second assumes rtss < r.
In an individual accounts system with rtss $ r, contributions "twtPt to the system could be voluntary.
However, payment of dividends *twt+1Pt+1 may have to be compulsory (ie, the young may need to be forced to
keep their repayment promise). Hence, the first version of the human capital model of SS explains why at least
some “contribution” to the SS program is compulsory.
Since rtss $ r for all t, all generations benefit from SS and it would not be said that SS redistributes across
cohorts. Of course, government expenditures on education must, according to the human capital model of SS,
be taken into account when it is determined whether SS redistributes across cohorts. The “generational
accounting” by Kotlikoff (1992) and followers take educational spending (and other government spending) into
account and show how governments have redistributed from young to old cohorts. Hence, the first version of the
human capital model of SS is inconsistent with the vast amount of intergenerational redistribution by government.
The second version has rtss < r for some t (especially large t) so contributions "twtPt to the system must
be compulsory. If they were voluntary, no worker would contribute because other investments offer better rates
of return. If rtss < r because too many subsidies were paid to the initial old, then it would be said that SS
redistributes across cohorts. Hence, the second version of the human capital model of SS explains compulsory
SS and is consistent with SS’s redistributing across cohorts. However, it does not explain why the redistribution
is from young to old rather from old to young or between other groups. The system is efficiency reducing in the
case rtss < r, so it needs to be explained why the system exists at all.
Since both versions of the model view old age pensions as a return on investment, neither explain why
retirement is required to receive those returns. After all, companies pay dividends and interest - and even
governments pay interest and principal on their bonds - without inquiring as to the labor market status of the
equity- or bond-holder.

24

II. Narrative Theories
Some theories of SS have been frequently discussed, but not analyzed systematically in the literature.
Since there are not mathematical models in the literature for us to derive implications, and the narrative theories
are not obviously “political” or “efficiency”, we analyze those theories separately here and do not enter any
implications in either Table 1 or Table 2 of this and the companion paper. We entitle the narrative theories:
“Chain Letter,” “Lump of Labor,” “Monopoly Capitalism,” and “Nearly rational policy”. We hope our
discussion of one or more of the narrative theories might intrigue a reader enough for him to develop a systematic
mathematical analysis of it.

II.A. Social Security as Chain Letter
Some people argue that SS is like a Ponzi-type chain letter, by which the first generation of elderly takes
a pension T from the young, and “promises” that the future generations will pay the money back with some
positive rate of return (Friedman 1972, Romer 1994): each generation believes that it is a good idea to pay SS
taxes because, by continuing the chain letter, later generations will pay even more taxes to fund benefits. There
are two versions of the chain letter model, one narrative and the other from the literature on “dynamic
inefficiency.”
To see how this would work, consider first the case when the rate of return to private capital investment
is r > 0 and there is no growth. The first generation of elderly gets a lump sum pension T > 0 which is financed,
say, with a lump sum tax on the currently young. The “plan” is that each subsequent generation will receive a
pension of the same size when old, financed with lump sum taxes on the existing young. Obviously the first
generation of elderly wins T since they do not pay any taxes. The second and all subsequent generations will lose
rT (which is the opportunity cost of not investing the taxes in the real market, which yields a rate of return r).
Note that the present value of all these losses from now to infinity is equal to (rT)/r=T. In other words, the gains
for the first generation are paid by the losses of all future generations. Notice that, because the first young will
not buy this proposal, SS will never get started under these conditions.
In order to make it a “good deal” for the initially young, the initially old would have to “promise” a rate
of return larger than r. Let us call this rate of return rss > r. Since the economy does not grow, this can only be
achieved by taxing the future young a larger fraction of their income. Obviously, this promise cannot be made
ad infinitum because there will be a generation for which the SS taxes will be larger than their entire income.
Hence, with probability one there will be a generation that will stop contributing to this pyramid and the
generation before that will suffer heavy losses. Backward induction suggests that rational agents will not start
playing this Ponzi game so the theory needs to be completed with some assumption of irrational expectations (or
25

perhaps expectations of irrational expectations). Even though we made the argument under the assumption that
the growth rate of the economy is zero, it should be clear that the need to raise taxes continuously (and, therefore,
the necessity for the chain letter to eventually collapse) would apply if the growth rate, (, is smaller than the
interest rate, r.18 In other words, Ponzi games of this sort would not arise in dynamically efficient rational
expectation economies.
One problem with this theory is that it fails to explain why private-sector chain letters are so much less
successful than SS. Another problem is that it does not explain why retirement is induced by the SS system.
Finally, these theories face a theoretical problem of enforcement: why do the young believe that the Ponzi Scheme
will still be in place when they become old? Sure, the current elderly “promise” that it will be in place, but how
can they commit the future young to play the game (especially given that the future young are not even born yet!).
A second version of the “chain letter” theory points to a literature showing how dynamic models of
savings and investment need not guarantee that the no-government competitive equilibrium is dynamically
efficient. For example, the overlapping generation model of Diamond (1965) show that the competitive
equilibrium may entail “excessive” capital accumulation. When this inefficiency occurs, the real interest rate is
less than the aggregate growth rate of the economy (which is the sum of the rates of population growth and
technological progress). Under these circumstances, the introduction of a public PAYG pension scheme can be
seen as an instrument unanimously beneficial. A private pension scheme delivers a rate of return equal to the
interest rate, r. If we let the growth rate of the economy be given by (, then the implicit rate of return of a PAYG
public SS is (. If the economy is in the dynamically inefficient region, then ( > r so a PAYG SS system delivers
a superior rate of return. Samuelson (1958) shows that a SS system of this type can lead the economy to the
golden rule steady state19.
A central question is not whether dynamic inefficiency is theoretically possible but whether it is
empirically relevant. Since we observe that SS programs have been created all over the world throughout the XX
century, one would have to show that dynamic inefficiency is pervasive.
Not only do both versions of the chain letter theory fail to explain why SS induces retirement or why SS

18

This differs from the political model of Browning (1975) discussed in section I.A, where SS could
be implemented with the votes of the old and the middle aged, even if it was promised that the SS program
would grow at a rate less than r (in which case, the young would lose from SS but would be outvoted in an
election).
19

In essence, the literature of SS as a chain letter parallels the literature on rational bubbles. Tirole
(1982) shows how rational bubbles cannot exist in infinite horizon models (which deliver dynamically
efficient solutions) and Tirole (1985) shows that they may arise in OLG models with dynamically inefficient
solutions.
26

is financed with payroll taxes, but these two important facts are excluded from the calculus of the model. To see
this, notice that the present value calculations above assume that the old value at T a pension in the amount T.
If the taxes and transfers were not lump sum, then there would be distortions which need to be taken into account
in the computations of the rates or return. One of the basic results from public finance is that those subsidized
typically value their subsidy less than the subsidy costs because they change their behavior in order receive to
the subsidy or in order to receive a larger one. Since some of the elderly are retiring earlier than they would in
the absence of SS, the average valuation by the elderly of a pension in the amount T is less than T, with the
difference being the “deadweight cost” of the subsidy. The opposite is the case for the young: rather than valuing
their tax dollars T in the amount T, they value it at more than T because they change their behavior in order to
avoid additional taxes. Given that the SS chain letter has distortionary tax and benefit formulas, participation
in the chain letter only makes sense if rss is enough greater than r to justify the deadweight costs of the taxes and
subsidies.

II.B. Lump of Labor
A popular European theory of SS argues that jobs need to be redistributed from the old to the young in
a world where there is a lot of unemployment. The story may run as follows: suppose that there is involuntary
unemployment (due to some imperfection in the labor market, or to excessive regulation, or to the existence of
powerful unions, etc.). The government may wish to take some of the jobs currently done by citizens of “near
retirement age” in exchange for a SS pension, and give them to the young.
There are several versions of this idea. One of them is that, because the young are more productive, it
is better from an aggregate point of view that the young have these jobs and this is why this policy may be
desirable (this argument is similar to Sala-i-Martin’s (1996) efficiency theory of SS). Another version would
argue that the government may want to follow this policy because high unemployment is politically less
acceptable than a high number of “early retirees” (in fact, economic statistics do not count the retired as
unemployed, even though they do not work). A third version of this story would say that unions favor this policy
because the fundamental difference between a young unemployed and a retired old is that the unemployed person
“searches” for jobs and, as a results, contributes to downward wage pressure.
Obviously this story is consistent with the fact that SS programs tend to induce retirement since that is
its main purpose. The theory is also consistent with no assets test, with the fact that benefits are increasing
functions of lifetime wages (it will take a high pension to “bribe” a worker with a high wage out of the labor
force) or why proof of disability is not required. The model is also consistent with some kind of public
intervention and with the fact that SS exists even with small populations of elderly.
27

However, the model does not explain why SS has grown so much in countries where unemployment does
not appear to be a large problem (the United States being a primary example). Nor does it explain why the
government pays the old not to work rather than paying the young, women, teenagers, or some other group. More
work also needs to be done to demonstrate the reasons for “involuntary unemployment” and to show what they
imply for the design of SS.
Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1999) suggest that the “lump of labor” theory is not a theory itself, but a
byproduct of another theory of SS and induced retirement. They suggest that the scientific or economic validity
of the “lump of labor” story is irrelevant. It is just rhetoric, a part of the political pressure applied by the old (the
pressure, in turn, is possible because the old are induced to retire) - they are trying to convince a young citizen
that SS is in his interest too. Since any one person’s influence on policy is negligible, a young person has very
little incentive to resist the theories presented to him by the old (eg., by checking whether they are scientifically
or economically correct).

II.C. Monopoly Capitalism
It has been suggested that government transfers occur in order to pacify beneficiaries, preventing them
from (say) revolting against the state. This argument has been applied to Social Security in the neo- Marxist
literature on "monopoly capitalism" (eg., Piven and Cloward 1971, Olson 1982; Pampel and Williamson 1989
survey this literature on their pp. 29-34), where it is said that capitalists want to force old workers out of their
jobs because the old workers are less productive than young workers. The unemployed old are a political threat
to the state, so payments are made to them by the government so that they might be pacified. In these two
dimensions, the monopoly capitalism approach is quite similar to the time intensive political competition model
of Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1999) and the human capital model of Sala-i-Martin (1996): the old, rather than
the young, receive substantial payments from the state and those payments are contingent on labor force status
rather than poverty. Furthermore, both approaches assume and important link between labor force status and
political influence. In sharp contrast with Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin, the monopoly capitalism approach may
even predict that the old should be paid even more if they emigrate because presumably emigrants are less of a
threat to the government than are angry residents.
We refer to the monopoly capitalism theory has a "narrative theory" because we are unaware of a
mathematical presentation of the theory, an attempt to explain cross-country differences in Social Security, an
attempt to explain how capitalists act monopolistically, or even a derivation of several refutable empirical

28

implications.20

II.D. Sub-but-Nearly-Optimal Policy Response to Private Pensions
Private pension plans are also associated with rules encouraging or mandating retirement (eg., Lazear
1979, Kotlikoff and Wise 1987). If these alone cause enough people to retire, then perhaps it is not a big deal
if a public SS program provides an additional retirement incentive. Nor, the argument goes, would it be a big deal
if the government were to mimic private pension plans in other dimensions such as choice of retirement age or
use of the payroll tax.
We are unaware of a mathematical model exposing this narrative theory. Even supposing that the theory
is logically correct, it needs four ingredients in order to explain the main facts about SS:
(i)

a theory of why private pensions induce retirement

(ii)

a theory of why older generations are the beneficiaries of SS

(iii)

a theory of why the same sub-but-nearly-optimal policies are adopted by so many governments

(iv)

private pensions must affect enough people that public pensions are affecting mainly people
who already retire because of private pensions

The first ingredient is easily found (eg., Lazear 1979), although it is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate
the empirical validity of the Lazear and other explanations for private sector rules inducing retirement. We show
in this and the companion paper how a theory of why the old are the beneficiaries (rather than the young, the poor,
or some other group) is difficult to derive. Since there are so many nearly-optimal policies which could be pursued
by governments (eg., very heavy taxes on goods few people consume), we are unaware of an explanation why
nearly every government in the world would adopt a particular one - encouraging retirement among those who
(according to the theory) would retire anyway.
Item (iv) also finds limited support, since quite a number of U.S. SS beneficiaries are not private pension
recipients (Diamond 1977, Table 1) and private pensions also fail to cover a number of European workers
(Torrey and Thompson 1980). With so many people not on private pensions and without a justification for public
retirement inducements, it seems that a SS benefit decreasing with the recipient’s labor income is quite far from
optimal.

III. Implications of the Theories for Reform

20

Cawson (1985), Pampel and Williamson (1989) criticize the monopoly capitalism literature on
these grounds.
29

III.A. A Forced Savings Plan
Consider a forced savings “reform” of SS like the Kotlikoff and Sachs (1998) Personal Security System
(PSS). From the point of view of the positive theories above, the main provisions of the plan are:
(i)

the elderly are no longer given incentives to retire

(ii)

benefits are effectively means tested, where “means” is determined according to income during
working life

(iii)

eventually the old will consume more relative to the young than they would under the current
system (according to Kotlikoff-Sachs projections)

(iv)

some taxes paid by the young are used to pay the old and the rest are invested in physical capital
markets

(v)

benefits for the initial old are effectively reduced, because a consumption tax is used to finance
the transition

For the sake of argument, our analysis begins with the supposition that any change the reformers intend to be
permanent are actually permanent.

III.B. Reform Evaluated According to Efficiency Theories
According to the efficiency models, SS is designed the way it is in order to enhance efficiency. An
extreme version of this view is that SS is fully optimal, in which case changing the design of Social Security
cannot increase welfare unless technology has changed (rendering obsolete policies which were once efficiency
enhancing). “Fully optimal” means that welfare has already been maximized!
A less extreme efficiency view is that each provision of SS enhances welfare - welfare would be reduced
if any of the provisions were eliminated - but that further welfare gains are possible by quantitatively revising
some provisions. For example, one may suppose that efficiency is enhanced when the government encourages
retirement, but that many governments have gone too far in this direction.
The proposed reform completely eliminates retirement incentives. The “cross-firm human capital”,
“optimal retirement insurance”, and “welfare for the elderly” models all call for retirement incentives, so this
particular reform provision is welfare reducing. The reform does help those who are “poor” in terms of lifetime
earnings - a potential benefit under the “welfare” view - but the removal of the earnings test and the raising of
retirement incomes are movements away from progressivity. We therefore enter in Table 2 that reform decreases
welfare in these three models.
According to the “return on human capital investment” model, payments to the old are a return on past
investments. Paying less to the old than promised (via the sales tax), looks like a capital levy in the model and
30

may be efficient to the extent that the reform does not produce the expectation of future capital levies. Or it may
be that the old were being paid more than they promised, in which case the reform is a movement towards greater
efficiency. However, the provision (iv) seems to divert funds from human capital investment which is just the
opposite as suggested by the “return on human capital investment” model with rtss $ r; we record in Table 2 that
reform reduces welfare in the model.
Public pensions are very near substitutes for private pensions in the administrative scale economies
model, with the former preferred because the government enjoys lower transactions costs. Diamond (1993)
suggests that many privatization proposals will forego the administrative economies, so our Table 2 indicates that
reform reduces welfare in the administrative scale economies model. It should be pointed out that Kotlikoff and
Sachs (1998) suggest that their plan would retain the low administrative costs of their system. Even so, reform
would still decrease welfare in the administrative scale economies model because the current system is a close
substitute for private pensions (probably closer than the PSS system, since both the current and private systems
encourage retirement) and, we presume, private pensions are designed the way workers want them to be designed.
An even weaker efficiency view is that some provisions of SS enhance welfare while other provisions
decrease it, with a net effect of welfare enhancement. This may be true, but in this case the efficiency model no
longer serves as a positive theory of the inefficient provisions. Before proposing and evaluating a reform of those
provisions, we believe that it is necessary to have a positive theory of them. Nevertheless, this view must be
adopted if we are to analyze reform in the prodigal father, longevity insurance, or misguided Keynesian models
because these three models explain relatively little about the design of actual SS programs.
There is no role for induced retirement in the prodigal father and longevity insurance models. Indeed,
eliminating the retirement test and mandating purchases of annuities seems like the exact solution suggested by
the prodigal father and longevity insurance models. These models say less about the desirability of fully funding
the program, but our Table 2 records a welfare increase of reform in these models.
Encouraging savings is a bad idea in the Keynesian model, but Sargent (1998) argues that the Keynesian
model is simultaneously incorrect and a motivator of policy. Assuming that PSS's encourage savings (they may
not if they encourage enough work during old age), they improve welfare in Sargent's “Misguided Keynesian”
view.
A positive theory can provide a framework for evaluating reform, but it can also be used to determine
whether reform plans are credible. In particular, the elimination of induced retirement occurs under the PSS plan
but is undesirable according to the “cross-firm human capital”, “optimal retirement insurance”, “welfare for the
elderly”, and “administrative cost” efficiency models. Hence, these models suggest that provision (i) of the PSS
system is unlikely to be implemented or to remain implemented. The “welfare for the elderly” model also suggest
31

that a SS program will not provide much more consumption for the old than enjoyed by the young, because the
model emphasizes redistribution from rich to poor.
Eliminating induced retirement is credible in the prodigal father model, since induced retirement serves
no efficient purpose. Pareto optimal allocations are feasible in the model regardless of whether the system is fully
funded or not. However, as discussed in our Section I.D, full funding benefits the unborn at the expense of the
living, and is anticipated to have little political support. Nor does the prodigal father model offer much reason
to expect a SS program to remain fully funded into the indefinite future.

III.C. Reform Evaluated According to Political Theories
Reform looks better from the point of view of the political theories because the outcome of redistribution
need not be efficient, although the political theories may question the political feasibility of reform.
Induced retirement is, in a sense, used for rent-seeking in the time-intensive political competition model.
Successfully eliminating induced retirement would thereby reduce rent seeking and increase aggregate efficiency.
However, through an income effect on the elderly, forced savings increases leisure and political activity by the
elderly. An income effect on the young decreases their leisure, while a substitution effect (because labor income
taxes are used to finance the forced savings) increases it. The net effect of the PSS plan may well be greater rentseeking, more intergenerational redistribution, and less aggregate efficiency. Table 2 therefore records an
ambiguous effect of reform in the time-intensive political competition model.
Induced retirement serves neither an efficiency nor a political purpose in the voting models, so
eliminating it enhances efficiency. Kotlikoff and Sachs (1998) also plan to reduce the amount of intergenerational
redistribution (with the consumption tax in the short run and forced savings in the long run), which also tends
to increase efficiency.
Holding constant the amount of redistribution, induced retirement reduces efficiency in the taxpayer
protection model. However, the model also suggests that induced retirement reduces the amount of redistribution,
and less redistribution enhances aggregate efficiency. It is therefore ambiguous whether a reform eliminating
induced retirement enhances efficiency.21
All of the political approaches view redistribution is an equilibrium outcome, and cannot be eliminated
merely with a “plan.” Fundamental political reform, not just plans to change tax and expenditure policy, is
probably needed to reduce the amount of redistribution.

21

See Becker and Mulligan (1998) for a quantitative analysis of the tradeoffs between efficient policy
and redistribution.
32

Efficiency and political approaches have different implications and hence can be distinguished on the
basis of observations. In our view, the available observations give the most credence to the political approaches
and most credence to the view that SS reform must also include political reform in order to be effective.

IV. Conclusions
In this and a companion paper (Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin 1999b), we introduce a number of facts about
and theories of SS. We show how the facts are important for distinguishing among the theories and derive some
predictions of the theories for reform. We find a few theories offering favorable evaluations of a reform plan like
that proposed by Kotikoff and Sachs (1998), but those theories are least consistent with the facts. Other theories
suggest that the plan reduces welfare and/or that the plan is not possible without political reform.
Public Finance evaluations of social security reform often find reform to be welfare improving. Why are
we more sanguine? Part of the explanation is that public finance assumes from the outset that policy embodies
some mistakes and makes no attempt to explain the source of those mistakes. Part of the explanation may also
be that analysts implicitly believe those theories in which intergenerational transfers are undesirable.22 In either
case, we point out that the vast majority of SS programs in the world have a lot of features in common, features
which are inconsistent with a number of positive theories of SS. Is it that policymakers all over the world are
making the same mistakes decade after decade? Or are economists missing other important economic, political,
and social forces creating and sustaining SS?
We point out two important areas for future research. The first is empirical work verifying and refuting
those facts we have shown to be crucial for distinguishing among positive theories. Second, relatively few
explanations for the induced retirement provisions of SS are available so there is a demand for additional
explanations. One source of additional explanations may be to combine two or more of the theories presented
here. With 11 or more theories on the table, there are at least 55 ways to combine them two at a time; we await
further evidence and reaction from readers before examining combinations of theories.

22

Some may also believe national savings is inadequate for other reasons so that a fully funded
system improves upon an otherwise equivalent unfunded system for reasons unrelated to the existence of SS.
