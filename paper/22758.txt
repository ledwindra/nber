ABSTRACT
Gourinchas and Rey (2007) have shown that international financial adjustment (IFA) in the path
of expected future returns on a country’s international investment portfolio can complement or
even substitute for the traditional adjustment channel via a narrowing of country’s current
account imbalance. In their paper, GR derive this result using a log linearization of a net foreign
asset accumulation identity without reference to any specific theoretical model of IFA in expected
foreign asset returns or the real exchange rate. In this paper we calibrate the importance of IFA in
a standard open economy growth model (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2003) with a well-defined
steady level of foreign liabilities. In this model there is a country specific credit spread which
varies as a function of the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP. We find that allowing for an IFA
channel results in a very rapid converge of the current account to its steady state (relative to the
no IFA case) so that most of the time that the country is adjusting, all the adjustment is via the
IFA channel of forecastable changes in the costs of servicing debt and in the appreciation real
exchange rate. By contrast, in the no IFA case, current account adjustment by construction does
all the work and current account adjustment is much slower.

Introduction

In inuential work, Gourinchas and Rey (2007) have shown that international nancial
adjustment (IFA) in the expected returns on a countrys international investment portfolio
as well as the expected path of the real exchange rate can complement or even substitute
for the traditional adjustment channel via a narrowing of countrys unsustainable current
account imbalance. In their paper, GR derive this result using a log linearization of a
net foreign asset accumulation identity without reference to any speci c theoretical
model of international nancial adjustment in expected foreign asset returns or the
real exchange rate. In this paper we calibrate the importance of IFA in a standard open
economy growth model (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2003) with a well-de ned steady level
of foreign liabilities. In this model there is a country speci c credit spread which varies as
a function of the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP.
We study a perfect foresight version of the model so that we can characterize the global
dynamic adjustment in net foreign assets, the endogenous cost of debt service, and the path
of the real exchange rate. This is important, because in this model, in a neighborhood of
the steady state, IFA is not very important. However, away from the steady state  we look
at simulations in which the initial stock of foreign debt is 10 percent above its steady state
ratio to GDP and the initial capital stock is 10 percent below its steady state ratio to GDP 
IFA is very important. In fact in our baseline simulation in which we calibrate the elasticity
of the country credit spread to the debt to GDP ratio based on plausible empirical estimates
from the literature as well as our own estimates, we nd that allowing for an IFA channel

results in a very rapid converge of the current account to its steady state (relative to the
no IFA case) so that most of the time that the country is adjusting , all the adjustment is
via forecastable changes in the costs of servicing debt and in the appreciation real exchange
rate and none of the adjustment is in the current account. By contrast, in the no IFA
case, current account adjustment by construction does all the work and current account
adjustment is much slower. Finally we show that IFA adjustment via the real exchange rate
can be important even if forecastable changes in the cost of debt service are not.

Channels of the small open economys international
nancial adjustment

Countries can stabilize their net international investment position through two channels: the
trade channel and the nancial channel. As net foreign liabilities today must be compensated
by trade surpluses in the future, the trade channel contributes to the external adjustment
of the country by the adjustment in the value of the goods and services that the country
imports or exports. However, the forecastable increase in the real returns on the net foreign
assets or forecastable decrease in the real cost of servicing net international liabilities (i.e.
the nancial channel) can substitute for adjustment in trade ows. Thus, the nancial
channel contributes to the external adjustment of the country through the adjustment in
real interest rates and real exchange rates.
To illustrate this formally, we rst derive a log-linearized version of the balance of payment
accounting identity with gross international liability position, l t ; and zero gross international
asset position2 :
lt =  (lt+1 rt+1 ) + (1 ) nxt
(1)
where rt+1 is the interest payed on gross international liabilities,  is the discount rate and
nxt are net exports. Iterating forward on expression (1), the gross liability position of the
country becomes:
P1 j
P1 j

r

nx

(2)
lt =

t+j
j=1  nxt+j
j=1

where the rst term is the discounted sum of future returns, which captures all the
international adjustments through the nancial channel, the second and third terms are
the discounted sum of future changes in the net exports, which captures the adjustment
through the trade channel.
There is little empirical evidence on how important these channels are in countries

Section 1 of the Theory Appendix outlines the derivation of this log-linearized identity.

international adjustment. Gourinchas and Rey (2007) nd that about 27% of the cyclical
international adjustment of the United States has been realized through the nancial channel,
primarily through a forecastable adjustment in the real exchange rate. But we do not have
empirical evidence in the case of other countries such as Japan, UK or the Euro Zone.
Moreover, we do not have any evidence on how important role these channels play in the
case of emerging economies. Intuitively, we can expect that the nancial channel may play
an even more important role in the case of developing and emerging economies than it does
in the case of developed ones, especially in the case of the emerging economies with larger
external debt position.
The reduced form balance of payment identity allows for quantifying the size of the two
channels. However, it does not give any insight about how the real interest rate and real
exchange rate channel interact with the trade channel. Moreover, as it is an identity and
there is no micro-foundation behind it, it is not suitable for studying the mechanisms through
which the trade and nancial channels operate. Thus, the challenge is to nd a theoretical
machinery that rationalizes this resource constraint.
The small open economy real business cycle model rationalizes the intertemporal resource
constraint in (1). This class of models augmented with endogenous interest and exchange
rates provides a simple and elegant laboratory to understand how the nancial and trade
channels operate in an intertemporal framework that pins down the equilibrium path of the
real cost of servicing international debt and the real cost of borrowing from the international
markets. This framework also allows for studying the interaction between the trade and
nancial channel, and sheds light on the mechanism through which these channels operate.
In this paper, we focus on emerging economies. We write down two versions of the
small open economy real business cycle model that rationalizes the balance of payment
accounting identity, thus quantifying the relative importance of the two channels becomes
possible. Moreover, these models provide a micro-foundation for studying the way these
channels operate, the way they interact with each other and the mechanism through which
they operate. We present these models in the next section.

Theoretical framework

In this section, we consider two versions of the small open economy real business cycle
model that rationalizes the intertemporal resource constraint. This model augmented with
endogenous interest rate, respectively with real exchange rate provides a simple and elegant
laboratory to study the relative importance of the trade and nancial channels in the external
adjustment process of the small open economy, while also allowing for an interaction between
3

these two channels. It also allows for shedding light on the potential mechanism through
which these channels operate.
First, we consider the non-stochastic version of the small open economy real business
cycle model augmented with the debt dependent interest rate. While writing down this
model, we closely follow the functional form assumptions made by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2003). In this framework we can study the relative importance of the trade and real interest
rate channels in the external adjustment of the small open economy.
As a next step, we zoom into the nancial channel. We consider a version of the small
open economy real business cycle model that allows us to disentangle the real interest rate
and real exchange rate channels. In particular, we write down a non-stochastic version of
the small open economy real business cycle model with debt dependent interest rate that is
augmented with tradables and non-tradables sectors. In this model, the price of tradable
relative to non-tradable pins down the real exchange rate. This framework allows us to study
the relative importance of the trade, real exchange rate and real interest rate channels in the
external adjustment of the small open economy. Thus, the main advantage of this framework
relative to the previous one is that it allows for the decomposition of the nancial channel
into two components: the real exchange rate and the real interest rate channels.

3.1

The small open economy RBC model with external interest
rate

3.1.1

The setup

We start by assuming that the country is a small open economy populated by a large number
of identical households. We assume that the representative households per-period utility,
U (); is derived from consumption, ct ; and hours worked, ht . Following the RBC literature on
small open economies, we assume that the representative households preference is modeled
as GHH (Greenwood et al., 1988). This implies the following functional form for U ():
U (Ct ; ht ) =

(Ct

h!t =!)1
1 



(3)

where ! and  are utility parameters capturing the elasticity of substitution between
consumption and hours worked, respectively the elasticity of substitution of the consumption
today with consumption tomorrow. Thus, the discounted sum of per-period utility is given
by:
1
X
t
max
U (ct ; ht )
(4)
t=0

4

where 2 (0; 1) is the discount factor.
The representative households per-period budget constraint is:
dt+1 = (1 + rt (dt+1 ))dt + ct + it

yt +  (kt+1

kt )

(5)

where dt is the stock of debt that the small open economy accumulates up until period t-1
by borrowing in the international nancial markets, d t+1 is the stock of external debt that
consists of the stock of debt at the end of period t-1 plus the new loans contracted by the
small open economy on the international markets in the tth period; it denotes investment in
period t; yt is the domestic output in period t; and kt is the stock of physical capital at the
end of period t-1.
The interest rate at which the small open economy borrows on the international markets
in period t is rt . Following Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003)3 , we assume that the domestic
interest rate is the sum of the world interest rate on the international nancial markets, r ,
and the spread that the small open economy pays upon borrowing on these markets. We
assume that the country spread is endogenous. Its size depends on the deviation of the
e and the debt

(6)

These assumptions on the functional form of the domestic real interest rate imply that
the cost of borrowing that the small open economy faces on the international markets is
increasing in the world interest rate, the debt elasticity of the country spread (i.e. the more
sensitive is the country spread to uctuations in the external debt position of the country
relative to its steady state), and the deviation of the debt to output ratio relative to its
steady state.
Function () is the capital adjustment cost that the representative consumer acquires
for each unit of investment made in physical capital4 . Following Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe
(2003), we assume that the capital adjustment cost is modeled as a quadratic function of
the current and past capital stock levels, and it captures the fact that faster adjustments in
3

Technically, this functional form assumption ensures that the non-stochastic steady state of the model
is independent of the initial conditions, and thus it is stationary.
4
Technically, the role of this capital adjustment cost in the small open economy RBC model is to dampen
the large volatility of investment in response to changes in the interest rate. The functional form is chosen
such that in steady state the adjustment cost is zero, as we assume that (0) = 0 (0) = 0, and thus the
marginal product of capital matches exactly the interest rate.

 (kt+1 ; kt ) =

(7)

We assume that capital depreciates at rate  2 (0; 1): Thus, the stock of physical capital
owned by the representative household at time t is the stock at the end of period t-1; net
of depreciation, plus the value of the new investment, captured by the following capital
accumulation equation:
(8)
kt+1 = (1 ) kt + it
Output is produced by hiring labor, ht ; and using physical capital, kt ; in order to produce
consumption goods, yt ; based on a neoclassical production technology:
yt = F (kt ; ht )

We assume that the production function is Cobb-Douglas with

F (kt ; ht ) = kt h1t

3.2.1

The setup

In this version of the model, we assume that the representative households utility, U (); is
derived from consumption of tradable goods, ct ; consumption of non-tradable goods cnt ; and
hours worked, ht . We assume that tradable and non-tradables consumption is aggregated into
total consumption in the households utility in a Cobb-Douglas way, with b being the share
of non-tradable in total consumption, while consumption and hours worked are aggregated
by a CES function as in the previous version of the model:
U (cnt ; ct ; ht ) =

Thus, the discounted sum of per-period utility is given by:

U (cnt ; ct ; ht )

(20)

t=0

where 2 (0; 1) is the discount factor.
The representative households per-period budget constraint evaluated at the price of
tradables relative to the non-tradables is as follows:
pt dt+1 = pt (1 + rt (dt+1 ))dt + pt ct + cnt + pt it


yt + pt (kt+1
2

kt ) 2

(21)

By comparing equation (20) with equation (5), one can easily notice that the only
di¤erence between the two versions of the model is given by the assumption on the two
sectors of the economy, tradables and non-tradables. We need these assumptions in order
to pin down the equilibrium path of the real exchange rate de ned as the price of tradables
relative to non-tradables5 .
5

Based on this de nition of the relative price, the real exchange rate is de ned as the price of one unit

7

The total output in this economy is given by the sum of the output produced by the two
sectors of the economy:
yt = Nt + pt Tt
(22)
We assume that the nature of the technology in the tradable sector is Cobb-Douglas, and
this sector uses capital and labor to produce output Tt :
Tt = kt h1t

(23)

Moreover, we assume that the production in the non-tradable sector is based on an
endowment which is xed6 over time to N :
Nt = N

The representative household maximizes lifetime utility (20) subject to the budget constraint

Calibration

In order to solve the system of di¤erence equations that characterize the optimal decision of
the small open economy in the two versions of the RBC model considered in the previous
section, we have to assign values to the model parameters. In this section we describe the
way we calibrate these parameters which we group in two categories: nancial parameters
such as the elasticity of country spread and other model parameters.

4.1

The elasticity of country spread with respect to the debt to
GDP ratio

The elasticity of country spread with respect to the debt to GDP ratio of the small open
economy, ; plays an important role in understanding the channels through which the small
open economy adjusts externally. As the size of this parameter determines the size of the
country spread for a given gap between the actual and steady state debt to GDP ratio, it
has implications for the importance of the nancial channel relative to the trade channel.
The small open economy real business cycle literature focusing on emerging economies
has been traditionally calibrating this parameter to the value 0.001. This calibration was
rst introduced by Mendoza (1991) that studied real business cycle uctuations in the case
of the Canadian economy. This calibration quantitatively implies a country spread which is
close to zero. As we show in Table 1, a 0.1 increase in the debt to GDP ratio relative to
the steady state induces only one basis point increase in the country spread. The cost of
borrowing of the small open economy is about the same as the world interest rate, exogenous
to the small open economy, under this calibration.Thus, we expect that none or only a tiny
fraction of the overall external adjustment is through the nancial channel. We label this

9

case as the "No nancial adjustment" case as outlined in the third column of Table 1.

The empirical literature which investigates the determinants of country spread (Cantor
and Packer, 1996; Eichengreen and Mody, 1998; Hilscher; Rowland and Torres, 2004;
Nosbusch et al, 2010) has concluded that it is misleading to assume that country spread is
exogenous, by pointing out that there is not only a certain feedback relationship between the
country spread and the world interest rate, but the country spread also reacts to movements
in economic fundamentals such as the degree of the external indebtedness of the country. A
series of reduced form papers have shown recently that in the case of emerging economies
the elasticity of country spread with respect to uctuations in the external debt position of
these countries is much larger. For instance, Rowland and Torres (2004) estimate, by using
panel data econometrics techniques, that an average increase of 0.1 in the debt to GDP
ratio implies a 70 basis point increase on average in the JP Morgan EMBI Global spread
in the case of a panel of sixteen emerging economies. Considering a larger set of emerging
economies, a panel of thirty-one countries, Hilscher et al. (2010) also document a similar
size of the elasticity of country spread: they estimate in a panel regression framework that a
0.1 increase in the debt to GDP ratio implies an increase of the country spread by about 50
basis points.
In addition to these reduced form ndings, we also document in this paper that the
elasticity of country spread with respect to the debt to GDP ratio is much higher than
0.001. By using Bayesian estimation techniques, we estimate a small open economy real
business cycle model with endogenous country spread in the case of ve Central and Eastern

The posterior mean ranges between 0.04 and 0.08, suggesting that the size of elasticity of
country spread with respect to the debt to GDP ratio implied by the structure of the small
open economy RBC model and observables on output, consumption, investment and net
exports, is consistent with the reduced form ndings. An increase in the debt to GDP ratio
by 0.1 induces about 70 basis point increase in the spread on average across the ve countries
in the case for which we performed the estimation.
Thus, in line with the reduced form ndings of the previous literature and the structural
estimates documented in this paper, we consider a case in which we calibrate the parameter
to 0.07. As outlined in Table 1, we consider a third case in which we calibrate to 1.3, a value
that is documented by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2016) in the case of Argentina. However,
this large elasticity implies a 1300 basis point increase in the country spread for a 0.1 increase
in the debt to GDP ratio.

4.2

Other parameters of the model

We calibrate the other parameters of the models by closely following the calibration used
in the real business cycle literature on emerging economies as summarized in Table 3. We
calibrate the capital share of income ( ) to the long-run average of the compensation of
labor input to value added ratio in emerging economies. The rate of depreciation of capital
() is calibrated to 0.1.
The preference parameters are set as follows: the coe¢cient of relative risk aversion ()

The model is similar in structure to the model outlined in this paper. Details on the model and the
estimation are included in Section C of the Appendix.

debt to GDP ratio, is set to 0.744 in line with Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003) who argue
that this is consistent with the average of the net foreign asset to GDP ratio across emerging
economies. Following the same paper, we calibrate the capital adjustment cost parameter
() to 8. The rationale behind this large value is twofold. On the one hand, adjusting capital
stock in emerging economies is costly given a series of capital market frictions that are not
present in developed economies. On the other hand, setting this parameter to a lower value
would imply that investment is too volatile relative to the data.
Finally, we assume that the non-tradable sector accounts for about 70% of the total
output of the small open economy setting in this way parameter b to 0.7. Moreover, we
assume that the endowment in the non-tradable sector is constant over time and we set it
to 70. This is a simplifying assumption which does not have implications for the conclusions
at which we arrive based on the simulation exercise in the next section.

The External Financial Adjustment of the Small
Open Economy

In this section we use the two small open economy real business cycle models outlined in
Section 3 to study how the nancial and trade channels operate in an explicit intertemporal
model that pins down the equilibrium paths of real exchange rate and forecastable returns
on the net international investment position of the small open economy. Moreover, by using
the calibrations presented in the previous section, we simulate the non-linear model under
the assumption of perfect foresight to study how the two nancial channels interact with the
trade channel and shed light on the mechanism through which these channels operate.
The ndings of the simulation exercise are striking. First, we show that the nancial
channel plays a more important role relative to the trade channel in the external adjustment
of the emerging countries when the countrys external spread is more sensitive to uctuations
in the debt to GDP ratio relative to the steady state. This is mainly due to the positive
nancial externality present in the model implied mechanism, the importance of which
increases with the debt elasticity of the spread. Second, we document that initial conditions
matter for the type of the channel through the country undergoes the external adjustment.
The results of the simulation exercise show that the larger the initial external debt position
of the country relative to steady state is, the more important the nancial channel is. Third,
we show that the nancial channel plays a more important role than the trade channel in
the long run. Finally, we show that the global results are di¤erent from the local ones:
the nancial channel plays a smaller role in the log-linearized model. The following two
sections present the details and demonstrate these ndings. First, we take the small open
economy RBC model augmented with endognous country spread and simulate it to study the
importance of the real interest rate channel, as the only nancial channel in this version of
the model, relative to the trade channel. Then, we simulate the second version of the model
that encompasses both the real interest rate and real exchange rate as nancial channels.

5.1

The Role of the Real Interest Rate Channel

In order to study the relative importance of the trade and real interest rate channels in the
small open economys external adjustment process, we rst perform simulations of the small
open economy real business cycle model augmented by endogenous country spread. Thus, in
this version of the model the real interest rate is the only channel of nancial adjustment. We
calibrate the system of non-linear equations in (11) - (18). As we assume perfect foresight,
this exercise is nothing else than a deterministic simulation of the non-linear equilibrium

13

conditions by using numerical methods. Thus, we can study the global dynamics of the
simulated adjustment instead of the local one which was the case if we log-linearized the
system. We simulate the adjustment of the model economy back to the steady state from an
initial state in which all the model variables, except the capital stock and the external debt
position, are at their steady state value. We assume that initially the capital stock is by 10%
below its steady state, while the external debt position is by 10% above its steady state. We
perform the simulation in two cases. First we assume that the elasticity of country spread,
, is low by calibrating it to 0.001. Then, we keep all the parameter values the same but we
increase the value of to 0.07. The results of the simulation under the two calibrations of
are summarized in Figure 1. These simulation results suggest a series of interesting ndings.
First, the nancial channel seems to play a much more important role than the trade
channel when the country spread is more sensitive to uctuations in the debt to GDP ratio
relative to the steady state. By comparing the adjustment path of the external debt, the
country spread, the current account and the trade balance; we can easily notice that the
external adjustment takes place through a combination of the trade and real interest rate
channels. However, starting from period thirty the type of the adjustment becomes very
di¤erent across the two economies. In particular, the external adjustment of the economy
that has low elasticity of the spread (i.e. calibrated to 0.001) is only through adjustment
in current account starting from period thirty. As the cost of borrowing is not sensitive to
the increase in external debt, the country over-borrows in order to build up capital stock
and all the external adjustment is through the trade channel. On the other hand, in the
economy with the larger elasticity of the spread most of the adjustment in the initial periods
and all of the adjustment on the long run is through the nancial channel, i.e. the real
interest rate channel. As the country spread is sensitive to uctuations in the external debt
in this economy, the country will pay down debt and build up capital stock by saving and
running trade surplus in the initial periods of the adjustment. But in period thirty, the
economy reaches the level of external debt and capital stock that is consistent with the
steady state level of trade balance and current account. Thus, starting from this period all
the adjustment is through the real interest rate channel. This di¤erence in the importance of
the nancial channel across economies with di¤erent values of becomes even more striking
when we calibrate this parameter to 1.3. Appendix E.1. summarizes the simulation results
which suggest that essentially all the external adjustment is through the nancial channel
when the country spread is extremely sensitive to uctuations in the external debt position

14

relative to steady state.
Figure 1. Results of the simulation of the small open economy RBC model
with endogenous country spread

Note: Initial external debt above and capital below the steady state by 10%.
The rest of the model variables are initially at steady state.

15

Second, by examining the adjustment path of consumption per capita and utility, one
can notice that there seems to be a gain from the nancial adjustment. This is because
the nancial adjustment rewards countries for paying down debt. This is rationalized in the
model by the positive nancial externality created by the endogenous country spread. Since
the spread depends on the deviation of the external debt to GDP ratio from its steady state,
building up capital stock and nancing domestic consumption by building up new external
debt increases the cost of borrowing tomorrow and creates debt spiral over time. Moreover,
this increase in the cost of borrowing tomorrow is larger the larger the debt elasticity of
the spread. The small open economy internalizes the consequences of building up more
debt today as it makes per-period decisions by an optimal consumption-saving decision over
time. Thus, it will start the external adjustment by saving and paying down debt in the
initial periods that generates a positive nancial externality over time, as the cost of external
borrowing falls over time. The more external debt is payed down, the larger the fall in the
cost of borrowing over time such that the spread adjusts back to a level at which the small
open economy can restart borrowing from the international markets.
The presence of the positive nancial externality in the model rationalizes the nding
that the importance of the nancial channel increases with the size of the debt elasticity of
the spread. Moreover, by the presence of this nancial externality, the nancial channel has
also non-trivial implications for welfare. Table 4 contains the sum of discounted simulated
utilities under di¤erent calibrations of the debt elasticity of country spread8 , and under the
assumption that the initial debt is above its steady state debt by 10%, while the initial
capital stock is below its steady state by 10%.

It shows that the larger
is the larger the discounted sum of lifetime utility implied by
the model. This suggests that there is always a gain from nancial adjustment because it
rewards countries over time for paying down debt.
However, the nancial externality and, thus, the nancial channel plays an important role
in the external adjustment of the small open economy if the country starts the adjustment
from an initial external debt position that is above the steady state. In order to illustrate
this, we do additional simulation exercises in which we x the initial external debt position
8

To compute this, we simulate thePconsumption and hours worked under di¤erent parametrizations of

and compute the life-time utility as t=0 U (ct ; ht ) with equal to 0.99, the discount factor value implied
by the r calibrated to 0.01.

at a level below the steady state by 0.1. Table 5 contains the sum of discounted simulated
utilities under di¤erent calibration of the debt elasticity of country spread and di¤erent
assumptions on the initial value of the external debt position and capital stock9 . Essentially,
the di¤erence in the level of life-time utilities across the economies with di¤erent is given
by the positive nancial externality that is quantitatively important when the intial external
debt is above its steady state. As Table 5 illustrates, the nancial channel matters for the
utility ranking only when the country is a net debtor on the international nancial markets.
When the initial debt is below the steady state (i.e. the initial external debt of the country
is less than the steady state value), then the discounted lifetime utility is at the same level
across the economies with and without IFA.

Finally, Figure 1 suggests that the nancial channel plays a more important role in
the external adjustment on the long run: as the country pays down external debt in the
initial periods, it starts to enjoy the bene ts of the nancial externality on the long run and
adjusts almost exclusively through the real interest rate channel. Figure 1 also suggests very
di¤erent global results from the local ones which studies the patterns of nancial adjustment
in the neighborhood of the steady state. The rst striking nding with respect to this is
that the nancial channel plays a small role in the log-linearized model. The second is that
the interesting initial non-linearity in the adjustment is ignored in the log-linearized model.
By looking at the adjustment path of the external debt position in the neighborhood of the
steady state (i.e. around period four hundred) one would ignore not only the initial overand under-shooting in the external debt position in the initial periods of the adjustment,
but also the presence of real interest rate as adjustment channel. This is mainly because the
country spread is close to zero for these values of the external debt.

To compute this, we simulate thePconsumption and hours worked under di¤erent parametrizations of
1
and compute the life-time utility as t=0 U (ct ; ht ) with equal to 0.99, the discount factor value implied
by the r calibrated to 0.01.

5.2

The Relative Importance of the Real Exchange and Interest
Rate Channels

In order to study the relative importance of the trade, real interest rate and real exchange
rate channels in the external adjustment process of the emerging economies, we rst perform
simulations of the small open economy RBC model augmented with endogenous spread,
tradable and non-tradable sectors. Thus, in this version of the model the real interest rate and
the real exchange are the channels of nancial adjustment. We calibrate the system of nonlinear equations in (25) - (33). Similarly to the previous simulation, under the assumption of
perfect foresight, we solve the non-linear equilibrium conditions by using numerical methods.
Then, we simulate the model by assuming that the initial capital stock is by 10% below its
steady state, while the external debt position is by 10% above its steady state and the
elasticity of country spread, , can take two values: 0.001 and 0.07.
The results of the simulation under the two calibration of are summarized in Figure 2.
These simulation results suggest that the ndings documented in the previous section based
on the simulation of the model with only real interest rate as nancial channel are robust
to the introduction of real exchange rate as an additional source of international nancial
adjustment. Thus, the nancial channel seems to be more important on the long run, and
in particular when the country spread is more sensitive to uctuations in the debt to GDP
ratio. The real exchange rate, de ned as the relative price of tradables adjusts over time
back to steady state through a real appreciation. However, there is essentially no signi cant
di¤erence in the adjustment path across the two economies except for the rst few periods.
All these suggest that the main source of external adjustment is the real interest rate channel

18

in the emerging economies that are characterized by debt elastic country spread.
Figure 2. Results of the simulation of the small open economy RBC model
with endogenous country spread, tradable and non-tradable sectors

Note: Initial external debt above and capital below the steady state by 10%.
The rest of the model variables are initially at steady state.

19

The importance of the nancial channel increases with the size of the debt elasticity of
the spread also when real exchange rate as IFA channel is present in the model in addition
to the country spread (i.e., the only channel of adjustment in the baseline verison of the
model considered in the previous section). Table 6 contains the sum of discounted simulated
utilities under di¤erent calibrations of the debt elasticity of country spread10 , and under
the assumption that the initial debt is above its steady state debt by 10%, while the initial
capital stock is below its steady state by 10%.

The two columns of Table 6 show that the larger
is the larger the discounted sum of
lifetime utility implied by the model. This suggests that there is always a gain from nancial
adjustment because it rewards countries over time for paying down debt.

Conclusions

In this paper we have calibrated and demonstrated the importance of IFA in a standard open
economy growth model (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003)) with a well-de ned steady level
of foreign liabilities. In this model there is a country speci c credit spread which varies as a
function of the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP. We studied a perfect foreign version of the
model so that we could characterize the global dynamic adjustment in net foreign assets, the
endogenous cost of debt service, and the path of the real exchange rate. This is important,
because in this model, in a neighborhood of the steady state, IFA is not very important.
In our baseline simulation in which we calibrate the elasticity of the country credit spread
to the debt to GDP ratio based on plausible empirical estimates from the literature as well as
our own estimates, we nd that allowing for an IFA channel results in a very rapid converge
of the current account to its steady state (relative to the no IFA case) so that most of
the time that the country is adjusting , all the adjustment is via forecastable changes in the
costs of servicing debt and in the appreciation real exchange rate and none of the adjustment
is in the current account. By contrast, in the no IFA case, current account adjustment by
construction does all the work and current account adjustment calibrated to be much slower.
Finally we show that IFA adjustment via the real exchange rate can be important even if
10
To compute this, we simulate thePconsumption and hours worked under di¤erent parametrizations of

and compute the life-time utility as t=0 U (ct ; ht ) with equal to 0.99, the discount factor value implied
by the r calibrated to 0.01.

20

forecastable changes in the cost of debt service are not. We discussed above, in this textbook
model there is a negative externality to foreign borrowing in that no borrower internalizes
that the credit spread faced by borrowers in the country are a function of aggregate debt.
We were able quantify that not only is IFA important in this model, lifetime utility in the
model with IFA is higher than in the model without even though  really because  the cost
of debt service is higher period by period until convergence is achieved.

A. Derivation of the BoP accounting identity with
zero gross international asset position

We aim to derive the log-linearized balance of payment accounting identity in the special
case when the gross international asset position of the country is zero in any time period,
i.e. At+1 = At = 0:
The BoP accounting identity in levels is:

(A.1)

where At is the gross international asset position, Lt is the gross international liability
position, Rt is the real interest rate, Xt is total exports and Mt is total imports.
The assumption At+1 = At = 0 implies that A.1 can be written as:

While the steady state value of the gross asset position is zero, i.e. A = 0.

where lt is the log-deviation of the gross liability position from its steady state, nxt is the

of the real interest rate from its steady state,   1 X LM with X, M and L being the
steady state values of exports, imports and gross liability position.
By iterating forward on A.3 we get the intertemporal balance of payment identity that
pins down the current level of gross liability as the function of the discounted sum of future
real service of the external debt and the discounted sum of future changes in net exports:

we get:

B. Estimation Appendix
The bayesian estimates of the model parameters included in Table 2 of Section X are
obtained by structurally estimating a full scale small open economy RBC model by using
4

Bayesian techniques. This model is consistent with the small open economy model with
endogenous country spread considered in Section 3. Here we augment this model with a
working capital constraint. This appendix is organized as follows. First, we outline the
model. Then we present the estimation strategy we use to parameterize the model.

The representative household chooses the sequence of values for fCt ; ht ; It ; Kt+1 ; Dt+1 ; g1

where Ct is time t consumption, ht labor supplied by the household at time t, is the discount
factor, t 1 allows for balanced growth path in utility11 , U() is twice di¤erentiable concave
utility function, increasing in its rst argument and decreasing in its second argument.
The household acquires income by supplying labor, ht to the rms and getting the wage,
wt in exchange, by renting capital, Kt to the rms at the rental rate of capital ut , and by
borrowing from, Dt+1 > 0 or by investing, Dt+1 < 0 in one period noncontingent bonds on
the international nancial market. Thus, one unit of foreign asset or debt costs qt in units
of consumption goods. The household uses this income to purchase consumption goods, Ct ;
to invest in investment goods, It and to pay back previous loans, Dt > 0, contracted from
or to sell international bonds, Dt < 0, purchased from these markets. In this way she
accumulates two types of capital stock which she owns entirely: physical capital, Kt and
internationally traded noncontingent bond, Dt . Thus, the households per period budget
constraint is:
wt ht + ut Kt + qt Dt+1 = Dt + Ct + It
(B.2)
where the left-hand side of the identity characterizes the structure of the per period income,
while the right-hand side represent the per period expenditures.
Changing the capital stock is costly and in each period t it is realized according to a
capital accumulation rule which states that the per period capital stock is nothing else than
the sum of the existing capital stock net of depreciation, plus current investments minus the
adjustment cost,  (Kt+1 ; Kt ) ; paid for each unit of capital accumulated:

This modeling technique is frequently used in the RBC literature because it improves the
performances of the model to generate moderate investment volatility and increases the
persistence of investment. By assumption, () is a strictly increasing, concave function.

B.1.2. Firms behavior
The representative rm behaves in a perfectly competitive way, hires labor, ht and rents
capital, kt in order to produce consumption goods, Yt based on a neoclassical production
technology, F ():
Yt = at F (Kt ;

(B.4)

where at models transitory technology improvement de ned as an exogenous autoregressive
stationary, ja j < 1; process of order one:
log at = a log at

(B.5)

which captures shocks to total factor productivity as one source of uncertainty through
at ; i:i:d: process with mean zero and standard deviation a : t models permanent technology
improvements as a labor augmenting productivity growth. As Aguiar and Gopinath (2007a)
showed, assuming stochastic trend improvement, the neoclassical growth model does better
job in replicating emerging market business cycle stylized facts like the countercyclical nature
of trade balance to output ratio or higher volatility of consumption than output. The main
intuition is related to the fact that as a result of a positive permanent productivity shock,
labor productivity increases permanently. This generates a larger increase in permanent
income and consumption than in current income which is nanced by issuing external debt.
In line with Aguiar and Gopinath (2007a), we assume that permanent technology shocks act
through an exogenous and mean reverting stationary process:
t

= gt

t 1

(B.6)

log (gt =) = g log (gt 1 =) + gt
where jg j < 1; gt is an i:i:d: process with mean zero and standard deviation g ; and it
models shocks to labor productivity which are incorporated into t through gt ; resulting in
trend growth improvements.  represents long-run labor productivity growth.

In other words, the working capital constraint induces an additional friction into
the model since the representative rm must borrow at Rt 1 rate of interest from the
representative household in each period in order to be able to nance  fraction of the wage
bill at the beginning of each period, in advance of the realization of the income. Neumeyer
and Perri (2005) and Uribe and Yue (2006) argue that this nancial friction creates a linkage
between interest rate movements and real economic activity, which improves the ability of the
baseline RBC model to generate strong countercyclical trade balance through the following
mechanism: falling interest rate, on the one hand, reduces the cost of labor allowing rms to
hire more labor and consequently to produce more output. On the other hand, the lower the
cost of borrowing boosts aggregate demand which generates deterioration in trade balance.
Thus output and trade balance move in the opposite direction when the cost of nancing
changes through borrowing.

B.2. Closing the Model
B.2.1 The cost of borrowing
In order to solve the model a few more assumptions are needed concerning the dynamics
of domestic and world interest rates, country spread, the price of the foreign debt, and the
functional forms of the utility, production and capital adjustment cost function.
We assume that the domestic interest rate at which households lend to rms is de ned
as the product of gross country spread, St ; and gross foreign interest rate, Rt :
Rt = St Rt

(B.8)

The dynamics of world interest rate is described by a mean reverting stationary, jr j <

The country spread is not only the function of the permanent and transitory technology
shocks, but also it depends on the households external debt position fed into the cost of
borrowing through an interest rate premium, ():

In this way, the price of the external debt is given by:

(B.12)

B.2.2. Functional forms
Households preferences are modeled according to Greenwood et al. (1988) (GHH)
preferences12 since many papers show that they improve the performances of international
RBC models in replicating business cycle stylized facts:

(Ct

t 1 ht )



; ! > 1;  > 0

(B.13)

Capital adjustment cost is modeled as a quadratic function of the current and past
capital stock level and it captures the fact that faster adjustments in the capital stock are
more expensive:

 (Kt+1 ; Kt ) =



Kt+1

(B.14)

The production function is assumed to be Cobb-Douglas, where t allows for labor
augmenting productivity growth and represents the share of labor in total income:
F (Kt ;

t ht )

= Kt1

( t ht )

(B.15)

Finally, the trade balance to output ratio is de ned as:
T BYt =

Cobb-Douglas preferences are also widely used but, as Neumeyer and Perri (2005) show, they have
poorer modeling performances in replicating emerging market stylized fact than GHH preferences.

In order to get the model to the data, a log-linear solution to the stationarized version of
the model has to be derived. Therefore we proceed in the following way: (1) we stationarize
the model by detrending all the variables which exhibit long run growth (2) then we derive
the rst order conditions, which characterize the optimal behavior of the two types of agents
in the economy (3) nally, we log-linearize the optimality conditions around the steady state
of the model. The resulting linear rational expectation system of di¤erence equations which
fully characterizes the optimal dynamics of the state and control variables was solved in
Matlab.

B.3. Calibration and estimation
In order to solve the linear rational expectation system of di¤erence equations, which fully
characterizes the optimal dynamics of the model economy, values to the model parameters
must be assigned. We do this in two di¤erent ways: we estimate, by using Bayesian
techniques, a set of parameters which are considered in the literature as being country
speci c or di¢cult to calibrate, and we calibrate the rest of the parameters.

B.3.1 Calibrated parameters
We set the value of the calibrated parameters based on long averages provided by
macroeconomic data in the case of each country13 , or we set them to values commonly
used in emerging market business cycle literature. These are presented in Table C.1 for each
13

The last section of this appendix presents the source of this data.

Table C.1. Calibrated Model Parameters
The labor share of income, ; is set at the ten years average of the compensation of labor
input to value added ratio in the case of each country. The rate of capital depreciation,
; is 0.025, which would imply a 10% annual depreciation rate and which is commonly used
in emerging market business cycles papers. The preference parameters are set as follows:
the coe¢cient of relative risk aversion, ; de ning the curvature of the utility function is
2; !; the exponent of labor in the utility function is 1.6 and the weight of labor in the per
period utility, ; is set such that it implies that households allocate h share of their total
time to working. These de nitions and parameterizations are in line with those assumed by
Schmidt-Grohe and Uribe (2003), Neumeyer and Perri (2005), Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010)
and others.
discount factor is set at 0.98 which would imply a 2.04% quarterly risk free
real interest rate.
The long run productivity growth; ; is de ned as average real GDP growth rate over
the period 2000-200914 . The steady state level of gross foreign interest rate, r ; is computed
as the quarterly average of the Euro Zone real interest rate over 2000-2009 period. d; the
long run external debt to GDP ratio, is proxied as the 1997-2007 average of the net foreign
asset to GDP ratio. The steady state share of labor, h; is de ned as the ten years average
employment to total population ratio.
14

This type of association between parameter and statistical de nition is used by Aguiar and Gopinath
(2007a) in the case of Argentina and than it was taken over by other papers, e.g. Aguiar and Gopinath
(2007b), Chang and Fernandez (2009).

B.3.2 Estimated parameters
We use Bayesian techniques as proposed by Smets and Wouters (2003), Lubik and
Schorfheide (2005) and An and Schorfheide (2007) over the sample period 1995Q1:2009Q4
in order to estimate those parameters which are country speci c (e.g. working capital
parameter, capital adjustment cost coe¢cient) or di¢cult to calibrate (e.g. the persistence
and standard deviation of di¤erent shocks, the elasticity of country spread with respect
to the Solow residual). These authors argue that the main advantage of the Bayesian
estimation of DSGE models in comparison with moment or impulse response matching is
that the parameters are seen as random variables, and a prior density which incorporate
initial beliefs and information about these parameters is speci ed together with a likelihood
function for the DSGE model. Based on these, the posterior mode of each parameter can be
computed and by using Bayes theorem to update initial beliefs, the conditional distribution
of each parameter (i.e. posterior distribution) is calculated given the observable variables
(i.e. data) and the model. An and Schorfheide (2007) point out that the main bene t of this
posterior distribution consists of the fact that it permits to perform inference concerning the
parameters and to conduct a likelihood based checking of the goodness of t.
Basically, this is a two step procedure: (1) in the rst step the posterior mode is computed
by using an optimization routine to nd that value of the parameters which minimizes the
negative log-likelihood given the model, the data based on which we perform the estimation
and prior probability distribution of the parameters to be estimated.15 The inverse of the
Hessian of the log-likelihood function is evaluated at the optimal posterior mode. (2) The
second step consists of running a Markov Chain Metropolis-Hastings (MCMH) algorithm
which constructs a Gaussian approximation around the posterior mode in the following way:
it draws a number from a normal distribution characterized by mean equal to the posterior
mode obtained in the previous step and variance-covariance matrix set at the inverse of the
log-likelihood function evaluated at the same posterior mode and scaled up by a constant
(i.e. jumping distribution). Then it decides whether to accept this newly drawn value as
the mean of the jumping distribution used for the next draw with a certain probability (i.e.
acceptance ratio computed as the ratio between the log-likelihood of the model evaluated
at the newly drawn parameter and the same likelihood evaluated at the parameter value
obtained from the previous draw) or to continue with the parameter value obtained from
the previous draw, with probability one minus the acceptance ratio. The more these draws
are repeated the more e¢ciently and e¤ectively the algorithm can explore the posterior
15

To nd the optimal value of the posterior mode we use a Monte-Carlo based optimization routine, with
100000 simulations, implemented in Dynare. This turned out to be a more robust method than solving a
simple constrained minimization problem.

11

distribution in the neighborhood of the posterior mode.
Therefore three main ingredients are needed to implement the above described procedure:
the model, the observable variables and the de nition of the prior distribution of the
estimated parameters. Firstly, the model has to be written in a linear rational expectation
system form which is solved by using numerical methods.16 Then the model is written in
state space form together with the measurement equations while its likelihood is computed
by using the Kalman lter.
Secondly, the observable variables must be de ned and fed into the model. We use
four observable variables because they are available in the case of all countries and the
methodology based on which they are collected should not di¤er across countries. These
are the HP ltered quarterly gross domestic product (obsY ), consumption (obsC) and
investment (obsIN V E) taken in logarithm and HP ltered trade balance to output ratio
(obsT BY ) over the period 1995:1-2009:4. We assume that these observables are subject to
measurement errors because of two reasons. One reason is technical in nature, and it aims
to overcome the stochastic singularity problem, i.e. the number of structural shocks in the
model must be equal to the number of observables considered for the estimation. Since in the
present models there are three, respectively four shocks, at least one measurement error must
be included while estimating the uniform interest rate and non-persistent country spread
version of the model or at least two measurement errors have to be de ned when estimating
the uniform interest rate and persistent country spread extension. We assume that the
measurement errors fobsY ; obsC ; obsI ; obsT BY g follow i:i:d: processes with zero mean and
z2=fobsY ;obsC ;obsI ;obsT BY g standard deviation. The other reason for de ning measurement
errors is related to the potential role they play in conducting robustness check of the
results. Therefore, when estimating the model we distinguish two cases: estimation without
measurement errors, when we augment the state space just by as many measurement errors
as many are needed to overcome the stochastic singularity problem, versus estimation with
measurement errors, when we consider that all the observables contain measurement error.
By considering that macroeconomic data usually contain errors and omissions because of
aggregation, changes in methodologies, de nitions, rules and regulations applied during
collecting them the inclusion of measurement errors should improve the estimation results if
the errors are indeed inuential.
Finally, the prior distribution is usually subjective because it describes uncertainty and
prior knowledge about the model and its parameters. We select the shape of the distribution
16

For this we use perturbation methods implemented in Dynare toolbox which provide as a solution a
linear dynamic version of the model which contains the dynamics of the state and control variables, i.e.
policy functions.

12

based on those applied in earlier papers on emerging market business cycles and based on the
restrictions regarding possible domain of de nition of di¤erent parameters. The expected
value and standard deviation of each distribution assumed are set at values provided by
macroeconomic data. Overall, we estimate eleven structural parameters, as reported in
Table 5 which can be divided into two groups.

Table C.2 Prior Distribution of the Estimated Model Parameters
The rst group contains the persistence and the standard deviation of the shock processes.
In line with previous studies, we assume that the persistence of the AR(1) shock processes
follow Beta distribution because this distribution is the most suitable for parameters taking
values between zero and one. The standard deviation of this distribution is harmonized
across di¤erent shocks and it is set at 0.01 while the mean of the distribution di¤ers
across shocks. Since the transitory technology shock is documented in the literature as
persistent (e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2007; Chang and Fernandez, 2009; Garcia-Cicco et
al., 2010), we set the mean of the distribution of a to 0.9; the mean of the persistence of
permanent technology shock, g ; is set at 0.72 since previous estimation results reported in
the RBC literature suggests that it is less persistent than the transitory one; quantitative
macroeconomic literature provides a series of evidences that US and Euro Zone real interest
rates are both highly persistent or they follow an almost random walk process. Uribe and
Yue (2006) estimate an AR(1) process on the 3-month real gross Treasury bill rate and
they obtain a signi cant point estimate of the persistence parameterequal to 0.83. Similarly,
Lubik and Schorfheide (2005) estimate the same parameter and get 0.84 in the case of the
US and 0.83 in the Eurozone. Thus, we set the mean of the distribution of r at 0.8 while

13

the distribution of the persistence of country spread is assumed to have mean 0.65 in line
with the autocorrelation coe¢cient of the EMBI spread reported in the rst section of the
paper.

The distribution of the standard deviation of the shock processes z1=fa ;g ;r ;s g is
considered being the same across di¤erent types of shocks. Generally, in the quantitative
macro literature dealing with Bayesian estimation of DSGE models, standard errors of
shocks are assumed to follow inverse gamma distribution mainly because this is a sensible
distribution to relative shock sizes17 . Moreover, gamma distribution could be another good
candidate for the distribution followed by these standard deviations because it is used in the
case of parameters which take positive values. Thus, we estimate each speci cation of the
model by considering two cases: rst, we assume that the standard deviation of the shocks
follows gamma distribution with mean 0.2 and standard deviation 0.1, while, in the other
case, we consider inverse gamma distribution with mean 0.1 and scale parameter in nity.
The second group of structural parameters consists of those parameters which characterize nancial decisions in the model. These are the elasticities of country spread with respect
to Euro Zone interest rate, r ; and Solow residual, SR . Since with the exception of SR in
the case of Argentina there are no previous evidences concerning the Bayesian estimation
of these parameter we assume that they follow Gamma distribution (i.e. they take positive
values because it is intuitive to assume that country spread increases as Euro Zone interest
rate gets higher or when a negative productivity shock hits the economy) with mean 0.5
and standard deviation 0.1. The mean of the distribution was set based on the observed
correlation coe¢cient between EMBI spread and Euro Zone interest rate, on the one hand,
and EMBI spread and output, on the other hand.
Another nancial parameter of the model is the debt-elastic interest rate parameter,
; which measures the sensitivity of interest rate/country spread to uctuations in external
debt position. This parameter is usually not estimated and is calibrated at 0.001, value
which was proposed by Mendoza (1991) in the case of the Canadian economy. Garcia-Cicco
et al. (2010) are the only authors who estimate this parameter, assuming that it follows
uniform distribution. Thus it is worth to pay particular attention to this parameter and
estimate it because it could easily happen that in the case of emerging economies the data
would attribute a higher value to it. Logically it can be expected that country spread is more
sensitive to movements in debt position in emerging economies than in developed countries;
hence calibrating it to 0.001 would be erroneous. We assume that this parameter follows a
gamma distribution with mean 0.15 and standard deviation 0.05. This is a rather loose prior
17

For a detailed description of the most frequently used distributions in DSGE Bayesian estimation,
advantages and shortcomings of them consult Ermolaev et al. (2008): Estimating GPM with Dynare mimeo.

14

but since there is no previous evidence on estimating it, the prior should take into account
this uncertainty (i.e. this is why the standard deviation of the distribution takes relatively
high value).
Because the capital adjustment cost parameter, ; is a positive parameter it is assumed
to follow a gamma distribution with mean 6 and standard deviation 2.18 This is a somewhat
tighter prior than those assumed by Chang and Fernandez (2009) who estimate  by
considering that it follows a gamma (3,2) distribution in the case of Mexico or Smets and
Wouters (2007) who assume normal (1.25, 0.24) in the case of Eurozone. However, this is
in line with Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010) who consider gamma(8,4) distribution. The working
capital constraint, ; parameter takes values between zero and one, thus we assume that it
follows Beta distribution with mean 0.5 and standard deviation 0.1. The main motivation
for setting the mean of this parameter to 0.5 is provided by the data which suggests that
the cross country average of the short run private credit of non- nancial corporations to
value added ratio is around 0.45. This assumption is similar to those made by Chang and
Fernandez (2009).
Finally there is a set of nonstructural parameters which consists of the standard deviation

of measurement errors z2=fobsY ;obsC ;obsI ;obsT BY g :We estimate the model by assuming that
these parameters follow: inverse gamma with mean 0.02 and scale parameter set to in nity or
gamma distribution with mean 0.02 and standard deviation 0.01. This is a wide prior, but in
this way uncertainty concerning the values of these standard deviations can be incorporated
into the prior knowledge.
We set the algorithm to make one hundred thousand draws19 ; the initial 50% of draws
were dropped out to ensure that the results do not depend on the initial value, and the
scaling parameter in the jumping distribution was ne tuned (around 0.4) such that to
obtain approximately one third acceptance ratio. Moreover, in order to conduct convergence
diagnostic (i.e. ensure that two di¤erent chains converge to the same stationary distribution)
we run two parallel Markov Chains and check the presence of convergence by comparing
recursively computed second order moments20 of the distributions constructed under each
18

We estimated the model by assuming a loose prior for the distribution of  like gamma (3,2) for the rst
time and then we systematically tightened the prior by increasing the mean of the distribution. It turned
out that indi¤erently of how tight or loose the prior is the data and the model had the tendency to push up
the posterior mode of  to values around 6 across all the countries. Hence we set the mean at 6 in order to
obtain a better t.
19
Initially, we set the number of draws to half a million in the MCMH algorithm but due to the robustness
of the optimization method used in the rst step the two chains started to converge fast after 20000 draws.
We checked if this convergence is present in the case of all the ve countries by estimating the Chang and
Fernandez (2009) version of the model with both 100000 and half a million draws. The estimation results
and the convergence statistics con rmed that 100000 draws are enough to achieve convergence.
20
These second order moments are the variance of the distribution, skewness and con dence interval

15

and every draw per chain.
The estimation results can be summarized as follows: (1) The goodness of t statistics
indicate that the speci cation which ts the best the data assumes gamma distribution
for the standard deviations of the shocks, all the observable variables contain measurement
errors and the parameter is estimated in the case of all the ve sampled countries, (2) The
point estimates of suggest that it is erroneous to calibrate the debt elastic interest rate
parameter to 0.001, as proposed by Mendoza (1991) and as it has been used so far in the
literature. The data suggests that, given the considered model setup, varies in [0.02, 0.23]
interval across countries and across di¤erent model speci cations, (3) The posterior means of
the persistence and standard deviation parameters of the shocks are relatively stable across
di¤erent model speci cations, and (4) Financial parameters (like the elasticity of country
spread, working capital constraint or capital adjustment cost parameter) vary slightly across
di¤erent model versions. In addition, a certain degree of heterogeneity in the point estimates
of these nancial parameters can be observed across countries. The rest of this subsection
discusses these results in more details.
When the debt elastic interest rate parameter, ; is not estimated, the estimates of
nancial parameters21 , especially that of the capital adjustment cost parameter changes
signi cantly, as reported in Table C.3. Independently of the model version considered, by
calibrating to 0.001, as proposed by Mendoza (1991), the estimate of the capital adjustment
cost parameter becomes more than double in comparison with the case when is estimated.
In addition, the elasticity of country spread and the working capital constraint parameter
increase.

This result is not counterintuitive at all and it actually underlines the role of capital
adjustment cost in the model. When
is calibrated to a low value relative to what the
data would imply the interest rate is less sensible to large movements in external debt, i.e.
external nancing is relatively cheap. Consequently, agents would like to adjust even more
their capital stock by using besides their own funds more external nancing, generating in
this way higher investment volatility. In order to limit this investment volatility, the cost of
constructed around the parameter mean.
21
For example, the elasticity of country spread with respect to the Solow residual and Euro Zone interest
rate or the working capital constraint parameter.

16

an additional unit of capital accumulated must be higher, i.e. the capital adjustment cost
parameter must increase.
For example, Chang and Fernandez (2009) calibrate instead of estimating it and they
obtain a point estimate of  equal to 14.72 in the case of Argentina. This result is similar
to those we report in Table C.3 suggesting two digit numbers for  across all the countries
when is calibrated. However, when is estimated its point estimates vary in [0.02, 0.23]
interval depending on country, model and prior speci cation. These are somewhat lower
estimates than the equal to 2:8 reported by Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010). This indicates
that the data shifts the posterior mode of the conditional distribution upper, to the right
in the distribution of the parameter, suggesting that the external debt elasticity of country
spread or interest rate in the case of CEECs might be higher than 0.001, i.e. country spread
or interest rate is more sensitive to changes in the external debt position in CEECs than in
developed ones, like Canada.
Regarding the estimates of  reported in Table C.3, one can observe that  takes values
between 3.4 and 8.2 when is estimated. These results are not at odds neither with the
previous evidences in RBC literature nor with the existing empirical evidences obtained
from research on investment behavior. For example Cummins et al. (2006) estimate  by
using cross section data of rms from the US and conclude that the estimated  is about 7.2
in the US. Thus, the estimates of  obtained both in the case of the uniform interest rate
model and the persistent spread model are quite plausible. To motivate lower estimates of
; one can use the gures reported by Aguiar and Gopinath (2007a) who obtain estimates
for  between 2.82 and 3.79 by using moment matching, or those recently documented by
Garcia-Cicco et al. (2010) (i.e. they estimate  at 4.6 in the case of Argentina by using
Bayesian techniques).

1.1. Output: gross domestic product at market prices (B1GM) series
1.2. Consumption: household and NPISH nal consumption expenditure (P31_S14_S15):
1.3. Investment: gross xed capital formation (P51)
1.4. Exports: exports of goods and services (P6)
1.5. Imports: imports of goods and services (P7)
1.6. Trade balance to output ratio: is the ratio between net exports, computed as the
di¤erence between exports of goods and services (P6) and imports of goods and services
17

(P7), and gross domestic product at market prices (B1GM)
weseasonally adjusted of all the above presented series by using Tramo-Seats method
implemented in Demetra 2.1. software package.
Cyclical components (logarithmic deviation from the long run trend) of the seasonally
adjusted output, consumption investment and trade balance to GDP ratio: are computed
in three steps (i) rstly, the above described level series are taken in logarithm (ii) the time
series, obtained in this way, are ltered by using Hodrick-Prescott lter with =1600 scale
parameter (iii) the cyclical component of each series is computed as a di¤erence between the
logged level series and its trend component.
2. Real Euro Zone interest rate (quarterly frequency): is computed as the di¤erence
between the overnight German money market rate and annualized quarterly German ination
rate. The source of the interest rate is the Online Historical Financial Statistics published
by The Deutsche Bundesbank and it is de ned as Frankfurt banks / Overnight money /
Monthly average: SU0101, from which the quarterly series is constructed by taking the
corresponding monthly rate at the end of each quarter. The annualized quarter-to-quarter
ination rate is computed based on the quarterly consumer price index (13464ZF)(2000=100)
from International Financial Statistics of IMF according to the following formula:
inf = 400  ln

3. Country spread (quarterly frequency): is quanti ed by using JP Morgan EMBI Global
Divers-Stripped spread in Poland (JPMGPOC (SSPRD)) covering the period 1995Q1:2009Q4,
in Hungary (JPMGHNC (SSPRD)) over the period 1999Q1:2009Q4 and in Bulgaria (JPMPBUL (BSPRD)), 1994Q3:2009Q4; In order to compute EMBI spread US-dollar denominated
Brady bonds, Eurobonds, and traded loans issued or guaranteed by sovereign entities are
considered. Only issues with a current face amount outstanding of $500 million or more and
a remaining life of greater than 2 1/2 years are eligible for inclusion in the index. 22 Moreover
the yield spread used in the case of Hungary is computed as the absolute di¤erence between
yield on long term Eurobonds issued by the Hungarian government (568915(RYAN)) and
yield on long term US Treasury bonds. (993766(RYAN)) 23 .
4. Compensation of labor input (annual frequency): (i) total compensation of labor
(lab_tot) is obtained from the EU KLEMS database for The Czech Republic, Poland and
Romania. This is computed as the sum of compensation for employees and that part of
the operating surplus/ mixed income which represents the compensation for self-employed

Data concerning mixed income is not available in the case of Bulgaria and Romania (ii)
compensation of employees at industry level published by Eurostat in the National Accounts
by 6 branches at current prices (nama_nace06_c) and de ned as the total remuneration,
in cash or in kind, payable by an employer to an employee in return for work done by the
latter. Social contributions paid by the employer are also included in this indicator.
5. Value added (annual frequency): (i) total value added in the economy (all industries)
at current prices, in millions of euro, is obtained from the EU KLEMS database (va_tot) for
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland; in the case of Bulgaria and Romania the source
of value added is Eurostat (B1G) (ii) industry level value added series, at current prices, in
millions of national currency, are from the National Accounts aggregates and employment
by branch tables (NACE) (nama_nace) published by Eurostat.
6. Private credit of non- nancial corporations (annual frequency): since there are no
publicly available gures concerning the type of loans besides their maturity for the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Romania, short term nancial liabilities (stocks) of non- nancial
corporations in millions of national currency, from the Czech National Banks, the National
Banks of Hungary and the Romanian National Banks Monetary and nancial statistics,
are taken as proxy for working capital loans; working capital loans to non- nancial private
corporations (stocks) in millions of national currency is considered in the case of Poland
published by the National Bank of Poland in the Monetary and nancial statistics: Assets
and liabilities of monetary nancial institutions; Bulgaria: there is no publicly available data.
7. Real GDP growth rate (quarterly frequency): measured as the percentage change of
the gross domestic product at constant prices relative to the previous period from the GDP
and main components-volumes (namq_gdp_k) table published by Eurostat
8. Net Foreign Asset (NFA) position (annual frequency): in millions of US dollars is from
the updated and extended version of dataset constructed by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007)
in the "External Wealth of Nations" Dataset, 1970-2007
9. Gross Domestic Product (annual frequency): is at current prices, in millions of US
dollars from the updated and extended version of dataset constructed by Lane and MilesiFerretti (2007) in the "External Wealth of Nations" Dataset, 1970-200725
10. Employment: (annual frequency): measured as annual average total employment (1564 years, resident population concept - LFS) in thousand of persons from the Employment
(main characteristics and rates) (lfsi_emp_a ) table published by Eurostat.
11. Population: is in thousand of persons and it is obtained from Population, activity
