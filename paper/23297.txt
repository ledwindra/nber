Seeing and Hearing: The Impacts of New York City’s Universal Prekindergarten Program
on the Health of Low-Income Children

ABSTRACT
Prior research suggests that high quality universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) programs can generate
lifetime benefits, but the mechanisms generating these effects are not well-understood. In 2014,
New York City made all 4-year-old children eligible for high-quality UPK programs that
emphasized developmental screening. We examine the effect of this program on the health and
healthcare utilization of children enrolled in Medicaid using a difference-in-regression
discontinuity design that exploits both the introduction of UPK and the fixed age cut-off for
enrollment. The introduction of UPK increased the probability that a child was diagnosed with
asthma or with vision problems, received treatment for hearing or vision problems, or received a
screening during the prekindergarten year. UPK accelerated the timing of diagnoses of vision
problems. We do not find any increases in injuries, infectious diseases, or overall utilization.
These effects are not offset by lower screening rates in the kindergarten year, suggesting that one
mechanism through which UPK might generate benefits is that it accelerates the rate at which
children are identified with conditions that could potentially delay learning and cause behavioral
problems. We do not find significant effects of having a child who was eligible for UPK on
mothers’ health, fertility, or healthcare utilization.

1. Introduction
A growing body of literature suggests that early childhood education improves lifetime
outcomes, especially for disadvantaged children (Heckman, 2011; Muennig, 2015). In response,
many states have expanded funding for pre-kindergarten programs. By the 2014-2015 academic
year, 42 states and District of Columbia had established state funded pre-K programs serving 4year-olds. Across the nation 1.2 million 4-year-old children, who account for about 30% of the
total population of 4-year-old children, were enrolled in a state funded pre-K program (Barnett et
al., 2016).
While evidence for the long-term benefits of preschool is strong, it is more challenging to
identify how these benefits are achieved. Many studies find that pre-K programs improve
children’s academic skills (literacy, language and math), cognition, and test scores (Weiland and
Yoshikawa, 2013; Gormley and Gayer, 2005; Fitzpartick, 2008; Lipsey et al., 2013; Wong et al.,
2008; Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013; Hill, Gormley, and Adelstein, 2015; Gormley, Phillips,
and Gayer, 2008) in the short run, but often find these effects fade out over time. Studies also
find that these programs increase the frequency of screenings for developmental delays and
chronic conditions (Zigler, Piotrkowski, and Collins, 1994; Janvier et al., 2016), which may
enable better outcomes in subsequent years. However, studies of early childhood programs also
find that early exposure to other children may have deleterious effects. Some studies find that
children who attended such programs may be more aggressive and have lower self-control at
school entry (Magnuson, Ruhm, and Waldfogel, 2007; Baker, Gruber, and Milligan, 2008).
One of the greatest challenges to studies of pre-K programs has been the heterogeneity of
program components and quality (D’Onise et al., 2015). Many of the programs that have
generated evidence of long-term effects are of higher quality than the typical program in the field
1

today. Current spending per child in pre-K averages only about $4,500 (Barnett et al., 2016,
measured as 2015 dollars), less than half the $11,009 spent on public education per pupil across
the US (U.S. Census Bureau, Annual Survey of School System Finances). Many high-quality
programs are very small. Inconsistency in policy and program implementation, as well as the
very small sample sizes of many of these evaluations, may be responsible for contradictory or
null results (Cohen and Syme, 2013; D’Onise et al., 2015; Rossin-Slater, 2015).
The introduction of universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) in New York City, the nation’s largest
school system, offers an opportunity to assess how a high quality UPK program affects health
outcomes in the short-run. The substantial size of the program; the design and financing of the
program which suggest that it offers care of relatively high quality; and the timing of the roll-out
make the NYC case a valuable case-study.
As with other US UPK programs, New York’s program is currently voluntary. This means
that enrolled children may differ from those whose parents choose other options. An analysis that
does not take into account the endogeneity of enrollment is likely to lead to biased results
(Gormley and Gayer, 2005; Lipsey et al., 2015). We overcome the threat of endogenous
enrollment in pre-K programs by using an age-cutoff regression discontinuity design (RDD),
coupled with a difference-in-differences analysis. We take advantage of the strict age cutoff for
UPK eligibility in NYC, which is December 31st, and divide the population of children into a
treatment group who were born before the cutoff date and a control group who were born after
the cutoff date of birth. The regression discontinuity design addresses the endogeneity of
participation, but the trajectory of development at early ages is so steep that children just below
the cutoffs are likely to be quite different developmentally than those just above the cutoff. To
address this concern, we adopt a difference-in-regression-discontinuity design (DRD), by which

2

we identify the effect of UPK program as the difference between the estimated effects on health
of an RDD around the age cutoff for the year before the UPK expansion and an RDD around the
age cutoff for the year after the UPK expansion.1
Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, while most of the existing
literature on UPK programs focuses on school readiness, we examine the effect of a high-quality
UPK program on a range of short-run health outcomes during the pre-K year and in the
Kindergarten year. We focus on low-income children who are enrolled in Medicaid, a group that
is the target for most UPK programs.2,3 Second, the large-scale UPK program in NYC, with
clear guidance and regulation, provides us with evidence from a relatively homogenous, highquality program, as well as a large data set. Third, we adopt a difference-in-regressiondiscontinuity design to identify plausibly causal effects.
We find that the NYC UPK program led to increases in rates of diagnosis of asthma and vision
problems, to increased rates of screening for immunization or infectious disease, and to increased
rates of treatment of hearing and vision problems. UPK eligibility (attendance) increased the
probabilities of being diagnosed with asthma and vision problems by 1.3 (3.8) and 1.9 (5.6)
percentage points respectively, and the probabilities of receiving treatment of hearing and vision
problems and immunization or infectious disease screening by 0.9 (2.6), 2.2 (6.5) and 2.5 (7.4)
percentage points respectively. Our findings indicate that UPK might work by accelerating the
rate at which children are identified with conditions that could potentially delay learning and
cause behavioral problems. By contrast, we do not find significant effects of a child’s UPK

Smith (2015) uses a similar approach to estimate the effects of a pre-K program on adult criminal activity.
Zerpa (2016) examines the effects of pre-K programs on various health outcomes 1-8 years after pre-K, exploiting
variation in the timing of the implementation of pre-K programs across states. She finds increases in health problems
in the first four years after preschool for both boys and girls.

Cascio (2017) studies the effects of pre-K programs on test scores for low-income children. She finds that
universal pre-K programs have positive effects on reading and math scores of low-income 4 year olds, but pre-K
programs targeted toward disadvantaged children have no effect on low-income children.

2. Institutional Background and Data Description
NYC’s UPK Program
Since 1998 New York City has had a publicly financed pre-K program for which all four-yearold in New York City are eligible. However, due to funding limitations, the program served only
a small share of the eligible population. In 2013, NYC’s pre-K program enrolled 19,483 children
in full-day programs and 39,045 in part-day programs, accounting for just 18% and 37% of the
total eligible population respectively (Potter, 2015).
In 2013, following the election of Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York City designed and
implemented a universal pre-kindergarten policy called “Pre-K For All,” with the goal of
providing every child in New York City with a seat in a pre-kindergarten free of charge. The
rollout of this UPK policy was to be completed in two stages: a portion of the seats would be
made available in September 2014, and the policy would be fully implemented by September
2015 with a full-day pre-kindergarten seat available for each eligible child. Data from December
2015 indicate that NYC’s UPK policy increased the number of eligible New York City children
enrolled in full-day pre-kindergarten rapidly and substantially -- from 19,483 in September 2013
(the year prior to the UPK policy rollout) to 53,000 in September 2014 and 68,000 in September
2015, which is roughly the same number of students as are enrolled in public (district and
charter) kindergarten, suggesting nearly universal take-up for the public school population
(Potter, 2015).4
To be eligible for NYC’s UPK program, a child must reside in New York City and be between
4

According to the U.S. Census Bureau there are about 115,000 four-year olds in NYC. The 40% of 4- year olds
outside the UPK program are children who may attend private or parochial pre-kindergartens or who do not attend a
formal pre-kindergarten.

3 years and 8 months of age and 4 years and 8 months of age at the start of the academic year—
that is, children born in 2010 were eligible to begin pre-K in 2014, and children born in 2011
were eligible to begin pre-K in 2015. The NYC Department of Education could not guarantee
placement for all children in the 2014 phase. In 2015, in line with the goal of the policy, all
applicants were guaranteed placement at an NYC pre-kindergarten, although the location was not
necessarily their first choice.5
Institutions offering pre-K in NYC can be district schools, charter schools or NYC early
childhood centers. All programs are required to comply with the licensing and permitting
requirements of their Licensing Agency, the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB), and the Fire
Department of New York (FDNY). All staff members must meet the health requirements of the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) and the New York City Department of
Education (NYCDOE), and meet all qualification and certification requirements. All students
must be immunized in accordance with New York Public Health Law §2164 and the
requirements of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), which includes
specific requirements about toileting training and sanitary practices such as handwashing.
Adequate, safe, clean and well-maintained facilities, instructional materials and furniture are also
required in and out of the classroom. There are also strict guidelines for class size and staff to
student ratios. Class sizes are capped at 20, with one trained early childhood teacher and one
program assistant in each class. Finally, all programs are required to use a valid and reliable
developmental screening tool to identify students with potential developmental delays and
English Language Acquisition support needs, and they must perform this screening within the
first 45 days of enrollment. Note that all children enrolled in NYC public schools must undergo

In 2015, about 70% of the applicants got their most preferred location and 82% were placed in one of their top
three choices (Harris, 2015).

immunizations and clinician (not school) – administered developmental screenings prior to
starting Kindergarten. In addition, the NYC UPK program cost more than twice as much per
pupil as the national average and has been lauded for its exceptionally high quality (Kirp, 2016).
In the 2014-2015 academic year, among the 53,000 enrolled UPK students, 12.9% were Asian,
30.0% were black, 37.1% were Hispanic, 16.5% were white, and 3.5% belonged to other races.
This pattern was similar to that of those enrolled in public kindergarten in NYC. About threequarters of UPK students attended at a school/center that had more than three-fourths students
receiving free and reduced-price lunch. About 67% of UPK students were enrolled in a program
in a neighborhood with below-median average family income (Potter, 2015).
Data
Our data are drawn from the complete NYC Medicaid utilization files for academic years
2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016. We focus on children who were born between January
2008 and December 2012, and were enrolled in Medicaid in September of each relevant
academic year.6 Figure 1 documents the time scheme of the observations related to the initial
expansion of UPK in 2014. In the 2013-2014 academic year (pre-UPK), children born in 2008
were eligible for kindergarten, children born in 2009 were eligible for existing pre-K programs,
and children born in 2010 and 2011 were too young to be eligible for pre-K. After the expansion,
in academic year 2014-2015, children born in 2010 became eligible for the UPK program, while
those born in 2011 were too young and those born in 2008 and 2009 were too old to be eligible
for the UPK program. The timing of observations allows us to compare outcomes in academic
year 2014-2015 between either 1) children born in 2009 and 2010 (panel (a) of Figure 1), or 2)
children born in 2010 and 2011 (panel (b) of Figure 1).

6

About 3-4% of the children who satisfy those conditions churned off and on Medicaid during the following
academic year. In Appendix C, we show that such attrition is not a concern for our main findings.

Note: (a) There were existing pre-K programs (non-universal) in NYC before the expansion in 2014.

We exclude children who were not eligible for NYC’s pre-K program because of residency.7
In total there are 65,678, 64,221, 65,863, 65,085, 65,082, 65,587, 64,739, 65,127, 64,431, 64,917
and 65,791 children who were enrolled in Medicaid during the follow-up period and were born
in 2008 (for the 2013-2014 academic year), 2008 (for the 2014-2015 academic year), 2009 (for
the 2013-2014 academic year), 2009 (for the 2014-2015 academic year), 2009 (for the 20152016 academic year), 2010 (for the 2013-2014 academic year), 2010 (for the 2014-2015
academic year), 2010 (for the 2015-2016 academic year), 2011 (for the 2014-2015 academic
year), 2011 (for the 2015-2016 academic year) and 2012 (for the 2015-2016 academic year)
respectively.

To be eligible for NYC’s pre-K program, a child needs the proof of residency when apply. The proof has to be
recent within 60 to 90 days, depending on the document (utility bill, lease agreement, property tax bill, etc.). In our
sample, we only include the children who lived in NYC from March through September of the year when the
children became eligible.

academic years (September – June) corresponding to Figure 1, for both rollouts in 2014 and
2015. We focus on health outcomes that are most likely to be affected by UPK. These include
injuries and infectious diseases, which may increase because of exposure to other children;
immunizations and infectious disease screenings and regular checkups, which may be required
for school attendance; and diagnosis and treatment of chronic conditions that may be initially
identified by UPK staff (asthma, hearing and vision problems, developmental delays, ADHD,
anxiety disorder). We also include a measure of overall Medicaid expenditures, to capture other
diagnoses and conditions.
There are no striking differences in the observed demographic characteristics across the three
cohorts. The treatment group (children born in 2010) and the control group (children born in
either 2009 or 2011) for the initial UPK expansion in 2014 differ in several health and utilization
indicators during academic year 2014-2015, after the introduction of UPK. However, many of
these differences also exist in the prior year (before UPK). There are some marked differences
among children by age. For example, older children are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma,
vision problems and mental problems (ADHD and anxiety disorders) and to receive treatments
for vision problems, and are less likely to be diagnosed with hearing problems, developmental
delay and to have had a routine checkup.

For children born in 2009 and 2010, the relationship between our 2014-2015 outcome
measures and the introduction of UPK can be modeled as:

(ITT) effect of the introduction of UPK on health and utilization indicator

The unobserved determinants of the health outcome may be correlated with child’s age, as
indicated in Table 1. If that is the case, a simple OLS estimation of equation (1) leads to a biased
estimate of . To address this problem, we take advantage of the UPK eligibility rules in an agecutoff RDD approach. To be eligible for the pre-K program starting in September, children must
be at least 3 years and 8 months old at the beginning of that year. For example, only children
who were born from January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2010 were eligible to participate in
UPK in September 2014. We keep in the sample children who were born in a small window
close to the cutoff of December 31st, e.g., a 60-day bandwidth, and estimate the following (sharp)

An alternative approach to this problem would be to use a difference-in-differences (DID)

approach. We estimate the following DID by adding outcomes in the 2013-2014 academic year
for children born in 2008 and 2009 as the baseline:8

is the health and utilization indicator, which is

measured during the 2013-2014 academic year for children born in 2008 and 2009, and during
the 2014-2015 academic year for children born in 2009 and 2010. 1

2014 is an indicator

for the 2014-2015 academic year. It equals one if the observation comes from the 2014-2015
academic year (post-UPK). The indicator equals to zero if the observation comes from the 20132014 academic year before the UPK expansion (pre-UPK).9
The ITT effect of the UPK is identified as

in equation (3), which is the difference between

the average effects of UPK on the 2010 cohort (compared with the 2009 cohort) and the 2009
cohort (compared with the 2008 cohort). To interpret

as a causal effect, we make a “common

trend” assumption: without the expansion of UPK, the observed differences in the 2014-2015
academic year between children born in 2010 and 2009 would be the same as the differences in
the 2013-2014 academic year between children born in 2009 and 2008.
In our setting, the RDD and the DID approaches alone may not work well. Even children
within a small neighborhood around the cutoff can be quite different because of the steep
developmental trajectory at early ages, making the RDD approach problematic, since health
outcomes may not go across the cutoff smoothly. The common trend assumption in the DID
approach may not hold as there could be other relevant policy changes at the same time as UPK
expansion. To address these possibilities, we combine the RDD approach with the DID approach
8
We don’t add the outcomes in the 2013-2014 academic year for the same cohorts (the children born in 2009 and
2010) as the baseline because we want to have the outcomes measured at the same age in the treatment or control
group. This makes the two “differences” comparable.
9
Equivalently, the indicator 1
2014 also indicates that the comparison is between the child born in 2009 and
2010, which uses the outcomes measured in the 2014-2015 academic year.

12

to get a difference-in-regression-discontinuity design (DRD). The DRD approach accounts for
the potential relative pre-existing differences at the cutoff of the standard RDD and other policy
changes. Specifically, we estimate the following DRD:
1

1

1

2014

1
1

1

2014

2014

,

(4)

where all of the variables are defined in the same way as equation (3). Using the DRD
specification, we estimate the effects of UPK at two cutoffs simultaneously (
of December 31st, 2009, and
identified as

for the cutoff

for the cutoff of December 31st, 2008). The ITT effect of UPK is

in equation (4) as the difference between these two effects at the eligibility

cutoffs. We can now interpret

as a causal effect under a much weaker “common trend”

assumption: without the expansion of UPK, the observed differences in the 2014-2015 academic
year between children born in a small neighborhood around December 31st, 2009, would be the
same as the differences in the 2013-2014 academic year between children born in a small
neighborhood around December 31st, 2008. 10 It seems very plausible that this common trend
holds when we restrict the comparison to the children with ages around the cutoffs.
The effect identified by equation (4) as described above is the effect for the oldest children
relative to their cohorts in the same grade, as they are the only group that were eligible for UPK
after the expansion in 2014 (see panel (a) of Figure 1). The other three groups were too old to be
eligible for UPK in the 2014-2015 academic year. We can also obtain the effect for the youngest
children relative to their cohorts in the same grade by estimating the same equation (4) but using
the outcomes in the 2013-2014 academic year for the children born in 2009 and 2010, and the
outcomes in the 2014-2015 academic year for the children born in 2010 and 2011. The estimated
10

Alternatively, the assumption can be interpreted from the RDD perspective: conditional on pre-existing
differences in health outcomes, all health determinates (observed or unobserved) except for the eligibility status,
evolves smoothly with respect to age (birth date) around the cutoff.

13

effect is the effect for the youngest children relative to their cohorts in the same grade because
again they are the only group that were eligible for UPK in the 2014-2015 academic year (see
panel (b) of Figure 1). Finally, we can also pool the estimation samples together to obtain the
averaged total effect for the oldest and the youngest children, by adding a sample fixed effect to
equation (4). The specification is the following:
1

(5)
where

is the sample fixed effect indicating that the observation comes from the sample for the

oldest children, corresponding to panel (a) in Figure 1. All other variables and parameters are the
same as equation (4).

4. Empirical Results
Graphical Analysis
In Appendix A, Figure A1 illustrates how health outcomes and healthcare utilization in the
2013-2014 and the 2014-2015 academic years change by age relative to the cutoffs, which are
December 31st, 2008 for children born in 2008 and 2009 (before the UPK expansion), and
December 31st, 2009 for children born in 2009 and 2010 (after the UPK expansion), respectively.
We observe discontinuities in most of the examined health outcomes and healthcare utilizations,
but for most outcomes we also observe similar patterns before the UPK expansion.11

11

For example, compared with children around the cutoff who are ineligible for the UPK expansion in 2014,
marginally eligible children are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma, hearing and vision problems, and to get
treatment for hearing and vision problems. They are less likely to get injury and to be diagnosed with ADHD and
anxiety disorder.

14

Difference-in-Regression-Discontinuity Design
The DRD approach allows for the existence of differences before the treatment, and imposes a
“common trend” assumption that such difference would remain the same if the treatment had not
been implemented, but only for the children around the cutoffs.12 We estimate equations (4) and
(5) using children born in a 120-day window around the cutoff.13 Table 2 report the estimation
results for both the oldest and the youngest children, and the pooled sample.14
We find few impacts of UPK on health diagnoses and utilization indicators with three
exceptions. Eligible children are about 2 percentage points more likely to have a diagnosis of
vision problems recorded, for both the oldest children and the youngest children. They are more
likely to have had a diagnosis of asthma recorded (1.3 percentage points for the oldest children,
2.1 percentage points for the youngest children). They are more likely to receive treatment for
hearing problems (about 1 percentage point) and vision problems (about 2 percentage points for
both the oldest and the youngest children). They are also more likely to have had an
immunization or infectious disease screening (5.4 percentage points for the oldest children, 2.9
percentage points for the youngest children).

12

For the purpose of comparison, we conduct conventional regression discontinuity design (RDD) and differencein-differences (DID) approaches in Appendix B.
13
We also check that whether our results are sensitive to model choice by re-estimating the model using a logit
model for binary outcomes. While not shown here, the results from this alternative specification are largely
consistent with our main results. The estimation results from the logit model are available upon request.
14
A potential threat to the common trend assumption of DRD would be perfect manipulation of birth date. It may
be possible in a few cases for parents to choose whether a baby is delivered on December 31st or January 1st, but
very few Medicaid parents are likely to have manipulated birthdate in this way. We formally examine whether there
is any evidence of manipulation by displaying the distribution of birthdate observed in our data. Figure A2 in
Appendix A is a histogram that shows the distributions of children by date of birth around the four cutoffs
(December 31st of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011). There is clearly no evidence of manipulation around the cutoffs. The
date of birth follows an approximately uniform distribution within the 120-day window around the cutoff.

5. Robustness checks and Interpretations
Robustness Checks with Alternative Bandwidths and Specifications
In our main analysis, we use a 60-day bandwidth around the cutoff. We also check whether
our results are robust to alternative bandwidths: 15 days, 30 days, 90 days, 120 days, outcome16

specific IK optimal bandwidth (Imbens and Kalyanaraman, 2011) and CCT optimal bandwidth
(Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik, 2014). In Appendix D, Table D1 presents the estimation
results of the total effects from different bandwidths. Overall our estimated effects are robust to
the choice of bandwidth. We also check whether our main results are robust to different
specifications. We re-estimate equation (5) controlling for quadratic or cubic piece-wise
polynomial of the forcing variable, for both local and global estimations. The results are
presented in Table D2 in Appendix D. Overall, our main results, are robust to model
specifications. Finally, we check to see whether our results hold over a full year (rather than an
academic year). These results are presented in Table D3 in Appendix D. Again, the results are
robust to this alternative specification. In Table D3 we also check whether our results hold for
the first half (September to December) of an academic year. Overall the results are robust, except
for smaller (but still significant) effects on vision problems and treatments and an insignificant
effect on hearing treatment.
Heterogenous Effects by Gender and Ethnicity
The existing literature suggests that boys and girls benefit differently from pre-K programs
(Zerpa, 2016). The effects of pre-K may also differ by ethnicity. To explore potential
heterogeneous effects by gender and ethnicity, we re-estimate the main model by demographic
groups separately. Table 3 summarizes the estimation results for the pooled sample.
Notably, the findings for immunizations and screenings hold similarly for boys and girls and
are statistically comparable across all race/ethnicity groups. By contrast, diagnoses of asthma
are concentrated among boys and among Hispanics. Treatment of vision problems increases for
both boys and girls, and more among Hispanics than among other groups, while the effect of
UPK on treatment for hearing problems is greater among boys and Whites.

Effect of the Expansion in 2015
In 2015 there was a smaller, second expansion of UPK. The number of enrollees increased
from 53,000 in September 2014 to 68,000 in September 2015. We next test the robustness of our
results using this second year expansion. Figure 2 shows the timing of observations for the 1st18

year effect in 2015, which is similar with Figure 1 for the 1st-year effect in 2014. We use the
same specification to estimate the effects of the 1st-year effect in 2015, except that we continue
to compare to the non-universal pre-K before the expansion in 2014.
Figure 2: Timing of Observations, 1st-Year Effect in 2015
(a) Oldest children (born on January 1st, 2011)

(b) Youngest children (born on December 31st, 2011)

Note: (a) There were existing pre-K programs (non-universal) in NYC before the expansion in 2014.

Table 4 summarizes the estimated effects for the oldest, youngest and pooled samples. We
find some variation in effects – asthma is no longer significant, while infectious disease
diagnoses increase. The effects on immunizations and screening, diagnosis of vision problems,
and treatment of hearing and vision problems, however, remain quite consistent across the two
years and are larger in magnitude in the second comparison (where more students are enrolled in
UPK). Taking into account that the second expansion enrolled more students, the TOT effects
are also consistent across the two years, as shown later in section 7.

6. Effects over Time
Virtually all children enrolled in UPK who remain living in NYC progress to Kindergarten a
year later. Asthma and hearing and vision problems tend to be chronic conditions. In the
absence of UPK, children might have been diagnosed with these conditions a year later, when
they entered kindergarten. To assess these possibilities, we follow the oldest children and
20

analyze whom we can follow through their entry into kindergarten in the 2015-2016 academic
year, the year following UPK.
Timing of Treatments of Sensory Problems
UPK may help accelerate identification and treatment sensory problems that affect children’s
learning and developments at an earlier stage. Specifically, we model the hazard of first
treatment by the following Cox proportional hazards model:

is the effect of UPK on the hazard of the first treatment of sensory problems. In our sample,
the most common treatments of hearing problems are removing impacted cerumen (40%) and
speech/hearing therapy (28%), and the major treatments of vision problems are eye exam to
evaluate problems (55%) and purchase of frames (26%). Figure 3 compares the estimated
Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard of first treatment for the age-eligible and non-age-eligible
groups, before and after the expansion of UPK.

A detailed discussion about incorporating RDD to a survival analysis framework can be found in Bor et al., (2014).
The Cox proportional hazards model does not allow for omitting important explanatory variables, no matter whether
they are endogenous or not. In Appendix E we re-estimate the impact via accelerated failure-time (AFT) models that
allow for omitted explanatory variables. The results show that our findings are robust to omitted explanatory
variables.

Note: The polynomial lines represent local mean smoothing of the estimated Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard of the
first treatment, starting from 2-year old and using a bandwidth of 0.1 years. We do not have hazard of the first
treatment for the total sample after age 5.3 because thereafter the data for the youngest children becomes
unavailable.

Panel (a) and (b) compare the cumulative hazard of the first treatment of hearing problems.
We find little effect of the introduction of UPK on the pattern of hearing treatment of ageeligible children relative to non-eligible children. Panel (c) and (d) compare the cumulative
hazard of the first treatment of vision problems. Before the expansion there is almost no
difference in the hazard between the age-eligible and non-age-eligible groups. After the
22

expansion, there is still no initial difference in treatment until about age 4 (the entry age for
UPK), after which we observe significantly higher hazard for the eligible children. Overall UPK
significantly increases the hazard of the first treatment of vision problems between ages 4 and 5.
Details about the survival analysis can be found in Appendix E.16
Utilization During the Kindergarten Year
Utilization of diagnostic and treatment services in the pre-kindergarten year may be offset by
lower rates of use of these services during the kindergarten year. To assess this, we directly
examine utilization of services in the kindergarten year (second year effects of UPK). Figure 4
shows the timeline for the analysis of the second-year effects. Again, as in panel (a) of Figure 1,
children born after January 1st, 2010 are the only group that is eligible for the expanded UPK. All
the outcomes are measured in the second year after the UPK year, so the children are in either
grade 1 or kindergarten, and aged 6 or 5.17
Figure 4: Timing of Observations, Second-Year Effect

There is considerable persistence in diagnoses from the UPK to the kindergarten year. Table 5
shows the persistence of diagnoses in the UPK cohort and the control cohort.

16

While not shown there, the effect of UPK between age 5 and 6, which is basically for the oldest children, is not
statistically significant for either hearing or vision treatments.
17
We can’t estimate second-year effect for the youngest children because in their case the comparison group,
which was too young to be eligible for the UPK at the time of expansion, has become eligible for pre-K.

Note: The table shows the percentage of children with the corresponding diagnose in kindergarten year, among the
children in the 120-day window with the same diagnose in pre-K year. For example, among all children born in
November and December of 2009 with (without) asthma in pre-K year (2013-2014 academic year), 65.5% (7.1%)
were diagnosed with asthma in kindergarten year (2014-2015 academic year).

Table 6 present the estimation results for the second academic year in kindergarten. We
observe no offsetting reductions in the diagnosis of asthma, hearing or vision problems and any
immunization or infectious disease screening over the total sample. We next estimate the same
DRD model for those children who had diagnoses or treatments in the pre-K year to assess
whether earlier diagnoses were more likely to be spurious or offset under the UPK regime. We
find evidence that treatment of hearing problems diagnosed in the pre-K year is more likely to
continue among the children exposed to UPK, and that children who had an immunization or
screening service in pre-K under the UPK regime were less likely to have one in the subsequent
year, but we find no other offsetting reductions in diagnosis or treatment in this group.

7. Implied Treatment-on-Treated (TOT) Effect
Our analyses provide estimates of the ITT effect of UPK, which provides insights about the
effect of UPK policy. In comparing these results with prior studies of the effects of early
childhood education, it is useful to construct TOT estimates, which measure the effect of
participation in UPK. We are not able to directly estimate the TOT effect because we do not
25

have actual enrollment data, but we can calculate the approximate TOT effects implied by our
estimated ITT effect using enrollment information from other sources.
The TOT effect can be calculated by dividing the estimated ITT effect by the change in the
pre-K enrollment rate of four-year-old children enrolled in Medicaid during the first year after
the UPK expansion. The overall change in the pre-K enrollment rate for NYC from 2013-2014 to
2014-2015 was about 32% (Potter, 2015). The increase is likely to have been larger for our
sample of Medicaid enrollees: one estimate shows the change in the pre-K enrollment rate for the
bottom two quintiles of the household income distribution between 2013 and 2014 was about
34% (University of California, Berkeley. Institute of Human Development, 2015). Using this
figure, our TOT estimate suggests that for those compliers who would attend UPK if eligible and
would not attend UPK if not eligible, attending UPK increases the probability of being diagnosed
with asthma by 3.8 percentage points, the probability of being diagnosed with vision problems
by 5.6 percentage points, and the likelihood of receiving an immunization or infectious disease
screening by 7.4 percentage points. The probabilities of receiving hearing and vision treatments
increase by 2.6 and 6.5 percentage points among those attending UPK. Relative to the baseline
rates reported in Table 1, these constitute treatment increases of 63% and 45% respectively.
For the second expansion in 2015, the change in the pre-K enrollment rate for the bottom two
quintiles of the household income distribution between 2013 and 2015 was about 51% (Shapiro
and Cheney, 2015; University of California, Berkeley. Institute of Human Development, 2015).
Our TOT estimate suggests that the 2015 expansion increases the probability of vision problem
diagnosis, receiving hearing treatment and vision treatment by 4.7, 3.1 and 5.3 percentage points,
respectively. The 2015 expansion increases the probability of receiving immunization and
infectious disease diagnosis by 3.9 and 3.3 percentage points.

8. Effect on Mothers’ Health
A potential channel for the UPK to affect children’s health is mothers’ health. The existing
literature provides some evidence about how early child care affects maternal health and wellbeing. The introduction of subsidized universal child care in Quebec, Canada, led to worse
parental health (Baker, Gruber, and Milligan, 2008; Brodeur and Connolly, 2013; Kottelenberg
and Lehrer, 2013), higher maternal depression and lower-quality parental relationships (Baker,
Gruber, and Milligan, 2008; Kottelenberg and Lehrer, 2013). Using data from the Child Care and
Development Fund (CCDF) in the United States, Herbst and Tekin (2014) find that mothers who
receive child care subsidies report lower health and are more likely to have mental health
problems such as anxiety and depression. A study on public day care in Germany found that it
led to worse maternal physical condition (Kröll and Borck, 2013), higher family life satisfaction
(Schober and Stahl, 2016; Schober and Schmitt, 2013) and higher fertility (Bauernschuster,
Hener, and Rainer, 2013).
We adopt the same age-eligibility difference-in-regression discontinuity design (DRD,
equation (5)) to analyze the impact of a child’s UPK eligibility on indicators of mothers’ health,
fertility and health care utilization. The estimate results are presented in Table 7. We report
results separately for all mothers, and also for those for whom the UPK eligible child is the
youngest in the household. Overall we do not find significant effects of UPK on mothers whose
children are eligible, except for a weak positive effect on the probability of MD visit for the
mothers whose eligible children are not the youngest in the household.

9. Conclusion
Existing studies find that pre-K is an effective way to boost children’s development, especially
cognition and academic performance (Weiland and Yoshikawa, 2013; Gormley and Gayer, 2005;
Fitzpartick, 2008; Lipsey et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2008; Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013; Hill,
Gormley, and Adelstein, 2015; Gormley, Phillips, and Gayer, 2008). This evidence supports the
premise that a pre-K program’s key outcome is to increase readiness for kindergarten and the
schooling that follows (Pianta, Cox, and Snow, 2007). Our study examines another potential

28

channel through which pre-K may boost long-term academic, social, and economic life chances
through the early detection and treatment of sensory problems and other chronic conditions such
as asthma that could interfere with a child’s ability to thrive in academic settings.
This study used Medicaid data from New York City to estimate the effect of UPK eligibility
on short-run health and healthcare utilization outcomes. Using a difference-in-regressiondiscontinuity design, we find that children who were eligible for the UPK program were more
likely to have been diagnosed with asthma and vision problems, and to have had treatments for
hearing or vision problems and an immunization or screening for an infectious disease during the
pre-K year. Relative to baseline rates for these outcomes, our TOT effects show a more than
doubling of rates of hearing and vision treatments. We find no offsetting reductions in diagnosis
or treatment rates during the subsequent kindergarten year, suggesting that these screenings are
catching problems earlier than would otherwise have been the case. In contrast to many papers
in the literature which find negative effects of publicly-subsidized childcare on mother’s health,
we do not find significant effects – either positive or negative – of UPK on mothers’ health,
fertility or health care utilization.
Our findings provide insight into one potential pathway through which pre-K could eventually
lead to positive long-run outcomes, which is a process not yet well-understood. To date, research
on the effects of pre-K attendance has largely followed two threads. The first has shown that
many of the short-run cognitive advantages that children attending pre-K enjoy disappear within
the first years of elementary school, as the children who did not attend pre-K “catch up” to those
who did (Duncan and Magnuson, 2013; Magnuson, Ruhm, and Waldfogel, 2007). The second
thread has demonstrated that, despite this, certain long-term advantages of pre-K attendance
persist into adolescence and adulthood – for example, increased likelihood of obtaining a job or

29

securing higher earnings, and decreased likelihood of teen pregnancy or depression (Heckman,
2011; Muennig, 2011). That is, while the cognitive benefits of pre-K may not persist in the longterm, some of the behavioral or social benefits do. Our findings provide evidence for one avenue
by which pre-K might lead to these long-term advantages: by diagnosing and treating chronic
health problems early in children’s educational trajectories, they might develop skills that enable
them to take advantage of the educational opportunities to a greater extent, cope with challenges,
feel less frustrated or overwhelmed in the classroom, and communicate with peers and educators
more effectively. If a young student’s health conditions are well-managed—particularly sensory
problems that could impede learning—then the child may have the chance to develop successful
long-term learning strategies or problem-solving capacities in comparison to a child who remains
burdened by undetected or poorly-managed conditions early in their education.
One of our most robust findings in this study pertains to the increases in the diagnosis and
treatment of vision and hearing problems. Vision problems are prevalent among children in poor
urban environments (Gould and Gould, 2003) and are correlated with low academic performance
at exams (Krumholtz, 2000). In a literature review, Basch (2011) asserts that school-based vision
screening is an effective approach to detect and treat vision problems that are highly and
disproportionately prevalent among school-aged urban minority youth. In our sample, about 85%
of the vision treatments are for refraction evaluations or glasses fittings, which help children see
clearly. Untreated vision problems may also lead to social or emotional problems (Zaba, 2001;
Johnson et al., 1996). In an academic context, students may become frustrated or unable to
engage in a classroom setting to the fullest extent. Poor eyesight is incompatible with a learning
environment, and in the long-run, untreated poor eyesight and the associated low educational
attainment have negative impacts on quality of life and economic standing (Polack et al., 2008;

30

Rein, et al. 2006). The proactive diagnosis and treatment of vision problems among pre-K
children may provide them with early advantages for succeeding in social environments that in
turn shape their life down the line.
In general, hearing problems are likely to be diagnosed before ages 3-4, which is prior to the
age at which the children would start pre-K. Although our results show no impact on diagnosis
of hearing problems, we do find that the UPK policy leads to higher probability of receiving
treatment for hearing problems. Prior research has suggested that hearing problems may
negatively impact academic performance, self-esteem, and social functioning (Daud et al., 2010;
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2017; Theunissen et al, 2014) and that early
intervention is essential for closing the developmental gap (Mellon et al., 2009). In fact, students
who are treated for hearing problems in childhood and receive school-based support can develop
communication skills on par with or above their healthy peers by adolescence (Eriks-Brophy et
al., 2012). Our results support the idea that pre-K enhances children’s chances for accessing such
treatments and interventions earlier than they otherwise might, which can close this
developmental gap as early as possible.
While more research on long-term effect of pre-K program is called for, we argue that future
studies should also be conducted in fields outside of education. For instance, our use of health
utilization and outcome data in this study provided an opportunity to understand how detection
and treatment of medical problems may play a role in the success of children eligible for pre-K
programs. In turn, these findings may help bridge the gap in the current understanding of how
pre-K imparts social and economic benefits many years later. This study does have limitations,
particularly in our ability to generalize outside of the NYC Medicaid population. All subjects in
this analysis came from low-income families enrolled in the Medicaid program, and it is possible

31

that UPK eligibility would lead to different outcomes for children in other economic situations,
such as the uninsured or privately-insured. Further, our intent-to-treat design provides a
conservative estimate of effect size, as we do not know which specific children actually attended
pre-K. Rather, we only know who was eligible to attend, and therefore children who did not
actually participate in the expansion have been included here. While we did use available
enrollment estimates to calculate TOT estimates, future studies could continue to investigate the
effects of actual pre-K attendance and exploit other sources of variation – such as the varying
quality of the programs offered – in estimating the effect of UPK policies on young children.

Note: The outcomes before (after) the expansion are the health and healthcare utilization indicators measured in the
2013-2014 (2014-2015) academic year, conditional on age relative to the cutoff of December 31st, 2008 (2009). The
polynomial lines represent local mean smoothing of residuals from a regression of the outcome or utilization on
fixed effects that indicates whether the observation is in the sample for the oldest children, conditional on age and
using a bandwidth of 36 days.

B. Regression Discontinuity Design and Difference-in-Differences
An RDD produces unbiased estimates of the effects of the pre-K program on subsequent
children’s health if there is no perfect manipulation of date of birth. The relevant histograms that
check whether there is any evidence of manipulation around the cutoffs used for RDD are in
Figure A2. There is clearly no evidence of manipulation around the cutoffs of December 31st,
2009 and December 31st, 2010.
The internal validity of the RDD requires that no relevant variables other than the treatment
jump at the cutoff. As suggested by Figure A1, and later shown in Section 4 there are systematic
differences in pre-existing health and utilization indicators before the UPK expansion. As a
result, a straightforward RDD may not estimate a plausible causal impact of the eligibility of the
pre-K program, let alone simple OLS estimations.
The DID approach allows for the existence of observed differences before the treatment, and
imposes a “common trend” assumption that such difference would remain the same if the
treatment had not been implemented, from a perspective of yearly average.
The estimation results from the OLS estimation (equation (1)), RDD approach (equation (2))
and DID approach (equation (3)) for the pooled sample are reported in Table B1. Despite the
concerns regarding reliability, the estimated effects from the standard RDD using local linear
estimation are largely consistent with Figure A1. The main results from DRD are substantially
different from the results from the OLS, RDD and DID estimations.

C Attrition from NYC Medicaid
One possible concern for our findings is that some eligible children become ineligible for
Medicaid during academic year 2014-2015. The free pre-K program allows the household to
reallocate resources, e.g., by increasing maternal labor supply.18 The following increased
household income may lead the children becomes ineligible for Medicaid, thus leaving our
sample. In this scenario, the estimation in this paper may underestimate (or overestimate) the
benefit (harm) from the pre-K program.
We examine the potential impact of pre-K eligibility on two indicators of Medicaid attrition.
One is whether the children went off and then back on Medicaid (cycling), and the other is the
number of months on Medicaid. The results are shown in Table C1. During the pre-K year, the
eligible children are more likely to leave Medicaid and come back later, but they do not stay on
Medicaid for shorter time. The effect of being eligible for the pre-K program on number of
months on Medicaid is almost zero. For the kindergarten year, we do not find any significant
effect on Medicaid attrition. Overall there is not much evidence of higher attrition rate in the
treatment group.

The existing literature on the effect of preschool program on maternal labor supply provides us a mixed picture.
While Berlinski, Galiani, and McEwan (2011) find positive effect of preschool attendance of the youngest children
on maternal labor supply in Argentina, Fitzpatrick (2010) finds little effect of the pre-K program in the US. In this
paper, we may expect a positive effect of the pre-K program on maternal labor supply because the mothers in our
sample are from low-income backgrounds.

E Survival Analysis of the First Treatment of Hearing and Vision Problems
The Cox model adopted in the main analysis is semi-parametric without specifying the
baseline hazard (which is the hazard for the ineligible children before the expansion). It is
sensitive to omitted covariates, and assumes that the UPK works by multiplying the baseline
hazard by a constant. Alternatively, we model the hazard of first treatment by a parametric
accelerated failure-time (AFT) model, which allows for omitted covariates and an effect to
accelerate or decelerate the survival time of no treatment by some constant. Specifically, we have
the following AFT model:

is the effect

of UPK on the survival time (until the first treatment). We examine two types of AFT models:
Weibull and loglogistic. Both satisfy the general features of an AFT model discussed above. The
Weibull AFT model assumes that
AFT assumes that

follows an extreme-value distribution and the loglogistic

follows a logistic distribution. The latter also allows for a non-monotonic

hazard function with respect to time.
Table E1 summarizes the estimated effects on the hazard of the first treatment (the Cox
model) and the estimated effects on survival time until the first treatment (AFT models). The
results are robust to various model settings and consistent with Figure 3.

Note: The specification estimated in the table is equation (6) for the Cox model and equation (E1) for the Weibull
AFT model and the loglogistic AFT model, with the children in the 120-day window. Because of the data limitation,
hazard and survival time are measured starting from age 2. The sample sizes are 85,044 for hearing problems and
80,074 for vision problems. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses. ** and *** indicates statistical
significance at 5% and 1% level, respectively.
