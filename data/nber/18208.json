    "abstract": "\n\nWe use novel data from a leading online job search platform to examine the impact of corporate distress on firms\u2019 ability to attract job applicants. Survey responses suggest that job seekers accurately perceive firms\u2019 financial condition, as measured by companies\u2019 credit default swap prices and accounting data. Analyzing responses to job postings by major financial firms during the Great Recession, we find that an increase in an employer\u2019s distress results in fewer and lower quality applicants. These effects are particularly evident when the social safety net provides workers with weak protection against unemployment and for positions requiring a college education.\n\n",
