First, in its present state, trade theory provides little guidance as to the role of trade policy and trade strategy in promoting growth. Second, the empirical evidence overwhelmingly indicates that there are important links between them. Third, a number of hypotheses as to the reasons for these links have been put forward, but there is not as yet sufficient evidence to enable us to estimate their relative importance.\n\n",
