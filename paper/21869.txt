ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the cost of a policy to restrict water trades to mining firms in northern Chile
to protect riparian ecosystems and indigenous agriculture. In response to the policy, mining firms
have developed high-cost desalination and pumping facilities to secure adequate water supplies.
We develop a methodology and estimate the cost of market transactions that fail to occur due to
the policy. Lost trade surplus is estimated at $52 million per year. Without trade restrictions,
around 86% of the remaining agricultural water in the region would be transferred to mining.

I. INTRODUCTION
In developed countries, high demand for environmental protection can lead to high-cost
policies, especially when coupled with distortionary policies that occur through trade restrictions,
rather than more efficient instruments due to their political exigency (Anderson 1995). In the
context of the United States, economists have estimated the costs of several policies including
the Clean Air Act (Greenstone et al 2012); the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Kotchen and
Burger 2007); the protection of the Spotted Owl (Montgomery et al 1994); and EPA pesticide
regulation (Cropper et al 1992). Arrow et al. (1996) suggest that benefit-cost analysis has a
crucial role to play in the creation and evaluation of environmental regulations, and therefore
these cost estimates contribute to our understanding of regulation generally. This same logic can
apply to the context of a developing country. Regulation in developing countries can reduce
growth or provide significant net benefits to consumers, depending on the relative costs and
benefits (Guasch and Hahn 1999)
In this paper we estimate an environmental policy cost in the context of a developing
economy—water trading restrictions in northern Chile. We focus our estimate in a partialequilibrium setting on the “direct compliance cost,” as categorized by Pizer and Kopp (2005). In
doing so, we are conscious of Davies’ (1997) note of caution in evaluating regulatory costs in
developing countries: “Many regulatory problems entail an asymmetry, with the impact on a
large and diffuse group being evaluated against that on a small, more cohesive one… Economic
measures of the value of time, of health and of life itself are likely to be low for the poor, and
efficiency assessments are therefore likely to place a low value on regulations designed to save
their time or lives or improve their health.” This concern is relevant, as the regulation in question
is intended in part to provide water for the developmental and cultural needs of indigenous
2

populations, and the regulatory burden falls primarily on a small group of mining firms. While
the valuation of policy benefits is beyond the scope of our work, we discuss the nature of the
policy benefits in detail in the discussion section.
Chile’s water code generally allows for unregulated trading of water rights (Hearne and
Easter 1995; Bauer 1998; Hearne and Donoso 2014). 2 However, Chile’s growing income has
increased demand for environmental amenities, which are not well defined in the private right
system (Hearne 1998) and the impacts of the initial water right assignments on indigenous
communities remain unresolved (Prieto 2016). In the hyper-arid Antofagasta Region of northern
Chile, which produces 17% of world copper supply (Cochilco, 2014), these issues have led to a
change in policy by the water regulator, the Dirección General de Aguas (DGA). The DGA has
denied mining firms in the region the ability to use purchased agricultural water rights in mining
operations in order to protect water access for small, indigenous farming communities and
regional wetland ecosystems. Mining firms have responded by shifting water input to the
desalination and pumping of seawater, which must be pumped as far as 150 km (93 miles) to
altitudes over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) above sea level. The cost of desalinated water is
substantially higher than the observed market price of water in local agriculture, and the
generation of energy for both desalination and pumping releases greenhouse gases. 3
We use a dataset of water right transfers, available in Chile due to a unique reporting
requirement equivalent to that required for real estate sales, to estimate the policy cost. Ideally,
we would like to compare the willingness to pay of agricultural water users with mining users
using actual market transactions. Unfortunately, the policy change induced mining firms to shift

An anonymous reviewer points out that DGA retains the power to restrict changes in water use or location after
trades throughout Chile (Bauer 1998; Hearne and Easter 1995).

of renewables, especially solar, which currently make up around 3.6% of generated supply (CDEC-SING, 2015).

to desalinated water. To estimate mining willingness-to-pay, we develop cost estimates for the
desalinated water projects undertaken after the implementation of the trade restrictions. We do
observe the market price in the regulated market, which we use to estimate agricultural
willingness to pay. We then simulate the transfer to mining firms of water currently in use in
agriculture. Doing so allows us to estimate that the direct cost of this policy is $52 million per
year. 4 These costs are primarily borne by mining firms, whose gross revenues from the region in
2015 were around $11.8 billion.5
While a great deal of attention has been paid to the costs of environmental policy, this
work typically examines regulation that affects production directly. There has been less analysis
of the cost of environmental regulation of input markets where final product costs are more
difficult for consumers to detect. This paper contributes to the literature by: (i) providing a
methodology for estimating the cost of potential market transactions that are lost due to
regulation; (ii) estimating the cost of environmental regulation in the context of a developing
country; and (iii) estimating the costs associated with water transfer regulation. Estimating the
benefits of the policy is beyond the scope of the current work, but cost estimates do provide a
baseline, indicating what value benefits must exceed to have a benefit-to-cost ratio greater than
one. In Section II we explain the Chilean setting and how water is traded and regulated. Section
III explores the regulatory effect on market prices. Section IV develops a methodology and
estimates the deadweight cost of the policy. Finally, section V is a discussion of the results,
including a discussion of the benefits of the policy.

II. BACKGROUND
Water allocation in the Antofagasta region of Chile has become a contentious policy
issue due to the coincidence of low precipitation, less than 5mm per year, and high demand. The
mining sector, accounting for around 50% of $21.5 billion in regional GDP in 2016, requires
significant water input for ore production and processing. The local agricultural sector retains
rights to a significant portion of the region’s water while producing less than $6 million in output
annually. 6 Although the agricultural sector holds 18% of water rights, it accounts for 33% of
freshwater consumption. The mining industry holds 76% of water rights but consumes 56% of
freshwater. The discrepancy is due to the restrictions imposed on the use of water rights by
mining firms. Because many water rights owned by mining firms are not used, the proportion of
actual water use in agriculture is higher. Table 1 shows the estimates of water consumption and
rights held by sector.
Mining freshwater is obtained from surface dams and groundwater pumping in the
Andean highlands above the seeps and diversion points that feed wetlands and provide water to
indigenous villages. As a result, mining water extraction has reduced water tables and surface
flows, leading to declines in arable land and wetlands:
“Environmentally, Andean wetlands are also essential components of the regional
hydrological cycle, and concentrate biodiversity and environmental services in the
border or in the middle of the desert. They have offered permanent native grasses
and allowed the development of agricultural crops. These crops have sustained
ancestral village settlements made up of indigenous communities, for whom land
and water are indivisible goods, with high economic, social, cultural, and spiritual
values. Historically, mining has exploited surface water bodies, whose depletion
and overexploitation have reduced availability and dramatically affected
ecosystems and local communities (Romero et al, 2012).”

Regional wetlands encompass an area of 6,904 hectares, around 0.05% of total land area,
and provide important habitat for many species, as well as being linked to traditional agricultural
lifestyles (Centro de Ecología Aplicada, 2011, p. 54). Approximately 2,000 hectares of irrigated
land, out of a total of 12.6 million hectares in the Antofagasta Region, allow indigenous
communities to engage in traditional agriculture. Mining diversions reduce the water available
for ecological production and agriculture. Figure 1 shows a map of the region and includes the
locations of major mines. The figure also shows the main local water source for the region, the
Loa River, which forms a “U” near the border with the Tarapacá region. The small triangles
represent the approximate locations of indigenous agriculture and nearby principle wetland sites,
although only a portion of the mapped areas are active wetlands. 7 Mines extract water above
these areas and pipe the water to the mines.
The indigenous population is primarily not located in the small, rural communities, but in
the urban areas, and preferences across this population for environmental and indigenous policies
are heterogeneous. Data from the Chile National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey (2015)
show there are 20,820 employed indigenous persons in the region, with 706 (3.4%) working in
agriculture and 4,853 (23.3%) working in the mining sector. Both sectors make up a larger
portion of the indigenous workforce than in the non-indigenous workforce, 0.53% and 18.6%
respectively, and the large difference in agriculture suggests more sensitivity to the indigenous
workforce to changes in agricultural employment. To date, there has been little discussion of the
effect of DGA policies on mining sector employment, perhaps because regulatory costs affect
profitability but not demand for employment or the causal link is less clear.

The locations of these communities are approximate based on water right descriptions and aerial photos of
irrigation.

The allocation of water is determined by the country’s 1981 water code, which
established tradable water rights that were separable from the land. The original water code
included few environmental controls (Bauer, 1997; Mentor, 2001); and rights to environmental
amenities associated with in situ water use were not defined statutorily (Grafton et al., 2011). 8 In
the Antofagasta Region, the period after the adoption of the water code in 1981 was
characterized by rapid development of water resources by mining firms with little regard to
larger externalities. Water infrastructure projects focused on providing water for mining rather
than local or wetland uses (Peña, 2011). Downstream from mining and agricultural diversions,
streamflow in the Loa River, the main water source in the region, decreased by two-thirds from
1961 to 1990. 9
Buyers and sellers in the water market fall broadly into three categories: agricultural,
mining, and government. Agricultural buyers and sellers are individual irrigators transacting in
the market for water rights to irrigate small fields. Mining buyers and sellers are firms engaged
in mining or industrial activities and their direct use of the water is typically in ore extraction and
processing and related services. Governmental buyers and sellers are communities as well as the
national government. 10 Indigenous communities buy water rights through the national Fund for
Indigenous Lands and Waters to preserve their community’s access to water, and are therefore

In 2015, the water code was modified (Law 20017). The main changes included the requirement of a fee for
a water right that is not being in used and granting to the DGA the authority to establish an ecological flow at
the time that new water rights are granted.

classified as governmental buyers even though the water’s ultimate purpose is typically
agriculture (World Bank, 2011).
After Chile’s return to democracy in 1990, a rapid expansion of mining occurred in the
region, driven by investment by large multinational mining firms, both Chilean and foreignowned. Figure 2 shows copper revenue in the region split into income from the nationalized firm,
Codelco, and others. 11 Private firms began to acquire additional water rights in the market to
increase production, especially as copper prices rose in the mid-2000s. After a water right sale is
complete, a mining firm applies to the DGA to transfer the right to a new use and extraction
point under the water code and environmental law (Chilean Law 19.300). In the mid-2000s these
reviews led to the rejection of several change-of-use or change-of-extraction-point applications.
While mining firms still held the water right, they were forbidden from using the water for
mining. For example, the mining company Minera Quadra bought underground water rights in
2008 in the Pampa Llalqui, 30 kilometers from Calama, for around US$40 million, but has not
received permission to use the rights for mining.
The rejection of change requests by the DGA had a significant effect on the market for
water rights. As trade restrictions limited mining purchases from agriculture, firms turned to
desalination and the transport of water from sea level to remote mines (Cristi et al. 2014). Mines
vary in their distance from the coast and elevation above sea level. The highest cost desalinated
water is that delivered to the Escondida mine, 150 km (93 miles) inland at an altitude of around
3,200 meters (9,800 feet) above sea level. Because the cost of desalinated water is substantially

higher than the observed market price of water in local agriculture, this policy is potentially
costly.
The remainder of the paper estimates the cost of the policy. First, we perform an
econometric analysis on recorded water right transactions, from which we arrive at a point
estimate for the price of an agricultural water right. Second, we parameterize a simulation model
of the deadweight cost of the policy using the water right transfer data as well as data on
desalination costs.

III. TRADING RESTRICTIONS
Water Transfer Data
A dataset of surface water transfers was constructed by the authors from records in the
Loa River basin of the Antofagasta Region from 1995 to 2014, the full time period for which
data are available. Transaction records are compiled by the Superintendencia de Servicios
Sanitarios for use in setting water rates to urban customers. Records were obtained for the
“Official Database” used for rate setting, which eliminates trades beyond the Loa basin, those
with missing water price data, exchanges involving land and buildings where water is bundled in
the transaction, groundwater transfers, and trades among family members. The final dataset
consists of 534 surface water transfers for which information is available on the date, buyer,
seller, quantity transacted, and the price at which the transfer occurred. Buyer and seller types
were classified into one of three categories—mining, agriculture, or government—described
above. When the transacting party was an individual’s name or a series of names, the party was
classified as agricultural. Mining classification occurred when the name of the transacting party
contained Ltda., Ltd, or S.A., indicating a business, or the name directly referenced a known
9

mine, mining firm, or a company associated with mining. Government classification occurred
when the transacting party’s name references a community, or local or national agency. 12
To simplify the analysis, we look at trades in three categories encompassing 91% of
recorded water transactions: agriculture-to-mining, agriculture-to-agriculture, and agriculture-togovernment. As the high-value users, mining firms have been active buyers of water rights but
not sellers. Similarly, government entities have been buyers. By limiting the sellers to agriculture
we are able to examine the effect of buyer type on sales from a single sector. Overall summary
statistics on prices, volume, and number of transfers are provided in column 4 of Table 2. Prices
are for a permanent transfer and are given in flow units. Throughout the paper water prices are
expressed as a right to a cubic meter of water, every day, in perpetuity: dollars per m3/day. 13
We use the available data on DGA reviews of surface water right transfers in the Calama
region to understand how these reviews may have affected the market. 14 In figure 3, the shaded
grey area shows the cumulative number of requests for water transfers reviewed by the DGA, by
the date submitted. The rejection rate is a five-year average of the percentage of reviews that
were rejected or withdrawn, by the date a decision was made. Only one application for a change
in surface water was approved after 2003. From February 2003 to July 2004, five surface
transfers representing 46% by volume of water transfer requests submitted up to that date were
denied.

12
The dataset does not contain any transactions by urban utilities directly. Both large cities in the region,
Antofagasta and Calama, hold reserved water rights. However, trades have occurred, for instance Antofagasta’s
water is managed by a subsidiary of Antofagasta Mineral, which desalinated 550 L/s of seawater so that the city’s
freshwater could be used by its mining arm.
13
A m3 is around 265 gallons, slightly more than the 208 gal./day the average Chilean family of four uses but less
than the 400 gal./day used by the average American family. Therefore a right to a m3/day is enough to supply a
Chilean family in perpetuity.
14
Data is from the Catastro Público de Aguas of the DGA.

10

Because of the change in the rate of regulatory denial in 2003, Table 2 displays summary
statistics through-2003 and post-2003 as well as for the entire period. Throughout the sample
period, mining firms appear to pay more for water on average than do agricultural and
government buyers. This may be indicative of mining firms selecting rights to purchase that
differ based on properties unobservable in the dataset. 15 The summary statistics are consistent
with a post-2003 change that constrained the supply of agricultural water rights available for
purchase by mining firms. The average volume transferred for all purchasers decreases from the
pre- to post-2003 period. Further, despite there being two more years in the post-2003 period, the
overall number of transfers to mining drops from 60 to 52. Prices and means for the summary
statistics table are calculated using the price per m3/day. However, the distribution of the log of
prices has a more symmetric distribution, as seen in the appendix figure A1. For this reason the
transformed prices are preferred for statistical analysis.
Econometric Approach
We estimate a regression equation to find the price paid when both buyer and seller are
agricultural users, as well as to examine the effect on water right prices of the 2003 increase in
regulatory rejections on different classes of transacting parties. We define an indicator variable
such that IR=1 when time t>2003 and IR=0 otherwise. The price of a water right, j, per unit (a
perpetual right to one cubic meter per day) is Pj. We regress the log of Pj on indicators of buyer
type, Iq, where q={M,G}, so that I𝑀𝑀 = 1 for a mining buyer, and I𝐺𝐺 = 1 for a government buyer,
and both are 0 for an agricultural buyer. Generally, our empirical specification takes the form:

15

An anonymous referee notes, correctly, that other explanations such as lower transaction costs for trades between
neighboring farmers could also partially explain these price differences.

𝑞𝑞∈{𝑀𝑀,𝐺𝐺}

The expected log value of an agricultural water right post-2003 when the seller and buyer
are agricultural is α + γ. This log price is distributed 𝑁𝑁(α + γ, σ2 ). We observe the coefficient

estimates, α
� and γ�, and the robust standard error estimate of their linear combination, σ
�n . The λ

coefficients indicate the extent to which mining and governmental buyers, relative to agricultural
buyers, paid higher prices to agricultural sellers, prior to 2003, while the δ coefficients indicate

whether this difference changed for rights purchased after 2003. These coefficients provide some
indication of whether non-agricultural buyers paid higher prices for water rights. To better isolate
the δ coefficients, we use a year dummy to control for year-to-year variation in water right price
in one specification.

Econometric Results
We run the regression from equation 1 to estimate the agriculture-to-agriculture transfer
price, 𝑝𝑝̂ . The results are shown in the first two specifications on Table 3, where we estimate the

2004-2014 average price of agricultural water: (1) regresses the log of the water right price on an
indicator for post-2003; and (2) includes controls for differential prices for government and
mining purchases both before and after 2003. Both specifications arrive at similar estimates for
𝑝𝑝̂ = α
� + γ�, the mean price post-2003. Using the estimate from (2) we find that the joint estimate
of α
� + γ� is 6.346 and σ
�n is 0.110. Transforming our estimates to dollars, the mean price is

around $574. We construct a 99% confidence interval for 𝑝𝑝̂ of ($264, $1247). 16
16

The expected value of the transformed lognormal distribution, from Zhou and Gao (1997), is:
1 2

𝑝𝑝̂ = 𝑒𝑒 α�+γ�+2σ�n . We construct a confidence interval, from Olsson (2005), of the exponent of:

12

We now turn to analysis of the mining price premium through time. Figure 4 plots the
results of regressions showing the yearly premium paid by mining buyers relative to agricultural
buyers. The specification used for this figure and coefficient estimates are shown in Table A1.
There is a two-year hiatus of mining water right purchases after 2003 as well as zero recorded
purchases in 2010 and 2014. This result is consistent with our understanding that the number and
volume of mining rights purchases decrease after 2003. While the price of water rights purchased
by mining firms does appear to increase relative to agricultural buyers for a few years post-2003,
there is not price divergence post-2010.
Results from the figure are consistent with those from running equation 1, shown in
Table 3. Specification (3) looks at the mining and government price premiums for the entire
sample period, while (2) looks at premiums before and after 2003, and (4), which includes a year
dummy to control for variation in a given year across trade types, only looks at the post-2003
premium. For the entire period, mining firms pay more on average for water rights. It may be the
case that firms can select on quality or regulatory attributes of rights that are unobserved in our
data set, causing their purchases to occur at higher price levels. However, after controlling for
year fixed effects in (4), it is not apparent that post-2003 the price premiums change relative to
what they were during the pre-2003 period. When mining firms do purchase water post-2003,
they pay a price similar to the going market price for agriculture-to-agricultural water—
significantly less than the desalination costs they concurrently undertake. We conclude from this

alternative estimation approach using estimated desalination costs in the next section.

IV. DEADWEIGHT LOSS
Simulation Approach
Similar to Griffin (2006, 40), we examine a simplified setting via a two-sector model,
where the supply of water is S, and this water can be put to two purposes, mining or agriculture,
as illustrated in Figure 5 with price on the y-axis and the amount of water in mining, 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀 , on the

x-axis. 17 We define the initial inverse demand curve for water in mining as 𝐷𝐷0 (𝑃𝑃) = 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀 and for
water in agriculture as 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 (𝑃𝑃) = 𝑄𝑄𝐴𝐴 . Initially, mining demand is low and the market clears.

Because 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀 + 𝑄𝑄𝐴𝐴 = 𝑆𝑆, the condition for the market clearing is 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴−1 (𝑆𝑆 − 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀 ) = 𝐷𝐷0−1 (𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀 ) =

𝑃𝑃0 . 18

When demand for water in mining increases, represented by demand shifting to 𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀 (𝑃𝑃),

regulatory restrictions are put into place, enforced via a rationing rule. We assume the regulatory
rule assigns a subset of the water that has been freely transferred to mining firms, 𝑄𝑄�𝑀𝑀 . This

1
−1 (𝑄𝑄
�𝑀𝑀 ) and 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 =
leaves 𝑆𝑆 − 𝑄𝑄�𝑀𝑀 water in agriculture. Now, two prices emerge, 𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀
= 𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀

𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴−1 (𝑆𝑆 − 𝑄𝑄�𝑀𝑀 ). The price of rights that can be transferred to mining must be at least as valuable

1
as those that cannot be moved from agriculture, 𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀
≥ 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 . 19 Without the transfer restrictions, the

17

For simplicity this model does not examine the urban sector as buyer or sellers, which is consistent with empirical
observations: over the period 1995-2014 our data set shown no municipal purchases or sales.
18
In this simplified model, there is no explicit term for water dedicated to ecosystems and environmental uses.
However, in the setting at hand, agricultural water is extracted after providing ecosystem flows, and so the
agricultural water and ecosystem water is the same.

19
This model is an abstraction of the reality. Mining firms may purchase rights at a price below 𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀
knowing that
there is some probability of rejection.

14

market clearing price would satisfy 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴−1 (𝑆𝑆 − 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀 ) = 𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀
𝑀𝑀 = 𝑃𝑃 , with the resulting amount
1
of water in mining 𝐷𝐷0 (𝑃𝑃1 ) = 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀
.

The shaded area in Figure 5 represents the lost trade surplus as a result of the regulatory

restriction on water markets. To find this area, which represents the cost of the policy, C, we
integrate between the demand curves:

− 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴−1 (𝑆𝑆 − 𝑄𝑄)] 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

(2)

To simulate the gains from allowing additional trades from agriculture to mining requires
1
estimating 𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀 and 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 , then solving for 𝑄𝑄𝑀𝑀
, and finally solving Equation 2. To estimate 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 we

use 𝑝𝑝̂ , from the regressions on water rights prices between agricultural water users, to calibrate a

demand curve using previous estimates of agricultural price elasticity and an assumption of a

constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functional form (Lichtenberg and Zilberman, 1986). The
CES demand function has the form:
𝑄𝑄 = 𝐴𝐴0 𝑝𝑝𝜂𝜂

(3)

Where A0 is a constant, Q is quantity of agricultural water used, p is price of water, and η
elasticity of water demand. The agricultural water transaction price, 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 , is used as a point

estimate to calibrate the CES demand curve, where 𝑄𝑄0 is the estimated water use in agriculture:
𝐴𝐴0 =

𝑄𝑄0
= 𝑄𝑄0 (𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 )−𝜂𝜂
(𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 )𝜂𝜂

(4)

Therefore, the price paid by an agriculturalist for a consumptive water right, 𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 , is

defined as:

𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴1 = 𝑝𝑝̂

(5)

Rewriting the agricultural demand curve, equation 3, in terms of price and substituting in (4) as
well as (5), we arrive at:

To find the willingness of mining firms to pay for water, 𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀 , we construct estimates of

willingness-to-pay based on the distance from the coast and elevation of mining operations using
desalinated water. Mines are located at various distances and elevations, creating a downward
sloping curve. We assume that if the policy restricting transfers was relaxed, agricultural water
would initially offset the most expensive desalinated water via market transactions.
The literature that considers water as an input in agricultural production often
distinguishes between applied water per acre and the effective water per acre (Bogges et al.
1993). The latter depends on irrigation technology, land quality, and soil type. Farmers divert
and apply a given quantity of water on their field, and some smaller quantity is used
consumptively through evapotranspiration while the remaining water returns to the system, with
the reuse possible in some circumstances. Chile’s system of tradable water rights does not
distinguish between applied water and effective water; an owner can always sell the right to the
total amount of applied water (Cristi 2010). For this reason, our analysis supposes the transfer of
water from agriculture to mining offsets an equivalent volume of desalinated water. The
willingness to pay by mining firms for agricultural water rights, p, is:

Table 5 describes the parameters used to calculate the policy cost. The key parameters are
estimated agricultural-to-agricultural water right price, 𝑝𝑝̂ ; quantity of agricultural water available

for transfer, Q0; the agricultural elasticity of water demand, η; and the cost of energy, E. Each of
these parameter has a baseline value, as well as a high and low value used for sensitivity
analysis. To estimate the quantity of water currently in agriculture, we use a baseline of the total
recorded agricultural surface water rights on the Loa River and tributaries, 185,674 m3/day

(DGA, 2005; Salazar et al., 2003). For the sensitivity analysis a range was chosen based on a low
estimate of available water using gauged flow in the Loa River of 129,600 m3/day and the
estimate of water use in agriculture from Table 1 of 285,811 m3/day.
To calculate agricultural sale price, we use the mean and confidence interval constructed
from estimates from specification (2) as described above. The price elasticity of demand for
water use is estimated to be -0.79 based on calculations from the literature (Schoengold et al.,
2006). A range from -0.25 (from Nieswiadomy, 1988) to -0.9 is used. Finally, we use water cost
estimates calculated and presented in Table 4 as our estimate of 𝐷𝐷𝑀𝑀 . 20 The methodology for

constructing this curve is provided in the appendix. The demand curve constructed from this
table is shown in Figure A2, with demand at quantity equal to zero being the current status quo
with no transfers to mining.

20

Mines may require additional security in water availability, i.e. they will need water even when there is a drought,
and therefore might construct desalination and pumping facilities to provide this water. In our analysis we do not
include the costs of the infrastructure, only the variable costs of desalination and pumping, to ensure our estimate is
conservative.

17

Two additional parameters, agricultural water return rate, R0, and the downstream flow
reduction coefficient of mining extractions, β, which both range between 0 and 1, are also
included in the interest of completeness. While the baseline set of assumptions are consistent
with the Chilean interpretation of hydrologic conditions, these additional parameters explore two
possibilities. First, that sales from agriculture are modified to reflect return flow; agricultural
users purchase a water right that entitles them to an amount of water, but their effective water use
is less. For the robustness check it is assumed effective water is only 20% of their applied water.
Second, sales might be modified to reflect the water savings of mining firm extractions high in
the Andean Plateau: we use calculations from the Ojos de San Pedro sub-basin within the Loa
River watershed to estimate that downstream flows are decreased only about 45% of the total
amount of upstream mining extraction due to savings from reduced evaporation and seepage
losses (Edwards and Kirk-Lawlor, 2013). 21

water transferred such that marginal prices are equalized. We find under the baseline scenario

that this occurs when 160,500 m3/day of water is permanently transferred out of agriculture to
mining firms. Full results are shown in Table A2 for the baseline specifications and the results of
varying each of the parameters. Because water right prices are expressed in perpetuity, the cost
estimate is a total present-value cost, which is $874 million for the baseline parameters. Using a
6% discount rate, the estimate can be converted to the yearly policy cost of $52M.

Figure 6 shows the sensitivity analysis graphically: the solid vertical line is the baseline
estimate; the dashed vertical lines show the 99% confidence interval constructed around the
mean agriculture-to-agriculture exchange price while holding all of the parameters at their
baseline values. 22 The horizontal lines represent the high and low cost estimates of changes in
each parameter value, holding all other parameters at their baselines. The sensitivity analysis
shows the cost estimate is particularly sensitive to electricity price. The cost estimate is also
sensitive to R0 and β independently. However, these variables would likely both change
simultaneously under a policy that accounted for effective water. A joint sensitivity analysis with
𝑅𝑅0 = 0.2 and 𝛽𝛽 = 0.45 results in a policy cost estimate of $76.86M/year.

The policy cost estimate is not a measure of welfare change because it does not

incorporate the non-market costs and benefits of the policy. Without the trade restrictions, we
estimate around 86% of the remaining surface water in the highlands would be removed from
agriculture, desiccating natural water sources and negatively affecting riparian ecosystems and
forcing indigenous communities out of their ancestral homeland. The policy also produces nonmarket costs, shifting mining production from highland water to seawater powered by fossil
fuels, and creating additional greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss these issues in the next
section.

VI. DISCUSSION
The primary result of this paper is the estimate of an annual $52.46M policy cost
associated with the DGA water use regulations. This result may be large or small, depending on
what benefits, and to whom, these costs are compared. Many of the benefits of the policy are

22

Note the upper confidence bound corresponds to the low welfare estimate, because high agricultural prices
indicate lower benefits from water transfers.

19

nebulous, making a full accounting difficult. Comparing the policy cost to total agricultural
output in the region of only $6 million annually suggests the cost is large. Indigenous groups
represent around 5% of total regional population, although the estimates of those directly
engaged in agriculture is only around 706. This implies a policy cost of over $74,000/year for
each active indigenous agriculturalist in the region.
However, the direct value of agricultural production is likely to underestimate the
importance of water to indigenous communities. The direct agricultural and cultural benefits of
the policy include cultural values associated with indigenous water use, avoided relocation costs,
and agricultural production. In the Aymara and Atacama cultures, the native people of the
Antofagasta region, water is viewed as a community asset (Peña 2004). Further, the costs of
relocating entire villages that are desiccated would likely be much higher than lost agricultural
production. For example, the Ojos de San Pedro (OdSP) area of the highlands in the Antofagasta
Region was once the location of a lake and wetland system that supported a unique ecology and
a small village. Even early water extraction by mining firms through 1970, however, led to
severe impacts, including a complete desiccation of the area and the abandonment of the village
(Edwards and Kirk-Lawlor, 2013). While compensation was not paid in this case, it is difficult to
imagine in modern Chile that relocation would not entail significant economic and sociological
costs.
The environmental benefits of the policy include tourism and the intrinsic value Chileans
attribute to protecting their ecosystems. The policy serves to partially protect highly valued
tourist destinations, including the Los Flamencos National Reserve near the city of San Pedro de
Atacama. Further, many Chileans place intrinsic value on the preservation of their unique
ecosystems, and the policy cost per Chilean is less than $3 per year. When compared to gross
20

mining revenues from the region in 2015 of around $11.8 billion, and coupled with the
environmental and cultural benefits, the policy costs may appear small.
There are also additional policy costs that arise from the carbon emissions as a result of
desalinating and pumping water. Because freshwater delivery is gravity fed, it is possible to
make a back-of-the-envelope calculation on the total carbon emissions. Our baseline projection
is that 160,500 m3/day of freshwater could be provided, offsetting $52.46 million in electricity
costs or 1.10B kWh of electricity per year. The northern Chilean grid is 75.6% coal, 13.5%
natural gas, and 6.7% fuel oil and diesel (CDEC-SING, 2015). CO2 releases are 0.972 kg/kWh
for coal, 0.434 kg/kWh for natural gas, and 0.865 kg/kWh for fuel oil no. 6 (authors’ calculations
from 2010 data from EIA (2017)). This leads to an estimate of the policy causing an additional
721,451 metric tons of CO2 emissions. The social cost of carbon is estimated at $43.00 per
metric ton, the mean of the peer-reviewed studies surveyed by Tol (2005). This leads to a cost
estimate of $31.02 million per year.
The high policy costs relative to agricultural production and employment and the
potential environmental costs of increased carbon emissions, coupled with the high cultural and
intrinsic values placed on in situ water challenge policy makers and regulators to find alternative
solutions. Markets may offer a partial solution. The Chilean government purchases water rights
through the Fund for Indigenous Lands and Waters that are then granted to the communities in
perpetuity. In this way the rights are purchased at a market price from current right holders,
moving water to protect environmental and indigenous benefits without reducing the value of
property held by agricultural producers. These trades make marginal water values and the cost to
the government of the policy explicit, illustrating the tradeoffs between conservation and
development. However, once these assets are transferred to villages, sale requires agreement of
21

the entire community. Thus, these rights, although extremely scarce, have limited direct financial
value due to low agricultural productivity in the region.
Beyond making tradeoffs explicit, it is worth considering alternative transfer and
compensation mechanisms that might facilitate mutually beneficial exchange. Currently, the
guidelines issued by the Chilean Undersecretary on Mining for the best-practices for indigenous
relations suggest mining firms work to protect the natural heritage and water flows, utilizing
formal commitments with indigenous villages. It goes on to suggest that to meet this objective,
firms should preferentially use seawater. We suggest two potential alternatives. First, firms could
use this commitment process to determine to what extent village and mining water needs could
be met mutually, for instance if mining firms worked with communities on the location and
amount of water diversions. Second, indigenous villages could be compensated, for instance
investment in infrastructure and education, in addition to the payment firms make to water right
holders. While formal property rights offer advantages in the exchange of water by lowering
transaction costs, the problem of social cost emerges because the private costs facing decision
makers are less than social costs. Although the formal water right system may fail to account for
externalities, the argument made by Coase (1960) would suggest that stakeholders and mining
companies could potentially engage in beneficial bargaining provided they can define the
resource they are bargaining over.

Notes: The water cost estimates use a 6% discount rate. Two desalination projects to provide urban water to coastal
cities are also included because the urban utility (Aquas Antofagasta) has switched urban users to desalinated water
freeing surface water for mining use, without incurring pumping costs. Some of the projects listed (Algorta Norte,
Sierra Gorda, and Michilla II) have utilized direct seawater, but we have chosen to estimate the desalinated water
cost because the direct seawater has proven problematic due to its corrosive properties. Source: authors’

Energy-Cost Calculations
To calculate energy costs in Table 4, we followed the following steps:
1.

In a perfect world with no energy losses in pumps and motors, and no other energy
losses due to friction, pipe bends, valves, and fittings, you would use 9.81 Joules of
energy to lift one litre of water up a height of one meter. 23

This means that to lift 1 m3 of water up a height of one meter, you would need 9.81
kiloJoules (kJ) of energy.

3.

1 kiloWatt-hour (kWh) of electricity contains 3,600 kiloJoules (kJ) of energy. 24

4.

Statements 1 and 3 imply that to lift a m3 of water up a height of one meter, you would
need 9.81/3,600 = 0.002725 kwh. This is so in a perfect, no-loss, world.

5.

This means that to lift one m3/day up a height of “x” meters, the annual energy
requirement would be:
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =

=

= 0.000994625 𝑥𝑥

(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀/(m3/day))

6.

The above refers only to lifting energy requirements. Additionally, we have considered
a “distance cost”. We have assumed that the energy required to lift 1 m3 of water up a
height of 1.2 meters is equivalent to the energy required to pump the same m3 of water
to a distance of 1 kilometer.

7.

Statements 5 and 6 imply that the annual energy requirement to pump a m3/day of water
up to a height of “x” meters, at a distance of “y” kilometers, is equal to:
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑙𝑙 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =

day))

(𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀/(m3/day))

Assuming an efficiency factor of 50%, the annual energy requirement can be written
as:
𝐴𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = 0,00198925x + 0,0023871 y (𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀/(m3/

9.

To this number, we add the desalination-plant annual energy cost, assumed to be equal
to 2.4 MWH per m3/day.

10.

We assumed an energy cost of 47.6 dollars per MWH, equal to the average clearing
price in 2016 auction to supply regulated-clients energy needs for 20 years starting
2021.

11.

We assumed a discount rate, to get a perpetuity value of water rights, of 6%, equal to
the social rate of discount used by the Chilean Ministry of Social Development to
evaluate public projects.

12.

The above numbers imply an energy cost, in dollars, per m3/day of water rights
(perpetual) equal to:

13.

1,904 + 1.5781 x + 1.8938 y

Table 4 uses the above formula in all cases, even though some projects involve seawater
pumping. This is the case of Algorta Norte, Sierra Gorda, Esperanza and Michilla
(partially). Today, common practice pumps desalinated water only.

Desalination Plant Data
Data in table 4 was initially collected from GWI (2012). Data was confirmed/updated using the
following sources:
•

•
•
•

Escondida/ El Coloso II was renamed “Escondida mega plant” and was operational in
2017: 216,000 m3/day capacity source: https://www.desalination.biz/news/0/Escondidamega-plant-poised-to-produce-water-in-March/8648/;
http://www.bechtel.com/projects/escondida-water-supply/
Algorta Norte is an iodine producer and uses direct seawater; project was updated to
operational (http://algortanorte.com/en/community/medio-ambiente/)
Sierra Gorda utilizes seawater and was updated to operational
(http://kghm.com/en/completion-seawater-pipeline-sierra-gorda-mine)
Desaladora Sur is on hold but still intended to be built so was removed
(http://www3.aguasantofagasta.cl/desalacion.html)
