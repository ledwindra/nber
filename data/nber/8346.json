    "abstract": "\n\nStandards and technical regulations which govern the admissibility of imported goods into an economy raise costs of exporters entering new markets, and may have a particularly high impact on firms seeking to export from developing countries.  Yet standards may also have a positive side, such as certifying product quality and safety for the consumer.  This paper suggests approaches to modeling standards and technical regulations, with a particular concern that these approaches are at least potentially implementable in an applied general-equilibrium model with real data.\n\n",
