    "abstract": "\n\nIn economies with a large informal sector firms can increase profits by reducing workers\u2019 outside options in that informal sector. We formalize this idea in a simple model of an agricultural economy with plantation owners who lobby the government to enact coercive policies\u2014e.g. the eviction and incarceration of squatting small-hold farmers\u2014that reduce the value to working outside the formal sector. Using unique data for 14 British West Indies \u2018sugar islands\u2019 from the year of slave emancipation in 1838 until 1913, we examine the impact of plantation owners\u2019 power on wages and coercion-related incarceration. To gain identification, we utilize exogenous variation in the ease with which smallholders could evade the plantation system in the different islands over time. Where evading the plantation system became exogenously easier, planter power declined, incarceration rates dropped, and agricultural wages rose, accompanied by a decline in formal agricultural employment. Most of the wage increase can be statistically explained by the reduced coercion of smallholders.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nWe are especially indebted to Jim Robinson who, in the initial stages of the project when we were wallowing in case studies drawn from disparate times and places, encouraged us to focus on the British Empire and the under-exploited Colonial Blue Book data. We are also indebted to Elhanan Helpman for his encouragement in exploring the relationship between international trade and domestic institutions. We benefited from discussions with Daron Acemoglu, Lee Alston, Quamrul Ashraf, Magda Bisieda, Kyle Bagwell, Abhijit Banerjee, Stanley Engerman, James Fenske, Murat Iyigun, Sara Lowes, Karthik Muralidharan, Suresh Naidu, Luigi Pascali, Diego Puga, Manisha Shah, Shanker Satyanath, Alan Taylor, Duncan Thomas, Vitaly Titov, Francesco Trebbi and seminar participants at Boulder, CIFAR, ERWIT, Harvard (PIEP) , LSE, Los Andes Namur, the NBER Development Economics Conference, PSE, Ryerson, Stanford, Toronto (Law Faculty), Toulouse, Western, the World Bank, UBC, UC Davis, and UC San Diego.
