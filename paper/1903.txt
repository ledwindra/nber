April 1986

A "Gold Standard isn't Viable Unless
Supported by Sufficiently Flexible Monetary and Fiscal Policy

ABSTRACT

The paper studies an idealized gold standard in a two—country
setting. Without flexible national domestic credit expansion (dce)
policies which offset the effect of money demand shocks on international
gold reserves, the gold standard collapses with certainty in finite time
through a speculative selling attack against one of the currencies.
Various policies for postponing a collapse are considered.
When a responsive dce policy eliminates the danger of a run on a
country's reserves, the exogenous shocks disturbing the system which
previously were reflected in reserve flows, now show up in the behaviour
of the public debt. Unless the primary (non—interest) government
deficit is permitted to respond to these shocks, the public debt is
likely to rise (or fall> to unsustainable levels.
For the idealized gold standard analysed in the paper, viability
can be achieved only through the active and flexible use of monetary and
fiscal policy.

Introduction

This paper is a theoretical study of the viability of a fixed
exchange rate regime which for brevity I refer to as a gold standard.

In a two—country world the monetary authority of each country guarantees
the convertibility of its non—interest bearing fiat currency into gold

at a fixed price. There is an exogenously given global stock of gold,
which has no non—monetary uses.

I therefore abstract from one feature

of the historical gold standard, under which the international reserve
asset had uses as a private consumption good and as an industrial

intermediate good and raw material, and could itself be produced through

an extractive production process. The essence of 'gold' in this model
is that it is an "outside" non—interest bearing fiduciary asset whose

aggregate quantity is exogenous to each private and public agent in the
global economic system and1 to the system as a whole.
By viability of the gold standard I mean its probability of

survival and the expected duration of its survival. Special attention
is paid to the way in which particular monetary, financial and fiscal
policy actions, or rules, affect the viability of the system.
The paper extends to a two—country setti;ig the single country

analyses of a collapsing managed exchange rate regime by Kruqman £1979),
Flood and Garber [1983, 198'+a, b], Obstfeld E1984a, b, c) and others.

For a more descriptively realistic analysis of certain aspects of the
historical Gold Standard see e.g. Barro [1979), Eichengreen [1984,
1985a,b), Barsky and Summers [1985), Bordo and Schwartz £1984).

2

These papers in turn were macroeconomic applications of the seminal

paper by Salant and Henderson E19781 on collapsing commodity stockpiling

schemes. My approach owes a lot to the work of Grilli (1986] who
analysed buying and selling attacks on the same currency in a small
country model.

I use his idea of specifying two shadow floating

exchange rates, one governing a buying attack and one governing a
selling attack, although for the formal analysis in this paper I reduce
these two to a single shadow floating exchange rate between two

absorbing barriers. Flood and Garber (1983) use a log—linear continuous
time stochastic two—country model to analyse a different class of

problems (stochastic process switches) which could be formalized in
terms of the beha';iour of a stochastic process and a single absorbing
barrier.

Section 2 outlines the model. Section 3 develops the
characterization of the "shadow floating exchange rate' as a Wiener

process, with or without drift, between two absorbing barriers. s long
as the shadow floating exchange rate stays between the barriers (in the

viable or safe range) the gold standard survives. When the shadow rate
reaches either barrier, the gold standard collapses through a
speculative selliig attack on one of the two currencies.

Section 4 looks at the various ways in which policy actions can
affect the shadow floating exchange rate process and thus the viability

of the gold standard. It considers in detail those policy actions that,
(leaving unchanged the nature of the shadow floating exchange rate
process as a Wiener process with drift -between two absorbing barriers

3

and leaving unchanged the variance of that process), alter the width of
the viable range, the drift paramer (the instantaneous mean of the

process) and the initial value of the shadow rate. Section

considers

feedback policies that turn the (non—stationary) Wiener process into a

stationary stochastic process. Section 6 looks at policies that can
alter directly the variance parameter of the original Wiener process.

2. The Model

10) R > RMIN +

Because the model include.s accounting identities as well as relative
price levels, there is no convenient log—linear specification.

4

The two countries are assumed to have identical demand for money

functions (equations (1) and (2)). This permits us to analyse exchange
rate behaviour without having to specify a goods market equilibrium

condition. Starred variables refer to foreign country variables.

i is

the nominal interest rate, y real output, M the nominal money stock, P
the price level, B the stock of government bonds, R the stock of foreign
exchange reserves, LI the primary (i.e. non—interest) government deficit

and S the spot exchange rate (the domestic currency price of foreign

currency). We assume i, i > 0. Interest is not paid on reserves, a
realistic assumption under a gold standard, when the domestic and
foreign currency prices of gold are fixed.

There is a single traded good. (3) is the law of one price.

Financial markets ar efficient and there are risk—neutral speculators,
so uncovered interest parity (UIP) holds, as given in (4).Et is the
expectation operator conditional on information available at time t.
The total stock of gold in the world economy is exogenously given.
Consumption and production of gold are therefore ignored.
Each country maintains convertibility of its currency into gold as
long as its stock of reserves exceeds an exogenously given critical

minimum value (RMIN for the home country, RJN for the foreign
country). If either country's stock of reserves falls to its lower
threshold, the fixed exchange rate regime collapses and a free float of

indefinite duration begins. Equation (10) states that there are enough

5

global reserves to satisfy the two countries' minimal reqt.firements

simultaneously.3

Linearizing the model and evaluating it at the fixed exchange rate
S which, without loss of generality, can be set equal to unity, we
obtain the following first order differential equation for the floating
exchange rate:4

Most of the analysis is concerned only with differences between the
values of country—specific variablessuch as domestic credit expansion,
money demand groth etc. It may be helpful to think of country—specific
or global variabes (real output, the world price level under a fixed
exchange rate) as not having any long—run trend. This makes the
standard convention in this literature of specifying reserve floors or
ceilings in nominal terms (rather than in real terms or relative to some
nominal scale variable such as nominal income, trade or financial
wealth) less objectionable. The analytically most convenient way of
specifying the world commodity market equilibrium condition required to
solve for individual countries' price levels and nominal interest rates,
is to postulate a fixed ex—ante real interest rate.

From the assumption of minimal global reserve adequacy (eqn(lO)) it
follows that K > 0 and therefore that

9

(18c) 5(t) > 5(t)

We therefore rewrite condition (17) for viability of the fixed
exchange rate system as:

9(S (S+K
Without loss of generality we can choose the lower bound to equal

zero.5 Formally, the exercise we are performing can therefore be seen
as the analysis of a continuous time stochastic process S between two
absorbing barriers; the lower barrier 0 and the upper barrier K > 0.

(19) 0<S<K

This is illustrated in Figure 1. S(t) represents a realization which
is absorbed at the upper barrier at t0. S1(t) is absorbed at the lower
barrier at t1.

Except in Section 5 we assume that dD, dD* and dZ are each governed
by mutually serially independent Brownian motion with drift t, i.e.

We can always replace expressions such as prob(S < S < S + K) with
the equivalent prob(0 < S — S < K), if we also change the initial

condition of the stochastic process involved in an appropriate manner.

3. The Gold Standard as a Wiener Process With Two Absorbing Barriers.
From the characterization of S as a Wiener process between two
absorbing barriers, a number of propositions follow immediately.

Proposition 1. Under the conditions specified in Section 2, the
gold standard collapses in finite time (with probability 1).

Proof. A Wiener process, with or without drift (i.e. with
0), between two absorbing barriers is absorbed with probability 1

in finite time. See e.g. 3. M. Harrison [1985, p. 43].

Note that the variante of the shadow floating exchange rate

increases without bound as t increases. Any gold standard with a finite
global stock of gold reserves will be non—viable, in the sense that a
speculative attack will exhaust one country's reserves with probability
one in finite time.

It is important to note that, at a point in time, the 'fundamental'
shocks to domestic credit and money demand are infinitesimal, i.e. of

measure zero compared to the stock of reserves at that instart. It
always takes a finite amount of time to achieve a finite change in the

stock of reserves through the cumulative effect of these shocks. The
finite, stock—shift rundown in a country's stock of reserves at the
moment a speculative attack occurs, reflects the .endogenous behaviour of

speculators, not the occurrence of an exogenous shock that is large
relative to thc existing stock of reserves.

1k

An implication of this specification of the exogenous shocks is
that neither currency will ever be at a forward discount or premium, as

long as the gold standard survives. At the instant a speculative attack
brings down the gold standard, a forward discount or premium consistent
with UIP may of course emerge.

Let r be the time at which the gold standard collapses, either
•

because S reaches K > 0 or because it reaches 0. Let 5(0)

be the initial value of Sat t = 0 and let

and

S0 €[Q, K)

be the drift and

variance parameter of S. p(S0, s; U is the conditional probability
that S is at S at time t > 0 given.that it starts at S0 at time t =
when there are two absorbing barriers, at K > 0 and at 0, and with

0 < S0 < K. Then (see Cox and Miller t1965, p. 219—234])

4. Monetary, Financial and Fiscal Policy ctLons and the Viability
of the Gold Standard.

No attention is paid in this paper to strateg2c behaviour by the

monetary and fiscal authorities of the two countries. It is probably
easiest to think of the various policy actions as being implemented by

18

mutual agreement or co—operatively; formally, we simply vary policy
parameters in an exogenously given manner without worrying about
conjectured and actual responses of other policy makers, time

consistency of the actions or rules etc. Consideration of those very
important issues is beyond the scope of this paper.
We distinguish 5 different kinds of policy actions.

a> Policies that change the initial value or starting value of the
shadow floating exchange rate process at t =

0, S.

b) Policies that change the drift of the shadow floating exchange rate

process, p.
C) Policies that change the width of the "safe or viable band", K.
d) Policies that change the S process from a Wiener process with drift
and variance parameter

2

to a stationary first order linear

stochastic process whose "forcing variable" is a Wiener process without
drift, i.e. to

(31) dS =

Sdt

1-

dw

dw NIID (0, adt)

e) Policies that change the variance parameter of the S process,

It will become clear that any given policy action or rule change

may bring about several of these five consequences atthe same time.
A number of results are immediately established.

Clearly, policies that widen the viable band by raising the upper
limit reduce the probability of the collapse of the gold standard
occurring through a selling attack on the home currency.
Note from the definition of K in (1Gb) that an increase in Krneans
an increase in the global stock of reserves and/or a reduction in the
countries' critical reserve thresholds. Since the e>periment holds S0
constant (and

the increase in A or reduction in RMIN or RIN must

20

be accompanied by a reduction in D(O) or an increase in D*(0) (see 24c>.
Such a combination of events obviously makes it more likely that the
collapse, when it occurs, will occur through a run on the foreign

currency. The increase in world reserves is allocated to the home
country.

We can summarize the main findings of the. discussion of increases
in K as follows.

Proposition 2. A larger global stock of gold reserves raises the
length of the expected survival period of the gold standard. Collapse
in finite time remains a certainty, however, with any finite stock of
reserves.

Policies That Change S
I now consider policies that change S0 without causing changes in
K,

or c. It is easily seen from (24c), (18b) and (24a) and (24b)

that such policies are redictributions of the given global stock of

gold. An increase in D(0) — D*(0) redistributes reserves from the home
country to the foreign country and raises

Such stock—shift changes

The problem with such redistributions of world reserves is that
even when they raise E0(r) (something both countries can agree on), the
probability of the collapse of the gold standard, when it occurs,
occurring through a speculative selling attack on currency X always
increases (decreases) when country X gives up (acquires) reserves
through the open market sales and purchases outlined above.

If there is

any opprobrium attached to succombing to a speculative selling attack,
countries that have excessive reserves (from the point of view of the

survival of the gold standard) may yet be loath to give them up. This
leads to Proposition 3.

5. Policies That chieve a Stationary Shadow ExchanQe Rate Process
Thus far the stochastic process governing the forcing variables D,
and Z (given in 20a, b, c) and the stochastic process governing the
shadow floating exchange rate S (given in (23)) have been Wiener

t

processes with drift. Such processes are non—stationary. Specifically,
with a constant variance parameter

w6(t)

where dw9(t)

and drift p, S(t) = S(0) +

+

31

The variance of 5(t) therefore increases linearly with t and S is
=

nonstationary even if

0.

We maintain the assumption that Z(t) is governed by the Wiener
process with drift given in (2Cc), but permit the policy instruments to
be governed by linear feedback rules that relate dce to the state

variable S. For simplicity we assume that the feedback rules are exact
or non—stochastic, i.e. that the only sources of noise in the system are

the money demands in the two countries, Z(t>. D(t) and D*(t) can be
managed in such a way that F(t)

is therefore rather straightforward (technically) tc design dce

feedback rules that turn the original non—stationary shadow exchange

rate process into the stationary process given in (39). The fact that
(39) is stationary does not, however, resolve the problem of
non—viability of the gold standard.

Proposition 5.

The gold standard whbse shadow exchange rate is governed by the
stationary process in (39) will collapse in finite time with probability
•1.

Proof: The first order linear stochastic differential equation
whose forcing variable is a Wiener process is known as the

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O.U.) process. In Cox and Miller Cl95, p. 23343 it
is shown that the stationary O.U. process is recurrent, i.e. any state
is reached from any other state in finite time with probability 1.

•Hence given any nitial state S0, 0 <

< K, the barriers will be

reached in finite time with probability one. This proposition can be
extended to higher order stationary linear stochastic processes with
constant coefficients.

34

6. Flexible dce Rules and the Viability of a Gold Standard
From equation (15b) it is apparent that there exist policies for D
and

that ensure that the shadow floating exchange rate will never

break through its upper or lower barrier. Policies that fix S at any
value between 0 and K preclude a speculative run on either currency. To
achieve this, both the drift p5 (given in (2'+a) and the variance

parameter o (given in (24b)) must be set equal to zero. To set the
drift equal to zero does not require any special technical ability of

the policy makers. Any values of p and

satisfying p —

= —will

do, and the policy can be specified in an open—loop or non—contingent
manner.

To reduce the variance parameter to zero, however, requires a

highly contingent or conditional policy rule. It is e.g. not sufficient
for the authorities merely to refrain from adcing additional 'noise' to
the systern, by following a non—stochastic open—lpop rule with

From (24b> this would leave the variance of the shadow exchange

shocks to relative money demand growth. For

to equal zero, D(t)

and/or D11(t) must be stochastic, (a2 and/or

covariance parameters a

and a
cnosen to satisfy

designed which ensure that the forcing variable in the shadow exchange
rate process is constant over time, i.e. that dF(t) = 0 or

35

(40) d(D(t> —

D*(t))

—dZ(t) for all t.

This perfect automatic stabilizer instantaneously matches any
(random) excess of home country money demand growth over foreign country
money demand growth with an equal excess of home country domestic credit

expansion over foreign country domestic credit expansion. There never
is any net movement of reserves between the two monetary authorities.

Fiscal fspects of DCE Rules Consistent With the Survival of a Gold
Standard

that, as long as the fixed exchange rate regime survives and i =

36

(42) d(B — B*) = ——dZ

i.e. relative public debts is a Wiener process (without drift). The
stabilization of the shadow exchange rate appears to be achieved only at
the expense of the destabilization of the public debts of the two
countries.

We assume that each country has an upper bound on its public debt,

B for the home country and B* for the foreign country. B > B means a

home country default on its public debt; B > B means insolvency of the

foreign government.

Thus far we have characterized, in (40) and (42), the behaviour of
D —

and B — B*.

benchmark 'tsymmetric' specification of the

behaviour of each of the national authorities which is consistent with
(40) is that each country's dce equals the growth in the demand for that
country's money due to real output growth, i.e.

Such an upper bound exists when there is no Ricardian debt
neutrality, the nominal interest rate exceeds the growth rate of nominal
taxable capacity and there are limits on the magnitude of the future
primary surpluses and the future flow of seigniorage revenues that can
be achieved.
more general model would specify these limits in terms
of e.g. public debt — national income ratios, but nothing crucial is
lost if we interpret our model as one characterized by zero long run
real growth and inflation [see also fn3].

A policy of accommodating shocks to money demand due to variations
in real output (thus avoiding any net flow of international reserves and
fixing S) and of balancing the budget (44

a,b)

will therefore result in

the national debt following a Wiener process if real output follows a
Wiener process.

If the Wiener process for y (y*) has no drift, then B (B*) will
exceed any finite upper limit with probability 1 in finite time, and the

authorities will have to default on their debt. If y (y ) has negative
drift, it is true a fortiori that any finite upper bound on B (B*) will
be reached in finite time with probability 1.

one.

Such a financing policy (a balanced budget policy corrected for

processes (45 a, b) which now become Wiener processes without drift. As
was pointed out already, this. liconservativehl open—loop rule entails

government default in finite time with probability one.

The risk of a

foreign exchange crisis is eliminated, but an eventual government
solvency crisis has become a certainty.

To ensure that the critical gold reserve thresholds will not be

violated and that debt default is ruled out, the primary deficit 1

will have to be varied in response to exogenous shocks. The simplest
policy that guarantees survival of the gold standard and government
solvency is one where the primary deficit adjusts continuously to
accommodate all real income—related changes in money demand, i.e.

International liquidity and public sector solvency are

made certain by adopting a set of highly contingent or conditional dce
and primary deficit rules.

While the rule given here is not the only one consistent with a

viable gold standard and government solvency, any viable rule must be

capable of eliminating the posibility that independent shocks will
cumulate in ways that threaten lower or upper bounds on certain asset

stocks. Another policy which rules out the possibility of running out
of gold reserves and which does not require the instantaneous matching
of dce and money demand changes, is to let reserves decline freely to
some given level a5ove the minimum threshold level (RMIN +

r,

r > 0 for

the home country, say) and to engage in a stock—shift open market sale

of government bonds whenever RMIN +
would restore reserves to

+

r',

r

is reached. The open market—sale

r' > r, say. If both countries

were to pursue such a policy, the process governing the shadow floating
exchange rate would become a Wiener process between reflecting barriers.
To prevent these discrete open market sales from cumulating into

unsustainable public debt growth, the primary deficit will have to

respond to variations in debt service. This mean that all viable rules
are feedback, contingent or conditional rules.

I summarize this as:

Proposition .

In

order to rule out both the collapse of the gold standard and a

public sector solvency crisis, both monetary policy (dce or stock—shift

L4i

open market operations) and fiscal policy (variations in the primary
deficit) will have to be specified through contingent or conditional
r u I es.

Cone lus ion

The idealized two—country gold standard studied in this paper turns.
out to lack long—run viability unless monetary and fiscal policy are
used very flexibly to offset the effects of independent exogenous shocks
on international reserves and the public debt.
Absent a flexible dee policy which offsets the effect of money
demand shocks on the stock of reserves, the gold standard collapses in

finite time with probability 1. This collapse occurs through a
speculative selling attack against one of the two countries' currencies,
which brings that country's stock of gold reserves to its critical

minimal threshold level. 4hen this happens the monetary authority ends
convertibility of the currency ircto gold at a fixed parity and a period
of free floating commences.

Even when an eventual collapse is certain, there are once-off

monetary and fiscal policy actions that can raise the expected duration

of the li-fe of the gold standard. An increase in the exogenous stock
o-f international reserves (through a gold discovery or through the

issuing of 'paper gold" (S.D.R.'s) by a supranational monetary
authority> raises the expected survival period of the gold standard.
For any given global stock of reserves, there exists an initial
distribution of reserves that maximizes the gold standard's expected

42

lifetime. This distribution can be achieved through (stock—shift) open
market operations and adjustments in public sector primary non—interest

deficits. Expected dce (the 'drift" of the domestic credit stock
process) can be adjusted by the monetary authorities to alter the
Hdriftl• of international reserves and of the "shadow floating exchange

rate" whose behaviour determines the timing of the collapse and the
currency that will be the subject of a selling attack.

The behaviour of international reserves in the "viable range" where
each country's stock of reserves exceeds its critical threshold value,
can in general be mapped into the behaviour of a shadow floating

exchange rate between two absorbing barriers. The results summarized
thus far hold for a world in which the exogenous variables (domestic
credit and money demand) follow Wiener processes with or without drift.
When the exogenous variables are governed by Wiener processes, the

shadow exchange rate is also a Wiener process. Since Wiener processes
are non—stationary, it may be thought that the certainty of collapse in
finite time is duet to that specific feature of the model. This is not

the case. Fairly simple dce feedback rules relating national dce
differences to the level of the shadow floating exchange rate can

transform the shadow floating exchange rate proces into a stationary
stochastic process. The proposition that a critical reserve threshold
will be breached in finite time with probability 1 remains valid even
for stationary shadow exchange rate processes.

Finally, I consider flexible dce rules which permit domestic credit
expansion to respond instantaneously to real income—related money demand

43

shocks. While this stops the movement of reserves, it will create

public debt problems. If e.g. the authorities follow a balanced budget
policy, money demand shocks will, when matched by variations in domestic

credit, be reflected one-for—one in the public tebt. If there is an
upper bound on the level of public debt consistent with government

solvency, this upper bound is likely to be breached eventually. If the
authorities follow a budgetary policy of running a deficit or surplus
equal to the trend growth of money demand (i.e. equal to the trend
non—inflationary seigniorage that can be raised) a solvency crisis is
certain in finite time.

To prevent both reserve thresholds and public debt ceilings from
being breached, flexible dce policy and a flexible use of the primary
(non—interest) public sector deficit are required in this model.

Viability of the idealized gold standard analysed here requires the

active and flexible support of monetary and fiscal policy. Even prima
facie 'sound' unconditional monetary and fiscal rules such as : no
sterilization of balance—of payments deficits or surpluses and a
balanced budget, are inconsistent with the gold standard's long—run

survival. This vulnerability of the gold standard should not come asa
surprise of those who have studied the theory and history of commodity
stabilization schemes which attempt to stabilize the price of some
commodity by purchasing for or selling from a. buffer stock. Formally,
the gold standird is essentially an extreme version of such a commodity
stabilization scheme, as it aims not merely to stabilize but to fix the

price of a commodity. The same laws of probability that cause the

4,4

eventual collapse of commodity stabilization schemes, most

recently

in

the case of tin, jeopardize the long—run viability of a gold standard.

An issue which remains to be investigated is the extent to which
the conclusions of this paper carry over to the case where international
reserves consist (perhaps in part) of the liabilities of one or more of
the national monetary authorities and carry a market—determined rate of
interest. .Jhen reserves can be borrowed with little or no financial

penalty, the distinction between liquidity crises and solvency crises
becomes blurred, and we should only expect to see a run on a nation's
currency as one aspect of a default crisis affecting the whole of that
nation's public debt.
