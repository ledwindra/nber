International Policy Coordination in
Dynamic Macroeconomic Models
ABSTRACT

Recent analyses of the gains to policy coordination have focussed on the

strategic aspects of macroeconomic policymaking in a static setting. A major
theme is that noncooperative policy making is likely to be Pareto inefficient

because of the presence of beggar—thy—neighbor policies. This paper extends the
analysis to a dynamic setting, thereby introducing three important points of

realism to the static game. First, the payoffs to beggar—thy—neighbor policies
look very different in one—period and multiperiod games, and thus so do the

gains to coordination. Second, we show that policy coordination may reduce economic welfare if governments are nyopic in their policy making, as is sometimes

claimed. Third, governments act under a fundamental constraint that they cannot
bind the actions of later governments, and we investigate how this constraint
alters the gains to policy coordination.

Introduction
In an earlier essay (Oudiz and Sachs, 19814) we investigated the quanti-

tative gains to international policy coordination in a static environment. In
this paper, we begin to extend the analysis to a dynamic setting. However,
because of several new methodological issues, this first step is more theoretical
than empirical. The extension to dynamics introduces three important points of'
realism to the static game. First, the payoffs to beggar—thy—neighbor policies
may look very different in one—period and nultiperiod games, so that the need

for policy coordination may be different in the two games. Second, it is often
claimed that governments are shortsighted in macroeconomic planning, and
support for this view has come from the literature on political business

cycles.1 We should therefore investigate whether international policy
coordination is likely to exacerbate or meliorate this shortsighted behavior.

Third, governments act under a fundamental constraint that they cannot bind the
actions of later governments (or even of themselves at a future date). In
principle, therefore, optimizing governments mist take into account how future
governments will behave in view of the economic environment that they inherit.

We study the implications for policy coordination of this inability to bind
future governments.

Let us consider these three points in turn. In the static game,
uncoordinated macroeconomic policy—making is typically inefficient because of a

prisoner's dilemma in policy choices. Consider, for example, two countries that
are attempting to move optimally along a short—run Phillips curve. It may be
that each country will choose contractionary policies no matter what the other
country selects, though the policy pair (expand, expand) is better for both

—2—

countries than the non—cooperative equilibrium (contract, contract). As we
showed in our earlier study, this situation arises naturally under flexible
exchange rates, since by contracting while the other country is expanding, a

country can appreciate its currency and export some of its inflation abroad. It
is this beggar—thy—neighbor action that gives rise to the prisoner!s dilemma.
Cooperation, say in the form of a binding international commitment to expand,

may be useful in moving the countries to the efficient equilibrium.
The question arises whether the payoff structure in a niiltiperiod, or

infinite—horizon game will look the same. The reason for doubt is simple.
In almost all macroeconomic models, policies which lead to a short—run real
appreciation also lead to long—run real depreciation, or at least a return to

the initial real exchange rate. In this circumstance, farsighted players would
understand that a short—run beggar—thy—neighbor appreciation is less attractive
than it looks, since it will be reversed in the long run, at which point the
country reimports the inflation that it earlier sent abroad. To this extent,
the beggar—thy—neighbor policy loses its appeal, and the need for coordination
is reduced.

The second theme introduced in a rinltiperiod setting is the nvopic

behavior of governments. In considering public welfare in a nnltiperiod game,
it is natural to consider a payoff of the form:
(1)

=

ETt(T1)

Here, U is the intertemporal utility of country i as of time zero. u(T) is
the instantaneous utility of the country at time t, as a function of a vector

of macroeconomic targets T.

is a pure rate of time preference, with S C 1,

—3—

so that the future is discounted relative to the present.
In view of the evidence on political business cycles, in which governments
attempt
natural

to nanipulate T in conjunction with upcoming elections, it seems
to suggest that if (i) is the "true" social welfare function, the

government's social welfare function takes the form:
(2)

=

where

C T and

C S. That is, its planning horizon is shorter than the

econort,r's, or its discounting of the future is higher.

In this view,

the

public is partly a hostage of a self—serving government.

The policy choices reflect the incumbent government's goals, and not the

public's. If this is so, we can ask whether international policy coordination
is likely to improve or worsen this sub—optimal situation. At an abstract
level, the arguments seem to fall on both sides. Some critics, for example,
have characterized policy coordination as a cartel of the incumbents, in which
each policymaker helps the others to nanipulate the political business cycle.

As an example of this, policymakers may have a short—run expansionary bias if
expansion shows up as output today and as inflation only many years in the

future. To some extent, the fear of currency depreciation following a
unilateral expansion keeps this bias in check. That is, the flexible exchange
rate provides discipline on the shortsighted government. With policy
coordination, the fear of currency depreciation can be removed by a commitment

of all countries to expand. In this way, policy coordination may give incumbent
governments a free hand to undertake overly inflationary policies.

—'4—

On the other hand, we can

think

of circumstances in which policy

coordination ties the hand of incumbents, and thus prevents such self-serving

policies. An international gold standard, for example, might impose discipline
on governments that would not exist in each country alone. To analyze this
possibility fully we would have to examine each government's incentive to stick
with a particular rule, and the extent to which internationally certified rules

are more or less durable than rules undertaken unilaterally. For example, each
country on its own could adopt a gold standard. What, if anything, is added by
a nulticountry commitment?

The third theme introduced in a nultiperiod setting is that of "time—

consistency" of optimal plans. Even in circumstances in which the current
government (or current administration) has the public's interest at heart, its
ability to nuximize social welfare nay be limited by its inability to pre—coinmit

the actions of (well—meaning) future governments. In these circumstances, the
current government must choose its optimal policy taking as given the policy

rules that will be pursued in the future. That is, it mast optimize today,
assuming that future governments will optimize under the assumption that yet

future governments will optimize, and so on. In general this constrained
optimization yields a lower level of social welfare than does the case in which

the government can choose not only its own policies but those of future
governments as well.

Many authors, including Barro and Gordon (1983) and Rogoff (1983), have
given examples in which the inability to bind future policies imparts an

inflationary bias to the econorw. In these examples, wage setters set wages

—5—

before macroeconomic policy is set. Once the wages are set, policymakers have
an incentive to expand the econonv to reduce real wages, and raise output. Wage
setters anticipate these policies, and choose inflationary wage settlements in

anticipation. If the government can pre—commit to avoid inflationary policies,
the econOnw can get the same ex post output levels at a lower rate of inflation.
Unfortunately, such a pre—coinmitment is not credible since the government has an

incentive to renege on it after the wages are set.

As Rogoff stresses, this time consistency problem nay have important

consequences for international policy coordination. If the inability to bind
future policies leads to an inflationary bias, international policy coordination
may further exacerbate this bias by eliminating each country's concern about

currency depreciation. Thus, even when a sequence of governments within each
country is trying to maximize that country's true social welfare function,
policy coordination nay make the situation worse rather than better.
We consider later on several factors that tend to weaken this pessimistic

conclusion. First, in infinite—horizon games, governments nay be able to invest
in a "reputation" in order to overcome the time—inconsistency problem (as

illustrated in Barro and Gordon (1983)). In other words, a government's
credibility may be judged by its willingness to honor a program laid down by an
earlier government, so nuch that it continues the policy rather than

reoptimizing during its incumbency. We will provide an example of this
solution to the time inconsistency problem. Second, to the extent that the time
inconsistency problem revolves around the exchange rate, policy coordination nay

actually eliminate the problem. In examples later in the paper, optimal

—6—

coordinated policies in our a two—country nrdel turn out to be time—consistent.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we set out a
simple dynamic macroeconomic model characterized by flexible exchange rates and

perfect foresight on the part of the private and public sectors. In
Section III, we describe various equilibria in a one—country version of the

model, to highlight the implications of time inconsistency. Next, in Section
IV, we describe the various equilibria in the two—country version of the game,

including the welfare gains or losses from policy coordination. Extensions and
conclusions are discussed in a final section.

II. k Simple Dynamic Macroeconomic Model
We consider a simple model of the sort explored by Dornbusch (l9J6). The
home country produces output Q, at price F, and trades with a foreign country,

which produces Q* at price P. The domestic exchange rate E measures units of
home currency per unit of foreign currency, so that the relative price of the

home good is F/EP*. Demand for the home good is a decreasing function of P/EP*
and of the real interest rate, and an increasing function of Q*• Letting lower
case variables p, q, and e represent the logarithms of their upper—case
counterparts, we write demand for home goods as:

(3)

=

—

o[i_(p+1_ptfl

+

Here, i is the nominal interest rate, and i —

rate at time t (p1 is the expectation of

yq
the home real interest

at time t). Under the perfect

foresight assumption, which we hereafter maintain, p1 =

for

all t

The money demand equations take the standard transactions form:

For convenience, we will invert this equation and write

and p =

P(Ifl—p)

1/c.

Following Dornbusch, we assume perfect capital

mobility, so that uncovered interest arbitrage holds:

e+1_eit_i

(6)

Again, assuming perfect foresight, we solve for equilibria with e1 =

for

all t.

It remains to specify wage and price dynamics. First, the (log) consumer
price index (nc) is written as a weighted average of home (p) and foreign
(p*+e) prices:
(7)

p = Xp

+

(l_X)(p+e)

Home prices are written as a fixed markup over wages:
(8)

Finally, nominal wage change, w+1 — w1, is made a function of lagged nominal

price change, p —

(9)

p1,

output, and output change:

+

t+l-t =

Note that since w1 —

is

+6

a function of lagged rather than contemporaneous

price change, the system will display typical Keynesian features, particularly
the non—neutrality of

with respect to contemporaneous and future anticipated

changes in tnt. This is the standard presumption in the Dornbusch model that the

—8—

labor market clears more slowly than the asset markets.

In the next section, we will introduce corresponding equations for the

second country, in order to construct a two—country model. Here, we focus on
the one—country case by making the small—country assumption for the home economy

that p, i, and q* are given for all t

0. By doing so, we can write the

one—country model as a four—dimensional difference equation system as in (10):2

are given by the past history of the

econoritr. These are the "pre—detennined" variables of the economy. rn and

indeed the entire sequence of m, is chosen as a policy variable. p, i, and
are exogenous forcing variables of the system from the point of view of the
home economy.

As is typical of perfect foresight models, an asset price such as e is
determined not by past history but by forward—looking behavior of asset holders.
In particular, for given values of
ii',

and q* from t

to

p1 ,

and given sequences of p,

infinity, there is typically a unique value of e

such

that

exchange rate does not grow or collapse explosively (technically, this
unique value of e puts the economy on its stable manifold). Such a unique
value of e exists as long as the eigenvalue associated with e in the A matrix is
the

is

outside of the unit circle, and the remaining eigenvalues are on or within

—9—

the unit circle. In the simulations reported below, this condition is always
satisfied.

The goal of economic policy in our model will be to naximize a social

welfare function as in (i) or (2), subject to the constraint in (10). The
assumption that e is always such as to keep the econonw on the saddlepoint path
(or stable innifold) requires that economic agents have complete knowledge as to

the path of future policies. In this sense, the government is like a
Stackelberg leader with respect to the private sector, choosing monetary policy

with a view to affecting e and thereby more basic economic targets, while e is
chosen taking as given the future sequence of m. This is not to say, however,

that governments can necessarily choose any sequence of m that they desire. A
large part of the discussion that follows describes the "admissible" sequences
of policies.

As a concrete example of this model, we will suppose that instantaneous

utility u(T) is a quadratic function of inflation,

p p1,

deviation of output from full employment q. That is, u =

and the

is the discount factor. We have written the utility function with an infinite
horizon, and we will point out shortly some special features of the problem that
arise with such a formulation.

We now turn to the optimal policy for m. It may seem straightforward to

—10—

maximize (11) subject to (io), but as Phelps and Pollak (1968) first explained,

and Kydland and Prescott (1917) further elucidated, the maximization is quite
problematic. Here we sketch the problem, and treat it in greater detail below.
Suppose that we apply optimal control techniques to the problem of

maximizing U0 subject to (10), taking as given p0, p, q1. For simplicity,

we set p =

i

= 0 for all t

=

0. The result of this straightforward

control problem will be an infinite sequence m0,m1,..., denoted hereafter

that maximizes U0. Let us write this optimal choice of monetary policy as

We have already noted that e0 will in general be a function of p0, c1, q1
and the entire sequence fii}0. The first step of this sequence is

e,

p0, c1, and q1, we can use (io) to find p, p0, q0. Suppose

now that at time 1 the policymakers reoptimize, in order to maximize U 1subject

will

not equal rn for t > 1, so that the

government at time 1 will not want to carry on with the optimal plan as of time

zero. If the government at time 1 is not bound (e.g. by a constitution) to
carry out

the

earlier plan will be scrapped.

As Kydland and Prescott stressed, we cannot simply assume away this

problem by letting the initial government choose %,

the

next choose m1, etc.;

i.e. by letting each succeeding government optimize anew, using the optimal
control solution (this is close to what Buiter (1983) proposes, incorrectly we
believe, as discussed below). The problem is iruch deeper, for the following

reason. The choice

is optimal only under the assumption that it is followed

by th1,th2,... It has no particular attractiveness given that it will be

followed by m1 and other

*

for t > 2. Moreover, the exchange rate e0

—11—

will be a function not of

,

as the original government's solution assumed,

but rather of the actual m that will be selected.
Phelps and Pollak, and Kydland and Prescott, provided the answer to this

difficulty. Unless the original government can act to bind all future
governments, it nust optimize with the full knowledge that all future

governments will be free to optimize. A time consistent equilibrium is one in
which each government optimizes its policy choice taking as given the policy

rules (or specific policy actions) that future governments will use. With a
finite time horizon, such an optimization is easy to carry out. Let
xT represent the inherited state of the econonzr in the final period T. In our
example xT would be the vector <PT'
the best policy

fT(xT)

Given XT it is easy to find

that maximizes LT sTij. At time T—l, the

penultimate government knows that its successor will follow

fT(xT).

It

is then an easy task to maximize ET Tu subject to (10) and the constraint
=

This second optimization will yield the nile

that is optimal given the rules that succeeding administrations will follow.
Such rules will be credible to the private sector (e.g. the asset holders in the
foreign exchange market) because each government is doing the best that it can
given the freedom of action of future governments.

In an infinite—horizon setting, the solution of the time—consistency issue

is a bit nore complex, as we shall soon see. The problem is that there is
likely to be a multiplicity, perhaps an infinity, of policy rules that have the

property that they are optimal given that future governments will also choose

—12—

the rule. There is an embarrassing abundance of time—consistent policies. Not
only is it hard to find all of these solutions, but

it

is not necessarily

straightforward to choose among them.

In summary, there are typically two types of equilibria in imltiperiod

planning problems. The first type assumes that the initial government can
pre—commit to an entire sequence of moves, or to a policy rule. For this type
of problem, optimal contrcl suffices. The second type of problem nore
realistically assumes that each government can nake its "move," but cannot bind

the hand of future governments. It must therefore optimize, taking as given the
freedom of choice of future governments. Before proceeding to the imiticountry
setting, it is useful to study some more technical aspects of these two
approaches.

Pre—commitnient Equilibria

There are two types of

pre—conmitment

equilibria. In the first, the

government selects an entire sequence jm} that by assumption will be carried
out at all future dates. In the second, the initial government selects a rule
=

that is also assumed to bind all future governments. The

first equilibrium is termed an open—loop solution, and the second, a closed—loop

solution. Both solutions will tend to be time—inconsistent, except in special
cases, in the sense that future governments will want to deviate from the

original sequence (in the open—loop case), or the original rule (in the
closed—loop case), even if they believe that other governments would abide by
the original plans.

—13—

now calculate the optimal open—loop equilibrium in order to pinpoint the

positive, meaning that an increase in e would raise welfare. From the point of
view of the government at time t = 3 (1987), for example, the original plan is

too contractionary, since a currency depreciation would raise welfare. A new
optimization at t = 3 would lead to a new sequence jrn}0, with in3 >

speaking,

0, has an incentive to announce a stern set of

future monetary policies in order to induce a currency appreciation at t = 0,

and thereby to reduce 1l (which is otherwise very high). Of course, e0 can be
and

reduced by extremely low in0 and higher in for t ) 1, or by more ncderate

somewhat lower rn for t ) 1. The optimal policy is to opt for nderate

and

low future in, rather than extremely restrictive in0, since the approach with

restrictive future m achieves the same currency appreciation with a somewhat
lower loss of initial output, q0.

Thus, from the perspective at t =

0, it is worthwhile to commit future in to

low values for the sake of e0. However, from the perspective of future
governments, e3 is a bygone, and in should reflect tradeoffs in the present and

future, not the past. Thus, by the tine a future government assumes office,
part of the original incentive to keep in low has disappeared, and the new
optimization in period t consequently yields a higher value of in.

It is interesting to note that there is a single special case in which the
open—loop policy is also tine consistent, and that is when a = 0 in the original

model (i.e. output is not affected by the real interest rate). In that case,
E 0 satisfies the equation for

so that there is no reason to prefer

one path of m over another as long as they both lead to the same e0. The same

is true about all future e. This property allows the original government to
specify a path

that all future governments will be content to honor.

The open—loop equilibrium is the best pre—commitment equilibrium available.

It is sometimes argued, however, that while governments cannot credibly
pre—commit future governments to a sequence of policy nnves, they nay be able to

pre—commit governments to a specific policy rule for m. Such a closed—loop
rule might not be as good as the open—loop result, but it might be better than

no rule at all. There is some merit to this argument, as we shall soon see.
The rule can of course be of varying complexity. We illustrate this case by
choosing a simple rule, which links rn to the current state of the economy, as

described by the vector x

q1>. Such a rule is termed memoryless, in

that the past history of the economy, in arriving at

<PtPtiQl>, is not

permitted to affect In. We simplify further by specifying ni as a linear

function of t't—l' and

Our method of solution is straightforward. A solution of the form (13) is
guessed. Using (10) and the assumption that e0 places the economy on the stable
manifold, we find U3 as a function of the rule. Implicitly then

U0 =

u0(0,1,e2,3).

Using a standard numerical optimization technique, we

then proceed to maximize U0 with respect to o'l'2'3' to arrive at the

Time—Consistent Equilibria
The previous equilibria depend on the unsatisfactory assumption that future

governments can be bound by rules made at an earlier date. Some writers have
suggested that macroeconomic policies must therefore be formulated as

constitutional rules, in order to bind successfully at a later date. For many
reasons, including conflicting views about the correct rules, unwillingness to
tamper with a constitution, and the realization that even constitutions can be
amended at a later date, there is little likelihood the macroeconomic policy

will soon be etched in constitutional stone. In practice, therefore,
governments nust operate with the knowledge that future governments have freedom
to change course and will have incentives to do so, relative to the open—loop
or closed—loop optimum, even when the future governments share the goals of the
earlier governments.

In this circumstance, we can reformulate the policy problem as a game among
an infinite number of players (i.e., governments), who are identified by the

time period in which they act. The initial nove is made by the government at t
= 0 (hereafter G0), then by G1, and so on. The payoff functions for Gt is

Eit Ut(T), and the move is m.

Now, we can think of various types of' Nash equilibria among these

governments. In analor to the pre—commitment case, we can think of Nash

—22—

equilibria in which each government takes as given the moves of other
governments, or Nash equilibria in which each government takes as given policy

rules of other governments. A Nash equilibrium in moves will be called
"open—loop," and a Nash equilibrium in strategies or policy rules will be called
"closed—loop."

Consider first the case of open—loop Nash equilibrium. Let {zn} t denote
the sequence of moves before and after, but not including, period t:

performing the optimization at period t, the government assumes that e

that the resulting path is not a Nash equilibrium among the infinite sequence of

governments (this was verified in Figure 3). Taking as given that other

In general, there will be r.ny such Nash equilibria, some of which (as we shall
see) are not very desirable.

ks is typical in such circumstances, we further refine the nature of the

equilibrium to include only Nash perfect equilibria. A strategy sequence
is said to be a perfect equilibrium if for any history of the econonbr from time

t (even histories not resulting from a Nash equilibrium during periods

We now define time consistency:

In general, open—loop Nash equilibria, as in (15), will not be perfect
equilibria. Suppose, for example, that the sequence nz.1,rn2,... has the Nash

property. In most models, including those in our paper, the sequence
will not be subgame Nash (starting at period 2), if m1 is set

differently from m1. Thus, from this point on, we restrict our search for
time—consistent equilibria to closed—loop Nash equilibria, in which governments
take as given the policy rules of other governments.

Unfortunately, even the perfectness concept does not eliminate the problem

of a multiplicity of equilibria. There will in general be many
consistent equilibria.

To narrow the search, we begin with the simplest case,

in which m is a function of the current state x

search to such "memoryless" strategies). Thus, we are searching for a function

Our strategy is to search for f among the class of linear functions.

rule is validated as a time—consistent policy. Starting at !flL period t and any
state t, the tth government will choose the I rule given that all future
governments will make that choice.

In general, the time—consistent rule nust be found numerically (see Cohen
and Michel (1984) for an elegant treatment of the one—dimensional case for the

state vector x, for which an analytical solution is found). To do so, we start

with a finite—period problem, in which Eo3tut. It is then easy to find the

periods remaining. Then it is a simple matter to find the limiting value of

f(x0) as T +

rule f(x0) =

f(x0) can then be verified directly to

have the time—consistency, Nash equilibrium property for the infinite—horizon

game. We provide details of this method in the Appendix.

policies reduce the inherited inflation to zero in the long nan.

Before turning to a welfare ranking of the various policies, we must note a

policies have the same cumulative output loss, no ratter what is the time

path of exchange rates, money, etc.! Thus, the welfare issue is always one of
timing, rather than the overall nagnitude of lost output.

On purely logical grounds, we can rank the welfare achieved by the three

policies so far studied: open—loop control, closed—loop control (with
pre—coinmitment), and time—consistent control. The open—loop control is clearly
first best, since both of the other solutions reflect the same optimization, but

under additional constraints. The closed—loop, linear feedback rule also nust
produce higher utility than the time—consistent rule. Both the linear rule and
time—consistent solution choose

as a linear function of x; the linear rule

is chosen as the best among this class of functions, so in particular it is

better than the time—consistent rule. Thus we know that

—31—

Buiter (1983) has recently proposed an alternative strate' for finding a
time—consistent linear rule (we describe his approach at length in the

appendix). His reasoning is as follows. Consider the open—loop control
solution, with shadow prices p1, u2, and p3 on the state variables, and

on the

exchange rate. At t = 0, the initial government chooses policies so that
=

p4,0

0.

For t > 0, we know that

will tend to deviate from zero. Each

government in period t would like to reset hu144 =

0.

Baiter proposes,

therefore, that a time—consistent solution is found by assuming that
for all t, and dropping the open—loop dynamic equation for

E 0

When this

procedure is followed, we obtain the following linear rule:
(29)

m = .237 p + .763 p1 + .229
There are two counts against this proposed solution. Most important,

it is simply not time consistent. If all governments for t > 1 adopt the Baiter
rule, the government at t = 0 would not choose this rule. By following the
procedures described earlier (for calculating the best rule at t = 0 for a given
rule at t ) 1) we find that the initial government would choose:
(30)

m0 = —.147 p0 + 1.147 c1 + .309

The logic underlying the Buiter solution seems problematic as well. The

merit for a government to choose p = 0 comes if the sequence of in
corresponding to

= 0 will in fact be carried out by future governments,

But, by construction, each succeeding government alters the chosen sequence of

m. There is simply no attraction to choosing

= 0 if the government knows

that its plans will not be carried forward. The private sector understands this
point perfectly, by setting e to correspond to the actual sequence of in rather

—32—

than to the sequence planned by each government. In a nutshell, Buiter's
government is naive in assuming that future governments will carry out its
open—loop optimum, at the same time that the private sector is completely on top
of the policy—making process, and knows that future governments will reoptimize.

Reputation and Tinae—Cnsistency
In the previous section we simplified our search for a time—consistent

policy to "memoryless" rules. Such rules nake m a function of the
contemporaneous state vector

but not of the past history of x and m. Many

policies in the real world depend on the history of a game as much as the

current state. In competitive environments, for example, aggressive behavior by
one player at time t—l might bring forward retaliation by others at period t, as
in

"tit—for--tat" strategies. Game theorists have long understood that such

history—dependent strategies can help competing players to achieve rmre

efficient outcomes than those obtainable from memoryless strategies alone.

It

turns out that similar complex strategies can help a sequence of

governments to achieve a better equilibrium than the one obtained by the

memoryless rule m =

1(x).

Consider a compound rule of the sort:

(31) (a) Government t chooses its policy according to

=

(x)

as long as

all governments j C t have also selected policy this way;

(b) If any government j C t selects
=

1(x).

m

* g(x), then government t selects

where f is the menoryless, time—consistent rule.

Suppose now that the rule (x) is better than 1(x) in the sense that if' all

—33—

governments t ) 0 choose g(x) they achieve utility

>

U.

Also, suppose that

itself is not time consistent in the sense of (19): If all governments

t >1 are known to choose (x), it is not optimal for the government at t = 0 to
select g(x0).

The surprising result is that while (x) is not time consistent, a
compound strategy like (3l)(a)—(b) can be time consistent with the result that

all governments end up playing g(x) leading to higher social welfare. In the
memoryless time—consistency problem, each government takes as given the choice

of policy rule followed by future governments. If future governments are going

to choose m =

g(x),

the current government nay have no particular incentive to

choose g. With a compound rule as in (31), the government at time t knows that
it affects the policy rule selected by future governments. It takes as given
the two—part decision mechanism (a)—(b), but it recognizes that if it is the

first government to deviate from (x) it will cause all future governments to

choose f(x) instead of (x). Since

> U1'

by assumption, this deviation from

g(x) imposes a cost, which deters the government from deviating from
Thus, each government operates under a "threat" that future governments

will revert to f(x) if the current government fails to play m =

(x).

Game

theorists have long recognized that such a threat mechanism is viable only if

the reversion to 1(x) is credible. For example, suppose that the rule is "let
money growth obey the open—loop strategy or else each future government lets

money grow by one million percent." If every government takes it as given that
future governments hold this rule, then noney growth will indeed obey the

—34—

open—loop strate' (governments would seek to avoid the hyperinflation that they
fear would otherwise ensue).A true intertemporal Nash equilibrium is obtained,

in which the open—loop sequence is carried out by every government. The problem
here, of course, is that the threat of hyperinflation is not rational. Surely,
if any government does violate the open—loop rule, the next government will not

exercise the threat. Knowing this, no government really has an incentive to
persist in the open—loop path.

Game theorists therefore restrict the threats to actions that would indeed

be carried out if deviations from (x) occur (even if, as in the example, the
threats need never actually be carried out). It is here that the assumption of
perfection of equilibrium becomes important. In the hyperinflation example just
cited, not all subgames are Nash, and thus the proposed equilibrium is not

perfect. To see this, suppose that G0 deviates. Even if G1 assumes that all
future governments will play the hyperinflation threat, it is not optimal for

government 1 to play the threat. Thus the subgame in which government 0
deviates, and all Gt

> 1 )

let

m grow by 1 million percent per period, is not

a Nash equilibrium. G1 can do better unilaterally, taking as given the actions

of other G.
As long as the reversion is to f(x), i.e. the threat is to return to the
time—consistent rule, the threat is credible. After all, if a government

believes that all future governments will play f(x) it is optimal for the
government itself to play f(x). Every subgame consisting of the infinite
sequence of governments playing f(x) is therefore a Nash equilibrium.
Now we argue that by this nchanism the sequence of governments can sustain

—35—

any linear rule

&(x),

as long as the utility from this rule is higher than

the utility from the nemoryless time—consistent rule for any x. We want to show,
therefore, that the following strate for each government constitutes a perfect

that all future governments will play f(x) it is optimal for the government in

question to choose m =

as well, by the definition of f. In other words,

if a government is going to deviate, the best deviation is simply to revert to

f(x) immediately. Thus, the cost of defecting from the m =

In an important sense, then, the time inconsistency problem is exaggerated,
in that nany "pre—commitment" equilibria can probably be sustained even in

situations where actions of future governments cannot be bound. The memoryless
time—consistent equilibrium is the lower limit of what can be obtained by a

sequence of governments, not the only outcome. We should stress, however, that
time consistency does impose costs, since the first—best, open—loop strategy

almost surely cannot be sustained as a perfect equilibrium. The reason is as
follows. Suppose that the sequence of governments pursues the open—loop solution

III. Policy Coordination in the Two—Country Model
The first part of the paper has dealt with economic policy in a single
econouzy. We now extend the same set of techniques to a two—country setting.

The goal is to compare "non—cooperative" equilibria (NC), in which each country
optimizes while taking as given the policies abroad, with "cooperative"
equilibria (c), in which binding commitments can be nade between the two

countries. Fornally, we treat the cooperative case as one in which a single
controller chooses the policies of the two countries. As in the early section,
we imist treat two separate types of equilibria: (i) the pre—commitmnent case, in

which the two countries (in NC) or the single controller (in C), can credibly
pre—commit to a rule or to an infinite sequence of actions; and (2) the
time—consistent

case, in which no pre—commitment in future periods is possible.

We turn first to the pre—commitment case.

The open—loop case is most easily dealt with. We, firBt

append a symmetric

foreign—country model to the home—country model just discussed. The model is
shown in Table 2. In the NC solution, each government at t = 0 solves for an
optimal sequence of monetary policies taking as given the sequence selected from
abroad. In the C solution-, a single controller chooses

and jm*}0

to

maximize a weighted average of intertemporal utilities at home and abroad. In
view

of

the symmetry

assumed between the countries, jm}0 will equal {m*} as a

feature of both solutions, with the adjustment paths at home and abroad identical.

The key result is that non—cooperative control leads to over—contractionary

anti—inflation policies relative to the social optimum. Both countries are made
better off by a coordinated policy of less rapid disinflation.

In general, the dimensionality of the control problem is too high to

analyze the NC case analytically. An important special case, however, allows us
to establish analytically the key

features

of the NC versus C solutions. Since

the findings are insightful, we begin with that special case. In particular, we
first

(a

assume that aggregate demand and money demand are not interest sensitive
=

0 in the original model). This simplification allows us to determine

as a function of the current state vector together with

and m, rather

than as a forward—looking variable dependent on the entire future sequence of

policies. Also, to reduce further the dimensionality, we set 0 = 0, so that
wage change depends on the level of output but not its lagged rate of change.

In other words, a real depreciation between periods t and t+1 causes

inflation to accelerate, basically because real import prices rise. Carrying

out the same manipulation for the foreign country yields n1 =

(rt+i_rt) +

that a real depreciation at home causes inflation to

fall abroad, while an appreciation at home causes foreign inflation to rise.

Here is the nub of the coordination problem: each country may have an incentive
to contract the econonr in order to appreciate the currency and thereby export

inflation abroad at the expense of the other country. Since the exchange rate
effects are bound to cancel out if each country chooses contractionary policies
to appreciate its currency, a coordinated policy can avoid the contractionary
policies, to the inatual benefit of both countries.

It only remains to determine r before solving for the two equilibria.
Subtracting the foreign aggregate demand schedule from the home schedule we
find:

r =

From (33), we see that the key to a real appreciation is to be more

contractionary than one's neighbor. The effort towards contraction leads to the
inefficiency of the non—cooperative outcome.

In any period, Pt and p are predetermined variables, so that the choice

thus indicates the importance of the "beggar—thy—neighbor" phenomenon, in which
each country (vainly) attempts to keep output lower at home than abroad in order

to export inflation. Since the single controller recognizes the futility of
each country, in a closed system, trying to export inflation, the controller
simply sets a =

0.

That is the root of the gain to cooperation.

illustrates the inflation and output paths of the home econonry under cooperation

and non—cooperation. The faster disinflation under NC is clearly brought about
by increased unemployment (i.e. reduced output) in the early years of the

disinflation process. Remember from our earlier discussion that the cumulative
output loss is the same for all paths that asymptotically reduce inflation to
zero.

Welfare Aspects of Cooperation
Assuming that governments are pursuing appropriate objectives (e.g. that
they use the "right" discount rate), it is easy to show that the cooperative

path, with less extreme disinflation, dominates the non—cooperative path. A
simple argument is as follows (direct computation would also make the same

point). Define the set of pareto efficient (E) pairs of sequences
that have the property that 1J0 is maximized given tJ, and

maximized given U0.

The cooperative solution, by construction, gives the sequence pair
corresponding to w =

0.5 (i.e. equal weighting of the countries). It is the

unique solution to the problem. Since the non—cooperative solution also
yields a symmetric equilibrium, with U0 =

U,

it mast be that U <

tJ,

since

otherwise the non—cooperative solution would pareto dominate a known pareto
efficient solution.

We mentioned in the introduction that some critics of cooperation are

dubious of the assumption that governments tximize the proper social welfare
function. In particular, plausible arguments have been made that the
government's discount rate

is less than the "true" B. If so, cooperation

might exacerbate rather than meliorate social welfare. The point is that
cooperation allows governments to pursue a more "leisurely" disinflation.

However, short—sighted governments might already be postponing the necessary

disinflation, in return for short—run gains to output. In an already distorted
policy environment, cooperation might further retard the necessary adjustment.
To examine this view, we computed the open—loop cooperative and
non—cooperative intertemporal utilities for a range of B', holding fixed the

"true" B at (l.l) (we use the simplified version of the two—country model for
these calculations). For each BG, we calculate the two equilibria and then
evaluate the social welfare of the resulting paths using B =

(l.l)_l.

As seen

from Figure 7 non—cooperation dominates cooperation when B0 is sufficiently
G
smaller than B, and cooperation dominates non—cooperation as long as B is

"close enough" or somewhat greater than B. Of course, for any B0 = B, open—loop
cooperation will necessarily be superior to open—loop non—cooperation. It is

Policy Coordination and Time Consistency
We now leave the case of open—loop control and return to the more realistic

assumption that governments cannot bind their successors. In the
non—cooperative setting we are looking for an equilibrium characterized by rules

=

f(x)

and m =

f*(Xg)

that have the following property: for the home

country, f is optimal at time t given that all future governments at home play f
and that abroad the contemporaneous and all future governments play fM; while

for the foreign country, 4 is optimal under the analogous conditions. Note
is the state vector including predetermined variables of both the home

that

and foreign economy. In particular,

=

<p, p, t—l 't_l' t—l' _1>

There are two key differences with the open—loop model previously

described. First, of course, is the inability of

and

to bind the

entire sequence of future moves. Second is the assumption that each government

as given the foreign rule rather than the foreign actions, so that optimal

takes

moves today

take into account the effects of today's actions on tomorrow's state

vector,

and thus on the foreign governments' moves. It would be possible

instead

to calculate a time—consistent inilticountry equilibrium in which each

government takes as given the sequence of future moves (i.e. open—loop time
consistency), but we have not pursued that choice here.

As in the one—country case, the time—consistent equilibrium is solved as

the limit of a backward recursion. (For the calculations that follow, we revert

—50—

to the complete two—country model, with non—zero values of a, C, and e). Using
the parameter values of the one—country model, we arrive at the following rules;

compares the paths of the home econonw output for the non—cooperative

open—loop and non—cooperative time—consistent equilibria. As in the one—country
model, output losses are smaller in the early periods for TC than OL. The
inability to bind one's successors causes a bias towards more expansionary
policies and thus more rapid inflation, relative to the open—loop solution.
Significantly, it is no longer possible to rank social welfare under
open—loop versus time—consistent policies (for non—cooperative equilibria), as

it was in the one—country model. Remember the argument in the one—country
context. Open—loop control, by definition, picks the optimal sequence;
time—consistent policy, on the other hand, reflects an optimization under

additional constraints and therefore is inferior to the open—loop control. In
the two—country setting, the same logic does not apply. The open—loop sequence
is no longer the optimal sequence. Indeed we have seen that open—loop,
non—cooperative control is typically pareto inefficient. There is no
presumption that adding constraints to the optimization will now lower welfare,

particularly since constraints re being added abroad as well as at home. It is
true that the home country can no longer pre—commit to a sequence of moves, but
now

neither

can the foreign country. It is true that the home country prefers

an open—loop to time consistent policy assuming that the other country is fixed

at one or the other. With the other country's policy fixed, an open—loop policy

at home can exactly replicate the time—consistent sequence, and presumably it
can do it better.

There are good economic reasons to believe that the time—consistent policy

may actually dominate the open—loop solution in the non—cooperative game. The
open—loop policy, we know, is over—contractionary relative to the efficient

equilibrium. Moving from open—loop control to time consistency causes policy to
become less contractionary and therefore pushes the econonw towards the
efficient equilibrium.

Now, let us consider the time—consistent cooperative equilibrium. Here we
imagine that a single controller each period sets m and m*, but now subject to

the time—consistency constraint. The single cooperative controller rmist
optimize while taking as giving the actions of single cooperative controllers in

later periods. We should like to determine whether time—consistent cooperation
is superior to time—consistent non—cooperation. As we have noted in several
places Rogoff (1983) has devised an ingenious example where cooperation reduces

welfare. Simply, time—consistency leads governments to be over—inflationary
relative to the open—loop pre—commitment equilibrium. Cooperation further
exacerbates this over—inflationary bias by removing each government's fear of
currency depreciation.

Interestingly, our results run counter to Rogoff's: cooperation is
superior in welfare terms to non—cooperation. While the cooperative solution is
more inflationary (see Figure 9), as we might expect, it is not overly inflation-

ary in a welfare sense. The less rapid disinflation merely corrects the
contractionary bias of the non—cooperative case. The key point here is as

follows. [n the symmetric country model, the single controller always adopts

symmetric rules so that e = 0 for all t. Since the exchange rate is the sole
potential source of time inconsistency in this model, and since it is always
equal to zero, the cooperative time—consistent solution is also the open—loop

cooperative solution. For a cooperative controller, there is no
time—consistency problem in our model (since the countries are symmetric). The
single controller can reach the first—best optimum solution for open—loop
cooperative control.
tn sum, we have shown examples where cooperative control is more
inflationary than open—loop non—cooperative control and time—consistent

non—cooperative control. In both cases, the cooperative solution is welfare
improving relative to the non—cooperative equilibrium. In view of Hogoff's
example, it will be difficult indeed to set out general principles on the gains

from cooperation under the constraint of time consistency. Comparing our
example with his, the key difference seems to rest on the source of the

time—consistency problem. In Rogoff's case, the problem arises from
forward—looking wage setters and cooperation exacerbates the problem. In our
model, the problem arises from forward—looking exchange market participants, and
cooperation eliminates the problem.

Conclusions

This study represents work in progress on the gains to coordination in

dynamic nacroeconomic models. Our focus has been purely methodological, and
preparatory to attempts at a quantitative assessment of international policy

—55—

coordination. The nEthodological issues arise from the wide variety of possible
equilibrium concepts in nulticountry dynamic games. The gaines can be solved
under the assumption of pre—commitment versus time—consistency; open—loop versus
closed—loop behavior; and non—cooperative versus cooperative decision—making.

These three dimensions are all independent, so any choice along each dimension
is possible.
Moreover, in some cases there nay be m.iltiple eq3lilibria. For example,

there are probably many time—consistent, non—cooperative equilibria that depend

on the "threat—reputation" mechanism outlined in the paper. As yet, we have
made no systematic attempt to search for such equilibria.
This work should now be used to gain empirical insight into the cooperation

issue. For all of the discussion surrounding time consistency, for example,
there is not a single empirical investigation of its importance in the

macroeconomics literature. Similarly, there are no reliable measures of the
gains to cooperation in the simpler, pre—commitment equilibria. Such
quantitative work deserves a high priority.

Appendix

We shall present in this appendix the derivation of the four policy rules

discussed in this paper. All of these rules are obtained as the stationary
limit of backward recursions using a methodo1or similar to Basar and Olsder
(1982) or Kydland (1975). The only significant difference with these authors is
the fact the followers' actions are represented here by a forwardlooking
variable, the exchange rate.

Let us consider a two—country world. The world econorw is characterized by
an n—dimensional vector of state variables, x and the domestic currency price

of the foreign currency is e. In each country the authorities seek to maximize

We define as the time consistent solution the

stationary solution to which this system converges for t = 0 as T goes to

infinity. We do not know of any general result concerning the convergence of
this process. However in our empirical applications we have not run into major
problems. Cohen and Michel (1981*) show that in a one dimensional case this kind
of a recursion does have a fix—point.

The Open—Loop Solution
The open—loop solution corresponds to a one—shot game where the authorities

announce at time zero the whole path of their policies. It thus does not by
definition require the use of a backward recursion procedure. The set of
dynamic equations formed by the state variable difference equations and the
first—order conditions corresponding to the optimal control problem of the

authorities could for example be solved explicitly by using the method proposed
in Blanchard and Kahn (1980) or numerically with a nnltiple shooting algorithm
(see Lipton, Poterba, Sachs and Summers (1982)). However, we shall present here
a backward recursion procedure which leads to a simple algorithm.

The optimal control problem faced by the authorities of country i leads to
the definition of the Hamiltonian H

announcing a proper path of future policies. Its shadow cost in the first

is thus a predetermined variable equal to zero in the

first period and has to be added to the vector of state variables, x, when the

The open—loop solution is the stationary limit to which this recursion
converges. It should be noted that here the policy rule is not only a function
of the state variables,

but also of the costate variables

Let us give a simple example in the case where each country has a single

policy instrument. The policy rule is

The policy rule appears to be of a more complicated form than the time

consistent rule. it is a function not only of the current state variables but
of the lagged values of these state variables and of the lagged moves.

The Buiter Solution
Buiter (1933) proposes a solution to the time inconsistency problem which

we discuss in the paper. Formally his strate' amounts to setting p equal to
zero and suppressing equations (A37).

The Optimal Linear Rule

The problem here is to derive the optimal linear rule, i.e. the constant
feedback

rule which yields the higher welfare for the authorities of each

country. It can be divided into two steps. The first step consists in
obtaining

the value of the welfare for each country, w1(r) and w2(r). Then, in

a second step, the optimal values of

and r2 are calculated using a numerical

gradient nethod. We shall not discuss here the second step for which we refer
the reader to Roth (1979). The first step is again solved by backward recursion
which proved nore tractable for the repeated calculations imposed by the
gradient nethod.

unity. More precisely:
