Dynamics of the Gender Gap in High Math Achievement

NBER Working Paper No. 24910
August 2018
JEL No. I20,J16
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the dynamics of the gender gap in high math achievement over the high
school years using data from the American Mathematics Competition. A clear gender gap is
already present by 9th grade and the gender gap widens over the high school years. Highachieving students must substantially improve their performance from year to year to maintain
their within-cohort rank, but there is nonetheless a great deal of persistence in the rankings.
Several gender-related differences in the dynamics contribute to the widening of the gender gap,
including differences in dropout rates and in the mean and variance of year-to-year improvements
among continuing students. A decomposition indicates that the most important difference is that
fewer girls make large enough gains to move up substantially in the rankings. An analysis of
students on the margin of qualifying for a prestigious second stage exam provides evidence of a
discouragement effect: some react to falling just short by dropping out of participating in future
years, and this reaction is more common among girls.

Introduction

The gender gap in average science and math achievement by the end of high school has
narrowed significantly in recent decades and is qualitatively small today (Xie and Shauman
2003; Goldin et al. 2006; Hyde et al. 2008; Guiso et al. 2008). However, girls are underrepresented among high-achieving students in middle and high school (Hedges and Nowell 1995;
Ellison and Swanson 2010) and in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
workforce (Ginther and Kahn 2004; Carrell et al. 2010). These gaps have been shown to
vary with potentially manipulable environmental factors such as local culture (Pope and
Sydnor 2010) and availability of same-gender instructors (Carrell et al. 2010). To the extent
that there is a role for policy in addressing female underrepresentation in STEM, several
natural questions arise: at what point in students’ development do these gaps occur, how
do they evolve over time, and why?1
This paper examines the gender gap among high-achieving math students from a dynamic perspective using data from the American Mathematics Competitions. We document
that girls are underrepresented among high-achieving math students at the beginning of
high school, and this gender gap widens significantly over the high school years. We then examine gender-related differences in students’ entry into test-taking, exit out of test-taking,
and year-to-year improvement in scores in order to better understand the growth of the
gender gap.
Section 2 provides more detail on the AMC contests, some summary statistics, and
presents our two most basic observations about the gender gap that motivate the rest of
the paper. One is that that there is already a substantial gender gap among high-achieving
9th graders. The second is that the gender gap widens substantially over the high school
years. For example, we find a 4.6:1 male-female ratio among the 500 highest scoring 9th
graders on the AMC contests. This widens to a 7.4:1 ratio among the 500 highest scoring
12th graders. The first observation motivates examining the individual-level persistence in
high scores: if it is substantial (which we will find), then future work on pre-high school
high achievement will be needed to understand the 9th grade gap, which is in turn a large
contributor to the end of high school gender gap. The second observation motivates a richer
examination of the dynamics of achievement among high-achieving high school students and
the gender-related differences that combine to produce the widening gap. Many potential
explanations have been discussed to account for the single fact that boys outnumber girls
1

As discussed in Fryer and Levitt (2010), boys and girls perform equally well upon entry to school, but
over the first six years of school, girls lose more than two-tenths of a standard deviation.

1

among high math achievers. A fuller understanding of the dynamics will provide a much
larger set of facts that any proposed explanation (or set of explanations) for why there is a
large gender gap at the end of high school would need to explain.
Section 3 takes a step back from the focus on gender to provide some initial observations
on the dynamics of high achievement in high school. We present both raw transition
matrices and regression analyses looking at how students at a given performance level
in year t will perform in year t + 1. We also examine the rates at which high-achieving
students appear to drop out of participation in the following year, and the rates at which new
“entrants” start participating and perform well. We present many more facts than should be
summarized in an introduction. One important observation is that high-achieving students
are substantially improving their mastery of the precalculus mathematics and problem
solving skills tested by the AMC contests over the high school years. The magnitude of the
average increases and the fact that there are many more lower-ranked students looking to
move up than students close to the top implies that high-achieving students must improve
substantially to maintain their position and the probability of making substantial gains
relative to one’s cohort is low. Improvement presumably requires substantial effort – indeed,
many of the very best performers come from schools with advanced math curricula and
coaching outside regular school hours (Ellison and Swanson 2016). Finally, these results
indicate that a rough answer to our first motivating question is that there is a lot of
performance persistence.
Section 4 then explores gender-related differences in the dynamics to identify factors
that lead to the widening gender gap. Studies of other environments have identified several
gender-related differences that could affect patterns of entry, exit, and improvement on the
AMC tests. Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), for example, show in a laboratory experiment
in which men and women have equal ability that men are more likely than women to opt
for tournament-based compensation, which suggests that gender differences in preferences
over competition could affect entry.2 Women have also been found to have higher exit rates
in competitive settings – Hogarth et al. (2012) study gender differences in a TV game show
testing general knowledge, and show that women earn 40 percent less than men and exit the
game prematurely at a faster rate. Finally, as noted above, high achievement in the AMC
2
These differences in preferences have real-world implications – Buser et al. (2014) analyze data on Dutch
high schoolers and find that, although boys and girls display similar levels of academic ability, boys choose
substantially more prestigious math- and science-intensive academic tracks, and that the gender difference in
competitiveness accounts for a substantial portion (about 20 percent) of the gender difference in track choice.
In a related finding, Azmat et al. (2016) show that gender differentials in the performance of Barcelona high
school students on standardized tests depends on the stakes of the tests for university entry.

2

requires a substantial ongoing investment of time and effort. Conditional on continuing to
participate in the AMC, girls and boys may allocate their time or effort differently across
extracurricular activities over the course of high school (see, e.g., Chachra et al. (2009)). Our
analyses indeed uncover several distinct differences by gender. High-achieving girls improve
by less on average from year to year than do boys with similar performance levels in the
initial year. The variance of the girls’ improvements is lower. Girls at each performance
level are more likely to drop out of participating. And girls are underrepresented among
the high-scoring entrants. We propose a method for decomposing the net change in the
fraction female among high scoring students into several components reflecting different
gender-related differences in these dynamics. The decomposition suggests that the most
important gender-related difference is that fewer girls are making large enough increases
from year to year to move up into the top rank groups. But the widening gender gap is
clearly a multifaceted phenomenon with several contributing factors.
Section 5 has a somewhat different flavor. Here, we venture into the realm of assessing potential explanations for the gender gap in looking at whether a portion of the gap
may be attributable to gender-related differences in students’ reactions to disappointment.
Specifically, we note that the structure of the AMC contests is such that high-achieving
students will be quite disappointed if they fall short of a threshold score needed to move
on to a second stage exam, and that this disappointment can be viewed as a treatment
that is applied at a different cutoff level of performance on different tests. Prior evidence
has demonstrated that men and women react differently to losing contests: in the lab, Gill
and Prowse (2014) find that women who lose a contest score lower in subsequent contests;
Buser (2016) finds that men (but not women) react to losing by seeking greater challenges;
and Buser and Yuan (2018) find that, even within populations who have already opted into
competing, women are more likely to react to losing by ceasing to compete. Buser and
Yuan (2018) also present field evidence on a setting very similar to our own using data
from the Dutch Math Olympiad; using a regression discontinuity design, they estimate
that girls failing to advance in competition in a given year are about 11 percentage points
more likely to drop out of participating in the next year, with no statistically significant
effect of losing on boys’ participation. In our setting, we also argue that a variant of a
regression-discontinuity design is appropriate for analyzing students’ reactions, and with a
great deal of precision. Our large sample (approximately 100 times as many student-years
as that available in Buser and Yuan (2018)) allows us to examine a narrow window around
the cutoff for progressing to the second stage exam, and we find strong evidence that both

3

boys and girls are more likely to drop out of participating in future years if they score just
below the cutoff, and that the tendency to drop out after experiencing disappointment is
more common among girls.3 Thus, we confirm Buser and Yuan (2018)’s finding that girls
are more likely to react by dropping out, but document that the effect among boys is also
large and that the differential effect for girls in the United States contest is not as extreme
as they find in the Netherlands.
The final Section provides a more complete recap of results and presents conclusions
and implications for future research.
Our investigation in related to a number of literatures in addition to those mentioned
above. Most notably, it is motivated in several respects by the rich literature on gender gaps
in wages and career development. As summarized in Blau and Kahn (2017), gender gaps in
mathematics and career-oriented college majors declined substantially between the 1960s
and 1980s, but there has been less progress since.4 This is notable, as gender differences in
college major are an important determinant of the pay gap between college-educated men
and women. The literature also contains analyses of the dynamics of the gender gap in pay
with interesting observations. Goldin et al. (2017) examine the 34 log point expansion in
the gender earnings gap between ages 26 and 39, and attribute half of the gap widening
for college graduates to differential mobility between establishments by gender. Bertrand
et al. (2010) document that male and female MBAs have nearly identical earnings at the
outset of their careers, but the male earnings advantage reaches almost 60 log points a
decade later, due in large part to gender differences in the effects of parenthood on career
interruptions and weekly hours. This literature highlights that differences in mathematics
achievement may have significant economic implications. The fact that the broadening gaps
identified in these papers do not start at zero also motivates looking back at an earlier point
in students’ lives. And while some factors like motherhood that these papers identify will
not be relevant to our setting, the interesting dynamics these papers uncover suggest more
generally that other examinations of dynamics may also be fruitful.
3

Buser and Yuan (2018) find that boys are roughly 1 percentage point more likely to drop out after
failing to advance, vs. 11 percentage points among girls. Their standard errors are about 6 percentage
points, implying that it is unclear whether there is an effect for boys and the effect for girls is quite large
but only borderline significant. We find estimates of 3 percentage points for boys (a 9 percent effect, relative
to dropout rates among boys scoring just above the cutoff) and 5 percentage points for girls (a 15 percent
effect), with standard errors below 1 percentage point.
4
Focusing on STEM fields specifically, Ceci et al. (2014) present evidence on lower female propensities to
major in math-intensive subjects in college and higher female propensities to major in non-math-intensive
sciences. They then examine career development in STEM fields and find greater evidence of pipeline leakage
in fields such as psychology, life science, and social science, rather than in math-intensive fields in which
they are more underrepresented.

2

The High-Achievement Gender Gap in AMC Scores

In this Section, we bring out some basic facts about the gender gap among AMC high
scorers. In Ellison and Swanson (2010), we noted that there was a large gender gap at
high achievement levels and that the gaps get larger as one looks at achievement levels
further above those that can be reliably measured with more commonly used standardized
tests. Among the new observations we make here is that the high-achievement gender gap
is already quite large by the time students are in 9th grade and that it continues to widen
over the course of the high school years.

2.1

Background and data

The primary subject of our analysis is a database of scores on the Mathematical Association
of America’s AMC 10 and AMC 12 contests from 1999 to 2007. The tests are 25-question,
multiple choice tests designed to identify and distinguish among students at very high
performance levels. They are administered to over 200,000 students in about 3,000 U.S.
high schools. The AMC 10 is open to students in grades 10 and below. The AMC 12 is
open to students in grade 12 and below.
Several features of the AMC exams make them well suited to studying the development
of high math achievement over the high school years. One is that the tests are designed to
asses a broad range of (high) performance levels and are reliable even for very high-achieving
students.5 Another is that many of the high-achieving students in our sample take the tests
annually over a four year period, which lets us track the year-to-year improvement in their
absolute achievement levels.
The structure of the AMC contests changed twice in the period we study. In 1999, all
students took a common test similar to the AMC 12. In 2000, the AMC introduced the
AMC 10 and began offering younger students the option of taking either test. The AMC 10
and 12 are similar – 14 of the 25 questions were common to both tests in the first year – but
to be less intimidating to younger students and less affected by knowledge of above gradelevel material, the AMC 10 avoids logarithms and trigonometry, and rarely has questions
as difficult as the five most difficult on the AMC 12. In 2002, the AMC began offering four
tests per year: the AMC 10A and 12A were offered on one date in early February, and
the AMC 10B and 12B were offered two weeks later. One motivation was to accommodate
5
Ellison and Swanson (2010) note that AMC scores are a stronger predictor of how students will do when
retaking the math SAT than is the previous math SAT score and the tests remain a calibrated predictor
of future test scores at upper tail percentiles that are an order of magnitude higher than can be measured
with the SAT.

5

students whose school was on vacation or cancelled due to snow on the A-date. But schools
could offer both the A-date and B-date tests and some students choose to take a test on
each date. In 2007, about 3 percent of A-date takers also took a B-date test.
The test multiplicity necessitates rescaling scores from the various year-t tests to make
them comparable to other tests from the same year. In the years 2000-2006, the way in
which we do this is to think of year-t scores as predictors of year-t + 1 AMC 12 scores.
Focusing on students who participate in both year t and year t + 1, we run separate linear
regressions of year-t + 1 AMC 12 scores on scores on each year-t test and consider two
year-t scores to be equivalent if the predicted year-t + 1 AMC 12 score is the same. This
year-ahead prediction is not possible in the final year of our data, so in 2007 we instead
normalize scores by comparing the performance of students who take both an A test and
a B test in 2007. Appendix A provides more details on the methodology and the resulting
normalizations. An AMC 10 score of x turns out to be roughly equivalent to a score of 78 x
on the AMC 12, but there are idiosyncratic differences from test to test of about 5 to 10
points on the AMC 12’s 150 point scale. There is more top-coding of AMC 10 scores than
AMC 12 scores, but top-coding is still at least an order of magnitude less common than on
more commonly studied standardized tests.6
The normalization described above is not designed to put year-t and year-t0 scores on a
common scale. Instead, we mostly avoid the difficulties inherent in comparing scores across
calendar years by focusing on students’ ranks within the set of students who participate in
a given year. In Section 3.1 we present data which suggests that transforming scores to log
ranks is a very natural way to normalize student performance in that it produces a measure
in which the additive improvement in performance from year to year is similar over a wide
range of (high) initial performance levels. We see the ability to renormalize scores in this
way as another attractive feature of the AMC environment.
Our raw data consists of separate files of student-level scores on each test in each year.
In addition to the scores, the records contain a school identifier, the state in which the
school is located, an anonymization of the student’s name, and the student’s gender, grade,
age, and home zip code. We create a student-level panel data set by merging these files
assuming that two scores belong to the same student if the name and school match and the
age, grade, and gender are consistent, or if the name and state are the same and the city,
6

A perfect 150 on the AMC 10 is usually equivalent to about a 130 on the AMC 12. A few hundred
students per year score at least 130 on the AMC 12 versus about 15,000 who get perfect scores on the math
SAT.

6

ZIP code, age, grade, and gender are consistent.7
In the full pre-2007 dataset, we match 43 percent of 9th to 11th grade students to a
score in the subsequent year. Note that failures to match result both from students who
do not participate in the following year and the limitations of our procedure; e.g., we will
miss students who report their name differently in different years, students who skip a
grade, most students who move, etc. One would expect high-achieving students to be more
likely to take the AMC in subsequent years, and our match rates are consistent with this.
For example, among 9th to 11th grade students who were among the 500 highest scoring
students in their cohort, the subsequent-year match rate is 80 percent.
In our analyses of the evolution of students’ scores over time, we define a student’s
AdjustedScore in year t to be the rescaling of the score that they received on the first test
offered by their school. Note that, at schools that offer both the A-date and B-date tests,
students who only take the B-date test in year t are coded as not participating in that
year. The primary reason for this decision is that we think doing otherwise would lead to
substantial miscounts of high-scoring students.8

2.2

Summary statistics and the gender gap in AMC participation

Table 1 provides some summary statistics on participation and scores by grade and gender.
For each grade-gender pair, it reports an equally weighted average across the nine years
1999-2007 of several summary statistics for that grade and gender. For example, the 18,984
9th grade girls listed as participating indicate that this is the average number of 9th grade
girls who participate in each of the nine years of our dataset. The top panel contains
information for female students. Female participation grows substantially from 9th to 10th
grade, from an average of about 19,000 9th grade girls per year to about 28,000 10th grade
girls per year. One reason for this growth may be that some teachers may hesitate to
recommend the AMC tests to 9th graders, regarding the tests as too advanced and/or too
likely to be a discouraging experience. Awareness of the AMCs also presumably diffuses
over time. Female participation remains roughly constant from 10th to 11th grade. It then
7

Only unique matches are kept in the dataset for analysis. Students’ demographic variables are missing
for 3-6 percent of observations; we consider two values of a variable to be “consistent” if they match or
if one or more values is missing. Grade is considered a match between a year-t observation and a year-t0
observation if gradet − gradet0 = t − t0 .
8
Miscounting is a concern because most schools offer only the A-date tests and some of the most serious
students at such schools try to take a B-date test at some other area school that does offer it. Our procedure
avoids double-counting these students if the alternate location they find is a school offering the test on both
dates, which we think is by far the most common situation in which this occurs.

7

drops by about 18 percent from 11th to 12th grade.9 One reason for this decline may be
that 12th grade scores and awards come out too late to be listed on college applications.
The bottom portion of the Table reports comparable statistics for boys. Male participation is about 11 percent higher than female participation in 9th grade. Its growth from
9th grade to 10th grade is similar to what we saw for girls. The series then diverge a
bit more, as male participation continues to grow from 10th grade to 11th grade, and has
an 11th-to-12th grade decline that is less than half as large as the decline for females in
percentage terms. At the end of high school about 35 percent more 12th grade boys than
12th grade girls are taking the AMC 12.

Table 1: Average annual AMC participation and scores by gender and grade level
The Table also provides summary statistics on normalized AMC scores in each gradegender cell. The overall mean adjusted score is 66 on the AMC 12’s 0 to 150 scale. We
will not discuss population average scores much because the AMC tests are not a good
source for insights on average performance given the highly-selected populations, but it is
true that the means and variances are higher in each grade in the male population. We
will say a lot about year-to-year improvement for the average AMC participant, but defer
these discussions until later Sections analyzing the student-level data. Our previous papers
focused on counts of students achieving scores above higher thresholds, for which we think
selection is less of an issue. Scoring 100 on the AMC 12 can be thought of as roughly similar
in difficulty to scoring 780 or 800 on the math SAT. Among 12th graders scoring at this
level or higher, we find a male-female ratio of about 3.4:1. The male-female ratio among
9

We have constructed the sample to include 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders from all years, so the drop
in female participation noted here should not be contaminated by the time-trend in AMC participation.

8

students achieving comparable scores on the SATs is about 2:1. The gender gap could be
somewhat different on the AMC and SAT due to differences in what is being tested, but
the magnitude of the difference does suggest that there are some gender-related differences
in participation rates even among high-achieving 12th graders. Scoring 120 on the AMC 12
represents a much higher level of achievement – roughly in the 99.99th percentile in the full
US 12th grade population. Here, we think that selection into test-taking is less important.
Note that the male-to-female ratio is much larger among students reaching the higher score
level on the AMC. This is part of a larger pattern noted in Ellison and Swanson (2010).
One implication is that one needs to be careful in constructing comparisons; e.g., we would
expect the male-to-female ratio among 9th graders scoring at least 100 to be larger than the
male-to-female ratio among 12th graders scoring at least 100, because looking at students
scoring 100 in 9th grade is looking at students who are much farther out into the right tail.

2.3

The gender gap in high math achievement over the high school years

In this Section, we illustrate how the gender gap among AMC high scorers changes over
the course of high school. In Ellison and Swanson (2010), we noted that there was a large
gender gap among AMC high scorers and that it was larger at higher achievement levels.
Among the additional observations here are that the gender gap is already quite large in
9th grade and that it widens substantially over the course of high school.
Table 2 reports the fraction of AMC high scorers in each grade who are female for various
definitions of high scoring. The first row examines the 5,000 highest-scoring students in
each grade-year. These are very high-achieving students, but not extremely unusual ones:
one could think of them as students on a trajectory to score 780 or 800 on the math SAT by
the end of high school. In the upper left cell, we see that there is a substantial gender gap
in 9th grade: only 30.5 percent of the high-scoring 9th graders are female.10 Comparing
from left-to-right across the columns, we see that the gender gap widens in each subsequent
year. By 12th grade, only 21.8 percent of the high-scorers are female. The drop from 9th
grade to 10th grade is the largest, but the decline is fairly steady over the high school years.
Subsequent rows present comparable figures using more and more demanding definitions
of high-achieving, going all the way out to a definition that allows only the top 1 percent
of our initial high-achieving pool. Looking from left-to-right within each row, we see the
finding that the gender gap widens over the course of high school is quite robust to how
one defines high-scoring. In proportional terms, the decline in the fraction female from
10

The figure reports the average across the six cohorts that we observe for all four of their high school
years of the fraction female within each cohort.

Table 2: Percent female by grade and achievement level
9th grade to 12th is between 19 percent and 35 percent in every row. The proportional
decline over the course of high school appears largest when we use the top 500 definition
and smallest when we use the top 50 definition, but it should be kept in mind that the
estimates in the final row will be quite noisy given the small sample sizes.
Ellison and Swanson (2010) highlighted that the gender gap is much larger when one
examines more extreme high achievers. The first column of Table 2 shows clearly that this
pattern is already present by 9th grade. Girls comprise 30.5 percent of the top 5000 9th
graders, but only 8.4 percent of the top 50 9th graders. Indeed, the decline from the top row
to the bottom row is roughly similar in each column. One implication is that it is important
to understand the persistence of performance over the high school years. If performance is
highly persistent (which we will find), then the Ellison and Swanson (2010) finding about
how the gender gap differs for extreme high achievers relative to ordinary high achievers
cannot be primarily a finding about things that are happening in high school. What is
clearly an issue that must be understood by studying the high school years, however, is
that the gender gap is widening among ordinary high achievers, extreme high achievers,
and everyone in between. Our subsequent analyses are motivated in large part by a desire
to better understand this widening of the gender gap.

Dynamics of Achievement Among High Achievers

In this Section, we take a step back from gender-related issues and present some more general evidence on the dynamics of achievement among high-achieving math students. Among
our observations are that the distribution of mathematical achievement is sufficiently spread
out so that the top 9th graders are already very high up in the overall score distribution,
that high-achieving students must substantially improve their performance from year to
year to keep up with their cohort, and that there is substantial performance persistence:

the highest scoring students are much more likely to achieve a very high score in the following year than students ranked just a little lower, and it is unlikely that students will
greatly improve their within-cohort rank.

3.1

Growth and variation in absolute performance

Although it is becoming increasingly common to take calculus in the junior year and the
AMC contests only cover precalculus topics, top students are increasing their command of
the AMC material and problem-solving techniques over the course of high school.11 To give
some sense of how performance grows over time, Table 3 lists the average overall rank that
a student needed to have in order to be in the grade-specific top 50, top 100, top 500, etc.
For example, to rank among the top 100 9th graders, one only needs to score in the top
1,173 overall, whereas a 12th grader needs to score in the top 241 overall to be in the top
100 in his or her cohort.

Table 3: Growth in absolute performance: the full-population rank of the N th best student
in each grade
One immediate observation from the Table is that some students have already reached
very high achievement levels by 9th grade. For example, the 500th best 9th grader is
already well within the top 5000 12th graders, and hence is already at the level where we
would expect a nearly perfect SAT score. The 50th best 9th grader is similarly well within
the top 500 12th graders.
While some 9th graders are already very good, the Table also makes very clear that
students must improve substantially from year to year if they wish to maintain their withincohort position. The right panel reports the percentage reduction in the overall rank that
students in various positions must make to maintain their within-grade rank. High scoring
11

In 2015, over 120,000 AP Calculus exams were taken by students in 11th grade and below. It was less
common for the cohorts we study, but there were already over 30,000 students in 11th grade or below taking
AP Calculus when our first cohort was in 11th grade (2001).

11

9th graders will need to improve their overall rank by roughly 40-60 percent in order to
achieve the same position relative to their peers as a 10th grader. High scoring 10th graders
will need to improve their overall rank by about 50 percent. The required improvement
between 11th and 12th grades is somewhat smaller. But we think of the 20-30 percent
improvement required as still surprisingly large, given that the 12th grade competitor pool
is smaller and most high scoring 12th graders will be studying calculus (or something more
advanced), which is not covered on the AMC tests.
The similarity of the percentage change numbers within each column is striking given
that the stringency of the definition of high achievement varies by two orders of magnitude
from the top to the bottom. We take this as suggesting that the log of a student’s rank is
a natural cardinal measure of performance to use when analyzing high-achieving students.
We see this as another feature of the AMC environment which makes it attractive to study.12
One simple way to get a feel for what size of year-to-year improvement is typical at
the individual level is to examine the distribution of log(Rankt+1 ) − log(Rankt ) among
students who take the test in both years t and t + 1. This variable has a mean of -0.28
for 9th graders, -0.39 for 10th graders, and -0.26 for 11th graders. These are substantial
increases in performance. For example, a student who scores at the 50th percentile of the
AMC-taking population as a 9th grader and improves his or her log rank by the expected
amount in each year would reach the 62nd percentile in 10th grade, the 75th percentile in
11th grade, and the 80th percentile in 12th grade. However, note also that they are not
nearly enough to bring the already strong 9th grader in the example up to the top of the
distribution by the end of 12th grade. We think of this as another way in which AMC
scores suggest that the distribution of mathematical performance is quite spread out even
among students that are normally lumped together as high achievers.
One would expect that the degree to which students improve from year to year will
differ for students in different parts of the distribution. The effort that students are putting
into improving their knowledge and problem solving skills will differ. And although the
right panel of Table 3 suggests that a log-rank transformation of performance is natural,
any cardinalization of mathematical achievement is inherently arbitrary. Because AMC
performance in any given year is a noisy measure of a student’s underlying achievement
level, one cannot estimate average achievement gains as a function of initial achievement
12

When student performance can only be measured as a within-year z-score, the dynamics of the yearto-year changes in relative-to-cohort performance are more difficult to analyze for high-scoring students
because changes are highly asymmetric: high-achieving students can only improve their performance very
slightly from year to year, but can easily do much worse.

12

via an OLS regression. We can, however, use IV regressions to estimate such gains when
some instrument for the measurement error is available. The columns of Table 4 present
regressions of log(Rankt+1 )−log(Rankt ) on −(log(W ithinGradeRankt )−log(5000)), using
the log of a student’s within-grade rank in year-t − 1 as an instrument on the subsample
where this variable is available. The constant terms in these regressions can be thought of
as the average improvement for a student who has the 5000th best score in their cohort
in year t. The estimates suggest that these improvements in log rank are -0.50 for 10th
graders and -0.33 for 11th graders. If we convert the mean improvements in Rank needed
to maintain a given within-grade rank in Table 3 to changes in log(Rank), they would
be approximately -0.74 in 10th grade and -0.32 in 11th grade. Hence, a 10th grader who
ranks 5000th in his grade must improve by substantially more than the expected amount
in order to maintain his or her rank. Intuitively, this reflects that there are many more
students ranked below the 5000th student than above. If the 5000th ranked student makes
the average improvement, then there will be more students jumping ahead of her due to
above-average gains than falling behind due to below-average gains.

Table 4: IV regressions of growth in absolute performance as a function of initial performance relative to cohort
The negative coefficient estimates on the term reflecting initial achievement levels indicates that students at higher achievement levels in the initial year are expected to make
even larger improvements in log rank. For example, the predicted improvements for a student who ranks 500th in his or her cohort in year t are -0.66 for a 10th grader and -0.45 for
an 11th grader. The former is very close to what is needed for a 10th grader to maintain
the same rank; the latter is more than sufficient for an 11th grader.
Standard deviations of the full sample increases in log rank are 0.73, 0.86, and 0.96
for 9th to 10th, 10th to 11th, and 11th to 12th grades, respectively. Note that these
will reflect both the measurement error of the test as a measure of students’ underlying

13

achievement levels in both years, and also true variation in the growth in achievement from
year to year. A comparison of performance changes over multiple years can give some
insight on the relative magnitudes of measurement error and true performance increases.
Suppose that year-t performance yit = ait + it reflects both student i’s true ability ait and
an additive mean-zero measurement error it . Suppose that ability evolves according to
ait+1 = α0 + α1 ait + uit+1 . And suppose that the measurement errors it are independent
of all other terms. We then have
Var(yit+1 − α1 yit ) = Var(it+1 ) + α12 Var(it ) + Var(uit )
Cov(yit+1 − α1 yit , yit − α1 yit−1 )) = −α1 Var(it ) + Cov(uit+1 , uit )
One would assume that the true improvements uit are positively correlated, as some students
are presumably working harder on improving than others. Hence, one could think of the
covariance term as providing a lower bound on the measurement error variance:
Var(it ) ≥ −

1
Cov(yit+1 − α1 yit , yit − α1 yit−1 ),
α1

that would be close to the true value if Cov(uit+1 , uit ) is small. If we use log(Rankit ) as
the performance measure yit , estimate α1 via an IV regression of yit+1 on yit using yit−1
as an instrument run on the sample of students who took the AMC for three consecutive
years, and compute the above variances and covariances on the same sample, we get a lower
bound estimate of Var(it ) that corresponds to it having a standard deviation of 0.62. This
indicates that a substantial portion of the apparent year-to-year variation in scores is due
to the measurement error of the test as a measure of underlying achievement.
If we assume that this lower bound also applies to Var(it+1 ), we can also plug into the
formulas above to get an upper bound on the standard deviation of uit , which describes the
heterogeneity in students’ true improvement from year to year. Again, this should be close
to the true value if the covariance of year-to-year improvement is low. This estimate corresponds to uit having a standard deviation of 0.37, which suggests that there is substantial
heterogeneity in students’ true improvement from year to year, albeit not nearly as much
as naively looking at year-to-year changes in scores might suggest.

Persistence and mobility in relative-to-cohort performance

We now focus on how students move up and down within their cohort from year to year.
Table 5 presents an estimated rank-to-rank transition matrix. For example the element in

Table 5: Persistence in math performance: forward transition matrix of probability of each
year-t + 1 within-grade rank group for students in each year-t within-grade rank group
One clear observation from the Table is that performance in year t is a strikingly strong
predictor of performance in year t + 1, even when making comparisons that rely on fine
distinctions in year-t performance. Comparing students who were ranked in the top 50 in
their grade in year t to those ranked 51-100, for example, the higher-ranked students are
more than twice as likely to achieve a top 50 score in year t + 1 (36 percent vs. 16 percent),
and less than half as likely to score outside the top 500 (10 percent vs. 25 percent). Similar
patterns are visible over and over in the additional rows. Students who were ranked from
51-100 are more than twice as likely to achieve a top 100 score in year t+1 than are students
who were ranked 101-200 at t. Students ranked from 101-200 at t are more than twice as
likely to achieve a top 200 score at t + 1 than are students who ranked 201-500, and so on.
A second observation is that it is possible to move up in the distribution, but substantial
improvements are quite unlikely. Four group improvements are close to zero percent events
– the probability of moving from the 501-1000 group into the top 50 is estimated to be
slightly above 0.5 percent. However, making less sizable gains is also quite uncommon.
Only 6-16 percent of the student in each rank group make enough of an improvement to
move into a higher rank group in the next year. And only 2-6 percent make enough of an
improvement to move up two or more groups. Declines in within-cohort ranks are much
more common. For example, 53 percent of students ranked from 201-500 in year t will score
13

Due to the discreteness of AMC scores, there will typically be a number of students tied for positions
that cross each boundary. For example, in 2006, fourteen 11th graders had scores of 124, which left them
tied for positions 196 to 209. In this situation, we would include the experience of each of these students
with weight 0.64 in our calculation of what happened to students with ranks of 201 to 500 in year t. And
we similarly record each student’s outcome as their probability of being in each rank group as though ties
are broken at random.

15

outside the top 500 in year t + 1.
A third observation is that dropping out of participation is relevant even among highachieving students. In our full sample, we are unable to match 57 percent of grade 9-11
year-t participants to a year-t + 1 score. Among students who are ranked from 1001-5000
in their grade in year t, the percent unmatched drops to 35 percent. But the fact that the
unmatched rate is 35 percent for students with ranks from 1001-5000 and just 14 percent
for students with ranks from 1-50 suggests that at least 20 percent of the students in the
1001-5000 truly do not participate in year t. Dropping out appears to be less and less likely
as one moves up in the ranks. The majority of the unmatched students in the top group
are probably unmatched because of the limitations of our dataset rather than due to the
students actually dropping out.14
One final comment on the Table is that we feel it bolsters the case that the AMC is
an interesting measurement tool. While we always encourage readers to look up old test
questions online, with the belief that many will feel that the test seems nicely designed to
test both problem solving skills and students’ command of core precalculus topics, such
impressions cannot tell us how noisy a test is as a measure of some student capability, nor
how much we should care about the capability being measured. In the case of the AMC,
the level of persistence in Table 5 makes very clear that the test is a sufficiently accurate
and consistent measure of some capability related to high achievement such that it is a
good predictor of year-ahead performance. And our earlier results on students’ gains from
year to year indicate that the capability being measured is something that builds over the
high school years, versus something more stable like differential quickness or accuracy in
performing calculations.
We also present here a longer horizon backward-looking transition matrix. Table 6
reports in each column the fraction of students who achieved the rank corresponding to
14

To investigate this issue, we looked manually through published lists of 2006 and 2007 high scorers.
Among the top 50 students in each grade in 2006, we failed to find 2007 matches for 2.6 percent of 9th
graders, 4.3 percent of 10th graders, and 12.1 percent of 11th graders. These figures should be compared
to the sum of the dropout rate and the probability of finishing outside the 2000 in our mechanical match,
which is about 18 percent on average across grades. Several factors are involved in the superiority of this
manual match over our mechanical match: manually, we were able to identify students who switched schools,
students who took the test at a testing center in one year and in their high school in another year, and
students who appear to have listed their first name differently in different years. While the 12 percent
dropout rate after 11th grade may seem surprising, it includes at least one extremely strong student who
left high school after 11th grade to start college, as well as several 11th-to-12th grade dropouts whose 2006
AMC scores were surprisingly high given their previous 2005 AMC scores and their subsequent 2006 AIME
scores. It is worth noting that matching failures are likely more prevalent at the highest score levels due
to high-performing students taking the exams at testing centers in lieu of or in addition to their own high
schools.

16

that column in 12th grade who were in each rank category in 9th grade. Note that the
numbers in each column now sum to one. At the very highest levels of achievement, the
performance persistence we noted earlier remains striking. There are more holdovers from
the 9th-grade top 50 in the 12th-grade top 50 than there are students who have moved
up from the entire 201-40,000 range. Only 5 percent scored outside the top 1000 as 9th
graders. Although there are a substantial fraction, 35 percent, whom we were unable to
match to a 9th grade score, given how few students manage to move up from the 1000+
range into the top 50, we imagine that many of these students are students whom we failed
to match rather than true entrants. Some causes of matching failures, including students
who switch high schools or skip grades, will likely be more severe when we are matching
across a three year span.

Table 6: Early performance of top math students: backward transition matrix of probability
of each within-9th-grade rank group for students in each within-12th-grade rank group
At the still extremely high level of students who rank 201-500 among 12th graders,
there is more heterogeneity in 9th grade origins. Students moving down from the top 200,
holdovers from the 9th grade 201-500 group, and students moving up from the 501-1000
group each comprise about 10 percent of this group. We also see a much larger number of
students who had not done as well in 9th grade, with 18 percent coming from the 1001-5000
range and 7 percent from the above 5000 range.
At the lower (but still high) levels of 12th grade achievement in the Table, improvement
since 9th grade plays an even more prominent role. Only about 5-9 percent of these students
in the 12th-grade 501-1000 and 1001-5000 rank groups are students who have dropped down
from a higher 9th grade rank group. Meanwhile, 12 percent and 19 percent, respectively,

17

are students who have moved into these groups after having scores that placed them outside
the top 5000 9th graders. These students have improved by enough to overcome both their
initial disadvantage and the substantially higher score needed to make the within-grade top
5000 as a 12th grader. The fraction of students that we cannot match to a 9th grade score
is also much larger in these groups at 53 percent and 62 percent, respectively. The fact
that the failure-to-match rate is so much larger here than it was for the top 50 students
suggests that a substantial number of the unmatched 12th graders in these groups are true
entrants who had not participated in 9th grade.
Early in this Section, we noted that the gender gap among high-achieving math students
is already large in 9th grade. Given that performance is highly persistent, it is not surprising that the girls are not able to overcome their initial disadvantage. But performance
persistence makes it all the more striking that the gender gap among high-achieving math
students actually widens substantially over the the high school years. Some of the more detailed findings in this Section highlight channels that could be relevant: large performance
improvements are needed to maintain one’s within-cohort rank; some students are dropping
out of participating (at least at all but the highest ranks); and the three-year time span
between 9th and 12th grades is long enough to allow quite a number of students who were
not high-performers in 9th grade to improve or enter and achieve a high rank by the end of
high school. Gender-related differences in any of these dimensions could contribute to the
widening gender gap that we document.

4

Gender Differences in Dynamics and a Decomposition

In this Section, we look at gender-related differences in the dynamics of year-to-year performance and present a decomposition that lets us quantify the relative importance of several
factors to the broadening of the gender gap in high math achievement over the high school
years.

4.1

Differences in dynamics

A number of gender-related differences could in principle lead to a widening gap: girls
might be more likely to drop out of participating; participating girls might improve less on
average from year to year; there may be less variance in year-to-year improvement for girls;
and/or fewer high-achieving girls may drop into participating.
We first look for gender-related differences in year-to-year improvement within the population of students who participate in the AMC tests in consecutive years. Table 7 presents
18

estimates from an OLS regression which has the change in each student’s within-grade rank
as the dependent variable. The left panel reports estimates from a regression run on the
set of students who ranked in the top 5000 within their grade in the initial year.15 The
negative coefficient on the initial rank indicates substantial mean-reversion in within-grade
rank, as one would expect given that test scores are a noisy measure of underlying ability.
A primary coefficient of interest in the regression is the coefficient on the Female dummy.
It is highly significant and indicates that girls are improving by less from year to year than
boys by about 30 log points. The second main estimate of interest is whether there are
gender-related differences in the variance of year-to-year improvement. The lower part of
the Table reports gender-specific means of the squared residuals from the above regression.
Again, we find a statistically significant gender difference: there is greater year-to-year
variance in the boys’ performances. Hence, we have identified two separate features of the
dynamics that would tend to contribute to a widening of the gender gap among the highest
achievers: (1) the girls’ mean improvement from year to year is lower; and (2) the variance
in their year-to-year improvement is also lower.

Table 7: Gender difference in within-cohort rank dynamics for high-achieving students
In the above regression, there is a moderately-sized but statistically significant coefficient
on the interaction between the Female dummy and within-grade rank, indicating that the
gender gap in mean improvement is larger for higher achievers. To examine whether this
15

The sample is restricted to the set of students who were in grades 9, 10, or 11 in the initial year and
whose genders were nonmissing. The regressions also include unreported year and grade dummies. The
log(GradeRankt ) control is adjusted by subtracting the sample mean.

19

may reflect a substantial difference among the highest achievers, the right panel of Table
7 estimates the same regression on the sample of even higher achievers who were ranked
in the top 500 in their cohort in the initial year. We find that things are not appreciably
different at this level. The gender gap in mean improvement is estimated to be 32 log points
per year. And the residual variance is again lower for the girls. As an additional robustness
test, we also estimated the above regressions separately on 9th, 10th, and 11th graders and
did not find substantial differences in either finding across grades.
Recall that we earlier noted that the fraction of year-t students whom we cannot match
to a year-t + 1 score is substantially higher for students lower down in the top 5000 than
for the highest scorers, which suggested that dropping out of test taking is relevant to the
composition of the set of high scorers. To look for gender-related differences in dropout
rates, we define an indicator Dropoutit for whether each year-t high scorer could not be
found in the year-t + 1 data, and regress this on the student’s within-grade rank in year t,
the square of this variable, a Female dummy, a Female × rank interaction, and grade, year
and B-date dummies.16
The first column of Table 8 reports estimates from a linear regression run on the full
sample of 9th-11th grade students who were in the top 5000 in their grade in year t. The
mean dropout rate in this sample is 32 percent, and dropout rates are similar across grades.
The primary coefficient of interest is the Female dummy. The estimate of 0.023 indicates
that girls are 2.3 percentage points more likely to drop out of participating than boys
with comparable scores. Again, the estimate is highly statistically significant, so we have
identified a third factor contributing to the widening of the gender gap over the course of
high school.
The second through fourth columns of the Table present similar regressions estimated
separately on the students in 9th, 10th, and 11th grades, respectively. Here, we do see
a substantial difference across grades. The gender gap in dropout rates is much larger in
the 11th to 12th grade transition than in the other years. We estimate that girls are 4.6
percentage points less likely to participate in 12th grade than boys who had comparable
11th grade scores. Early in high school, the gender gap in dropout rates is much smaller.
All regressions include controls for the student’s within-grade rank in the initial year.17
16
Dropoutit will reflect both true dropouts and students whom we fail to match due to inconsistently
reported names, etc. The B-test dummy takes on a value of 0.02 and is statistically significant. We suspect
that this reflects in part that a higher fraction of students taking B-date tests are students taking the test
at a location other than their regular school, which makes us more likely to fail to match their performances
across years. We hope that such matching failures are not gender-related.

Table 8: Gender difference in within-cohort rank dynamics for high-achieving students
The coefficients on these controls reflect that higher-scoring students are substantially less
likely to drop out. The coefficients are quite similar across all three grades, indicating that
this relationship is fairly stable over the course of high school.
The final column of Table 8 looks at more extreme high scorers who were among the
top 500 students in their grade in year t. The mean dropout rate in this sample is lower
at 19 percent, reflecting again that higher-scoring students are less likely to drop out in
year t + 1. The point estimate of the gender-related difference in dropout rates is also
much smaller, just 0.7 percentage points, but the standard error is such that we can neither
reject that the gender gap is zero, nor that it is the same as in the top 5000 sample. In
unreported grade by grade regressions, the gender gap in dropout rates again appears much
larger in 11th grade than in the earlier years, but the standard errors are such that the
only statistically significant conclusion one could draw about top 500 students is that that
there is a substantial gender gap in dropout rates after the 11th grade year.
We noted earlier that a nontrivial number of high scorers at the end of high school
are students whom we could not match to a 9th grade score. While some of this is due
to difficulties in matching, part is the real phenomenon of students participating in the
AMCs after not having been involved with math competitions from the outset. To examine
whether there are also gender-related differences in this aspect of the dynamics, Table 9 lists
the fraction female among all grade 9-11 students who were in each rank group in some year
from 1999-2006, and the fraction female among grade 10-12 students in the rank group in
in each grade, to facilitate interpretation of the coefficient of the Female dummy as reflecting the difference
in dropout rates for the mean student in our sample.

2000-2007 who are entrants; i.e., students who are in the rank group in year t + 1 and whom
we were unable to match to the year-t dataset.18 In all but the top rank group, we find that
the fraction of female students among the entrants is slightly lower than the fraction among
the students who were in that group in the previous year. On average the difference in the
percent female is about one percentage point. It is possible that there are gender-related
differences in our ability to match students; e.g., one gender could be more likely to fill
in their name differently in different years. However, girls are overrepresented in the pool
of year-t high scorers whom we cannot match to a year-t + 1 score, and underrepresented
among year-t + 1 high scorers whom we cannot match to a year-t score: the potential
gender-related matching errors suggested by these results have opposite sign. The lower
number of female students among students who achieve high scores after not having taken
the AMC in the previous year is a fourth contributor to the broadening of the gender gap
over the high school years.

Table 9: Gender composition of highly ranked students new to the AMC in comparison
with highly ranked students from the previous year
To recap, we have identified several gender-related differences in the dynamics of student
achievement that will contribute to the widening of the gender gap in high achievement on
the AMC over the high school years. High-achieving girls are on average not improving by
as much from year to year, there is less variance in their year-to-year improvement, they
are more likely to drop out of participating (especially after 11th grade), and we see fewer
girls among the high-scoring entrants whom we cannot find in the previous year’s data.

A decomposition of changes in the gender gap

In the previous Section, we noted that the dynamics of boys’ and girls’ achievement differ
in multiple ways. In this Section, we define a decomposition of the change in the gender gap
into portions attributable to various differences that provides a measure of their relative
importance.
Our analysis focuses on changes in the fraction µfXt of students in achievement group

X at time t who are female. (We will often use being in the top 50, 500, or 5000 as the
group X.) We relate this to various aspects of differences in the boys’ and girls’ transition
matrices. To define these, we write µfrt for the fraction female at rank r at time t. We
define arX as the fraction of students at rank r at time t who achieve a score in X at time
t + 1. We will define this both for numerical rank groups r ∈ X and for the set of students
who do not participate at time t + 1, which we denote by r = N P . Write afrX and afrN P for
the analogous objects for female students. Write Nrt and NX for the number of students
at rank r at time t and the number with ranks in the set X. Write µnew
Xt+1 for the fraction
of students in group X at time t + 1 who had not participated at time t and µf,new for the
Xt+1

fraction of students in group X at time t + 1 who are female and who had not participated
at t.

The first term in the decomposition, ∆drop
X , can be thought of as the change in female
representation that is due to girls dropping out at a different rate (assuming that the girls
who dropped out would have succeeded at the same rate as the girls who continued to
participate). The second term, ∆cont
X , reflects the difference in rates at which girls who continue to participate improve by enough to remain in rank group X. The third term, ∆grow
X ,
reflects the difference in rates at which lower-ranked girls versus boys subsequently climb
into group X. The fourth, ∆entry
, reflects any discrepancies between female representation
X
among the high scorers who did not participate in the previous year and what would be
19

23

expected given the total number of entrants and female representation among the previous
year’s high scorers.
The final term in the decomposition, ∆mech
, captures mechanical changes that would
X
occur even if there were no gender-related differences in the transition process, due to asymmetries in the initial conditions. There are mechanical effects pushing in both directions.
A negative effect is that the girls in each rank group X are disproportionately found in the
lower part of the rank group, so girls in X would be less likely to avoid dropping into a
lower group in the following year. Working in the opposite direction, there are also more
girls in the rank group just below X than in group X. With gender-independent dynamics,
this would result in the set of students who move up into rank group X in the next year
being more heavily female.20 The sign of the mechanical effect ∆mech
will depend on which
X
is larger.
The decomposition is an accounting identity that will hold exactly in the data for any
one year if one defines the top X so that it has exactly X students in each year, sets
all transition probabilities like arX to be the actual fraction of students at rank r at t
who scored in the top X at t + 1, and is consistent in what one plugs in for the multiple
occurrences of conditional transition probabilities like afrX /(1 − afrN P ) that are undefined
because the denominator is zero.21 It will also hold exactly in data from multiple years if
one uses appropriate weighted averages.
We instead implement the decomposition by estimating the transition probabilities both
for the full population and for girls as smooth functions of the initial year rank via local
linear regressions with log(Rank) as the right-hand-side variable.22 This makes all of the
transition probabilities continuous in rank and provides a natural definition for the conditional probabilities, avoiding any indeterminacies. We do this separately for students in
9th, 10th, and 11th grades, pooling the data for all six cohorts within each regression.
We can make this intuition precise by further decomposing ∆mech
into terms reflecting these two effects.

Write µcont

and ∆X
to be positive.
21
Plugging in different numbers will, however, alter the results of the decomposition, shifting between
attributing changes to dropouts and to attributing them to differential growth and continuation rates.
22
For example, to estimate arX for X being the top 500 students, we use a dependent variable which
is one for all students who score strictly in the top 500, zero for all students who are outside the top 500
(including students who did not take the test), and an intermediate fraction for all students whose t + 1
score is at the level that spans the boundary. The fraction female in the top X similarly uses fractional
counting for students at the score spanning the boundary.

24

One version of our basic fact about the widening gender gap was that the percentage
of female students in the top 5000 drops from 30.5 in 9th grade to 21.8 in 12th grade. This
is a drop of 8.7 percentage points over three years, which is about 3 percentage points per
year. The first row of Table 10 presents a decomposition of this change.23 It indicates that
by far the largest source of the drop – indeed responsible for 3.6 percentage points, which is
more than 100 percent of the drop – is ∆grow
X , the term in our decomposition which reflects
differences in the rates at which male and female students at ranks r below 5000 improve
their performance and “grow” into the top 5000. Note that this term is designed to control
for how far below the top 5000 cutoff male and female students were in the previous year:
it is due only to differences in the probabilities that male and female students at each given
rank outside the top 5000 move up into the top 5000. This in turn will reflect both the
differences we identified earlier in both average improvements from year to year and in the
variance of students’ improvements.24
Two other features of the dynamics are a little less than one-third as important as the
which reflects the reduced rate at which highly-ranked female students
growth effect: ∆cont
X
which reflects the lower
who take the test maintain their top 5000 position; and ∆entry
X
fraction of female students among “entrant” high scorers. The difference in dropout rates
is a smaller contributor on average.

Table 10: Decomposition of declines in fraction female
The final column indicates that the total drop would be much larger were it not for a
positive mechanical effect: the growth-related subcomponent turns out to be much more
important than the continuation-related subcomponent. To appreciate why this effect can
be large in practice, recall that the fraction female is much higher in the population of
23
The “average” decomposition is obtained by averaging separately estimated decompositions of the
changes from 9th to 10th, 10th to 11th, and 11th to 12th grades.
24
The latter matters here because students outside the top 5000 will need to improve by substantially
more than the average amount to move into the top 5000.

25

test-takers outside the top 5000. For example, for 10th graders it is 0.263 for students in
the top 5000 and 0.401 for students who are ranked between 5,001 and 20,000. Although
each individual 5,001-20,000 student is not very likely to move into the top 5000 in 11th
grade, together they will account for about 23 percent of the year-t + 1 grade 11 top 5000.
If the dynamics were gender-independent, then the fraction of girls in this moving-up group
would be close to 40 percent, and this would substantially bring up the average percent
female variable in the top 5000.
The next three rows of the Table report the separate 9th to 10th, 10th to 11th, and
11th to 12th grade decompositions that went into the average discussed above. Recall that
gender gap widened most from 9th grade to 10th grade. The entry effect is relatively more
important at this stage and the mechanical effect does less to offset the other sources of
female disadvantage. The changes from 10th to 11th grade are very similar to the overall
average. In the 11th to 12th grade transition, the entry effect becomes quite unimportant,
but the growth effect is even more important and dropout also plays a role.
The final two rows of the Table focus on more extreme high achievers. Recall that the
fraction female in the top 500 declined from 18 percent in 9th grade to just 12 percent in
12th grade. This 35 percent decrease was larger than the 29 percent decrease at the top
5000 level, although it is smaller in percentage point terms (about 2 percentage points per
year). The importance of the growth process to the evolution in the gender gap comes
through even more strongly here – differences in the probabilities with which boys and girls
at each lower rank r are able to move into the top 500 are much more important than
the other differences we’ve identified. The entry and dropout effects are both just minor
factors, consistent with the view that few true entrants will make it all the way to the top
500 and few students will drop out after earning such high scores.
The bottom row looks at even more extreme high achievers who scored in the top 50 in
their grade. Here, the dropout and entry effects continue to fade to insignificance relative
to the large growth effect. What remains are the large growth effect and a continuation
effect, again offset in large part by the mechanical effect.25
The small numbers that come up when doing top 50 calculations may make it easier to
understand why the mechanical effect is so large. Going back to Table 5 and inverting the
relationship there to count moves into the top 50, we can infer that 18.1 of the year-t + 1
25

In order to account for noise in the decomposition exercise introduced by the local linear regressions,
we performed a nonparametric bootstrap of the decomposition procedure, resampling at the student level
and holding ranks fixed across 2,000 bootstrap draws. As shown in Table A2 in the Appendix, all terms
in Table 10 are estimated with a great deal of precision, with the exception of several factors at the top 50
level.

26

top 50 will be repeats from last year’s top 50, but they will be joined by 8.1 students who
ranked between 51 and 100 last year, 6.4 who ranked between 101 and 200, and 5 who
ranked from 201-500. On average about 9 percent of the 9th-11th grade top 50 is female.
Ranks 51-100 are about 12 percent female. Ranks 101-200 are about 14 percent female.
And ranks 201-500 are about 18 percent female. Together, the students moving up from
these three lower groups make up about 40 percent of the year-t + 1 top 50. If they were
randomly drawn from their rank groups, then about 16 percent of them would female.
Hence, their presence would increase the overall percent female in the top 50 by about
0.4 × (16 − 9) ≈ 3 percentage points. The magnitude of these mechanical effects can make
our finding of a broadening gender gap even more striking – the widening of the gender gap
over the course of high school occurs despite the fact that every year there are many more
girls in the set of students well positioned to move into the top 50 (or 500 or 5000) than
currently in the top 50 (or 500 or 5000).

Reactions to Disappointment

So far, we have tried to improve our understanding of the widening of the gender gap in high
math achievement over the high school years by providing detailed descriptive evidence on
the dynamics of performance that any potential explanation would have to account for. In
this Section, we exploit the multistage nature of the AMC series to provide evidence with
a more causal flavor on one potential mechanism: gender differences in how students react
to disappointment.
The AMC 10/12 contests on which we have focused are the first stage of a multistage
series. Students who score highly enough on the AMC 10 or 12 are invited to participate in
the American Invitational Mathematics Exam (AIME). Roughly 500 high scorers from that
exam advance to the USA Math Olympiad (USAMO). A few dozen high scorers on that
test are invited to the Math Olympiad Summer Program (MOP). And in the end, six MOP
students are selected to represent the United States at the International Math Olympiad.
While this technically means that all but six of the 200,000 plus students who participate
in the AMC 10/12 contests each year eventually lose, a number of awards are given out
along the way and students take pride in how far they advance. For most of the highachieving students in our sample, the most salient potential accomplishment is qualifying
for the AIME. In a typical year in 1999-2006, roughly 500-750 9th graders, 1000-2000 10th
graders, 3000-5000 11th graders, and 4000-6000 12th graders qualify. Many who make it
will regard AIME qualification as making their AMC season a success. It keeps their math
27

competition season alive for another month, and they will plan to list it on their college
applications. Many who fall just short of the cutoff for AIME qualification will be quite
disappointed.
The “rational” response to falling just short would probably be to redouble one’s efforts:
not having been an AIME qualifier should raise the incremental benefit that qualifying
provides to one’s resume; students have gotten a signal that with a little more preparation
they would have made it; and they’ve also learned (given how much students typically
improve from year to year) that they have a good chance of qualifying in the subsequent
year. But in practice, it seems likely that some students will instead be discouraged and
decide to invest less in their math skills. In light of the literature on gender differences in
self-confidence and interest in competition (e.g., Niederle and Vesterlund 2007; Croson and
Gneezy 2009), one could easily imagine that there are gender differences in this respect.
The rules for advancement from the AMC 10/12 to the AIME are a bit complicated.
Students qualify if they score at least 120 on the AMC 10 or 100 on the AMC 12. They
also qualify if they are among the top 1 percent of US test takers on the particular (A or
B) AMC 10 that they took, or among the top 5 percent on the particular AMC 12. The
rules are an ex ante attempt to treat the tests roughly equally, but in practice the ex post
level of correctly-measured performance at which the cutoff falls will vary depending on
which test a student took: when the absolute score thresholds bind it is better to have
taken whichever test date (A or B) is easier; and the percentage thresholds will not exactly
correct for differences between the talent in the AMC 10 and AMC 12 student pools and
do not attempt to correct for the A vs. B distinction, even though the B pool is historically
stronger.
One’s initial thought might be that this provides a classic opportunity to apply a standard regression-discontinuity design: each year-10/12-A/B combination provides a cutoff;
students with scores just above and below the cutoff are similar in performance but get
different disappointment treatments. Due to the details of the scoring, however, a standard
RD design is not really appropriate. For an RD design, one wants the relationship between
unobserved student characteristics and the score to be smooth around the cutoff. The vagaries of how the AMC scores the exams and penalizes guessing make this unlikely to be a
good assumption. For example, the AMC 10 cutoff is most often 120. The unique way to
get a 120 was to answer all 25 questions and get 20 correct and 5 wrong.26 The unique way
to get the score just below 120, 119.5, was to attempt just 18 of the 25 questions and get
26

The AMC contests changed the guessing penalty after 2007, so the calculations here are different from
what they would be on current contests.

28

17 correct, 1 wrong, with 7 left blank. It is easy to imagine that the 119.5 and 120-scoring
students are different in unobserved ways. The 120 students may be quicker, less accurate,
and more risk loving. A more subtle observation is that the 119.5 students might also be
less sophisticated in not having realized that their chances of reaching a potential 120 cutoff would have been higher if they had guessed on two additional questions.27 Differences
of this variety are not smooth or even monotone. The score just above 120, 120.5, was
obtained by answering 20 of the 25 questions and having 18 correct and 2 wrong, with 5
left blank. Students with this outcome may be more like 119.5 students than 120 students
on the speed/accuracy/risk-loving dimension, but different from both (although more like
120 students) on the strategic sophistication dimension.
The structure of the AMC scoring is, however, very well suited to applying a variant of
the RD design. The patterns in the score vs. “number of questions attempted” relationship
repeat every six points (which corresponds to the point value of a correct vs. an incorrect
answer.) If one compares students with scores that range from 6 points below the AIME
cutoff to 5.5 points above, one can think of the comparison as a pooled comparison of students in 12 different score pairs, each of which should be similar in unobserved dimensions.
For example, students who score 120 (20 correct, 5 wrong) should be similar in unobservables to students who score 114 (19 correct, 6 wrong). And students who score 119.5 (17
correct, 1 wrong) should be similar to students who score 125.5 (18 correct, 0 wrong).
Within each pair, students who make one fewer mistake will be a little stronger on average,
but it seems the difference should not be very large and can presumably be controlled for
reasonably well, as in our earlier regressions which used the log of a student’s within-grade
rank as a flexible control for the general tendency of higher performing students to be less
likely to drop out of participating in the AMCs. Given that the location of the cutoff varies
from year to year and from test to test within each year, we can hope to identify (and
hence control for) this smooth relationship fairly accurately even in a dataset restricted to
students who are within 6 points of the AIME cutoff. Given such a control, a regression
including a dummy for whether a student was just above or below the AIME cutoff on the
test they took can be thought of as investigating the effect of a “disappointment” treatment
that is close to randomly assigned.
Table 11 presents estimates from regressions which use the above approach to examine
the effect of disappointment on the probability that students will drop out of participating in
27
If all 18 of the answers they gave were correct, their score would exceed 120 even if the two added
guesses were both incorrect. If one of the 18 was wrong, they would surpass 120 if either of the two added
guesses were correct, but not if they made no guesses.

29

the AMC tests. The first column contains estimates from a linear regression like those which
we used previously to examine gender-related differences in dropout rates, but estimated on
the sample of students in the close-to-the-cutoff window described above and adding dummy
variables for failing to qualify for the AIME. In light of the differences noted earlier, we
also allow the coefficient on Female dummy to vary across grades.28 We again normalize
within-grade rank separately within each grade, but here have done the normalization so
that the adjusted log of within-grade rank variable has mean zero within each grade for
students with scores exactly at the AIME cutoff. With this normalization, the coefficients
on the Female × Grade X interactions can be thought of as giving the gender difference
in dropout rates for students who qualified for the AIME with the lowest possible score.
Here, we find that 11th grade girls are significantly more likely to drop out of participation
(by 4.1 percentage points) even after having qualified for the AIME. The corresponding
estimates for 9th and 10th grade girls are smaller and not statistically significant, but the
standard errors are such that we also cannot rule out effects on the order of 2-3 percentage
points.
Our main interest in conducting these regressions was on the effect of the disappointing
outcome of failing to qualify for the AIME. The main effect on this variable is substantial,
2.9 percentage points, and highly statistically significant. One way to think about the
magnitude is that it is comparable to the participation gender gap for 11th grade girls: i.e.,
it means that an 11th grade boy with a score just below the AIME cutoff will be almost as
likely to drop out of participating as an 11th grade girl who scored just above the cutoff.
The second main coefficient of interest is the differential effect that failing to qualify
for the AIME has on girls. The estimate indicates that the decrease in the probability of
participation is 2.2 percentage points larger for girls than for boys: i.e., girls are even more
likely than boys to cease participating in the AMCs when they experience a disappointing
outcome. The effect on a girl of just missing the AIME will be the sum of the two estimated
coefficients, so girls with scores just below the AIME cutoff will be 5.1 percentage points
less likely to participate in the following year than girls who just barely qualify for the
AIME. This is consistent with previous literature on gender differences in self-confidence
and responses to competition, suggesting that those findings are relevant even to the set
of highly accomplished girls we are studying. It is also noteworthy in connection with our
earlier finding that the differential dynamic that contributes most to the widening gender
gap is that we see fewer girls moving up and substantially improving their within-cohort
28

As before, the regressions also include unreported year, grade, and B-test dummies.

rank from year to year.
The final three columns of the Table report coefficients from regressions estimated separately on the 9th, 10th, and 11th grade subsamples. Note that the 11th grade subsample
is much larger than the others: there are many more 11th graders than younger students
with scores very close to the AIME cutoff. Several results are clearly significant just in the
11th grade subsample: girls who just barely qualify for the AIME are more likely to drop
than boys with the same score; and students of either gender who just miss out on qualifying are more likely to cease participating. The coefficient on the male-female difference in
the effect of disappointment is also similar to the full sample estimate, but now significant
only at the 14 percent level. While one might have hoped that the regressions in the other
columns would shed light on whether disappointment effects and gender differences therein
are different for 9th and 10th graders, the smaller sample sizes prevent us from saying
much. The point estimates on both the main effect and the female interaction are positive
in all grades and none are significantly different from the all-grades estimates. The main
effect is significantly different from zero at the 1 percent level in the 10th grade subsample
and the female interaction is significant at the 3 percent level in the 9th grade sample, but
mostly we are unable to provide much in the way of statistically significant conclusions
when examining the earlier grades in isolation. Note that we also lose much of our ability
to identify the general relationship between performance levels and dropout rates, which is
a critical control in these regressions.
Disappointment may also affect the performance of students who continue to participate
in the AMC tests by affecting the effort students put in over the course of the following
year. To look for effects of this type, Table 12 reports coefficient estimates from regressions
like those in Table 7 examining the change in within-grade rank between year t and year
t + 1, but as in Table 11 restricting the sample to students with year t scores close to the
AIME cutoff and including dummies for missing the AIME.29
The first main coefficient of interest in this regression is again the coefficient on the
dummy for missing an AIME. We get a positive, significant coefficient, which again suggests
that students are not responding well to disappointment: students with scores just below
the AIME cutoff have a larger increase in their expected year t +1 rank (i.e., they do worse)
than do students with scores just above the AIME cutoff. The magnitude is not very large in
economic terms – students ranks are increasing by a little more than 10 percent. However,
the fact that it is positive is noteworthy: we have seen that scoring just below the AIME

The regressions also include unreported grade and year dummies, and a dummy for the year t test being

Table 12: Reaction to disappointment: changes in performance subsequent to scoring
around the AIME cutoff
cutoff induces some students to drop out, and the most natural guess would be that these
dropouts are relatively weak students, which would result in the pool of continuing students
with scores just below the AIME cutoff being positively selected.
In contrast to our earlier result on girls’ reacting worse to disappointment in terms
of being more likely to drop out, girls who continue participating despite experiencing
disappointment show less of a disappointment effect in their performance. This could reflect
that the sample of continuing girls is more selected, but could also reflect that girls who do
not drop out are less likely to reduce their effort. Regardless, it appears that differences
in dropout rates are the main channel through which gender differences in reactions to
disappointment contribute to a widening gender gap. The positive coefficient estimate on
the Female dummy indicates that (along the lines of what was reported earlier) girls just
above and below the AIME cutoff are still improving by less on average than boys with
comparable scores.
The final three columns of the Table provide estimates from regressions run separately
on the 9th, 10th, and 11th grade subsamples. The estimates on the control variables are
quite consistent across the grades. The main effect of falling below the AIME cutoff is
noticeably larger in 9th and 10th grades than in 11th. Recall that the disappointmentrelated dropout effects were less precisely estimated (and perhaps smaller) in the younger
grades. The significance here means that we can now conclude that adverse effects of

33

disappointment are visible in all three grades. The interaction between the female dummy
and falling below the AIME cutoff is significant only in the 11th grade sample.
To summarize, students appear to react to the disappointment at falling short of the
AIME cutoff both by being more likely to drop out and by improving by less in the subsequent year conditional on not dropping out. The dropout effect is larger for girls and will
be one factor contributing to the widening of the gender gap.

Conclusions

In this paper, we noted that data from the American Mathematics Competitions indicate
that the gender gap among high-achieving math students is already quite large by 9th
grade. Girls comprise just 30 percent of the 5000 highest scoring 9th graders on the AMC
contests, a figure that is quite close to the 33 percent female representation one sees in the
set of high school seniors who earn perfect 800 scores on the mathematics SAT. The AMC
tests make it possible to look much farther into the upper tail of mathematics performance
and draw consistent distinctions among students whose performance would be top-coded
on other tests. Here, we see that the even larger gaps we noted in previous work are already
present by 9th grade. Girls comprise just 18 percent of the 500 highest scoring 9th graders
on the AMC contests and just 8 percent of the top 50. One of our primary takeaways
is that to fully understand the gender gap in high math achievement among high school
students, it will be necessary to examine pre-high school data. We hope that our paper will
spur further work in this direction.
A second main finding of our paper is that the gender gap in high math achievement
widens substantially over the high school years. The largest change occurs between 9th
and 10th grades, but it is a fairly steady process clearly visible in every year. The fraction
female among students who are among the top 5000 in their grade on the AMC test drops
from 30 percent in 9th grade to 22 percent in 12th grade. Among students who are among
the top 500 in their grade the drop is from 18 percent in 9th grade to just 12 percent in 12th
grade. These are substantial changes. They would be hard to reconcile with the simplest
views of gender gaps stemming from some time-invariant biological difference and motivate
looking more closely at the year-to-year dynamics of student performance over the high
school years.
Our initial analysis of the dynamics of high math achievement brings out several new
facts. Two that are particularly important to thinking about the gender gap are that
high-achieving students must substantially improve their absolute performance from year
34

to year to maintain their within-cohort rank, and yet within-cohort ranks are still quite
persistent. The persistence reinforces our earlier comment that pre-high school factors are
important to understanding the gender gap in high school. One can think of the need for
substantial improvement to stay in place as deriving from a combination of two effects. One
is that the typical high-achieving math student is substantially improving their knowledge
and problem solving skills from year to year. The other is that there are many more
students outside the top 500 than in the top 500. Some lower-ranked students are making
far-above-average improvements, and this forces highly ranked students to make aboveaverage improvements to maintain their place. The need for these improvements highlights
that our high-achieving students are exerting substantial effort in bolstering already highly
advanced math skills. There are many, many demands on elite high school students’ time
that could lead to systematic differences in the opportunity costs of and interest in making
such investments.
We have identified four distinct gender-related differences in the dynamics of student
performance that contribute to the widening gender gap. In comparison with boys who
had the same score in the previous year, high-achieving girls are more likely to drop out of
participating in the AMC tests (particularly in 12th grade), and the performance gains of
those who do participate again are lower on average and less variable. Girls are also underrepresented in the pool of high-scoring “entrants” whom we could not match to a score in
the previous year. Our decompositions point to “growth” differences, the underrepresentation of girls in the set of students who manage to move up from lower ranks to high ranks,
as the most important source of the widening gap. The other effects are more moderate in
size, but in combination and cumulated over the years also contribute substantially to the
observed widening of the gender gap.
In 9th grade, the dearth of female entrants is nearly as important, the effect of highscoring girls being less able to hold their ranks is consistently part of the story, and from
11th to 12th grade, dropouts become an issue. But the growth differences are consistently
the largest effect both across grades and across levels of achievement. In most cases, even
by themselves they account for well over 100 percent of the observed broadening of the
gender gap. Again, this suggests a line of further inquiry – why are there so few girls who
move up substantially relative to their cohort in the later high school years?
Our final Section suggests that reactions to disappointment may be part of the answer.
Both boys and girls who experience the disappointing outcome of just barely failing to
qualify for the AIME are more likely to not participate in the following year. And we note

35

that the dropout effect is even larger for girls. Apart from psychological effects related
to disappointment, of course, one could also potentially explain such reactions in more
standard “rational” ways; e.g., conditional on both boys and girls reacting “irrationally”
to disappointment, high-achieving girls might have a greater breadth of other skills and
interests that compete for their time when math seems less promising. We hope to see
future work on this as well.

Score Adjustments

The adjusted scores for students who took a test other than the AMC 12A in year t are
given by formulas of the form
AdjustedScoreijt = b0jt + b1jt Scoreijt ,
where i indexes the student and j ∈ {10A, 10B, 12A} indexes the test that the student
took in year t. For each t from 2000 to 2006, the construction of year t adjusted scores is
based on a regression of year t + 1 AMC 12 scores on dummies for the test taken in year
t, interactions between these dummies and the score on the year t test, and a dummy for
whether the year t + 1 score was on the 12B.30 For each year t test, this regression gives
the predicted year t + 1 AMC 12A score as an affine function of the year t score. We define
the adjusted score for each year t test as the score on the year t AMC 12A that has the
same predicted year t + 1 score given the regression estimates.
We cannot adjust 2007 scores in the same way because our dataset does not contain
2008
P
scores. For the AMC 10 tests, we instead set the slope coefficient b1j2007 ≡ 15 2006
t=2002 b1jt
1 P2006
equal to the average of the b1jt for the previous five years, and set b0j2007 = 5 j=2002 b0jt +
∆j , which is an average of the constants from the previous five years plus an adjustment
factor that reflects whether each 2007 test appears to be easier or harder relative to the
2007 AMC 12A than were previous-year AMC 10’s relative to their contemporaneous AMC
12A’s, in light of data on students who took both tests in each year.31 To determine the
adjustments, we run regressions examining the difference between B-date scores and A-date
scores for students who took both tests in each year on dummies for which tests they took,
ScoreBit −ScoreAit = c10A,t Dummy10Ait −c10B,t Dummy10Bit −c12B,t Dummy12Bit +it ,
P
and set ∆j = cj,2007 − 15 2006
t=2002 cj,t . We adjust AMC 12B scores in a somewhat similar
manner, but imposing that b1,12B,2007 = 1 rather than estimatingthe coefficient.32 We then

where X ≈ 99.4 is the mean AMC 12B score among students who scored at least 90 on the
2007 AMC 12 and attend a school that did not offer the 2007 AMC 10A.33
To give a feel for the linear adjustments, Table A1 reports the contemporaneous AMC
12A scores corresponding to scores of 100 and 150 on each of the other tests. Recall that
30

We run these regressions on the set of students who scored at least 90 on their year t AMC 12 or at
least 105 on the AMC 10 because we will be primarily interested in high-achieving students. The linear
functional forms appear to fit well for students with scores in this range.
31
We do not use this approach in all years because the population of students taking A and B date tests
are quite different and students may select into taking B date test in addition to an A date test if their A
date score was below what they expected.
32
If we had estimated the coefficient via the same procedure we use for the AMC 10 tests, the estimated
coefficient would have been 1.015.
33
The final term is a small correction designed to correct for the fact that we are imposing a slope
coefficient of one when the regression coefficients on the AMC 12B score are not exactly equal to one in the
regressions used to estimate the b012Bt .

100 is roughly the 95th percentile score on the AMC 12 and 150 is a perfect score. The
left and center parts of the Table give the AMC 10A-to-AMC 12 and AMC10B-to-AMC 12
conversions. The median AMC 10 test will have its scores adjusted downward by 13 points
at the 100 level and by 18 points at the 150 level. There is some variation around this – the
AMC 10 seems to have been much easier in its first two years and the 2006 AMC 10 tests
appear to have been nearly as hard as the 2006 AMC 12 for students scoring around 100
– but most tests are within one question (6 points) of the average relative difficulty level.
Most of the AMC 12B adjustments are also less than the point value of one question.
