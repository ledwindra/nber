Requiescat in Pace? The Consequences of High Priced Funerals in South Africa
Anne Case and Alicia Menendez
NBER Working Paper No. 14998
May 2009
JEL No. D12,O12
ABSTRACT
We examine the costs associated with funerals and the effects of funeral spending on household
functioning, using data collected in the Agincourt Demographic Surveillance Site in South Africa.
We find that large outlays of money at the time of the funeral leave households vulnerable to future
hardship. Householdsthat buried a member report lower spending per person, poorer adult affect, and
lower rates of school enrollment for children than do other households. We present evidence consistent
with the financial burden associated with a funeral having direct, adverse effects on households.

1. Introduction
Funerals can serve several purposes, including honoring the dead, comforting those who grieve,
and knitting social fabric for extended families and communities. In Southern Africa, funerals are
generally considered an individual’s most important rite of passage. As a result, they tend to be
more elaborate and expensive than weddings, graduations or naming ceremonies for children.
Households may spend the equivalent of a year’s income for an adult’s funeral, borrowing from
money lenders if need be to have a funeral that befits the status of the household and of the person
who died (Case et al. 2008).
Social norms surrounding funerals were set at a time when people died largely in early
childhood or in old age. Neither type of death would be apt to put financial strain on the
household: young children’s funerals are simple, and older person’s funerals are largely protected
by funeral insurance. The AIDS crisis has changed the mortality patterns observed in Southern
Africa, with the greatest increase in mortality rates found for adults aged 20 to 34 years old (Kahn
et al. 2007a). This increase in mortality in middle age can lead to economic hardship for
households that experience a death, if those who die do not have burial policies and if norms of
what constitutes an appropriate funeral do not change to reflect the change in mortality patterns.
In this paper, we use data we collected on 2922 individuals in 473 households in the
Agincourt Demographic Surveillance Site in South Africa in 2004 to examine funeral spending,
and the impact of the death and funeral spending on household functioning. We find that, on
average, funeral expenses total 3400 Rand when an adult dies—equivalent to 40 percent of
average annual total household expenditure. We find households that experienced a death in the
past five years have significantly lower expenditure per person than do other households. Adults
2

in households that experienced a death report significantly more symptoms of depression and
anxiety, and significantly more problems in their households. Children in households that
experienced a death in the past five years are significantly less likely to be enrolled in school than
are other children their age. Many of these difficulties can be explained by the amount of money
that the household spent on the funeral.
Section 2 introduces the Agincourt Demographic Surveillance Site and presents summary
statistics on the sample drawn for analysis. Section 3 examines funeral costs, and reports
contributions made toward funeral expenses by household members and others. Section 4 looks at
the association between death in the household in the past 5 years and outcomes for members on a
variety of dimensions. Section 5 discusses alternative explanations for our findings, and Section 6
concludes.

2. The Agincourt Demographic Surveillance Site
The Agincourt Health and Population Unit (AHPU) is an educational and research unit located
within the School of Public Health at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. Since
1992, AHPU has been collecting information on birth, death and migration for all individuals
identified as members of the approximately 11,700 households under surveillance in a rural subdistrict in (what is now) Mpumalanga Province, South Africa.1 The area is home to South
Africans and Mozambicans, the latter group settling here legally during the civil war in
Mozambique. Most Mozambicans here have permanent residency status which, according to the
South African Constitutional Court, allows them access to government transfers. However, it is

1

3

more difficult for Mozambicans to access government grants, largely because they lack the
documents necessary to do so (Case and Menendez 2007).

Sample design
In January 2004, using this census information, we drew a stratified random sample of 475
households, with stratification on both citizenship (South African versus Mozambican) and on
whether the household had lost a member to death in the period from June 1, 2002 to May 31,
2003. We chose this window in order to reach households soon enough after the death that
memories of funeral spending would still be fresh, but not so soon that we would offend grieving
members. Our sample was drawn in such a way that refusals could be replaced by a household in
the same (nationality-death status) stratum. Our sample design and the actual number of
households interviewed in each stratum is shown in Box 1.

The sample was designed to be 60 percent South African, and 40 percent Mozambican. In
execution, slightly fewer South African households without a death were interviewed (187 instead
of 190), and one extra South African household with a death was interviewed (96 instead of 95).
These discrepancies were the result of confusion over which households were considered
to have a ‘complete’ interview in cases where the head of household refused to be interviewed.
The survey is composed of a household module, to be completed by a knowledgeable household
member; an adult module, to be completed by each member aged 18 or older; and a child module,
to be completed for each child aged 12 or younger. Some adult household members were
migrants who were not in the field site to be interviewed (although the field team made a great
effort to make appointments with the household to return at month-end, or at Easter, to interview
returning migrants). In addition, some adult members refused to be interviewed. We decided that
if the household module was completed, and at least one adult was interviewed, the household
had a ‘complete’ interview.
In the South African-Death Stratum, an extra household was interviewed because the
household head came home for Easter, after the rest of the household had been interviewed, and
refused to participate. The field team then interviewed a replacement household, but need not
have: we had made a decision that if the head refused to participate, but did not stop other
members from doing so, then that household’s information would be used. However, if a
returning head refused to let any members participate (even if they had already been interviewed),
we did not use that household in our analysis.

5

Data collected
Households were interviewed between January and July 2004. A knowledgeable household
member was asked to provide information about all other members, including their ages,
educational attainment, incomes from a variety of sources and, for younger members, whether
they were currently enrolled in school. In addition, this person was asked about household assets
and household spending on various types of food, phones, fuel, rent, rates, children’s schooling,
and hire purchase payments. We included a battery of questions on death in the household
module. We began by asking about all deaths in the last five years, and went on to ask a set of
questions about the funeral of the person who had died most recently.
Every adult in the household was interviewed separately, and was asked about personal
expenses (such as their clothing and transport) and about their sources of income. We also asked
each about his or her health, mental health, and problems observed in the household.
Summary statistics for the households are presented in Table 1. On average households in
the sample have just over 6 members. Mozambican households are significantly larger than South
African households, with fully one additional member—generally a child under the age of 18.
South African households are more affluent than their Mozambican counterparts, with
expenditure per member on food and other household goods twice as high in South African
households, and with a significantly greater number of assets reported. On average, total monthly
household spending is approximately equal in value to that of the state old-age pension at this
time (which was R740), underscoring the fact that the region is poor.

6

Mozambicans report a greater number of deaths of children age five or younger in the last
5 years, but equal numbers of deaths of members aged 5 to 17, and deaths of adult members (18
and above).
Summary statistics for the most recent death in the household are presented in Table 2,
where results are presented for all such deaths, and separately for deaths of adult members (18
and older). Mozambicans are significantly younger on average at death, and significantly less
likely to be of pension age (60 years old for women, 65 for men). They are also reported to have
completed fewer years of schooling—although educational attainment among the deceased is very
low in general, with fewer than 3 years reported for South Africans also. For adult deaths,
approximately two-thirds of households report that the most recently deceased’s member made an
important financial contribution to the household while they were healthy.
Seventy-five percent of households reporting a death came from the strata targeted for a
recent death. (We also use information on a death in the past five year if that death fell before or
after the window June 1, 2002 to May 31, 2003.) We turn now to the funerals of the most recent
death in each household.

3. Funeral expenses
For the most recent funeral in the past five years, we asked whether the household spent money
for a coffin, meat, groceries, additional cemetery costs, burial and mourning clothing, flowers,
transport for mourners, food for a pre-funeral prayer service, and other expenses.2 If the
respondent reported spending on these categories, we asked the Rand amount for this item.

2

In four cases, no information about the funeral was provided by the knowledgeable household member. In two of
these, the funeral was held elsewhere and the respondent did not know what was spent. In two other cases, the
respondent was not willing to answer these questions.

7

Results of these reports are presented in Table 3. The largest outlays are for a coffin, meat for the
meal following the funeral, and groceries both for the meal and to feed mourners who come to
pay respects (some of whom stay with the mourning household for several days). Sixty-five
percent of households report purchasing a coffin and, conditional upon this purchase, report
spending 2200 Rand. The vast majority (85 percent) report buying meat, and among those who
purchased meat, 1100 Rand were spent. Three quarters bought groceries, and those who did spent
700 Rand. The average funeral expenses totaled 2900 Rand, with the relatively wealthier South
Africans spending 3700 Rand on average and Mozambicans, 1600 Rand. These totals are
presented for all funerals in which any spending was reported. If we restrict the sample to a
(possibly more reliable) sample of respondents who remember what was spent on meat, funeral
spending totaled 3195 Rand on average.
Significantly less is spent on the funerals of small children. Figure 1 presents total
spending on funerals by the age of the deceased. It is clear that, for those younger than age 6,
funerals are much more modest. On average, for the funerals of children aged 0 to 5, 682 Rand
were spent. For the funerals of household members older than age 5, on average 3415 Rand were
spent. As seen in Figure 2, when we restrict the sample to those who were older than age 5 at their
death, there is no relationship between age and funeral spending.3 This is true even if large
outliers (e.g., two funerals where more than 18000 Rand are reported) are removed from the
sample. In what follows, we will use the fact that the funerals for household members ages 6 to 17
are as expensive as funerals for adult members (many of whom had been contributing to
household income before their deaths) to argue that it is the death of a member greater than age 5,

3

It is interesting to contrast this with the age-funeral spending profile found among the Zulus, where funeral spending
increases with age through age 70 (Case et al. 2008).

8

or spending on funerals for members greater than age 5, that is responsible for the hardships that
households report after the death of a household member.
Table 4 presents information on who paid for the funeral in the Demographic Surveillance
Site. In 81 percent of funerals, household members contributed money and, when they did, on
average they contributed almost 2500 Rand. This includes any money that the household received
from a burial society or funeral policy for the deceased. Extended family, not in the household, is
reported to contribute to 73 percent of all funerals. They contribute a smaller but still substantial
sum (1358 Rand on average). The community is reported to contribute in 72 percent of all
funerals, and the church in more than half of all funerals, although in both cases substantially less
is contributed. Employers contribute to only one in ten funerals, but when they do contribute the
amount is substantial (2900 Rand on average). The knowledgeable household member, reporting
on the funeral, can remember 3200 Rand of contributions on average, which is close to what was
reported on funeral spending (2900 Rand). This adding up need not have happened – questions on
what was spent are asked in a separate section from questions on who contributed what – so this
provides a check on the quality of the data.
Mechanisms have evolved in South Africa to help individuals save for funerals. These
include membership in a burial society, or the purchase of a funeral policy with a funeral parlor or
an insurance company. Money paid into a funeral policy can only be drawn upon at death. For
approximately 20 to 30 Rand per month (more, if one is insuring additional household members),
individuals are guaranteed that some expenses incurred for their funerals will be paid for by the
insurer.

9

Table 5 presents information on whether the deceased was covered by a burial society or
funeral policy and, if so, whether that fund paid money or contributed a coffin, food or transport
for the funeral. In a third of all cases, the deceased was covered by a funeral policy or burial
society. In a quarter of all deaths, the policy paid money (4750 Rand on average). In 20 percent of
cases, the policy contributed a coffin—which would have saved the household approximately
2200 Rand in funeral costs on average.
Ownership of a funeral policy is highly correlated with being of pension age. Each month,
after receiving their pension, pensioners can pay into their burial account at the pension pay point.
(Funeral parlors and insurance companies are the only private firms allowed to conduct business
inside pension pay points, which are generally surrounded by a fence or barrier of some sort.)
Seventy percent of pension-aged people who died had a funeral policy, in contrast to 27 percent
of those not yet of pension age. Why would younger adults not belong to a burial society? We can
only speculate, but one possibility, suggested to us by Karla Hoff, “is the same reason that Duflo
et al. (2008) find that farmers aren’t keen on buying fertilizer when they need it (at the beginning
of the season) but are very responsive to the option to buy fertilizer immediately after their
harvest. It might be that people don’t like to plan, but if they have money in hand, and a seller is
strategically positioned when they receive cash, then they will buy what they know they will need
later on.” (Karla Hoff, personal correspondence.) A non-competing hypothesis is that planning
for one’s own death is painful, and more so for the young than for the old.
In what follows, we will focus primarily on the number of deaths and the ages of those
who died in the household in the past five years. We will not use information on whether a burial
policy paid out, in order to sidestep the issue of whether people who have burial policies know
10

how to plan, which may then be a marker that their households are better organized. We turn to
the consequences of deaths in the household in the next section.

4. Household and individual outcomes
Our identification strategy in quantifying the impact of death and funeral expenses is to assume,
by nationality, that households that had experienced a death would be similar in measures of
wellbeing to those that did not, if the death had not occurred. We will return in Section 5 to
discuss alternative explanations for our findings.

Expenditure per member in 2004
A knowledgeable household member reported expenditures on all household goods, the sum of
which we use to construct a marker of current household economic status. Table 6 presents results
from OLS regressions in which we regress the log of monthly expenditure per member in 2004 on
deaths in the household in the past five years, together with other controls, in order to characterize
the impact of the death and funeral.4
Column 1 controls separately for the number of deaths of members aged 18 and older,
aged 6 to 17, and aged 0 to 5 years old. All regressions include a control for whether the head of
household was Mozambican. Consistent with the information presented in Table 1, expenditure
per member is approximately twice as high in South African households than in Mozambican
households.

4

All regressions include an index for the number of spending categories for which the knowledgeable household
member knew something was spent, but does did not know the amount.

11

We find spending in households that lost an adult in the past five years is approximately
20 percent lower than in households that did not. The point-estimate on the number of deaths of
members aged 6 to 17, although imprecisely estimated, also suggests approximately 20 percent
lower spending in households who lost members in that age range. An F-test does not reject that
the impact of an adult death and that of a member aged 6 to 17 are the same. Spending on the
death of a child aged 0 to 5 appears to be orthogonal to current log expenditure per member: the
point estimate is small (−0.02) and not significantly different from zero.
In order to present some interaction terms in a parsimonious way, we combine the number
of deaths of members ages 6 to 17 and those ages 18 and older, and present results in column 2.
As in column 1, each death in this age group is associated with a 20 percent reduction in
household spending per person. Perhaps because only 8 percent of households had multiple
deaths in this period, results are very similar if we use an indicator for any deaths of members
aged 6 or above (column 3 of Table 6). We continue to find expenditure per member in
households with a death is approximately 20 percent lower. We find no difference between deaths
of members ages 6 to pension age and those above pension age, which can also be seen in column
3 of Table 6: an indicator that the deceased was of pension age has no significant association with
log expenditure per member.
The inclusion of a control that the deceased’s income was ‘financially important when
healthy,’ in column 4, reduces the coefficient on the number of deaths aged 6 or above, from 22 to
16 percent. The coefficient on number of death is still negatively and significantly associated with
current household spending, while the indicator that the deceased’s income was financially
important is not.
12

In both South African and Mozambican households, death of a member is associated with
a 20 percent reduction in spending per person. Column 5 includes an interaction term between the
number of deaths of members above the age of five with an indicator that the household was
Mozambican. The coefficient on this interaction term is small and insignificantly different from
zero.
We also tested whether the impact of a more recent death was larger than that of a death
that occurred more than two years ago, to see whether households appear to rebound after a
funeral. The regression in column 6 includes an indicator that the most recent death was in 2002,
2003, or 2004 (as opposed to 1999, 2000, or 2001). The coefficient is small, insignificant and of a
counterintuitive sign.
The large sums of money spent on funerals must come from somewhere. Results in Table
6 are consistent with households—whatever their financing mechanism—having to reduce future
expenditures per member to pay for funerals. These findings are qualitatively similar to those of
other studies reviewed in Naidu and Harris (2005).

Problems in the household
Each adult was asked questions about whether he or she was currently experiencing certain
problems. Specifically, the question was asked “Is ___ a problem for you right now?” We present
the association between reports of having problems and death in the household in Table 7, where
all regressions control for age, sex, years of education and nationality. We find that reports of “not
having enough money” and “unemployment of family members” are positively, but
insignificantly, associated with recent death. We find a significant association between death and
13

reports of “not having enough food,” “quarrels in the household” and “safety in the
neighborhood.” All are approximately five percentage points higher with each death of a member
aged 6 or older. For ‘food’ and ‘quarrels,’ the association between death in the household and
these problems can be explained by the lower socioeconomic status of households in which
someone died: when a control for expenditure per member is added to each regression, the
associations between food and death, and between quarrels and death, become smaller and
insignificant.

Investments in children
The household module asked whether each member aged 5 to 25 was enrolled in school. We use
this as a measure of current investments made in children. (We chose not to use educational
attainment, because it may reflect school going during the period when the deceased was in need
of care.) All regressions include controls for sex, age, age squared, the number of assets the
household owns, and the log expenditure per member.
The first two columns of Table 8 present OLS regression results on the association
between enrollment and the number of deaths of members by age group (18 and above, 6 to 17,
and age 5 and younger). The last three columns present results on the number of deaths of
members aged 6 or older. Beginning with results by age group, we find each adult death reduces
the probability of enrollment by 4 percentage points, and the death of a 6 to 17 year old reduces
the probability by 5 percentage points (although the latter is just shy of being statistically
significant). An F-test shows that the difference in the effect of an adult death and that of a 6 to 17
year old are not statistically different (F-test=0.08, p-value=0.772). Results in column 3, where all
14

deaths above age 5 are combined, show a similar result. Results in columns 1 and 3 are changed
by the inclusion of controls for the amount of money spent by the household on the most recent
funeral in the past 5 years. (This is zero if the household did not experience a death.)5 Adding the
household’s expenditure on the funeral and that expenditure squared, the impact of the number of
deaths in past 5 years becomes statistically insignificant, whether these deaths are expressed by
age category (column 2), or as the number of deaths above the age of 5 (column 5). The
household’s funeral spending variables are jointly significantly different from zero, whether
deaths are expressed by age category (F-test = 3.27, p-value = 0.038) or as deaths above the age
of 5 (F-test = 2.76, p-value = 0.064). The household’s funeral spending variables suggest that
each 1000 Rand that the household puts toward the funeral reduces the probability that a member
of school going age will be enrolled by approximately 3 percentage points.

Depression and anxiety
Table 9 presents results on adults reporting symptoms of depression, using questions from an
abbreviated CES-D depression scale that asked how often the respondent felt the following
-

I felt I could not stop feeling miserable, even with help from my family and friends.
I felt depressed.
I felt sad.
I cried a lot.
I did not feel like eating. My appetite was poor.
I felt everything I did was an effort.
My sleep was restless.
I could not get ‘going.’

5

Results on the impact of household funeral spending are very similar if we restrict the sample to only households
that experienced a death in the past five years.

15

Respondents were asked to report whether, in the last week, they felt these symptoms hardly ever,
some of the time, or most of the time. Table 9 presents mean responses for these indicators in
square brackets for each depression symptom. Approximately a third of all respondents report
having felt miserable, depressed, sad, and having had restless sleep. A quarter report having a
poor appetite and an inability to get going. We regress these indicators on age, sex, nationality,
years of education, and the number of deaths in the household in the past five years. Women are
significantly more likely to report many of these symptoms. Controlling for age, sex and
nationality, education appears to be protective against depression. The number of deaths in the
household is significantly associated with reports of feeling miserable, feeling depressed, crying a
lot, having restless sleep, and reporting an inability to get going.
We aggregate the eight indicators together into an index, and regress that index on the
number of deaths in the household of members aged 6 or older, in the first set of columns of
Table 10.6 We find each death increases the depression index by a quarter of a point, on average.
In results estimated but not reported in Table 10, we find that women report a significantly larger
number of symptoms, all else held constant. We find education, household asset holdings, and
expenditure per member negatively and significantly associated with depression.
In column 2, we restrict the sample to respondents for whom household spending on the
funeral is not missing, to make sure the results are not driven by a change is sample composition,
and in column 3 we add to this regression the amount of money that household members
contributed to the most recent funeral, and that amount squared. We find the depression index
increases with the amount spent on the funeral through a spending level of 7200 Rand – well

6

Results are qualitatively similar if we score a report of ‘most’ of the time as a 2, and ‘some’ of the time as a ‘1’
before aggregating the responses into an index.

16

beyond the 95th percentile of household spending on funerals. Moreover, the inclusion of the
household’s financial contribution to the funeral reduces the impact of deaths from 0.20 to –0.02,
and leaves it insignificantly different from zero.7 Coefficients on several other factors associated
with depression (sex, education, assets, expenditure per member) are largely unchanged. (These
results were estimated but are not reported in Table 10.)
The last three columns in Table 10 investigate the association between death in the
household and reports of anxiety. Specifically, we asked respondents whether “during the past 12
months, did [they] ever have a period lasting one month or longer when most of the time [they]
felt worried, tense or anxious.” On average, 39 percent of respondents reported that they had.
Deaths above age 5 are associated with a 5.5 percentage point increase in the probability of
reporting a period of anxiety lasting a month or longer. However, including controls for the
household’s financial contribution to the most recent funeral, which is significantly associated
with reports of anxiety, reduces the coefficient on the death variable to 0.001 and leaves it
insignificantly different from zero.

5. Discussion
Results in Section 4 suggest that death in the household and household spending on funerals leave
household members vulnerable: spending in their households is significantly lower following the
funeral, relative to other households; children in households that experienced a death are
significantly less likely to be enrolled in school; and adults are significantly more likely to report
problems in the household, symptoms of depression, and periods of anxiety.

7

Results on the impact of household funeral spending on depression and anxiety are very similar if we restrict the
sample to only households that experienced a death in the past five years.

17

Children’s lower rates of enrollment and adults’ reports of depression and anxiety
following the death of a member aged 6 or older can be ‘explained’ by the household’s financial
contribution to the funeral. The larger the contribution, the less likely it is that children are
enrolled in school, and the more likely it is that adults are depressed and anxious. There are,
however, alternative explanations for these findings.
We did not observe households prior to the deaths reported in 2004, so we do not know
what was true in households before a member passed away. Perhaps spending in these households
was always lower than in other households. Children in these households may always have been
less likely to be enrolled in school, and adults in these households always more prone to
depression and anxiety.
To explore whether households that experienced a death are different from other
households in observable ways, we looked in the data for (relatively stable) markers of household
socioeconomic status (SES). At the household level, we looked at the association between death
in the households and the number of assets the household owned; maximum education of any
member; whether the household has access to any kind of toilet facility or latrine; and whether the
household lived in a formal dwelling. We present results on these measures of SES in Table 11,
where the first four regressions are run at the household level. We find no association between the
death of members aged 6 or older and assets holdings, maximum education of a member, or an
indicator that the household lived in a formal dwelling. Households that experienced a death
might have been asset-poor before the death or may have sold off assets to pay for the funeral, but

18

we find no evidence to support either of these ideas.8 To the extent we find any significant
relationships between deaths and markers of SES, we find that the deaths of infants and children
under the age of 6 are significantly associated with larger asset holdings, and greater education of
the most educated member in the household. In addition, deaths above the age of 5 are associated
with an increased probability of reporting access to any type of toilet facility. Again, these do not
strengthen the case that households that had deaths were poorer prior to the death, and we are
only picking up that fact in our current data.9
We also regress the educational attainment of all adults in the household aged 21 or higher
on deaths in the household, with controls for nationality, sex and age. These results, in the last
column of Table 11, are also consistent with households that experienced a death being much like
other households in the demographic surveillance area.
There are other possible explanations for our findings. For example, the size of the funeral
might be larger, the higher the status of the person who died. The loss of a high status member
might lead to depression and anxiety among adults left behind. Although we can’t rule this out,
we can report that household spending on funerals, for those who died above the age of 5, does
not correlate with the age of the person who died, or whether the deceased was the head of
household, or whether the deceased’s financial contribution to the household was important when
he or she was healthy. Funeral spending is significantly correlated with the education of the
deceased, but only marginally so. So, while this is a possible explanation, we find little evidence
8

In field work in Zululand we rarely observed households selling assets to pay funeral expenses (Case et al. 2008).
This is consistent with findings of Roth (1999), who argues that this is largely because the time between the sale of
the asset and the receipt of cash is too long for households who need immediate cash to pay for funeral-related items.

Having a better educated member may be correlated with the age structure of the household. The lack of association
between death in the household and maximum education of a member continues to be observed in regressions that
also control for the age structure of the household.

to support it. (That said, we have made very little progress in understanding the determinants of
funeral spending in the field site. If we were able to identify why some funerals were larger than
others in the Agincourt Demographic Surveillance Area, we might be in a better position to
evaluate the argument that the funeral is a marker for status, and it is the loss of a high status
member that leads to future misfortune in the household.)

6. Conclusion
A household that experiences the death of a member is at risk for poorer outcomes on a number of
dimensions following the funeral, and the risk appears to be greater, the more the household spent
to bury their dead. The South African Council of Churches has called repeatedly for “appropriate
and affordable” funerals. (See, for example, http://www.sacc.org.za/docs/AnRept05.pdf .) Our
results suggest that reining in the size of funerals may improve households’ long run prospects.
