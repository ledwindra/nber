Did California’s Shelter-in-Place Order Work? Early Coronavirus-Related Public Health Effects

ABSTRACT
On March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-33-20 2020,
which required all residents of the state of California to shelter in place for all but essential
activities such as grocery shopping, retrieving prescriptions from a pharmacy, or caring for
relatives. This shelter-in-place order (SIPO), the first such statewide order issued in the United
States, was designed to reduce COVID-19 cases and mortality. While the White House Task
Force on the Coronavirus has credited the State of California for taking early action to prevent a
statewide COVID-19 outbreak, no study has examined its impact. This study is the first to
estimate the effect of SIPO adoption on health. Using daily state-level coronavirus data and a
synthetic control research design, we find that California’s statewide SIPO reduced COVID-19
cases by 125.5 to 219.7 per 100,000 population by April 20, one month following the order. We
further find that California’s SIPO led to as many as 1,661 fewer COVID-19 deaths during this
period. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that there were about 400 job losses per life
saved during this short-run post-treatment period.

1. Motivation

"I simply do not know if our aggressive actions early on ... have had the intended
effect … I certainly am hoping and praying that that is the case. We still need the
data to confirm that.”
- Grant Colfax, San Francisco Director of Public Health, March 31, 2020

The 2020 U.S. coronavirus outbreak is one of the most serious public health challenges in
American history. The U.S. has seen more reported COVID-19 cases between January 1, 2020
and April 16, 2020 than reported polio cases between 1910 and 2010 (Ochmann and Roser
2020). The transmission of COVID-19 is presently believed to occur largely through exposure to
respiratory droplets, usually emitted during coughing, sneezing, or nose-blowing (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention 2020a), but may also occur through natural respiratory expulsion
(Fineberg 2020). The primary strategies suggested by governments worldwide to reduce the
spread of COVID-19 have been frequent handwashing, mask-wearing in public, and social
distancing (Australian Government Department of Health 2020; Public Health England 2020;
Public Health Agency of Canada 2020; White House 2020).
In contrast to many countries throughout the world, many of the authorities used to
combat public health threats in the United States rest not with the Federal government, but
largely with state and local officials. The primary state and local policy strategy to prevent the
spread of coronavirus is the enactment of shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs), sometimes called “stay
at home” orders. The State of California was at the forefront of issuing comprehensive SIPOs as
the COVID-19 crisis unfolded nationwide. On March 17 and 18, 2020, 12 California counties

1

and the City of Berkeley adopted SIPOs.1 And on the evening of March 19, Governor Gavin
Newsom announced the nation’s first statewide SIPO, earning immediate attention in the
national news media. California Executive Order N-33-20 2020 stated:

“To protect public health, I as State Public Health Officer and Director of the California
Department of Public Health order all individuals living in the State of California to stay
home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations
of the federal critical infrastructure sectors…” (California Executive Order N-33-20
2020).

This statewide executive order required all California residents to remain in their homes
for all but essential activities such as purchasing food or medicine, caring for others, exercise, or
traveling for employment deemed essential. While grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants
providing takeout or delivery service, and other essential businesses were permitted to remain
open, most other non-essential businesses were ordered closed. 2 In addition, residents were
advised to continue to maintain a six-foot distance with non-household members with whom
they come in contact and public gatherings of non-household members were strongly
discouraged.
Violations of the SIPO were subject to a $1,000 fine and up to 6 months of imprisonment
(Allday 2020), though enforcement most often occurred through social pressure and warnings for

1

On March 16, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti implemented a non-essential business closure order. The seven
counties that adopted a SIPO on March 17 were: Alameda, Contra Costa, Mendocino, San Francisco, San Mateo,
Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. The five counties that adopted a SIPO on March 18 were: Monterey, San Benito,
Solano, Sonoma, and Ventura.
2
California’s statewide SIPO was soon followed by the closing of many public parks or beaches (California
Department of Parks and Recreation 2020), driven in part by public outrage over the surge in beach parties and
picnics immediately following the executive order (Kopetman 2020).

first offenses. State SIPOs appear to have had increased social distancing (Abouk and Heydari
2020; Fry 2020), with non-essential travel falling 40 to 60 percent following California’s SIPO
(COVID-19 Community Mobility Report).
In issuing the SIPO, Governor Newsom implored residents of California “to meet this
moment and flatten the curve together” (Romero 2020). Thus, an important policy rationale was
not simply to curb the pandemic’s growth in California, but also to delay its peak, allowing the
state additional time to obtain the necessary ventilators, hospital beds, and medical staff in place
to meet the surge in demand for services among those who test positive (Baker and Fink 2020;
Greenstone and Nigam 2020; Ranney et al. 2020; Tsai et al. 2020; Hicks and Marsh 2020).
The White House Coronavirus Task Force singled out two states, including California,
for their early adoption of mandatory social distancing policies:

“[Dr. Deborah] Birx said the experiences of California and Washington give her
hope that other states can keep the coronavirus under control through social
distancing. That’s because they moved quickly to contain the early clusters of
coronavirus by closing schools, urging people to work from home, banning large
gatherings and taking other measures now familiar to most Americans.” (The
Associated Press, March 31, 2020)

Following the adoption of California’s SIPO, 40 additional states and the District of
Columbia enacted similar statewide SIPOs between March 20, 2020 and April 20, 2020. And by
early April, over 90 countries worldwide, representing half of the world’s population, requested
or ordered their citizens to stay at home (Sandford 2020).

3

There are a number of important reasons to single out California’s SIPO in studying its
effects on COVID-19 infection and mortality. First, California was the first state to implement a
statewide order, an important policy feature designed to prevent within-state spillovers of
infectious disease across neighboring counties, cities, and townships with heterogeneous local
orders. Second, California ranks 12 out of 51 states (including the District of Columbia) in
population per square mile (World Population Review) and 2 out of 51 in percent living in
urbanized areas and urban clusters (Iowa Community Indicators Program). 3 The spread of
coronavirus is exacerbated by increased population density, which generates greater
opportunities for transmission among frequently interacting individuals (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2020b). This makes California a location with a high potential for rapid
spread of the disease.
Third, California implemented its SIPO at a unique time: early in the cycle of an
outbreak, when the rate of growth in observed coronavirus case rates was quite low relative to
other states that ultimately implemented SIPOs. The average daily growth in confirmed
coronavirus cases in the four days prior to SIPO enactment was 19.1 percent in California. No
other SIPO-implementing state in the upper 25th percentile of the state population density or
urbanicity distribution had an average daily coronavirus growth rate lower than California during
this period. As a comparison, New York, which had the highest per-capita case rate in the nation
throughout much of the outbreak, had an average daily coronavirus case growth rate of 39.5
percent in the four days prior to its enactment of a SIPO. In this context, California may provide
a cleaner natural experiment in relation to later adopters, while also informing the efficacy of the
decision to enact a SIPO early in the outbreak cycle. Finally, at this early stage of assessing the

In 2019, the population density in California was 253.7 persons per square mile; 95.0 percent of residents lived in
an urbanized area or urban cluster.

short-run public health effects of SIPOs, California has more days of post-treatment data than
any other state, critical for analyzing the public health benefits of an epidemic with potentially
exponential short-run contagion and lagged mortality effects.
While there is speculation by the White House Coronavirus Task Force that SIPOs have
been effective at “bending the case curve,” there is little rigorous empirical analysis of this
question. This study is the first to examine early public health effects of a statewide SIPO.
Using 40 days of state-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related
deaths, this study provides evidence on the public health effects of California’s SIPO during the
crucial early weeks of the policy. Estimates from our preferred synthetic control models show
that California’s SIPO led to a 125.5 to 219.7 per 100,000 population reduction in COVID-19
cases and a 1.9 to 4.2 per 100,000 population reduction in COVID-19-related deaths per 100,000
during the first month following its enactment. These findings are robust to the selection of
observables (i.e. pre-treatment COVID-19 rates, population density, urbanicity, and other
COVID-related policies) to generate the weights to construct our counterfactual. We find that
the number of cases averted and lives saved were much larger in the second and third weeks
following the SIPO’s adoption, consistent with growing public health benefits over the period
during which the outbreak was exponentially growing. Back-of-the-envelope calculations
suggest that there were approximately 8 to 14 job losses per coronavirus case averted and 421 to
917 job losses per life saved during this short-run post-SIPO window in California.

2. Background on Coronavirus
In December 2019, an outbreak of a new zoonotic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which
causes the disease COVID-19, was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (World Health
Organization 2020a). The symptoms of COVID-19 resemble that of influenza, including fever,
5

cough, and shortness of breath (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020c). However,
severe respiratory symptoms generate a mortality rate that may be an order of magnitude greater
than that of the common flu (World Health Organization 2020b, House Oversight and Reform
Committee 2020). Deaths from COVID-19-related illness are heavily concentrated among the
elderly and those with underlying health conditions such as respiratory ailments, heart disease,
diabetes, or high blood pressure (Wu and McGoogan 2020; Verity et al. 2020; CDC Covid-19
Response Team 2020).
The substantial epidemiological risk from this new coronavirus is exacerbated by (i) a
high degree of contagion (Thackeray 2020; Cascella et al. 2020), (ii) the possibility that
transmission may occur among those who are asymptomatic (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention 2020a; Mandavilli 2020, Whitehead 2020, Li et al. 2020), and (iii) lack of adequate
testing (Cohen 2020, Shear et al. 2020, Rabin et al. 2020, Desiderio and Levine 2020). In the
main, transmission of COVID-19 occurs via respiratory droplets, usually emitted during
coughing, sneezing, or nose-blowing (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a, World
Health Organization 2020c & 2020d). There is also some evidence that the disease may be
easily transmitted through normal breathing function in common air space (Fineberg 2020). The
incubation period for COVID-19 is 2 to 14 days, during which time transmission may also be
possible (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020b, Li et al. 2020).
U.S. pharmaceutical companies, in partnership with the public sector, have begun clinical
trials for a COVID-19 vaccine (White House 2020, Food and Drug Administration 2020).
However, a longer-run medical solution such as a vaccine is unlikely to solve short-run capacity
constraints faced by hospitals, which have faced a sharp increase in demand for medical services
among coronavirus patients (Secon 2020, Seewer 2020, Kaste 2020, Marquez and Moghe 2020).

6

Fears over shortages of ventilators (Baker and Fink 2020, Ranney et al. 2020), intensive care unit
beds (Tsai et al. 2020, Hicks and Marsh 2020), and protective personal equipment (James 2020,
Petras and Loehrke 2020, Ranney et al. 2020, World Health Organization 2020e) have instead
led policymakers to seek strategies to “flatten the curve” of infections, reducing the peak number
of infections and spreading its incidence over time (Meredith 2020). The World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended that individuals frequently wash hands, avoid shaking hands
with others, self-isolate when presenting flu-like symptoms, and avoid all unnecessary contact
with non-household members through the practice of social distancing (World Health
Organization 2020b). The adoption of shelter-in-place orders is the dominant policy strategy to
induce such distancing.
SIPOs can affect COVID-19 cases and deaths through a number of channels. As public
health officials and epidemiologists expect, reducing exposure of uninfected individuals to those
who are infected via social distancing should reduce the transmission rate of the virus. However,
there are other indirect channels through which SIPOs could impact reported cases and deaths.
SIPOs may affect testing and coronavirus-related mortality because infected individuals who are
unaware of their infection choose to stay at home rather than seek out testing or other medical
care. This may be because of fears of contagion at medical facilities or because of a desire to
adhere to a “civic duty” to shelter in place. In addition, as SIPOs may necessitate an increase in
public resources spent on patrol and enforcement, they may reduce resources available for public
health services. On the other hand, as SIPOs are expected to reduce the demand for “nonessential” medical procedures such as well care visits or elective surgery, they may free up
resources for those most at risk for coronavirus-related mortality.

3. Data and Methodology
3.1 Data
In order to examine the “first stage” compliance with the California SIPO, we utilize
publicly available data from SafeGraph Inc. 4 For each state (and county) on each day SafeGraph
provides a shelter-in-place index, based on the percent of individuals staying at home during the
day. The metric is calculated from spatial data generated using anonymous cell phone pings.
First, each cell phone is assigned a “home” (or 153m by 153m square) based on a common
nighttime location over a baseline period. SafeGraph then calculates the percent staying at
home, i.e. the fraction of cell phones in a geographic unit (state, county, etc.) that do not leave
the “home” for any given day. 5 The shelter-in-place index is the percentage point change in the
number of cell phones staying at home relative to the baseline of February 6, 2020 through
February 12, 2020. 6
To examine the short-run public health effects of the statewide order, we utilize a panel
of state-specific daily counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 12, 2020 through April
20, 2020. These data are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
made public by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 7 As of April 20, there were a total of 778,328
confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States, 4.3 percent (33,862) of which were in
California, and 37,372 coronavirus-related deaths, 3.2 percent (1,223) of which were in
California.

Data and detailed descriptions of variable construction are available at:
https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-shelter-in-place

SafeGraph makes adjustments for small geographic units which are not relevant for a state-level analysis.
6
So a value of 25 is for the shelter in place index could represent an increase from of 12% of phones staying at
home at baseline to 37% of phones staying at home (37-12=25).

Figure 1 shows state-specific trends in cumulative coronavirus rates per 100,000
population in each state. Daily cases can be calculated as the slope of this cumulative case
distribution. Over the period under study, the average coronavirus case rate in California was
30.8 per 100,000 population, and its growth rate from March 12 to April 20 ranked 6th lowest
among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, California had the lowest case
growth rate among the top 25th percentile of most highly urbanized states. California also had
the lowest case rate among the top 25th percentile of most highly densely populated states.
Figure 2 shows the trends in cumulative coronavirus-related death rates per 100,000
population. Between March 12 and April 20, the COVID-19 death rate in the United States grew
by 8.56 deaths per 100,000 population, while it grew by less than one half as much (3.08 per
100,000 population) in California. New York, New Jersey, Washington, Louisiana, and
Massachusetts had among the highest rates of coronavirus-related deaths at the end of the sample
period. In terms of the death rate, the growth in the COVID-19 death rate in California ranked
lowest among the top 25th percentile of most highly urbanized states.
Figure 3 shows trends in coronavirus case rates for each county in the state of California
during the sample period. As noted above, prior to the statewide SIPO on March 19, 12 counties
and the City of Los Angeles adopted SIPOs. Early adopting counties are shaded black and all
other counties are shaded gray. We find that the growth rate in coronavirus cases from March 12
through April 20 in early adopting California counties was about 9 percent. This compares to an
average growth rate of 11 percent in the remaining counties in the state who were bound by the
statewide order.8

Appendix Figure 1 shows trends in coronavirus mortality rates for each county in California during the sample
period. Due to many low population counties with zero deaths for much of the sample period it is difficult to draw
reliable inference with regards to county level SIPOs and mortality.

3.2 Synthetic Control Design
We use the synthetic control method introduced by Abadie et al. (2010) to infer the
causal impact of SIPOs on the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and number of COVID19-related deaths per 100,000 population in California. This method uses data on pre-treatment
COVID-19 case (or mortality) rates and observable characteristics of states that may influence
the spread of the virus (i.e. population density, urbanicity, emergency decrees for major disaster
area, travel restrictions, and the number of tests conducted). 9 The synthetic control approach
generates a counterfactual designed to capture how coronavirus cases would have evolved in
California in the absence of its SIPO.
Our chief outcomes of interest, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , measure the cumulative

number of confirmed coronavirus cases and number of coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000

population in state i at day t. We estimate the unobserved counterfactual (“synthetic California”)
as a weighted linear combination of states included in a donor pool. The weights are chosen so
as to generate a synthetic state that is as similar as possible to California on key observables.
Given the importance of the selection (i) of states to be included in the donor pool, and (ii)
observable characteristics on which to closely match California to its synthetic counterpart, it is

9

Population density is measured as the ratio of state population to land area in square miles and is available from
U.S. Census (see: https://www.census.gov/geographies.html). Urbanicity is measured as percentage of total
population living in urban areas and is available from Iowa Community Indicators Program (see:
https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/urban-pct-states). Emergency major disaster declarations are
measured as a state with disaster that exceeds the response capabilities of the state and local governments, and longterm recovery assistance is needed and are available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (see:
https://www.fema.gov/disasters). Travel restrictions are measured as states that restrict residents from traveling to
other states and/or states that restrict residents of other states from entering the state. COVID-19 tests are measured
as the natural log of total coronavirus tests reported by each state. These data are available from COVID Tracking
Project (see: https://covidtracking.com).

incumbent on researchers to offer a theoretical defense of these choices and to explore the
sensitivity of estimated policy impacts to these choices (Ferman 2019).
Our primary donor pool is comprised of a total of 42 state and the District of Columbia:
10 states that had never enacted a SIPO during our sample period, and 32 states and the District
of Columbia that adopted a SIPO at least 5 days after California did so. We select this five-day
period because it is the median incubation period of COVID-19 (Lauer et al. 2020), and thus
gives the case data from California sufficient time to reflect underlying changes in the
transmission rate before any of the donor states implement their own SIPOs. Coupled with
information on the date at which each state implemented a SIPO (Appendix Table 1), our
decision rule eliminates the following states from our donor pool: Illinois, New Jersey, New
York, Connecticut, Louisiana, Oregon, and Washington. 10 Moreover, as shown in Figures 1 and
2, several of these states (New Jersey, New York, and Washington) appeared to be on very
different pre-treatment case and mortality trends than the majority of states, including California.
To test the sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of these 43 states (including the District of
Columbia) in the donor pool, we re-estimate our synthetic control models without eliminating
pre-March 24 SIPO-adopters from the donor pool. Our main findings are largely unchanged (see
column 1 of Appendix Table 2).
One limitation to our preferred donor pool is that by including later-adopting SIPO states
as potential donors, the synthetic control is contaminated on some post-treatment days. Thus, to
the extent that later enacted SIPOs have taken effect, our estimated treatment effects will be
biased towards zero and lower-bound estimates. As one approach to address this concern, we

10

Ohio implemented its statewide SIPO at 11:59pm on March 23, 2020. We code this order as effective on March
24, 2020. However, if we exclude Ohio from our donor pool, we obtain a pattern of results quantitatively similar to
those reported above. Moreover, if we allow all early adopters into our donor pool (see column 1 of Appendix Table
2), the results are also unchanged.

11

select an alternate donor pool that includes states that had never adopted a SIPO or had adopted a
SIPO but had 4 or fewer days of post-treatment data, meaning that likely at least half of all
individuals infected post-SIPO had not yet reached the median incubation period (Lauer et al.
2020). However, this restriction to the donor pool has its own limitation: only 10 states had not
adopted SIPOs by April 9 (Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming), and just 2 were late adopters that fit this
selection criteria (Missouri and South Carolina). 11 Many of these non-adopting and lateadopting states do not share urbanicity, population density, or other policy-related characteristics
of California making them potentially bad donors to the synthetic control group.
Thus, selecting the eligible donor states for the analyses to follow has an inherent
tradeoff. We can select from a broader set of donor states that allow for a better synthetic control
match to California on observables, but partially contaminates our control group with treated
days biasing the estimated policy effect towards zero, or, we can select from a more limited set
of donor states that is uncontaminated by treatment but that may be poorly matched to California
on observables leading to a synthetic control group that is potentially a poor counterfactual for
California. We will present results under both choices. The former approach yields policy
effects that suggest California’s SIPO was effective at slowing the spread of COVID-19 (and is
presented in Tables 1 and 4); the latter approach also yields policy effects that suggest
California’s SIPO was effective (and is presented in columns 2 and 3 of Appendix Table 2), with
results that are larger in magnitude (consistent with the prior approach generating a lower bound
estimate) but also less precise. It is our opinion that a better synthetic control match that yields a

11

Among these states, Massachusetts had issued a “stay at home advisory.”

12

downward biased estimate is more reliable than an estimate from a potentially poorly matched
control group, a point to which we will return below.
With regard to the choice of observables used to select our synthetic control from among
the donor states, we take several approaches. First, an important objective of this research design
is to generate common pre-treatment trends in coronavirus cases (or deaths). Our primary
strategy to achieve this objective is to generate a synthetic control that closely approximates
coronavirus case (and mortality) rates in California in each of seven (7) pre-treatment days
(March 12 through March 18). We also experimented with requiring pre-treatment matches up
to two weeks (14 days) prior to California’s SIPO and our results are unchanged. We estimate
the unobserved counterfactual COVID-19 case rate for California on pre-treatment day 𝑡𝑡 by
∑𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 , where 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 is the weight assigned to donor state 𝑗𝑗. The analogous

counterfactual death rate is ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . The estimated weights 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 are chosen to

minimize the absolute difference between 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖=𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,𝑡𝑡 and ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 and for all

pre-treatment days, as well as the absolute difference between 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖=𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,𝑡𝑡 and

∑𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 . Then, the per-day treatment effect αt is estimated as 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡 = 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖=𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,𝑡𝑡 −
∑𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 ∗ 𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 for t ∈ r [March 19, April 9], where 𝑌𝑌 = [𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷ℎ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅]. The average
treatment effect is then the average over the post-treatment window.

Choosing a counterfactual based only on pre-treatment outcomes has a number of
advantages (Hansen et al. 2020). Given a long enough pre-treatment window, matching on
covariates and matching on outcomes will produce similar results. Choosing not to match on
covariates can eliminate concerns of ‘p-hacking’ and reduce bias of our estimate (Botosaru and
Ferman, 2017). Furthermore, matching on outcomes on pre-treatment days ensures that

13

synthetic CA tracks actual CA not just on the level of the outcome but also on the growth rate of
the outcome in the pre-policy period.
However, a limitation of matching all pre-treatment days to construct synthetic California
is that there may be other observables that may legitimately and strongly influence the path of an
outbreak such as population density, urbanicity, weather, state travel restrictions, or a declaration
of major disaster. As shown by Kaul et.al (2018), matching on all periods of pre-treatment
outcomes renders all covariates irrelevant in the prediction of the outcome.
Thus, we take alternate approaches to generating a synthetic control that allow for these
relevant observables to influence estimation of synthetic weights. First, we generate weights by
matching on coronavirus case (or death) rates on three pre-treatment days (March 13, March 15,
and March 18) as well as state population density and a state urbanicity index. These latter
factors play an important role in the spread of infectious disease across communities due to
increased crowding (Florida 2020). New York City, the most densely populated city in the U.S.,
for example, experienced one of the most dramatic increases in coronavirus outbreaks and has
more coronavirus cases per capita than the nation of Italy (Rosenthal 2020).
Second, we generate synthetic weights using March 13, March 15, and March 18
coronavirus case (or death) rates and several state policies designed to affect the outbreak:
whether an emergency major disaster declaration was in effect for the state and whether the state
had imposed travel restrictions (i.e. guidelines for residents and/or visitors to quarantine
themselves for two weeks following arrival from other states).
Third, we consider the role of state COVID-19 testing rates. One reason why we might
see changes in cases is because testing resources have changed. As of March 13, only 15,000
tests had been conducted in the U.S. To address the low testing rate in the U.S., the Food and

14

Drug Administration approved a new COVID-19 test from the pharmaceutical company Roche
(Arnold 2020). In the following days, states including Delaware, New York, Massachusetts and
Texas, began implementing drive-up testing sites, which made access to testing more available
(Yancey-Bragg 2020). Despite these improvements in accessibility, many testing delays
persisted due to laboratory capacity constraints (Brown and Court 2020). Coronavirus-related
deaths are less likely to be affected by this selection into testing. Nevertheless, we take two
approaches to explore the issue of testing capacity. For our first approach, we explore if
California’s SIPO affected testing rates, using synthetic control methods described and the
number of tests as the outcome variable. For our second approach, we return to our main
analysis of case (and death) rates and generate a synthetic California using March 13, 15 and 18
pre-treatment case (and death) rates as well as the average rate of testing per 100,000 population.
To conduct hypothesis tests, we take two approaches. First, we conduct placebo tests
following the method suggested by Abadie et al. (2010). We apply the same synthetic control
method described above for each donor state. For donor state j, we reclassify the state as a
treatment state, and select a donor pool based on all donor states except j, and add California to
the donor pool. We then use the same matching criteria stated above to generate a synthetic
control 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 for each donor state j as if treatment were assigned March 19.

We compare the pre-treatment and post-treatment mean squared prediction error (MSPE)

for each state, calculating the MSPE ratio as follows:
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑗𝑗 =

2
∑𝑇𝑇
𝑡𝑡=3/19(𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 −𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )
3/18

∑𝑡𝑡=3/12(𝑌𝑌𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 −𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 )2

(1)

The MSPE measures a relative goodness of fit for each state’s synthetic control based on
estimated coronavirus cases (or deaths). A high MSPE ratio can be interpreted as poor posttreatment fit relative to pre-treatment fit. The ranking of the treated states relative to the placebo
15

states then provides a permutation-based p-value. The p-value relies directly on the number of
states in the donor pool. With 43 states in the donor pool, California’s MSPE ratio must rank at
least 2nd to receive a p-value below .05 and at least 4th to receive a p-value below .1. A p-value
of less than .01 is not attainable given the number of donor states.12
The p-value generated for the “standard” synthetic control model generates information
on post-treatment fit based on the entire post-treatment period following the March 19 California
order. However, there are some important reasons why we might want to calculate MSPE over
particular post-treatment windows. For example, differences in the California “gap” (the
difference between California’s coronavirus rate and synthetic California’s coronavirus rate) is
expected to be much smaller during the incubation period (median of 5.1 days, 97.5th percentile
of 11.5 days) following the SIPO relative to the post-incubation period when symptoms would
have been present and infectious disease transmission more efficient. Moreover, given that the
effects of social distancing may have important multiplier effects over time (Florida 2020), we
could expect the “gap” to increase exponentially following treatment. For these reasons, we
provide a range of permutation p-values based on several post-treatment windows: (i) the entire
post-treatment period, (ii) the post-SIPO period after the median incubation length (March 24
and later), and (iii) the post-SIPO period after which 97.5 percent of those infected on the SIPO
implementation date are expected to experience symptoms (March 30 and later).
Second, we conduct statistical inference by estimating wild bootstrap cluster standard
errors (Cameron et al. 2008; Cameron and Miller 2015) using difference-in-differences

12

The null hypothesis utilizing these p-values is that there is no effect in each period, not that the average policy
effect is zero. It is possible to have a policy effect with an average of zero in the post-treatment period, but a large
MSPE if the effect of the policy changes sign in the post-period. For this reason, it is important to make judgements
based on both the MSPE and the general pattern of results. See Powell (2018).

regressions. We draw data from California and donor states that received positive synthetic
weights in the construction of synthetic California and estimate a difference-in-differences model
of the following form:

ln (Case Rateit) = β0 + β1SIPOit + β2Xit + γs + τt + μit

(2)

where SIPOit is an indicator for the day that California adopts a shelter-in-place order, Xit is a set
of state-level, day-varying controls that include indicators for whether the state enacted a
statewide non-essential business closure order (that falls short of a shelter-in-place order),
whether the state enacted a targeted shelter-in-place order that covers only older individuals over
age 65 or those with underlying health conditions, whether the state had enacted travel-related
restrictions, whether a major disaster declaration had been issued for the state, the average
temperature (in degrees Celsius) at all weather stations in the state, and an indicator for whether
any weather station in the state reported measurable precipitation. In addition, we control for
state fixed effects (γs) and day fixed effects (τt), identifying our treatment effect (β1) via withinstate variation in the enactment of a SIPO. We also estimate equation (2) where we replace Case
Rateit with Death Rateit, but given low counts of deaths during the earlier days of our analysis
period, we experiment with count data models such as Poisson and negative binomial models.
We first estimate equation (2) using an unweighted linear regression, giving equal weight
to California and each positively synthetically-weighted donor state. Then, we use the synthetic
weights (between 0 and 1) generated from the synthetic control model to weight each state and
then assign California a weight of 1. In all cases, to conduct statistical inference, we generate

17

standard errors via wild cluster bootstrapping given the small number of clusters (states), which
includes a single treatment state (Cameron et al. 2008; Cameron and Miller 2015).

4. Results
Our main findings on the effects of California’s statewide SIPO can be found in Figures 4
through 18 and Tables 1 through 6. Discussion of county-specific COVID-19 SIPOs are
discussed in Section 4.4 and in Tables 7 and 8.

4.1 “Stay at home” Behavior and California Statewide SIPO
Figure 4 presents trends in the shelter-in-place index for both California and its synthetic
control. The index reflects the percent of the population in a given state that stays at home all
day relative to a baseline, derived from anonymized cell phone geotagging (SafeGraph, Inc.).
We assign weights to the synthetic control based on close matches in the shelter-in-place index
for each of the 7 days prior to CA’s statewide SIPO. 13 Trends in social distancing are expectedly
positive over the entire analysis period as awareness of COVID-19 was proliferating and the
benefits of social distancing were emphasized through public health advisories and guidelines.
The synthetically-generated counterfactual tracks California nearly identically prior to the SIPO,
with trends markedly diverging only after California issued its statewide order on March 19.
Estimates of the average daily treatment effect indicate that the percent of individuals remaining
at home throughout the day increased by 2.1 percentage-points in California relative to its
synthetic control, over the entire post-SIPO period. The effect is larger over the initial post-

13

As the baseline for the index is the same for all states (week ending February 12, 2020), and the pre-SIPO trends
are nearly identical, the treatment effect can be interpreted as the increase in the percent of households in CA who
are staying at home relative to its counterfactual in the post-SIPO period.

18

treatment window up to March 28, indicating a 3.3 percentage-point increase in the average daily
rate at which individuals shelter at home in California relative to the synthetic control, and
suggestive of a rapid run-up in social distancing. Focusing on this window wherein CA
experienced the largest gains in social distancing, the effect is statistically significant with a onesided permutation-based p-value of 0.023. As more donor states issued their own shelter-inplace orders, notably by the end of March, and gains for California decelerated, trends narrowed
somewhat between California and its synthetic control.
These analyses underscore two points. First, they provide some supporting evidence that
individuals in California complied with the shelter-in-place order, and that the SIPO effectively
and rapidly reduced social mobility in California, an effect which was sustained over the analysis
period. Second, as pressure for social distancing intensified, the health effects that we estimate
below capture the direct effect of California’s SIPO on contagion by forcing certain forms of
economic activity to stop as well as the compounding effects of the SIPO accelerating social
distancing behavior during the early period of the coronavirus outbreak cycle.

4.2 COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and California Statewide SIPO
Figure 5a shows trends in California’s confirmed COVID-19 cumulative cases from
March 12, 2020 through April 20, 2020. Case rates rose fairly linearly over the period from
March 12 through March 25 from .6 to 8 per 100,000 population before beginning more
exponential growth, reaching 85.6 per 100,000 on April 20, 2020.
Our first synthetic control assigns weights based on close matches in pre-SIPO case rates
on each of the 7 pre-treatment days. We find that a total of 10 states contributed approximately
two-thirds of the weight for the estimated counterfactual. These include Colorado, the District of

19

Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Rhode Island and
South Dakota (Figure 5b). 14 This estimated synthetic control serves as our counterfactual for
coronavirus case trends that would have unfolded in California in the absence of the SIPO
enactment. Figure 5a shows that COVID-19 case rate trends in California and synthetic
California are nearly identical in the pre-March 19 period. During the first three (3) days
following treatment, which capture the first half of the coronavirus incubation period,
coronavirus case rates remain quite similar in California and the synthetic control state.
However, beginning on March 23 and accelerating after March 25, the rate of growth in
California’s coronavirus cases was substantially lower in California relative to the synthetic
control. By the final day of case data in our analysis (April 20), we find that there were 125.5
fewer coronavirus cases per 100,000 population, which translates to 49,636 fewer total cases on
that day. This pattern of findings suggests that the public health benefits of the SIPO grew over
the near-month long period of analysis. These public health benefits also capture any potential
compounding effects due to California responding early during the initial phase of its outbreak
cycle. 15
In column (1) of Table 1, we show estimates of the average daily treatment effect for the
full post-SIPO period from March 19 through April 20 (Panel I), for the post-treatment period
beginning March 23, which accounts for the median coronavirus incubation period (Panel II),
and for the post-SIPO period beginning March 30, the 97th percentile of the coronavirus
incubation period (Panel III). For the full post-treatment period, we estimate that the enactment

14
The highest synthetic weights were assigned to Colorado (11%), the District of Columbia (3%), Maine (10%),
Massachusetts (15%), and South Dakota (18%).
15
If we employ the synthetic weights from Model 1 (Table 1) to compute a weighted average date of SIPO
enactment among the states in the control group and assign never adopters a pseudo-treatment date that is one day
after the end of the analysis period, then, using this measure, California issued its SIPO on average 13 days prior to
synthetic California.

20

of the SIPO is associated with a 42.02 decline in average coronavirus cases per 100,000
population. Over the near month-long window, this suggests approximately 49,636 COVID-19
cases averted. 16
The daily decline in coronavirus cases is not constant over the post-treatment window.
The estimated public health benefits accelerate in the days following enactment, consistent with
an exponential growth in contagion that was averted from the SIPO’s enactment. Following
March 22, the enactment of the SIPO led to a 47.7 decline in average coronavirus cases per
100,000 population while in the post-March 30 period, the average cumulative case reduction
that we attribute to California’s SIPO is 61.0 per 100,000 population. Together, this evidence is
consistent with the hypothesis that the public health benefits of California’s SIPO grew
exponentially in the short-run.
To conduct statistical inference of the above estimates, we turn to permutation-based pvalue calculations. In Figure 5c, we show results from our placebo tests, which give rise to the
rank-based p-values we generate. In each case, the permutation-based p-value was .045 using
the standard ranking generated by the pre-post MSPE ratio, and .045 using a one-tailed pre-post
MSPE ratio test.
An important concern in synthetic control analysis is how robust findings are to the
choice of observable controls and donor states. Figure 6a shows results from a synthetic control
approach where we only assure pre-treatment matches on COVID-19 cases on three days (March
13, March 15, and March 18), but also augment our matching strategy by assuring similarity on
the share of the state population residing in urban areas. According to the 2010 Census, 95.0

16

To take a more conservative approach, we also consider an alternate strategy where we force coronavirus cases
during the period from March 19 through March 23 to be comparable to the donor states. This imposes a null effect
of the SIPO on cases due to lagged effect from exposure to symptoms during the incubation period. This exercise,
shown in Appendix Figure 4, yields similar results as our main model.

21

percent of the population lived in urbanized areas or urban clusters. In Appendix Table 3, we
compare urbanicity rates in California (column 1) with all other states (column 2), and synthetic
California (column 3). We find that urbanicity rates are most similar to California with the
synthetic counterfactual.
Despite generating a very different set of positively weighted donor states from the
approach undertaken in Figure 5a, the estimated treatment effect is quite similar, as is the pretreatment match. 17 There is a tight pre-treatment fit, with an exponential divergence following
the post-SIPO initial virus incubation period. In column (2) of Table 1, we show that over the
full post-treatment period, the California SIPO led to a 56.3 per 100,000 population decline in
average cumulative coronavirus cases. Again, the effect sizes were larger in later days of the
post-treatment period (Panels II and III), consistent with exponential growth in public health
benefits to those in California. The permutation-based p-value from placebo tests (Figure 6c)
is .023 in all panels.
Given that urbanicity rates may not fully capture the degree of crowding, in Figures 7a
through 7c, we show results from a synthetic control model where we match not only on
urbanicity, but also population density, increasing the likelihood that we more heavily weight
those donor states with higher risk of coronavirus contagion. 18 Our findings, shown in Figures
7a-7c and in column (3) of Table 1, are quite similar to those in column (2) of Table 1.
To ensure that coronavirus testing is not biasing estimates of the effect of California’s
SIPO on confirmed cases, we next select weights for donor states by also matching on the

17

In Appendix Table 4, we show synthetic control estimates where we limit the donor states to the continental
United States, thus eliminating Alaska and Hawaii as potential donors. The pattern of results is qualitatively similar
to that shown in Table 2.
18
Appendix Table 3 shows the quality of the synthetic control on these observables.

22

average rate of testing over the sample period. 19 The results in Appendix Figures 2a through 2c
provide some support for the hypothesis that testing for the coronavirus may have increased in
the short-term following the SIPO, suggesting that estimated case reductions may be biased
toward zero. Though, after about two weeks following CA’s SIPO, testing rates in the control
group increased more rapidly relative to CA. After controlling for average coronavirus testing
rates, we find that the California SIPO led to an average reduction of 61.6 COVID-19 cases per
100,000 population. By April 20, we estimate 68,157 COVID-19 cases averted (Figures 8a-8c
and column 4 of Table 1).
In column (5), we explore whether our estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the
addition of COVID-19-related policy controls, including major disaster declarations and state
travel restrictions (see Appendix Table 3). The pattern of results shown in Figures 9a through 9c
are quite similar to those shown in the previous figures. We find that the California SIPO led to
an average 59.4 case per 100,000 population reduction in COVID-19 cases. By April 20, the
cumulative number of coronavirus cases averted was approximately 66,020 (based on column 5
of Table 1).
One important question about our prior analyses is whether we are identifying the effect
of a SIPO or just voluntary social distancing that is correlated with the adoption of a SIPO and
with coronavirus cases. In column (6) of Table 1, we match on pre-treatment growth in rates of
staying-at-home using SafeGraph data as well as three days of pre-treatment coronavirus cases.
Here, we estimate that over the near-month long pretreatment period, California’s SIPO was
associated with a nearly 87,000 decline in the total number of COVID-19 cases. Figures 10a-10c
show these results.

19

Appendix Table 3 shows means of testing rates for California and its synthetic control.

23

Could our donor states be too different from synthetic California in experiencing
community spread of the coronavirus? Different states experienced coronavirus outbreak at
different times. In the pre-treatment period, California had experienced nearly 252 cases of
COVID-19 on March 12, which suggests that outbreak and community spread was well
underway. To ensure that the donor pool for synthetic California had also experienced
community spread, in Table 2, we limit our donor pool to states that had experienced at least 10
(column 1), 50 (column 2), or 100 cases (column 3) of coronavirus. The results in Table 2 and
Figure 11 continue to show strong evidence that California’s SIPO was associated with a
reduction in COVID-19 cases.
It is important to recall that each of the above estimates is based on a synthetic control
from a set of donor states that are partially treated in the latter part of the post-period, and as such
are a lower bound for the true effect of the policy. 20 In columns (2) and (3) of Appendix Table 2,
we examine the sensitivity of estimated policy impacts to the use of never-adopting or lateradopting (after April 5) states as controls. We find that California’s statewide SIPO reduced
average cumulative case rates by about 66 cases per 100,000 relative to synthetic California.
These results are larger in magnitude, but also less precise than the estimates when we allow
partially treated states in the control group.
Appendix Figure 7 presents the corresponding trends in cumulative cases for California
and synthetic California. While these results are validating, we note here the qualification that
the set of donor states that receive positive weights among non-adopters include Massachusetts

20

In Appendix Figures 5 and 6, we trim the post-treatment window in order to limit the effects of later SIPOs
enacted by states within the synthetic control. Specifically, Appendix Figure 5 trims the post-treatment period to
March 28, which is 5 days (median incubation period) after the first treatment date for any donor state, ensuring that
the trend in cases exhibited by synthetic CA is not due to a SIPO enacted within the control group. Appendix Figure
6 slightly extends the post-treatment period to April 3, ensuring that the window ends before the median incubation
period plus lag to ARDS (13 days). Both figures show consistent evidence that the statewide SIPO in CA flattened
its outbreak trajectory and reduced the average daily COVID-19 cases.

24

(38 percent), Oklahoma (22.4 percent), Utah (22.3 percent), North Dakota (14 percent), and
Wyoming (3.2 percent). Appendix Table 5 shows that the synthetic California estimated from
never adopters (columns 2 and 3) and never or late adopters (columns 4 and 5) differ on
population density and urbanicity. Given the important role of social interactions in the spread of
the coronavirus, this makes it possible that the synthetic California generated from a much
narrow set of never (or later) adopting donor states were on a different longer-run coronavirus
contagion trend, and thus may serve as a poor counterfactual for California. 21
Table 3 presents difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of California’s SIPO on
the natural log of confirmed COVID-19 cases. In each case, the sample is comprised of
California and each donor state that received a positive weight in the synthetic control exercise
described by each column, which follows the set of tests from Table 3. Panel I shows estimates
from unweighted regressions, while Panel II uses synthetic weights (which sum to 1) for the
donor states and a weight of 1.0 for California. All models include the full set of controls
described below equation (2) above. Standard errors are generated via wild cluster (state)
bootstrap.
Our findings provide consistent evidence that the California SIPO had substantial
negative effects on coronavirus cases. Unweighted estimates in Panel I show that the enactment
of California’s SIPO was associated with a 50.3 to 59.0 percent decline in the coronavirus rate.
When we weight using synthetic weights (Panel II), the effect sizes range from approximately
35.5 to 54.1 percent declines. 22

21

This may also help explain why the estimated effects for deaths in Panel II of Appendix Table 2 are weak and do
not attain statistical significance at conventional levels. The longer lag from infection to incubation to ARDS limits
the quality of the synthetic control match when drawing from the smaller pool of never or late adopters.
22
Given that the outcome is the log of the caseload, the percent decline for model 1 is [e-0.609- 1]*100 = 45.6%.

25

In Panel III of Table 3, we focus on regressions weighted by synthetic weights and
decompose the average treatment effect based on the approximate interquartile range of the
incubation window following enactment of the SIPO. Consistent with the synthetic control
estimates, we find that the effectiveness of the SIPO grows larger following the virus’s
incubation period and the period from time until first symptom until respiratory failure.
Together, the findings in Tables 1 through 3 provide compelling evidence that
California’s first-in-the-nation SIPO generated important public health benefits in preventing the
spread of the coronavirus during the first three weeks of enactment.23 Next, we explore whether
these case declines generated improvements in mortality rates.

4.3 COVID-19 Deaths and California Statewide SIPO
In Figures 12a through 12c, we show estimates of the effect of California’s SIPO on
coronavirus-related mortality. Figure 12a shows the exponential rise in cumulative COVID-19related deaths in California, from 0.01 per 100,000 population (4 deaths) on March 12 to 3.09 per
100,000 population (1,223 deaths) on April 20. When we generate a synthetic control using all
pre-treatment days to generate matches on COVID-related mortality rates, we find strong
evidence of a pre-March 19 common trend for California and synthetic California. On March
25, 6 days following enactment of the SIPO, we find that the rate of increase in mortality begins
falling in California as compared to the estimated counterfactual, with a gap that widens

23

In Appendix Figures 3a through 3c, we show synthetic control results when we use daily case rates rather than
cumulative case rates. This isolates a different local average treatment effect; that is, the effect of a SIPO on the rate
of change in the change in cumulative coronavirus cases. Furthermore, this exercise explicitly matches on the daily
growth in COVID-19 cases in all of the pre-SIPO periods. By doing so, we are also implicitly matching on the
second derivative of the cumulative case rate function, which is the growth in the daily change or the acceleration in
the growth in daily case rates. Daily case rate data are more noisy, but the results continue to provide evidence that
California’s SIPO reduced coronavirus-related mortality.

26

exponentially over time, getting particularly large nearly two weeks after the policy’s adoption
on March 31, 2020.
This longer lagged effect on mortality relative to cases is to be expected given the
incubation period from exposure to symptoms and time from first symptoms to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), the latter of which may take up to 8 days (Wang et al. 2020).
Moreover, a more conservative synthetic control approach, shown in Appendix Figures 8a
through 8c, which requires pre-treatment mortality rate matches for every period through the sum
of the median incubation length (5.1 days) and the median symptoms-until-near-death (8.0 days),
shows a sharp relative decline in coronavirus-related mortality rates in California. 24 Finally, we
note that there are channels through which mortality may be affected by SIPOs that are not
directly affected by exposure to contagious infected patients. SIPOs may affect the likelihood
that previously infected patients seek medical care due to beliefs about contagion at medical
facilities. SIPOs may also impact the availability of resources for medical care, including
testing, as public resources are used to enforce SIPOs.
Our estimates in column (1) of Table 4 show that California’s SIPO led to an average
decline in the coronavirus death rate of approximately 1.4 per 100,000. By April 20, there were
763 fewer COVID-19 deaths. Combined with the estimated case effect shown in column (1) of
Table 4, our estimated mortality effect implies a coronavirus-related mortality rate of 3.3 percent,
somewhat high, but within the range of mortality estimates suggested by the WHO and CDC
(World Health Organization 2020f; Wilson et al. 2020). Of course, there are a number of caveats
to this back-of-the-envelope assessment to judge the credibility of our estimates. First, deaths

24

Because death rates during the early phase of the outbreak were low for all states, and 0 for a few states during the
first few days, we present alternate synthetic control estimates for deaths by matching on COVID-19 cases on all
pre-treatment days (see Appendix Figure 9). Estimated effects for mortality rates are not sensitive to matching on
case rates, and continue to indicate a marked reduction in deaths in CA relative to the control group.

27

occur with a lag with respect to confirmed cases. Second, during the earlier stages of the
outbreak, there is evidence that state medical resource constraints permitted testing of only those
with more severe symptoms and a higher probability of succumbing to their illness (Baker and
Fink 2020). Third, this implied mortality rate is based on the margin of cases averted due to the
SIPO, which may be different than the average infected case. 25
While our estimated mortality decline is substantial in magnitude, permutation-based pvalues are insufficiently small to conclude definitively that there is a death decline due to
California’s SIPO. As expected, the size of the death reduction induced by the state SIPO grows
much larger when the incubation period and time from symptoms until possible death are
excluded from the analysis. We estimate effect sizes that range from –1.59 to (Table 4, column
1, Panel II) to –2.05 (Table 4, column 1, Panel III) per 100,000 population per day.
The remaining columns of Table 4 show the estimated effect of California’s SIPO when
using the same observables to generate the weights for synthetic California described in columns
(2) through (6) of Table 1. 26 Figures 13 through 17 show the corresponding synthetic control
graphs. Across specifications, we find evidence that the California SIPO is negatively related to
the coronavirus mortality rate, though the magnitude of the effect is somewhat smaller after
controlling for observables related to public policies in testing. However, the estimated
treatment effect grows later in the treatment window and is largest following March 30, when we
expect lagged effects on mortality due to reaching the sum of the median incubation period and
median time until ARDS. Somewhat smaller mortality declines are observed in specifications
that also match on average testing rates.

In other words, the implied mortality rate is based on (∆ Death Rate / ∆ Case Rate) and may be different than the
average mortality rate (Total Death Rate / Total Case Rate).
26
These estimates imply a marginal coronavirus-related mortality rate of 0.8% to 2.5%.
25

28

In Table 5 and in Figure 18, we examine whether the estimated mortality effects we
observe are sensitive to requiring donor states to have experienced community spread. The
findings suggest that we obtain comparable estimated lives saved as those reported in Table 4.
Specifically, we estimate that the adoption of a SIPO is associated with 763 to 1,661 fewer
deaths, with a median estimate around 1,500 lives saved.
Finally, in Table 6, we present difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of
California’s SIPO on COVID-19-related mortality. All models are weighted using the synthetic
weights generated in the four main models we have considered. Panel I shows our findings on
the average treatment effect in the post-treatment period, while Panel II decomposes the
treatment effect into the early period when death effects should be relatively small (time from
incubation until ARDS) and the latter period accounting for this lag. We find evidence that the
mortality declines from the implementation of the SIPO are generally larger in the period
following March 30, as expected. However, uniformly, estimates are fairly imprecise, in part
owed to low COVID-19 mortality rates in the state. During this period, we find the SIPOs
reduce COVID-related mortality by between 12.5 to 17.5 percent per day.
Given low counts of deaths, in Panels III and IV of Table 6, we present estimates from
Poisson models. We find much stronger evidence of negative impacts of California’s SIPO on
mortality. In the post-incubation-until-ARDS period (Panel IV), we find consistent evidence that
the SIPO was associated with a 46.2 to 73.7 percent decline in deaths. 27

27

Given the possibility of overdispersion in deaths, we also estimated these count models via negative binomial
regression. While computationally more intensive, we find estimated SIPO effects that are qualitatively similar. For
example, in column (1) of Panel III, we find that that the SIPO was associated with a 51 percent decline in deaths.
This compares to an identical decline using a negative binomial model.

29

Taken together, the results from Tables 4 through 6 provide strong evidence that
California’s SIPO generated substantial short-run public health benefits via reduced coronavirusrelated mortality.

4.4 California County-Level Analysis
Prior to the adoption of California’s statewide SIPO, 12 counties and the cities of Los
Angeles and Berkeley adopted local SIPOs. Appendix Table 6 lists these jurisdictions and their
dates of enactment. If early SIPO adoption in the midst of an exponential expanding epidemic,
particularly in high population density localities, can generate large public health benefits, these
early adopting jurisdictions may have seen earlier and more pronounced declines in COVID-19
cases.
In Table 7, we provide descriptive evidence that this may be the case. In columns (1) and
(2), we provide evidence on pre-treatment county-level coronavirus case and death rates. We
find that coronavirus rates were much higher in early adopting SIPO counties (ESIPOs).
However, we see that growth in coronavirus cases was substantially lower in ESIPO counties as
compared to those who were bound by the statewide policy. Between March 5 and April 20, the
coronavirus case rate increases by over 42 times in ESIPO counties, but well over 316 times in
those who adopted SIPOs later. Due to many low population counties with zero deaths for much
of the sample period it is difficult to draw reliable inference with regards to county-level SIPOs
and mortality.
Synthetic control estimates in Table 8 on ESIPO counties, which match on pre-treatment
coronavirus case rates in ESIPO and non-ESIPO counties do not, in the main, suggest a
significant divergence in trends in these outcomes, either in the earlier period following

30

enactment or over time. Only for the county of Santa Cruz is there some evidence that cases fell
more than in its synthetic counterfactual, generated from other California counties. However, we
note an important caveat with our county-specific findings. Appendix Figure 10 shows that
many California counties did not have particularly strong pre-treatment matches on coronavirus
cases. Many ESIPO counties were already trending upward in coronavirus cases prior to the
adoption of an ESIPO relative to other counties. Furthermore, the cross-county analyses are
challenged by the close proximity of the SIPOs among the early adopting counties with the
statewide order, with all of these orders occurring within a span less than the median incubation
period of the coronavirus, making it difficult to identify potentially small differences in the posttreatment trends. Thus, we are hesitant to draw any strong conclusions about the effectiveness of
CA’s early adopters using within-state comparison counties as donors. 28

5. Conclusions
On March 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom implemented the nation’s most
radical response to a worldwide coronavirus outbreak: implementing a statewide shelter-in-place
order that required citizens to remain inside their dwellings for all but activities deemed
“essential,” such as grocery shopping, pharmaceutical pick-up, caring for sick relatives and
friends, or employment deemed essential. This policy was designed to slow the spread of the
coronavirus by enforcing social distancing through legal force and social pressure. The high level
of urbanicity in California, combined with policy adoption during a period of slow coronavirus
cases, make this state a unique case study of early precautionary policies in a high-risk
environment.

28

This pattern of findings did not change when we attempted to generate synthetic county controls based on withinCalifornia county-specific matches on urbanicity and population density.

31

This study is the first to rigorously examine the short-run impact of California’s SIPO on
the rate of confirmed COVID-19 infections and COVID-19-related mortality. Using a synthetic
control approach, we estimate that in the near-month following the order, the state SIPO reduced
the number of COVID-19 cases by 125.5 to 219.7 per 100,000 population. In addition, our
synthetic control estimates suggest that the California SIPO averted up to 1,661 COVID-19related deaths. Thus, our estimates suggest a mortality rate of about one to three percent at the
margin of averted cases. We note that these benefits represent the effects of having a SIPO in
place as well as the effects of doing so early in the outbreak cycle. Notably, the synthetic control
issued a SIPO later in the outbreak cycle, about 13 days on average following California. Hence,
the treatment effects for CA also capture the potential benefits of an early response.
These findings are robust to the choice of observables with which we weight potential
donor states. Moreover, lagged case and mortality effects are consistent with the median
incubation period of COVID-19 as well as estimates of time from first symptoms until acute
respiratory distress syndrome. We find little evidence that changes in testing for coronavirus
leads to substantial bias in our estimates. Finally, turning to county-level data, we find little
evidence that counties that adopted SIPOs prior to California’s statewide SIPO law saw earlier
and more pronounced declines in coronavirus cases than their later adopting California
counterparts, though this may be due to the relatively short span of time (4 days) between when
the early adopters enacted the shelter-in-place order and the statewide order.
The statewide results we present show substantial short-run public health benefits of
California’s SIPO. But we also note that there were substantial economic costs of this
intervention. In addition to substantial utility losses caused by social distancing from nonhousehold members (Hamermesh 2020), the SIPO was accompanied by substantial job loss.

32

Unemployment insurance claims in California rose by 2.83 million in the four weeks during
which we studied mortality reductions (U.S. Department of Labor 2020). If we net out the
average increase in the weekly jobless claim rate of our preferred “synthetic California” for
COVID-19 cases (column 1 of Table 1) as a proxy for how weekly job loss would have evolved
in California, estimates of job loss are nearly 75 percent smaller, a finding consistent with new
work by Baek et al. 2020). Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest, at the lower bound, over
400 jobs were lost per COVID-19 death averted.29,30
Some of the aforementioned job losses may be short-term to the extent that they are due
to a temporary decrease in aggregate demand and consumer spending which may rebound once
the SIPO is lifted and the risk of infection weakened. Further, government spending packages
such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which is designed to
infuse firms with public funds to remain open until SIPOs were lifted may blunt the total job loss
impact (although the long run impact of the bill, which cost over $2 trillion, on future public and
private finances is difficult to predict). Finally, we note that the vast majority of deaths averted
from coronavirus are among the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (Wu and
McGoogan 2020; Verity et al. 2020; CDC Covid-19 Response Team 2020). Thus, the SIPO
represents a substantial intergenerational redistribution of resources toward the older and
infirmed.

29

We note, however, that the dynamics of job loss following SIPOs may be quite different from coronavirus cases.
For example, if job losses following the implementation of a SIPO occurs sooner than coronavirus cases or deaths
are averted, synthetic California is likely to be more contaminated from donor states than coronavirus cases averted
(due to the lack of an incubation or time from symptoms-until-ARDS lag). If this is the case, then the jobs per case
averted (or life saved) reported above will be understated.
30
Appendix Figure 11 shows a synthetic control estimate using weekly jobless claims data from the U.S.
Department of Labor through April 11. The outcome represents the rate of weekly jobless claims relative to covered
jobs in the state. We generate synthetic California using the same weights used for our coronavirus case synthetic
control using pre-treatment COVID-19 case matches.

33

There are several dimensions in which future work will be important. First, in the
absence of a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19 in the short term, the chief public
health rationale for temporary shutdown orders is to reduce serious COVID-19-related illnesses
and deaths due to short-run medical capacity constraints (Greenstone and Nigam 2020). If some
of the deaths or illnesses are postponed to the future when the SIPO is lifted, the intervention’s
net health benefits will be smaller. Second, California was uniquely positioned to reap important
short-run health benefits from its SIPO given the state’s high urbanicity rate and the enactment
of the SIPO during a period of very low COVID-19 case growth. Other jurisdictions with less
crowding, less medical preparedness, or higher rates of pre-SIPO COVID-19 case growth may
have very different experiences.

Figure 4: Synthetic Control Estimates for Shelter-in-Place Index
[Matching Variables: Shelter-in-Place Index on All Pre-Treatment Days]

Notes: Estimate is generated using synthetic control methods. The matching was based on seven days of the preSIPO shelter-in-place index. Synthetic California is comprised of DC (.666) and MA (.333). P-values are computed
using permutation test. Two-sided p-value is .95 and one-sided p-value is .53. However, the p-value generated
from a one-sided test of an examination of the March 19 through March 28 is .02.

Notes: Regressions include California and each donor state that included positive weights greater than 0.005. All estimates include: an indicator for a non-essential business
closure order or a targeted SIPO in a given state-day, indicator for whether a state has issued a travel ban, indicator for whether a state declared a disaster emergency, indicator
for any precipitation, average temperature, average precipitation, state and day fixed effects. Confidence intervals, created using standard errors generated from wild cluster
bootstrapping, are reported in brackets. aPoisson estimates use state population as exposure variable.
