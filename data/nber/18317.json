    "abstract": "\n\nHow and by how much do supervisors enhance worker productivity?  Using a company-based data set on the productivity of technology-based services workers, supervisor effects are estimated and found to be large.  Replacing a boss who is in the lower 10% of boss quality with one who is in the upper 10% of boss quality increases a team's total output by more than  would adding one worker to a nine member team. Workers assigned to better bosses are less likely to leave the firm. A separate normalization implies that the average boss is about 1.75 times as productive as the average worker.\n\n",
