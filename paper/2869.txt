DYNAMIC SEIGNIORAGE THEORY: AN EXPLORATION

ABS TRACT

This paper shows that the optimal extraction of seigniorage
implies a strong tendency for inflation to fall over time toward
its socially optimal level. The point is made using a multi-period

model in which (i) the government can finance deficits through
bond issue or money creation,

(ii) private-sector expectations are

rational, and (iii) the government sets the inflation rate each
period in a discretionary manner. One way to view the model i as
a synthesis of the "tax-smoothing"

theory of government deficits,

which predicts that the inflation tax follows approximately a
martingale, and of models of discretionary

policy making, which

predict (absent reputation effects) that inflation is likely to
exceed its socially optimal level. Both predictions are modified

when the two approaches to

explaining inflation are merged.

Reputation effects play no role in the analysis.

Introduction

High inflation can arise when the seigniorage derived from

money creation plays a prominent role in the public finances.
Economic research of the l950s and 1960s elucidated the allocative
effects of steady-state, fully anticipated inflation- - the resource

transfer to the government and the associated welfare loss of
consumers. More

recent work has aimed to explain observed

inflation rates, and has proceeded along two main lines. The first

of these focuses on the temptation to effect the resource transfer

more efficiently through surprise inflation. The second adds a
dynamic dimension to the problem, exploring official incentives to

issue debt so as to spread over time the distortionary burden of
the inflation tax

It is convenient to call the first approach to

explaining inflation the discretionary-policy approach,

the

second the tax-smoothing approach.

Calvo (1978a,b), Barro (1983), and others have observed that

when policy is made on a discretionary, period-by-period basis,
the lure of surprise price-level movements may, in equilibrium,
lead to higher inflation and lower revenue than would result if

the goverrunent could bind itself to a

prior choice of the

inflation rate. The incentive to violate such a commitment

in

later periods is an example of the general problem of time
inconsistency: optimal government plans that affect private
choices may no longer appear optimal after the private sector has
made those choices.'

'See Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (l978a,b). Seigniorage
is not, of course, the only mechanism through which government
1

While

the discretionary-policy approach

predicts

that

inflation will be higher than is socially optimal (absent possible

reputation effects), the tax-smoothing approach implies that
inflation, whatever its level today, will be persistent. Barro
(1979) suggested that an intertemporally maximizing

government

with exogenous spending needs would find it optimal to formulate

contingency plans for taxes that equate over all future periods

the expected marginal loss due to tax distortions.

This

"permanent-income" view of tax-setting behavior has been extended

to the inflation tax by Mankiw (1987), Grilli (1988a,b), and
others, who argue that, at least as an approximation, a country's

inflation rate should follow a martingale if seigniorage is the
main force driving inflation.

A look at some data gives cause for skepticism about both

views of inflation- -at least in the simple forms paraphrased
above. Chart 1 shows the time series of annual inflation rates in

the United Kingdom and the United States between 1871 and 1986.2
In both countries, inflation shows occasional sharp upward spikes

(for example, during the two world wars), but there is no clear

credibility problems may cause suboptimally high inflation
(although it has been a key mechanism at some time in many
countries). Some studies, for example, Kydland and Prescott (1977)
and Barro and Gordon (1983), focus instead on attempts to exploit
short-run
tradeoffs
between
inflation
and
unanticipated
employment.

2A number of au.thors have made the point that fairly long time

series might be needed to detect the mean-reverting behavior
tested for below. Given this need, it seems best to use data from

countries, like the U.K. and the U.S., which have maintained
stable political institutions over a long sample period. Vittorto
Grilli generously provided the data plotted in chart 1.

evidence of persistently high inflation. Indeed, when examined
over a long time period, inflation apparently has a tendency to
revert to a fairly low mean level.

These visual impressions are confirmed by the more formal
econometric tests reported in table 1. For both countries, the

favored univariate statistical model

for

inflation

is

a

first-order autoregression with an autoregressive coefficent a

that is positive, but well below unity.

[The Dickey-Fuller

criterion rejects decisively the hypothesis of a random walk (a
1.) in favor of a stationary alternative.] The implied steady-state

annual inflation rate for the U.K. is 3.5 percent; that for the
U.S. is 2.2 percent.3

Does a tendency for inflation to revert to a low level imply

that discretionary policy-making and tax smoothing should be
rejected as elements in a positive theory of inflation taxation?

In this paper, I argue, to the contrary, that both concepts are

central to understanding the dynamic behavior of seigniorage
revenue and inflation. Existing models stressing the potential
3Mankiw (198]) finds that 1952-85 U.s. data lend some support to a
version of the tax-smoothing theory of inflation. This finding may

be due to the relatively low power of a short sample period,
or it may reflect sub-sample instability, which Barsky (1987)
suggests is present in long time series of U.S. inflation. Using a
broader country (and time) sample, Grilli (1988b) and Poterba and
Rotemberg (1988) find evidence against the tax-smoothing theory's
general validity. The evidence in chart 1 suports Fischer's (1986,

p. 14) observation that "Going further back in history, it is
clear that inflationary bias is only a sometime thing. At the ends
of the Napoleonic and Civil Wars, and World War I, Britain and the
United States deflated to get back to fixed gold parities. These

episodes too deserve attention in the dynamic inconsistency
literature."

albeit less dramatic, of the type of event Fischer describes.

ratio of nominal to real income as reported in table 4.8 of Milton

role of time inconsistency in inflation taxation do not offer
predictions about the equilibrium dynamics of government debt and
of tax rates; in contrast, monetary tax-smoothing models do offer
an account of these dynamics, but one that fails as an equilibrium

theory because of its failure to confront and resolve the
time-inconsistency issue. By merging the two approaches below
using a time-consistent equilibrium construct, however, I derive a

theory consistent with the story told by chart 1. The theory

predicts that at each point in time at which inflation is
positive, it is higher than it would be if the government could

precornmit itself to future tax policies. But the theory also
predicts that, given rational private expectations, government

tax-smoothing behavior results in an inflation rate with a
tendency to fall over time toward the government's preferred

government debt management policies can be used to ensure the time

consistency of optimal plans. Were such schemes generally
feasible, the naive tax-smoothing models might be resuscitated as

viable positive theories. Particularly in monetary economies,
however, it appears that the scope for such fine-tuning is very
limited. The nature of these limitations is discussed in section V

below. Poterba and Rotemberg (1988) consider the role of time
inconsistency in tax-smoothing inflation models, but they do not

focus on the dynamics of tax rates and government debt. Bohn
(1988) uses a framework similar to the one developed below to
study government motives for nominal debt issue in a stochastic
environment.

responsible for the economy's dynamics is the stock of government

debt. In the time-consistent intertemporal (Nash) equilibrium
constructed below, the government's inflation policy reaction

function is optimal, given the private rule for forecasting
inflation; at the same time, private forecasts are rational, given

the government's objectives and constraints. Phelps and Pollak

(1968), in a model of

capital accumulation by successive

generations, presented an

early economic application of the

equilibrium concept applied here.5
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section I sets up a

model economy in which the government maximizes an inter temporal

welfare criterion that is decreasing in current inflation but
increasing in private real money balances. Section II describes
the government's optimal p1 an in a Stackelberg game, and shows why

the plan generally is time inconsistent. Section III contains the

equilibrium,

inflation has a tendency to fall over time. Section iv provides a

results can be checked numerically. Section V examines some

I. The Model

The analysis is developed in a setting due to Brock (1974). A

single representative private agent consumes a single perishable,

nonproduced consumption good. At the start of period t, the
representative agent maximizes

+ g + v(m)],

where c is private consumption; g is government consumption, which

enters linearly into private utility; m stands for real money
balances (nominal balances M divided by the price level P);
is the subjective discount factor; and v(m) is twice continuously
differentiable and strictly concave.

Conditions necessary for individual optimality are well

known. The linearity of utility in consumption fixes the

however, the measure relevant to the present setup. Notice that it

approaches an upper bound of 1 as the conventionally-defined

intepretation as a tax rate, with it — 1 the confiscatory rate.7

The economy is endowed with a fixed "natural" output level y,

but the amount of output available to be consumed falls when the

actual inflation rate rises. Specifically, equilibrium private

for example, the reduction in production efficiency often said to
accompany higher inflation. Alternatively, c(ir) allows inflation

"surprises" to inflict social Costs distinct from those of
perfectly anticipated inflation.

The government must undertake a fixed level of consumption

each period, so g — g, a constant.8 In the model, however, only
two sources of public finance are available, the proceeds of money

creation and the proceeds of borrowing from the private sector.

The presence of nonmonetary taxes in the formal model would not

along the lines of Phelps (1973) would have implications for tax

with other taxes. Poterba and Rotemberg (1988) and Crilli (1988b)
present empirical evidence on the covariation of inflation with
other forms of taxation. Their evidence is not entirely consistent
with Phelpss prescription.

This equation states that seigniorage is derived from two sources,

The second means by which the government can finance budget
deficits (surpluses) is the sale (purchase) of price-level indexed
bonds that are not subject to default. Many of the dynamic results

derived below may continue to hold when government debt
obligations are denominated entirely in domestic currency, rather

than indexed. The introduction of nominal debt complicates the
technical analysis considerably, however, and also creates a clear

potential for multiple equilibriums. Consideration of these
difficulties is postponed until section V.

A bond has a fixed real face value (of unity) and pays
interest p after a period. The stock of such instruments held by
the government at the end of period s, a, evolves according to

coincide is to assume that output is lost when inflation deviates,
not from zero, but from Friedman's full liquidity rate, -p. If it

is assumed in addition that full liquidity occurs at a finite
level of real balances m, with increments to real balances beyond
this point yielding zero utility, then the economy converges, not
to zero inflation as it does below, but to deflation at rate p,

the formulation above assumes that the private sector and
government have the same discount rate, an assumption made in most

of the tax-smoothing literature. Consequences of relaxing this
assumption are discussed briefly at the end of section III.

II. Precommitment Equilibrium

If the government can precommit to follow chosen policies,
the resulting equilibrium is the outcome of a Stackelberg game in

which the government moves first, and moves only once. If this
game is played at t — 1, say, the government announces its choice

of a policy path for the entire future, taking into account that
each private individual's best response under precommitment is to

believe the announcement. The equilibrium policy path is the one
that maximizes

of (5) when it is correctly anticipated by the

public. This section examines the precommitment solution and

describes how it breaks down as an equilibrium concept when

policies are not pre-set,

but are chosen instead on a

discretionary basis in the period of their implementation.

In the model with precommitment, a government moving on
date 1 picks an inflation path tss—l that maximizes W1 subject to

the public-sector intertemporal budget constraint, the private
optimality conditions

pm. (In this long-run equilibrium, government interest earnings
in excess of g are simply used to retire circulating money.) The
problem with this formulation is its lack of realism: the kinds of
inflation costs summarized in the function k(,r) are difficult to
ascribe empirically to deviations of inflation from -p.

and given inherited levels of aggregate real balances, m, and
government assets, a0. Constraint (6) embodies the government's
rational belief that if all future policies are iriunutably set on

date 1, it will be in each private individual's interest to use
those known policy settings in forecasting inflation, and thus in
deciding how much money to hold.1'
Strictly speaking, the government does not choose the path of
prices. That path is instead the outcome of a market equilibration
process that the government controls indirectly through the amount

of money it issues. Given the announced inflation path, the
government must engineer a path for nominal money consistent with
market clearing on each date. The constraints on the government's

plan ensure that such a money-supply path exists and is unique;
and if speculative price-level bubbles are ruled out, that unique

money-supply path necessarily produces, in equilibrium,

the

announced path of prices.12

To derive necessary first-order conditions (for an interior

maximum) from the standpoint of date 1, let ''—l be a sequence
of multipliers associated with the finance constraints (4), and
consider the Lagrangian

11Notice that the price level in the period prior to government
choice, P0, is an historical datum. Therefore, choice of the price

level's path from t —

I

on is equivalent to choice of the

inflation rate from t — 1 on.

12A formal proof could be constructed along the lines of Calvo
(l978b, appendix 1). On mechanisms for ruling out price-level
bubbles, see Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983, 1986).

term on the right-hand side of (9) is nonnegative, (9) cannot hold

if the three inflation rates appearing in it are the same, as
required for time consistency. Thus, the optimal policy under
precommitment is time inconsistent: on date 2, the planner, if

an initial inflation rate ir'

as seen from date 2, will thus call for an initial inflation rate

higher than that in later periods, in contrast to the flat
inflation rate from date 2 onward called for by the date-I plan.

In other words, on date 2 the government need no longer take
account of the effect its choice of it2 has on date-l money demand.

III. Time-Consistent Equilibrium

The time

inconsistency of the

precomlnitment solut ion

disqualifies it as an equilibrium of a dynamic economy in which
all agents continually reoptimize. Private agents who understand

the government's objectives and constraints will attempt to
forecast the government's actions on the basis of its budgetary
conditions, and perhaps other variables. The government, in turn,

will consider the effects of its policies on private forecasts;
but it is likely to view itself as influencing private forecasts
only through current and past policies, and not through the mere
announcement of future policies. In such a setting, equilibrium is

most naturally analyzed in terms of policy and forecasting rules

that relate actions to the variables defining the economy S

17

current state. A time-consistent equilibrium is decribed by a

policy rule that maximizes the government's objective function
each period, given that private agents forecast on the basis of

the rule and that the government takes the private forecasting
rule to be beyond its control.

In this section, the foregoing notion of time-consistent
equilibrium is explored. The Nash game considered here posits
decision rules for private individuals that are parametric for the
policyTnaker and that depend, through the system's state variables,

on past and current policies, but not on announced future
policies. These features of the setup ensure time consistency.

In the present context, the state of the economy on any date
t is assumed to be fully described by the predetermined variables

entering the government's budget constraint for that date,

and ai. This assumption means that only policy and forecasting

rules without memory are considered. The state of the economy

could conceivably include (in addition to mi and ai) policy
actions taken in the past or even extrinsic variables, but this

study does not adopt so broad a view. In particular, possible
reputational equilibriums of the type Rogoff (1989) critically
reviews are ignored.'8

reaction functions to depend on state vectors that may explicitly
include past government actions along with the more conventional
state variables (for example, asset stocks) usually considered.
(Chari and Kehoe refer to these vectors as "histories.") The
equilibrium singled out below corresponds to the Markov perfect
equilibrium studied, in a quite different setting, by Maskin and

Necessary condition (10) equates the marginal output cost of

inflation to the shadow value

proportional to last period's real balances. The second, intertemporal condition, (11), equates the current marginal value of
public resources, A, to the payoff from raising government saving

by a unit in period s and then returning government assets to
their initial path in period s+1.

The latter payoff can be viewed as the sum of three
components. The first sununand on the right-hand side of (11) is
the direct marginal value product of an additional unit of saving,

that is, the discounted gross rate of return on saving, fl(l+p),
valued at next period'.s resource shadow price, A÷l. If this term

described fully the marginal return to government saving, then

since (l+p) — 1,

A would be constant over time, as in the

precomniitment solution. The two remaining sumniands on
right-hand side of (11), however, capture additional,

the

indirect

effects of government saving on the government's objective

function. Both indirect effects are a consequence of the
assumption '

the main economic factor driving the declining time path of
inflation described below. The rest of this section is devoted to
analyzing the model's dynamic equilibrium.

To start, consider the implications of conditions (l0)-(l2)
for the government's policy rule. Because m —

for s

equations (l0)-(12) can be reduced to a (generally nonlinear)

difference equation system in the costate variable A

and

government assets a. Given m0 and a0, an initial costate value
determines it1

[via

(10) for s — 1] and thus a1 [via (12) for s

1]; the subsequent paths of A and a are then determined by the
first-order conditions, with inflation rates coming from (10). An

optimal plan entails an initial choice A such that the resulting
path of the economy maximizes the government's objective function.

Let V(m 1,a l be the value function for the government's
problem at the start of period s, when the previous period's real

balances and government assets are m51 and a1 respectively. As

Kydland and Prescott (1977) explained how a time-consistent
equilibriuni can be viewed as the limit of a sequence of iterations

in which, at each step, private forecasting rules are updated to
reflect fully the policy rules that were optimal in the previous
iteration, given the private forecasting rule then being used. In
this equilibrium, it is optimal each period for the government to

results concerning the existence or uniqueness of this type of
equilibrium seem to exist, except in the linear case (see Cohen
and Michel). Section IV,

below,

contains a linear example that can

be viewed as an approximation to the present model.23

Having defined a time-consistent equilibrium, the next step
is to characterize it. Suppose that the public bases its forecasts

;(ma) which, at the same time, describes

the government's best inflation response given this rule. As shown
earlier, the forecasting rule can be expressed, in equilibrium, in

the alternative form r1— .y*(a), where y*(a) solves the

231f there are multiple time-consistent equilibriums, it is at
least conceivable (but far from obvious) that the government will
be a dominant player, in the sense that the public will follow it
if it announces a time-consistent plan. Such a dominant-player
role could allow the government to coordinate expectations on the
time-consistent equilibrium that leads to the highest value of its
objective function. Barro and Gordon (1983, p. 112) seem to have
this idea in mind when they assume, in their setting, that the
government can choose the reputational inflation equilibrium it
prefers.

the result is

the condition u' (r)/mi — u' (1r5÷1)/m5 appearing in Mankiw (1987)
and Grilli (1988a, 1988b): it is optimal for the government to
stabilize the ratio of the marginal output cost of inflation to
the inflation-tax base, which, with constant money demand, would
require a flat inflation path and an unchanging government asset

level. Since the government is taking money demand as given

in

this special case, inflation costs caused by reductions in the
utility from money use [and represented by the function z(m)] do
not appear in the intertemporal smoothing condition.

When

(a) < 0,

however, (14) shows that the ratio

and thus inflation itself, declines over time. As
observed earlier, additional government saving now yields a gross

physical return li-p plus the extra benefits from the induced

increase in money demand [see (11)1. Since the government's
discount factor is just l/(l+p), the government will accumulate
bonds, which it can do by always setting inflation higher than the
level consistent with an unchanging stock of government assets.

in assuming that the government and private sector share a common

rate.

Under plausible

assumptions,

however,

the

government discount rate will exceed the private rate. For
example, policymakers may discount the future more heavily than
private agents because they face some probability of being removed

from office. In formal terms, a positive difference between the
in

government and private discount rates amounts to lowering

remains a stationary state of the model; however, the A(a)

schedule in figure 2 may now cross the B(a1) schedule to
the left of the origin, a possibility that would give rise to
multiple stationary states, alternately stable and unstable.

Notice that the model does not imply that governments always

run surpluses. As in any model with some tax smoothing, the time

pattern of deficits depends on the time pattern of government
spending which, for simplicity, was assumed above to be flat. The
model is easily extended to account for an exogenously varying and
perfectly foreseen path of government spending. Just respecify the

equations in terms of a state variable equal to government assets
less the present discounted value of future government spending:

(15) a h—0

(1)h+l

Rewriting the model in terms of the state variable (15)
leads to some predictions about the relation between expenditure
changes and deficits. Sufficiently large, sufficiently temporary

28

innovations in public spending, for example, will induce the

government to engage in partial tax smoothing by raising inflation
and running a larger deficit. (Inflation will be more sensitive to

expenditure innovations than in a model with complete tax
smoothing, however.) Once spending has returned to normal,
however, inflation will not remain at a permanently higher level,
but will instead tend to come do.in over time.

The steady-state of the economy is now one in which the
deficit is zero on average: absent unexpected shocks, asset income

just covers the annuity value of the government expenditure path,
and there is no need ever to use the inflation tax.

IV. A Linear ExampLe

A closed-form linear example illustrates the characteristics
of the equilibrium described in the last section. For the purpose
of the example, I assume that z(m)

0, so that inflation reduces

welfare only through its negative effect on current output.

The key trick in obtaining a linear example is to redefine the

model, not in terms of inflation, but in terms of the inflation
tax levied on money holders, r, where

which past as well as current expectations of future inflation

taxation coincide with the policy. Once a solution along

V. Nominal Government Debt

The model has assumed until now that all public debt takes
the form of promises to deliver specified amounts of real output
on future dates. In many countries, however, much (or most) public

debt is denominated in local currency, not output. This section
briefly sketches some ways in which the presence of home-currency
government debt could change conclusions reached above.

There are two main differences compared with the previous
analysis. First, nominal debt may lead to multiple equilibriums

through a channel absent above,

the effect of inflation

expectations on nominal interest rates.28 If all public debt is

nominal, however, there still appears to be a time-consistent
equilibrium in which inflation falls over time.

The second main difference, which I regard as a theoretical

curiosity because of its knife-edge nature, arises when the
government can issue indexed and nominal debt side by side. Once

28Calvo (l988a) analyzes a two-period model in which such
multiplicities can occur.

buy and issue nominal debt only. A nominal bond issued in period s

is a promise to pay l+i currency units in period s+l, where is is

the period-s nominal interest rate. If a denotes the real value

of net nominal government claims on the public at the end of
period s, the government's finance constraint takes the form

that even under a constant real interest rate, as here, the
government may have incentives to issue longer-term obligations
when all public debt is currency-denominated. The presence of such

Only at the low-inflation intersection in figure 4 is it the
case

that higher government assets a (which shift

the

c-function downward) lower equilibrium inflation expectations; at
the high-inflation intersection, public asset accumulation appears

to worsen the inflation outlook. Given a favorable outcome in
figure 4, however, the government has the additional motives for

asset accumulation that drive the results of the last two
sections. If a time-consistent equilibrium exists in this case,
one would therefore expect the earlier analysis to go through much

as before, despite the currency denomination of the public debt.

Equilibrium dynamics in an economy where the unfavorable
forecasting rule is adopted remain mysterious. It seems doubtful

to me that a time-consistent equilibrium

(in which

the

intertemporal government budget constraint is met) can exist in a

setting where increasing public deficits are accompanied by
falling inflation.

30

Attaining the precoimnitment path. When the government can

given a nominal public debt in the form of consols, the analogue

of equation (29) has a unique solution because 3c/37r÷i

everywhere. (Higher inflation expectations would lower the real
present value of future public debt-service obligations if debt
took the form of nominal consols.) In Calvo's (l988b) model, the
presence of real as well as nominal government debt, as in the
next case considered below, removes the motivation for a richer
nominal term structure, given the fixed real interest rate.

300f course, there could be a third, higher-inflation intersection

in figure 4, at which the c-function crossed the 45° line from
above. There, just as at the low-inflation intersection, higher
government assets would lower equilibrium expected inflation.

will face in future periods. Open-market switches between real and
nominal debt, at a given price level, alter the inflation-tax base

faced in the following period, and may allow the government to
sustain the precommitment solution as an equilibrium.

debt that
Persson,

Persson, and Svensson (1987) argued that the natural extension of

the Lucas-Stokey idea to a monetary economy involves an exact

balancing of the government's net nominal bond holdings against
its monetary liab ilities, that is, a zero net position in home
currency. Because Persson, Persson, and Svensson assumed away any

explicit cost of inflation surprises, a zero net position in home

currency appears necessary, in their framework, to ensure time
consistency; but as Calvo and Obstfeld (1988) have shown, that

prescription is also sufficient only under quite unrealistic
conditions. Appropriate debt management avoids time inconsistency

42

above because the real interest rate is fixed (so that the termstructure issues raised by Lucas and Stokey don't arise), because

all nominal debt matures after a single period, and because
unanticipated as well as anticipated inflation is socially costly.

Real interest rates vary in practice and governments do deal

in long-term instruments; so the above scheme cannot be taken
literally as describing official behavior in actual economies.31 The

example nonetheless highlights incentives that may infuence
governments to some degree. Unfortunately, the problem of modeling

equilibrium with both real and nominal securities appears to be

quite difficult once a setting of any generality is assumed.
Success in this area would yield, not only positive predictions
about government deficits and inflation, but insight into the mix
of real and nominal government debt issue actually observed.

It is worth noting that the paper's central conclusions about

the dynamics of time-consistent equilibriums would probably
survive the introduction of a variable real interest rate. With
a flexible marginal utility of consumption, a declining inflation

path would imply rising output and a falling real interest rate.

A tendency for the real interest rate to fall would, in turn,
reinforce the tendency for public-sector deficits and inflation to

decline over time. Such an extension of the present model could
help explain the "stylized" fact that real interest rates are high
at the beginning of hyperinflation stabilization programs.

3LThis is probably fortunate, since few (if any) governments have
positive net holdings of domestic-currency bonds.
43

VI. Conclusion

This paper has explored the dynamic behavior of seigniorage

in a time-consistent equilibrium with government borrowing and
lending. A major positive implication of the paper is that in the
absence of unforeseen shocks, governments will shrink their budget

deficits over time so as to reduce the need for inflationary
finance (or, for that matter, for other distorting taxes).

Before matching theory to data, stochastic disturbances (to

government spending requirements, say) would have to be worked
into the model. At least as an approximation, such a model should
replicate the stationary behavior of inflation evident in chart 1

of section I. The underlying cause of this behavior- -that in a
time-consistent equilibrium,

there are incentives for debt

reduction beyond the physical return on assets--should still
operate in a stochastic setting.

Although the model yields predictions consistent with the
long-term behavior of U.K. and U.S. prices, it is less clear that

it captures well the apparently chronic inflation in many
developing countries, where seigniorage

is typically more

important than in the industrialized world. The model helps

explain, however, why governments in budgetary crisis often
sharply devalue their currencies in the foreign exchange market,

thereby spurring domestic inflation but (hopefully) promoting
increases in official foreign reserves.32 A partial rationale for

devaluing at the outset of stabilization is to lower future

Empl.oyment and distribution goals, two factors absent from

paper's model, appear particularly important.33 Nonetheless, the

paper seems useful as a first attempt at explaining one
factor- - the

key one in some countries- -driving the dynamics of

inflation under discretionary policy formulation.

33The results of table 1 show long-run inflation rates for the U.K.

and U.S. that are positive rather than zero. This result is
inconsistent with a literal interpretation of the paper's model,
but could be explained by a government target inflation rate that

(for some reason) exceeds zero, or by policy considerations
independent of the public finances that influence inflation
choices.

Appendix. Interpreting the Government's Value Function

This appendix derives the link between the costate variable

associated with a solution to the maximization problem of
section III and the partial derivatives of the value function

V(m1,a1) for the problem.

After substituting [(a5)] for m in government finance
constraint (12), one can write that equation in the form

—

a

(Al)

[Inequality

(13) is still assumed.] With the aid of this notation,

the value function can be defined as

The

partial derivatives of (m1,a1,1r) are easily

computed. For example, the partial derivative
