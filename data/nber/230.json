    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper is another contribution to the vast literature which addresses this issue: comparison of household income per capita among households of different structures requires judgment about the relationship between real income and family size. Our work uses a revealed preference approach in which household size/structure variables are included in empirical demand studies and the estimated coefficients on these variables are used to infer equivalence; it differs from many of the other studies not in basic concept but in its empirical strategy. While most studies build family composition effects into a relatively formal structural model of demand and impose considerable restriction in order to obtain an estimable system, we use a reduced-form approach which requires much less of the data.\n\n",
