The U.S. Capital Stock in
the Nineteenth Century
ABSTRACT

This paper ——

prepared for and presented at a meeting of the

Conference on Research in Income and Wealth ——

describes

a set of

seven capital stock estimates for the U.S., distributed at decennial
intervals, 1840 through 1900.

The estimates link with Raymond Goldsmith's work on the twentieth
century to form a capital stock series covering well over 100 years

of U.S. history. The paper describes the theoretical underpinnings of
the new estimates, the sources of the evidence from which they were
constructed, the types of estimating procedures followed, and the

relationships of the new series to other economic aggregates. A few
of the ways in which the series illuminates the nature of the
nineteenth century U.S. economy and the course of U.S. economic

development are taken up.

The U.S. Capital Stock in the Nineteenth Century
Robert E. Gallman*

This paper describes the results of work
begun many years ago bY Edward S. Howle and me and

carried forward intermittently since then bY me.
Howle and I estimated the value of the U.S. fixed
capital stock (current and 1860 prices) at decade
intervals,

1840

to 1900,

and circulated

in

n,neographed form a manuscript describing our
estimating procedures (Gailman and Howle, ND.).
This manuscript was never published, although it

served as the basis for a number of descriptive
and analytical papers bY us and bY others (Galiman

and Hc'wle, 1971; Davis and Gailman, 1973, 1978;

Davis et al, 1973, Ch. 2; Galiman, 1965, 1972).

While Howle and

incomplete and chose to delay publication until we

were more fully satisfied with it.

We wanted to

run additional tests in particular, Howle thought

that appropriate samples from the manuscript
census (SoltOwts work (Soltow, 1975) ultimately
met our requirements) would give us the means for

strong tests of a set of important estimating
decisions. A number of minor sectoral estimates
had been hastily made, and we believed that they
could be improved with more research and a little
ingenuity. We also wanted to extend the series to

earlier years, add figures for elements of the
capital stock ignored in our original manuscript,
and work out regional distributions of the totals.

Our decision to delay was a mistake. Both of

us were drawn off

The manuscript entered the

underground of research; it was occasionally cited
and our data were used, but it was never subjected

to the constructive criticism that publication
would have brought. We should have remembered that

the series to earlier years.

This does not mean1

of course, that the work is now complete —— sound
and durable in every respect. It is certainly not.
Gaps remain (for example, there are no figures for

the value p1 roadways), and there are any number
of ways in which the existing estimates could be
improved.

But additions and improvements must be

left, for the time being, perhaps to be carried

out eventually bY other hands.

The existing

estimates seem to me ready for formal presentation
to the scholarly community, at long last.

is not space enough here to include estimating

run in excess of 200 manuscript pages, more than

the Conference would happily publish.

character of the principal sources used, and the
theoretical concepts that guided the work. These
subjects are treated in the next section, Section

the

Goldsmith and Kuznets series, as well as the
original Gallman and Howle figures (Goldsmith,

1952; Kuznets, 1946; Gailman and Howle, n.d.;
Gallman, 1965). Section 4 considers the ways in
which the new series illuminate the nature of. the

nineteenth century U.S. economy and the course of
U.S. economic development.

The new series contain estimates of the
value of land (except agricultural land in 1840).

Uses of Capital Stock Estimates

There are at least four scholarly uses for
aggregate capital stock series,
(1)

They can be used in place of national

product series——or in addition to national product

series——to describe the scale, structure, and
growth of the economy. There is no reason why,

over short, or even intermediate periods, the
capital stock should grow at exactly the pace of
the national product, but over the long run there
should be a considerable degree of similarity. For

this reason capital stock series have sometimes
been used as proxies for national product series

in the measurement of long-term growth (Jones,
1980).

But one could easily make a case for the

6

use of such series as independent indexes of
growth,

not

simply as proxies for

national

product. Looked at (and measured) in one way, the

capital stock of a given Year describes the
piled—up savings of the past; looked at (and
measured) in a different way, it is a vision of
future production (see below), Either way, we have

a picture of the economy that is different from
the one provided by the national product, and one
that is analytically useful.
(2)

Capital stock series have appeared as

arguments in consumption functions and, thereby,
in the analysis of the level of economic activity,

cyclical variations, and economic growth. Land and
consumers'

durables are helpful additions to

capital in these uses, as are paper claims.
(3)

The capital stock is a consequence of

savings and investment decisions, with which are

tied up choices of technique.

The level and

structure of the capital stock emerge out of these

decisions, and capital stock series figure in the
study of them.

(4) Finally, capital stock series are used

in the analysis of production relationships and
the sources of economic growth, a practice that

has been at the heart of one of the major
theoretical disputes of the post—war period.

7

In this paper the capital stock series are

put chiefly to the first use and, to a limited
extent, to the third and fourth.

2

Methods of Estimating the Capital Stock

Capital stock estimates maybe made in two
ways: they may be cumulated from annual investment
flow data (Raymond Goldsmith's perpetual inventory
method--Goldsmith, 1956), or they may be assembled
from censuses of the capital stock.

If census and

annual flow data were perfectly accurate, if the
identical concepts were embodied in each, and if
appropriate estimating procedures were used, then

perpetual inventory and census procedures would
yield the same results.

narrow the margins of difference often are.

The choice between the two techniques turns

on the types and quality of data available. From

1850 through 1900 there were six reasonably

the

extraordinarily well conceived and careful work of

Albert Fishlow (1965, 1956) on the railroads. We

used Fishlow's estimates as the bases for our
railroad series and similarly exploited the work

of Cranmer (1960), Segal (1961), North (1960),

Simon (1960), and Ulmer (1960) on canals, the
international sector, telephones, and electric

light and power.

We also built up our own

perpetual inventory figures for the telegraph
industry and for consumers' durables.

No doubt

other sectoral estimates could be constructed,
with profit, from flow data, although I doubt that

the remaining opportunities are quantitatively
important. The estimates described in this paper
are

census—style data (see Table 1).

story is told elsewhere; I will also make brief
reference to it subsequently in this paper (see
Davis and Galiman, 1973; Gallman, 1983).

Valuation of Capital

In principle, capital stocks might be valued

in any number of ways. 3
•

In practice, there are

only three ways of any importance, two of which
exist in two variants.

(I yefer here, to current

price estimates; constant price estimates are
discussed below.)

Capital may be valued at

acquisition cost (which I will also refer to as
book value), at reproduction cost, and at market
value.

4

Acquisition cost corresponds to the notion
(expressed above) of the capital stock as piled—up
savings.

The great difficulty posed by such

estimates is that the capital stock of each year
is valued in the prices of many years, so that no

meaningful comparisons (at least none that comes

to my mind) can be made. This difficulty can be

10

overcome bY adjusting the data by means of a
general price index——a consumer price index would
be best——so that all elements of the capital stocl<

of a given Year are expressed in the prices of

that

year. A capital stoct.:: so valued retains the

sense of acquisition cost: the valuation expresses
the

capital

stock

in

terms

of

foregone

consumption. The foregone consumption consists of

the consumption goods given up in the year of
investment, expressed in the prices of th.e year to

which the capital

stock: estimate refers.

Unambiguous comparisons can thus be drawn ——

with

the national product of the same year,

for

examp 1 e.

The capital stock may also be valued at
reproduction cost.

Each item is valued at the

cost of the resources that would be required to

replicate it in the year to which the capital
stock estimate refers, given the factor prices and
techniques of production of that year. The capital

expresses the income that capital is expected to

earn, discounted back to the Year to which the
estimate refers. Such a measure would be useful •in

consumption function applications, as well as in
describing the scale and structure of the economy.

Book and reproduction cost measures differ,
theoretically, in

that the former measures the

capital stoci.:: in terms of what was given up to

obtain it, while the latter measures the capital
stock in terms of what would have to be given up

in the current year to reproduce it.

In an

unchanging economy in equilibrium, these measures
would be identical.

In an economy in which there

were no changes except in the price level, they
could be made identical bY means of the deflation
adjustment described above. In the absence of this

adjustment, book value would exceed reproduction

12

cost whenever the price level was falling, and
vice versa. Changes in relative prices could lead
to the divergence of the two measures, even after

adjustment. Thus if the prices of capital goods

the latter fell slightly as compared with the
former (see Brady, 1964, and Historical

Statistics 1960, series El, 7,8). Between 1859 and
1869—1878, the former rose dramatically, while the

latter did not (Gallman, 1966). The two then fell
pronouncedly until nearly the end of the century,
the latter declining the mare markedly. Thus, for

the dates of concern to this paper, book value

In

an unchanging economy in equilibrium, and with
perfect knowledge, book value and market value
would differ only in that the former treats each
piece of capital as though it were new, while the
latter does not.

Even in an unchanging economy1

fixed capital would gradually wear out. Therefore

old fixed capital would sell for less than new
fixed capital, and a capital stock expressed in
market values would be smaller than one expressed
in bool:: values.

(there are profits

or losses) and capital consumption allowances fail

to reflect precisely the structure of prices of
capital of differing age. Thus divergences arise

Finally,

that

the

deviations among net book value, net reproduction

recently produced; in equilibrium, there is no

deviation at all for new goods.

The faster a

capital stoct:: grows, ceteris paribus, the lower

the average age of capital and the narrower the
differences among boot.:: value, reproduction cost,
and rriarket value. As will appear, the U.S capital

stock grew at an extraordinarily rapid pace in the

nineteenth century. Thus the application of the
three concepts might produce net valuations that
differed little from one concept to the next. The

market value and reproduction cost of inventories

also will normally differ little. Thus the more

important inventories are in the total capital
stoc!.::, the smaller the disparity between aggregate

reproduction cost and aggregate market value,
ceteris paribus.

Data are less than abundant and less than perfect;
the assembly of estimates is not costless.

the

procedure is not problem-free. Market values and
census—type figures on reproduction cost are very
much harder to obtain. Few elements of the capital

stock (apart from goods held in inventory) are
sold in any given year. If the capital stock is to

be valued at market prices, imputations must be
drawn from recorded prices in marl.::ets that may be

17

very thin.

Estimating reproduction cast is even

more difficult, since it sometimes requires that

one work out the cost,

in a given Year, of

producing, a goad which, in fact, was not produced
in that year.

These are familiar points. But we

should not lose sight of the fact that market and
reproduction costs are constantly being estimated,

and that there are experts who spend their lives

at these tasks ——

experts hired by insurance

companies, the loan departments of banks, and
various tax offices. Indeed, most of us here today

who own homes have a fair idea of what they would
bring, on the market, or how much it would take to

rebuild them, despite the recent gyrations of the
real estate market.
In the nineteenth century, boot.:: value data

were much less common than they are today. Until

late in the century, most firms charged off
capital purchases on current account. Thus there
were few books to refer to when the census taker
came

around.

Perhaps

important,

businessmen did not think in terms of book value.

It was much mare natural for them to appraise
plant and equipment in terms of what it would take
to replace it, should it all burn down, or what it

might sell for. This was even more clearly the
case for farmers and householders viewing their

18

property.

These nctions of value seem to have

influenced the designers of census questions.
While the questions are bY no means always crystal

clear, they seem to refer most often to market
value or net reproduction cost.

(The two concepts

are not always clearly distinguished.) There is
little doubt——especially for the first three or
four census dates——that book value was only rarely
sought bY census takers. How rarely is a matter on

which there is not full agreement. Howle and I

especially in view of the wide margins for error

that must be assigned to the estimates. What is

more important is the question of whether the
census measurements of fixed capital are net or
grass. Here we have access to a test that does not

rely on the interpretation of nineteenth century
language.

We can check the census data (land

improvements and manufactured producers' durables,

separately) against perpetual inventory estimates

based on reproduction cast.

The story of these

tests has been told elsewhere (Davis and Gallman,

1973; Galiman, 1983) and will be told again in
more detail in still another place, so I offer
only a brief summary here: The net reproduction
cost estimates check quite closely with the census

aggregates before the Civil War, suggesting that
the latter are, indeed, net valuations. There is
also some support for the notion that the census

valuations refer to reproduction cost and that
they are accurate. The post—war fit is poorer, but

the evidence for the belief that the census
figures are net is strong: the perpetual inventory
figures typically exceed the census figures.

our estimates for the

In these cases, however, the

form of the data left open the possibility of
constructing book value series.

In order to

maintain consistency with most of the rest of the

work——and because we believed they would prove
more useful——we chose to produce reproduction cost
estimates instead.

The capital stock figures, thus, consist
chiefly of net reproduction cost or market value
estimates, as Table 1 indicates. The assignment of

items to the reproduction cost category in that
table is sure, but the same cannot be said of the

estimates referred to as "market value." For a
number of these, the valuation may, in fact, refer
to

cost.

The

practical

distinctions between these two types of measures
on the dates to which the capital stock estimates
refer, however, are unlikely to be very important,
for reasons previously given.

23

testing during the construction of the estimates.

The estimating and testing notes are much too
extensive to be included here.

Some general

statements of appraisal can be ventured, however.
The evidence is considerably weaker for 1840
and 1870 than for the other census dates. The 1840

census provided much less comprehensive wealth
data than did the censuses in subsequent years
(although with respect to the trade sector it was
unusually helpful). Also, prices fell dramatically

across that census year, which means that it is

very important to date the available evidence
correctly. We cannot be absolutely sure that we

have done so.

The census dragged on for an

inordinate length of time, so that the dating of

census magnitudes is problematical. We also were

obliged to depend heavily on the work of Ezra
Seaman (1852), who was not always entirely clear
as to his valuation base. The 1870 census came at

a difficult time, and it is widely believed that

Southern wealth was badly returned (Ransom and
Sutch, 1975). Nonetheless, it must be said that
the results of the perpetual inventory tests for
these two dates do not impugn the stock estimates.

Of course the test is particularly difficult to

run for 1840 and 1870, and the results must be
regarded as particularly chancy.

Still, it is

24

moderately reassuring that the stock and flow
estimates are at least as consistent at these
dates as at any others in our series.°

The test for 1880 is less successful.

below.

It is perhaps sufficient to say here that

the capital stock figures are much more likely to

tell an accurate story of the long—term rate of
growth and structural changes of the capital stock

than of the decade—to—decade changes, and this is
particularly true after 1860.

Constant Price Series

The best capital stock deflators available

are to be found among the price index numbers

assembled by Dorothy Brady (1966)

to deflate

components of the GNP. The Brady indexes are the

best for several reasons:

If

the economy were in

equilibrium in all the relevant years, such that
market prices and reproduction costs of new goods

were identical, and if the prices of new and old
goods moved closely together over time (i.e. the
interest rate was the same at each relevant date
and the rate of obsolescence was unchanging), then

deflation of capital stock estimates valued in

market prices or net reproduction costs would
yield a cc'nstant price series expressed in net
reproduction costs. That is, it would produce a

series in which each element measured the net
reproduction cost of the capital stock, given the
factor prices and techniques of producing capital
goods of the base year. Of course these conditions

were surely not met:

it

as such,

therefore, throughout the rest of this paper.

While the Brady inde>es were the chief
deflators we used, other price data figure in

(Gallinan,

The Brady indexes refer to the census years
(beginning on June 1 of the years ending in 9 and

ending on May 31 of the years ending in zero)
before the Civil War, and to calendar years ending
in 9 after the Civil War. The current year capital

28

There are both conceptual and substantive
differences between the old Gailman—Howle capital

stock estimates and the new ones reported on in

this paper. The conceptual differences are the
more important.

When Howle and I estimated the value of
property employed in agriculture we decided to
extract from the value of agricultural land (and

to list separately) the value of agricultural
structures1 but to treat all other agricultural

improvements as part of the value of land,

We

wanted to be able to link our series with series

extending into the twentieth century, and we
believed that this treatment of agricultural land
and

improvements would bring our work

into

conceptual alignment with the twentieth century
estimates.11

When I came back to this work I

decided that a second set of estimates should be
made, in which all land improvements are treated
as capital, as of course they are. These estimates
would go to make up a capital stock series roughly
corresponding, conceptually, with the GNPII series

29
of my paper in Volume 30 of Studies in Income and
Wealth (Galiman, 1966). For purposes of analyzing
nineteenth century developments, the GNPII series

is certainly more appropriate than the GNPI
series; similarly,

the broader capital stock

series would be superior fQr these purposes to the
narrower one.

I made estimates of the reproduction cost of

clearing arid breaking farm land, fencing it, and
draining and irrigating it, all of these estimates

based on the work of Martin Primack (1962), as I
have previously indicated. The value of fences was
taken net of capital consumption. Retirements were

deducted from the other items, but no allowance
was made for capital consumption, on the ground

that normal maintenance would prevent physical
deterioration of these improvements. Clearly some

deduction in value should have been made to
account for the deterioration of improvements on

land withdrawn from production but

important this matter may be,

I

How

do not know,

although I doubt that it is of great importance.

Farm improvements (exclusive of structures)

constituted a very large part of the capital
stock, but

part that declined in relative

a

importance as time passed. Thus roughly six—tenths

of the agricultural capital stock consisted of
these improvements in the years 1840 and 1850, a
fraction that fell to less than half, iii current

prices, in 1900, and something over one half, in
constant prices.

The fraction of total domestic

capital accounted for bY these improvements fell
from between three and a half and four—tenths in

1840, to just over one—tenth in 1900 (see Table
2).

It should be clear, then, that the new

Galiman—Howle capital stock series, inclusive of
improvements, is substantially larger than the old

one, and exhibits a substantially lower rate of
growth. These are matters to which I will return
below.

As I have already indicated, I also made a
number of substantive changes to the old Gailman
and Howle series.

So far as the current price

series are concerned, the chief changes are as
follows:

unavailable to Howle and me when we built up our
original series; i improved the price indexes for
shipping and railroad capital, which affected only
the current price series, since the constant price

series were estimated directly from data on
physical capital. On balance, these changes are
small so far as the Years 1840, 1850, 1860, and
1880 are concerned: in these years the new and
old12 national wealth series are within one and a
half percent of each other, once allowances are

made for differences in coverage between the two
series.13

In the remaining three years, the

margins are much wider: about 8 1/2 percent in

1870, and about 4 percent in 1890 and 1900, the
new estimates being below the old in each year.

For 1890 and 1900, the principal explanation lies

in the changes I have made in the price indexes

used to convert

the constant price railroad

improvments series into current prices.
Originally, Howle and I had used Ulmers (1960)

33

index, despite Fishlow's (1965, 1966) warning that

the price series incorporated therein and the
weights attached to them made the index inadequate
for our purposes.

I have now replaced this index

bY a new one, in which I have considerably greater
confidence.14

The new railroad improvements price index

and the new price index for vessels in the
merchant marine and fi!hng fleets also affected
the 1870 estimates, making the new ones lower than

the old ones. Much more important however, is the
fact that I have now re—worked the 1870 estimates

of nan—farm residences and of the capital of the
"trade" sector (the "other industrial" sector, in

Kuznetss (1946) terminology). The new estimates

were adopted as the result of tests based on
evidence supplied by Lee Soltow (1975), evidence

that was not available to Howle and me when we
constructed

our

original

series.

The

new

estimating procedures are very much stranger than

the old ones were, and a test

for internal

consistency provides strong support

for

the

results. Nonetheless one cannot be sure that the

new estimates are actually closer to the truth
than were the old ones. Both sets depend upon data
from

a

census

that

under-enumerated

the

population, and probably undercounted property as

34

well (Ransom and Sutch, 1975).. Since the new
estimates are lower than the old ones, it may very

well be that they reflect the true value of the
relevant property less accurately than do the old

estimates, despite the fact that they rest on
technically superior procedures.

Some, but not all, of the changes in the
current price series, described above, affect the
const-nt price series as well.

I also made a few

small alterations in those constant price series
that were built up from counts of physical capital

(e.g. the railroads). More important is the fact

that I made some adjustments to the price index
numbers. Howle and I received many of the price

indexes we used in correspondence with Dorothy
Brady.

In a few cases, Dr. Brady subsequently

revised her figures.

Howle and I also used the

Brady indexes without adjustment, although, in
fact, they did not refer to precisely the dates we
required (see the discussion of this point above).

When I returned to the estimates, I corrected the
price indexes, so that they reflected Dr. Brady's

last word on the subject and so that the indexes

were more nearly relevant to the dates to which
the

censuses refer.

The principal

changes,

substantively, were to raise the 1840 estimates of

agricultural buildings and non-farm residences,

35

and to

lower the estimates of machinery and

equipment in manufacturing, 1890 and 1900, and the
"trade" sector, 1870—1900.

Of these alterations,

the ones referring to 1840 are most doubtful.

In

these cases I was obliged to build up new price
indexes for structures to replace an index number
abandoned bY Dr. Brady.

It may very well be that

my new indexes——based, as they are, on materials

prices and wage rates——actually understate the
price levels of structures in l840. If that is
the case, using these indexes to deflate the 1840

values may have produced an over—statement of
constant price values in that year. However, all
the tests I have run so far suggest that this has

not happened. On balance, the changes I have made

in the constant price series have not been of
overwhelming quantitative significance (in no year

do they amount to more than 10 percent of the
value of the domestic capital stock), but they are

far from negligible, and since the adjustment for

1840 is in an upward direction, and the ones for
l870—l90C' in a downward direction, the rates of
long—term growth are lower when computed with the

new series than when computed with the old one,

even when the two series are put on the same
conceptual basis.

36

The old series,

expressed

in

constant

prices, was never published, but a set of index
numbers based on it appeared in American
Economic Growth: An Economist's History of the

United States (Davis, Easterlin,, Parker et al.,
1972). These index numbers provide the best bases
for comparing the old with the new series.

The comparisons can be made with data in
Table 3, which show that the new series describe

lower long—term rates of growth than do the old
(Panels A and C). The disparities are the wider

when the new series, inclusive of all farm land
improvements (Variant A in the table), is compared

with the old series. That is reasonable
enough,

in view of the conceptual difference

between the two series and the well known fact

that the agricultural sector grew at a slower
pace, over the last six decades of the century,
than did the rest of the economy. But even when
the conceptual difference is removed——the Variant

B series

is

substituted

for

the Variant A

series——the new estimates exhibit somewhat lower

long—term rates of growth than do the old. The
margins are not great, however——less than half a
percentage point in every case, an adjustment of
less than one—tenth in each of the long—term rates

of growth. The data on the decadal rates of growth

show, moreover, that in only two
decades——1840—1850 and 1860—1870——are the
disparities in growth rates at all wide (Panel B).

These are the decadal growth rates that are
affected bY the major estimating changes described

above, of course.

It should also be pointed out

that the new and old series exhibit the same
patterns of change over time, the rate of growth

rising from 1840—1850 to 1850—1860, falling to
1860—1870,

rising

again

to

1870—1880

and

1880—1890, and finally falling to 1890—1900.

On the whole1 then, the new series differ

from the old in important respects, but once
allowance is made for differences in concept and

coverage, they appear to tell roughly the same
story with respect to the rate of growth of the
capital stock.

(The subject is treated further,

below.

When Howle and I first came to this topic
there were in the field two sets of comprehensive
capital

stoci.:: estimates covering a substantial

part of the nineteenth century, Simon Kuznets's
series, reported in National Product since
1869 (1946), which cover the years 1880, 1890, and

1900, and Raymond Goldsmith's revisions to the
Kuzriets figures and extension of them to 1850,
reported in Income and Wealth, Series II (1952).

(See, also, Kuznets, 1961,

and Kendrick, 1961.) Finally, there were a number
of helpful independent pieces of work, some of

them developed in connection with the Volume 24

Since then the research of Soltow (1975) and Weiss

(1967) has provided additional materials that I
have found helpful.

Howle and I began with Kuznets's National

Product since 1869 (1946), which provided us with

the framework within which we have subsequently
worked.

The volume contains very detailed

estimates, together with full descriptions of
estimating procedures. Our idea was to modify
Kuznets's estimates in light of the work: that had
come forward since National Product since 1869 was

published, and to extend the

estimates to the

years 1840, 1850, 1860, and 1870. The Goldsmith

41

(1952) estimates for 1850, while available in less
detail, were to serve as an ante—bellum benchmark.

The extent to which the new Gallman-Howle
series now deviate from the Kuznets and Goldsmith

estimates is exhibited in Table 4.
seen that

It will be

in the cases of fixed reproducible

capital in farming, street railroads, shipping,
canals, river improvements, and pipelines and in

the cases of inventories of farm livestock and
monetary metals,

the differences are slight (in

the cases of street railroads and pipelines there

are none at all).

For the rest, there are

substantial differences.

As they relate to the

Kuznets and Gailman—Howle estimates, they tend to

cancel out, so that the values of aggregate fixed

reproducible capital fall within ten percent of
each other in each year, the K:uznets figures being

the higher.

The net gaps between the Goldsmith

and the new Gailman—Howle estimates are wider and

they also run in opposite directions in 1850 and

the later years,

Thus the Goldsmith series

describes a substantially higher rate, of growth

across the nineteenth century than does the
Gailman—Howle series, even when differences of
concept and coverage are eliminated.'6
The differences between our work and that of
Goldsmith and Kuznets have emerged in part because

42

we had available evidence unavailable to them, in

part because we have interpreted some of the
evidence available to all of us in a new way, and

in part because we have adopted, here and there,
different concepts. In the cases of the estimates

relating to agriculture, the "other industrial"
(or "trade") sector, non—farm residences, steam

railroads, telephones, canals and river
improvements, electric power and light,
irrigation, tax—exempt property, and international

claims, we were the beneficiaries of substantial
amounts of research that came forward only after

Goldsmith and Kuznets had published.

We did a

certain amount of new research particularly with
respect to inventories and the telegraph, and we
worked

out

new interpretations

of

existing

evidence in a number of places, notably in the
cases of mining and manufacturing (we believe that

rented real estate was inadvertently left out of

Kuznetss manufacturing estimates). Finally, in a

number of cases (e.g., steam railroads, the
telegraph) we chose to substitute estimates of net
reproduction cost for bool.:: value.

In summary, then, the new Gallman—Howle
capital stoci.:: estimates are net of retirements and

net of capital consumption. While a few of the
components (current prices) are expressed in book

43

values, most are in

market prices

or

in net

reproduction costs. Conceptually, the new series

The same is true with respect to

According to Goldsmith, domestic capital 46
(reproducible tangible assets, narrow definition),

in current prices, increased at an average annual

rate of 5.79 percent between 1901 and 1929, 5.00

percent between 1930 and 1953, and 8.20 percent

between 1954 and l80. These are, on the whole,
higher rates of change than are exhibited bY the

Gallman—Howle series over

similarly extended

periods (see Table 5), and this is true whether

one looks at the Variant A or the Variant 9
series. The explanation, lies in the price

history of the two centuries. While prices rose
and fell dramatically in both the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, the long—term drift in the

former period was neither powerfully upward nor
powerfully downward.

That is not true of the

twentieth century, however. Prices moved strongly
upward,

on average,

between 1901

and 1929,

1930—1953, and 1953—1980. Thus, deflating on the
base 1929, one finds that the real capital stock

increased at rates of only 3.60 percent, 1.68
percent, and 3.60 percent, in the three periods,

lower than most of the rates exhibited in Table
l9 Over the full sweep of the years 1900 through
1980, the current price series rose 6.36 percent

per year, on average, while the corstant price
series increased only 2.80 percent, the former.

of improvements to farm land (Table A-4 in Gallrnan (1966)).

I assume that average annual improvements, 1849—1858, were

equal to improvements in 1859. Constant price improvements
(Table A-4 in Gailman (1966)) were converted to current

prices by means of the price index of agricultural land
improvements (exclusive of structures) implicit in the data

underlying Table A, below. I assumed that the value of
improvements (current and constant prices) in 1839 and
1849 were equal to the mean value, 1934-1843 and 1844-1854,
respectively.

substantially higher arid the latter substantially

lower than the long—term nineteenth century rates
(see Table 5).

Comparing the experiences of the

two centuries, then, we find marked retardation of
the rate of growth of the real magnitudes, just as
had been previously discovered with respect to the
real national product (Gallman, 1966).
By

the

standard

of

twentieth century

experience, the capital stock grew rapidly

between 1840 and 1900. My guess is that further

work will show that it also grew rapidly by the
standard of what had gone before. But what of the
third standard mentioned above that of experience
in other places?

I am not yet in a position to

make meaningful direct comparisons of this type,
but a fairly obvious indirect one can be made. We
know that the U.S. real national product increased

between the 1830's and 1900 at an exceptionally
high rate, the judgment resting on observations
for

many

countries

(Galiman,

1966;

Davis,

Easterlin, Parker et al., 1972, Cl,. 2). Unless the

rates of change of capital stocks and national
products

diverged

widely——which

is

highly

improbable——the U.S. capital stock must also have
grown rapidly, compared with experience elsewhere.

That means that the U.S. capital stock was
probably a relatively young one, with a high

51

proportion of the stock embodying best—practice
techniques (Galiman (1978)).

In fact, the data of Table 5 show that the

capital stock actually grew faster

than the

national product, in both current and constant
prices, in both variants, over long periods and
over most of the short periods identified in the
table.

That fact •has a rather important set of

implications. But before considering them, it will

pay us to look at other aspects of the evidence in
the table.

Rates of change of both Variants A and B of

the capital stock are contained in Table 5.

It

will be observed that the rates of change of the
Variant B series are always at least as large as
the rates of change of the Variant A series, and
usually larger. One should recall that the Variant

A series includes investment in agricultural land
clearing,

fencing,

and

the

construction

of

drainage and irrigation ditches, while the Variant

B series does not. The Variant A series grew the
more slowly because this component of the capital
stock increased at a below—average pace. This, in
turn, was a consequence both of the fact that the

value of improvements of this type (measured in
reproduction

costs)

constituted

a

declining

fraction of the value of the agricultural capital

52

stock (in both current and constant prices), and

of the fact that the agr icultural
sector——including the capital stock thereof——grew

more slowly than the rest of the economy.

The

former development reflected both a slowing in the

rate (percentage) at which agricultural land was

being added to the stock and the continued high
rates of increase of the stocks of agricultural
structures and equipment, particularly the latter.

Agriculture was becoming more highly mechanized.
A

second

feature of

the

table worth

remarking is that the rates of growth recorded
therein exhibit,

on

the

whole,

a

downward

long—term movement. This is true of both of the
GNP series, in current and constant prices, both
of the capital series, in current prices, and the
Variant B series, in constant prices. The Variant

A series, in constant prices, is only a moderate'
exception.

It exhibits lower rates of growth for

the periods 1860—1900 and 1870—1900 than for
1840—1860, which makes it consistent with the
Variant B and GNP series, but if the peribd is
broken into three equal lengths, the Variant A

series shows equal. rates of growth for 1840—1850

and 1880—1900, the rate for the period 1860—1880
being considerably lower. This is the one bit of
evidence running against a conclusion of general

53

retardation in rates of growth across the latter
part of the nineteenth century. The exception is
not a very important one, however, in view of the

reservations expressed above concerning the 1880
capital stock figure.
date

is,

indeed,

If the estimate for that

biased

then

downward,

an

appropriate adjustment would remove this one
exception to the general finding of retardation in

the rates of growth of the GNP and the capital

stock, a development begun in the nineteenth
century and continued in the twentieth.

A third piece of information emerging from
the table is that the decade—to—decade variations
in the rates of growth of the GNP and the capital
stock

are

reasonably

consistent.

Thus

the

long—swing boom of the 1850's clearly emerges from

the record provided bY Table 5, rates of growth

rising above the levels attained in the 1840's

(exception: the current price GNP Variant B
series), while the rates of change of all series
drop sharply in the Civil War decade, l860_l870.20

Between 1870 and 1880 the rates of change of the
current price series continue to fall, reflecting
the price deflation of the period, while the rates

of change of the real series all rise.

All of

these variations are reassuring. They correspond
to what one might have expected, from a

54

knowledge of the qualitative history of the period
and of quantitative studies of a micro variety. It

is also reasonable to expect the rates of change

of the GNP and capital stock series to move
together as they do. These features of the table
thus enhance one's confidence in the capital stock

series, but (necessarily) offer no new insights
into the period.

The consistency in the movements of the
rates of change of the two sets of series ends
with 1880. Thereafter, the rate of growth of the

GNP series, expressed in constant prices, falls.

persistently, while the rate, of growth of the
current price series falls and, then rises. The
rates of change of the current and constant price

stock series follow neither. of these patterns,
rising betwen 1880 and 1890, and falling between
1890 arid 1900.

Thus the variations in the rates

of growth of the GNP and capital stock series

diverge across the last two decades of the
century. Once again, if the capital stock estimate

for 1880 is, indeed, too low, adjusting it might

bring the patterns of change of the two series
more nearly into line.

Sources of Growth

55

Finally, the data in Table 5 offer the
opportunity to re—work the "sources of

growth"

calculations that I derived on the basis of the
old Gailman and Howleseries and presented on two

earlier occasions (Davs, Parker, Easterlin et
al., (1982); Gallman (1980)). The results of

this

reworking, together with the old figures, appear
in Table 6,

In making my revisions I have left

everything unchanged from the earlier set of
calculations, with the following exceptions:

in

the case of the new calculations based on the
Variant B series, I re—computed the contributions

Table 6 (continued)

Var. A and B," were taken from Davis, Easterlin, Parker, et al.,
1972 ,

underlying them or were computed from these tables or their
underlying data.
The "Productivity" figures in Panel A were taken as residuals.
The data in Panel A labelled "Capital Stock, Var. A and B"

were derived by weighting rates of change with appropriate

income share weights. The rates of change were taken from
Table 5, above, (in the case of Panel A, Part I) or were
computed by subtracting the rate of change of

population from the rate of change in Table 5 (in the case of

Panel A, Part II). The income share weight for the Variant
B series (.19) was taken from the notes to Table 2.12 of Davis,

Easterljn, Parker et al. (1972). The income share weight for
the Variant A capital serie.s (.26) was computed by raising the

Variant B weight in the same proportion as the Variant A capital
stock figure (current prices) exceeds the Variant B

figure, in 1860. The average annual rate of change of the
Variant A land supply figure was computed from Historical
Statistics (1960) ,

Series K-2, .1850—1900. The incOme

share weight (.06) was computed by subtracting the capital
stock weight (.26) from the sum of the land and capital stock
weights (.32) employed for the Variant B calculations.

59

series leads to the conclusion that productivity

change accounted for almost six-tenths of the
growth of per capita N.N.P. in the nineteenth
century. This is lower than the figure recorded
for the twentieth century (almost eight—tenths),

but is by no means low. Theterm "productivity"
covers, of course, the influences of a multitude

of forces operating on c'utput. Perhaps a more

meaningful way to put the conclusion is to say

that the calculations in Table 6 (Variant A)
assign to the factor inputs narrowly defined,
responsibility for only a little more than two—
fifths of the increase in per capita real national

product across the last six decades of the
nineteenth century.

The role of other forces,

therefore, cannot be regarded as small.

Capital/Output Ratios

The capital stock increased faster than the

national product, according to the data of Table
5.

This means that the capital/output ratio was

rising;

the economy was engaged

in capital

deepening. Table 7 is organized to describe this

process. The data leave something to be desired
because, for the period before the Civil War, the

ratios depend upon data referring to individual

61

Years. The ratios, therefore, are influenced by

events peculiar to these Years and may not be
fully representative of the period, 1840—1860. The

post—war estimates are less susceptible to this

criticism, since the national product data are
decade averages, centered roughly on the Years to

which the capital stock figures refer (see the
notes to the table). One should remember, also,
that the estimates are not equally reliable; those
for 1840, 1870, and 1880 rest on capital

stock data that are probably less strong than the

data for the other years. Differences in ratios
between one Year and the next should not be given
undue importance.

It is the general drift of the

ratios that should be the focus of our interest.

The aggregate capital/output ratios (first
two columns) do, in fact, rise over time, and this

is true of both the Variant A and Variant B
series, in current and: constant prices. The

Variant A ratios are much larger than the Variant

B ratios,

The

Variant A ratios also rise less rapidly than the

ratios,

reflecting

the

declining

63

capital, accounting for over two—thirds of the
value of the stock in constant prices, by 1900
their share had

fallen

to about a third. Machinery

and equipment, composing barely one—twentieth of

the stock (constant prices) in 1840, were over
one—quarter of the stock in 1900. Accompanying the

capital deepening there was, then, a substantial
re—shaping of the stoci.::, with new forms of capital

rising to prominence.

The last four columns of the table also
throw some light on the nature of the decline in

the capital/output ratio between 1860 and 1875.
Changes in the ratios of inventories, equipment,
and "other improvements" to output clearly are not

responsible. The first rose moderately, in both
current and constant prices, whereas the other two

either changed very little (equipment, in current
prices),

or

rose

vigorously

(equipment,

in

constant prices; "other improvements," in constant

prices "other improvements", in current prices).

But the ratio of "farm improvements" to GNP
declined very sharply (especially in current
prices) and played a major role in the observed

capital shallowing for the economy as a whole.
This development may reflect the effects of the
Civil War.

In the South, some improved land was

allowed to return to nature during the War, while

65

trade.

In

any

case,

this

phenomenon also played a role in the decline of the
capital/output ratio between 1860 and 1875 (Williamson,
1974).

An indication of the importance of this matter is
easily obtained. The sum of the ratios in the last four

columns of the table in each Year approximates the

Variant A ratio of domestic capital to GNP.

The

difference between this sum and the value in the first
column measures the effec.t of net claims on foreigners

on the national capital/output ratio. The sums and the
entries from column for 1860 and 1875 are as follows:

The sums are almost identical with the first column

column values in 1875. More to the point, in
constant prices the sums are almost the same in
the two years, while in current prices the 1875

sum is only moderately below the 1860 sum. The
decline in the aggregate national capital/output
ratio, then, reflects both changes in the

capital/output ratios computed from the former

will show less tendency to rise over time than

will capital/output ratios computed from the
latter. That must be borne in mind when Tables 7
and 8 are compared.22

I begin with three sectors: agriculture;
mining, manufacturing and hand trades; all other
private business. The estimates forthese sectors
are relatively strong (that is, compared with the

estimates on which the other ratios in the table
depend), the capital and value added estimates are

independent, in each case, and the sectors are

sufficiently broad so that one can hope for a
modicum of stability in the ratios.

All of the series, e>cept for agriculture,
Variant A, show quite pronouncedupward movements
over time.

The Variant A series shows no very

clear trend, in either current or constant prices.

The Variant B series and the ratios for the "all

other private business" sector rise strongly
before the Civil War, flatten out between 1860 and

1880, and then rise again strongly, while the
"mining, manufacturing, and hand trades, sector

exhibits a ratio that neither rises nor falls"
bef6re the War, but increases strongly from 1860
to 1900, in both current and constant prices.

It

would be fair to say, then, that the upward

73

residences, farm and non—farm. Since the capital
stock series do not distinguish farm residences, I

was obliged to include all farm buildings in the
numerator, which means that all of the ratios for

this sector are biased upward. Furthermore, the
denominator was initially estimated on the basis

of capital stock data (see Galimari and Weiss,

(1969)), although not the capital stock data
appearing in the numerators of these ratios. Thus

the ratios cannot be taken very seriously.

I

include them for the sake of completeness arid
because the data do figure, in another form1 in
Table 7, and the reader is therefore entitled to
know something about them.

Whether or riot the estimating procedures

were proper (for the purpose of measuring the
capital/output ratio), the relationships obtained

between value added and the capital stock of the
"residences" sector are plausible. Reversing the
ratios and adding land to residential capital, we

have estimates of the rate of return (gross) to
residential property.

The computed rate follows

fairly closely the pattern of the interest rate
(at least from 1860 onward), a result which might
have been anticipated on theoretical grounds. Thus
at' least the value added and capital stoci.:: data

for this sector seem consistent.

75

the data exclude certain types of capital.

But

that is certainly not all there is to it.

The

residential

and

transportation

utilities sectors were,

and

public

in fact, more capital

intensive than were the secondary sectors, far
example.

Since the structure of the economy was

changing in important ways, the level of the
aggregate capital/output ratio may have been
influenced bY the shifting relative importance of
the various sectors. Lines 6 (a)—(d) and 7(a)—(d)
were computed to help settle that issue. The lines

contain various weighted average capital/output
ratios, sets of calculations appearing for both

Variant A and B estimates, and for both all
sectors

and

"residences" sector. .

and

sectoral

capital/output ratios were allowed to vary over
time; in the other (6(c) and (d); 7(c) and (d)),

capital/output ratios were held constant, while
value added weights were allowed to change over
time.

The first set of calculations shows the

effects of rising sectorl ratios on the aggregate
ratio, no allowance being made for the effects of

structural changes.

In the second set, only

77

change that worked against the downward movement
of the overall ratio was the growing relative size
of the transportation and public utilities sector,

with its exceptionally large capital/output ratio.
All

of

these structural

developments were

inter—related: all were part

of the general

process of modernization, which consisted of the
transfer of economic activities into the orbit of

the market, increasing specialization and trade,

consisted of agricultural land improvements, many

These works were typically carried out in the off

season--in the spaces in •the agricultural year
when there were no pressing tasks——e.g., planting
or harvesting—-associated with the growing crops.
Little external finance was required to carry them
out.

on constant price data.

It should be said,

however, that even the constant price estimates

leave something to be desired, in view of the
moderately ambiguous conceptual character of the
stock estimates (see Section 2, above).

In the second procedure, net investment
flows are estimated bY subtracting from gross
investment flows (Galiman, 1960, p. 34) the value

of capital consumption (Table 9, Col (5)).

The

latter can be estimated from the capital stock

data, given estimates of the average age and
useful life of the various components of the
depreciable capital stock. The flow data are of
such a character that investment proportions can

be estimated for

possible to generate gross investment shares, in
which the measurement of gross investment depends

exclusively on stock data (Table 9, Col (3), Ccl,

made directly from the flow data (Table 9, Col

83

from the flow data (Col (5)) than from the stock

data (Cols (1), (2), and (4)), however, and from

The explanation is not far to

seek: the rising depreciable capital/output ratio
meant that, ceteris paribus, the share of capital

consumption in national product was rising.

But

other things were riot,

structure of the depreciable capital stock was

the

machinery

and

increased the share of national product accounted
for by capital consumption.

These two developments meant that the share

of the GNP (concept adopted by Gailman (1960))
accounted for

bY gross investment more than

doubled between the 1840's and 1890's.

One must

further remember that the forms of investment and
their relationships with the market were changing.

The following discussion was developed with

to

apply to

inventories and

international claims, with two exceptions:

It

the series and 51 from the last;

the Gallman and

Howle series, on 1860, 20 years from the first
Year in that series and 40 Years from the last.

Throughout I use the dating scheme relevant

to the capital stock series (1840,

1850, etc.).

Notice that the GNP series is dated to different
Years than these, the disparity being Particularly
wide in the case of the first po.t—Cjvj1 War date.

The reconciliation between the two series is by no

means perfect; the upward movement of the ratio

from 1879

to 1889 is more than negligible.

Nonetheless, the long—term trend is much reduced

in the second tabulation, as compared with the
first, and the variations from one year to the
next are not large, ic, the cortte>t of the obsqrv:ed

annual changes in GNP.

If the measure of capital employed here had

included inventories, this result might have been
different.

The

indirect

effects,

through changing

supply and demand conditions for capital goods,
constitute another matter. The rapid expansion in
the

stock

of

machinery

and

equipment,

for

example——a development that, we have seen, played

a role in the rise of the overall capital/output
ratio——was related to the revolutionary growth of
the industrial sector (mining, manufacturing, hand
trades).
