    "abstract": "\n\nWe present results from experiments containing incentivized school-choice scenarios. In these scenarios, we vary whether schools\u2019 assessments of students are based on a common priority (inducing correlation in admissions decisions) or are based on independent assessments (eliminating correlation in admissions decisions). The quality of students\u2019 application strategies declines in the presence of correlated admissions: application strategies become substantially more aggressive and fail to include attractive \u201csafety\u201d options. We provide a battery of tests suggesting that this phenomenon is at least partially driven by correlation neglect, and we discuss implications for the design and deployment of student-to-school matching mechanisms.\n\n",
