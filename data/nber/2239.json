    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper analyzes a reputational equilibrium for inflation under the generic assumption that monetary policy reflects proximate preferences for low expected inflation and positive unexpected inflation. The paper stresses the qualitative implication that in a reputational equilibrium the policymaker behaves as if it is concerned about controlling inflation, even though it does not have a direct preference for a low actual inflation rate. The analysis also shows how the sovereign's prospects for survival and the private agents' memory process play critical roles in determining whether the reputational equilibrium approximates a hypothetical equilibrium with binding commitments.\n\n",
