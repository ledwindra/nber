The Making Of A Great Contraction With A Liquidity Trap and A Jobless Recovery

NBER Working Paper No. 18544
November 2012
JEL No. E24,E31,E32,E52
ABSTRACT
The great contraction of 2008 pushed the U.S. economy into a protracted liquidity trap (i.e., a long
period with zero nominal interest rates and inflationary expectations below target). In addition, the
recovery was jobless (i.e., output growth recovered but unemployment lingered). This paper presents
a model that captures these three facts. The key elements of the model are downward nominal wage
rigidity, a Taylor-type interest-rate feedback rule, the zero bound on nominal rates, and a confidence
shock. Lack-of-confidence shocks play a central role in generating jobless recoveries, for fundamental
shocks, such as disturbances to the natural rate, are shown to generate recessions featuring recoveries
with job growth. The paper considers a monetary policy that can lift the economy out of the slump.
Specifically, it shows that raising the nominal interest rate to its intended target for an extended period
of time, rather than exacerbating the recession as conventional wisdom would have it, can boost inflationary
expectations and thereby foster employment.

Introduction

The great contraction of 2008 pushed the U.S. economy into a protracted liquidity trap, that
is, into a long period with zero nominal interest rates and long-run inflationary expectations
below target. A second important characteristic of the great contraction is that the recovery
in output growth was swift but jobless, in the sense that unemployment lingered long after
output growth had returned to normal. Figure 1 documents these two facts. In response to

the crisis, the Federal Reserve began easing in late 2007 and by 2008 had brought the federal
funds rate to near zero. Even though the recession was officially declared over in 2009:Q2,
interest rates have remained at zero. The reason the monetary authority has continued to
set rates at their lowest possible level is that employment has not yet recovered. Prior to
the contraction, the civilian-employment-to-population ratio was 62.5 percent. During the
recession it fell by 4 percentage points to 58.5 percent. The recession is regarded as jobless
1

because this ratio has remained at roughly the level it reached at the trough of the recession.
The present paper presents a theoretical model that captures the joint occurrence of
an economic contraction, a protracted liquidity trap, and a jobless recovery. The main elements of the model are downward nominal wage rigidity, a Taylor-type interest-rate feedback
rule, the zero bound on nominal interest rates, and a negative confidence shock. Benhabib,
Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe (2001) showed that the combination of a Taylor rule and the zero
lower bound on nominal rates can give rise to self-fulfilling deflations ending in a liquidity
trap. Our starting point is the observation that the Benhabib et al. model predicts a disconnect between the behavior of nominal variables and the performance of the labor market.
Specifically, the Benhabib et al. model is based on the standard sticky-price new Keynesian
framework. This model predicts that the liquidity trap is associated with about the same
level of employment as the intended steady state. This prediction is at odds with the empirical regularity that liquidity traps are associated with sizable involuntary unemployment.
The present paper makes a step toward overcoming the difficulty of the new Keynesian
sticky-price model to account for both the emergence of involuntary unemployment and a
jobless recovery when the economy is in a liquidity trap. To this end, the paper generalizes
the model of downward nominal wage rigidity and a non-Walrasian labor market developed
in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2011). These two features deliver the result that liquidity traps
give rise to involuntary unemployment. The basic mechanism is that when the economy falls
into a deflationary spiral, nominal wage growth exceeds nominal price growth generating real
wages that are too high to be compatible with full employment. Once the economy is stuck
in the liquidity trap, there is no inherent mechanism capable of bringing real wages down to
their full-employment level. In this way, unemployment becomes a chronic phenomenon. In
particular, technological progress eventually helps output growth to recover, but is unable
to stimulate employment.
We have discussed the importance of downward nominal wage rigidity, the Taylor rule,
and the zero bound for generating liquidity traps with jobless recoveries. The fourth element
of our model, namely, a confidence shock is also essential to capture the patterns shown in
figure 1. The reason is that if the initial impulse is a nonfundamental decline in inflationary
expectations, the Taylor rule, by aggressively lowering interest rates in response to a fall in
current inflation, validates, through the Fisher effect, the expectations of lower future rates
of inflation. In turn, low rates of inflation and downward wage rigidity drive real wages up to
levels associated with involuntary unemployment. Our emphasis on the role of a confidence
shock to explain the great contraction appears to be supported by the data. Aruoba and
Schorfheide (2012) estimate, using a version of the Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe
(2001) model, that in 2008:Q4 the U.S. economy suffered a nonfundamental confidence shock
2

and switched to a self-fulfilling liquidity trap equilibrium. Furthermore, they estimate that
the economy was expected to stay in that equilibrium for several quarters.
The equilibrium dynamics implied by our model are quite different in response to fundamental shocks. When inflationary expectations are well anchored (i.e., in the absence of
confidence shocks), inflationary expectations converge quickly to the central bank’s intended
inflation target as the negative fundamental shock fades away. As inflation converges to
its target level, it erodes the real purchasing power of wages, fostering employment. Consequently, in our model the recovery from a contraction driven by fundamental shocks is
characterized by both an increase in output growth and, more importantly, job creation. We
illustrate how the economy responds to a fundamental shock by characterizing the effect of
an exogenous fall in the natural rate. This shock is of interest because it has been extensively
used in the recent literature on liquidity traps (e.g., Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003).
An important policy challenge is how to revive job creation in an economy that is stuck in
a liquidity trap. Most academic and professional economists agree that an essential element
to bring an economy out of a liquidity trap is to raise inflationary expectations (see, for
example, Krugman, 1998; Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003; Woodford 2012). However, what
policy is able to raise inflationary expectations in a liquidity trap depends upon the nature of
the shock that pushed the economy into the liquidity trap in the first place. Eggertsson and
Woodford show that if the underlying shock is fundamental (in particular a fall in the natural
rate) then inflationary expectations can be lifted by promising to keep nominal rates at zero
for an extended period of time, even after the shock has dissipated. This prescription,
however, could be counterproductive if the root cause of the slump is a nonfundamental
confidence shock. In this situation, a promise of low interest rates for a prolonged period of
time would only validate deflationary expectations and in this way perpetuate the slump.
The reason a policy of low interest rates for an extended period of time cannot generate
expected inflation when the liquidity trap is the result of a confidence shock is that in
these circumstances the negative relationship between nominal interest rates and inflationary
expectations—a central economic relationship that economists and the general public alike
hold as timeless truths—ceases to be valid and might indeed reverse sign. During normal
times, that is, when the economy is not suffering from a lack-of-confidence shock, the primary
effect of an increase in nominal interest rates is a decline in inflationary expectations via a
fall in aggregate demand. Similarly, under normal circumstances, a reduction of the nominal
interest rate tends to boost short-run inflationary expectations through an elevated level
of aggregate spending. In sharp contrast, in a liquidity trap driven by lack of confidence,
the sign is reversed. Low interest rates are not accompanied by high levels of inflation but
rather by falling and even negative inflation. Moreover, because the economy is already
3

inundated by liquidity, a fall in interest rates has no longer a stimulating effect on aggregate
demand. The experience of Japan in the past two decades as well as the recent economic
performance of the United States and other developed countries seems to suggest that zero
nominal interest rates are not doing much to push expected inflation higher (see the top
right panel of figure 1). An insight that emerges from our model is that the reversal of sign
in the relationship between interest rates and expected inflation also operates in the upward
direction. That is, that in a liquidity trap caused by a confidence shock, an increase in
nominal rates tends to raise inflationary expectations without further depressing aggregate
spending. It follows from this insight that any policy that is to succeed in raising inflationary
expectations during an expectations-driven liquidity trap must be associated with an increase
in nominal rates.
Accordingly, this paper presents an interest-rate based strategy for escaping liquidity
traps. Specifically, this strategy stipulates that when inflation falls below a threshold, the
central bank temporarily deviates from the traditional Taylor rule by pegging the nominal
interest rate at the target level. The paper shows that this policy, rather than exacerbating
the recession as conventional wisdom would have it, can boost inflationary expectations and
thereby lift the economy out of the slump.
The present investigation is related to a recent paper by Shimer (2012) who shows that
in a real search model with real wage rigidity, recoveries can be jobless. Our model differs
from Shimer’s in two important aspects. First, our model assumes that nominal wages
are downwardly rigid, but real wages are flexible. The assumption of nominal rather than
real wage rigidity is motivated by an empirical literature suggesting that the former type of
rigidity is pervasive in the United States (see, for instance, Gottschalk, 2005; Basu, Barattieri,
and Gottschalk, 2010; Daly, Hobijn, and Lucking; 2012). Second, in real models of jobless
recoveries, monetary policy plays no role by construction. By contrast, a central prediction of
our formulation is that monetary policy plays a crucial role in determining whether a recovery
is jobless or not. Indeed, there is empirical evidence showing that the stance of monetary
policy does matter for labor-market outcomes in recoveries. Calvo, Coricelli, and Ottonello
(2012) study recessions and recoveries from financial crises in developed and developing
countries and find that recoveries tend to be jobless when inflation is low. Furthermore, they
find that employment grows and real wages fall in high-inflation recoveries. Our model is
consistent with both of these empirical findings.
Our analysis is also related to the work of Mertens and Ravn (2012). These authors
study the size of fiscal multipliers in a version of the Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe
(2001) model. They find that the size of the fiscal multiplier associated with a particular
fiscal instrument depends on the type of shock that pushed the economy into the liquidity
4

trap. In particular, they show that, contrary to what happens when the liquidity trap
is caused by a fundamental shock, when the liquidity trap is due to a nonfundamental
shock, then supply-side fiscal instruments have a large multiplier, whereas demand-side fiscal
instruments have a small multiplier. Aruoba and Schorfheide (2012) also find that demandside fiscal instruments are less effective in stimulating the economy in a confidence-shockinduced liquidity trap.
The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 presents the model.
Section 3 shows that the model possesses two steady states, one with zero unemployment and
inflation equal to its target level, and one with involuntary unemployment and zero nominal
rates. Section 4 shows that a lack-of-confidence shock leads to a recession, a liquidity trap,
and a jobless recovery. Section 5 shows that in response to a fundamental decline in the
natural rate, the recovery features job creation. Section 6 shows that raising nominal rates
can lift the economy out of a confidence-shock induced liquidity trap without any initial
costs in terms of output or unemployment. Section 7 concludes.

The Model

We develop a model of a closed economy with monetary nonneutrality due to downward
nominal wage rigidity. The formulation of wage rigidity follows Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2011). This friction opens the door to involuntary unemployment in response to any shock
that leads to a significant deceleration in the growth rate of the full-employment nominal
wage. We model monetary policy as a Taylor-type interest-rate feedback rule with a lower
bound at zero.

Households

The economy is populated by a large number of infinitely-lived households with preferences
described by the utility function

t=0

where Ct denotes consumption, ξt is an exogenous taste shock following an AR(1) process
with mean zero,
U (C) ≡ [C 1−σ − 1]/(1 − σ)
is a utility index with σ > 0, β ∈ (0, 1) is a subjective discount factor, and Et is the
expectations operator conditional on information available in period t.
5

Households are assumed to be endowed with a constant number of hours, h̄, which they
supply inelastically to the labor market. Because of the presence of nominal wage rigidities,
households will in general only be able to work ht ≤ h̄ hours each period. Households take
ht as exogenously determined. They pay nominal lump-sum taxes in the amount Tt and
receive nominal profits from the ownership of firms, denoted Φt . Households can purchase
nominally risk-free government bonds, denoted Bt , which when held from period t to period
t + 1 earn a gross nominal interest rate of Rt . The budget constraint of the household is
then given by
Pt Ct + Bt = Wtn ht + Rt−1 Bt−1 + Φt − Tt ,

(2)

where Pt denotes the nominal price level in period t and Wtn denotes the nominal wage rate.
In period t, the household takes the right-hand side of the budget constraint as exogenously
given.
In each period t ≥ 0, the optimization problem of the household consists in choosing
Ct and Bt to maximize (1) subject

where πt+1 ≡ Pt+1 /Pt denotes the gross rate of inflation between periods t and t + 1.

2.2

Firms

Consumption goods are produced using labor as the sole input via the technology
Yt = Xt F (ht ),
where
F (h) = hα ,
with α ∈ (0, 1), Yt denotes output, and Xt is a deterministic trend in productivity that grows
at the constant gross rate µ ≥ 1, that is,
Xt = µXt−1 .

6

The firm operates in competitive product and labor markets. Profits, denoted Φt , are given
by
Φt = Pt Xt F (ht ) − Wtn ht .
The firm chooses ht to maximize profits. The optimality condition associated with this
problem is
Wn
Xt F 0 (ht ) = t .
Pt
This first-order condition implicitly defines the firm’s demand for labor. It states that firms
are always on their labor demand curve. Put differently, in this model firms never display
unfilled vacancies nor are forced to keep undesired positions. As we will see shortly, this will
not be the case for workers, who will sometimes be off their labor supply schedule and will
experience involuntary unemployment.

2.3

Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity

Nominal wages are assumed to be downwardly rigid. Specifically, in any given period nominal wages can at most fall by a factor γ(ut ) ≥ 0, where ut denotes the aggregate rate of
unemployment. Formally, we impose that
n
.
Wtn ≥ γ(ut )Wt−1

This setup nests the cases of absolute downward rigidity, when γ(ut ) ≥ 1 for all ut , and
full wage flexibility, when γ(ut ) = 0 for all ut . We impose the following assumption on the
function γ(.):
Assumption 1. The function γ(ut ) satisfies
γ 0 (ut ) < 0,
and
γ(0) > β̃µ,
where β̃ ≡ βµ−σ .
The first condition in assumption 1 allows for nominal wages to become more flexible
as unemployment increases. The second condition is necessary for the uniqueness of the
nonstochastic steady state with full employment and for the existence of a second steady
state with unemployment. In the simulations reported below, we assume that γ(u) takes the

7

form
γ(u) = γ0 (1 − u)γ1 ,
with γ0 , γ1 > 0.
The presence of downwardly rigid nominal wages implies that the labor market will in
general not clear at the inelastically supplied level of hours h̄. Instead, involuntary unemployment, given by h̄ − ht , will be a regular feature of this economy. Actual employment
must satisfy
ht ≤ h̄
at all times. Finally, at any point in time, wages and employment must satisfy the slackness
condition

n
= 0.
(h̄ − ht ) Wtn − γ(ut )Wt−1
This slackness condition implies that whenever there is involuntary unemployment, the lower
bound on nominal wages must be binding. It also says that whenever the lower bound on
nominal wages does not bind, the economy must be operating at full employment.

2.4

The Government

We assume that the government levies lump-sum taxes in the amount Tt , issues public debt,
denoted Bt , and consumes no goods. The sequential budget constraint of the government is
then given by
Bt + Tt = Rt−1 Bt−1 .
We assume that lump-sum taxes are chosen to ensure the government’s solvency at all times
and for any path of the price level. One such fiscal policy would be, for instance, to set Tt
endogenously at a level such that Bt = 0 for all t.
Monetary policy takes the form of a Taylor-type feedback rule, whereby the gross nominal
interest rate is set as an increasing function of inflation and the output gap. Specifically, we
assume that the interest-rate rule is of the form

 
Yt
∗
∗
,
Rt = max 1, R + απ (πt − π ) + αy ln
Yt∗
where π ∗ denotes the gross inflation target, and R∗ , απ , and αy are positive coefficients. The
variable Yt∗ denotes the flexible-wage level of output. That is,
Yt∗ = Xt h̄α .

8

The interest-rate rule is bounded below by unity to satisfy the zero bound on nominal interest
rates. We introduce the following assumption involving the parameters of the Taylor rule:
Assumption 2. The parameters R∗ , π ∗ , and απ satisfy:
R∗ ≡

π∗
> 1,
β̃

απ β̃ > 1,
and

γ(0)
.
µ
The first two conditions are quite standard. The first one allows the inflation target, π ∗ ,
π∗ >

to be supported as a deterministic steady state equilibrium. Then second one is known as
the Taylor principle and guarantees local uniqueness of equilibrium in the neighborhood of
a steady state with full employment and inflation at target. The third condition is needed
for the existence of a unique steady-state equilibrium with full employment.

2.5

Equilibrium

In equilibrium, the goods market must clear. That is, consumption must equal production
Ct = Xt F (ht ).
To facilitate the characterization of equilibrium, we scale all real variables that display
long-run growth by the deterministic productivity trend Xt . Specifically, let ct ≡ Ct /Xt
and wt ≡ Wtn /(Pt Xt ). Then, the competitive equilibrium is defined as a set of processes
{ct , ht , ut , wt , πt , Rt }∞

We next establish that the present economy possesses two distinct nonstochastic steady-state
equilibria. In one, inflation equals the inflation target π ∗ and unemployment is nil. In the
second steady state, the economy is in a liquidity trap with a zero nominal interest rate and
perpetual unemployment. We refer to the former steady state as the full-employment steady
state and to the latter as the unemployment steady state.
The following proposition establishes existence of a full-employment steady state. It
further shows that there is a unique full-employment steady state.

10

Proposition 1 (Existence of a Full-Employment Steady State). Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied. Then, there exists a unique full-employment steady state (u = 0).
Moreover, at the full-employment steady state the inflation rate equals the inflation target
π∗.
Proof. See Appendix A.
This is the steady state around which the monetary authority wishes to stabilize the
economy. We are interested, however, in the existence of a second, unintended, steady state
featuring chronic unemployment, inflation below target, and a zero nominal interest rate.
The following proposition establishes the existence of such a steady state. It further shows
that the unintended steady state is unique.
Proposition 2 (Existence of an Unemployment Steady State). Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied. Then, there exists a unique unemployment steady state (u = ū >
0). Moreover, at the unemployment steady state the economy is in a liquidity trap (R = 1
and π = β̃ < π ∗ ).
Proof. See Appendix A.
The existence of two nonstochastic steady states, one in which the inflation rate equals
the inflation target and one in which the economy is in a liquidity trap is reminiscent of the
findings reported in Benhabib et al. (2001) with an important difference. The key difference
between the steady states of the present model and those implied by the new Keynesian
model of Benhabib et al. is that in the latter, the unintended steady state features full
employment. The novel implication of the present model is that the unintended steady state
is characterized by involuntary unemployment.

Great Contractions With Jobless Recoveries

In this section, we study equilibria driven by revisions in inflationary expectations. We are
particularly interested in a situation in which, because of a loss of confidence, the rate of
inflation is below the value agents had expected in the previous period. We will show that
such a non-fundamental demand shock results in deflation, unemployment, and zero nominal
interest rates. More importantly, the recovery is jobless in the sense that output growth
returns to normal but unemployment lingers. The interest-rate rule in place, far from jolting
the economy out of the slump, validates expectations of persistent future unemployment and
zero nominal rates.
11

Consider a situation in which prior to period 0 the economy has been in a steady state
with full employment, u−1 = 0, and an inflation rate equal to the policy target, π−1 = π ∗ .
Furthermore, assume that in period −1, agents expected π0 to equal π ∗ . Suppose that in
period 0, a negative revision in agents’ economic outlook causes the rate of inflation π0 to
fall below the expected level π ∗ . Assume that from period 0 on, inflationary expectations
are always fulfilled and that there are no shocks to economic fundamentals.
We first show that a negative confidence shock depresses price growth. More precisely, the
present model predicts that in response to a negative revision in expectations that results in
an initial rate of inflation below target, inflation falls monotonically below a threshold given
by γ(0)/µ < π ∗ and then remains below this threshold forever. In other words, the Taylor
rule in place is unable to ensure the return of inflation to target. The following proposition
formalizes this result.
Proposition 3 (Inflation Dynamics Under Lack of Confidence). Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied and that ξt = 0 and deterministic for t ≥ 0. Further, assume that
π0 < π ∗ . Then, in any perfect foresight equilibrium,
πt+1

for all t ≥ 0.

Furthermore, there exists a finite integer T ≥ 0 such that πT <

γ(0)
.
µ

Proof: See Appendix A.
The significance of the inflation threshold γ(0)/µ is that once inflation falls below it, full
employment becomes impossible. The reason is that because of the downward rigidity of
nominal wages, the ratio γ(0)/πt represents a lower bound on real wage growth under full
employment. If this ratio exceeds the growth rate of productivity, µ, then it must be that real
wages are growing at a rate larger than µ. But under full employment, wages cannot grow
at a rate exceeding µ, since Xt F 0 (h̄) can grow at most at the rate µ. Therefore, if inflation
falls below the threshold γ(0)/µ, the economy must experience involuntary unemployment.
Because the Taylor rule is unable to bring the rate of inflation above the threshold γ(0)/µ,
the presence of unemployment becomes chronic. We establish this result in the following
proposition.
Proposition 4 (Chronic Involuntary Unemployment Under Lack of Confidence).
Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied and that ξt = 0 and deterministic for t ≥ 0.
Further, assume that π0 < π ∗ . Then, in any perfect foresight equilibrium ut > 0 for all
t ≥ T , where T ≥ 0 is the finite integer defined in proposition 3.
12

Proof: See Appendix A.
Given an initial rate of inflation π0 < π ∗ , a perfect-foresight equilibrium can be shown to
exist and to be unique. The following proposition formalizes this result.
Proposition 5 (Existence and Uniqueness of Chronic Unemployment Equilibria).
Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied and that ξt = 0 and deterministic for t ≥ 0.
Further, assume that w−1 = F 0 (h̄). Then, given π0 < π ∗ there exists a unique perfect
foresight equilibrium.
Proof: See Appendix A.
The intuition for the existence of equilibria in which expectations for future increases
in unemployment are self-fulfilling could be as follows. Suppose in period t agents expect
unemployment in period t+1 to be higher. This change in expectations represents a negative
income shock to the household as future labor income is expected to decline. This decline
in income lowers desired consumption in all periods. Lower demand in period t leads to
lower prices in period t. In turn, a decline in current inflation, by the Taylor rule, reduces
the current nominal interest rate. And a lower nominal interest rate, as long as expected
inflation does not fall by as much as the current nominal rate, causes the real interest rate
to decline. The fall in the real interest rate induces a declining path in consumption. In this
way, demand next period is weaker than demand today, validating the initial expectation of
higher future unemployment.
Importantly, if the dynamics triggered by the initial revision in inflationary expectations
converge, the convergence point is the unemployment steady state, characterized in proposition 2, featuring involuntary unemployment and a zero nominal interest rate. The following
proposition states this result more formally.
Proposition 6 (Convergence To A Liquidity Trap With Unemployment). Suppose
assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied and that ξt = 0 and deterministic for t ≥ 0. Further,
assume that π0 < π ∗ . Then, if inflation and unemployment converge, they converge to the
unemployment steady state (π, R, u) = (β̃, 1, ū) of proposition 2.
Proof: See Appendix A.
Clearly, if the economy converges to the unemployment steady state, then in the long
run output grows at the rate µ. This is the same rate of growth as the one observed in the
intended steady state. This means that output growth fully recovers whereas unemployment
does not. It then follows immediately that the present model predicts a jobless recovery.
13

To illustrate the dynamics set in motion by a lack of confidence shock, we simulate a
calibrated version of the model. The simulation also serves to confirm the possibility of
convergence to the unemployment steady state. It is, however, not meant to match actual
data, but simply as an illustration of the analytical results derived thus far. We assume that
a time period is one quarter. We set σ = 2, which is a standard value in the business-cycle
literature. We assume a labor share of 75 percent, which corresponds to setting α = 0.75.
We assign a value of 1.0151/4 to µ, to match the average growth rate of per capita output
in the postwar United States. We set β̃ = 1.04−1/4 , a value consistent with a long-run real
interest rate of 4 percent per year. We normalize the time endowment to unity by setting
h̄ = 1. Following standard parameterizations of Taylor rules in developed countries, we
assume that the central bank has an inflation target of 2 percent per year (π ∗ = 1.021/4 ),
and that the inflation and output coefficients of the interest-rate feedback rule take on the
values suggested in Taylor (1993), that is, απ = 1.5 and αy = 0.125.
Two novel parameters of our model are γ0 and γ1 governing the degree of downward
nominal wage rigidity. We set γ0 = π ∗ . This implies that at the intended steady state,
nominal wages are indexed at a rate at least as large as average inflation π ∗ . We note,
however, that at the intended steady state this constraint is not binding because, due to the
presence of productivity growth, nominal wages grow at the gross rate π ∗ µ > π ∗ . To calibrate
the parameter γ1 governing the elasticity of wage rigidity with respect to unemployment, we
assume that at an unemployment rate of 5 percent nominal wages can fall frictionlessly
by 2 percent per year, that is, we impose the restriction 0.981/4 = γ(0.05). This calibration
restriction is motivated by the observation that during the great contraction of 2008, the peak
unemployment rate, reached in October 2009, was 10 percent, which represents an increase of
5 percent over the average unemployment rate observed in the pre-recession quinquennium.
At the same time, during the great contraction of 2008 nominal hourly compensation costs
in manufacturing did not fall. Our assumption that nominal wages can fall by 2 percent per
year when unemployment is 5 percent lies, therefore, on the conservative side. The implied
value of γ1 is 0.1942.
Figure 2 displays the equilibrium dynamics triggered by a period-0 revision in expectations that results in an initial inflation rate 10 annual basis points below the target rate π ∗ ,
that is π0 = 1.0191/4 . To compute the perfect-foresight equilibrium path, we follow the steps
described in the proof of proposition 5. In particular, we solve for the exact dynamics of the
nonlinear model. The figure shows that after the initial loss of confidence inflation starts
drifting down. As a response, the monetary authority, following the dictum of the Taylor
rule, lowers the nominal interest rate. Agents interpret the lowering of interest rates as a
signal of lower future inflation, that is, the Fisher effect dominates in spite of the strong

Keynesian structure of the model. In turn, these expectations are validated, leading, via
the Taylor rule, to a further round of easing. Initially, because the lower bound on nominal
wages is not binding, the fall in inflation has no effect on the labor market and the economy
continues to operate at full employment. However, after 8 quarters inflation falls below the
threshold γ(0)/µ. At this point the lower bound on nominal wage growth begins to bind and
involuntary unemployment emerges. The presence of unemployment puts additional downward pressure on nominal rates through the output term of the Taylor rule. As time goes
by, the fall in inflation tightens the wage constraint further causing more unemployment.
At some point, the nominal interest rate hits its own lower bound of 0. From this point
on, inflation continues to fall monotonically toward its long-run unintended steady-state
value of β̃. In this deflationary environment, real wages continue to experience undesired
growth causing further employment losses. Consequently, the rate of unemployment increases monotonically and eventually converges to u, which under the present calibration
equals 5.5 percent.1 Unlike the dynamics of inflation and unemployment, the dynamics of

output growth are non-monotonic. Initially, because unemployment grows at an accelerating
rate, output growth falls, reaching a trough in period 19, which coincides with the economy
reaching the liquidity trap. As the rate of unemployment approaches its unintended steadystate level, output growth fully recovers to the rate of technological progress, µ, observed
prior to the recession. However, this recovery is jobless, in the sense that unemployment
remains high at its steady-state value of 5.5 percent. Comparing the dynamics of output
growth, employment, the nominal interest rate, and expected inflation shown in figures 1
and 2 suggests that the predictions of our model are qualitatively in line with actual data.
This finding gives some credence to the hypothesis that the great contraction of 2008 was at
least in part the result of an unanchoring of inflationary expectations in the context of an
economy with downward nominal wage rigidity, a Taylor rule, and a zero bound on nominal
rates. To highlight the importance of nonfundamental loss of confidence shocks in generating
jobless recoveries, we next analyze the dynamics triggered by fundamental shocks.

Contractions with Job-Creating Recoveries

In this section, we characterize unemployment and inflation dynamics when inflationary
expectations are well anchored. By well-anchored inflationary expectations we mean environments in which agents expect inflation to converge toward its target level π ∗ . We show
that when inflationary expectations are well anchored, a large negative fundamental demand
shock, modeled as a decline in the natural rate of interest, causes deflation and unemployment on impact. More importantly the key distinguishing characteristic of the adjustment
when inflationary expectations are well anchored is that recoveries feature both output and
employment growth. This is in sharp contrast to the dynamics triggered by a negative confidence shock, studied in section 4, which are characterized by a jobless recovery and the
expectation that the economy will continue to be afflicted by deflation and unemployment
in the future.
As much of the recent related literature on liquidity traps (e.g., Eggertsson and Woodford,
2003), we focus on disturbances to the natural rate of interest. For analytical tractability,
we limit attention to perfect foresight equilibria. We first characterize the response of the
model economy to purely temporary negative shocks to the natural real rate of interest and
later will consider the response to more persistent shocks. In our theoretical environment,
the natural rate of interest, defined as the real interest rate that would prevail in the absence
of nominal rigidities, is given by β̃ −1 eξt −ξt+1 . A purely temporary negative natural-rate shock
is a situation in which at t = 0, it is unexpectedly learned that ξ0 − ξ1 < 0 and that ξt = ξt+1
for all t ≥ 1. Without loss of generality, we model a temporary decline in the natural rate
16

of interest by setting ξ0 < 0 and ξt = 0 for all t ≥ 1. The path of the natural rate of interest
is then given by β̃ −1 eξ0 < β̃ −1 in period 0, and β̃ −1 for all t > 0.
The following definition provides a precise meaning for the concept of perfect foresight
equilibria with well anchored inflationary expectations in the present context.
Definition 1 (Equilibria With Well-Anchored Inflationary Expectations). Suppose
that ξt is deterministic and that ξt = 0 for all t ≥ T , for some T > 0. Then, a perfectforesight equilibrium with well-anchored inflationary expectations is a perfect-foresight equilibrium in which πt is deterministic and satisfies limt→∞ πt = π ∗ .
The present model displays strikingly different responses to negative natural rate shocks
depending on their magnitude. The interest-rate feedback rule in place can preserve full
employment in response to small negative natural rate shocks by an appropriate easing of
the nominal interest rate. But if the negative natural rate shock is large, then the Taylor
rule in place is unable to stabilize the economy and involuntary unemployment emerges.
The following proposition gives a lower bound for the set of natural rate shocks that
can be fully neutralized, in the sense that they do not cause unemployment. We refer to
natural rate shocks satisfying this bound as small. The proposition also shows that when
inflationary expectations are well anchored, small negative natural rate shocks generate a
temporary decline in inflation below its target level, π ∗ .
Proposition 7 (Full Employment Under Small Negative Natural Rate Shocks).
Suppose that assumptions 1 and 2 hold, that w−1 = F 0 (h̄), that

and that ξt = 0 for all t ≥ 1. Then, there exists a unique perfect foresight equilibrium with
well-anchored inflationary expectations. Furthermore, the equilibrium features ut = 0 for all
t ≥ 0,

γ(0)
µ

≤ π0 < π ∗ , and πt = π ∗ for all t > 0.

Proof: See Appendix A.
The reason small negative shocks do not cause unemployment is that they can be fully
accommodated by a downward adjustment in the nominal interest rate equal in size to the
decline in the natural rate. Since the nominal interest rate cannot fall below zero, it follows
immediately that one limit to accommodating negative shocks to the natural rate is the zero
bound itself. But the present model delivers an additional limit to the ability of a Taylor
rule to stabilize natural-rate shocks. Specifically, our model implies that inflation cannot fall
17

below γ(0)/µ without causing unemployment. This threshold arises from the presence of
downward nominal wage rigidity and may become binding before nominal interest rates hit
the zero lower bound.If the inflation rate necessary to accommodate the exogenous decline
in the natural rate is below γ(0)/µ, then the real wage will rise above its market clearing
level causing involuntary unemployment.
The maximum natural rate shock that the monetary authority can fully offset by its
interest rate policy depends on the characteristics of the interest rate feedback rule, especially
the inflation coefficient απ and the inflation target π ∗ . If the monetary policy stance is
aggressive, that is, if απ is sufficiently large, then the monetary authority can lower the
nominal interest rate down to zero without requiring current inflation below γ(0)/µ, that is,
without raising real wages in the current period. Under such monetary policy, the maximum
natural rate shock the central bank can offset is one in which the natural rate is equal to the
negative of the inflation target π ∗ . Hence, the larger is the inflation target, the larger is the
range of negative shocks to the natural rate that the central bank can stabilize.
Consider now large negative shocks to the natural rate, that is, values of ξ0 that violate
condition (19). The following proposition shows that if the negative natural rate shock is
large, the Taylor rule fails to preserve full employment.
Proposition 8 (Unemployment Due To Large Negative Natural Rate Shocks).

and that ξt = 0 for all t ≥ 1. Then, in any perfect-foresight equilibrium with well-anchored
inflationary expectations the economy experiences unemployment in period 0, that is, u0 > 0.
Proof: See Appendix A.
To see why a large negative shock to the natural rate causes unemployment, it is of use
to first understand how the optimal monetary policy (i.e., one that ensures full employment
at all times) would react to such a shock. As in the case of small natural rate shocks,
optimal policy calls for lowering the nominal interest rate in tandem with the decline in
the natural rate. In this way, the real rate of interest can fall without igniting a future
inflationary upward spiral. However, by the Taylor rule the easing of current nominal rates
must be accompanied by a fall in the current inflation rate. The latter in turn, if sufficiently
large, drives up real wages in the current period, causing involuntary unemployment. A
second impediment to preserving full employment in response to large negative shocks to
the natural rate is the zero bound on nominal interest rates. This is because the required
18

decline in the nominal interest rate that keeps the real interest rate equal to the natural rate
without causing a rise in expected inflation may imply a negative nominal interest rate. If
this is the case, then unemployment must necessarily emerge.
A central prediction of our model is that when inflationary expectations are well anchored,
the incidence of involuntary unemployment is transitory and that the recovery is accompanied
by job creation. Specifically, after the shock unemployment converges monotonically back to
zero in finite time. In other words, our model predicts that jobless recoveries are impossible
when inflationary expectations are well anchored. The following proposition formalizes this
result.
Proposition 9 (Recoveries With Job Creation). Suppose that assumptions 1 and 2
hold, that w−1 = F 0 (h̄), that condition (20) holds, and that ξt = 0 for all t ≥ 1. Then, in
any perfect-foresight equilibrium with well-anchored inflationary expectations unemployment
converges monotonically to zero in finite time. That is, ut+1 ≤ ut for all t ≥ 0 and ∃T > 0
such that uT +j = 0 for all j ≥ 0.
Proof: See Appendix A.
Furthermore, it is possible to show that the monetary authority lowers the nominal interest rate in the period in which the economy is hit by the large negative natural rate shock, but
∗
immediately thereafter raises it above its target level R∗ (≡ πβ̃ ). Remarkably, the tightening
of policy occurs in an environment in which the economy has not yet fully recovered from
the negative natural rate shock. During this transition involuntary unemployment persists
because the real wage is still above the level consistent with full employment. Because of
downward nominal wage rigidity, the only way to reduce real wages quickly is to engineer
temporarily higher price inflation. To this end, the central bank raises nominal rates to induce, through the Fisher effect an elevation in expected inflation. The following proposition
establishes these results.
Proposition 10 (Inflation and Interest Rate Dynamics). Suppose that assumptions 1
and 2 hold, that w−1 = F 0 (h̄), that condition (20) holds, and that ξt = 0 for all t ≥ 1. Then,
in any perfect-foresight equilibrium with well-anchored inflationary expectations π0 < π ∗ ,
πt > π ∗ for 0 < t < T and πt = π ∗ for all t ≥ T , where T is defined in proposition 9.
Further R0 < R∗ , Rt > R∗ for 0 < t < T , and Rt = R∗ for t ≥ T .
Proof: See Appendix A.
We have fully characterized analytically the dynamics triggered by a purely temporary
decline in the natural rate of interest and have established that the associated contraction
19

features a recovery with job creation. A natural question, however, is whether this result is
robust to allowing for persistence in the negative natural-rate shock. To shed light on this
issue we perform a numerical simulation of the model. We stress that, as in the simulation of
the economy under a confidence shock, here we trace numerically the exact dynamics of the
original nonlinear model. Figure 3 depicts the response of the model economy to a persistent
decline in the natural rate of interest. Specifically, we assume that in period 0 the natural

rate falls from its long-run level of 4 percent per year to -2 percent per year and stays at that
level for 10 quarters. At that point, the natural rate returns permanently to its steady-state
level of 4 percent. We assume that the behavior of the natural rate is deterministic. Formally,
we have that ξt − ξt+1 = ln(0.981/4 β̃) for t = 0, . . . , 9 and ξt − ξt+1 = 0 for t ≥ 10. We pick
the size and duration of the natural-rate shock following Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).2
All structural parameters of the model are as in the calibration presented in section 4.
Like the non-fundamental lack-of-confidence shock studied in the previous section, the

and an absorbent state of 4 percent.

20

persistent (fundamental) natural-rate shock produces an initial contraction in aggregate
activity, involuntary unemployment, deflation, and interest rates up against the zero bound.
However, two main differences between the responses of the economy to the fundamental and
to the non-fundamental shock stand out. First, the recovery from the negative natural-rate
shock features growth in both employment and output. That is, the recovery is characterized
by job creation. By contrast, the recovery from the non-fundamental shock is jobless. Second,
both output and employment begin to recover immediately after period 0. By contrast, the
nonfundamental confidence shock generates a protracted slump.
Taken together, the analysis presented in this and the previous section suggests that the
response of the model economy to a non-fundamental confidence shock provides a better
qualitative account of the the observed behavior of the U.S. economy since the onset of
the great contraction of 2008 than the response of the model economy to a fundamental
natural-rate shock.

Exiting The Slump: An Interest-Rate Peg

In this section, we consider a monetary policy that succeeds in re-anchoring inflationary
expectations when the economy finds itself in a liquidity trap with high unemployment due
to lack of confidence. Specifically, we argue that an interest rate peg that raises the interest
rate from 0 to its intended target level (i.e., an increase in Rt from 1 to R∗ ) can jump-start
the economy and bring it quickly to the intended steady state with full employment.
A natural question is whether an interest-rate peg of this type would not make matters
initially worse by pushing inflation further down and thereby creating more unemployment.
We will show that the answer to this question is no. As we mentioned in the introduction,
in a liquidity trap with lack of confidence, conventional intuitions may not apply. In a
liquidity trap, the nominal interest rate is primarily an anchor of future expected inflation.
By setting the interest rate at zero, as called for by the Taylor rule, the central bank validates
expectations of future deflation. By the same token, raising the gross interest rate from 1 to
R∗ suddenly raises people’s expectations about future inflation. In turn, the expectation of
a higher future rate of inflation erodes expected real wages, thereby facilitating employment
growth.
The interest-rate-based exit strategy we wish to consider is as follows. Let st be a binary
variable that takes the value 1 if the nominal interest rate has fallen to zero in the past.
Formally,
st =

Our assumption of a permanent switch to an interest rate peg is made for simplicity. In
practice, the central bank could switch back to a Taylor rule once the intended steady state
has been reached and inflationary expectations are well anchored again.

The Exit Strategy And Confidence Shocks

As in section 4, we consider a lack of confidence shock that lowers the initial rate of inflation
10 annual basis points below the target rate π ∗ , that is, we assume that π0 = 1.0191/4 .

shock under the exit strategy. To facilitate comparison, the figure reproduces from figure 2
22

with solid lines the response of the economy when monetary policy is always dictated by the
Taylor rule given in equation (10).
A remarkable feature of the equilibrium dynamics under the unconventional exit policy
studied here is that in spite of a significant tightening in monetary policy in period 19 (from
0 to 6 percent per annum) and in spite of the fact that the underlying theoretical framework
is highly Keynesian in nature, the economy initially suffers neither a drop in output nor
an increase in unemployment. On the contrary, the economy starts to recover immediately.
As policy switches to the interest-rate target, output growth jumps above its long-run rate
and unemployment begins a monotonic decline to zero. The economy reaches the intended
steady state (π = π ∗ and u = 0) in finite time. That is, the exit strategy eliminates the
liquidity trap and turns what would have been a jobless recovery into a job-creating one.
A further and general insight of the policy exercise carried out here is that monetary
policy plays a crucial role in determining whether a recovery is jobless or not. Figure 4 can
be interpreted a an example corroborating this insight, for it shows two monetary polices,
one associated with a jobless recovery and with a job-creating one. This is an important
difference between the model of a jobless recovery presented in this paper and alternative
explanations based upon real models with real wage rigidity (see, for instance, Shimer,
2012). By construction, in real models monetary policy plays no role. Existing empirical
evidence suggests that the stance of monetary policy does matter for the occurrence of jobless
recoveries. For example Calvo, Coricelli, and Ottonello (2012) study recession episodes
that follow financial crises. Their sample includes 95 recession episodes in developed and
developing countries. They show that inflation determines whether the recovery is jobless
or not. Low inflation is associated with jobless recoveries whereas high inflation is not.
Our model is consistent with this finding. The top right panel of figure 2 shows that the
jobless recovery occurs in a low-inflation environment, whereas the job-creating recovery
occurs in an environment with relatively higher inflation. Calvo, Coricelli, and Ottonello also
report empirical evidence suggesting that high-inflation crises are characterized by wageless
recoveries, whereas low-inflation crises are characterized by little change in real wages. The
present model is also in line with this finding. Figure 5 displays the response of real wages
and inflation to a lack-of-confidence shock under the Taylor rule (solid lines) and under the
exit strategy (dashed lines). The recovery under the exit strategy features relatively higher
inflation and lower real wage growth than the recovery under the Taylor rule. Under the
Taylor rule, real wages rise throughout the recovery, which causes the recovery to be jobless.
By contrast under the exit strategy real wages decline, thus ushering in employment growth.3
3

The magnitude of the wage increases under the Taylor rule (about 1.5 percent), might seem small.
Recall, however, that our assumed labor share of 75 percent (α = 0.75) implies that the wage elasticity of

We wish to note that the economy can recover from a confidence-shock induced liquidity
trap without any change in monetary policy, i.e., with the Taylor rule in place. This would be
the case if households’ experienced a positive revision in inflationary expectations away from
β̃ and toward the inflation target π ∗ . The peril posed by the Taylor rule, however, is that it
leaves the door always open for expectations of a slump to be self-fulfilling. By contrast, the
central property of the escape strategy considered here is that it forces people’s inflationary
expectations to be π ∗ thereby eliminating the possibility of protracted self-fulfilling liquidity
traps.

6.2

The Exit Strategy And Natural-Rate Shocks

Finally, we consider the performance of the exit strategy studied here when the crisis is not
caused by a nonfundamental lack-of-confidence shock but rather by a fundamental exogenous
persistent fall in the natural rate identical to the one studied in section 5. When the shock
is fundamental, applying the exit strategy has an advantage and a disadvantage relative
to the Taylor rule. The advantage is that the exit strategy, by quickly raising inflationary
expectations, can return the economy to full employment more rapidly. The disadvantage
is that the interest-rate peg leaves the initial rate of inflation, π0 , indeterminate. Since
the initial rate of unemployment is decreasing in the initial rate of inflation, a large initial
deflation could lead to widespread unemployment in period 0. To illustrate the point that
the effect of a negative natural-rate shock need not be worse under the exit strategy than
under the Taylor rule, figure 6 displays the response of the economy under the exit strategy
labor demand is -4 (or 1/(α − 1)), which implies that an increase in the real wage of 1.5 percent above its
market-clearing level causes an increase in the unemployment rate of 6 percent.

inflation and unemployment rates must be identical under both policy regimes. However,
under the exit strategy, the inflation rate overshoots and converges to π ∗ from above. This
brings real wages down contributing to a faster recovery in the labor market. By contrast,
under the Taylor rule, inflation converges to π ∗ from below, implying a slower decline in
real wages, and hence a more prolonged period of unemployment. We conclude that the
interest-rate based strategy to escape liquidity traps presented here may be beneficial even if
the cause of the crisis is fundamental in nature. In addition, the present analysis makes clear
that the conventional wisdom according to which escaping liquidity traps by simply raising
nominal rates must be associated with a worsening of the contraction is not necessarily
correct. A premise behind the conventional wisdom is that inflationary expectations are
relatively irresponsive to changes in the nominal interest rate. As a result, an increase in
the nominal rate is accompanied by an increase in real rates, which causes a contraction
in aggregate demand. This logic, however, does not work during liquidity traps. In these
circumstances the Fisher effect dominates. This means that an increase in the nominal
25

rate of interest causes a rise in inflationary expectations of about the same magnitude. In
turn, when nominal wages are downwardly rigid, the increase in expected inflation lowers
expected real wages and in this way lowers the cost of production for firms thereby fostering
employment.

7

Conclusion

This paper is motivated by the observation that the U.S. great contraction of 2008 was
associated with a jobless recovery, declining inflation expectations, and a liquidity trap. The
main contribution of this paper is to develop a model that captures these facts. The main
elements of the model are downward nominal wage rigidity, a Taylor-type interest-rate rule,
the zero bound on interest rates, and a lack-of-confidence shock.
In the model, a negative confidence shock leads agents to expect a slowdown in future
inflation. Because nominal wages are downwardly rigid, this nonfundamental revision of
expectations makes agents anticipate real wages to rise above the full employment level and
unemployment to emerge. In turn, the expected rise in unemployment depresses current
demand via a negative wealth effect. The weakness in current aggregate demand causes
inflation to fall in the current period. The monetary authority, following the Taylor rule,
reacts to the slowdown in current inflation by lowering interest rates. This policy action
closes the circle, because, by the Fisher effect, the decline in the interest rate signals a fall
in future inflation, validating agents’ initial lack of confidence.
The dynamics triggered by fundamental shocks are quite different and, in particular, do
not capture the empirical fact of a jobless recovery and a protracted liquidity trap. The paper
shows that the behavior of output growth and unemployment inherit the stochastic properties
of the underlying fundamental disturbance. This means that the recovery in output growth
is accompanied by job creation. Put differently, in the proposed model fundamental shocks
fail to generate a jobless recovery. The reason is that if inflationary expectations are well
anchored (i.e., if agents expect the rate of inflation to converge to its intended target), as
soon as the negative shock begins to fade away, inflation picks up driving real wages down
to their full employment level. Another important prediction of the model is that when
aggregate uncertainty is fundamental in nature, the liquidity trap, contrary to what was
observed during the 2008 U.S. great contraction, is short lived. The reason is that when
inflationary expectations are well anchored, inflationary expectations themselves and hence
the nominal interest rate tend to gravitate toward their intended target levels.
Finally, the paper identifies an interest-rate-based strategy for escaping the liquidity trap
and restoring full employment. It consists in pegging the nominal interest rate at its intended
26

target level. The rationale for this strategy is the recognition that in a confidence-shockinduced liquidity trap the effects of an increase in the nominal interest rate are quite different
from what conventional wisdom would dictate. In particular, unlike what happens in normal
times, in an expectations driven liquidity trap the nominal interest rate moves in tandem
with expected inflation. Therefore, in the liquidity trap an increase in the nominal interest
rate is essentially a signal of higher future inflation. In turn, by its effect on real wages,
future inflation stimulates employment, thereby lifting the economy out of the slump.

Appendix A: Proofs of Propositions
Proof of Proposition 1 (Uniqueness of the Full-Employment
Steady State)

Set u = 0. According to (11), we have that the steady-state interest rate is given by
R = π/β̃. Using this expression to eliminate R from equation (18), we obtain that the
steady-state inflation rate, π solves either
π∗

or

By assumption 2, the first expression admits a unique solution π = π ∗ . The second expression
also admits a unique solution given by π = β̃. Note that, by equation (15), the steady-state

this condition but π = β̃ does not. Finally, note that when π = π ∗ by assumption 2
max{1, π ∗ /β̃ + απ (π − π ∗ )} = π ∗ /β̃, which implies that equation (18) is satisfied.

8.2

Proof of Proposition 2 (Uniqueness of the Unemployment

Set ū > 0. From (17) we have that h < h̄. Combining (11) and (18), we have that the rate

the inflation rate at the unemployment steady state. To see this, note that by the slackness
condition (16), condition (15) must hold with equality. That is, π = γ(ū)/µ < γ(0)/µ < π ∗ .
The last inequality follows from assumption 2. Therefore, π cannot exceed π ∗ . This implies
that if an unemployment steady state exists, it must be a liquidity trap, R = π/β̃ = 1.
The unemployment rate in this steady state is determined by condition (15) holding with
28

equality and evaluated at π = β̃. That is, ū is given by the solution to β̃ = γ(ū)/µ. The
fact that ū > 0 follows from the assumptions that β̃ < γ(0)/µ and that γ is decreasing in

Proof of Proposition 3 (Inflation Dynamics Under Lack of
Confidence)

In any period t ≥ 0, the economy can be in one of the following five situations: (1) ut+1 = 0
and Rt = 1; (2) ut+1 = 0 and Rt > 1; (3) ut+1 > 0 and ut+1 ≥ ut ; (4) ut > ut+1 > 0 and
Rt = 1; and (5) ut > ut+1 > 0 and Rt > 1. The proof proceeds by establishing that for
each of these situations, if the conditions of the proposition are satisfied, then πt+1 < π ∗ .
Hence, in period t + 1 the conditions of the proposition are again satisfied. This implies that
πt+j < π ∗ for all j > 0.
Situation (1), ut+1 = 0 and Rt = 1: Because ut+1 = 0, it follows from conditions (6)
and (9) that ht+1 ≥ ht and by the assumed concavity of the utility function we have that
u0 (F (ht+1 ))/u0 (F (ht )) ≤ 1. Using (3) we have that πt+1 must satisfy πt+1 = β̃Rt u0 (F (ht+1 ))/u0 (F (ht )) ≤
< π ∗ , where the penultimate inequality follows from assumption 1 and the last one
β̃ < γ(0)
µ
from assumption 2.
Situation (2), ut+1 = 0 and Rt > 1: Because Rt > 1, by (10), β̃Rt − πt = (απ β̃ −
1)(πt − π ∗ ) − αy ut < 0. By (3), it then follows that πt+1 = β̃Rt u0 (F (ht+1 ))/u0 (F (ht )) <
πt u0 (F (ht+1 ))/u0 (F (ht )) ≤ πt < π ∗ , where the penultimate inequality follows from the fact
that ht+1 ≥ ht and the last inequality follows from the assumption that πt < π ∗ .
Situation (3), ut+1 > 0 and ut+1 ≥ ut : The assumptions of situation (3) imply that
ht+1 ≤ ht and by the concavity of the production function that F 0 (ht )/F 0 (ht+1 ) ≤ 1. Because
0
t)
< γ(0)
< π∗,
ut+1 > 0, condition (7) must hold with equality so that πt+1 = γ(uµt+1 ) FF0 (h(ht+1

where the last inequality is implied by assumption 1.
Situation (4), ut > ut+1 > 0 and Rt = 1: In this situation, ht < ht+1 and hence
F (ht ) < F (ht+1 ). This implies that

u0 (F (ht+1 ))
u0 (F (ht ))

< 1. From equilibrium condition (3) we then

have that πt+1 = β̃Rt uu(F

< π ∗ , where the penultimate inequality follows

from assumption 1 and the last one from assumption 2.
Situation (5), ut > ut+1 > 0 and Rt > 1: As in situation (4), we have that ht < ht+1 and

hence

u0 (F (ht ))

< 1. And as in situation (2), we have Rt > 1 and thus (10) implies that

(ht+1 ))
< β̃Rt < πt < π ∗ .
β̃Rt < πt . Then use (3) to obtain πt+1 = β̃Rt uu(F

It remains to show that there exists a finite T such that πT < γ(0)/µ. Suppose that for
0 h̄)
< γ(uµt+1 ) < γ(0)
.
some t ≥ 0, ut = 0 and ut+1 > 0. Then, (7) implies that πt+1 = γ(uµt+1 ) F F0 (h(t+1
)
µ

This shows the existence of a T such that πT < γ(0)/µ for the case of a switch from full
employment to unemployment. Suppose now that ut = 0 for all t. Then, by (3) Rt = πt+1 /β̃.
Using this expression to eliminate Rt from (10) yields πt+1 = max{β̃, π ∗ + απ β̃(πt − π ∗ )}.
Because πt < π ∗ and because απ β̃ > 1, we have that πt reaches β̃ < γ(0)/µ in finite time.
This shows the existence of a T such that πT < γ(0)/µ. Finally, we must consider the case
that ut > 0 for all t. In this case, we prove the existence of a period T such that πT < γ(0)/µ
by contradiction. Suppose that πt ≥ γ(0)/µ for all t. We have already shown that under the
assumptions of the proposition πt+1 < max{πt , γ(0)/µ}. This means that as long as πt ≥
γ(0)/µ, πt must be monotonically decreasing over time. Since, by assumption πt is bounded
below by γ(0)/µ, we have that πt must converge. Let limt→∞ πt ≡ π ≥ γ(0)/µ. Since, by

assumption, ut > 0 for all t, (7) must hold with equality at all times, that is, πt = γ(uµ t ) FF(h

Because πt ≥ γ(0)/µ > γ(ut )/µ, we have that F 0 (ht−1 ) > F 0 (ht ). This means, by the fact

that ut = (h̄ − ht )/h̄ and by the concavity of F , that ut is decreasing in t. Since ut is
bounded below by 0, we have that ut must converge. Let u ≡ limt→∞ ut . Clearly, 0 ≤ u < 1.
The fact that u < 1 implies that limt→∞ F 0 (ht ) exists and is finite. Taking limits of (7) we

Combining these two expressions, we obtain π = max{β̃, π ∗ + απ β̃(π − π ∗ )}. This expression
has two solutions for π, namely, β̃ and π ∗ . Because β̃ < γ(0)/µ and because we have already

shown that πt < π ∗ for all t, both of these solutions yield a contradiction.

Proof of Proposition 4 (Chronic Involuntary Unemployment

The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that for some t ≥ T , ut = 0. Then, by condition (7)

Proof of Proposition 5 (Existence and Uniqueness of Chronic
Unemployment Equilibria)

Consider the equilibrium conditions (3)-(10). Set ξt = 0 for all t. Use (4) to eliminate
ct from (3) and (5) to eliminate wt from (8) and (7). Then the set of perfect-foresight
equilibrium conditions involves only deterministic sequences for {πt+1 , ht , ut , Rt }∞
t=0 given π0
and h−1 = h̄. The proof is by construction. Suppose first that the initial value for π0
satisfies γ(0)/µ ≤ π0 < π ∗ . First we show that in this case u0 = 0. Suppose the contrary,
0

(h̄)
< γ(uµ0 ) < γ(0)
, where the
that is, u0 > 0. Then by (9) h0 < h̄, and by (7) π0 = γ(uµ0 ) FF0 (h
µ
0)
penultimate inequality follows from the concavity of the function F (.) and from h0 < h̄ and

the last inequality follows from assumption 1. But this is a contradiction. It follows that
u0 = 0 and h0 = h̄. Then R0 is uniquely determined by (10). We have therefore shown that
there are unique values for h0 , u0 , and R0 if γ(0)/µ ≤ π0 < π ∗ . To find π1 proceed as follows:
0

(h1 ))
≥ β̃R0 . Now distinguish two cases: (i) β̃R0 ≥ γ(0)/µ
Note that by (3) π1 = β̃R0 uu0(F
(F (h̄))
and (ii) β̃R0 < γ(0)/µ. In case (i), we have π1 ≥ γ(0)/µ. And as we just have shown

if in any period t we have ht−1 = h̄ and πt ≥ γ(0)/µ, then the period t perfect foresight
solution is unique and features ut = 0. In case (ii)β̃R0 < γ(0)/µ. To rule out u1 = 0, note
that if u1 were 0, then by (3) π1 = β̃R0 < γ(0)/µ. At the same time by (7) π1 ≥ γ(0)/µ.
This results in a contradiction and it follows if a perfect foresight equilibrium exists, it must
feature u1 > 0. Next we show that in this case there exists a unique u1 > 0. Combining (3)
0

0

(h1 ))F (h1 )
. Notice that the left hand side
and (7) holding with equality yields γ(uµ1 ) = β̃R0 uu0 (F
(F (h0 ))F 0 (h0 )
of this expression is monotonically decreasing in u1 and that at u1 = 0 it takes the value
γ(0)/µ. The right hand side is monotonically increasing in u1 and at u1 = 0 it takes the

value β̃R0 < γ(0)/µ. Hence at u1 = 0 the left hand side exceeds the right hand side. Further
as u1 approaches 1, the right hand side approaches infinity, so that as u1 approaches one, the
left hand side is smaller than the right hand side. It follows that there is a single crossing,
and therefore there exists a single value u1 that solves this expression. Given u1 use (9) to
find h1 , (3) to find π1 , use (10) to find R1 . This shows that also in case (ii), there exist
unique values for π1 , R0 , u0 , h0 that satisfy conditions (3)-(10), given γ(0)/µ ≤ π0 < π ∗ and
h−1 = h̄.
To find values for πt+1 , Rt , ut , ht given ht−1 and πt for t ≥ 1, note that if ht−1 = h̄ and if
γ(0)/µ ≤ πt < π ∗ , then we can use the same arguments as those used above to construct the
perfect foresight equilibrium for period t. It follows that for t = 1, because we have already
shown that h0 = h̄ and u0 = 0, we only need to check whether π1 ≥ γ(0)/µ. If so, then we
can proceed with the construction of the equilibrium as above, that is, we obtain u1 = 0,
h1 = h̄, and R1 and π2 in the same fashion as described above.

31

If however, πt < γ(0)/µ, construct the perfect-foresight equilibrium as follows. By proposition 4, in this case ut > 0. Given πt use (7) holding with equality to find a unique value for
ut . To see that this condition has a unique solution write it as: πt F 0 (ht )/F 0 (ht−1 ) = γ(ut )/µ.
The left-hand side is increasing in ut and converges to infinity as ut approaches unity. At
ut = 0 it is less or equal to πt and hence less than γ(0)/µ. The right-hand side is monotonically decreasing. At ut = 0 it is equal to γ(0)/µ. Thus at ut = 0 the left-hand side is smaller
than the right hand side. Consequently, we must have a single crossing implying a unique
value for ut . With ut in hand and πt given, use (10) to find Rt . From proposition (3) we have
that πt+1 < γ(0)/µ and from proposition 4 that ut+1 > 0. Combine (3) and (7) holding with
0
(ht+1 ))F 0 (ht+1 )
. Use this expression to find ut+1 . The left
equality to obtain γ(uµt+1 ) = β̃Rt u (F
u0 (F (ht ))F 0 (ht )
hand side of this expression is decreasing and at ut+1 = 0 equal to γ(0)/µ. The right hand
side is monotonically increasing in ut+1 . At ut+1 = ut > 0 it is equal to β̃Rt . Notice that
β̃Rt ≤ max{β̃, πt } < γ(0)/µ. Therefore, at ut+1 = 0, the right-hand side must be less than
the left-hand side. As ut+1 approaches unity the right-hand side becomes infinity. Therefore,
there exists a single crossing. This shows that ut+1 is unique. With ut+1 in hand use (3) to
find πt+1 . We have therefore shown how to construct values for ut , ht , Rt , πt+1 in the case
that πt < γ(0)/µ for an arbitrary ht−1 and that the so constructed values are unique. We
can proceed in this fashion to obtain {ht , ut , Rt , πt+1 }∞
t=0 .

8.6

Proof of Proposition 6 (Convergence To A Liquidity Trap
With Unemployment)

By proposition 3, inflation is always strictly below its target level π ∗ . This means that
the economy cannot converge to the full-employment steady state (π, R, u) = (π ∗ , R∗ , 0).
Since the only remaining steady state is the unemployment steady state. the claim of the
proposition must hold.

8.7

Proof of Proposition 7 (Full Employment Under Small Negative Taste Shocks)

First, we show that if condition (19) is satisfied, then an equilibrium with ut = 0 for all
t ≥ 0, π0 < π ∗ , and πt = π ∗ for t > 0 exists. The proof proceeds by showing that the
proposed equilibrium path satisfies the complete set of equilibrium conditions, given by
expressions (3)-(10) for all t ≥ 0. Setting ht = h̄ for all t ≥ 0 ensures that (6), (8), and (9)
hold for all t. Then setting ct = F (h̄) for all t ≥ 0 and wt = F 0 (h̄) ensures the satisfaction of
∗

(4) and (5) for all t ≥ 0. Setting R0 = eξ0 πβ̃ and Rt =
32

π∗
β̃

for all t > 0 implies that (3) holds

for all t ≥ 0. Condition (19) guarantees that R0 ≥ 1. To ensure that (10) holds in period
0, set π0 at a value satisfying eξ0 π ∗ /β̃ ≥ π ∗ /β̃ + απ (π0 − π ∗ ). That is, pick π0 such that
π∗
. Clearly, π0 < π ∗ . At the same time, for (7) to be satisfied at t = 0,
π0 ≤ π ∗ + (eξ0 − 1) β̃α
π

π0 must take values in the range π0 ≥ γ(0)/µ. Combining the above two inequalities we
π∗
≥ π0 ≥ γ(0)/µ. Condition (19) guarantees that this interval is
obtain that π ∗ + (eξ0 − 1) β̃α
π

nonempty. Finally, assumption 2 guarantees that the proposed equilibrium satisfies (7) and
(10) for all t > 0. This completes the proof of existence of an equilibrium with well-anchored
inflationary expectations.
The proof of uniqueness proceeds by first establishing that any equilibrium with wellanchored expectations must feature πt ≥ π ∗ for any t > 0. This result is a direct implication
of Proposition 3, which shows that if for any t > 0, πt < π ∗ , then πt+j < π ∗ for all j > 0.
By definition, an equilibrium with such a path for inflation is not one with well-anchored
inflationary expectations. The next step is to show that under the conditions given in the
proposition u0 = 0. This result is implied by lemma 1 in Appendix B. It also follows
that h0 = h̄ and that w0 = F 0 (h̄). Then lemmas 2 and 3 in Appendix B show that in
any equilibrium with well-anchored inflationary expectations ut = 0 for all t > 0 and that
πt = π ∗ for all t > 0, respectively. It remains to be shown that π0 is unique. Evaluating (3)
at t = 0 yields a unique value of R0 , given by R0 = eξ0 π ∗ /β̃. Since the event eξ0 π ∗ /β̃ = 1 is of
measure zero, we have, by condition (19), that R0 > 1 in general. Then use this expression
to eliminate R0 from (10) to obtain eξ0 π ∗ /β̃ = π ∗ /β̃ +απ (π0 −π ∗ ), which uniquely determines
π 0 .4

8.8

Proof of Proposition 8 (Unemployment Due To Large Negative Taste Shocks)

The proposition follows directly from lemmas 3 and 4 in Appendix B. Lemma 4 establishes
that if u0 = 0, then π1 must be greater than π ∗ . Lemma 3 establishes that no equilibrium
with well-anchored inflationary expectations exists if u0 = 0 and π1 > π ∗ .

Proof of Proposition 10 (Inflation and Interest Rate Dynamics)

It follows directly from proposition 3 that πt ≥ π ∗ for t > 0 in any equilibrium with wellanchored inflationary expectations and under the assumptions of the proposition. To see
that π0 < π ∗ notice that because, by proposition 8, u0 > 0, condition (7) must hold with
0 (h̄)
< γ(uµ0 ) < γ(0)
< π ∗ . The first inequality
equality in period 0, that is, π0 = γ(uµ0 ) FF0 (h
µ
0)
follows from the fact that h0 < h̄ and the concavity of F , the second inequality follows
from assumption 1, and the third follows from assumption 2. Because u0 > 0 and π0 < π ∗ ,
equation (10) implies that R0 < π ∗ /β̃ ≡ R∗ . The result that πt ≥ π ∗ for t > 0 together with
Lemma 4 in Appendix B implies that πt = π ∗ for all t > T . To see that πT = π ∗ , note that,
by condition (3) and the facts that uT = uT +1 = 0 and that πT +1 = π ∗ , RT = π ∗ /β̃ > 1.
Using this expression to eliminate RT from (10) and taking into account that uT = 0, yields
πT = π ∗ . It remains to establish that πt > π ∗ for 0 < t < T . By (3), we have that for
∗
u0 (F (ht )

0 < t < T Rt = πt+1

that ht+1 > ht established in proposition 9. The second inequality follows from the result
that πt ≥ π ∗ . Using this expression to eliminate Rt from (10) and taking into account that
ut is positive for 0 < t < T , we obtain πt > π ∗ for 0 < t < T .

for all t with probability 1. Then, any equilibrium in which πt > π ∗ features limj→∞ πt+j = ∞.
Proof: Suppose πt > π ∗ . Given the conditions stated in the current lemma it follows from
Lemma 2 that ut = 0. Condition (10) then yields that Rt =

Because u(.) and F (.) are concave and because,
by (6), ht+1 ≤ h̄, we have that πt+1 ≥ β̃Rt . Use the above expression to eliminate Rt . This
yields: (πt+1 − π ∗ ) ≥ β̃απ (πt − π ∗ ). Because, by assumption 2, β̃απ > 1, we have that
πt+1 > πt . Since wt = F 0 (h̄) and πt+1 > π ∗ , the conditions of the lemma are also satisfied
for period t + 1, which means that by the above arguments πt+2 − π ∗ ≥ β̃απ (πt+1 − π ∗ ).
Continuing with this argument yields that limj→∞ πt+j = ∞.
Lemma 4. If the taste shock is such that condition (19) is not satisfied and assumptions 1
and 2 hold and w−1 = F 0 (h̄), any equilibrium featuring u0 = 0 must also feature π1 > π ∗ .
Proof: The proof is in two steps, one corresponding to the case in which condition (19)
is violated because its left hand side is less than the first argument on the right hand side,

and the other corresponding to the case in which the left hand side is less than the second
argument on the right-hand side.
