The Macroeconomic Effects of Interest on Reserves

JEL No. E31,E32,E51,E52,E58
ABSTRACT
This paper uses a New Keynesian model with banks and deposits to study the macroeconomic effects
of policies that pay interest on reserves. While their effects on output and inflation are small, these
policies require major adjustments in the way that the monetary authority manages the supply of reserves,
as liquidity effects vanish in the short run. In the long run, however, the additional degree of freedom
the monetary authority acquires by paying interest on reserves is best described as affecting the real
quantity of reserves: policy actions that change prices must still change the nominal quantity of reserves
proportionally.

Introduction

Slowly but surely over the three decades that have passed since the Federal Reserve’s monetarist experiment of 1979 through 1982, the role of the monetary aggregates in both the
making and analysis of monetary policy has eroded. Bernanke’s (2006) historical account explains how and why Federal Reserve officials gradually deemphasized measures of the money
supply as targets and indicators for monetary policy over these years. Taylor’s (1993) highly
influential work shows that, instead, Federal Reserve policy beginning in the mid-1980s is described quite well by a strikingly parsimonious rule for adjusting the short-term interest rate
in response to movements in output and inflation. Taylor’s insight has since been embedded
fully into theoretical analyses of monetary policy and its effects on the macroeconomy, which
now depict central bank policy as a rule for managing the short-term interest rate. Indeed,
textbook New Keynesian models such as Woodford’s (2003) and Gali’s (2008) typically make
no reference at all to any measure of the money supply, yet succeed nonetheless in providing
a complete and coherent description of the dynamics of output, inflation, and interest rates.
Still, as discussed by Ireland (2008) with reference to both practice and theory, the
central bank’s ability to manage short-term interest rates has rested, ultimately, on its
ability to control, mainly through open market purchases and sales of government bonds,
the quantity of reserves supplied to the banking system. Recently, however, Goodfriend
(2002), Ennis and Weinberg (2007), and Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008) have all
suggested that, to some extent, even this last remaining role for a measure of money in the
monetary policymaking process can weaken when the central bank pays interest on reserves.
In the United States, interest on reserves moved quickly from being a theoretical possibility
to becoming an aspect of reality when, first, the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of
2006 promised to grant the Federal Reserve the power to pay interest on reserves starting
on October 1, 2011, second, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 brought
that starting date forward to October 1, 2008, and third, the Federal Reserve announced on
October 6, 2008 that it would, in fact, begin paying interest on reserves.
1

Figure 1 begins to suggest how the mechanics of the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate
targeting procedures can change with the introduction of interest payments on reserves. In
both panels, the quantity of reserves gets measured along the horizontal axis and the federal
funds rate along the vertical axis. The demand curve for reserves slopes downward, since
as the federal funds rate falls, those banks that typically borrow reserves find that the cost
of doing so has declined and those banks that typically lend reserves find that the benefit
of doing so has declined: all banks, therefore, wish to hold more reserves. The notation
in panel (a), DR(F F R; RR = 0), makes clear that while the demand curve describes a
relationship between banks’ desired holdings of reserves and the federal funds rate F F R,
this relationship also depends on the fact that, by assumption, the interest rate RR paid on
reserves equals zero. In other words, a change in the federal funds rate leads to a movement
along the downward-sloping demand curve, whereas a change in the interest rate paid on
reserves shifts the demand curve. Panel (a) thereby shows that with RR = 0, the Federal
Reserve hits its target F F R0 for the federal funds rate by conducting open market operations
that leave QR0 dollars of reserves to circulate among banks in the system.
Panel (b) then shows how the payment of interest on reserves places a floor under the
federal funds rate. For if the federal funds rate does fall below the rate RR0 > 0 at which the
Fed pays interest on reserves, any individual bank can earn profits by borrowing reserves from
another bank and depositing them at the Fed; this excess demand for reserves then pushes
the funds rate back to RR0 . In fact, the demand curve in panel (b) becomes horizontal when
the federal funds rate reaches RR0 , assuming that then, banks become indifferent between
lending reserves out and holding them on deposit at the Fed. Of course, these observations
simply generalize those that could have been made when describing panel (a) for the case
without interest on reserves: there, the lower bound for the federal funds rate equals zero,
since no bank will lend reserves at a negative rate when those funds can be held without
opportunity cost either as vault cash or as deposits at the Fed. However, the Federal Reserve
Board (2008) cites this as one of the major rationales for its new interest-on-reserves policy:

2

that it can be used to set a positive lower bound for the federal funds rate.
When, in panel (b), the Federal Reserve’s funds rate target F F R0 remains above the
interest rate RR0 paid on reserves, the Fed must still conduct open market operations to
make the quantity of reserves supplied, QR1 , equal to the quantity demanded. But with
interest on reserves, the opportunity cost of holding funds on deposit at the Fed is measured
by the spread F F R0 − RR0 ; since this spread is, of course, smaller in magnitude than the
federal funds rate itself, the demand curve for reserves shifts to the right moving from panel
(a) to panel (b). Thus, with interest on reserves, the level of reserves QR1 required to
support the funds rate target F F R0 in panel (b) is generally larger than the level of reserves
QR0 required to support the same funds rate target shown in panel (a) for the case without
interest on reserves. This is one of the points emphasized by Goodfriend (2002), Ennis and
Weinberg (2007), and Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008): the ability to pay interest
on reserves gives the Federal Reserve an additional tool of monetary policy that provides
another degree of freedom in the policymaking process since, by adjusting the interest rate
paid on reserves, the Fed can achieve different combinations of settings for both the federal
funds rate and the quantity of reserves.
But panel (b) of figure 1 also highlights something more. Suppose that the Federal
Reserve sets a funds rate target F F R1 equal to the interest rate RR0 it pays on reserves.
Then a new equilibrium is reached in which the quantity of reserves supplied QR2 can lie
anywhere along the horizontal segment of the demand curve. In this case, to use Keister,
Martin, and McAndrews’ (2008) apt words, paying interest on reserves appears to “divorce
money from monetary policy,” since there is an entire continuum of values that can be chosen
for the quantity of reserves, all of which remain consistent with the Federal Reserve’s federal
funds rate target.
Though highly suggestive, the two panels of figure 1 provide only a partial view of
the changes that take place once a central bank begins paying interest on reserves. Most
importantly, both panels hold the price level fixed, and while the Keynesian assumption of a

3

fixed aggregate price level may be perfectly justified when looking at the effects of monetary
policy over short horizons, measured in days or weeks, the question remains as to what will
happen over longer intervals, as weeks blend into months and then quarter years and prices
begin to change. Likewise, the graphs ignore the effects that changes in output, including
those brought about in the short run by monetary policy actions themselves, may have
on the demand for reserves. And to the extent that changes in the interest rate paid on
reserves get passed along to consumers through changes in retail deposit rates, and to the
extent that those changes in deposit rates then set off portfolio rebalancing by households,
additional effects that feed back into banks’ demand for reserves get ignored as well. One
cannot tell from these graphs whether changes in the federal funds rate, holding the interest
rate on reserves fixed either at zero or some positive rate, have different effects on output
and inflation than changes in the federal funds rate that occur when the interest rate on
reserves is moved in lockstep to maintain a constant spread between the two; if that spread
between the federal funds rate and the interest rate on reserves acts as a tax on banking
activity, those differences may be important too. All of these considerations underscore that
assessing the full, dynamic effects of monetary policies that involve the payment of interest
on reserves requires a fully dynamic and stochastic general equilibrium model. The purpose
of this paper is to build and analyze such a model, so as to explore the macroeconomic effects
of interest on reserves in more detail.
First and foremost, the dynamic model developed here provides a sharper view of the
additional possibilities opened up by the extra degree of freedom a central bank obtains
when it has the ability to pay interest on reserves. For a given setting of the short-term
nominal interest rate – the model’s analog to the federal funds rate – adjustments to the
interest rate paid on reserves are best described as changing the real quantity of reserves
demanded by banks. Thus, while the extra degree of freedom does allow the central bank to
target simultaneously the short-term nominal interest rate and the real quantity of reserves,
the model shows that monetary policy actions intended to bring about long-run changes in

4

the aggregate price level must still be accompanied by proportional changes in the nominal
supply of reserves. Quite strikingly, however, the model also reveals that households’ shifts in
and out of bank deposits change considerably when the central bank begins paying interest
on reserves. As a consequence, the precise sequence of changes in the supply of reserves
required to support a given series of movements in the short-term interest rate can also
change considerably – not just in timing and magnitude but even in direction – depending
on the central bank’s policy for paying interest on reserves. When calibrated to match key
features of the United States economy, the model implies that policies of paying interest
on reserves have only small effects on output and inflation. On the other hand, the model
suggests that these effects can be larger in other economies, where the banking system is
less efficient and monetary policy is a larger source of instability. The paper’s conclusion
discusses the implications of these results for the Federal Reserve, as it begins to unwind the
unprecedentedly large monetary policy actions taken during the financial crisis of 2008 and
the severe recession that followed.
The basic features of the model used here can be described in relation to those that
appear in previous work that explores the effects of policies that pay interest on reserves.
Sargent and Wallace (1985) and Smith (1991) use overlapping generations models of money
to see whether the payment of interest on reserves gives rise to problems of equilibrium
indeterminacy; Hornstein (2010) does the same, using a model in which monetary assets
appear in an infinitely-lived representative agent’s utility function, output is exogenous,
and the price level is perfectly flexible. Here, these issues of equilibrium determinacy are
revisited, but with the help of a model with infinitely-lived agents, endogenous output, and
sticky goods prices that resembles more closely the textbook New Keynesian frameworks of
Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008).
Berentsen and Monnet (2008) also use a dynamic, general equilibrium model to investigate the workings of monetary policy systems that pay interest on reserves. In particular,
Berentsen and Monnet employ a search-theoretic framework that highlights, in great detail,

5

how schemes involving the paying of interest on reserves can help systems of payment operate more efficiently and thereby improve resource allocations supported by decentralized
markets in which money serves as a medium of exchange. Here, as in Belongia and Ireland
(2012) but in contrast to most other New Keynesian models, the medium of exchange role
played by currency and bank deposits receives some attention. But, by generating a demand
for money through a more stylized shopping-time specification as opposed to an explicit
description of decentralized trade, the model used here can go beyond Berentsen and Monnet’s in other ways, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the dynamics of macroeconomic
variables including output, inflation, and interest rates that compares to similar analyses
conducted with more conventional New Keynesian models.
Finally and most recently, Kashyap and Stein (2012) develop a detailed model of the
financial sector, in which the spread between the between the federal funds rate and the
interest rate paid on reserves acts as a time-varying tax, and show how a central bank might
use this time-varying tax to stabilize a fractional reserves banking system. Here, the spread
between the federal funds rate and the interest rate paid on reserves also appears as a tax on
banks. Once again, however, the description of the banking system provided here remains
more stylized so that, while some attention is paid below to shocks that disrupt the financial
sector, issues relaing to the optimal design, structure, and regulation of the financial system
cannot receive the extensive consideration they get in Kashyap and Stein (2012) and the
three other studies mentioned previously: Goodfriend (2002), Ennis and Weinberg (2007),
and Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008). Here, however, banks’ activities get modeled
together with those of households and all other firms in the economy, so that the broader
focus can be on the macroeconomic effects of interest on reserves.

The Model

2.1

Overview

Belongia and Ireland (2012) extend the standard New Keynesian framework, exposited by
Woodford (2003) and Gali (2008) and used by many others, to incorporate roles for currency
and bank deposits in providing monetary services to households. There, the objective is
to revisit issues first raised by Barnett (1980) concerning the ability of simple-sum versus
Divisia monetary aggregates to track movements in the true quantity of monetary services
provided by liquid assets supplied by both the government and the private banking system.
Here, the same model gets extended still further to consider the macroeconomic effects of
monetary policies that manage both a short-term market rate of interest, like the federal
funds rate in the United States, and the rate of interest on reserves. This extended model
allows the host of issues, raised above with the help of figure 1, to be addressed head on,
directly and fully, with a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model, but requires a more
elaborate description of how banks optimally manage their holdings of reserves. In particular,
the previous model in Belongia and Ireland (2012) simply posits an exogenously-varying
reserve ratio that affects other aspects of bank behavior but is not itself an explicit choice
variable as it is here. The extended model developed here also introduces the additional cost
channel for monetary policy proposed and analyzed by Barth and Ramey (2001), Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), Ravenna and Walsh (2006), Rabanal (2007), and Surico
(2008), both to provide a potentially important role for bank loans as well as deposits and
to insure that the full effects of monetary policy on the dynamics of output and inflation are
accounted for.
The model economy consists of a representative consumer, a representative finished
goods-producing firm, a continuum of intermediate goods-producing firms indexed by i ∈
[0, 1], a representative bank, and a monetary authority. During each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
each intermediate goods-producing firm produces a distinct, perishable intermediate good.

7

Hence, intermediate goods may also be indexed by i ∈ [0, 1], where firm i produces good
i. The model features enough symmetry, however, to allow the analysis to focus on the
behavior of a representative intermediate goods-producing firm that produces the generic
intermediate good i. The activities of each of these agents will now be described in turn.

2.2

The Representative Household

The representative household enters each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . . with Mt−1 units of currency,
Bt−1 bonds, and st−1 (i) shares in each intermediate goods-producing firm i ∈ [0, 1]. At the
beginning of each period, the household receives Tt additional units of currency in the form
of a lump-sum transfer from the monetary authority. Next, the household’s bonds mature,
providing Bt−1 more units of currency. The household uses some of this currency to purchase
Bt new bonds at the price of 1/rt dollars per bond, where rt denotes the gross nominal interest
rate between t and t + 1, and st (i) new shares in each intermediate goods-producing firm
i ∈ [0, 1] at the price of Qt (i) dollars per share.
After this initial securities-trading session, the household is left with

units of currency. It keeps Nt units of this currency to purchase goods and deposits the rest
in the representative bank. At the same time, the household also borrows Lht dollars from
the bank, bringing the total nominal value of its deposits to

The household also supplies hbt units of labor to the representative bank. The household
therefore receives Wt ht in labor income, where Wt denotes the nominal wage rate and
ht = hgt + hbt

denotes total hours worked in goods production and banking.
Also during period t, the household purchases Ct units of the finished good at the nominal
price Pt from the representative finished goods-producing firm. Making this transaction
requires

Mta = [(v n )1/ω Nt

+ (1 − v n )1/ω (Dth )(ω−1)/ω ]ω/(ω−1) .

(4)

In the shopping-time specification (3), the parameter χ > 1 governs the rate at which the
effort required to purchase goods and services increases as the household economizes on its
holdings of monetary assets. The shock vta impacts on the household’s total demand for
monetary services; it follows the autoregressive process

a
) + εavt .
ln(vta ) = (1 − ρav ) ln(v a ) + ρav ln(vt−1

(5)

where v a > 0 helps determine the steady-state level of real monetary services demanded
relative to consumption, the persistence parameter satisfies 0 ≤ ρav < 1, and the serially
uncorrelated innovation εavt has mean zero and standard deviation σva . In the monetary
aggregation specification (4), the parameter ω > 0 measures the elasticity of substitution
between currency and deposits in creating liquidity services and the parameter v n , satisfying
0 < v n < 1, helps determine the steady-state share of currency versus deposits in creating the
9

monetary aggregate. Although (3)-(5) describe the liquidity services provided by currency
and bank deposits in a highly stylized manner relative to more elaborate models of decentralized trade such as Berentsen and Monnet’s (2008), they nevertheless allow for a considerably
richer depiction of shifts in the household’s portfolio of liquid assets that may arise when the
monetary authority changes its policy of paying interest on reserves than those that appear
in simpler cash-in-advance or money-in-the-utility function models. As shown below, these
portfolio shifts have important implications for how the monetary authority must manage
the supply of reserves when it adjusts its target for the short-term market rate of interest
rt while also paying interest on reserves. Jones, Asaftei, and Wang (2004) and Cysne and
Turchick (2012) use similar models, but without interest on reserves, to estimate the welfare
cost of inflation in economies where consumers also have opportunities to substitute between
currency and deposits as alternative media of exchange.
At the end of period t, the household owes the bank rtl Lht dollars, where rtl is the gross,
competitively-determined interest rate on loans. At the same time, however, the bank owes
the household rtd Dth dollars, where rtd is the gross, competitively-determined interest rate on
deposits. The household also receives a nominal dividend payment Ft (i) for each share it
owns in each intermediate goods-producing firm i ∈ [0, 1]. After all these payments get sent
and received, the household carries Mt units of currency into period t + 1, where
Z
Mt = Nt + Wt ht +

The household, therefore, chooses sequences for Bt , st (i) for all i ∈ [0, 1], Nt , Dth , Lht , ht ,
Ct , hst , Mta , and Mt for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . . to maximize the expected utility function

where the discount factor satisfies 0 < β < 1 and η > 0 measures the weight on leisure versus

ln(at ) = ρa ln(at−1 ) + εat ,

(8)

where the persistence parameter satisfies 0 ≤ ρa < 1 and the serially uncorrelated innovation
εat has mean zero and standard deviation σa . The household makes its optimal choices
subject to the constraints (1), (3), (4), and (6), each of which must hold for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
taking as given the behavior of the exogenous shocks described by (5) and (8) for all t =
0, 1, 2, . . ..
A convenient way to characterize the solution to the household’s problem is to substitute
the shopping-time specification (3) into the utility function (7) and to express the remaining
constraints (1), (4), and (6) in real terms by dividing through by the nominal price level Pt

The Representative Finished Goods-Producing Firm

During each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the representative finished goods-producing firm uses Yt (i)
units of each intermediate good i ∈ [0, 1], purchased at the nominal price Pt (i), to manufacture Yt units of the finished good according to the constant-returns-to-scale technology

2.4

The Representative Intermediate Goods-Producing Firm

During each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the representative intermediate goods-producing firm
hires hgt (i) units of labor from the representative household to manufacture Yt (i) units of
intermediate good i according to the constant-returns-to-scale technology described by

Zt hgt (i) ≥ Yt (i).

(22)

The aggregate technology shock follows a random walk with positive drift:

ln(Zt ) = ln(z) + ln(Zt−1 ) + εzt ,

(23)

where z > 1 and the serially uncorrelated innovation εzt has mean zero and standard deviation σz .
13

To provide an additional role for bank lending and to introduce a cost channel of the kind
described by Barth and Ramey (2001) into the model, it is assumed that the representative
intermediate goods-producing firm must pay a fraction φd , with 0 ≤ φd ≤ 1, of its total wage
bill Wt hgt using bank deposits Dtf (i); the firm then pays the remaining fraction 1 − φd of its
wage bill out of revenues earned during the period. More specifically, the firm is assumed to
borrow the amount Lft (i) from the representative bank at the beginning of the period; since
loans to households and firms have identical liquidity and risk characteristics, competitive
banks will charge firms the same interest rate rtl on these loans to firms as they do on loans
to households. The representative firm places the full amount of its loan on deposit, so that

Dtf (i) = Lft (i),

(24)

thereby simultaneously earning interest on the funds at the deposit rate rtd . Then, during
each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the firm faces the deposits-in-advance constraint,

Dtf (i) ≥ φd Wt hgt (i)

(25)

and this constraint will bind so long as the interest rate on loans rtl exceeds the interest rate
on deposits rtd . In a manner similar to Rabanal (2007) and Surico (2008), the importance
of the cost channel can be varied here by adjusting the numerical value assigned to the
parameter φd , with φd = 0 corresponding to the case where this additional channel is absent
and φd = 1 to the case considered by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) and Ravenna
and Walsh (2006) where the cost channel reaches its maximum strength.
Since intermediate goods substitute imperfectly for one another in producing the finished
good, the representative intermediate goods-producing firm sells its output in a monopolistically competitive market. Hence, during each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the intermediate goodsproducing firm sets the nominal price Pt (i) for its output, subject to the requirement that it
satisfy the representative finished goods-producing firm’s demand, described by (21). In ad14

dition, following Rotemberg (1982), the intermediate goods-producing firm faces a quadratic
cost of adjusting its nominal price, measured in units of the finished good and given by

2
Pt (i)
φp
− 1 Yt ,
2 πPt−1 (i)
where the parameter φp > 0 governs the magnitude of the price adjustment cost and where
π > 1 denotes the gross, steady-state inflation rate.
The cost of price adjustment makes the intermediate goods-producing firm’s problem

During each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the representative bank issues deposits worth a total of

(29)

In (29), the parameter ν > 0 measures the elasticity of substitution between reserves and
labor in the deposit creation process and the parameter xn , satisfying 0 < xn < 1, helps
determine the share of reserves relative to labor in producing deposits. The shock xat to
productivity in the banking sector follows the autoregressive process

ln(xat ) = (1 − ρax ) ln(xa ) + ρax ln(xat−1 ) + εaxt ,

(30)

where xa > 0, 0 ≤ ρax < 1, and the serially correlated innovation εaxt has mean zero and
standard deviation σxa .
Similar in spirit to the shopping-time specification in (3)-(5), the banking technology
described by (29) and (30) is intended to account – once again in a stylized way – not
only for the costs of maintaining bank branches and automated teller machines for the
convenience of deposit holders, but also for the costs of managing assets and liabilities
with different characteristics within the bank. Thus, for instance, while there is no literal
16

maturity mismatch between bank loans and bank deposits in the model, the specification in
(29) reflects the idea that the representative bank can cope more easily with deposit inflows
and outflows when it holds a larger stock of reserves.
In fact, (29) by itself implies that the representative bank can always reduce its labor
input at the margin by holding additional reserves. In particular, the bank’s demand for
reserves grows without bound, rather than approaching a finite satiation point as shown in
figure 1, as the opportunity cost of holding reserves shrinks towards zero. Without further
modification, therefore, a well-defined equilibrium for this model will fail to exist when the
monetary authority pays interest on reserves at the market rate rt offered by bonds. Suppose,
however, that in order to manage its stock of reserves worth Ntv /Pt in real terms, the bank
must hire hvt additional units of labor, where
Zt hvt


≥ φv

Ntv
Pt


.

(31)

When the parameter φv > 0 is very small but strictly positive, the additional labor required
by (31) has little effect on aggregate resource allocations, but ensures that banks’ holdings
of reserves remain finite and uniquely-determined even when the monetary authority pays
interest on those reserves at the market rate. With the addition of this feature, the total
amount of labor employed by the bank is given by

hbt = hdt + hvt ,

(32)

and the assumption, reflected in both (29) and (31), that labor productivity across all banking activities grows at the same stochastic rate as it does in the production of intermediate
goods described by (22) and (23), ensures that the model remains consistent with balanced
growth.
After deciding on its optimal holdings of reserves Ntv , the bank lends out its remaining

17

describe the breakdown of total loans Lt into those channeled to households, Lht , and those
channeled to all of the intermediate goods-producing firms, Lft . As noted above, all deposits
pay interest at the gross rate rtd and all loans earn interest at the gross rate rtl . Hence,
during each period t, the bank chooses Dt , Ntv , Lt , hdt , and hvt to maximize its profits, given
in nominal terms by

(rtl − 1)Lt + (rtv − 1)Ntv − (rtd − 1)Dt − Wt (hdt + hvt ),

(35)

subject to the constraints (29), (31), and (33) and taking as given the behavior of the
exogenous shocks described by (23) and (30) for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
A convenient way to characterize the solution to the bank’s problem is to substitute the
constraints (29), (31), and (33) into the expression (35) for profits, which can be rewritten
in real terms as

Equation (36) serves to highlight that the bank earns revenue from charging a higher interest
rate on its loans than it must pay on its deposits, but also incurs both an opportunity and
18

a real resource cost of holding reserves and must compensate its workers for their efforts in
creating deposits. Note that (12), (16), and (20) imply that rt = rtl for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . .:
since households can obtain funds either by selling bonds or borrowing from banks, the
interest rate on bonds must equal the interest rate on loans. In light of this no-arbitrage
condition, the first-order conditions for the bank’s problem can be written as

and (29), (31), and (33) with equality for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
Equation (37) confirms that in the absence of the additional labor requirement imposed
through (31), the representative bank’s demand for reserves grows without bound as the
spread rt − rtv between the market rate and the interest rate on reserves shrinks to zero.
Equation (37) also helps foreshadow many of the quantitative results that follow. Suppose,
in particular, that the monetary authority uses a Taylor (1993) rule to manage the short-term
interest rate rt . Equation (37) then shows how, as anticipated in figure 1 and by Goodfriend
(2002), Ennis and Weinberg (2007), and Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008), the ability
to pay interest on reserves at the positive rate rtv gives the monetary authority an extra
degree of freedom that it can use to target the supply of reserves to the banking system
independently from the short-term market rate. Equation (37) suggests, however, that in
this dynamic model, the additional degree of freedom is best described as one that determines
the real quantity of reserves Ntv /Pt as opposed to the nominal quantity of reserves Ntv , so
that a set of monetary policy actions intended to increase or decrease the aggregate price
level Pt will still have to involve a proportional change in the nominal supply of reserves.

which shows how the cost of deposit creation, which in turn depends on the opportunity
cost of holding reserves and the cost of labor, drives a spread between the competitivelydetermined interest rate on bonds and loans and the competitively-determined interest rate
on deposits.

2.6

The Monetary Authority

As usual in New Keynesian models like this one, the monetary authority will be assumed to
conduct monetary policy by adjusting the short-term market rate of interest rt in response
to movements in inflation πt = Pt /Pt−1 and a stationary measure of real economic activity,
in this case the rate of output growth

gt = Yt /Yt−1 ,

(40)

since the level of output inherits a random walk from the nonstationary technology shock
(23), The modified Taylor (1993) rule

ln(rt /r) = ρr ln(rt−1 /r) + ρπ ln(πt−1 /π) + ρg ln(gt−1 /g) + εrt

(41)

allows, in addition, for interest rate smoothing through the lagged interest rate term on the
right-hand side. In (41), the constants r, π, and g denote the steady-state values of the
short-term nominal interest rate, the inflation rate, and the output growth rate, the Taylor
rule coefficients ρr ≥ 0, ρπ ≥ 0, and ρg ≥ 0 are chosen by the monetary authority, and the
serially uncorrelated innovation εrt has mean zero and standard deviation σr .
In addition, here, the monetary authority must choose a rule for determining the interest
20

rate rtv it pays on reserves. By specifying a general rule of the form rtv = τt rtα or, in logs,
ln(rtv ) = ln(τt ) + α ln(rt ),

(42)

where α ≥ 0 is a parameter, the new variable τt follows the autoregressive process

ln(τt ) = (1 − ρτ ) ln(τ ) + ρτ ln(τt−1 ) + ετ t

(43)

with τ ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ ρτ < 1, and the serially uncorrelated innovation ετ t has mean zero
and standard deviation στ , the general model allows flexibly for a number of special cases,
including: (i) the standard case with α = 0, τ = 1, ρτ = 0, and στ = 0, in which no interest is
paid on reserves, (ii) the case with α = 0, τ > 1, ρτ = 0, and στ = 0, in which interest is paid
on reserves at the constant, gross rate τ , (iii) the case with α = 1, 0 < τ < 1, ρτ = 0, and
στ = 0, in which the monetary authority maintains a constant, 100(1 − τ ) percentage-point
spread between the market rate and the interest rate on reserves, (iv) the case with α = 1,
τ = 1, ρτ = 0, and στ = 0, in which interest is paid on reserves at the market rate, and (v)
a variety of cases with 0 ≤ ρτ < 1 and στ > 0, in which there is independent, stochastic
variation in the rate of interest on reserves, giving rise to a time-varying spread between the
market rate and the rate of interest on reserves.

2.7

The Demand for Monetary Assets and Services

In this model with currency and deposits, the variable Mta represents the true aggregate
of monetary services demanded by the representative household during each period t =
0, 1, 2, . . .. Note that (12) and (20), describing the representative household’s optimizing
behavior, imply that
Λ1t = rt Λ3t

21

(44)

for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Substituting (44), together with (14) and (15), into (10) then yields
Λ2t
= [v n (rt − 1)1−ω + (1 − v n )(rt − rtd )1−ω ]1/(1−ω) .
Λ3t

(45)

Define the own rate of return rta on the monetary aggregate Mta with reference to the righthand side of (45):

rt − rta = [v n (rt − 1)1−ω + (1 − v n )(rt − rtd )1−ω ]1/(1−ω) .

(46)

Equations (44)-(46) then allow (17) and (19) to be combined to obtain

(52)

and

use Barnett’s (1978) formula to define the user costs uat , unt and udt of the monetary aggregate
Mta , currency Nt , and deposits Dt .
Equation (47) takes the form of a demand curve for the monetary aggregate Mta , which
22

having been derived from a shopping-time specification has the real wage as well as consumption as its scale variables, a result that echoes Karni’s (1973), and has rt − rta as its
opportunity cost term. Meanwhile, (48) and (49) show how the household’s optimal choices
of currency and deposits in creating the monetary aggregate depend on the share parameter
v n as well as the user cost of each monetary asset relative to the whole. These equations
also help foreshadow many of the quantitative results to follow and provide yet another
perspective on the possibilities opened up by the extra degree of freedom the monetary authority obtains when it can pay interest on reserves. From (51), movements in the market
rate of interest rt , brought about as the monetary authority follows the Taylor rule (41),
translate into variations in the user cost of currency. Equation (52) shows that the user
cost of deposits depends, as well, on the opportunity cost rt − rtd , which by (39) can be
manipulated separately by the monetary authority through variations in the interest rate rtv
it pays on reserves. Thus, this general equilibrium model reveals how the extra degree of
freedom identified by Goodfriend (2002), Ennis and Weinberg (2007), and Keister, Martin,
and McAndrews (2008) allows the central bank to vary the relative prices of currency and
deposits as competing media of exchange, triggering shifts in households’ portfolios of liquid
assets.
While the true monetary aggregate Mta and its user cost uat are well-defined and observable within the model, their magnitudes depend not only on the quantities of currency and
deposits but also on functional forms and parameters that may not be known to outside
agents, including analysts at the monetary authority and applied econometricians more generally. Belongia and Ireland (2012) show, however, that in a model like this one, but without
interest on reserves, movements in both the true aggregate and its user cost are approximated
very closely by movements in Divisia price and quantity indices for monetary services like
those proposed by Barnett (1980); and the advantage of these Divisia aggregates is that they
can be constructed without reference to unknown functional forms and parameters. Until
2006, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compiled and released data on these monetary

23

services indices, building closely on Barnett’s work as described by Anderson, Jones, and Nesmith (1997a, 1997b); below, therefore, data on the St. Louis Fed’s monetary services price
and quantity indices will be used as proxies for Mta and uat . The more familiar, simple-sum
aggregate
Mts = Nt + Dt

(53)

is, of course, constructed quite easily both in the model and the data; it, too, does not
depend on unknown parameters, and in the extended model developed here it can be used
to keep track of total deposits Dt and not just deposits Dth owned by households.
Two other monetary variables considered below are the reserve ratio and the monetary
base. The former can be measured in the usual way, dividing bank reserves by deposits:

rrt = Ntv /Dt .

(54)

The latter is measured most easily by observing that since, for simplicity, households in this
model do not carry deposits across periods and banks do not carry reserves across periods
either, the variable Mt that keeps track of the currency possessed by the representative
household at the end of each period t = 0, 1, 2, . . . also equals the monetary base. And since,
within each period, the monetary base gets increased both through the lump-sum transfer
made by the monetary authority to households and the interest payments on reserves made
by the monetary authority to banks, it evolves according to

Mt = Mt−1 + Tt + (rtv − 1)Ntv

for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

24

(55)

2.8

Symmetric Equilibrium

In a symmetric equilibrium, all intermediate goods-producing firms make identical decisions,
so that Yt (i) = Yt , hgt (i) = hgt , Lft (i) = Lft , Dtf (i) = Dtf , Pt (i) = Pt , Ft (i) = Ft , and
Qt (i) = Qt for all i ∈ [0, 1] and t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. In addition, the market-clearing conditions
Bt = 0 and st (i) = 1 for all i ∈ [0, 1] must hold for all t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. After imposing
these conditions (2), (3), (5), (8)-(20), (22)-(34), (37), (38), (40)-(43), (46), (50)-(55) can be
collected together to form a system of 42 equations determining the equilibrium behavior of
the 42 variables Ct , Yt , gt , hst , ht , hgt , hbt , hdt , hvt , Ft , Λ1t , Λ2t , Λ3t , Mt , Tt , Nt , Dt , Dth , Dtf , Lt ,
Lht , Lft , Mta , Ntv , Mts , Pt , Wt , Qt , rtl , rtd , rt , rtv , rta , uat , unt , udt , rrt , vta , at , Zt , xat , and τt .
This system implies that many of these variables will be nonstationary, with real variables
inheriting a unit root from the random walk in the technology shock (23) and nominal
variables inheriting a unit root from the conduct of monetary policy as described by the
Taylor rule (41). However, the real variables become stationary when scaled by the lagged
technology shock Zt−1 and the nominal variables become stationary when expressed in growth
rates. When the 42-equation system is rewritten in terms of these appropriately-transformed
variables, it implies that the economy has a balanced growth path, along which all of the
stationary variables remain constant at steady-state values in the absence of shocks. The
transformed system can therefore be log-linearized around its steady state to form a set
of linear expectational difference equations that can be solved using methods outlined by
Blanchard and Kahn (1980) and Klein (2000).

Results
Calibration

Numerical implementation of the solution procedure just described requires that specific
values be assigned to each of the model’s 30 parameters: χ, β, η, θ, ω, ν, φd , φp , φv , π, ρr ,

25

ρπ , ρg , α, τ , v a , v n , z, xa , xn , ρav , ρa , ρax , ρτ , σva , σa , σz , σxa , στ , and σr . Hence, the exercise
continues by calibrating a version of the model without interest on reserves to match various
statistics from the United States economy, mainly during the period extending from the
fourth quarter of 1987 through the third quarter to 2008. This sample period starts with the
appointment of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve Chairman and continues through Ben
Bernanke’s term until the onset of the financial crisis; throughout this period, likewise, the
Federal Reserve did not pay interest on reserves.
Although the cost channel will be reintroduced later, when assessing the robustness of the
results, the benchmark calibration sets φd = 0, to keep the model as close to the standard New
Keynesian framework as possible. This initial choice implies that (47) describes the aggregate
demand for monetary services, so that −1/(1 + χ) measures the elasticity of money demand
with respect to the opportunity cost variable rt − rta , and this coefficient on the opportunity
cost term is equal in absolute value to the coefficient on the real wage, which in turn equals
one minus the coefficient on consumption. Using data on the M2 monetary services quantity
index and the associated price index compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to
measure Mta and rt − rta , as well as data on real personal consumption expenditures and
the associated chain-type price index from the National Income and Product Accounts to
measure Ct and Pt and the index of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector
assembled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for its report on Productivity and Costs to
measure Wt , an ordinary least squares regression of this form, with all of the parameter
constraints imposed, yields

ln(Mta /Pt ) = −4.4 + 0.83 ln(Ct ) + 0.17 ln(Wt /Pt ) − 0.17 ln(rt − rta ),

suggesting a calibrated value of χ = 5. Since the St. Louis Fed discontinued its monetary
services series in 2005:4, the data used to estimate this equation run from 1987:4 through
2005:4. Likewise, (48) indicates that the parameter ω measuring the elasticity of substitution

26

between currency and deposits in creating the monetary aggregate Mta can be calibrated
based on a regression of the ratio of currency to the M2 monetary services index on the ratio
of the user cost associated with M2 monetary services to the user cost of currency. Again,
these data are available from the St. Louis Fed from 1987:4 through 2005:4 and yield the
estimated equation
ln(Nt /Mta ) = −6.7 + 0.53 ln(uat /unt ),
suggesting the calibrated value ω = 0.50. Note that this setting for ω makes the elasticity of
substitution between currency and deposits smaller than that implied by the Cobb-Douglas
specification that represents the special case of (4) with ω = 1. In principle, a setting for ν,
measuring the elasticity of substitution between reserves and labor in deposit creation, might
be pinned down from a detailed study of bank productivity, but a search of the literature
yielded no estimate covering the 1987-2008 period. Introspection suggests that there is likely
to be very little substitutability between these two quite different inputs, however, and the
calibrated value ν = 0.25 reflects this idea.
Data on the federal funds rate and the growth rates of the GDP deflator and real GDP,
1987:4-2008:3, yield ordinary least squares estimates of the coefficient of the Taylor rule (41):

ln(rt ) = −0.0018 + 0.95 ln(rt−1 ) + 0.20 ln(πt−1 ) + 0.13 ln(gt−1 ),

suggesting the settings ρr = 0.95, ρπ = 0.20, and ρg = 0.15. Of course, under the benchmark
regime where interest is not paid on reserves, (42) and (43) get specialized by setting α = 0
and τ = 1. The analysis below considers two alternative policy regimes under which interest
does get paid on reserves. In the first alternative, α = 1 and τ = 1 − 0.000625; under this
policy, the monetary authority maintains an average spread of 25 basis points between the
market rate of interest rt and the interest rate on reserves rtv when both rates are expressed
in annualized terms. In the second alternative regime, α = 1 and τ = 1, so that interest gets
paid on reserves at the market rate.

27

Interpreting each period in the model as a quarter year in real time, the settings z = 1.005
and π = 1.005 imply an annualized, steady-state growth rate for real, per-capita variables
of 2 percent and an annualized, steady-state inflation rate of 2 percent as well. Given these
choices, the setting β = 0.995 then implies a steady-state market rate of interest of about
6 percent per year. The settings θ = 6 and φp = 50, drawn from previous work by Ireland
(2000, 2004a, 2004b), make the steady-state markup of price over marginal cost equal to 20
percent and, as explained in Ireland (2004a), imply a speed of price adjustment in this model
with quadratic price adjustment costs that is the same as the speed of price adjustment in a
model with staggered price setting following Calvo’s (1983) specification in which individual
goods’ prices are adjusted, on average, every 3.75 quarters, that is, just slightly more often
than once per year.
Values for the next six parameters, η, v a , v n , xa , xn , and φv , get selected to match six facts.
First, the steady-state value of hours worked equals 0.33, meaning that the representative
household allocates 1/3 of its time to labor. Second, the steady-state ratio of the simplesum monetary aggregate Mts to nominal consumption Pt Ct equals 3, matching the fact that
during the 1987:4-2008:3 period, the average ratio of simple-sum M2 to quarterly nominal
personal consumption expenditures equals 3.04; since the St. Louis Fed’s monetary services
indices are just that, namely index numbers for monetary services, they track growth rates
not levels and therefore cannot be used to match the ratio of Mta to Pt Ct in the model.
Third, the steady-state ratio of currency to deposits equals 0.10, approximating the fact
that the average ratio of currency to deposits in simple-sum M2 equals 0.1077. Fourth, the
steady-state ratio of reserves to deposits equals 0.02, matching the fact that the average
ratio of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis adjusted reserves to simple-sum deposits in M2
equals almost exactly 0.02. Fifth, the steady-state ratio of employment in banking to total
employment equals 0.007, or seven-tenths of one percent. In data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics’ Current Employment Survey, 1.4 percent of all workers on total nonfarm payrolls
were employed in depository credit intermediation on average over the period from 1990

28

through 2011. Of course, those employees engaged in a range of banking activities that
extends beyond deposit creation; hence, the smaller, 0.7 percent figure is taken as the one
to be matched by the model. Sixth, in data covering 2008:4 through 2011:4, the ratio of
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis adjusted reserves to simple-sum deposits in M2 averaged
15 percent. During most of that period, the Federal Reserve paid interest on reserves at a
rate intended to match the federal funds rate. Based on these observations, φv is chosen so
that in the steady state of the model in which α = 1 and τ = 1, so that interest is paid on
reserves at the market rate, the ratio of reserves to deposits equals 15 percent.
Searching over various parameter combinations with these targets in mind leads to the
settings η = 2.5, v a = 0.90, v n = 0.20, xa = 65, xn = 0.75, and φv = 0.000005. These
parameter values also imply, through the relationship shown in (39), a steady-state spread
between the market rate of interest rt and the deposit rate rtd equal in annualized terms to
0.97 percent, just below one percentage point. In United States data, 1987:4-2008:3, the
average spread between the three-month Treasury bill rate and the own rate of return on the
deposit component of M2 equals 1.22 percent. Hence, the model and the data are not too
far out of line along this added dimension; indeed, that the spread between the bond and
deposit rates in the data exceeds the same spread in the model provides reassurances that
the real resource cost of deposit creation in the model is based on a conservative estimate.
Intriguingly, the strictly positive setting for φv in the cost specification (31) for managing
reserves allows, as revealed by (37), for the existence of equilibria not only when the interest
rate on reserves rtv equals the market rate rt but also when rtv rises slightly above rt . The
model is therefore consistent, at least to an extent, with the puzzling fact that contrary to
the intentions specified in the Federal Reserve Board’s (2008) press release, the federal funds
rate has actually fallen below the interest rate on reserves for much of the period between
2008:4 and 2011:4. It should be noted, however, that the very small value assigned to φv
implies that the model can account for a negative spread between the market rate and the
rate on reserves of at most 0.0017 basis points. Hence, more likely, the institutional factors

29

described, modeled, and analyzed by Bech and Klee (2011) explain why the interest rate on
reserves has not worked perfectly in placing a hard floor beneath the federal funds rate.
Since the technology shock in (23) follows a random walk with drift, it is highly persistent
by assumption. The settings ρav = 0.95 and ρa = 0.95 make the shocks to the demand for
monetary services and preferences highly persistent as well. The additional settings ρax = 0.50
and ρτ = 0.50 introduce a more modest amount of persistence in the shocks to productivity
in the banking system and to the spread between the market interest rate and the interest
rate paid on reserves. Since most of the analysis that follows focuses on impulse responses
from the log-linearized model, the settings σva = 0.01, σa = 0.01, and σz = 0.01 are really just
normalizations that make one-standard-deviation money demand, preference, and technology
shocks, equivalently, into one-percentage-point shocks. The setting σr = 000625, however,
means that the monetary policy shock leads to a 25-basis-point change in the annualized,
short-term interest rate. The setting στ = 0.0003125 is half that size, so that the rate
of interest paid on reserves remains below the market rate of interest after a one-standarddeviation shock to the interest rate spread, even under the alternative policy considered below
in which α = 1 and τ = 1 − 0.000625, so that the monetary authority maintains an average
25-basis-point spread between the annualized market rate of interest and the annualized
interest rate on reserves. Finally, the setting σxa = ln(10) is used below to capture some of
the effects of a financial crisis, in which an adverse shock reduces the productivity of reserves
and labor in producing bank deposits by an entire order of magnitude.

3.2

Equilibrium Determinacy

The larger size of this model with currency, deposits, and banks precludes the derivation
of analytic results like those obtained by Woodford (2003) and Bullard and Mitra (2005),
identifying conditions on the coefficients of Taylor rules like (41) that ensure the determinacy
of rational expectations equilibria in smaller-scale New Keynesian models. Numerical analysis indicates, however, that for this model, familiar conditions for determinacy apply, both
30

with and without interest on reserves. Specifically, a grid search over 2001 evenly-spaced
values for ρr between 0 and 2, 2001 evenly-spaced values for ρπ between 0 and 2, and 11
evenly-spaced values for ρg between 0 and 1, making a total of more than 44 million cases
in all, reveals that for all three policy regimes described above, without interest on reserves
(α = 0 and τ = 1), with interest paid on reserves at an annualized rate that is, on average,
25 basis points below the market rate (α = 0 and τ = 1 − 0.000625), and with interest paid
on reserves at the market rate (α = 1 and τ = 1), the exact same condition

ρr + ρπ > 1

(56)

is both necessary and sufficient on the grid for the system to have a unique dynamically
stable rational expectations equilibrium according to the criteria of Blanchard and Kahn
(1980). Condition (56), of course, requires the monetary authority to satisfy what Woodford
(2003) calls the “Taylor principle,” increasing the short-term market rate of interest more
than proportionally in response to any change in inflation. This result – that the Taylor
principle continues to hold even when interest is paid on reserves – reinforces the interpretation suggested above, in reference to (37) depicting the representative bank’s demand for
reserves. In this dynamic model, the additional degree of freedom that the monetary authority obtains from the ability to pay interest on reserves is most appropriately described as
one that allows the central bank to target the real quantity of reserves separately from the
market rate of interest. The dynamic properties of the short-term interest rate, therefore,
remain essential for determining uniquely the dynamic paths for prices and other nominal
variables.
Thus, the payment of interest on reserves, at a rate below or equal to the market rate, does
not give rise to special problems of equilibrium determinacy in this New Keynesian model as
it appears to in the overlapping generations models studied by Sargent and Wallace (1985)
and Smith (1991). Hornstein’s (2010) more detailed analysis of equilibrium determinacy in

31

a flexible-price, money-in-the-utility function model indicates that these differences can be
traced back to the specification of fiscal as well as monetary policies in Sargent and Wallace’s
and Smith’s earlier models. Borrowing Leeper’s (1991) terminology, Hornstein points out
that indeterminacy prevails in Sargent and Wallace’s and Smith’s models in cases where both
monetary and fiscal policies are “passive” in that monetary policy fails to respond vigorously
to changes in prices and fiscal policy fails to respond vigorously to changes in government
debt. Hornstein goes on to demonstrate that a unique, stable equilibrium, with or without
interest on reserves, is pinned down in his model, just as in the model with sticky prices used
here, when an “active” monetary policy rule that satisfies the Taylor principle is combined
with a passive fiscal policy that leaves government taxes and transfers to be determined,
endogenously, so as to support the given interest rate path.
It should be noted, again, that the small but positive labor cost (31) of managing larger
stocks of reserves plays a key role in this model, to allow an equilibrium in which interest
on reserves is paid at the market rate to exist in the first place. Without this additional
cost, (37) confirms that banks’ demand for reserves will be unboundedly large, exactly as
anticipated by Sargent and Wallace (1985). On the other hand, one version of Hornstein’s
(2010) specification resembles the case illustrated in panel (b) of figure 1, in which there is a
satiation point beyond which banks are indifferent between holding any level of reserves once
the opportunity cost of doing so equals zero. In this case, Hornstein shows that a unique
equilibrium can still be determined if the monetary authority adopts, in addition to the rule
for managing the market rate of interest and, in lockstep, the interest rate on reserves, a rule
for managing the real stock of reserves or, equivalently, the monetary base. This additional
policy rule plays the same role in Hornstein’s model that the small cost of managing reserves
does here: it makes the real quantity of reserves uniquely-determined when interest is paid
on reserves at the market rate, while having little or no impact on the behavior of other
equilibrium values. Further, in both this model and in Hornstein’s, these extra mechanisms
for ensuring determinacy could be eliminated if the monetary authority lowers the rate of

32

interest it pays on reserves ever so slightly below the market rate; here, an arbitrarily small
but still positive interest rate spread would work, through (37), in exactly the same way as
the arbitrarily small but positive labor requirement measured by the parameter φv , to keep
the demand for real reserves finite and well-defined.

3.3

The Steady-State Effects of Paying Interest on Reserves

Table 1 compares the steady-state values of a range of variables under the benchmark policy
that does not pay interest on reserves to the steady-state values of the same variables under
the alternative policies of paying interest on reserves, either at a rate that, in annualized
terms, lies 25 basis points below the market rate or that coincides with the market rate. In the
model, the steady-state rate of output growth gets pinned down by the rate of technological
change, as measured by the parameter z in (23), describing the process for the technology
shock. The steady-state rate of inflation gets chosen by the monetary authority at the same
it fixes the coefficients of the Taylor rule (41). The steady-state market rate of interest
then gets determined by the Fisher relationship: it gross terms, it equals the product of the
inflation rate π and the real interest rate z/β. Hence, the first three rows of table 1 confirm
that none of those steady-state values depends on whether or not interest is paid on reserves.
Instead, a decision by the monetary authority to pay interest on reserves has its steadystate effects on banks’ demand for real reserves as described by (37) and, through the pricing
relationship shown in (39), the interest rate that banks pay on deposits. Changes in the
deposit rate then set off portfolio adjustments by households, which given the shoppingtime specification (3)-(5) also have implications for the levels of output and hours worked.
Not surprisingly, table 1 reveals that the biggest effects in percentage terms are on banks’
holdings of real reserves, which more than double moving from the steady state without
interest on reserves to the steady state in which interest is paid at a 25-basis-point spread
and rise by nearly a factor of eight when interest is paid at the market rate. The technological
specification (31) implies that the amount of labor that banks use to manage reserves rises
33

proportionally to changes in the stock of reserves; hence, table 1 shows that large percentage
changes in hvt also appear across steady states. In all cases, however, the very small value for
the parameter φv selected above implies that the management of reserves requires nonzero
but extremely small resource costs.
Competitive pressures in the banking system imply, through (39), that reductions in
banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves brought about by the payment of interest on
reserves get passed along to households in the form of higher deposit rates. Table 1 shows
that, in particular, the annualized interest rate on deposits rises by 15 or 16 basis points,
depending on whether the interest rate on reserves is held 25 basis points below or set equal
to the market rate of interest. These changes seem modest when quoted by themselves, but
imply sizable reductions in the user cost of deposits, which according to Barnett’s (1978)
formula (52) depends not on the level of the deposit rate but rather on the spread between
the market and deposit rates. Hence, according to the relationships (47)-(49), households
shift out of currency and into deposits when interest gets paid on reserves, and their overall
demand for monetary services as reflected in the real value of the true monetary aggregate Mta
increases as well. These effects serve to reinforce the second interpretation, suggested above
with reference to the user cost formulas (51) and (52), that by adjusting the interest rate
rtv it pays on reserves, the central bank can use its extra degree of freedom to influence the
relative prices that household’s face in choosing between currency and deposits as competing
media of exchange. Table 1 also shows that shopping time, while always small relative to
the household’s other time commitments, falls by 8 or 9 percent across steady states when
interest gets paid on reserves.
In this shopping-time model as in Cooley and Hansen’s (1989) cash-in-advance model and
Belongia and Ireland’s (2006) real business cycle model with currency and deposits, inflation
acts as a tax on market activity, since households must use monetary assets that pay interest
at below-market rates to purchase consumption but do not receive nominal wages payments
in exchange for their labor until the end of each period. But while both of those previous

34

studies examine how changes in the inflation rate π affect the magnitude of the inflation tax
as a whole, here, instead, the focus lies on how a single component of the inflation tax gets
reduced through the payment of interest on reserves. Under the benchmark policy of no
interest on reserves, reserves are small when compared to both the monetary base and the
level of deposits. Hence, the incremental inflation-tax effects of paying interest on reserves
are small as well: as shown in table 1, total hours worked and aggregate output rise by only
one-tenth of a percentage point when interest gets paid on reserves.
These small changes still imply, however, that there are welfare gains from paying interest
on reserves. The last row of table 1 quantifies these gains, by showing how the representative
household’s steady-state utility rises moving from the benchmark policy of no interest on
reserves to the alternatives in which interest is paid on reserves. To place these numbers in
some perspective, the table also reports the permanent, percentage changes in consumption
that generate equivalent changes in utility. In particular, the table shows that moving from
the benchmark of no interest on reserves to the regime where interest is paid at a rate that
is 25 basis points below the market rate yields a welfare gain equivalent to that provided
by a permanent 0.0275 percent increase in consumption; moving from the benchmark to the
alternative where interest is paid at the market rate yields a gain equivalent to a permanent
0.0300 percent increase in consumption. Thus, while Goodfriend (2002), Ennis and Weinberg
(2007), and Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008) identify a variety of other, potentially
more important, ways through which the payment of interest on reserves can help banks
operate more efficiently, the model used here does provide an additional, albeit modest,
rationale for the Federal Reserve’s decision to pay interest on reserves.

3.4

The Dynamic Effects of Macroeconomic Shocks

Figure 2 plots the impulse responses of output Yt , the aggregate price level Pt , the market rate
of interest rt , and reserves Ntv to one-standard-deviation innovations to the preference shock
at , the technology shock Zt , and the monetary policy shock εrt , both under the benchmark
35

policy without interest on reserves (solid lines) and the alternative policy of paying interest
on reserves at a rate that lies 25 basis points below the market rate (dashed lines). Since the
impulse response for the case where the central bank pays interest on reserves at the market
rate resemble so closely those for the case with the 25-basis-point spread, results for this
third case are not shown. The panels express output, the price level, and nominal reserves
in logs and the interest rate in annualized percentage-point terms.
The preference shock acts as an exogenous, non-monetary, demand-side disturbance,
increasing both output and prices and, under the Taylor rule (41) calling forth a tightening
of monetary policy in the form of higher interest rates. The technology shock increases
output and decreases the price level. The random walk specification (23) implies that the
technology shock’s effect on the level of output is permanent, and the implied short-run
increase in output growth dominates the decrease in inflation so that, under the Taylor rule,
the monetary authority responds with a modest, 8-basis-point increase in the market rate
of interest. Finally, the monetary policy shock generates a 25-basis-point increase in the
market rate of interest that, in this purely forward-looking model, begins to reduce output
and prices immediately. The implied movements in output growth and inflation then lead
the interest rate, through the Taylor rule, back quite quickly to its steady-state value, despite
the large setting ρr = 0.95 for the interest rate smoothing coefficient in (41). These are the
variables and shocks that hold center stage in most New Keynesian analysis, and here they
display their usual behavior.
The new results shown in figure 2 can be summarized by observing that, in each of the
first three rows, the solid and dashed lines overlap, so much so that they are indistinguishable.
While, in fact, the changes in the market rate of interest shown in the third row do give
rise to changes in banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves under the benchmark policy
without interest on reserves but not under the alternative in which the positive interest
rate on reserves tracks changes in the market rate to maintain the 25-basis-point spread,
and while, in principle, these differences in the cost of holding reserves might translate into

36

variable inflation tax effects that then impact differently on output and inflation as well,
these effects turn out, quantitatively, to be very small. These results for the model’s output
and price dynamics echo those for the steady states described earlier in table 1.
Again as in table 1, however, measures of money, particularly bank reserves, behave
quite differently across policy regimes. Although, in the fourth row of figure 2, important
differences appear in the aftermath of all three macroeconomic shocks, they are most striking
in the case of a monetary policy shock. In the traditional case in which interest is not paid
on reserves, the monetary authority must drain reserves from the banking system in order
to bring about the desired liquidity effect: the 25-basis-point increase in the market rate
of interest. When interest is paid on reserves, however, the change in reserves required to
generate the 25-basis-point increase in the market rate differs not just in magnitude but in
sign: the monetary authority must initially expand the nominal supply of reserves to prevent
the market interest rate from rising even more.
Equation (39) helps, once again, in explaining this surprising result. In the model, banks
create deposits with a combination of reserves and labor. Hence, as shown in (39), the
wedge between the market rate and the competitively-determined interest rate on deposits
depends both on the opportunity cost of holding reserves rt − rtv and the real wage relative to
productivity (Wt /Pt )/Zt . Without interest on reserves, the rise in the market rate increases
the opportunity cost term, more than offsetting the decline in the real wage brought about by
the contractionary macroeconomic effects of the monetary policy shock. When the monetary
authority increases rtv in lockstep with rt , so as to maintain a constant spread between the
two, the opportunity cost of holding reserves gets held fixed and the only effect that remains
works through the decline in wages, so that the spread rt − rtd declines, as does the user cost
of deposits given by (52). Figure 3 displays these differences in the response of the user cost
of deposits and also shows how, as a consequence, households substitute more strongly into
deposits after a monetary policy shock in the case where interest is paid on reserves. Hence,
the liquidity effect vanishes entirely when interest is paid on reserves: because the increase in

37

the market interest rate has general equilibrium effects on households’ demand for deposits
and banks’ demand for reserves, the market interest rate and the quantity of reserves move
together, in the short run, when interest is paid on reserves.
Still, both with and without interest on reserves, the Taylor rule (41) associates a contractionary monetary policy shock with a transitory fall in inflation but a permanent decline
in the aggregate price level. Hence, moving back to figure 2, the bottom, right-hand panel
shows that even when the monetary authority pays interest on reserves, it must in the longrun contract the supply of reserves after a monetary policy shock. So while the dynamic
behavior of reserves differs dramatically depending on whether or not interest is paid on
reserves, the long-run effects coincide: a monetary policy action that decreases the price
level always requires a proportional reduction in the nominal supply of reserves. These results suggest, once again, that the additional degree of freedom that the monetary authority
obtains when it can pay interest on reserves is best interpreted as one that, in the long run,
influences the real, as opposed to the nominal, quantity of reserves. At the same time, however, these results highlight how moving to a policy of paying interest on reserves requires
sometimes dramatic changes in short-run operating procedures that go well beyond those
that can be illustrated in simple, static diagrams like those from figure 1.

3.5

The Effects of Financial Shocks

Figure 4 repeats the impulse response analysis from figure 2, but for the remaining three
shocks to money demand vta , bank productivity xat , and the spread τt between the market
rate and the interest rate paid on reserves. The left-hand column confirms that Poole’s
(1970) classic result, showing that by holding the market rate of interest fixed in the face
of shocks to money demand, the monetary authority automatically accommodates the shifts
in demand with appropriate shifts in the supply of liquid assets and thereby insulates the
macroeconomic from effects of those disturbances, carries over to this setting just as it does to
the simpler New Keynesian model studied by Ireland (2000). In particular, the figure shows
38

how, under the Taylor rule (41), the supply of reserves increases to meet the additional
demand generated by an increase in vta , leaving output, inflation, and the market rate of
interest virtually unchanged.
The calibrated value σxa is selected above to make the banking productivity shock very
large and thereby simulate the effects of a severe disruption to the financial system that
makes it much more difficult for private financial institutions to supply households with
highly liquid assets like bank deposits. Hence, the middle column of figure 4 traces out the
effects of an adverse shock of this kind, that is, a negative one-standard-deviation innovation
to xat . The bottom panel shows how the monetary authority floods the economy with reserves
to partially offset the negative effects of this shock. Nevertheless, in the top row, output still
falls by one percent. These effects appear much the same, regardless of whether or not the
monetary authority pays interest on reserves. Evidently, what matters most in shaping the
effects of this financial-sector shock is how the monetary authority expands the supply of
reserves, while (37) indicates, to the contrary, that changes in the rate of interest on reserves
work mainly to change the demand for reserves.
Finally, the right-hand column of figure 4 shows the effects of a 12.5-basis-point increase
in the interest rate that the monetary authority pays on reserves. The solid line in the
bottom panel shows that starting from the benchmark case in which no interest gets paid on
reserves, this small and temporary increase in the interest rate on reserves has only modest
effects on the demand for reserves and can therefore be supported by a small increase in
reserve supply. Starting from the alternative case in which there is a 25-basic-point spread
between the market rate of interest and the interest rate on reserves, however, this same
shock cuts banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves in half, and therefore sets off much
larger changes in monetary variables, including the supply of reserves. Figure 4 also confirms
that once again, changes in the interest rate paid on reserves have very small effects on output
and inflation.

39

3.6

Robustness

Running through all of the results displayed in table 1 and figures 2-4 is the basic finding that
while the monetary authority’s decision to pay interest on reserves can have very important
effects on both the steady-state levels and dynamic behavior of reserves and other monetary
variables, the effects on output and inflation are by contrast quite small. Behind these results
lie some very basic features of the contemporary United States economy, which are reflected
in the model’s calibration. In the United States prior to 2008, when the Federal Reserve
paid no interest on reserves, the stock of reserves was small, relative to both the monetary
base and the level of deposits. Moreover, inflation and market rates of interest remained low
and stable. Putting these two sets of facts together: with a small tax base as measured by
the stock of reserves and a low tax rate as measured by the market rate of interest relative
to the zero rate of interest paid on reserves, the distortionary effects on the macroeconomic
stemming from banks’ demand for reserves were modest and, therefore, the effects of changes
in the opportunity cost of holding reserves more modest still.
The robustness of these findings is confirmed, for example, by the results shown in figure
5, which reintroduces the cost channel into the model by resetting the parameter φd from
the representative intermediate goods-producing firms deposits-in-advance constraint (25)
equal to one, while holding all other parameters fixed at their benchmark values. Under
this alternative parameterization, the ratio of deposits held by firms to deposits held by
households is just slightly less than 0.30 in the steady state without interest on reserves.
Over the period from 1987:3 through 2008:3, the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds data show
that the ratio of deposits held by nonfinancial businesses to deposits held by households
and nonprofit organizations was just slightly less than 0.21. Hence, the adjusted value
φd = 1 leads the model to overstate the importance of firms’ holdings of liquid assets.
Moreover, since with all the other parameter values held fixed, households continue to hold
the same level of deposits as under the benchmark parameterization, this example overstates
the importance of deposits economywide as well: the steady-state ratio of the simple-sum
40

monetary aggregate Mts to nominal consumption Pt Ct , for instance, rises to 3.9, above the
comparable figure of 3 used to guide the benchmark calibration. Nevertheless, figure 5 reveals
that the effects of macroeconomic shocks on output, prices, and interest rates depend little
on whether or not the monetary authority pays interest on reserves.
To show, however, that these basic results reflect, not the inevitable workings of the
model itself, but rather the way in which the model gets calibrated to match the most
relevant aspects of the United States economy, figure 6 displays impulse responses generated
after φd is reset to its benchmark value of zero but two, more important, sets of changes are
made to the model’s parameter values. First, new values v a = 3.75, v n = 0.225, xa = 11,
and xn = 0.98 increase the steady-state ratio of the simple-sum monetary aggregate Mts
to nominal consumption Pt Ct from 3 to 10 and the steady-state ratio of reserves Ntv to
deposits Dt from 0.02 to 0.10, increasing greatly the importance of reserves in creating
deposits and deposits in providing transaction services, while holding constant the steadystate ratio of currency to deposits at 0.10 and the steady-state ratio of employment in
banking to total employment at 0.007, the values used for the benchmark calibration. This
first set of changes, therefore, has the effect of enlarging dramatically the tax base that gets
hit when the monetary authority does not pay interest on reserves. Second, new values
ρr = 0.50, ρπ = 0.75, and ρg = 0 for the coefficients of the Taylor rule (41) make monetary
policy shocks more persistent. Since, when the monetary authority does not pay interest on
reserves, movements in the market rate translate directly into movements in the opportunity
cost of holding reserves, this second set of changes makes swings in the distortionary tax
rate on reserves more persistent as well.
In figure 6, therefore, output responds quite differently to shocks, depending on whether
or not the monetary authority pays interest on reserves. The additional inflation tax effects,
for instance, make the decline in output that follows the monetary policy shock depicted
in the figure’s far right column significantly larger when interest is not paid on reserves.
Likewise, the rise in the market rate of interest that follows a preference shock turns the

41

initial output expansion into a subsequent contraction when interest is not paid on reserves.
These results suggest that, in other economies with different basic features, the monetary
authority’s decision to pay or not to pay interest on reserves might have larger macroeconomic
consequences. But with this alternative calibration just as before, the dynamic behavior of
reserves themselves shifts most dramatically when the monetary authority decides to pay
interest on reserves.

Conclusion

The analysis performed here, with the help of a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium New
Keynesian model, shows that the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to begin paying interest
on reserves is unlikely to have large effects on the behavior of macroeconomic variables, such
as output and inflation, once normal times return. These results serve also to confirm the
basic thrust of arguments advanced, using a variety of quite different models, by Goodfriend
(2002), Ennis and Weinberg (2007), Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008), and Kashyap
and Stein (2012), all suggesting that the ability to manipulate the spread between the federal
funds rate and the interest rate it pays on reserves provides the Fed with an additional degree
of freedom that it can use to expand its policymaking strategies and objectives. Specifically,
the results obtained here show how the Fed can continue to adjust its target for the federal
funds rate to achieve its goals for macroeconomic stabilization, while independently varying
the interest rate on reserves, as necessary, to help enhance the efficiency of and reinforce the
stability of private financial institutions and the financial sector as a whole.
Re-examining these issues using a fully dynamic and stochastic macroeconomic model,
however, sharpens and extends the insights gleaned from this previous work. Results obtained here, for instance, suggest that in the long run, the additional degree of freedom
provided by the ability to pay interest on reserves is best described as one that gives the
Federal Reserve the ability to target the real quantity of reserves separately from the fed-

42

eral funds rate. Even when it pays interest on reserves, the Fed must continue to use open
market operations to adjust the nominal quantity of reserves proportionally, following any
policy action intended to bring about a long-run change in the aggregate price level. On the
other hand, the results obtained here also show that the decision to pay interest on reserves
does require rather dramatic changes in the way in which the Fed manages the supply of
reserves in the short run. In particular, with interest on reserves, the traditional short-run
liquidity effect, associating a monetary policy tightening with higher interest rates brought
about through a reduction in the supply of reserves, vanishes. Instead, as discussed above,
portfolio reallocations by households may actually require the monetary authority to initially
increase the supply of reserves when raising its target for the short-term interest rate.
These results have implications, too, for the Fed as its acts to unwind the unprecedentedly
large policy actions it took during the financial crises of 2008 and the severe recession that
followed. Most obviously, yet perhaps most importantly, the model shows how the steadystate level of reserves held willingly by the banking system can increase enormously when the
monetary authority reduces the opportunity cost of doing so by paying interest on reserves.
Thus, to the extent that the Federal Reserve continues to pay interest on reserves at a rate
that equals or falls just slightly below its target for the federal funds rate, even as it moves
to normalize that target for the federal funds rate, banks’ demand for reserves will remain
permanently higher. It follows that the Fed might leave most or perhaps even all of the
additional dollars in reserves it has injected since mid-2008 to continue circulating within
the banking system without creating any inflation. In fact, the model’s dynamics referred to
above imply that if the Fed begins to raise its target for the federal funds rate while holding
the spread between the funds rate and the interest rate it pays on reserves fixed, private
agents’ portfolio shifts may actually increase banks’ demand for reserves still further in the
economy’s general equilibrium, requiring the Fed to expand the supply of reserves by even
more to prevent interest rates from rising too quickly.
As discussed by Goodfriend (2002, 2011), a decision to continue paying interest on re-

43

serves at rates close to the federal funds rate would necessarily reduce the magnitude of the
Fed’s transfers to the United States Treasury as those interest rates rise and, under certain
conditions, might even require the Fed to approach the Treasury for additional funding for
its day-to-day operations, potentially threatening the central bank’s independence. Plosser
(2010) highlights a less direct, but possibly more dangerous channel, through which a policy
of paying interest on reserves could weaken the Fed’s independence if its greatly enlarged
balance sheet was taken as a signal of an ability and willingness to intervene significantly in
other markets if asked to by Congress or the Treasury. Of course, these public finance and
political economy considerations are absent from the model developed here. To the extent
that they become important in reality, however, the model clearly implies that convergence
back to a steady state with a wider spread between the federal funds rate and the interest
rate on reserves would require large open market operations to re-absorb the immense stocks
of excess reserves now held within the banking system.
Finally, the analysis shows how these results, particularly those having to do with the
small macroeconomic effects of paying interest on reserves, depend on some specific features
of the United States economy. Before 2008, in the years leading up to the Fed’s decision
to begin paying interest on reserves, banks operated successfully with fairly small stocks of
reserves. Moreover, inflation, interest rates, and by extension banks’ opportunity cost of
holding reserves, remained low as well. With a relatively small base taxed at a relatively low
rate to begin with, incremental changes in the opportunity cost of holding reserves, brought
about through independent variations in the policy rate paid on reserves, have only modest
effects outside the banking system. Building on this same intuition, however, the model
also demonstrates how, in other economies where banks operate less efficiently and market
rates of interest are higher on average, paying interest on reserves may have more profound
macroeconomic consequences.
Although the model developed here reveals and highlights various aspects of the macroeconomic effects of these new policies, it abstracts from many important features of the

44

banking and payments systems that might justify further the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to begin paying interest on reserves. Elaborating on the model in future research, so as
to incorporate more of these institutional features, would surely yield additional insights and
would serve, as well, to bring the analysis into closer contact with the complementary efforts

Notes: Each row shows the steady-state value of the variable indicated under the benchmark policy of no interest on reserves and the alternative
policies of paying interest on reserves either at an annualized rate that is 25 basis points below the annualized market rate or at the market rate.
“Percentage Change” refers to the percentage change in the steady-state value of each variable under each alternative policy with interest on
reserves compared to the value of the same variable under the benchmark policy of no interest on reserves, except starred (∗ ) entries that show
percentage-point changes in annualized inflation and interest rates and double-starred (∗∗ ) entries that convert differences in utility into equivalent,
permanent percentage changes in consumption.
