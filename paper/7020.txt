Valuing the Reload Features of Executive Stock Options

JEL No. C80, D84, J33, M12, M41
ABSTRACT

Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, the grant date value of
executive stock options excludes the value of any reload feature because, at the time of writing the
standard in 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board believed it was notfeasible to value a
reload feature at the grant date. We show how the Binomial Option Pricing Model can be used to

determine the grant date value of such options. Ignoring the reload feature can substantially
understate the value of the option: the reload feature increases the value of anotherwise similar
option by 24 percent in the example we consider. In view of the potential significance of the reload
feature and the versatility of the Binomial Option Pricing Model, the Financial AccountingStandards

Board may wish to reconsider the accounting for options with a reload feature.

INTRODUCTION
Some executive stock options have features that conventional exchange-traded

and over-the-counter options do not. These features may alter significantly the value
of executive stock option grants compared to conventional options. Yet, for the reload
feature, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 1995 recommended

delaying estimation of the feature's value:'
The Board continues to believe that, ideally, the value of an option

with a reload feature should be estimated at the grant date, taking
into account all of its features. However, at this time, it is not feasible to do so. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the best way to

account for an option with a reload feature is to treat both the initial
grant and each subsequent grant of a reload option separately. (Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, ¶186, p. 61)
However, as Arnason and Jagannathan (1994) show, executive stock options and the

reload feature can be valued using the Binomial Option Pricing method.
The Binomial Option Pricing Model (Cox et al., 1979) is sufficiently versatile to

value executive stock options with a reload feature at the time of the initial grant. We

of times. We demonstrate the method using a Norwest Corporation option grant with
a single reload. In this example, the value of the option with the reload feature is 24%
more than the value of the same option without the reload feature. We further explain
how our method generalizes to handle additional features of reload options including
options for which the number of reloads is unrestricted. Accordingly, the full value of

an option with a reload feature can be valued at the grant date.
A reload feature is a provision that stipulates new optious are granted to an executive at the time the executive exercises the original options. The reload options typically have an exercise price equal to the then-current market price and expire at the
same time as the original options. The number of reload options granted per option exercised varies by firm. Commonly, a reload option is granted for each share tendered by
the executive in payment of the exercise price on the original options.2 Sometimes the
new options themselves may be reloaded. Hence, a comprehensive valuation procedure

requires that both the number of reloads allowed and the number of options granted per
existing option exercised be taken into account. The procedure must also anticipate that
a reload feature affects the timing of exercise of the initial option. The Black--Scholes
fornmula cannot provide an accurate measure of the value of a reload feature since it nei-

ther anticipates optimal early exercise nor assigns value to the reloaded options.
2

Under some plans, the stock used to pay thc exercise price must have been held b
the employee for a minimum specified tirrie. Firms may use tins feature to induce executives to hold some
of their wealth in stock iii periods before the executive exercises Ins options. Some reload plans also require
executives to hold shares acquired on exercise for some time after exercise. See Hemmer et al. (1996).

2

Hemmer et al. (1998) show that, if the number of reloads allowed is unrestricted

and a new option is granted for every share tendered in payment of the exercise price,
then it is optimal to exercise whenever the current stock price rises above the exercise

price. This is a useful observation on the optimal exercise policy in this special limiting
case, but many practical questions regarding valuation and optimal exercise strategy

cannot l)e addressed using their approach. Hemmer et al. do not address exercise
i)oliCy when the options may only be reloaded a fixed number of times or when the

number of new options granted differs from the number of shares tendered in payment

of the exercise price. In this paper, we provide an algorithm that determines the grant
date valuation of an option with a reload feature for which the number of reloads is
restricted. The algorithm provides grant date values for any prescribed formula of
new options granted per option exercised. We further show how the algorithm, with
a slight modification, also values options when the number of reloads is unrestricted.

Computationally, this method differs from the one proposed in Hemmer et al., but
provides the same result in the cases they consider.
Section two reports on the prevalence and terms of reload features. Section three
applies the Binomial Option Pricing Model to our example; describes the optimal

exercise policy for an option with a reload feature; and, illustrates how additional

opportunities to reload an option increase its grant-date value. Section four presents
a sensitivity analysis of the value of a reload feature when dividends, volatility. term

varied. Section five discusses some limitations and extensions of the algorithm. Section

six concludes the paper.

PREVALENCE AND TERMS OF RELOAD OPTIONS
Reload features are used by larger firms in almost all areas of business as shown in

tables 1 and 2. flom 1992 to 1997, a rising fraction of all option grants to executives are
grants of reload options (i.e., the original option has been exercised). Firms in which
reload options have been triggered tend to be larger with almost double the annual
sales of other firms. In addition, grants of reload options are more common in financial
services than in other categories. Since finns only report figures for reloads after the

feature is triggered, there must be more options outstanding that have a reload feature

that has not yet been triggered.
The possibility to reload an option increases its value compared with an otherwise

identical option that cannot be reloaded, which we call a conventional option. The
holder of an option with a reload feature benefits since he may exercise existing options

to lock in a gain and still participate in future potential gains. The optimal time to
exercise the original option and the value of the reload feature depend on two key terms

of the option reload provision: (i) the number of times the option may be reloaded, and
(ii) the number of new options granted for each option exercised.

4

There is considerable variation in these terms across reload options. As regards
the number of reloads, Norwest Corporation allows only one reload, First Bank System

allows up to three reloads, and First Clucago places no limit on the number of times
an option may be reloaded. As regards the number of new options granted, Amngen

otters new options equal in number to the shares tendered in payment of the exercise
price, whereas First Bank System and Norwest Bank offer new options granted equal in

number to the shares tendered to pay both the exercise price and any taxes that become
due on exercise.

USING THE BINOMIAL OPTION PRICING MODEL
Overview
Our algorithm is a variation of the standard Binomial Option Pricing Method.3
Fundamental to Binomial Option Pricing Model is the idea that stock price movements
are well-approximated by assuming the stock price can only move to two possible values

in a short interval of tinie. The first step is to construct a price tree that prohahilisticallv describes future stock price movements over time. The time from the grant date to

the expiration of the options is divided into short periods. Over each period, the stock
price is assumed to either rise or fall by a fixed factor with a fixed probability. Every

node in the tree corresponds to a particular time to expiration and stock price level.
See Cox and Rubinstein (1985) for an excellent discussion of the use of Binomial
Opt ion Pricing Model for valuing other complex options.
5

Each node in one time period is connected to two nodes in the next time period, representing a rise or fall in the stock price by a fixed factor. Next, the value of the option
is calculated at each node, working backwards recursively from the expiration date. At

expiration, valuing the option is straightforward. At each earlier node, the value of the
option can be determined from a particular recursive equation that depends only on the
(already computed) values of successor nodes and parameters used to describe the stock

price tree. The value of the option at every node is determined by computing the value

at expiration, and then working backward to nodes one period prior to expiration, then
two periods prior to expiration, and so on.
The recursive equation compares the value of holding the option for one more

period to the value of exercising the option immediately and sets the value at that node
to the larger of these quantities. The value from immediate exercise is the difference
between the market price and the exercise price, plus the expected value of reload
options received on exercise. The value of holding the option until the next period is
the discounted and weighted sum of the value of the option if held one more period in

the case the stock price rises and the value of the option if held one more period in the
case the stock price falls. The weights reflect the likelihood the stock will rise (or fall).

The discount factor is one plus the riskless interest rate. The value of the option on

the gnuit date is the value at the starting node of this tree. Optimal early exercise is
incorporated by assuming that the holder will exercise whenever the value of exercising
6

is higher than the value of holding. Since the decision to exercise or hold is made at each
node, optimal early exercise is embedded in the valuation. By including the value of
reloaded options in the exercise value, the reload feature is embedded in the valuation
as well. A recursive formnla summarizes the calculation.
The appendix provides a simple, 3-period example of the calculations involved in

tlus model.4 For those who wish to implement the algorithm to value the options with

the reload feature, the next section presents the method in detail. The reader can omit
this section without loss of continuity.

Mathematical Development
The Binomial Option Pricing Model uses the Black-Scholes (1973) option valuation

assumptions. In particular, the riskless rate of interest, r, is assumed to be constant
and asset prices are assumed to be lognormally distributed with a constant volatility

rate, a.5 Certain notation and definitions facilitate the description of the binomial

method. Let X he the option's exercise price. Define N to he the total number of
time steps during the life of the option, and T to be the option's time to expiration.

node (i, j) is

By moving backward through time and repeating these computations, the current value

of an American-style option is determined.

This basic method has been used to value conventional options for twenty years.

To generalize the valuation method to handle reloads, it is necessary to write down the

recursive equation that values an option at time i as the greater of the proceeds from

the expected payoff from holding option until the next period, i — 1.

Elaborating on the notation above, let C (rn, S, X) be the value of an option that
may he reloaded i-n times, has grant date stock price S and strike price X, at node
(i. J) in a binomial tree. The value of the an option at node (i, j) is the maximum of the

value of the option if exercised, plus the value of the reload options, if any; and, its value
if held for one more period, which is a weighted discounted sum of the option's value

given either an uptick or downtick. This value can be expressed recursively as

C(m, Si-, X) = max

number of new options granted equals the number of shares needed to pay the exercise

understood that C (—1, S, S) = 0 for all i and j. At expiration, the option must be

C(m,S.X) = max (o,s — x).

In practice, the exercise price of most grants is equal to the stock price on the date of

For premium options (i.e., those that are out-of-the-money on the

date of grant), x is less than one. In this notation, the grant date value of an option
struck at-the-money that cannot be reloaded (i.e., a conventional option) is written
Xc%(O, 1). The function c is interpreted as the value of an option per dollar of the strike
price. Analogous to equation (2), the option's value, per dollar of the inital strike price,
is conveniently rewritten as

Example
We use the example of Mr. B.. Kovacevich, CEO of Norwest Corporation, to illus-

trate valuation of an option with a reload feature using the Binomial Option Pricing
Model. In 1991, Kovacevich was granted 138,000 options to buy stock at $14.53 per
10

share. The options became exercisable in 1994 and have a one-time reload option ifpieviouslv owned shares are used to purchase the option.

Norwest grants reload options equal to the number of shares tendered to pay the
exercise price plus any taxes owed iii connection with the exercise.7 These reload options

have the sanie expiration date as the original options arid an exercise price equal to the
stock price on the (lay the reload feature is triggered. Since only one reload is allowed
the reload options themselves do riot have a reload feature.
If Kovacevich chooses to exercise the options upon vesting in 1994 when the stock
price is $26, he will pay to the corporation 138, 000 x $14.53

$2, 005, 140 and receive

138,000 shares, each worth $26 or $3,588,000 in total. Assuming that the marginal
income tax rate for Kovacevich is 48.1%, the tax payable upon exercising the options
will be 0.481 x ($26—$14.53) x 138,000

$761, 356. If Kovacevich pays the exercise price

and taxes with shares he already owns (each worth $26), lie will have to pay a total of
$2,005,140 + $761,356 = $2,766,496 with 106,404 shares (i.e., $2766,496 divided by $26

per share). Thus. Kovacevich gives up his 138,000 options and 106,404 shares of stock
to the company, and receives in return 138,000 shares of stock and 106,404 new options

with an exercise price of $26 and 7 years to expiration.
Using equation (3) to value the option as of May 1991 requires the following inputs:

the current stock price at the date of the grant, $14.53; the exercise price. $14.53; the

27.3%; and, the risk-free rate, 7% simple interest. We represent stock price movements

over the life of the option nsing a binomial tree with one step per month. If Kovacevich

exercises at node (i,j), he receives Z

option he exercises, since 48.1% is his marginal tax rate,8 The grant-date value of a
conventional option with the above assumptions is $5.23 .Adding the reload feature

increases the option's value by 24% to $6.49. If the executive only receives X/S new
options per original option exercised (i.e., the number of new options granted is not
increased by the amount of taxes the executive on exercise of the original grant), the
reload feature adds 14% to the value of a conventional option.
Figure 1 plots the optimal exercise region in (stock price, time) space assuming

a single reload is allowed on a stock that pays no dividends. The figure shows that

exercise depends on both the stock price level and time remaining to expiration. The
longer the time to expiration, the higher the threshold stock price at which exercise is
opt im al.

Extension to an Unrestricted Number of Reloads
If the number of times the option can be reloaded is unrestricted, a modification
of the recursive equation (3) is required. Let

(A, x) denote an option that may he

reloaded an arbitrary number of times. Simply substituting c (A. ) in (3) \vllerever

c(rn,.) or

—

1,.) appears yields a system that cannot be solved recursively. This

is because c(A. 1) is expressed as a function of itself, as are option values at other nodes
in the tree. The key simplification comes from observing that

c (A, 1)

pc_1(A,1) +

(1

—p)c'1(A,1)

1+r

since the executive is indifferent between holding and exercising an at-the-money option

that can be reloaded an unrestricted number of times. Substituting the right hand side
of this equality wherever the left hand side appears in equation (3) yields

c(A,x) — max

(A,1)
xf(z,j) —1 + Z * pc_1(A,1)+(1—p)c'1
1+r

pc (A,x)+(1—p)c (Ax)
1 +r

which can be solved recursively since (A, x) is expressed in terms of successor nodes

in the tree for all i and j. So, the grant date value can be determined by computing the
values of nodes in a single binomial tree, working backwards from the expiration date.

This means the valuation of an option that may be reloaded an arbitrary number of
times is no more complex computationally than valuing a conventional option using the
binomial method.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
For options with either a 5 or 10-year life, table III presents the value of a reload
option granted-at-the-money for stock volatilities ranging between 20 and 50 percent per
13

year. annual dividend yields ranging from zero to five percent, arid up to five reloads.

An interest rate of 7% is assumed for all calculations. The values in the table are stan-

dardized by the grant date market value of the stock. Thus, reading from the table, the
grant-date value of a 5-year conventional option on a stock paying nO dividend with a
market value of $17 and a volatility of 20% is $17 x .335, or $5.70. Similarly, the grantdate value of an otherwise identical option that may be reloaded five times is $17 x .400.
or $6.80, which is 19% more.

Dividends
Dividends have a large impact on the value of the reload feature. While the value
of the conventional option falls with increases in dividend payout, the value of the reload
feature increases as a percent of the value of the conventional option.

The ratio of reload option value to conventional option value can he used to assess

when the reload feature is most valuable. In contrast to the 19% increase in value
attributable to the reload feature for the option on a no-dividend stock calculated above,
on an otherwise identical stock with a dividend yield of 5%, a 5-year option that may be
reloaded 5 times is worth 28% more than a conventional option since. 226/177

1.28.

Thus, the reload feature is worth more for options on high dividend stocks. Since an
increase in dividends reduces the value of an option, the value of a reload feature as a
percent of the conventional option value increases with increases in dividend yield.9
Reload features are more common in larger companies and financial services busincsHcs. Tbese firms tend to pay higher-than-average dividends.
14

Volatility
The table also reveals that reload features represent a higher fraction of an option's
total value for high volatility stocks. For a low volatility stock paying rio dividend, the
reload feature adds 19% to a conventional option's value, as calculated above. For a high

volatility (a

50%) stock, the reload feature adds 23% to a 5-year coiiventional option's

value since .640/520 =

1.23.

Time to Expiration
Third, the table shows that the reload feature adds more to a conventional option's
value for short-maturity options. Again as calculated above, for a low volatility stock
that pays no dividend, the reload feature adds 19% to a conventional option's value.
For a 10 year option on the same stock, the reload feature adds 11% to a conventional
option's value since .582/.523

1.11.

Number of Reload Options Granted
Wiule the table does not show it, the value of a reload feature increases with the
number of reload options granted. If, in the Norwest example, Kovacevich received

reload options equal in number to the shares required just to pay the exercise price, the
value of such options would be $5.99, 15% higher than an otherwise similar conventional
option. This compares with the $6.49 value of Kovacevich's actual options. 10
10 Using the same kind of analysis it can be showim that reload features are a higher

fraction of total option value for discount options (i.e., options where the strike price is below the graiit-date
stock price) than for premium options.

15

Number of Reloads
The effect of increasing the number of times an option rriay be reloaded on the value
of the option is shown iii figure 2 using the stock parameters of Norwest arid the reload

fhctor, Z, of Kovacevich's options. An option that may reloaded once is worth $1.27 or

24% more than a conventional option. Each additional time the option may be reloaded

adds value to the option but at a decreasing rate: a second opportunity to reload is
worth $0.47 and a third opportunity to reload is worth $0.22. An option that may be
reloaded an arbitrary number of times is worth $7.37, or just $0.20 more than an option

that can be reloaded only three times.

Frequency of Steps in the Algorithm
The accuracy of the valuation increases with the number of times each year that
the binomial tree allows the stock price to vary. All calculations in this paper are based
on binomial steps of one month, i.e., the stock is modeled as varying twelve times

per year. This represents a good tradeoff between accuracy of the valuation and the
processing resources required to compute values. As the number of times the option

may be reloaded grows large, the computation time required to value the option also

grows because each time the option can be reloaded requires an additional tree to be
geiierated. Even for 10 reloads the computational demands are not excessive—all values

presented in this paper were computed on a desktop computer.
16

In summary, the reload feature adds 24% to the value of a conventional option

in our example. In other cases, this amount may he more or less depending on the
characteristics of the underlying stock and the terms of the option. The incremental
value depends on the number of times reloads are allowed, the size of the dividend

payout, the nnmber of years the option is outstanding, the exercise price, the nnmber
of reload options and the volatility of the underlying stock.

LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS
We have implicitly assumed the executive's risk aversion is the same as that of

an average trader in the market who holds the stock, that the executive will remain
employed with the firm throughout the option life, and that neither liquidity needs nor
behavioral decision biases will cause the executive to exercise the option earlier than

our model determines is optimal." Thus, our method values a hypothetical tradable

option that has the reload feature. The value to the executive need not be the same as
the value of a hypothetical tradable option since the executive cannot trade his options;
instead lie must exercise while the holder of a traded option could sell. In addition, there
are legal restrictions that prevent the executive from diversifying away the unsystematic

risk in these options as an independent trader could do. These differences imply that
theoretical models designed to value traded options yield valuations strictly greater than

the value to the executive. '
'' Nevertheless, these factors are likely to he important. See heath et al. (1999) for a

discussion of behavioral factors.
12 See Huddart (1994).

17

On behalf of the corporation, the net cost of the options may be less than the value
to an independent trader who assumes the granting of options does not affect the valne
of the stock. If the executive is likely to exercise the option for any of the reasons listed
above. then the fair value of the option to the employer corporation is reduced.
The purpose of granting options is to provide incentives to the executive to increase
the valne of the firm. In essence, the shareholders give up some share of the pie in order

to increase the overall value of the pie. In addition, when executive stock options are
exercised, the corporation issues new stock diluting current ownership. This paper
ignores these issues. Instead, we calculate the value of an option with a reload feature
ignoring potential feedback from incentives provided by options to the stock price
process.

The method can readily be modified to handle vesting and stock performance
restrictions on exercise,'3 For instance, in the case of time-based vesting restrictions,

in those periods that the options are not exercisable, the value of the option is just the
holding value; the value from exercising is ignored. It is also possible to modify the

model to account for the executive's risk preferences, liquidity needs, and the probability
of employment termination. The difficulties presented by these latter three factors lie

in reliably estimating parameters that capture risk aversion, liquidity needs, and the
likelihood of ternunation. not in implementing the valuation when these parameters are
known.'
13 A typical executive option cannot be exercised prior to vesting. Thus. the option is
forfcitcd if the executive leaves the firm prior to vesting.

" See Carpenter (1998) and Cuny and Jorion (1995).
18

These limitations to analytical valuation methods are not unique to reload options;
they are shared by conventional options, too. SFAS 123 suggests estimating the time to
expiration of options based on historical patterns of exercise.'5 However, as Kulatilaka

and Marcus (1994) point out, this approach can lead to biased estimates of the value.
Hemmer, Matsunaga and Shevlin (1994) show that use of an expected time to exercise

can impart substantial upward bias in the estimated option value. The Binomial Option
Pricing Model can be modified to take these possibilities into account in a way that
avoids these sources of bias.

CONCLUSION
SFAS 123 states, "... ideally, the value of an option with a reload feature should be
estimated at the grant date, taking into account all of its features . . ." (186, p. 61).
However, without a method to estimate its value, the FASB recommended ignoring

the value of the reload feature until a reload grant is triggered (i.e., when the original
option is first exercised). This paper shows how the Binomial Option Pricing Model can

be used to value the reload feature at the date of the initial grant. The reload feature
adds significant value to the underlying option—24% in our example. In view of this,

the Financial Accounting Standards Board may wish to reconsider its recommendation
regarding the valuation of the reload feature.
15 Huddart and Lang (1996) document patterns of exercise and their association to
volatility, past stock price movements, and the lapsing of vesting restrictions.

Our algorithm can also characterizes the optimal exercise policy for options with the
reload feature, as we show in figure I. Knowledge of the optimial exercise policy obviously

has value to the holders of reload options.

Compensation consultants may wish to understand how the valne of the reload fea-

ture varies with the terms of the options and the characteristics of the underlying stock.
The percentage value that a reload feature adds to a conventional option decreases with
the time to expiration; and increases with the numher of reloads allowed, the number

of new options granted at reload, and the ratio of market to strike price of the original
option. Although a compensation committee can customize an option's terms including
the strike price, expiration date, number of reloads and number of new options granted

at reload, the committee generally is unable to alter dividends and volatility. The reload
feature is a higher fraction of an option's value for firms where the underlying stock pays

high dividends or has high volatility. This may increase the attractiveness of reload options to some executives and some firms.

Appendix I.

Using the Binomial Option Pricing Model

The appendix illustrates the application of the Binomial Option Pricing Model to
the valuation of reload options.

The main steps are: (1) calculate the stock price tree, (2) value a conventional
option, (3) value the opportunity to reload the option one tinie by scaling the valnes

calculated in step (2), and (4) value the option with a reload feature by adding the value
of a reload option to the proceeds from exercise at each node.
For expositional convenience, we value an option to buy one share at an exercise

price of $10.00 with three years to expiration. The grant date stock price is $10.00, the

annual volatility is 30%, the firm pays no dividends, and N 3 periods. Thus, the up

factor is u = exp(.30 x 1) =

1.35,

the down factor is d = 1/1.35 =

neutral probability of an uptick is p

.741,

and the risk-

.54.

Calculate the Stock Price Tree
Table Al presents the array of possible stock prices for the 3 periods. The stock
price i periods before expiration given j net upticks since the grant date is S = $10.00 x

u. At node A, the current stock price, S, is $10.00 per share. Thus. stock price at
node B. S4, is $10.00 x 1.35 = $13.50 and at node C, Sf1, price is $10.00 x .741 = $7.41.
and so on.
21

Value a Conventional Option
Now assume that you have an option to purchase one share for $10.00 within the

next 3 time periods. The value q at a given node, described by the remaining time
to maturity. i, and the net number of upticks since the grant date, j, is determined

by computing the value at expiration, i =

0,

and then working backward to i =

1.

2. and so on. At each node, the holder has the choice of exercising or holding the

option. The value of exercising, V', is the greater of 0 and the difference between the

market price and the exercise price. Thus, at expiration node 0, the exercise value of

the option, V, is $24.60—$10,00 = $14.60 and at expiration node I, the exercise value of
the option, V', is $0.00 since exercising would result in a loss of $7.41 —$10.00 —$2.59.
The value of holding the option is determined by the expected payoff from holding

the option for one more period

- pC + (1 -p)CfI
1+r

where p = .54 is the probability of an uptick and r = 7% is the risk-free interest rate.

The calculations at node D in table Al are

=

.54 x $14.60 + .46 x $3.50

1.07

= $8.87,

?IJ1(l

%7X

= $18.23

—

$10.00

22

= $8.23.

Thus, C? =

$8.87

because Vh > V. Hence, it is optimal to hold rather than exercise

the option at node D. Exercise is worthwhile only at expiration nodes G and H. In the
absence of dividends, the value of exercising a coiiveritional option before expiration is

always less than the value of holding.

Value the Opportunity to Reload the Options
Now assume that the holder gets a reload grant of one share for each original option

when he exercises the option prior to expiration. Using the notation in the body of the
1 and in

japer, these assumptions correspond to Z

1.

The value of the reload

option at node D is the same as the value of a conventional option granted at node D
with an exercise price of $18.23 and 1 period to expiration. Table A2 shows the value

trees for the reload options issued at nodes D and B. The calculations for the holding
value of a reload option at node D (see panel 1) are

Vh =

.54

x $6.37 + .46 x $0.00
1.07

= $18.23 — $18.23

= $3.21.

0, and

= $3.21.
Since the holder receives one option for each option exercised, the value, Vi?, of the

reload option at node D is $3.21. If the holder received a fraction of a reload option for
each original option exercised, then the value of the reload would be that fraction times
the value of one reload option. The calculations are similar for the value of the reload
23

option issued at node B. Table A3 shows the valne of a reload option issned at each
node.

Value of the Option with a Reload Feature
To valne the original option with the reload featnre, the value of a reload option,
is added to the exercise valne of the original option for the same node, consistent

with equation (2). The value of the option at that node is still the maximum of the
holding value and the exercise value including the value of a reload option. One still

works backward from the value at expiration. Thus, the holding value of an option
with a reload feature differs from the holding valne of a conventional option because the
former depeuds on the value of reload options at snccessor nodes.

Table A4 presents the value of an option that may be reloaded once. The values
at expiration do not change from the value of a conventional option because both the

original and the reload options expire at i
option is now $8.23 + $3.21

0.

At node D, the exercise valne of the

$11.44. Thus, the value of exercising is greater than the

value of holding and the option value at node D is $11.44. TIns increases the holding
valne at node B from $5.24 to $6.53.

The value of the option with a reload feature is $3.68 at node A. The value of

the same option without a reload feature is $3.03 at node A. The difference is $65 or
a 21.5% increase in value due to the addition of a reload feature. Also note that the
addition of a reload feature leads to early exercise at node D whereas early exercise was

never optimal without the reload feature.

a Values are computed using the Binomial Option Pricing I\/lodel for grants of options

with varying restrictions on reloads, volatilities of the underlying stock, dividend
yields, and times to expiration. All options have strike prices eciual to the market
price on the grant date. Assumes one new option is granted on reload for each share
of stock surrendered in payment of the exercise price and an annual interest rate of
7%. Zero reloads correspond to conventional employee stock options. Values are as
at the grant date. and are expressed per dollar of stock price on the grant date. The
binomial trees used to produce these estimates have one step per month.

Assuming no dividends, volatility of 27.3%, an interest rate of 7%. strike and grant date
stock prices of $14.53, and the reload factor, Z, of Kovacevich's options, this figure plots
the optimal exercise region in a binomial tree for an option that may be reloaded once.
Optimally, exercise occurs when the stock price first passes into a node coded 'x'. In
regions coded '+', it is optimal to hold the option until the next period. Since it is not
optimal to exercise when the option is out of the money, stock prices below the strike
price are not plotted. The binomial trees used to produce these estimates have one SteJ)

This figure plots grant-date value in dollars of options with a strike price equal to the
grant-date stock price of $14.53 and a 10 year life as a function of the number of times
the option may be reloaded. The stock parameters are those of Norwest (i.e., a 3%
dividend yield and volatility of 27.3%). A 7% interest rate is assumed. The reload
factor, Z, corresponds to Kovacevich's options as described in the text. The horizontal
line in the figure is the value of options that may he reloaded an arbitrary number of
tiiiies. The binomial trees used to produce these estimates have one step per month.
