    "abstract": "\n\nWe build a model in which the Fed and the market disagree about future aggregate demand. The market anticipates monetary policy \u201cmistakes,\u201d which affect current demand and induce the Fed to partially accommodate the market\u2019s view. The Fed expects to implement its view gradually. Announcements that reveal an unexpected change in the Fed\u2019s belief provide a microfoundation for monetary policy shocks. Tantrum shocks arise when the market misinterprets the Fed\u2019s belief and overreacts to its announcement. Uncertainty about tantrums motivates further gradualism and communication. Finally, disagreements affect the market\u2019s expected inflation and induce a policy trade-off similar to \u201ccost-push\u201d shocks.\n\n",
