    "abstract": "\n\nUsing firm-to-firm transactions, we show that starting to supply a \u2018superstar\u2019 firm (large domestic firms, exporters and multinationals) boosts productivity by 8% in the medium-run. Placebos on starting relationships with smaller firms and novel identification strategies support a causal interpretation of \u201csuperstar spillovers\u201d. Consistent with a model of technology transfer, we find falls in markups and bigger treatment effects from technology-intensive superstars. We also show that the increase in new buyers is particularly strong within the superstar firm's network, a \u201cdating agency\u201d effect. This suggests an important role for raising productivity through superstars' supply chains regardless of their multinational status.\n\n",
