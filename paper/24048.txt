Fresh Air Eases Work – The Effect of Air Quality on Individual Investor Activity

ABSTRACT
This paper shows that air quality has a significantly negative effect on the likelihood of individual
investors to sit down, log in, and trade in their brokerage accounts controlling for investor-,
weather-, traffic-, and market-specific factors. In perspective, a one standard deviation increase in
fine particulate matter leads to the same reduction in the probability of logging in and trading as a
one standard deviation increase in sunshine. We document this effect for low levels of pollution
that are commonly found throughout the developed world. As individual investor trading can be a
proxy for everyday cognitively-demanding tasks such as office work, our findings suggest that
the negative effects of pollution on white-collar work productivity are much more severe than
previously thought. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a negative impact of
pollution on a measure of white-collar productivity at the individual level in a western country.

1. Introduction
This paper builds on an emerging economic literature that links air pollution to a wide
range of human impacts, including cognition, mood, and worker productivity (Graff Zivin
and Neidell, 2012; Chang et al., 2016; Lavy et al., 2014; He et al., 2016). We show that
individual investors are significantly less likely to sit down, log in, and trade in their
brokerage accounts when air quality is poor in a western economy with comparably high
air-quality standards. This effect appears economically large as it is comparable in
magnitude to the effects of weather, i.e., the incarceration effects due to precipitation or
the opposite because of sunshine. If we interpret individual investor trading, an indoor
activity that requires some skill and cognitive but no physical exertion, as a proxy for
willingness and ability to engage in office work and thereby white-collar productivity,
then the large significant negative effect we find implies that the detrimental impact of
pollution on workplace performance may be far more widespread than previously
believed.
Air quality measures such as particulate matter (PM) pollution easily penetrate indoors
(Thatcher and Layton, 1995; Vette et al., 2001) and feature considerable variation.
Exposure could affect work productivity through changes in cardiovascular and lung
functioning (Seaton et al., 1995), irritation of the ear, nose, throat, and lungs (Pope,
2000), as well as through direct impact on cognitive performance (Lavy et al., 2014).
After all, fine particulate matter translocate directly through the nose to the brain. 2
A handful of recent papers are closely related to our study. First, Chang et al. (2016)
show that pollution affects call-center work productivity, building on previous studies
showing that pollution affects productivity in physically arduous jobs (Graff Zivin and
Neidell, 2012; Chang et al., 2016; not confirmed on a daily level by He et al., 2016).
Second, Heyes et al. (2016) provide empirical evidence of a relationship between air
pollution and financial markets, linking short-term variations in fine particulate matter
in New York City to movements in the S&P 500. Furthermore, Lavy, Ebenstein, and
Roth (2014) show that air pollution is significantly negatively correlated with student
exam performance in Israeli high school exit exams and Archsmith, Heyes, and Saberian
(2016) find evidence that short-term exposure to air pollution is negatively associated
with the work performance of a sample of professional baseball umpires whose jobs are
brain-intensive and quality-focused. Additionally, Huang et al. (2016) analyze individual

2

Air pollutants such as fine particulate matter can translocate from the upper respiratory tract to the brain,
causing brain inflammation and cognitive deficits (e.g., Pope and Dockery, 2006; Block and CalderónGarcidueñas, 2009). Exposure to air pollutants can also reduce the capacity of red blood cells’ hemoglobin to
transport oxygen, leading to reduced availability of oxygen to the brain and impaired concentration and
confusion (Badman and Jaffe, 1996; Kampa and Castanas, 2008).

investors from 28 cities in China and find a negative relation between air pollution and
portfolio performance.
Relative to all these previous empirical studies, we analyze behavior and pollution at the
individual and much more disaggregated level. Beyond providing evidence at the
individual level, we look at a western economy, where the service and knowledge sectors
account for most of the economic output, but in which low levels of air pollution are not
commonly seen as a problem. This allows us to generalize our findings to all over Europe
and North America.
To investigate the effect of air quality on individual investors, we use a unique panel
dataset on the daily trading of 103,000 private investors in Germany spanning the years
2003 to 2015 matching their individual zip code location to the nearest of 1600 air,
weather, and traffic stations. We thus precisely measure each trader’s daily activity by
his log in and trading behavior and can interpret it as a measure of work productivity
(Bloom et al., 2014). Moreover, we use a fixed-effects approach to compare the same
individuals in the same place at the same time in the presence of different levels of air
quality.
The incremental contribution of this study, i.e., documenting a negative effect of
pollution on white-collar productivity, stands and falls with a substantial leap: treating
the willingness to log in and trade in brokerage accounts as a proxy for productivity.
Establishing an evidence-based connection between trading and productivity is very
difficult. In principle, it could be that individuals substitute away from trading and into
labor when air quality declines. However, we can rule out a negative connection and are
thus confident that work productivity and trading are positively linked for the following
reason: we can look at only tenured government workers or only retired individuals and
find the same effects. These two findings rule out the substitution channel and thereby
a negative link between work productivity and trading because government workers have
very stable hours and retired individuals do not work at all. Thus, we know that our
effects of air quality on individual investor activity is not driven by a decline in hours or
productivity.
Our findings are difficult to reconcile with competing hypotheses as we utilize variation
at the individual level and use a range of other time and meteorology controls to address
alternative explanations. For instance, air quality is correlated with sunshine or
precipitation which affects time spent on outside activities. To combat this concern, we
control for weather directly. Beyond weather, it could be that traffic—a major
contributor to pollution—can distort the results of the study. A nightmare commute
could reduce productivity by raising stress and causing late arrivals to home and less
2

willingness to sit down and trade. Again, we control for traffic directly at an even more
disaggregated level.
In Europe, emissions of many air pollutants have decreased substantially in recent
decades, resulting in improved air quality across the region. However, air pollutant
concentrations are still too high, and air quality problems persist. Germany of all
countries—seen internationally as a forerunner in environment protection—is not
innocuous in respect to air pollution. A historically strong faith in individual
transportation, unlimited speed highways, a powerful car industry, and widespread fossil
fuel combustion contribute to the ongoing pollution. The primary pollutant in Germany
is particulate matter. In 2014, Stuttgart, Germany exceeded the legal limit of fine
particulate matter concentrate on 64 days, more days per year than any other German
city. Like Stuttgart, other German cities such as Leipzig violate EU-wide standards (that
are less stringent than US ones) on a regular basis. Thus, we can exploit quite
considerable local variation to analyze how air quality affects willingness to sit down and
trade. Moreover, we are empowered to identify an effect even for cities with very low
levels of pollution in which individuals are not suffering any obvious symptoms.
The outcome variable of interest is whether individuals sit down, log in, and trade. Thus,
we estimate a linear probability model, which allows to interpret the coefficients
straightforwardly. We estimate that a one standard-deviation increase in the air quality
index reduces willingness to log in, or engage in other cognitively-demanding activities,
by 8.5 percent relative to what it would have been if the pollution levels were lower. To
put this number in perspective, a one standard deviation increase in sunshine has an
effect of approximately the same magnitude. Thus, the negative impacts of air quality
may well be larger than previously thought in high air-quality countries for high-skilled
occupations that form the backbone of the service and information economies.
Conditional on logging in, we find an additional effect of trading in the range of 1 percent;
again, in line with the effect of sunshine or precipitation. In a labor context, we thus find
large effects for both labor supply and the marginal product of labor.3 We also find large
effects on the internal margin when we look at the absolute value of trades and the
number of trades in unconditional regressions. Again, we find that a one standard
deviation increase in pollution induces the same reduction in the absolute value and
number of trades as a one standard deviation increase in sunshine. In purely conditional
regressions, the picture is somewhat less clear, for not only PM 10 but also sunshine.
However, we interpret this with caution as the conditional regressions suffer from obvious
selection bias, i.e., individuals who select into trading on a high-pollution day. This
3

One has to keep in mind that the effect on trade is on a sample of traders that logged in on a poor air pollution
day. Thus, the trade regression suffers from selection bias.

3

selection bias appears to considerably increase the coefficients for both PM 10 and
sunshine, which leads us to interpret them with caution.
Our data set stems from one of the largest retail brokerages in Germany. An advantage
of our data set is that we can exclude quasi-automatic trades that cannot be related to
air quality, such as savings plan transactions. Additionally, trading decisions in our
sample are not moderated by any influence from third parties, such as financial advisors.
Our sample includes only self-directed online investors. Moreover, we obtain data on
customer demographics such as gender, age, and occupation as well as detailed
information on traded securities such as asset class, risk class, issuer or issue date of a
security.
In line with Schmittmann et al. (2014), who analyze the effect of weather on trading
decisions of private investors, we use panel regressions with investor fixed effects and
follow their approach in defining the weather measures. Our primary air-quality variables
are particulate matter (PM) pollution and ozone. We can use either PM 10, that is,
particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter, or PM 2.5, that is, particulate
matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. Especially PM 2.5 is believed to have
detrimental cognitive effects. But because PM 2.5 is contained in our PM 10 data, the
two are highly correlated. Our main weather variables are sunshine and air pressure but
we can also include temperature, cloud cover (roughly the inverse of sunshine), and
precipitation. To avoid spurious correlation due to common seasonality in air quality,
weather, and trading measures, we demean the daily variables using the mean of the
closest calendar day (of the day-of-week for the pollution measures, or the annual average
for trading measures) under consideration over 10 years and control for month and year
fixed effects. Additionally, we control for various calendar and other effects that are
known to affect trading such as preceding market returns to control for momentum,
wealth, school and public holidays, closed-market days, turn of the month and year, day
of week, seasonal affective disorder, and changes of daylight saving time. The inclusion
of controls for weather, traffic, and various calendar effects provides a second safeguard
against spurious correlations and helps to differentiate between novel and already known
effects.
We further address two potential sources of omitted variables. The first one concerns
potential non-linearities in the impact of weather that happens to be correlated with
pollution. Therefore, instead of controlling for our four weather variables linearly, we
control for them in deciles but find the same results. The second one concerns local
productivity shocks. It could be that labor becomes more productive, workers work more,
and firms pollute more resulting in a negative correlation between investor activity and
pollution within individuals on a daily level within a month and year. To address this
4

concern, we can restrict the sample to tenured government workers but find the same
effects.
To further analyze the effects of air quality on the likelihood to sit down and trade and
assess the robustness of the baseline result, we split our sample in various ways. We first
partition our data by gender. We do not find that women are more affected by air
pollution but the effects are strongly significant and large in both subsamples.
Additionally, we split our sample by average pollution levels. We find that effects are
stronger in more polluted areas but again significant and large in both subsamples.
Finally, we split the sample by the trading frequency of individual investors and
sophistication, as measured by their average diversification. We find that effects are
larger for more frequent traders than for less frequent ones, while sophistication does not
make a big difference. We argue that these results lend additional credibility to our
extrapolation from willingness to trade to white-collar productivity.
Air quality’s potential influence on financial markets and investors can be relevant to the
existing literature in climate change, labor, and behavioral finance as an example of how
air pollution can influence productivity and market efficiency. Beyond the recent studies
in labor economics mentioned above, our paper is thus related and contributes to the
behavioral-finance literature studying how individual investor trading is influenced by
environmental conditions.
In this strand of literature, cognitive ability and sophistication have shown to influence
investment behavior and outcomes in Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2009a, 2009b) and
Seru, Shumway, and Stoffman (2010). Moreover, Korniotis and Kumar (2011) show that
older investors make worse trades, and Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainma (2012) find
that trades by high-IQ investors outperform those by low-IQ investors. Our study is also
related to the literature that analyses investor attention and sentiment. Barber and
Odean (2008) show that investors trade because a security has caught their attention by
news, because past day’s returns were large (Barber and Odean, 2008), Grinblatt and
Keloharju, 2001), because the weather is bad (Schmittmann et al., 2014) or because of
superstition (Bhattacharya et al., 2014). Da, Engelberg, and Gao (2011) and Da,
Engelberg, and Gao (2015) analyze Google search volume and Siganos, Vagenas-Nanos,
and Verwijmeren (2014) look at social media mood for Facebook as well as Bollen, Mao,
and Zeng (2011) for Twitter and find significant effects on trading volumes at the market
level. Kostopoulos and Meyer (2017) provide evidence that private investors also reduce
trading activity and tend to exit the market when sentiment is bad.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows: In section 2 we provide an overview of
our data set. Section 3 discusses our empirical approach. Section 4 presents the effects of
air quality on retail investors. Section 5 concludes.

2. Data
2.1. AIR QUALITY AND WEATHER DATA
We obtain hourly pollution data from all German air stations measuring ozone and fine
particulate matter (PM 10) and daily weather data from all German weather stations.
153 air stations and 197 weather stations are located across Germany and can be mapped
exactly to investors’ zip codes for controls in a given locale. The data on air pollution is
provided by the UBA (German Federal Environmental Agency) and the data on weather
is obtained from the German weather service (DWD).
[Insert Figure 1 about here]

Incorporated seasonality can be an important issue when considering our time-series data.
Seasonality effects could cause spurious correlations of our air quality measures and
applied trading measures. For example, ozone is generally more of a problem in the
summer. To avoid spurious correlations affecting our results, we include month fixed
effects in our panel regressions. Furthermore, we include year fixed effects to account for
potential spurious relationships in the data due to long-term trends in our time-series.
Finally, we demean the daily variables using the mean of the closest calendar day for
weather data or of the day-of-week for the pollution measures under consideration over
our sample period of 10 years.

2.2. TRAFFIC DATA
Traffic data is used as a control from BASt, a German research institute on federal
highways. Data are available from 2003 to 2015 and include hourly total traffic volume
of all vehicles passing through designated checkpoints in each direction. About 1300
checkpoints are located across Germany and can be mapped exactly to investors’ zip
codes for controls in a given locale. We also demean the traffic data using the mean of
the day-of-week for the traffic data.

2.3. INVESTOR DATA
In cooperation with a large German discount broker, we get information on a daily basis
regarding logins (from 2012 onwards), trades, and portfolio holdings of approximately
103,000 customers and match this data with our air quality, weather, and traffic data
from 2003 through 2015. One important characteristic of our investor data is that we are
able to identify self-directed customers. To ensure that we are looking at self-driven
behavior of investors, we exclude all customers who are not self-directed. Further, we
exclude transfers among personal accounts, saving plans and trades from limit orders4,
because this type of transactions do not reflect current trading decisions of investors.5
We keep only private investors that reside in Germany, as only these individuals’ trading
decisions can be influenced by German air quality. In online brokerages, silent attribution
is a common phenomenon, as usually there is no charge for having an account. Therefore,
in order to not analyze accounts of investors who stopped trading, we require that
households execute at least 1 trade per year. Table I highlights that these restrictions
leave us with a sample of 103,000 investors and a total number of trades of approximately
23 million.
[Insert Table I about here]

2.4. OUTCOME VARIABLES
We estimate a linear probability model for both logins and trades, i.e., the variable log
in is 1 if the investor logged in on a given day and 0 otherwise and the variable trade is
1 if the investor traded on a given day and 0 otherwise. This model allows us to interpret
the coefficients straightforwardly. Additionally, we use the number of trades and total
value of trades as alternative outcome variables.

2.5. CONTROL VARIABLES
Following Schmittmann et al. (2014) we include several control variables to our panel
regression of air quality on different trading variables in order to avoid picking up effects
that have already been found in previous studies.
The first group of controls consists of variables that generally explain trading patterns
of private investors. Preceding stock market returns may affect trading behavior of
households (Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin, 2001; Barber and Odean, 2008). In addition,
Garcia (2013) shows that investors react to news with a certain time lag. Both findings
4

See Linnainmaa (2010).
Saving plan transactions and trades from limit orders do represent trading decisions. However, these decisions
are made in the past or are influenced from other sources than the daily air quality, which we are analyzing.
5

7

lead to the conclusion that momentum could play a role in decision making of households.
Therefore, we include two momentum control variables on the right-hand side of our
regressions. First, a preceding-one-day realized market return variable and second a
preceding-three-month realized market return variable. Since our investor data cover
German retail investors (see Section 2.3) we use the CDAX. CDAX is a German
composite stock market index that captures all stocks tradeable on German’s Frankfurt
stock exchange.
Wealth plays a major role in decision making of households (Carroll, 2002; Wachter and
Yogo, 2010). For instance, Carroll (2002) generates evidence that risk aversion decreases
in wealth. To account for wealthy investor’s trading patterns and to not allow few huge
orders of wealthy investors to drive our results we control for wealth. We measure wealth
as the natural logarithm of the sum of all assets an investor holds at the end of the
preceding month.
Our second group of control variables is related to calendar-dates, such as public holidays.
Additionally, school holidays may have an impact on trading behavior of private
investors. In fact, Hong and Yu (2009) show that during school holidays, trading volume
is significantly lower. Therefore, we add a holiday dummy that varies across states, as
different states in Germany have different holiday periods. To control for abnormal trades
just before going on vacation or just after arriving from vacations, we insert two more
dummies – one for the last trading day before and one for the first trading day after
school holidays.6 Since public holidays could also have the same effect as school holidays,
we include one more dummy accounting for public holidays.
In the data we find investors to trade predominantly on German exchanges. It could be
that on days with no trading at the Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt, investors trade
significantly less. To control for this effect, we append a dummy for days with no trading
at the Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt.
Previous studies find anomalies on capital markets that are associated with the turn of
the month (Ariel, 1987; Lakonishok and Smidt, 1988) and the turn of the year (Rozeff
and Kinney, 1976; Reinganum, 1983; Jones, Pearce, and Wilson, 1987; Ritter, 1988;
Ritter and Chopra, 1989). Therefore, we add dummies for the first and last trading day
of the month and year. Likewise, French (1980), Lakonishok and Maberly (1990),
Gibbons and Hess (1981), Keim and Stambaugh (1984), Rogalski (1984) find anomalies
on Mondays and Fridays. Thus, we insert day-of-the-week dummies.

6

One may sell all risky positions just before going on vacation and rebuy risky positions right after returning from
vacations, because of limited access to accounts for instance.

8

Another well-known set of anomalies is related to human biorhythm (Kamstra, Kramer,
and Levi, 2000; Kamstra, Kramer, and Levi, 2003; Pinegar, 2002). Therefore, we control
for the seasonal affective disorder (SAD). We measure SAD as in Kamstra, Kramer, and
Levi (2003). Further, we include two dummy variables for Mondays following changes in
day light saving time – one for advancing clocks and one for adjusting them backwards.
Lastly, we incorporate year and month fixed effects. By doing so, we ensure that our
results are not driven by slow moving trends or single months-of-year, or any other slowmoving seasonality effects. In addition, month fixed effects control for tax-induced
trading behavior of retail investors (Rozeff and Kinney, 1976; Keim, 1983; Grinblatt and
Keloharju, 2001).

2.6. HYPOTHESES AND EMPIRICAL APPROACH
We develop three main hypotheses. Our first hypothesis is rather straightforward and
considers the external margin: when air quality is poor, individuals are less likely to
engage in a cognitively-demanding task such as trading unconditionally. With respect to
the internal margin, we hypothesize that, when air quality is poor, individuals trade less
in number and value. We define our three main hypotheses as follows:

Hypothesis 1 (H1): When air quality is poor, retail investors are less likely to log in.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): When air quality is poor, retail investors are less likely to trade.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): When air quality is poor, retail investors trade less in number and
value.
We test these hypotheses by performing investor fixed effects panel regressions that look
as follows:
1

TM(i,t) = α + β AQI(i,t)+ γ C(i,t) + ε(i,t)

(1)

TM represents the dummy for logging in and/or trading, the natural logarithm of
absolute number of trades, or the natural logarithm of absolute trade value. AQI are
ozone and fine particulate matter. C is the set of weather and traffic variables and the
set of control variables discussed in Section 2.5. i stands for an individual investor and t
stands for a certain trading day. The effect we are interested in is β. If our hypotheses
hold, β should have the expected sign and be statistically significant. We cluster standard
errors at the individual investor level or alternatively at the treatment level, i.e., the zip
code level. The latter increases standard errors marginally but all results remain highly
significant.
9

We perform regressions in the manner of Equation (1) in several ways. Moreover, we test
all three hypotheses for particular subsamples of our data. More precisely, we test
whether H1-H2 hold for male or female or both groups of investors and how effects differ.
Moreover, we differentiate between frequent and less frequent traders. We run all these
additional model specifications, because it sheds further light to the question how air
quality affects the behavior of individual investors on capital markets and because it
helps to check robustness of our main results.

3. Results

3.1. EFFECTS OF AIR QUALITY ON THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR
Table II shows effects on the unconditional probability to log in and trade.
[Insert Table II about here]
We find evidence that when air quality is poor, private investors are less likely to log in
and trade. We are able to comfortably reject the null hypothesis that the change in the
likelihood of logging in or trading equals to zero at less than the 1%-level for ozone and
less than the 1%-level for fine particulate matter, consistent with H1 and H2.
To facilitate the interpretation of the coefficients, we consider the percentage effect on
the unconditional means of logging in and trading of a one standard deviation increase
in ozone or PM 10 in Table III. For instance, when PM 10 increases by one standard
deviation, around 12 points, then the likelihood of logging in decreases by 0.37 percent
which is approximately 8.5 percent of the baseline probability of logging in on a given
day. Given that investors can trade only after logging in, the coefficient on trade is the
additional likelihood that investors do not trade at all conditional on having logged in.
In turn, the coefficient on trade implies that a one standard deviation increase in PM 10
makes investors 1 percent less likely to trade, conditional on logging in. Overall, investors
are thus 9.5 percent less likely to engage in trading on poor air quality days.
With respect to ozone, both effects are in the magnitude of 1 percent. This appears to
be in line with the evidence that ozone has less detrimental cognitive effects than PM
10. To put the coefficients on pollution in perspective, we also report the decrease in the
probability of logging in and trading from a one standard deviation increase in sunshine
and air pressure. Clearly, additional sunshine makes investors less likely to stay home
and trade in a country with mediocre weather and limited sunshine such as Germany. It
turns out, that the effect of a one standard deviation increase in sunshine is almost the
same in magnitude as PM 10 for both logins and trading. This underlines how important

10

and large the effects of air quality are on individual engagement in cognitively-demanding
tasks.
Beyond controlling for sunshine and air pressure, we can also include temperature and
precipitation. After all, we may be concerned that our pollution measures are picking up
residual variation from weather fluctuations. However, the inclusion of additional weather
variables strengthens the previous results if anything, as can be seen in Table IV. This
table presents coefficients and the magnitudes as described above. Again, pollution
appears to have a strong negative effect on logins and trading similar in magnitude to a
one standard deviation increase in temperature or decrease in precipitation.
[Insert Table III and Table IV about here]
Table IV also presents the results of our three most important robustness checks. First,
the table shows that results do not change when we cluster at the zip code level instead
of the individual level. Clustering at the zip code instead of the individual level is advised
given that our treatment, the effects of pollution, happens at the zip code level. Moreover,
the table addresses two important sources of omitted variables bias. First, it could be
that weather affects the likelihood to sit down and trade non-linearly and such nonlinearities happen to be picked up by the pollution measures. Therefore, we control for
sunshine and air pressure in ten deciles, which does not affect our results. Second, it
could be that the results are driven by high-frequency, local, productivity shocks, i.e., on
high-productivity days, workers work more (and have less time to trade), and firms
pollute more. To address this concern, we restrict the sample to tenured government
workers. We find the same coefficients for this subsample.
The restriction to tenured government workers also addresses a major concern with
respect to our treatment of the willingness to log in and trade in brokerage accounts as
a proxy for productivity. More specifically, finding the same effects for tenured
government workers rules out that individuals substitute away from trading and into
labor when air quality declines. Because government workers have very stable hours, we
know that our effect of air quality on trading cannot be driven by a decline in work
hours.
The larger coefficient on logins than trade suggests that pollution and weather affects
the external margin more so than the internal margin or labor supply more so than labor
productivity. To shed additional light on the internal margin, we run regressions using
the value and number of trades as the outcome variables instead of a dummy for logging
in or trading. Here, we can run unconditional regressions, i.e., including zeros for days
without any logins or trades, or conditional regressions, i.e., excluding zeros. It can be
seen in Table Va and Vb that pollution and sunshine reduce the value of trades and
11

number of trades significantly in the unconditional regressions. In terms of magnitudes,
the coefficient of sunshine and PM 10 are in line with the previous results and suggests
that a one standard deviation increase in sunshine reduces the value of trades by the
same amount as a one standard deviation increase in PM 10. This, again, suggests that
the detrimental effects of pollution are large and hypothesis H3 holds too.
[Insert Table Va and Table Vb about here]
When looking at the conditional regressions, excluding zeros, the picture is less clear. In
fact, in some instances, the coefficient flips for PM 10. We are not too concerned about
these results for three reasons. 1) the coefficients are very small statistically and
economically, 2) the signs flip for sunshine as well, and 3) the conditional regressions
suffer from obvious selection bias: they only include individuals who decide to log in and
trade on a high-pollution day. Clearly, the selection works in favor of increasing the
coefficients, which can be seen for both PM 10 and sunshine. We thus take the
unconditional regressions more seriously as they avoid this selection bias and yield the
same sign and magnitudes as the linear probability regressions.

3.2. EFFECTS OF AIR QUALITY ON SUBSAMPLES OF INVESTORS
In order to explore whether demographics play a crucial role for our results, we partition
our data in multiple different ways and rerun the analysis of Section 3.1 for each of the
formed subsamples. First, we partition by gender. It can be seen in Table VII that men
and women are both affected by air quality in a strongly significant way. Thus, our
effects are robust to partitioning by gender. Some medical research finds that women are
more affected by particulate matter. To reconcile our findings with this hypothesis, it
seems important to keep in mind that our sample of German women trading in discount
brokerage accounts is selective.
[Insert Table VII about here]
Beyond splitting the sample by gender, we can also split the sample by pollution levels.
We find that those traders living in relatively more polluted areas are more affected than
those living in less polluted areas. However, it is noticeable that the coefficients are highly
significant and of the same magnitude as the baseline in both sample splits, as can be
seen in Table IV.
[Insert Table VIII about here]
Beyond splitting the sample by gender and pollution levels, we can also split the sample
by trading frequency, which is of special interest given that we are trying to extrapolate
12

our findings to daily office work productivity. Heavy traders trade on more days than
the median number of days per year, 52. If heavy traders, who trade in a more
professional manner similar to office work, would be less affected, we would wonder
whether our findings are more relevant for leisure activities rather than labor. However,
we find that heavy traders are more affected than infrequent traders as can be seen in
Table IX.
[Insert Table IX about here]
Beyond trading frequency, we can also split the sample by investor sophistication, which
again may be informative about the extrapolation to daily office work productivity.
Sophisticated investors on average belong to the top 20% of best diversified investors at
the end of the month. We find that sophisticated investors are slightly less affected than
less sophisticated traders as can be seen in Table X. Overall, the difference is very small
relative to splitting by trading frequency for instance.7
[Insert Table X about here]
In summary, the coefficients from pollution are highly significant in all sample splits
and have a large impact on investor behavior that ranges around the same magnitudes
as changes in weather.

3.3. ADDITIONAL ROBUSTNESS CHECKS
In the previous section, we saw that the negative effects of pollution on investor’s
willingness to sit down, log in, and trade are robust and uniform in terms of coefficient
sizes throughout sample splits and the inclusion of additional weather controls.
Nevertheless, in the following we will address a number of other robustness concerns.
Pollution and weather monitors are subject to measurement error (Sullivan, 2016). In
principle, measurement error would bias our estimates towards zero. Nevertheless, to
address potential concerns we run a specification that only uses distance to air stations
of one kilometer. It is reassuring that the magnitudes of the coefficients are unchanged
for both logins and trades, though the significance of the trade coefficients is affected.
This is not too surprising as the number of observations considerably reduced though.
Moreover, for each zip code the longitude and latitude is the focal-point rather than the
most population-dense point and many individuals log in and trade during the day while

7

The average coefficient of both subsamples is lower than the coefficient in the main specification because we
dynamically split the sample into sophisticated versus unsophisticated traders in any given month rather than
performing a static split.

13

at the office. The size of each zip code area varies considerably depending on how remote
the area is. When we split the sample according to average levels of pollution, probably
a good proxy for rurality, we find smaller coefficients for low levels of pollution which
implies that the additional measurement error in larger zip code areas is dominated by
the main effect that pollution harms willingness to log in and trade. Nevertheless, all
coefficients are significant individually and exhibit similar magnitudes as in the main
specification.
[Insert Table X about here]
We notice that the coefficients on log in, for both weather and pollution, tend to be much
larger than the coefficients for trade. We first check whether this is driven by the fact
that logins are only available for a part of the sample period. However, when we run the
trade regression using the same sample period for which we have log in data available
we do not find a difference in the coefficients, neither in terms of the magnitude nor
significance even though the number of observations is greatly reduced, which is
reassuring. The results can be seen in Table XI.
[Insert Table XI about here]

4. Conclusion
We use individual investor trading as a measure of white-collar work productivity to
assess the effects of air quality on willingness to engage in a cognitively-demanding task.
We link highly disaggregated air, traffic, and weather data with daily trading records
and socio-demographic information of investors. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
is the first to test whether air quality affects investor willingness to sit down and trade,
controlling for investor-, environment-, and market-specific factors in a commonly-found
low-pollution environment. When air quality is poor, investors are significantly less likely
to log in and trade. The one-standard deviation effect on trading is similar in magnitude
to the effect of a one-standard deviation increase in sunshine and thus appears not only
statistically but also economically significant. We thus conclude that pollution may have
more harmful effects on white-collar productivity than previously thought.

This table presents results from investor fixed effects panel regressions on ozone and fine particulate matter for the
average investor. Uneven columns use the linear probability of at least one trade and even columns use the linear
probability of logging in as the dependent variable. All regressions control for a set of calendar-, weather-, traffic-, and
market-specific factors through the following variables: wealth, measured by the natural logarithm of preceding month’s
asset holdings; preceding-one-day realized market return (CDAX); preceding-three-month realized market return
(CDAX); seasonal affective disorder, measured as in Kamstra, Kramer, and Levi (2003); dummies for school vacations,
public holidays, trading days before school vacations, trading days after school vacations, trading days for closed
exchange, first trading days of the months, last trading days of the months, first trading days of the years, last trading
days of the years, day-of-week, Mondays following forward changes in daylight saving time, Mondays following
backward changes in daylight saving time, year and month fixed effects. We use White (1980) standard errors clustered
at the individual level that are robust to heteroskedasticity and report them in parentheses.

Table VIb. The impact of air quality on the number of trades
This table presents results from investor fixed effects panel regressions on ozone and fine particulate matter for the
average investor. Panel 1 uses the natural log of the absolute number of all trades, i.e., log(#buys+#sells), as the
dependent variable. All regressions control for a set of calendar-, weather-, traffic-, and market-specific factors through
the following variables: wealth, measured by the natural logarithm of preceding month’s asset holdings; preceding-oneday realized market return (CDAX); preceding-three-month realized market return (CDAX); seasonal affective
disorder, measured as in Kamstra, Kramer, and Levi (2003); dummies for school vacations, public holidays, trading
days before school vacations, trading days after school vacations, trading days for closed exchange, first trading days
of the months, last trading days of the months, first trading days of the years, last trading days of the years, day-ofweek, Mondays following forward changes in daylight saving time, Mondays following backward changes in daylight
saving time, year and month fixed effects. We use White (1980) standard errors clustered at the zip-code level that
are robust to heteroskedasticity and report them in parentheses.
