Marked point processes provide a theoretical framework for analysis of such data sets. The ACD model developed by Engle and Russell (1995) is then applied to IBM transactions data to develop semi-parametric hazard estimates and measures of instantaneous conditional variances.  The variances are negatively influenced by surprisingly long durations as suggested by some of the market micro-structure literature\n\n",
