    "abstract": "\n\nIn this paper we analyze the choice of diet for young children in low income families in the United States and its relation to the children's growth. Our most important finding is that the education and income levels in low income households are generally sufficient for the provision of adequate diets for children in the household. This conclusion is based on empirical results which show that low income parents have pushed the growth of their children through choice of diet nearly as much as possible, and which also show that mother's education and family income are insignificant determinants of the nutrient intakes of children in low income households.\n\n",
