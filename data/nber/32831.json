    "abstract": "\n\nOperation Warp Speed (OWS) was a U.S. government-led program to accelerate the development, production, and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The program cut the typical ten-year timeline needed to develop a new vaccine down to ten months and began vaccinating vulnerable populations within a year after launch. OWS\u2019s success has led to calls for a similar mission model to accelerate innovations addressing other pressing social needs, including a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease or atmospheric-carbon removal to combat global warming. We provide a framework to understand which innovations call for a mission approach and apply economic principles to identify key design features that contributed to the success of OWS.\n\n",
