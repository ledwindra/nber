The Role of Education:
Mobility Increasing or Mobility Impeding?

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the influence of education on labor and geographic

mobility. Mobility is an important equilibrating factor in a changing
economy. Therefore, any factor that induces mobility also alleviates the
symptoms of disequilibriun, and any factor that inhibits mobility also im-

pedes economic adjustments. Does the high level of education in modern industrial societies help or hurt economic transitions?

Economic theory provides conflicting arguments. On the one side, the
theory of firm-specific capital predicts that education increases job dura-

tion and therefore inhibits job mobility (Jovanovic, 1979). On the other
side, education should increase mobility in markets with imperfect information because better educated persons should be better able to collect and
process information, reducing search and transctions costs.

In a PSID subsample consisting of 736 individuals, we observed labor
and geographic mobility from 1968 to 1982 and related it to the level of

education at 1968. It appears that labor and geographic mobility are
governed by quite different behavioral mechanism. Education strongly affects future labor and geographic mobility, but in opposite ways. A high
level of education inhibits labor mobility, but increases geographic
mobility.

1. Introduction

This paper studies the influence of education on labor and geographic

mobility. Mobility is an important equilibrating factor in a changing
economy.1 Therefore, any factor that induces mobility also alleviates the
symptoms that accompany a state of disequilibrium in the economy, such as
the current high rate of unemployment in the United States and in Western

Europe. By the same token, any factor that inhibits mobility also impedes
economic adjustments. What role does the high level of education in modern
industrial societies play? Does it help or hurt economic transitions?
There are many notions of mobility. Labor mobility is understood to
include three kinds of job changes: job changes within the same industry
and occupation (such as promotions), the change from one occupation to
another occupation (occupational mobility), and the change from a job in
one industry to a new job in another industry (sectoral mobility).
Similarly, geographic mobility can be categorized into intraurban mobility,

moves between different communities within the same region, and
interregional migration.

Relative to other markets (for instance, financial markets), both the
labor market and the housing market are characterized by the overwhelming

importance of market frictions. As opposed to financial markets, imperfect
information, product heterogeneity, specific and immobile capital, and
idiosyncratic relationships in labor and housing markets imply very high
transactions costs and make adjustments of labor supply and housing

consumption very costly. Therefore, labor and housing markets tend to be
sluggish and exhibit long lasting deviations from market equilibrium. The
same factors and sometimes government intervention and other institutional

-2-

arrangements make for sticky wages and rents. Once in disequilibrium,
labor mobility is a crucial mechanisms to change the qualitative nature of
labor supply, i.e., the composition of skills available in the labor
market, just as geographic mobility is the almost exclusive mechanism by
which housing demand is changed.2

Labor and geographic mobility are closely tied together if not only by
the fact that the distribution of industries is historically distributed,
such that the decline of an industrial sector almost always implies the

decline of an entire geographic region. Typical examples are the
Pittsburgh region in the United States or the Ruhrgebiet in West Germany.
On the household level, commuting distance and neighborhood choice link

housing and job decisions within an urban area. Important job events such
as becoming unemployed for an extended duration may precipitate migration

with consequential housing adjustments. The reverse dependency may occur
when a household migrates because of local amenities such as climate and
the searches for a new job at the new place.3

Studying the determinants of labor and geographic mobility is
important because of the implications on labor market policies. The
current persistent unemployment in the United States and in Western Europe
(on an even more pronounced scale) is concentrated in certain industries

and occupations. In the short run, government subsidies may save jobs in
declining industries by creating demand or reducing cost.

However in the

long run, unemployment is likely to persist unless there is considerable

sectoral and occupational mobility. Long run economic policy must create
incentives to encourage labor mobility, the only mechanism of qualitative
change in labor market supply.

The very same argument holds for geographic mobility. As was argued
above, unemployment tends to be regionally distributed, and, unless firms

-3-

move to regions of high unemployment and unless new jobs are created and
also accepted by the existing labor force, regional unemployment is only

alleviated if workers migrate from depressed regions. On a smaller scale,
a new job may be found within a region, but only with a greatly increased

commuting distance. It therefore eventually force the worker to move into
a different neighborhood.

The lack of willingness to move and migrate in many European countries
is often considered an aggravating factor which contributes to the

persistence of unemployment in Western Europe. This is contrasted to the
more footloose American society where labor supply moved away from the
North East in the sixties and seventies and now returns back to the North

East during its current upswing. An interesting case study is Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. The recent impressive renaissance of Pittsburgh is the
consequence of a combination of outmigration (Pittsburgh lost one third of

her population from 1960 to l98O) and a drastic change of the industrial
base made possible by a degree of sectoral mobility that is unparalleled in
Europe (41.7 percent of all employees that worked in the primary metal

industry in 1972 had changed to a different industry in l982).
Modern industrial societies are characterized by a high level of

education and professional qualification. The central question of this
paper is whether education increases or impedes geographic and labor

mobility. Does the high level of general education and the still rising
level of professional skills in our society lock workers in specific tasks
at specific locations such that economic transitions are increasingly

painful? Or does it provide for better processing of information, hence
more flexibility that makes transitions easier in a changing economy?

Economic theory provides conflicting arguments. On the one side, the
theory of firm-specific capital predicts that education increases job

-4-

duration and therefore inhibits job mobility (Jovanovic, 1979). Directly
or indirectly, better education creates skills that may become increasingly
specific to a firm, an occupation, or an industry. The mor,e of such
specific skills are acquired, the more a worker becomes tied to a firm, an
occupation, or an industry.

On the other side, education should increase mobility in markets with

imperfect information. Educated persons should be better able to collect
and process information and are more efficient searchers, hence have lower
transactions costs, and may therefore move and change jobs more easily

(Greenwood, 1975). Also, educated workers should have an comparative
advantage with respect to learning and implementing new technologies

(Bartel and Lichtenberg, 1987). A common pattern among very highly
educated and experienced workers is to carry out innovative tasks
("missions") until the task becomes routine, somebody less qualified takes
over, and the highly qualified person takes on the next mission (Nelson and

Phelps, 1966). Finally, more educated workers are likely to have faster
careers and will change jobs more often as an institutional requirement to
step up on the career ladder.
Task of this paper is to let empirical evidence sort out which
mechanisms prevail - -

those

that make education induce mobility or those

that make education inhibit mobility. We will follow 783 American workers
from 1968 to 1982, recording all their moves and job changes in this 15

year time span. The sample is drawn from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics. We will relate the frequency of moves and job changes to several
measures of education, correcting for other determinants of labor and
geographic mobility such as demographic variables, income, and wealth.

The paper proceeds in four steps. First, we briefly describe the
econometric methodology. Second, we describe the data and collect the most

-5-

important stylized facts about education and mobility. Third, we present
Poisson regression results that indicate the role of education conditional

on demographic characteristics, income, and wealth. Finally, we interpret
these results in the light of economic theory and draw policy conclusions.

2. Econometric Methodology

A central methodological problem in empirical mobility analysis is the

handling of the time dimension. The most common procedure is to relate the
probability of moving, migrating, or changing jobs within a given time

interval to an array of explanatory variables.6 These studies fail to
account for repeat mobility and the sample selection problem introduced by

frequent and less frequent movers. Some studies employ continuous time
duration models that overcome these problems, however, their computational

effort is magnificent, particularly so, if the analysis describes more than

one state.7
The primary question of this paper is whether a person with a given

level of education is more or less likely to move, to migrate, or to change

jobs in the future. Therefore, the appropriate experiment is to collect a
cross-section of persons with different levels of education at a given time
and then observe their mobility behavior as life continues, holding all

other characteristics constant. We then ask ourselves, how the number of
moves or job changes in their life times is related to their initial levels

of education. This view of mobility is quite different from those models
of mobility that compare the economic benefits and costs of a specific move

or job change. For the question at hand, we are not interested in the
returns from making such a change per Se. We also abstract from the choice
of geographic destination or target job, the "pull-factors" (Greenwood,

-6-

1975). Rather, our goal is a predictive model that discriminates among
more or less mobile individuals by their level of education and other

characteristics. The Poisson regression technique is a well-suited model
to do so.

The probability of the number of moves (job changes, etc.) made by an
individual can approximately be described by a Poisson distribution:

Prob(individual moves k times)

exp(-A) • Ak /

k!

(1)

where the parameter A denotes the expected number of moves.8 The expected

number of moves will not be a constant across individuals. This is the
place to test our hypothesis: does this expected number vary by the level
of education as well as by other demographic and economic attributes of

individuals? We postulate that the expected number of moves (job changes,
etc.) by individual n can be expressed as9

K
An =

(2)

E knk )

exp(

k=1

where xnk denotes attribute k of individual n. These attributes include
basic demographics, income, wealth, and various measures of education which

will be specified in more detail in Section 3. The parameters k measure
the relative effects of attributes Xnk on the expected number of moves.

They will be estimated by maximum likelihood. The corresponding
loglikelihood function is

The likelihood function (3) is concave and can quickly be maximized by

Newton-Raphson iteration. Its inverse second derivatives yield the
standard errors of the coefficients

3. Data Description and Basic Statistics

The 1982 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) includes about 3600
families that represent a random sample of the United States population in

1982.11 For each family, data is available on a yearly basis from 1968 to
1982. Among all families, we selected those in which the head stayed the
same and was in the labor force throughout the entire period from 1968 to

1982.12 The resulting sample of household heads includes 736 individuals.
Because of the relatively long duration of the panel

-

- 15

years - -

these data provide a unique basis for an empirical analysis of the
questions posed above. These data help to alleviate a common problem in
empirical mobility analysis, namely, that job or geographic mobility is a

relatively rare event. The data record all job and locational changes from
1968 to 1982, old and new occupation and industry in case of a job change,
and old and new county and distance to city center in case of a geographic
move.

We consider nine different variables that indicate the various aspects

of mobility. In order to measure labor mobility, we count the number of
job changes (NJOB), the number of changes of occupation (NOCCUP) and the

number of changes of industry (NINDUS))-3 Geographic mobility is measured
by the number of intercounty moves (NCOUNTY), the number of intercity moves
(NCITIES), and the number of interstate moves (NSTATES).14 Finally, we
count the number of times in which an individual changed city and job

during the same 12-month period (NCITJOB). Similarly, we counted the

-8-

number of combined city and occupation changes (NCITOCC) and of combined
city and industry changes

(NCITIND))5 Table A-i in the Appendix lists the

observed numbers of events indicating considerable geographic and labor
mobility in the United States.

A wide array of demographic and economic characteristics of the family
are reported in the PSID which will serve as explanatory variables. Table
A-2 displays the most important background variables and their relation to

mobility. Mobility is highest among male, white, young individuals with
low income and no children. It decreases sharply with age and number of
children.

In addition, several measures of education and professional
qualification are recorded for each family member. They will be used as
indicator variables and for the construction of a simple index of
education:

We also record previous work experience and the score of a simple IQ-test.

Table 1 cross-tabulates the nine different mobility measures by level

of education. Clearly, the level of education has quite different
implications on the different kinds of mobility: education appears to
substantially impede labor mobility, but it appears to increase geographic

mobility and - -

to

a lesser extent - -

combined mobility.

4. Poisson Regression Results

The entries in Table 1 must be interpreted with care because they are

confounded by other demographic and economic attributes. Education is
highly positively correlated with income and wealth, and negatively

correlated with age, household size, and minority status. Table 1 may
indicate these factors rather than a direct effect of education. To
separate the direct effect of education from the indirect effect through

other demographic and economic attributes, we applythe Poisson regression
model delineated in Section 2 to the nine dependent variables introduced in

the preceding section. Full regression results are reported in the
Appendix, Tables A-3 and A-4. Table 2 summarizes the effect that the index
of education (Section 3) has on mobility.

Two

conclusions

emerge from Table 2. Even after correcting for other

demographic and economic factors, a high level of education emerges as a

substantial deterrent to labor mobility. On the other hand, more education
appears to increase geographic mobility and combined mobility.

These conclusions from Table 2 are confirmed by a more careful

analysis in which the simple index of education is replaced by a set of
dummy variables that indicate which level of education has been achieved.

-11-

The detailed results now quite clearly establish the patterns already

detected in Tables 1 and 2. Labor mobility and geographic mobility are
affected by education in exactly the opposite way. Individuals with a high
level of education are less likely to change jobs but are more inclined to

move geographically. These opposing effects are particularly pronounced
among academically trained individuals but also precisely measurable among
the large number of individuals with completed high school and no
additional education.

Table 4 translates the regression coefficients of Table 3 into the

expected number of job changes, moves, and combined changes. The entries
are computed by evaluating equation (2) using the estimated coefficients of
Table A-4 and the means of all background variables.

Note: Predictions based on Poisson regression results, Appendix, Table A-4.
Other attributes of individuals are evaluated at their sample means.

A higher level of education virtually always strongly reduces labor

mobility. The effect of education on the expected number of changes is
quite large: 50 percent more job changes and 2 to 2.5 times as many

occupation and industry changes are predicted for the highest as compared

to the lowest level of education. Note that in comparison to the simple

-12-

cross-tabulation in Table 1, these predicted differences are smaller
because of the confounding effects in Table 1 of other variables that are
correlated with education and have their own effect on mobility.

Therefore, the magnitudes of the pure effects of education on labor
mobility are particularly impressive.

The reverse relation between education and mobility is true for
geographic mobility, although the picture is a little more complicated.

Very high levels of education (college or university degrees) substantially
increase the likelihood of migration, but there is also an above average
willingness to move among those individuals that a high school education

completed after ninth to eleventh grade. Geographic mobility is lowest
among individuals with very little education (eight or less high school

grades) or an aborted college education. As was the case in labor
mobility, the differences in geographic mobility among education levels are
very pronounced: an individual with college education is predicted to move
roughly three times as often than a person with high school education
aborted at or before the eighth grade.

What is the interpretation of these results? How do they relate to
economic theory? The labor mobility impeding role of education is
consistent with the theory of firm-specific capital. A worker is more
likely to accumulate skills and knowledge that are specific to a firm, a

job, or an industry if he or she has a high level of education. Note that
this effect is measured net of age and work experience -

- it

is solely the

effect of education at the beginning of the observation period in 1968.

Not surprisingly in light of the theory of firm-specific capital, work

experience itself has a mobility deterring effect. If statistically
significant, its effect is strongly negative (second to last row in Table
3, labelled WORKEXP).

-13-

The geographic mobility increasing role of very high levels of
education is consistent with the theory of search and transactions costs
that decrease with a higher level of education because more educated
individuals are likely to accumulate more information and process

information more efficiently. Note that this effect is measured net of
other demographic factors and income that may affect transactions costs.
Intellectual ability, though quite coarsely measured by the score of a
simple sentence completion word test, appears to increase mobility in most

cases (last row in Table 3, labelled IQSCORE))6
Is there a contradiction? After all, most geographic mobility occurs
in conjunction with labor mobility. The apparent contradiction is resolved
by looking at the absolute frequency of changes, Table 3.

Job changes

occur substantially more often than geographical moves. Except for
transfers, geographic moves are indeed combined with a change of job.

However, most job changes take place without geographic mobility. We
conclude that job changes, including change of occupation or even industry,
need to overcome on average a lower threshold of transactions costs than

geographic changes. This lower threshold is higher for educated
individuals as compared to individuals with lower levels of education

because they accumulated more firm-specific capital; However, an even
higher threshold has to be overcome for geographic mobility. This second
threshold now varies inversely with education. Once job ties are severed,
distance of move is a matter of information, courage, and the willingness
to accept a new environment - -

properties

which are positively correlated

with a high level of education.

Added evidence for this two-threshold explanation comes from the

horizontal pattern of coefficients in Table 3. First, education matters
more for larger geographic distance. In most education categories, the

-14-

coefficients are largest for interstate and smallest for intercounty

mobility.17 This pattern in geographical mobility confirms the role of
geographic distance in transactions costs. Second, industry changes --

which are presumably the most incisive labor market change - -

exhibit

much

smaller negative (if not positive) coefficients than occupation or general

job changes. This appears to indicate that the higher the threshold is
that has to be overcome to precipitate a move or a job change, the more
important is the role of information processing and other factors that
correlate positively with education.
Finally, it follows that combined labor and geographic mobility,

characterized by a very high threshold, should be affected positively by

education and intellectual qualification. The three left-most columns of
Table 3 confirm this conclusion, though with little precision due to the
relatively infrequent occurrence of such changes.

5. Summary and Conclusions

In a sample consisting of 736 individuals, we observed labor and
geographic mobility from 1968 to 1982 and related it to the level of

education at 1968. Education affects future labor and geographic mobility
in opposite ways. A high level of education inhibits labor mobility, but
increases geographic mobility. The empirical results confirm the theory of
firm-specific capital in labor relations (better education implies more
specific skills which in turn imply longer job durations), but the role of

informational transactions costs in geographic mobility (better education
provides for more information which lowers psychic and monetary

transactions costs). The opposing effects of a high level of education are
only an apparent contradiction because labor mobility as a much more

-15-

frequent event may very well be governed by different behavioral mechanisms
than the relatively infrequent event of a geographic move.

The results suggest that it is not easy to design a policy that
relieves regional unemployment through increased mobility induced by better

education. Geographic mobility will be encouraged by a very high level of
general education. However, there appears to be a well pronounced trough
in geographic mobility for persons with a medium level of education.

Moreover, increasing the general level of education will decrease labor

mobility. In order to encourage labor mobility away from declining
industries and occupations, it appears that specific training rather than
just general education is required --

training

that teaches those new

skills that are associated with stable or rising industries and
occupations.

other applications, the data exhibits more variation than implicit in the
Poisson assumption.
Linearity is chosen for simplicity. The exponentiation ensures a
nonnegative number of events.
10 See Maddala (1983) for a description of the Poisson regression model
and some applications.
The PSID includes an additional 2400 mostly low income families sampled
non-randomly.
12 In addition, a few observations were excluded because of missing data.
There is a potential sample selection problem because the frequency of a
head change may be correlated with he frequency of job and residency
changes. In addition, sample truncation occurs because the 15 year
interval is long, but less than an adults active work life. Both biases
lead to an underestimation of actual mobility.
l3 Job changes include change of employer as well as change of position.
Depending on year of survey, occupation and industry are identified by a
PSID-specific 1-, 2-, or 3-digit code, roughly comparable to the SIC code.
An occupation or industry change is recorded whenever the first digit
changed. The data quality of labor mobility, industry and occupation is
not completely satisfactory. In particular, some occupation changes are
not reported as job changes.
l4 The sequence of mobility variables is strictly increasing in geographic
distance. Intercity moves are moves that cross a county border (if rural)
or a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) border (if urban).
SMSAs are represented by the counties they are part of according to the
1982 City and County Data Book.
l5 The combined mobility measures suffer from the imprecision with which
dates of job and residency changes are reported.
16• See the 1972 PSID variable descriptions.
l7 The reader may be reminded that these coefficients measure the effect
of these education levels vis-a-vis individuals with incomplete high
school.
