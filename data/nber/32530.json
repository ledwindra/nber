    "abstract": "\n\nInstitutional investors conduct more governance research and are less likely to follow proxy advisor vote recommendations when a company\u2019s bonds comprise a larger share of their assets. These findings are driven by bond holdings, shareholder proposals, and companies where fixed-income managers are more likely to be attentive and share an interest with equity investors in improving governance. The findings do not concentrate on companies or shareholder proposals where creditor-shareholder conflicts are likely. Overall, the findings suggest that corporate bond holdings influence how actively institutions monitor their equity positions and contribute to institutions\u2019 overall incentive to be engaged stewards.\n\n",
