ABSTRACT
We use standardized end-of-course knowledge assessments to examine student learning during
the disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining seven economics courses taught
at four US R1 institutions, we find that students performed substantially worse, on average, in
Spring 2020 when compared to Spring or Fall 2019. We find no evidence that the effect was
driven by specific demographic groups. However, our results suggest that teaching methods that
encourage active engagement, such as the use of small group activities and projects, played an
important role in mitigating this negative effect. Our results point to methods for more effective
online teaching as the pandemic continues.

When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the United States in the spring of 2020, most
colleges and universities switched from in-person teaching to remote instruction. As the
pandemic continues to unfold, even those institutions that brought students back to campus in the
Fall 2020 term have had to offer substantial numbers of courses online. For many institutions,
this transition to online learning was conducted on short notice, with little planning or prior
experience to guide the transitions. For educational institutions to be successful in providing
students with the best possible learning experience in this new environment, it is essential to
understand which aspects of pedagogy proved to be most effective and whether specific groups
of students were more vulnerable in the forced switch to remote instruction, so that they can be
provided with additional support.
Investigating how different aspects of teaching affect the learning of different types of
students is often challenging. Typically, our best measure of learning in a course is the final
exam, and these exams can differ in difficulty or not evaluate the same course learning goals
from semester to semester. In the pandemic, these challenges are further complicated by changes
in the way final exams are often administered (e.g., going from a closed book proctored exam
taken on campus to an open book unproctored exam taken online in a student’s home). We
circumvent this issue by analyzing data from seven intermediate-level economics courses in
which student learning was measured using standard multiple-choice assessments developed at
Cornell University as a part of the Active Learning Initiative (1), following the procedure
outlined in (2): the Intermediate Economics Skills Assessment – Microeconomics (IESA-Micro,
31 questions), the Economic Statistics Skills Assessment (ESSA, 20 questions), the Applied
Econometrics Skills Assessment (AESA, 24 questions), and the Theory-based Econometrics
Skills Assessment (TESA, 21 questions). Each of the assessment questions are mapped to
explicit course learning goals, and assessments were administered as low-stakes tests just prior to
or just after the final class meeting of each semester.
In this paper, we compare student performance on standard assessments in Spring 2020 to
student performance in the same courses in either Fall or Spring 2019 to estimate the impact of
the emergency switch to remote instruction induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using these
data, we address three questions: First, we examine how end-of-semester knowledge was
influenced by the measures taken in Spring 2020. Second, we assess whether certain groups of

students were more affected by the pandemic. 1 And third, we look at whether the use of specific
teaching methods resulted in a more successful transition to remote teaching.
Our data were collected during the Spring 2019, Fall 2019, and Spring 2020 semesters at
four R1 PhD-granting institutions. Student data include the performance on the multiple-choice
assessments and responses to a demographic questionnaire. At the end of the Spring 2020
semester, instructors of the seven courses filled out a survey regarding their teaching practices
before and during the pandemic and the extent of material coverage during the pandemic
semester. All but one of the seven courses were taught by the same instructor in the prepandemic and pandemic semesters. Since each of the assessment questions is mapped to one or
more course-specific learning goals, we were able to calculate a separate subscore for the
material that was taught remotely during the latter portion of the semester. Our analysis sample
pools the students who completed the study courses with two sets of restrictions imposed: First,
students must have answered survey questions on gender, ethnicity, parental education, and nonnative English speaker status. Response rates varied somewhat across courses, but based on
administrative data, it does not look like changes in rates across semesters in the same courses
were correlated with student characteristics such as GPA. Second, for students who took the
assessments online, we analyze only those respondents who demonstrated some effort by
spending at least five minutes on the test.
Table 1 shows the proportions of students who are female, underrepresented minority
(URM), first-generation collegegoers, and who are non-native English speakers in both the prepandemic (Spring or Fall 2019) and pandemic (Spring 2020) semesters. We cannot reject the
hypotheses that these proportions are statistically equal between the pandemic and pre-pandemic
semesters, except for finding a lower proportion of the first-generation students in the pandemic
semester. It is possible that these students were more likely to withdraw from courses or college
all together during the term. Any differences in these measures are addressed in our analyses
through the inclusion of these demographic characteristics as controls in our models. We
normalize the assessment scores by the mean and standard deviation of the pre-pandemic

This question is partially motivated by prior findings that African American students and those with lower grade
point averages perform worse in online classes than in-person classes (3).

semester for each course. This allows us to pool the data from several courses and interpret effect
sizes in terms of pre-pandemic standard deviations (SD).
Our survey of instructors asked about previous experience teaching online and whether
they used particular teaching methods during the pandemic semester. Six of the seven classes
were taught synchronously during the remote instruction period with lectures delivered to
students in a Zoom meeting room. The seventh instructor pre-recorded lectures and spent the
scheduled class time in Zoom answering student questions about the material.
In our analysis, we focus on two easily measured aspects of active learning pedagogy:
use of polling software or “clickers” and explicit incorporation of peer interaction in the virtual
classroom. Asking students to answer conceptual questions or solve problems during class has
been shown to improve outcomes in in-person classes [e.g., (4, 5)] because it forces students to
engage with the material and gives the instructor immediate feedback on what students have
learned. We coded a course as using polling if the instructor polled students with at least two
questions in all or all but one or two class meetings. Having students work together to answer
challenging questions and engage in “peer instruction” has also been associated with positive
student outcomes [e.g., (6, 7)]. We considered a course as using peer instruction if the instructor
used at least two of the following strategies during the online portion of the pandemic semester:
1) classroom think-pair-share activities, 2) classroom small group activities, 3) encouraging
students to work together outside class in pre-assigned small groups, and 4) allowing students to
work together on exams. Our goal was to see whether online teaching experience or these two
teaching techniques could potentially mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic in some
courses.
We estimate three linear regression models for each of our two dependent variables: the
standardized overall score on all assessment questions and the subscore based on the material
that was taught remotely in the second portion of the Spring 2020 semester. Our first model
estimates the effects of the pandemic separately for each of our seven study courses by including
a course-specific fixed effect (𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ) and separate course-specific effect for the pandemic semester

(𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ):

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

The subscript i denotes the course, p is 1 during the pre-pandemic semester and 2 during
the pandemic semester, and s indexes the student. The relative difference in average outcomes
(pre-pandemic vs. pandemic) for each course is represented by the 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 term.

Our second model introduces a vector of controls for student demographic characteristics

(𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and interacts them with an indicator variable for the pandemic (𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 ):
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝜙𝜙𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

𝛽𝛽1 represents the average effects of the demographic characteristics in the pre-pandemic

semester while 𝛽𝛽2 denotes the relative difference in these effects during pandemic semester.
We define our third model by replacing the course-specific pandemic effects with a

single pandemic indicator variable (𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 ) and interactions of that variable with a vector of three
terms representing instructor and teaching characteristics (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 ):

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 + 𝛼𝛼2 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 × 𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

The three characteristics we include are whether the instructor has online teaching
experience, whether the course included structured peer interaction in the classroom (e.g.,
working through problems in small groups), and whether the instructor used the common active
learning technique of asking students to answer questions during class using polling software. In
this model, 𝛼𝛼1 is the average effect of the pandemic holding the instructor and teaching

characteristics at zero, and 𝛼𝛼2 is the average effect of each of these characteristics on learning
during the pandemic semester relative to the non-pandemic semester.

We use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to obtain consistent point estimates of
coefficients, but because the standard assumption of independence of error terms is violated in
our context, we must use care in estimating our standard errors. Specifically, the unobservable
shocks (𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) are likely to be positively correlated for students in the same course. The

conventional approach in this case is to calculate the cluster-robust standard errors, with each
course serving as a cluster, but this method has been shown to perform poorly when the data
contains a small (e.g., less than 30) number of clusters. Instead, we use the wild bootstrap
method proposed in (8) to assess the statistical significance of estimated model coefficients
because it allows us to conduct unbiased hypothesis tests even with a small number of clusters.

We standardize the assessment scores for each course using the pre-pandemic semester
yielding the means of zero for the overall score and remote subscore shown in the first column of
Table 1. In the pandemic semester, the overall score drops by 0.185 SD (p=0.015) while the
remote subscore drops by 0.096 SD (p=0.181). This smaller and less precisely estimated effect is
not altogether surprising, since these scores measure learning of topics taught closer to the
administration of assessments, which potentially would be fresher in students’ memory.
Furthermore, at the institutions in this study, there was an extended break (up to three weeks)
before the remote portion of the semester started. On the whole, these results suggest that
student outcomes did suffer in the pandemic semester and the magnitudes of the declines in
learning were not trivial.
The first two columns of Table 2 show that the effects of the pandemic on learning were
very heterogeneous across courses. To illustrate, students in one course experienced a 0.836 SD
decline in average overall scores, while students in another saw scores increase by 0.190 SD. All
of these estimates differ significantly from zero (p-values shown in parentheses), and effects on
the remote subscores are similarly varied.
In columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, we add controls for demographic characteristics in the
models. This addition changes some of our course-specific estimates of the pandemic effect, but
they remain very heterogenous and precisely estimated. The coefficients on the un-interacted
demographic characteristics represent differences in learning in the pre-pandemic semester. They
are mostly negative, replicating a common finding that female students and under-represented
minorities (URM) often perform at lower levels than male or non-URM students in STEM
courses [e.g., (9,10)]. We find that students who learned English as a second language (ESL)
performed significantly worse than native English speakers on the material that was taught in the
second portion of the course. Despite these direct effects, we see little evidence of interaction
effects illustrating specific problems among these groups during the pandemic semester.
Examining the interaction effects in the bottom rows of the table, we find very small and
insignificant differences in performance in the pandemic semester for female and URM students
relative to the pre-pandemic semester, and imprecise estimates of these differences for first
generation and ESL status. Taken together, we see little evidence that students in different
demographic groups were differentially affected by the pandemic.

Moving from course-specific to aggregate analysis, we estimate models in Table 3 that
include a main effect for the pandemic semester, course-level fixed effects, demographic
characteristics and variables representing each instructor’s teaching experience and the teaching
methods they used during the pandemic interacted with the pandemic indicator. Holding the
demographic and instructor-level variables at zero, the pandemic and the emergency switch to
remote instruction had a negative impact on student learning, especially for material that was
taught during the remote portion of the semester where we see a statistically significant drop of
0.765 SD. That is, when instructors had no experience teaching online and did not include peer
interaction or student polling when they taught remotely, our model predicts substantially lower
scores in the pandemic semester relative to the pre-pandemic semester.
Consistent with results shown in Table 2, none of our demographic groups experienced
significantly different effects of the pandemic relative to white or Asian male students that had at
least one parent with a college degree and spoke English as their native language.
We find evidence that instructor experience and course pedagogy played important roles
in ameliorating the potentially negative effects of the pandemic on learning. When the instructor
had prior online teaching experience, student scores were significantly higher overall (0.611 SD,
p=0.074) and for the remote material (0.625 SD, p=0.000). Students in classes with planned
student peer interactions earned scores that were similar relative to students in other classes on
the overall scores and 0.315 SD higher (p = 0.040) for the material taught remotely. We find no
separate significant effect of polling students during class on student outcomes in the pandemic.
Our findings make us optimistic about future student learning outcomes even though we
remain in a period of substantial online instruction. First, online teaching experience seems to
matter, and during Spring 2020 most college faculty accumulated substantial experience. Second,
we expected that disadvantaged groups would be further disadvantaged during the pandemic
given their relative lack of support at home, but we found no statistical evidence of this concern.
Third, we have shown that it is possible to incorporate peer interaction such as think-pair-share
(6) or small group activities (11) into synchronous online courses, and that it was significantly
associated with improved learning during the remotely taught portion of the semester.
