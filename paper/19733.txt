Economic Transition and Private-Sector Labor Demand: Evidence from Urban China

ABSTRACT
This paper studies the policy determinants of economic transition and estimates the demand for labor
in the infant private sector in urban China. We show that a reform that untied access to housing in
urban areas from working for the state sector accounts for more than a quarter of the overall increase
in labor supply to the private sector during 1986-2005. Using the reform to instrument for private-sector
labor supply, we find that private-sector labor demand is very elastic. We provide suggestive evidence
that the reform equalized wages across sectors and reduced private-sector rents.

1 Introduction
One of the key economic and historic events of the late 20th Century is the transition
of centrally planned socialist economies to market economies.

According to the

International Monetary Fund, 36 countries have experienced economic transition,
aecting over 40% of the world's population, only ten of which have completed the
process (Barnett et al., 2000). An essential component of economic transition is the
movement of labor from state employment to private employment. This has featured
prominently in the IMF's policy recommendations to Eastern European transition
economies during the early 1990s (Mitra et al., 2002) and in the highly proled

2030

report by the World Bank and the Chinese State Council (World Bank, 2012,

p. 88).
While improving labor allocation could be benecial in the long run, policy makers must also consider the costs of such policies in the short-to-medium term.

If

short-to-medium run labor demand elasticity in the private sector is low, then large
and sudden increases in labor supply to the private sector can result in signicant
wage and income reductions, or even job losses for workers. This can, in turn, lead
to political and social instability. Thus, understanding the policies that governments
of transitioning economies can employ to gradually reallocate state-sector workers
to the private sector and the ability of an infant private sector to absorb labor are
rst order concerns for policy makers today.
The goal of our paper is to make progress on these questions with novel and rigorous empirical evidence in the context of urban China. First, we provide evidence
that reducing employer-provided benets increased private-sector labor supply. In
our case, we study the untying of access to urban housing from state-sector employment.

Second, we use the urban housing reforms to instrument for private-sector

labor supply and estimate the labor demand elasticiticity in the urban private sector.

The Chinese context oers several advantages for understanding the mechanisms
underlying economic transition. In contrast to Eastern Europe, the Chinese transition process took place under political and macroeconomic stability, and there was
considerable variation in the timing of economic reforms across Chinese provinces

and cities, which enables econometric identication.

tion across cities in China enables us to treat each city's labor market as relatively
isolated. Though there was no comprehensive rm-level survey in the early transition
years, we are able to use China's

Urban Household Income and Expenditure Surveys

(UHIES) to measure employment status, housing ownership and wages. These data
are of high quality. Private enterprises in this household survey are businesses started
by individual entrepreneurs and are distinct from privatized state rms.
Our study proceeds in several steps. First, we construct a unique dataset on citylevel reform dates using information from province-level newspapers in the National
Library archives in Beijing.

Our main variable of interest is the date of the rst

reform which untied access to housing from state-sector employment.

to ten years later, a second reform allowed residents to trade (sell, buy, lease) this
newly acquired housing. We also collected information on the dates of the second
reform to ensure that our results are not driven by the possibility of monetizing the
housing. We combine the data on reform dates with UHIES household survey data
for a panel of 27 cities over 1986-2005.
The reforms were introduced at dierent times across cities. According to conventional wisdom, the timing of the reforms was mostly determined by the needs
of budget-constrained city governments to devolve their responsibility for providing
worker housing.

1 Other

Consistent with this, we nd that cities with lower government

studies which exploit such variation across provinces include Lin (1992), who examines

the impact of the Household Responsibility System.

2 These

reforms have been enacted in at least 50 Chinese cities, aecting more than 90 million

people, making it the largest urban property reform in history.

revenues in the early 1980s are likely to introduce housing reform earlier. Using a

dierence-in-dierences

approach, we compare labor market choices of households

before and after the introduction of the housing reform, between cities that have
already introduced it to those that have not.

Our estimates control for city xed

eects, which control for all time-invariant dierences across cities, and year xed
eects, which control for all changes over time that aect cities similarly, such as
macroeconomic changes or introduction of national policies (including the national
law on urban housing reform enacted in 1994). Since the timing of the reform was
determined in part by city government revenues, we also control for pre-reform city
government revenues interacted with year xed eects.
Second, we examine the eect of the housing reform on housing and employment
status.

Between 1986 and 2005, employment in private rms increased from zero

to 6.7% of the total urban labor force.

3 We nd that the housing reform accounts

for 30 percent of the total increase in labor supply to private enterprises.

This

is driven by an increase in the number of workers employed by private businesses
rather than the number of business owners (i.e. entrepreneurs). The distinction is
important since self-employment in small private businesses may also reect disguised
unemployment.

A possible concern is that the eects of housing reform may be

confounded with the eects of other concurrent changes, such as overall provincial
growth or the restructuring of the state sector, that can also aect private-sector
employment. We conduct a large number of robustness exercises to show that our
estimates are unlikely to be biased by such factors.
Third, we use the reform-driven increase in the private-sector labor supply to

3 Note

that our denition of the private sector is more stringent than most other studies about

the Chinese economy in that we examine owners or workers of small businesses owned by individual
proprietors. We do not include large enterprises that were formerly state-owned or grew from stateowned enterprises because such rms typically behaved like state rms with respect to the housing
reform. We discuss this in more detail in Section 4.

3

estimate the wage elasticity of labor demand in the private sector.

We nd that

increasing the labor force by 1% reduces wages by approximately 0.18% to 0.32%
in the private sector, which implies a labor demand elasticity of approximately 3.1
to 5.5. Note that since we observe the cities in our sample for up to at least eight
years after the introduction of the housing reform, our labor demand estimates are
the average of the short and medium-run eects.
In addition to the main analysis, we provide suggestive evidence on the dynamics
of private- and state-sector wages and nd that prior to the reform, the residualized
wages (controlling for individual characteristics and city xed eects) are higher in
the private sector.

When the reform is introduced, wages immediately converge

between the two sectors, suggesting that the increase in labor mobility eliminated
the rents earned by private-sector workers.
Our ndings contribute to a large literature on economic transition and structural
change.

Existing empirical studies in this literature have mostly been descriptive

or have focused on cross-country comparisons.

4

We add to these by using micro

data and a policy experiment to provide detailed and well-identied evidence that
untying benets from state-sector employment can be an eective policy for gradually
releasing labor into the private sector, and that private-sector labor demand can be
elastic even when the sector is young and very small.

5 Finding that labor demand

is highly elastic is consistent with past studies which nd that private enterprises

4 The

literature on transition is large and space constraints prevent us from citing all of the

papers. Please see Guriev and Megginson (1997), Megginson and Netter (2001) and Roland (2002)
for overviews of this literature. Also, see Aghion et al. (1994) for details of the transition experience
in Eastern Europe, Shleifer (2005) for a review of the evidence on Russia, and Rutkowski (1996)
and Svejnar (1999) for empirical overviews of the labor market during transition in Eastern Europe.

5 There

is a large literature in labor economics on labor demand estimation.

Our empirical

strategy is conceptually similar to Acemoglu et al. (2004), who use a policy shock to female labor
supply during World War II to study the U.S. wage structure. Also, see Card (1990) and Angrist
(1996) for seminal studies that use policy-driven labor movements to identify the impact of supply
shocks on wages.The eect of employment-provided benets on labor mobility has been discussed
in the labor and public economics literature on job-lock. For example, see Gruber and Madrian
(2002) for a discussion of employer-provided health benets in the United States.

are important for job creation (e.g.

Berkowitz and DeJong, 2001; McMillan and

Woodru, 2002), and can absorb labor from the state sector (Bilsen and Konings,
1998; Faggio and Konings, 1999) in other transitioning economies.

The evidence

that the increase in labor mobility reduced private-sector rents adds to studies that
investigate why privatization policies are unpopular despite their obvious benets
to the economy at large (e.g., Denisova et al., 2009; Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991;
Zhuravskaya, 2007). Since the increased movement to the private sector caused by
the housing reform was gradual and voluntary, our results provide some support for
gradual transition (e.g., Aghion, 1993; Roland, 1994).

The empirical ndings are

also consistent with the theoretical study by Aghion and Blanchard (1994), which
argues that to avoid unemployment and wage reductions, private-sector job creation
should take priority over state-sector restructuring even if shedding labor from the

6

state sector will increase productivity.

Our general nding that the housing reform had a large eect on urban labor
market choices is consistent with the work of Wang (2012), which nds that housing reforms increased entrepreneurship and attributes this nding to relaxed credit
constraints.

We dier from her study in focusing more on general equilibrium ef-

fects and estimating the private-sector labor demand elasticity, which she does not
examine. Wang (2012) compares individuals that were previously employed in the
state sector to those that were not, before and after 1994, the date of the national
housing reform law. However, we nd that most of the cities in our data had already
enacted the housing reform prior to the national law. Our empirical strategy therefore compares the eects of reforms across cities before and after implementation,
using city-specic reform dates that began in 1988 and ended in 1997. The dierent
strategies may explain why we nd no eects on entrepreneurship.

(1998) provides a review of what happens to labor when governments divest from rms.

This study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background on privatization and housing reforms. Section 3 presents a simple theoretical framework and
discusses our identication strategy and Section 4 describes the data. In Section 5,
we estimate the eect of the housing reform on employment decisions and in Section 6, we estimate labor demand elasticity for the private sector. Section 7 oers
concluding remarks.

2 Private Enterprise and Housing Reform in Urban China
2.1 Urban Economic Transition
As with many other transitioning economies, the Chinese government's ocial position during the early period of transition was to tolerate and not interfere with the
emerging market economy, rather than to proactively assist it. Private enterprises
therefore faced several barriers to growth during the period of our study, 1986-2005,
including limited access to formal credit and legal contract enforcement. For example, in 2003, even with the most expansive denition of what constitutes a private
enterprise, the private sector accounted for only 1.75% of loans from all formal -

nancial institutions in China.

Bank, banks began to make loans to small and medium enterprises starting in 2004.

8

The stock market was also of little use to new enterprises since a rm needs to reach
a certain size before it can become public.

Of the 976 companies listed on the

Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in 1999, only eleven were non-state rms
(Huang, 2003). It is widely believed that new enterprises mostly raised capital with
own savings and informal credit (McMillan and Woodru, 2001). Private enterprises

and limited contract enforcement is important to keep in mind for interpreting the
results since they can limit rm growth. Despite the lack of contract enforcement,
it is widely believed that Chinese business owners faced little government predation
and a low risk of expropriation, which may have encouraged private-sector growth

10

relative to other low- and middle-income countries.

Large-scale restructuring of the state sector mostly occurred during 1993-1998.
These reforms divided state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into three groups: rms that
continued to be directly owned and nancially supported by the state, rms that
were allowed to sell equity to non-government entities to raise capital (e.g., other
SOEs and private entities) and rms that were shut down.

The second group of

mixed-ownership rms are among those classied as other ownership in our data,
though the state continued to have a leading role in the control of such rms. For
example, data from the

1998 Census for Manufacturing Firms

show that the state

is the majority equity holder in the average manufacturing rm of mixed ownership;
less than 10% of equity is held by individuals. With political stability as the ultimate
objective, the government was cautious in ensuring that enterprise reform did not
alter urban public goods and social security, which were mostly provided by SOEs
(e.g., Bai et al., 2001; Bai et al., 2006). Thus, when ownership changed from being
state to mixed, the new mixed ownership enterprise continued to provide similar
benets as the state enterprise did previously.
It is important to consider the eect of the enterprise restructuring on unem-

example, Bai et al. (1999) provide evidence that one mechanism for avoiding predation was

to provide urban residents with anonymous bank accounts. See McMillan and Woodru (2002) for
a comparison of the environment faced by Chinese entrepreneurs relative to those in Vietnam and
Eastern European countries. Note that their discussion mostly focuses on the early parts of the
Chinese transition, which was mostly driven by rural TVEs.

ployment. The Chinese government was committed to keeping urban unemployment
rates low during transition and past studies have found that enterprise reforms did
not reduce total employment (Bai et al., 2009). However, workers of both state and
mixed ownership rms were often forced to take early retirement, before the ocial
retirement age of 55 for women and 60 for men) (Giles et al., 2006). These workers
are not counted as being in the labor force and thus do not contribute to unemployment statistics. Some of these workers, who might nd alternative employment after
ocial retirement, are listed as retired and re-employed in the UHIES data. We
therefore create a broad measure of unemployment to include people no longer in
the labor force. In our empirical analysis, we examine both unemployment and retired and re-employed as separate labor market indicators, and verify that neither
of these is correlated with the timing of urban housing reforms.

2.2 Urban Housing Reforms
Until the post-Mao reforms, almost all urban workers worked for SOEs.

Leaving

state employment was extremely costly as it was tied to a range of benets, the
most important of which was employer-provided housing. Historically, urban housing
was allocated by SOEs to workers at a highly subsidized rent. The subsidies were
nanced by the city government.
Housing reforms began in the mid-1980s, as part of the general movement towards
a market economy and also because city governments wanted to be relieved of the
responsibilities of providing housing. It was administratively cumbersome to allocate
housing and the gap between the maintenance cost of the state-owned apartments
and the nominal rents paid by the residents grew over time (Duda et al., 2005).
The rising costs of urban housing provision for city budgets became increasingly
problematic as city government revenues from SOEs declined during the early part
8

of the reform era. In the late 1980s, cities with the most pressing budgetary problems
began to push for reforms that would include selling o part of the old state owned
housing (Yuan, 2000; Pan, 2000).

These reforms allowed part of the state-owned

housing to be sold to employees at a subsidized price.

New workers in the state

sector would no longer be eligible for state housing but workers who left their state
jobs could remain in the same housing if they had purchased it.

housing.

Prices took into account the age, size, location and quality of the

11 In addition, workers were oered concessions (price reductions) based

on their characteristics. The most important was based on job tenure: the longer
the tenure at the work unit, the higher the concession (Wang and Murie, 1999). In
1994, the central government codied the housing reform as a national law called
the

Urban Real Estate Administration Act

to be ocially enacted in 1995. Since

most cities in our sample had already implemented the reform by then, we do not
use 1994 as a reform date. Instead, our empirical strategy will use the city-specic
introduction dates.
The wealth gains from the reform are unclear

ex ante.

We should note that

households enjoyed considerable rental subsidies when living in state-owned housing.
According to our data, during 2001-2005, a person who rented from the state paid
on average 271 RMB (26 RMB/sq m) per month, while a person who rented from a
private owner pays on average 1,362 RMB (71 RMB/sq m). Wang (2012) uses price
and rent subsidy data from the China Household Income Project and calculates that
the average price subsidy for purchase was approximately 24,462 RMB while the

11 The

basic guideline was that the price of a new apartment should not be higher than three

times the average household annual income in a city. If buying an older house, the price should be
adjusted according to a depreciation formula that fully depreciated the house over 75 years.

9

present discounted value of rental subsidies was approximately 20,223 RMB. She
concludes from this that the subsidized purchase price oered in the housing reforms
did little to increase overall household wealth.
The gains in wealth, moreover, were dicult to realize in practice.

Privately

owned housing could not be sold until the implementation of a second reform which
allowed the trading of housing on the market. We collect data on the date of this
second policy and include it as an additional control in our robustness checks, to verify that our results are not arising due to wealth gains for households. Furthermore,
we should note that state-owned banks did not make loans to households until very
recently. Therefore, new property owners did not have the ability to use their newly
acquired housing as collateral for business or other types of loans.

3 Conceptual Framework
3.1 Private Sector Labor Supply and Wages
To frame the key questions of this investigation, it is useful to briey discuss the
theoretical implications of an increase in labor supply to the private sector. For simplicity, let us assume that the labor market is competitive, and that the private sector
uses two factors: labor (L), and capital (K ) which represents all non-labor inputs.
In particular, consider the simple Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function:

Y = AK α (L)1−α ,
where

(1)

A is the total factor productivity for the private sector, and, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 and

0 ≤ 1−α ≤ 1

are the output elasticities of capital and labor.

Because the labor market is competitive, the wage is determined by the marginal
product of labor. The private-sector wage is thus
10

w = (1 − α)AK α L−α .

(2)

The eects of an increase in labor supply will, in general, depend on how capital
and technology adjust in response to the labor shift:

∂ ln(w)
∂ ln(K) ∂ ln(A)
= −α + α
+
.
∂ ln(L)
∂ ln(L) ∂ ln(L)
In this expression,

∂ ln(A)
α ∂∂ ln(K)
ln(L) + ∂ ln(L)

−α

(3)

reects the direct eect of labor change on wages, while

represents the indirect eect due to the response of the stock of

capital and technology to the change in labor.

Since capital and technology are

likely to adjust more slowly than labor, we assume that the level of capital stock
and technology are held constant in the short run and therefore, the indirect eect
of labor movement caused by capital and technology response will be zero. Thus,

∂ ln(w)
∂ ln(L)

= −α , and we obtain a short-run wage elasticity with respect to labor of −1/α .

Our main goal is to estimate

α

for the private sector. There are two important

points to keep in mind for the interpretation. First, our data observe cities for at
least eight years after the housing reform. Given the rapid economic growth in urban
China during this period, it is unlikely that physical capital and technology are not
increasing in the private sector over this period of time.

Since improvements in

capital and technology mitigates the negative eect of labor supply on wages, the
elasticity estimates we obtain will be larger in magnitude than the actual short-run
elasticity . Second, while we believe that the private sector pays competitive wages
that equal the marginal product of labor, the state sector most likely does not.
Therefore, our empirical analysis will focus on interpreting the private-sector wage
elasticity and will not attempt to estimate the wage elasticity for the state sector.

11

3.2 Identifying the Eects of Housing Reform on Labor Reallocation
We examine the eect of the housing reforms on household level outcomes using
a dierence-in-dierences specication, which compares household outcomes before
and after the housing reform is implemented in a city:

yh jt = θ H jt + ψXh jt + γ j + δt + εhit ,
where outcome
hold

yh jt

(4)

is the outcome (housing status, labor market choice) for house-

h in city j during year t .

This is modeled as a function of a dummy variable that

equals one if the urban housing reform had taken place in that city,

H jt ;

a vector of

individual controls that includes sex, age and the years of education of the household
head,

; and a year dummy variable,

δt .

Our coecient

which captures the eect of urban housing reform. To adjust for the

fact that households in the same city might face correlated shocks in the same year,
we cluster all our standard errors at the city level. Since such clustering may produce downward biased standard errors when the number of clusters is not large (we
have 27 clusters), we also implement a clustered wild bootstrap estimation to test
the signicance of our coecients (Cameron et al., 2008). Both sets of p-values are
reported in the tables. Almost all of our results survive the stringent bootstrapping.
Thus, for brevity, we do not discuss them after this point.
Causal identication assumes that the outcome of interest and the introduction
of the reform are not joint outcomes of an omitted variable. For example, one obvious concern is that private-sector employment and the housing reform might both be
driven by a poorly performing state sector. This could push workers from the state
sector into the private sector and cause budget-constrained city governments, which

12

rely partially on state owned enterprises for revenues, to privatize housing. However,
the main determinant of the timing of the reforms, city government income prior to
the reform, is already controlled for by the city xed eects, along with all other
time-invariant dierences across cities. Nevertheless, to account for the possibility
that cities with lower pre-reform revenues were on a dierent trajectory, we estimate
specications controlling for pre-reform city revenues interacted with year dummies.
Similarly, any changes over time that aect all cities similarly over time are controlled
for by the year xed eects.

This includes nationwide macroeconomic changes as

well as other policy changes such as the introduction of a central government urban
housing reforms in 1994. We also run robustness checks controlling for other concurrent regional changes such as provincial GDP growth rates, provincial growth rates
of state-sector employment and the date of the subsequent trading reforms. Finally,
we also control for pre-reform trends in our key variables of interest, to verify that
what we observe is not a simple continuation of such trends.

3.3 Estimating the Elasticity of Private-Sector Labor Demand
We use the urban housing reform as an instrument for labor supply to the private
sector to estimate the labor demand elasticity. This can be done by using only the
private sector sample.

However, since the choice of an individual to work in the

private sector is partly determined by the reform, this would eectively be conditioning on an endogenous variable. Instead, we use the full sample and estimate the
following equation by two stage least squares (2SLS):

lnwkijt = π1 lnL p jt + π2 [lnL p jt × Pi jt ] + X jt0 γk + Zi0 jt ζl + γ j + δt + εi jt ,
where

errors are clustered at the city level.

12

As before, our standard

The main eect of whether an individual

works in the private sector is also included in the vector of individual controls.
Our estimation strategy closely resembles that of Acemoglu et al. (2004), which
used variations in female labor supply across U.S. states to estimate the elasticity of
demand for female workers.

13 This strategy requires several assumptions. First, since

we are using cross-city variation in labor supply, the implicit assumption is that these
cities are independent labor markets. For the context of our study, where the reforms
are mostly being introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this assumption is
plausible since migration between cities was tightly restricted by policy.

Second,

inter-city trade can be a source of factor price equalization across cities even in the
absence of worker migration. However, cross-province trade in China was inhibited
by the presence of inter-province tari and non-tari barriers throughout the 1990s
(Poncet, 2005). Third, as mentioned in Section 3.2, long-run elasticities can be very
dierent as capital or technology adjusts to these changes in labor supply.
Finally, to avoid the simultaneity bias, we need an exogenous determinant of labor
supply. For this, we use the introduction of the housing reform. The private-sector

12 Note

that we are unable to implement Wild bootstrap for the 2SLS standard errors. However,

since most of the results on housing and employment status show that p-values are similar between
the bootstrapped and non-bootstrapped methods. Thus, we believe that the standard errors are
unlikely to be attenuated by the small number of clusters.

13 While

Acemoglu et al. (2004) use the ratio of weeks worked by women and men as the measure

of relative female labor supply, we use the number of private-sector workers in each city. There are
two reasons for this. First, we do not have data on hours or weeks worked in our survey. Second,
as we will demonstrate, overall labor force participation rates did not change after housing reform,
so that using the number of private-sector workers is equivalent to using the relative number of
workers in the private sector (in the log-log specication).

labor supply,

, is instrumented by the introduction of the housing reform;

and the interaction variable,

lnL p jt × Pi jt

, is instrumented by the interaction of the

introduction of the housing reform and a dummy for whether an individual works in
the private sector. These two instrumented terms can be interpreted as exogenous
(whereas the main eect of whether an individual works in the private sector is
an endogenous choice variable).

is the estimated average eect of a change on

private-sector labor supply on the wages of non-private-sector workers.

π̂1 + π̂2

is

the estimated eect of a change in private-sector wages due to a change in privatesector labor supply (the inverse of the labor demand elasticity). As such, we expect

π̂1 + π̂2

to be negative. Since state-sector wages may not equal the marginal product

of labor, we do not have any

a priori

expectation on the sign of the coecient

π1 ,

which represents the impact of private-sector labor supply on state-sector wages.
Our regressions in Section 3.2 will show that individuals' labor supply choices are
responsive to the implementation of housing reform. For the labor demand elasticity
estimation, we will rst verify that the aggregate private-sector labor supply (obtained by summing the total number of household heads and spouses) also responds
to the housing reform by running the following rst stage equation:

lnLk jt = ϕ0 H jt postre f orm jt + X jt0 γk + Zi0 jt ζl + γ j + δt + εikjt ,
where the log number of workers in city

is a function of:

a dummy variable indicating that the housing reform has taken place

H jt ,

and the

same controls as in the second stage equation (5).
Our identication strategy might yield biased estimates if urban housing reforms
also have an eect on other dimensions of labor supply and labor demand.

An

important consideration, especially for the later years in our sample, is the large
numbers of rural-to-urban migrants who are predominantly employed in the private
15

sector.

This will cause the private-sector labor supply to be larger than what is

reported in the household survey since the survey will miss many migrant workers.
We will therefore present robustness checks which adjust for the fraction of migrants
in the city's labor force. Another concern is that housing reforms could also increase
the demand for labor and average wages in the private sector, if it gives rise to large
scale private development of residential housing. The presence of such a construction
boom will cause our instrumented estimates to under-state the wage reduction caused
by increases in private-sector labor supply, and thereby overestimate the demand
elasticity.

4 Data
4.1 The Urban Household Income and Expenditure Surveys
We obtained household survey data from the

diture Surveys

Urban Household Income and Expen-

(UHIES) conducted by China's National Bureau of Statistics. The

UHIES is a 0.01% stratied random sample of the urban population. We have access
to the UHIES data for 27 cities in fteen provinces for the years 1986-2005.

The

data is a repeated cross-section of households. Only 11% of households owned their
own housing before the introduction of the housing reforms, whereas 73% owned
their housing afterward. This increase is paralleled by a decline in the percentage of
households that rent from the state from 86% to 23% (Table 1, Panel A).

14

Our employment and wage analysis will focus on household heads. For our data,
the denition of household head is arbitrary as it depends on who happens to be
at home to respond to the survey when the surveyor arrives.

Since the average

household size in our sample is three, this means that the omitted members are

14 The

share of households owning housing and renting from the state does not add up to 100%;

the remainder comprise those who rent from the private sector and those who live in other types
of housing.

16

15 In our sample, the average household

head is more likely to be male, approximately fty years of age and has twelve years
of education (Table 1, Panel B).
The UHIES categorizes employment into the following categories: i) employed
by a state-owned enterprise; ii) employed by a collective-owned enterprise; iii) employed by other enterprise; iv) employed by a private enterprise; v) self-employed
or small enterprise owner (hereafter referred to as self-employed); vi) retired and
re-employed; and vii) other. We classify individuals in categories (i) and (ii) as statesector workers. The category other enterprises presents a diculty in classication:
this includes partially privatized state-owned rms (in many cases, the state retains
a controlling share), as well as joint ventures, foreign owned rms and township and
village enterprises (TVEs).

16 Since we are unable to assign this category to either

state or private sector in any meaningful way, we exclude this category from our
main regressions for sector of employment and wages.

17

The UHIES does not report unemployment. To examine this outcome, we construct a broad measure of unemployment based on the number of workers who report

18 Since this measure includes those who are still in school,

no sector of employment.

those who are unable to work because of disability, and those who voluntarily choose
to exit the labor force, it should be interpreted as an upper-bound of unemployment
rates. Consistent with increasing state-sector restructuring over time, we see that it
grows from seven to seventeen percentage-points from before to after the reform.

15 We

show in the appendix that our estimates are similar for the spouse as well as when we

examine all adult household members . For brevity, we will not discuss these results.

16 We examined the composition of this category in some detail using the China Household Income

Project (CHIP) dataset. Less than one-fourth of these other enterprises were joint ventures or
foreign owned in 2005, about half were state-controlled and the rest were of unknown (other)
ownership.

17 Since

such mixed enterprises often had housing policies similar to state-owned rms, we also

conduct robustness checks where we classify these as part of the state sector. Our results change
very little with this addition. The results are available upon request.

18 We

restrict our sample to those between 20 and 80 years of age.

17

To examine the sector of employment, we restrict the sample to households where
the head reports a non-missing value for this variable. The descriptive statistics are
very stark.

Prior to the reform, there was virtually no one in the private sector.

After the reform, 5% of the sample report as being employed by a private enterprise,
while 4% report being self-employed or owning a small enterprise. Analogously, we
see a decline of state-sector employment from 97% to 80%. Consistent with economic
restructuring, we nd that the number of retired and re-employed workers increase
from 1 to 8%.
The UHIES reports total labor earnings for each individual, which we use a proxy
for wages in the absence of data on the amount of time worked. Therefore, our results
should be cautiously interpreted bearing in mind that we assume that the number
of hours worked does not change systematically with the introduction of the housing
reform. Also, the survey questions regarding household income were changed after
1988. For consistency, we do not examine wages prior to 1989, which reduces the
sample size available for estimation of labor demand elasticity. Consistent with the
strong growth of the Chinese economy in the 1990s, average real wages more than
doubled in the post-reform period compared to the pre-reform period.

19

One of the drawbacks of our data is that it under-counts migrant laborers. Before 2002, the survey only sampled households with urban household registrations.
Even after 2002, only a very limited number of households with rural household registration are included in the survey (e.g. only 2% of the sample in 2003 have rural
registration).

20 For consistency, individuals with rural household registration in the

2002-2005 surveys are excluded from sample for the main analysis. However, the undercounting of migrants means that we underestimate the increase in private-sector

19 Note

that these data are not adjusted for ination, which was low during this period. In the

regressions, price changes are controlled for by the year xed eects.

20 This

is probably because the majority of rural-urban migrants either live on the periphery of

cities where rents are cheaper or in dormitories or workplaces such as construction sites.

18

labor supply, potentially leading to underestimation of labor demand elasticity. To
address this problem, we obtained independent city-level estimates of the fraction of
migrants in the labor force in 1990, 2000 and 2005, and use these to construct alternative estimates of the private-sector labor supply in each city. We also collected
data on city-level GDP and government revenue, and province-level GDP growth
and state-sector employment growth rates. These data were obtained from province
and city-level statistical yearbooks, and will be used as robustness controls for our
regression analysis.

4.2 Housing Reforms
We construct a unique data set of housing reform dates by collecting information on
the date when workers were rst allowed to buy their houses from their work units.
We will refer to this reform as the housing reform hereafter. We also collected data
on the dates of the introduction of subsequent housing reforms that allowed owners
of private housing to rent or sell on the market (referred to as the second reform).
Information on both reforms was obtained by a search of the city-level newspapers.
Our nal data set contains 27 prefecture or higher level cities for which we have both
the reform date and household data over the entire 1986-2005 period.

21

The cities in our sample began to implement the reform in 1988. By the time that
the national law was proclaimed in 1994, 93% of the cities had already introduced
the housing reform.

cities.

We have housing reform dates for 42 of these

However, only 28 of the 42 cities were included in the pre-2002 surveys.

Of these, one

was a county-level city which was excluded to preserve comparability within the sample.

The

remaining 27 cities are all prefecture or higher level cities, and include all the provincial capitals
or municipalities. Our data comprises around 40% of the households for the pre-2002 surveys and
one-third of households for the surveys since 2002. The cities excluded from our nal data set are
largely smaller or newly established cities. Because of this dominance of large cities, households in
our nal data set have higher income, more educated household heads, and smaller household sizes
relative to the households which are not included.

19

(see Appendix Table A.1).

These statistics reveal several important facts.

First,

they show that there is substantial variation in the timing of the introduction of
the housing reform for our empirical strategy to exploit. Second, the fact that the
earliest reforms occurred at the beginning of the period of our study means that
we will not be able to examine pre-trends for each year before the reform without
losing a substantial number of observations. Third, since 93% of cities had already
introduced the housing reform by 1994, it would be inappropriate to use the national
law in 1994 as a uniform reform date for all of China. Finally, the fact that the last
city to implement the housing reform did so in 1997 means that our analysis, which
uses data up to 2005, should be interpreted as the eect of labor supply shifts on
wages for an eight-year period (i.e. the average of the short- and medium-run eects).
According to the qualitative evidence, low government revenues was the main
determinant of early introduction. We check whether this was true on average by
examining the correlation between housing reform timing and city government revenues, which are reported by city-level statistical yearbooks. We aggregate our data
to the city level and estimate the correlation between the year of introduction and
the pre-reform average log government revenue measured in 1980-1986.

When we

regress the year of the housing reform on log city government revenues, we nd that
the R-square is 0.82, which means that pre-reform city government revenues explains
82% of the variation in the timing of the reforms across cities (results not shown in
tables).

This provides strong support for the belief that the main determinant of

timing of the housing reform was pre-reform city government revenues.
Before presenting the regression results, we examine the evolution of the outcomes
of interest before and after the introduction of the housing reform to see whether
there is a pre-trend. This also allows us to investigate whether the outcomes begin
to change when the reform is introduced. Otherwise, we would be concerned that
20

our post-reform estimates capture spurious trends. Figure 1 plots private housing
ownership against the number of years since the housing reform. Year 0 indicates
the rst year of the reform. It shows little change over time prior to the housing reform and then a gradual but continuous rise afterwards. Figure 2 plots the analogous
gure for the fraction of workers employed by a private enterprise.

It shows that

there are almost no workers in the private sector prior to the housing reform, but
afterwards, there is a gradual and continuous increase. Both gures indicate that
there is no pre-trend prior to the introduction of the housing reform and the trend
break in the outcomes occurs at the time of the reform. Figure 3 plots private-sector
entrepreneurship against the number of years since the housing reform. Although
there is an increase over time, we see that the gradual increase begins three years
prior to the reform.

5 The Eect of the Housing Reform on Housing Status
and Labor Supply
5.1 Housing Status
Using the dierence-in-dierence specication shown in equation (4), we nd that
the housing reform increased the probability of a household owning their home by
6.8 percentage-points (table 2, column 1). The coecient is statistically signicant
at the 10% level. The baseline estimates control for the age, sex and years of educational attainment of the household head. In column (2), we additionally control for
the quadratic terms of the age and schooling of the household head to allow their
inuences to be non-linear. The estimates are unchanged. In column (3), we include
controls for the interaction of year xed eects with the household head's age and
with her education. This is to address the fact that the returns to age and education
21

may change as the economy liberalizes. Our estimates are larger in magnitude and
statistical signicance with this specication.

5.2 Private-Sector Employment
We nd that individuals are signicantly more likely to be involved in private-sector
work after cities implement urban housing reforms (Table 3, column 1). The reform
increased the probability of a household head working for a private business by two
percentage-points, which is statistically signicant at the 5% level. The estimates are
very robust to dierent ways of controlling for individual characteristics in columns
(2) and (3). In contrast, we nd no eect of housing reform on the probability of
the household head being self-employed or owning a small enterprise (columns 4-6).
The coecient is small in magnitude and statistically insignicant.
Given that the overall probability of employment in the private sector increased
from zero to 6.7 percent over the period 1986-2005 , our estimates imply that housing
reforms account for 30 percent of the overall increase in private-sector employment
over this period.

Similarly, since total private-sector employment  i.e., including

employees and self-employed/small enterprise owners  increased from zero to 12.1
percent, our estimates imply that the reform explains approximately 16.5% of the
overall increase in private-sector labor supply.
The probability of renting housing from the state or state-sector employment are
both decreasing almost one-for-one with the increase in private housing and privatesector employment respectively, though the estimated coecients are statistically
insignicant (results available upon request).

22 That

22

these estimates are imprecise is probably due to the fact that the changes caused by

the housing reform are small compared to the total number of state-sector workers and the total
number of those that rent from the state.

22

5.3 Layos and Unemployment
The main concern for interpreting the eects of the housing reform on private-sector
employment as causal arises from the possibility that the timing of the housing reform and private-sector employment are both outcomes of omitted factors such as
a decline in state-sector productivity, or a boom in the private-sector for unrelated
reasons (e.g., state enterprise restructuring).

In that case, the estimates will con-

found the impact of the housing reform with the inuences of these other factors.
We investigate this possibility with two placebo exercises.
The most obvious way of investigating whether the housing reforms coincided
with the decline of the state sector is to examine the eect of these reforms on unemployment and worker layos from SOEs, which were a prominent feature of the
enterprise restructuring that took place in the mid and late 1990s. Our rst indicator
for the health of the state sector is the proportion of retired and re-employed workers, which refers to state-sector workers that have gained employment after retiring
from the state sector.

During the transition process, to increase the protability

of SOEs (and newly privatized rms), workers were often oered early retirement
packages.

A special category for such workers was created in the UHIES. There-

fore, we can investigate the extent to which the housing reform coincided with such
voluntary layos by examining the eect of the housing reform on the probability
that a workers is retired and reemployed. Under our preferred interpretation, the
housing reform should have no eect on this placebo outcome. We nd that this is
indeed the case: housing reforms have no eect on the probability of being retired
and re-employed (Table 4, columns 1-3 ).
An obvious drawback of this measure is that it only measures retired or laid-o
workers that have successfully regained employment. Some of the workers laid o
during SOE restructuring might instead choose to exit the labor force or go back
23

to school for further training.

To address this, we construct a second indicator

to measure the upper-bound of total unemployment (see Section 4).

The sample

used for this exercise is larger than the main sample used earlier because the main
sample includes only the working age individuals that report some employment.
Table 4, columns 4-6 show that the reform had no eect on this broad measure of
unemployment. This is consistent with our preferred interpretation that the main
eect of housing reforms was to induce workers to enter the private sector.
The results presented thus far reect the employment status of the household
head. We nd similar eects for spouses and for all adult members of the household.
For the latter, we use the number of household members working in a given sector
as our dependent variable (see Appendix Table A.2).

5.4 Robustness
In this section, we show that our results on the increased probability of privatesector employment are not driven by potential confounding variables such as other
macroeconomic trends. We focus on employment by a private enterprise since the
baseline estimates for self-employment were insignicant.

Further Housing Reforms

We begin by controlling for the introduction of the

second housing reform that legalized the sale of private housing. Table 5 shows that
our main result is robust and the initial housing reform is not confounded by later
reforms (column 1). Since the second reform is the one that allowed households to
sell or rent (i.e., monetize) their privately owned housing, the robustness of our main
estimate means that our main result is present regardless of whether households were
allowed to monetize their housing.

Since households could also not easily borrow

against the expectation of future wealth, this means that our results are unlikely
to be driven by wealth eects. Thus, the results are consistent with our preferred
24

interpretation that our estimate of the housing reform eect reects the reduction
in mobility cost caused by untying housing access from state-sector employment.

Macroeconomic Trends

Next, we individually control for variables that are cor-

related with regional economic performance, and in particular, the performance of
the state and private sectors in each region, by including province-level GDP growth
rates and province-level state-sector employment growth rates as additional regressors. Neither of these changes the main coecient on the impact of urban housing
reform (Table 5, columns 2-3).

City Characteristics Since the timing of housing reform was in part determined
by the city's scal needs, we would like to control for city government revenues.
However, the implementation of housing reforms could in turn have a direct eect on
city government income (e.g. city governments are responsible for funding housing
subsidies and are the recipients of the money paid for housing purchases).

We

instead control for pre-reform city government revenues (averaged over 1986-88),
interacted with the full set of year dummy variables. Similarly, coastal regions grew
signicantly faster than interior regions during the period of our study. We control for
this dierential growth pattern by including controls for a coastal province dummy
interacted with a full set of year dummies (note that the time-invariant eects of
being coastal are already captured by the city xed eects). We nd that the eects
of housing reform on private sector employment are not confounded by any of these
other characteristics; our coecient increases in magnitude with the inclusion of
these controls and retains its statistical signicance (Table 5, columns 4-5).

Pre-existing Trends Figure 2 already indicates that our estimates on private sector
employment are unlikely to be driven by pre-existing trends. Nevertheless, we control
25

for pre-reform sector-specic employment growth rates interacted with a full set
of year dummies.
columns 6-7).

Our estimates are not aected by this specication (Table 5,

We conclude that our main results are unlikely to be driven by

omitted variables.

6 Private-Sector Labor Demand Elasticity
6.1 Main Results
In this section, we use the housing reform as an instrument for labor supply to
estimate the eect of a change in labor supply on wages, using equation (5), where
we dene the private sector to include both self-employment and working for a
private enterprise. The rst stage regressions for this two-stage procedure, based on
equation (6) are shown in Appendix Table A.3. As we might expect, the housing
reform strongly predicts total private-sector labor supply.

23

The instrumented second stage is presented in Table 6. The coecient for the uninteracted labor supply term shows that increasing the private-sector labor force has
a small and statistically insignicant impact on wages in the state sector (estimates
of

in column 1).

on wages in the private sector.
joint estimate of

The interaction

It is statistically signicant at the 5% level.

The

(shown at the bottom of the table) is negative and shows

that increasing private-sector labor supply by 1% reduces private-sector wages by
0.30%, implying a private-sector labor demand elasticity of 3.38. The joint estimate
is statistically signicant at the 10% level of signicance (p-value = 0.072).

23 The

F-statistics for the rst stage regressions are large, greater than 10 in most cases even

after adjusting for within-city correlation in standard errors. Note that these rst stage coecients
remain stable and statistically signicant even after controlling for a variety of other macroeconomic
trends, including the share of migrant workers in the city population (Table A.3, columns 2-5). We
also present the reduced form estimates for the analogous specications in Appendix Table A.4.

26

In columns (2)-(5), we gradually add controls for macroeconomic conditions that
were discussed earlier used before: provincial GDP growth, provincial state-sector
employment growth, pre-reform city income interacted with year xed eects and
dierential trends for coastal and interior provinces. We see that the estimated interaction eect

π̂2

is very stable across all of these specications and always statistically

signicant, while the estimates of

π̂1

are never distinguishable from zero. The mag-

nitude of the joint estimates is also extremely stable across the specications, and
suggests that increasing private-sector labor supply by 1% can reduce private-sector
wages by 0.23-0.32%, implying a labor demand elasticity in the range 3.1-4.4.
The main concern for these estimates is that state-sector workers are not paid
their marginal product and if state workers are paid more after the housing reform
(e.g., because they now receive lower housing subsidies), then the interaction eect
(which measures the change in the dierence between private- and state-sector wages)
may be driven spuriously by changes in state-sector pay.

We believe that this is

unlikely for several reasons. First, as we will show later, the wage residuals for statesector workers experience little change after the housing reform. Second, the main
measurement problem with state-sector wages is the exclusion of non-wage benets
such as housing subsidies. If these are added to the pre-reform state-sector wage,
then the decline in state-sector wage will be

smaller

than what it appears in the data

such that our estimates are likely to be attenuated. In any case, we can address this
directly by imputing the amount of housing subsidies for state-sector workers and
adding it to the wages of state-sector workers for the pre-reform period.

24 To impute the housing subsidies,

24 Column

we use data on rent and the quality of housing (e.g., total area,

total living area, amenities, city and year xed eects) for private-sector workers that rent housing
from private owners and data on the quality of housing from pre-reform state-sector workers to
predict the market value of the rent for these workers. Then, we subtract the actual value from
the market value to estimate the state subsidy, and add the subsidy to the earnings of pre-reform
state-sector workers. These variables are reported by the UHIES and the estimates are available
upon request.

27

(6) shows that this makes little dierence to our estimates.
Another concern for interpreting our estimates is the undercounting of migrant
workers in our household survey. Since almost all migrant workers are employed by
private enterprises, our data will understate the contribution of private enterprises
to total urban employment. Moreover, if migrants are attracted to cities that have
implemented housing reforms because it is easier to obtain housing in those cities,
then our estimates of the eect of the housing reform on private-sector employment
will understate the true eect.

The best approximation of migration during this

period suggests that rural migrants increased from approximately 30 million in 1989
to 113 million in 2005 (Zhan, 2005).
We address this potential bias by obtaining data on the fraction of migrants (as
a share of the total urban workforce) for the cities in our sample, and recalculating
the private-sector labor supply to include migrant workers, with the assumption that
all of these migrant workers are employed by the private sector.

25 In our data, the

share of migrants in the total urban workforce increased from about 9% in 1990 to
about 23% in 2005. Column (7) shows that the 2SLS estimates using this adjusted
private-sector labor supply variable are very close to the baseline in column (1).
Thus, we believe that our estimates are unlikely to be biased by the exclusion of
illegal migrants.

6.2 Caveats
We re-state the caveats for interpreting the labor demand elasticity estimates. First,
recall from Section 3 that we assume that other factors of production in the private
sector do not adjust to the increase in labor.

While this is plausible in the short

run, it is unlikely to be be true in the long run.

25 We

Since improvements in capital

have estimates of the share of migrants in 1990, 2000 and 2005, and interpolate for other

years in the sample.

28

and technology mitigates the negative eect of labor supply on wages, the elasticity
estimates we obtain are larger in magnitude than the actual short-run elasticities.
As such, they should be interpreted as the average of elasticities in the short and
medium term.
Second, our data reports total labor income rather than hourly wages. Thus, interpreting our estimates assumes that the housing reform did not change the number
of hours worked in the private sector.
Finally, interpreting

1/(π̂1 + π̂2 )

as the private-sector labor demand elasticity as-

sumes that both private- and state-sector workers are paid wages that equal their
marginal product.

In particular, the fact that our estimates for the eect of the

private-sector labor supply on state-sector wages is negative (albeit statistically insignicant) is consistent with the idea that state-sector workers are not paid their
marginal products. This means that

π̂1 + π̂2

may overstate the impact of private-

sector labor supply on private-sector wages and thus understate private-sector labor
demand i.e. the private sector can absorb more labor than our estimates imply.
Since any correction of the state-sector wage data would involve a large number of

ad hoc

assumptions, and our estimates of

π̂1

are statistically indistinguishable from

zero, we do not attempt to correct state-sector wages. Instead, we take the more
straightforward alternative and construct an estimate for labor demand elasticity for
the private sector that is based only on

π̂2 .

This alternative estimate is shown at

the bottom of Table 6 and implies that a 1% increase in private-sector labor supply
reduces private-sector wages by 0.18 - 0.22%, implying elasticity estimates of 4.6-5.5,
which are somewhat larger than the previous set of estimates.
Both our original estimates and the alternative ones suggest that the privatesector labor demand is very elastic. Since the share of labor in the Cobb Douglas
production function is

1 − α , it also follows from our estimates that the implied labor
29

share in the private sector is approximate 0.78 to 0.82. The fact that this is higher
than the standard assumption of 0.66 (i.e., two-thirds) is consistent with the belief
that there is too much labor in the private sector, i.e. private-sector rms in China
are under-capitalized.

6.3 Implications for Private-Sector Wage Growth
We nd evidence to suggest that the increase in labor mobility after the housing
reform equalized wages across the state and private sectors.

Figure 4 shows the

average wage residuals (wages demeaned by an individual's age, sex, her years of
educational attainment and city xed eects) for private- and state-sector workers
against the number of years since the housing reform. Prior to the housing reform,
private-sector workers earned higher wage residuals than public sector workers. However, the private-sector wage residuals declined to the same level as the state sector
almost immediately following the reform and stayed at the same level afterwards.
This suggests that prior to the reform, there were rents from working in the private

26

sector, and these rents dissipated after the reform.

We can use our estimates of labor demand elasticity to shed light on the privatesector wages that are implied by the projected changes in Chinese urban labor supply.
For example, if state-sector rms continue to downsize and lay o workers at the
same rate as during the 1990s, then half of current state workers will move into
the private sector in the next decade and the labor supply in that sector will triple

27 Taken literally and assuming that capital accumulation and technology

in size.

26 Note

that we can examine fewer pre-reform years for wages than for housing and employment

because wage data begin to be reported later than the other variables. The results are unchanged if
we add imputed rent subsidies to pre-reform state-sector wages. We note that this result is consistent
with Wang (2012)'s nding that workers who shifted into self-employment later experienced lower
wage gains.

27 In

our data, the share of non-migrant urban workers in the private sector grew from zero to 9%

of the urban labor force between 1986 to 2005, which implies an approximate annual growth rate
of 11-12% for the private-sector labor force.

30

improvements continue at the same rate as in our sample, our estimates imply that
this will result in a 36-44% reduction in average private-sector wages (using our most
conservative estimates). Alternatively, consider the fact that if China continues to
urbanize at the current rate, the urban population share will increase from approx-

28 If all of the new urban workers work in

imately 50 to 58% in the next ten years.

the private sector, the the private-sector labor supply will quadruple in size (even if
there is no change in the occupations of existing non-migrant urban workers), which
will reduce urban private-sector wages by 54-66%.
For the reasons discussed in Section 6.2, these back-of-the-envelope calculations
should be interpreted very cautiously. In addition, note that these projected increases
in labor supply are beyond the range in our sample data, and our estimates focus on
voluntary movements to the private sector, which might decrease as private-sector
wages converge to state-sector wages. In the latter case, large involuntary shifts to
the private sector might result in even bigger wage declines than we estimate. These
calculations only make the qualitative point that rapid labor force movements can
signicantly reduce private-sector wages, despite our nding an elastic private-sector
labor demand. We discuss this more in the conclusion.

7 Conclusion
The goal of this study is to make progress on two questions.

What are eective

policies for gradually transitioning labor into the private sector? What is the labor
demand elasticity in the new private sector during economic transition? Using the
staggered timing of the Chinese urban housing reform, we show that untying housing
benets from state-sector employment accounts for 30% of the increase in private-

example, World Bank (2012) projects that the current rate of urbanization will cause urban

population share to increase from 50% in 2009 to 67% in 2030.

31

sector employment in Chinese cities during 1986-2005. By exploiting the plausibly
exogenous variation in sector-specic labor supply induced by the urban housing
reforms, we nd that increasing private-sector labor supply by 10% reduces wages
by 1.8 to 3.2%; the implied labor demand elasticities range from 3.1 to 5.5.
Our results have several interesting implications. First, nding an elastic labor
demand implies that capital and technology are quite mobile across sectors in urban
China.

Second and more importantly, it suggests that the private sector, even

in its infancy, can absorb a signicant amount of labor without large wage declines.
However, the projected magnitudes of labor movement into the Chinese private sector
are so large that they still imply drastic private-sector wage reductions, if capital and
technology movements remain at the same rate as in our data. Thus, to minimize
wage reductions, Chinese policy makers may want to consider policies that increase
the mobility of other factors of production into the private sector.
Finally, the evidence that increasing labor mobility reduces rents earned by
private-sector workers suggests that transition may be very unpopular with certain
segments of the population despite its potential welfare benets. This is important
for policy makers to take into account from a political economy perspective.
In extrapolating our results to other contexts, it is important to note that the
magnitude of the estimates are specic to the context of this study. In particular,
relative to other transitioning economies, China experienced little political and social
upheaval and steady economic growth.

Nevertheless, the insights that reducing

benets tied to state-sector employment is an eective policy for gradually releasing
workers from the state sector, that large movements into the private sector should
ideally be accompanied by policies that facilitate the movement of other factors of
production and that increased mobility can dissipate rents for workers initially in
the private sector are generalizable.
32

Our study has two important implications for future research on economic transition. First, the results suggest that understanding the determinants and the speed of
the ow of the factors of production into the private sector is an important avenue for
future research. Second, and more generally, most past empirical studies of economic
transition have been descriptive or focused on cross-country comparisons. Our study
provides an example of how policy experiments and newly availably micro-data from
transitioning economies can be used to provide well-identied estimates and enhance
our understanding of the transition process.
