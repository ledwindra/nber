Bilateral Contracts

ABSTRACT

The basic form of economic exchange is a bilateral relationship between

buyer and seller. If economic conditions are common knowledge there is
no problem in principle to determine the efficient quantity to trade.

But if benefits are known only to the buyer and costs are known only to
the seller a situation of bargaining under incomplete information results.

Instead of relying on the vagaries of a bargaining outcome, which might
be quite costly to implement, economic inefficiency is likely to be improved by a contractual arrangement that could be agreed upon in advance.
In such contracts various aspects of the exchange could be allocated to

the two parties involved. For example, a price per unit might be fixed
in advance and the buyer might be allowed to name his quantity in the

light of the information he has about benefits. A more complex version

would present the buyer with a non—linear price schedule. Alternatively
the. supplier might be given control.

While these solutions are fairly well understood, there are other

types of arrangements in which control is mutual. This paper studies
contracts of this nature. We examine the feasibility of implementing
various agreements and the nature of optimal bilateral contracts under

these informational circumstances. When the random influences impact

both parties significantly, full efficiency is not attainable. We show
that contracts

involving mutual control might sometimes be superior

to

the best contract giving one side or the other exclusive dominance.

Introduction

The basic form of economic exchange is a bilateral relationship be—

tween buyer and seller. If economic conditions are common knowledge, there
is no problem in principle to find the efficient quantity to trade. But
if benefits are known only to the buyer and costs are known only to the

seller a bargaining situation results. In such circumstances economic
efficiency might be improved if a contract governing the transaction could

be agreed upon in advance. Such a contract would give control of various
aspects of the exchange to the two parties involved. This paper studies
contracts of this nature. We examine the feasibility of implementing various agreements and the nature of optimal bilateral contracts.

or

One approach to this problem is to give control completely to one party
*
the other. This is seen widely in practice as well as in theory.
A

price per unit may be fixed and the buyer can name his quantity after seeing

the actual benefits that are relevant. A more complex version presents the

buyer with a non—linear price schedule.

**

Alternatively, the supplier may be

given control in a contract with a specified revenue function along which he
can optimize.

These solutions are fairly well understood. When the uncertainty is
entirely or primarily on one side of the market they can duplicate the fully

efficient solution ——

is the quantity that would be traded in a full—

information world. When the random influences impact both parties signif i—

cantly, full efficiency is not attainable. The choice of which side should
govern the contract is then dependent on the elasticity of benefits and costs,
and on the distribution of the random parameters.

The primary gal of this paper is to examine contracts that allow for

mutual control. While these contracts do not have the ability to achieve
the first—best, they may, in some cases, dominate one—sided governance.

In the next section the basic model is set out. It is shom that
feasible contracts lead to traded quantities which, viewed as functions of
the random parameters, have to satisfy a certain partial differential equation.
Section 3 examines the special case in which the quantity traded has a

certain symmetric dependence on the parameters. This case allows us to restrict the partial differential equation in Section 2, obtaining a second—

order ordinary differential equation. Because this equation is non—linear
and because its right—hand side diverges at some points, its solutions

divide naturally into several different types. These are studied inSections4
and 5, and qualitative properties implied by them for the optimal contract
are presented in Section 6.

Numerical methods are used in Section 7 to construct various solutions
and verify the theoretical calculations.

—3—

2. The Model
The basic structure of the model follows Weitzman (1974). There is
a buyer, whose willingness to pay for the good is

(1)

U(q)

+a q2 + cq

where q is the quantity traded. The other party to the contract is the seller,
whose reservation value for q is the negative of

()

V(q)=bq

—6q

Concavity requires that a and b be negative.

All of the uncertainty in the model enters through the coefficients of

the linear terms, c and 6. It is useful to note at the outset that the
efficient quantity is that which maximizes U + V,

q*(E,6) =

(3)

—

*

To insure that q is positive we suppose that E

> 6 with probability one.

In order to use the methods of incentive compatibility, it is convenient to
assume that (e,6) has a continuous bivariate distribution over a rectangle
2

in R

A contract is a pair of functions t,q which assign to each (c,5) the
monetary payment made by the buyer to the seller, t(c,6), and the quantity

received by the buyer from the seller q(c,6). Given any contract and given
the realized values of s and 6 the two players can be viewed as participants
in a game where the strategies are their professed values of E and

and their payoff functions are respectively

6, c,6

—4—

U(q(E,6)) -

(4)

t(s,6)

and
(5)

V(q(c,6)) + t(c,6)

Viewed in this way, contracts are direct Levelation mechanisms in the sense

of Green—Laffont (1979) or Laffont—Naskin (1980). Je will say that a con-

tract is self—enforç or incentive compatible if the true value of

and the

true value of 6 are, respectively, dominant strategies in this game for the

buyer and seller respectively. If a contract were not self—enforcing, the
value to the two players would have to be computed at the equilibria of the

game. Multiple equilibria would typically arise. Little is known about

this

case. In this paper we examine self—enforcing contracts exclusively.

*

Moreover, as a technical matter it is convenient to assume that q(.,.) and
are twice continuously differentiable.

We now give a characterization of self—enforcing contracts. The optimal
strategies for players whose true parameters are E and 6 are determined by
the first—order conditions

(6)

a q(c,6) q(E,6) + q(,6) —

t(E,6)

real line, we can implement discontinuous q(.,.) which nevertheless have a lower

Equation (10) is the fundamental partial differential equation of this

theory of bilateral contracts. In the risk neutral world we are considering,
efficiency and welfare losses can be determined entirely by the relationship
*

between q(c,5) and q (c,cS). Indeed the form of the benefit and cost functions
imply that the expected loss compared with full information is

function of only one of the two variables will satisfy (10). This

is another way of seeing that one—sided contract governance can be made quite
*

flexible by choosing the non—linear price or revenue functions appropriately.
The first—best given in (3), however, is unattainable through any self—enforcing

scheme.

Second—order conditions for the individuals must be respected as constraints. See below.

This result is well known, see Green—Laffont (1979).

—6—

Before specializing and examining the nature of the solutions to (10),
which will be the subject of the rest of this paper, two further points

should be made. The individuals' second—order conditions must hold at each
value of the parameters, and this entails some further constraints on the

functions q(.,.) that can be implemented. For the buyer, we have that

q(q)2 + a q

(12)

q

+ £ q

—

t

<

0

To express this as a constraint on q, note that as (6) is an identity with
E

=c

we can differentiate it with respect to c. Taking the result and sub-

tracting it from (12) yields

q>0

(13)

Similarly, the seller's second—order condition when combined with the first—
order conditions for all 6 yields

(14)

q6<0
Finally, the value of the problem for contracts with one—sided governance

can be seen from the form of (11). With buyer's control, q should be set

at

*

*

the mean of q conditional on the value of c. This results in a welfare

loss of

(15)

(a±b) var (61c)

*
If the conditional mean of 6 is positively related to c with a slope
exceeding unity, then the second—order conditions cannot be satisfied in
such a solution with buyer's control, and the welfare loss (15) is not
actually attainable. We will not discuss this further, as the remainder of
the paper deals with two—sided control contracts, but we will be careful
to insure the second—order conditions throughout.

The second—order conditions (13) and (14) impose

the constraint

Y' <

(23)

which,

1

as we will see below, allows us to restrict the class of solutions

to (20) corresponding to impleinentable contracts.

Equation ( 20) is an interesting sort of differential equation for several

reasons. It has one obvious family of solutions, namely

(24)

P(x) =

x

+c

—10—

for any real number c. In economic terms these are the trivial solutions
for, using (19 ), one can see that they correspond to q(c,S)

a±b

—— a

completely inflexible and uncontingent contract.
There are other solutions to (20 ), and it is on these that we shall

focus. The difficulty in finding some of these solutions can be traced to
the fact that it does not define a unique value of '1" when 'P =

0.

As is well—known

in the theory of differential equations, the existence and uniqueness of a
solution of an equation of order n given n initial conditions is guaranteed
in a neighborhood of the initial point only if the equation is Lipschitzian

throughout such a neighborhood. The irregularity in this equation occurs
at a particularly unfortunate value, 'P

0, which is precisely where q =

q*.

Because of this fact, we will have to discuss solutions other than those
given by (24 )

in

two separate cases: those where 'P has one—sign througout

the range of x, and those where 'P

is zero for some x. These will be called

onc—cincd and tuo—signed contracts respecitvcly, and are analyzed separately
in Sections 4 and 5.

We are looking for solutions to (20 )

over the domain of x that could

possibly arise. It is not necessary that the solution be extendable over the
*
whole real line.
We will see that the solutions other than (24 ) indeed
have the character that they cannot be extended beyond a bounded interval.

*

Indeed we have already assumed that (c,5) lies in a rectangle in R2

—11--

Let us consider, at first informally, the qualitative nature of solutions

where 'Y has one sign. Suppose we are looking for a solution on [x0, x1] and
that we set V'(x0) < 1, as required by the second—order conditions,
and 'Y(x0) >

0.

From ( 19) we can see that "(x0) must be negative. There-

fore Y' decreases further with x. At some x,

= 0 and 'P is at a maximum;

beyond this 'P begins to decrease. In this region 'F" is diverging towards

— because

('P'—1)2 is growing and 'P is going towards zero.

'If =

x —

Solutions with 'P'(x0) <

1,

'P(x0) > 0 for two different

values of
xO

x

Such a solution exists only on intervals where the upper endpoint is below
the point where this degeneracy occurs.

The requirement that the solution exist throughout the range of x can
be viewed as placing constraints on 'P'(x0) and 'P(x0).

If, for example, the

degeneracy were to occur before x1, then the value specified for 'Y(x0) could

be increased. It is easy to see that the resulting trajectory would be everywhere higher and would have a degeneracy at a larger value of x1. In this

way the domain of the solution can be extended. It can also be extended by
raising 'P'(x0), which has a qualitatively similar effect.

One Signed—Solutions to (20)

In order to obtain manageable expressions for the solution, which will
eventually be obtained only by numerical methods, it is useful to convert
(20 )

into

a first—order equation. This can be done because (20 )

Thus (20 ) can be rewritten as the following first—order equation for z:

(27)

'P + (l—z2 = 0

This equation is separable in z and 'P and can be integrated to yield
log 'P =

where K is a constant of integration.
This can be rewritten using (25 )

is a first—order differential equation, linear in 'Y'

although non—linear in Y and x. Actually, it really describes a family of
such equations because 1"(x0) as well as P(x0) can be specified arbitrarily.
However, although (39) snecifies

val. The extent of this domain of Y(•) is determined by the choice of

and i"(x0). Consider (34). Since K > 0 and v(x) < 0 the first term on the
right—hand side is positive. Moreover since for positively signed solutions
v(x) converges to zero (from below) as x increases, the first term is de-

creasing in x. Thus

the design

of contracts is as follows: Given any joint distribution of (E,S), we must

choose 'Y(x0) and

so that x =

This constrains the expression in brackets in (39) and leads to pointwise higher
solutions the larger the required domain.

—16—

5. Two—Signed Solutions to (19)
In this section it is demonstrated that the entire
solutions to (19) obeying Y'

family of two—signed

1 can be generated as follows.

Compute a positive one—signed solution on an interval

the solution "backwards" below x1, as far as possible ——

[x1, x2J. Extend

that

0.

is until '1' -

Call the limit of x for which the right—hand side of (19) is well defined,

x0.

Next, compute a negative one—signed solution over some interval
[x3, x3] and

continue the solution beyond x4 until Y -

0.

Let the value of x for which

this limit is reached be x5. Since (19) is autonomous, one can "shift" this
negative solution by x0 —
x5, obtaining a solution over {x3 + x0 — x5, x0).

Finally, set (x0) = 0.

Composing the positive and negative one—signed

solutions with this point we have a function defined over [x3 —

— x5, x2].

We will now show that this function indeed solves (19), in particular
at x0, and that all two—signed solutions to (19) are of this form.
To show that such a procedure results in a solution to (19) it is only
necessary to show that V't(x0) exists. By construction (19) will then be satisfied as both terms are zero.
As a preliminary result we will establish that Y'(x)

-÷

1 as x -

x0•

Reconsider (28)

(28)

log 'I' =

— log (l—v') + K

The trajectories of solutions in the ('i',i") plane are thus parameterized by

K. We want to show that all trajectories satisfy 'Y' ÷ 1 as
that they all emanate from the point W = 0,

where = 0,

That is that for all K we get a trajectory like A and never like B.
If we had one like B, then take '1" > 'Y' and 'F' < 1. For any fixed K

and 'F sufficiently small, the left—hand side of (27) can be adjusted so

that it holds. Thus ailtrajectories cut every vertical line ('F' <

1)

in

this plane, and hence B is not a possible trajectory.
Now to show that 'Y"(x0) exists (and is equal to zero).

At any point in a neighborhood of x0 we have

Using (29) this becomes

From the previous discussion we know that 'Y'(x) -- 1 along any trajectory.

Therefore

To show that 'Y"(x0) exists we apply the mean—value theorem. (Rudin (1964), p. 93

We

know that 'F' is continuous on

Precisely analagous arguments apply to the left of x0 establishing
that'F"(x0) is well defined in this pieced—together function.

6. Characteristics of the Payment Function

In the preceding sections we have analyzed the nature of possible

solutions to the fundamental equation (19) derived from (10). These results
are important in that they permit a qualitative characterization of the cost
function C(q,5) of the buyer and the revenue function R(q,c) of the seller
with respect to the traded quantity q.

t(c,5),

Given a contract t =

q = q(c,cS) we can, by utilizing the implicit

function theorem,solve the latter to obtain c =

c(q,5),

because q > 0 by the

second order conditions. Substituting this to the former we obtain the cost
function of the buyer C(q,5) =

t

the sign of which is in general uncertain. For the special case of solutions
dependent on (c—5) it is possible to rewrite (49) in terms of the function q'

which was analyzed in the preceding sections. The conclusion is that t[q,5]

—20—

is convex (concave resp.) in q whenever 'F' > (< resp.) —
A similar computation for the seller's revenue function yields the

result
2

R(q,E) =

(50)

—b

+

which in turn implies that t[q;E] is convex (concave resp.) in q whenever
'F' <

(> resp.) —
These results can be interpreted easily by noting that, for example, the

convexity of C(q,5) in q means that the unit price for the buyer is rising,

i.e., quantity premia appear. In the same vein, whenever C(q,) is concave
in q the contract stipulates quantity discounts, i.e., the unit price for the
buyer is decreasing.

This analysis can be conveniently related to the different types of
solution 'F of the basic differential equation (19). Consider first a positively
signed solution discussed in Section 4 above. For then 'F' is first positive,

but as x (=

E 5)

increases it turns more and more negative which implies

that R(q,c) is first convex but it eventually becomes concave. Therefore in
these contracts the buyer faces quantity premia at low levels of the traded

quantity but discounts appear at high volumes of trading. In Section 7
numerical computations illustrate this phenomenon.

For negatively—signed contracts the conclusion is reversed, i.e.,
quantity discounts appear at low levels of trading.

As shown in Section 5, two—signed contracts are pieced from one—signed
contracts on subintervals so that with them quantity discounts are present at
both sufficiently low and high levels of trading while in the intermediate

—21—

range quantity premia are the rule.

These features are illustrated in the

7. Numerical Computations
By virtue of the results in the last three sections a numerical computation of the solutions to (19) can be derived from the one—signed solutions
over fixed intervals (x0, Xmax) with the properties that

limI'lim' =0

In this section we examine some qualitative properties of these solutions.
Finding second—best bilateral contracts, that is those which minimize
E'Y2, is generally a complex problem. Alternative solutions to (19) cannot

be ranked by pointwise dominance. The optimal solution in principal depends

— 5.

Despite this theoretical possibility, our computations show that it is
relatively easy to find a solution to (19) that is "almost" the pointwise

minimizer of y throughout "almost" all of the domain of definition. Therefore, except in extreme cases where the distribution of x is concentrated

close to the endpoints of [x0, XmaxJ this particular solution will serve
as a good approximation to the optimum.
We now describe the numerical method used and present an illustrative
calculation.

Let the length of the interval over which we seek a solution be fixed

at L = x

From (40) we have an implicit relationship between V(x )

Thus for fixed L we consider the one parameter family of solutions to
(39) where '(x0) is fixed arbitrarily in (0,1) and 1'(x0) is given by the

solution to (51) with equality. A standard computer program for numerical
integration was used to integrate the expression for '+"(x) from x0 to x.

Figure 2 displays the results for various choices of tY'(x0) when L =

10.

The central feature of this simulation is that the solution obtained for

is "almost" the pointwise minimizer of the family of all solutions

obtained for values of '"(x0) in steps of .02. Only for x —

This result seems robust to the length of the interval and to step
sizes of i''(x0) used to construct the families of solutions. It is probably
a good approximation to the optimal one—signed solution over this interval
for most distributions of x.

implicit in the optimal contract, using this result as an approximation for the

optimum. This computation was compatible with the results of Section 6 on
the concavity properties of these functions.

This gives us a function E(q,6) whose inter-

pretation is that it is the tannouncementtI of E which, when combined with the
given

value of 6, would induce the given value of q to be exchanged under the

contract F. Finally, the total cost to the buyer of quantity C(q,6), is
defined by C(q,3) =

t(c(q,6),6).

The revenue functions of the seller facing

a buyer whose announced parameter is s, R(q,c), is given symmetrically.

Some of these cost and revenue functions are given in Figures 3 and 4.
It is noteworthy that the quantity discount/quantity premia results of Section
6 are verified in this numerical construction.

Because we cannot find the true optimum without knowing the distribution
of x, and, more importantly, because we cannot find general incentive compatible
contracts other than those in the special case q(c,6) =
