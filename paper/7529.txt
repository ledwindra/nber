ABSTRACT
This paper investigates the impact on bank stock prices of emerging market currency crises and
bailouts. The stock market distinguishes between banks with exposure to a crisis country and other banks.
In general, banks with exposures to a crisis country are affected adversely by currency events and
positively by bailouts. Other banks are mostly unaffected by events in countries experiencing a crisis. The
paper uses the impact of the LTCM crisis on bank stock prices to put the emerging market events in
perspective. The LTCM crisis had no significant contagion effects in the banking sector either, but banks
that participated in the LTCM rescue experienced negative stock returns when the rescue was announced.

A striking development in the 1990s has been the emergence of the view that events in
emerging markets could endanger the stability of the global financial system. As former Secretary
of the Treasury Rubin puts it in an interview, "I can't imagine that twenty or twenty-five years
ago my predecessors would have been worried about an economic crisis in Thailand or Indonesia,
or even Korea." (Friedman (1999), p. 186). The events of 1998 seem to provide evidence in
support of this view. As one observer puts it, "the entire global economic system as we know it
almost went into meltdown, beginning with Russia's default" (Friedman (1999), p. 212).
As a response to the perceived threat to financial stability from emerging market crises, the
1990s have seen bailouts of unprecedented size. Mexico, Korea, and Brazil received packages of
aid in excess of $40 billion each. Thailand, Indonesia, and Russia received packages between $10
billion and $40 billion. The proponents of bailouts have argued that they were necessary to
prevent contagion and systemic threats. The critics of bailouts have pointed out that they heighten
moral hazard, so that banks find it optimal to take bigger gambles because they do not suffer as
much if the gambles fail.
In this paper, we examine the impact of crises and bailouts on U.S. bank stock prices to
assess some of the issues raised by proponents and opponents of bailouts. First, we investigate
whether currency crises in emerging markets had a significant impact on banks. After taking into
account movements in the stock market, banks without exposure to the country in trouble were
generally not affected by the adverse events but banks with exposure were. Second, we examine
the impact of the largest bailouts. We find that they significantly benefited banks with exposure to
the bailed out country and generally had no significant impact on banks without exposure. Third,
we consider the LTCM crisis, which is useful to put emerging market crises in perspective since
no public funds were used in the bailout. The banks which participated in the LTCM rescue lost
dramatically when the LTCM losses became known and when the rescue was announced.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 presents our sample and exposure measures. Section
2 provides estimates of the impact of adverse currency events in the Mexican, Korean, Russian,
and Brazilian crises on U.S. banks. Section 3 shows the effect of the bailouts of Mexico, Korea,
and Brazil on U.S. banks. Section 4 focuses on the LTCM events. Section 5 concludes.

1. Data and measurement issues.
We use the method of event studies commonly used in finance. We therefore identify
relevant events and estimate their impact on stock prices. Our hypothesis is that systemic threats
decrease bank stock prices because they affect adversely the value of banking franchises.
To evaluate the impact of events, we regress bank portfolio daily excess returns (the
return minus the risk-free rate) on the excess returns of the Datastream U.S. market index, on
changes in the 7-day Eurodollar rate, and on dummy variables for the event days. The estimates
of the dummy variables are the abnormal returns reported in this study. Table 1 provides the
abnormal returns on key dates.1 One might argue that controlling for market movements is
inappropriate since the events might be causing the market movements. We discuss market
movements when relevant. For all the crises considered, we start the sample period in January of
the year of the crisis and include at least 319 trading days. We use the banks that belong to the
Datastream retail banking index.
Event studies are based on the presumption that the market impounds all the new
information in stock prices immediately. Because of this presumption, there are two difficulties
with event studies. First, the importance of an event might be underestimated because stock prices
already partially or completely reflected its economic impact before it occurred. Second, an
announcement may take place after markets are closed on that day, so that the stock-price

The appendix reproduces the regression estimates, the list of exposed and non-exposed banks for each
country, and the list of relevant dates. Kho and Stulz (2000) apply this approach to events of the East Asian
crisis and discuss the robustness of results when this approach is used.

reaction takes place on the next day when markets are open. We deal with these difficulties by
including as event days the trading days before and immediately after the news announcement.
To identify banks exposed to a country, we use the exposure reported in annual reports as
closely as possible to the first event date associated with the country's crisis, assuming that the
market knows these exposures. We then construct portfolios of exposed and of non-exposed
banks. Exposed banks are those that report a positive exposure to the crisis country. Banks did not
report exposure to LTCM. Further, while a bank might have been a counterparty to LTCM or
have lent to LTCM, it might also have been affected by the LTCM crisis because it attempted to
mimic LTCM's positions. We consider those banks that participated in the rescue of the fund
exposed since these banks were willing to put up their own funds to prevent the crisis from
worsening.
A systemic risk should affect all banks, not just the large ones, so that equally-weighted
portfolios of banks are most relevant to estimate the impact of events on systemic risk. However,
an alternative view is that the large banks which dominate value-weighted portfolios are those
that matter when one is concerned about the financial system. We therefore point out some
differences that arise when we use value-weighted portfolios.

2. Do emerging market crises matter for the U.S. financial system?
Mexico devalued its currency on December 20, 1994 and announced the next day that the
parity would no longer be defended. These currency events impacted the market on December 21.
On that day, exposed banks had an abnormal return of -1.37% (the p-value or p in the following
is 0.03). In contrast, the other banks had an abnormal return of –0.03%, so that exposed banks
performed worse by 1.34% (p = 0.01). In the case of Korea, the exposed banks had an abnormal
return of -1.5% (p = 0.07) on the trading day before Korea stopped defending its parity, but the
abnormal return is not significantly different from the non-exposed banks.

3

With Russia, non-exposed banks had an abnormal return of –1.40% (p = 0.06) on the day
of the devaluation and of the default on various debt instruments, while the exposed banks had a
positive insignificant abnormal return of 0.11%. Exposed banks lost 2.11% (p = 0.13) on the day
of the suspension of the ruble convertibility, August 28, and lost 4.19% (p < 0.01) on the day
before. Yet, non-exposed banks had an insignificant total abnormal return over these two days of
-0.35%. The banks experienced significant positive abnormal returns on August 31. On the three
trading days around the suspension of the convertibility, the Datastream index for the U.S. market
fell by a dramatic 11.74%. Including the market fall, exposed banks lost 17.91% on these three
days, while non-exposed banks slightly outperformed the market since they lost 10.77%. Around
the Russian events, liquidity in markets dried up dramatically. It is therefore important to note
that, since the banks exposed to Russia include banks with large derivatives and proprietary
businesses, the losses of these banks may have been due more to the impact of liquidity drying up
than to the impact of the events on the credit risk of loans to Russia held by these banks.
For Brazil, there was a significant capital outflow at the beginning of September 1998
which overlapped with the LTCM announcements. On September 3, banks exposed to Brazil lost
4.57%. Banks that were not exposed lost an insignificant 0.63%. Banks exposed to Brazil but not
exposed to LTCM had an abnormal return of -2.18% (p = 0.05) on September 3. The devaluation
of the real had no impact on banks. When Brazil announced it would no longer defend its parity,
exposed banks fell by 2.43% (p = 0.04) and non-exposed banks fell by 1.22% (p = 0.08) on the
next trading day.
Based on our evidence, currency events in emerging markets matter for U.S. banks.
However, they affect exposed banks and leave non-exposed banks largely untouched. It is hard to
argue that the events considered are economically important for non-exposed banks after taking
into account market movements.

3. Bailouts and U.S. banks.
Looking at the mega-bailouts of Mexico, Korea, and Brazil, we find that in each case, at
least one bailout event surprised the markets. In the case of Mexico, the exposed banks earned an
abnormal return of 1.44% (p = 0.02) on January 25, 1995, the day before the tentative approval of
IMF support, in contrast to the non-exposed banks which earned an insignificant 0.51%. The
difference between the two groups of banks has a p-value of 0.08. No other Mexican event had
significant abnormal returns. In the case of Korea, the critical event occurred on December 1,
1997, when it became clear there would be a bailout agreement. On that day, exposed banks had
an abnormal return of 2.09% (p = 0.01) while non-exposed banks earned 1.22% (p = 0.03). The
difference between the two groups is insignificant. In addition, the U.S. market index earned
1.93% on December 1. One might argue that in this case the IMF program might have had
systemic benefits, but the abnormal return of non-exposed banks is smaller and not significant
when we use a value-weighted portfolio, indicating that the effects on these banks were weak at
best.2 Finally, in the case of Brazil, exposed banks earned 1.95% (p = 0.09) on the day that
negotiations with the IMF opened while non-exposed banks gained an insignificant 0.92% on that
day. The difference between the two groups is not significant, however. On October 8, 1998,
when Brazil and the IMF issued a joint statement, the abnormal return of exposed banks was
3.46% (p < 0.01) in contrast to the abnormal return of -2.44% (p < 0.01) for non-exposed banks.
On that day, the market fell by 1.45%. Finally, on the day of IMF support announcement, the
exposed banks earned 2.53% (p = 0.03) while the non-exposed banks earned 0.14%. The
difference between the two groups is significant.
Russia provides a confirmation of our analysis of bailouts. In the case of Russia, the New
York Times had an article on August 27 that the "IMF steps back." That day was rich in news

2

Kho and Stulz (2000) provides a more detailed analysis of the Korean crisis but considers only three
exposed American banks, JP Morgan, Citibank, and Chase Manhattan Bank. In that paper, the gains of the
three banks are substantially larger than the gains for all exposed banks reported here.

about Russia. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that exposed banks lost 4.19% (p < 0.01)
while non-exposed banks lost an insignificant 0.70%. The difference between the two groups is
significant (p = 0.01).
Our analysis of bailout event returns shows that the informative events had significant
positive abnormal returns for exposed banks and, except for Korea, insignificant abnormal returns
for non-exposed banks. The highest gains of the exposed banks are for the bailout of Brazil. We
can estimate the dollar amount of the increase in the capitalization of exposed banks as a result of
the bailout as follows. At the end of September 1998, the equity capitalization of banks exposed
to Brazil was about $230 billion and the capitalization of non-exposed banks was slightly more
than $430 billion. On the three dates associated with IMF announcements for Brazil, the sum of
the abnormal returns of exposed banks amounted to 7.74% using a value-weighted portfolio, and
thus the capitalization of exposed banks increased by about $17.8 billion.

4. LTCM and U.S. banks.
News about LTCM losses was made public on September 2. On the three days
surrounding September 2, the four banks in the Datastream retail banking index for the U.S. that
subsequently attended the meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had an abnormal
return of –11.04%.3 In dollars, their capitalization fell by slightly more than $8.8 billion. On these
three days, the banks not exposed to LTCM gained $26.86 billion dollars. As a result, banks with
LTCM exposure underperformed the non-exposed banks over these three days by 14.24% (p <
0.01). Perhaps another way to look at the banks exposed to LTCM is the following. The four
banks had equity of $145 billion on August 26. On September 4, their equity was $102 billion,
corresponding to a loss of 29.45%. During that period, the banks not exposed to LTCM lost
9.35% of their value, going from $596 billion to $540 billion. What we call exposure to LTCM
differs from exposure to foreign countries in that for these exposures banks report a dollar amount

6

of exposure resulting from transactions with these countries. In contrast, the banks that
participated in the rescue of LTCM did not report their exposure to LTCM. These banks might
have lost value simply because the market believed they had proprietary trades similar to those of
LTCM rather than because of credit exposures to LTCM. These banks lost another 3.59% (p =
0.03) on September 24, the trading day following the announcement that they were putting money
into LTCM. On that day, the other banks lost an insignificant 1.02% (p = 0.16). On September
23, some exposed banks performed quite well relative to the market and the market itself
increased significantly. The Citicorp mergers with Travelers Group Inc. was approved by the
Federal Reserve Board, which led to a large increase in Citicorp's stock price, and the Greenspan
testimony in front of Congress changed interest rate expectations. The investment banks with
publicly traded equity that attended the LTCM meeting did not have significant positive abnormal
returns on that day, so that the good performance of banks appears unrelated to news about
LTCM.
There are three lessons from the LTCM events. First, their economic significance after
taking into account market movements for exposed banks exceeds the economic significance of
the crises of Mexico, Korea, Russia, or Brazil. Second, exposed banks did not gain from the
rescue. Third, despite the magnitude of the exposed bank losses in the LTCM events, the LTCM
events did not affect non-exposed banks significantly. Thus, the market was perfectly capable of
distinguishing between banks that were at risk and those that were not three weeks before the
rescue.

5. Conclusion.
Our analysis shows that, for the events we considered, the market distinguishes well
between exposed and non-exposed banks. After taking into account market movements, exposed
banks are affected by events while non-exposed banks are generally not. There is therefore no

basis for concerns that markets react similarly across banks and that therefore banks have to be
protected from the markets. Our evidence raises important questions, especially for those who
emphasize the importance of U.S. systemic risks as a motivation for bailouts. In particular, if the
events discussed in this paper had an impact on systemic risk, why is it that we cannot notice such
an impact on non-exposed banks? One might argue that markets knew that there was no danger
either because they knew that exposures were insufficient to matter for the U.S. banking system
in the first place or because they knew that policymakers would always succeed in making sure
that nothing bad would happen to the financial system. Whatever the explanation for the lack of
an adverse impact on non-exposed banks, the bottom line must be that the markets did not think
that any of the adverse events we considered could have led to significant economic problems for
the banking sector in the U.S. in general. The fact that a subset of banks could lose 29% of their
equity capitalization in six trading days without more impact on other banks is consistent with at
least three explanations: (1) systemic risk is overrated, (2) the market underreacted, and/or (3) the
cleverness of our policymakers is underrated.

as one entity.

Table 1. Abnormal returns of the U.S. bank portfolios around events of crises and bailouts
The daily abnormal returns are estimated using the dummy variable approach described in the text and the regressions
estimates are in the appendix of the working paper version of the paper. Exposed banks are those that reported a
positive exposure to the crisis country in their annual report closest to the first event date for a country, whereas nonexposed banks are the rest of the component banks in the Datastream U.S. retail bank index whose annual reports are
available from Edgar Archives or their web-sites. We report the sample period in parentheses next to the country and pvalues in brackets beside the abnormal returns.

Table 2. Abnormal returns of the equally-weighted U.S . bank portfolios on each day of the Korean crisis
The following models are estimated for the excess returns of the equally -weighted U.S. bank portfolios over the period from 1/16/97 to 7/15/98 (377 days):
J

R pt = α0 + β0 Rmt + γ0 Xt +

∑ D jφ jt + εt
j =1

where R pt is the logarithmic daily return on one of the U.S. bank portfolios described below and Rmt is the Datastream U.S. stock market index return. Both returns are in excess of the
one-day return on the seven-day Eurodollar deposit. Xt is the change in the seven-day Eurodollar rate. φ jt is a dummy variable taking a value of 1 for the j-th event day shown below, or
zero otherwise. Thus, the parameter estimate D j represents an abnormal return for the j-th event day. P-values are in brackets.
(1) : EW of all banks in the Datastream Banking index (N=78)

The following table shows 78 sample banks used in our analyses. YES means that the bank has positive exposures to the
corresponding country based on its annual report. NO means that the bank has no exposures to the corresponding country based
on the annual report. N/A denotes banks whose annual reports are unavailable from the Edgar Archives or their web-sites. For
LTCM, the exposures are determined by the presence at the FED meeting instead of the annual report.

Table 12. Sources of the event dates
The following table shows the sources of the event dates used in our analyses. Our major sources are The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. They are searched from September
1994 to March 1995 for Mexico, from May 1998 to September 1998 for Russia, from September 1998 to March 1999 for Brazil, and from August 1998 to October 1998 for LTCM. For
Korea, we use the chronology in Kho and Stulz (2000) and double -check them as in the table. Secondary sources include Financial Times, the Bloomberg Newswire, the IMF News
Archives (web-site), and other various newspapers.
