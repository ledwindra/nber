    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper quantifies the unequal welfare effects of tax competition. I derive the optimal tax and transfer schedules in a free mobility union composed of countries that can either compete or set a uniform federal tax rate. In the absence of fiscal coordination, governments internalize that any decentralized tax reform can lead to the out-migration of taxpayers at the top of the income distribution while increasing the in-migration of transfer recipients. As a result, the optimal level of redistribution is always lower in the tax competition equilibrium. Numerical calibrations show that being in a competition union rather than in a federal union decreases poorer individuals\u2019 welfare by up to -20 percent. In contrast, the rich experience higher welfare in the tax competition equilibrium due to lower tax rates.\n\n",
