Effects of Emigration on Rural Labor Markets

ABSTRACT
Rural to urban migration is an integral part of the development process, but there is little evidence
on how out-migration transforms rural labor markets. Emigration could benefit landless village
residents by reducing labor competition, or conversely, reduce productivity if skilled workers
leave. We offer to subsidize transport costs for 5792 potential seasonal migrants in Bangladesh,
randomly varying saturation of offers across 133 villages. The transport subsidies increase
beneficiaries’ income due to better employment opportunities in the city, and also generate the
following spillovers: (a) A higher density of offers increases the individual take-up rate, and
induces those connected to offered recipients to also migrate. The village emigration rate
increases from 35% to 65%. (b) This increases the male agricultural wage rate in the village by
4.5-6.6%, and the available work hours in the village by 11-14%, which combine to increase
income earned in the village, (c) There is no intra-household substitution in labor supply, but
primary workers within households earn more during weeks in which many of their village coresidents moved away. (d) The wage bill for agricultural employers increases, which reduces their
profit, with no significant change in yield. (e) Food prices increase by 2.7% on net, driven by an
increase in the price of (fish) protein, and offset by (f) a decrease in the price of non-tradables like
prepared food and tea. Seasonal migration subsidies not only generate large direct benefits, but
also indirect spillover benefits by creating slack in the village-of-origin labor market during the
lean season.

1. Introduction
A shift in labor from rural to urban areas has been an integral part of the process of
economic development, and central to theories of long-run growth and structural transformation
(Lewis 1954, Harris and Todaro 1970). Migration marked American agricultural development in the
19th century, Chinese development in the late 20th century, and has been a feature of the growth path
of virtually every developing country (Taylor and Martin 2001). 1 Understanding the causes and
consequences of mobility – both for the migrant, and for the broader rural society – are therefore
central to understanding development.
A modern literature links migration to development by carefully documenting that workers
are more productive in cities, both within developed (Glaeser and Mare 2001) and developing
(Gollin et al. 2014) economies. 2 The accompanying empirical literature has largely focused on the
benefits of migration to the migrant and his immediate family (e.g. McKenzie et al. 2010, Garlick et
al. 2016), but not the spillover effects on the broader rural economy that are surely central to the
links between migration and development. This study attempts to fill that gap by conducting a field
experiment in which we randomly vary the fraction of landless households in Bangladeshi villages
that are induced to out-migrate temporarily, to generate labor supply shocks of varying magnitudes,
and use those to study spillover effects on the rural economy.
The precursor to this paper, Bryan et al. (2014), encourages a sample of 1,292 landless
households in rural Bangladesh to migrate during the 2008 lean season using conditional transfers to
cover the roundtrip travel cost to nearby cities, and shows that migration significantly improves
consumption in induced households. That simple research design can only evaluate the direct effects
of migration opportunities on beneficiary households, and does not answer questions about spillover
effects on non-beneficiaries. We expand on that design in several ways during the 2014 lean season
to study general equilibrium effects on the rural labor market, and in the process, provide a more
comprehensive evaluation of a program to encourage migration.
First, in addition to randomly assigning migration subsidies to an expanded sample of 5,792
poor landless households across 133 villages, our design also randomly varies the proportion of the
eligible population in the village receiving such offers, because that market-level variation is
Long (1991) notes that over 6% of the US population migrates internally within a year, and about 20% of the
population of US and Canada move over a 5-year interval. Long-run panel data from India and Bangladesh show that 23
percent of men left their village after 17–20 years (Foster and Rosenzweig 2008).
2 This is likely due to the benefits of agglomeration (Combes et al. 2010). There is also evidence that cities speed up
human capital accumulation, producing growth (and not just level) effects in productivity (Glaeser and Resseger 2010).

necessary to track general equilibrium effects on wages and prices. Second, we collect data from
both households that receive the randomized offers as well as households that do not, to track
spillover effects on the migration and labor supply choices of non-beneficiaries. Third, we collect
high-frequency data on earnings and hours worked by week, by location, and by individual worker,
to create a richer description of the effects of migration including intra-household adjustments in
labor supply. Fourth, we collect data from employers in the village to study effects on market wages,
labor costs and profits. Fifth, we collect price data from local shopkeepers to study equilibrium
effects on food prices.
We find that temporary emigration generates several different categories of spillovers. First,
migration decisions are strategic complements: a larger number of simultaneous migration subsidy
offers in a village increases each household’s propensity to migrate, and induces others connected to
them to migrate as well. Second, those who migrate earn much more. Much of the spillover benefits
to non-beneficiaries therefore stem from their own increased propensity to migrate when their
neighbors receive subsidies. Third, when larger numbers of people are induced to migrate away,
there are positive spillovers on the village economy: Both the equilibrium agricultural wage rate at
home and the available work hours for those who stay in the village increase. We use individualspecific data to explore whether departure of the migrant induces other household members to
supply more labor in the village (Rosenzweig 1988), but find that the increase in home-income is
mostly due to primary workers earning more when they return home from the city during weeks in
which many of their village co-residents are away. Fourth, the increased agricultural wage rate
increases the wage bill for employers and reduces their profit. Fifth, food prices in the village
increase slightly on net, driven by an increase in the price of fish (the main source of protein), no
change in the prices of main staples (like rice and wheat), and offset by a decrease in the price of
prepared food and tea at the village tea shops. 3
While we document mostly positive spillover benefits to non-beneficiaries, in theory,
migration subsidies could have produced negative spillovers on the villages of origin. It could have
undermined agglomeration in the village (Ciccone and Hall 1996; Greenstone et al. 2010). Or if
skilled workers disproportionately depart, it could have made those who stay back less productive.
Many scholars have expressed related concerns, that migration “may deprive source regions of
critically needed human capital,” (Greenwood 1997), or “increase rural poverty and income
Bryan et al. (2014) documented an increase in protein consumption in migrant households. It appears that large-scale
male migrant departures led to a negative demand shock for tea and snacks in village tea shops.

inequality,” (Connell 1981). On the positive side, remittances sent by migrants could have enhanced
productivity (Rempell and Lobdell 1978), but as we show, most of the extra income is consumed,
not saved. Recent review articles (e.g. Lucas 1997, Foster and Rosenzweig 2008) lament the lack of
rigorous evidence on spillovers from migration. 4
Our results carry important implications for development theory and policy. First, change in
both work availability and the agricultural wage rate that we document implies that rural labor supply
is not as elastic as labor surplus models (e.g. Lewis 1954) presumed. This paper therefore contributes
to the literature on the functioning of labor markets in developing countries (Rosenzweig 1980,
Benjamin 1992, Jayachandran 2006, Kaur 2015). Second, our results should encourage policymakers
to re-think the various restrictions to internal mobility they have instituted under the guise of rural
development policy (Oberai 1983). Anti-migration bias remains rampant in policy circles, and many
governments, including China, Indonesia and South Africa, have historically reacted to migration as
if “it were an invasion to repel” (Au and Henderson 2006a,b; Simmons 1981). The direct and
indirect benefits we document (both for migrants and non-migrants competing in the same labor
markets) suggest that this mode of thinking, and the associated restrictions imposed on migrants’
transport, settlement and employment by policymakers, may be misguided. Concerns about
emigration increasing rural poverty and inequality appear to be unfounded, at least in our context.
Third, our results are informative about the choice of whether to pursue rural development (such as
rural food-for-work programs or India’s NREGA employment scheme) or to invest in infrastructure
that improves connectivity between rural and urban areas.
This paper contributes more broadly to the burgeoning economics literature on program
evaluation by developing a framework that goes beyond estimation of direct effects on the treated
population. Comprehensive evaluation requires consideration of general-equilibrium changes,
especially if we are interested in assessing possible effects of programs when they are scaled up
(Heckman, 1992; Rodrik, 2008; Acemoglu, 2010). For example, providing skills training to large
numbers of beneficiaries (Banerjee et al. 2007) may change skilled wages, or providing livestock
assets on a large scale (Banerjee et al. 2015) may affect livestock prices. Randomized controlled trials
examining aggregate effects of equilibrium price changes induced by programs implemented on a

Pritchett (2006) shows using census data that agricultural, coal mining and cotton farming areas of the United States
lost 27-37% of their populations to emigration between 1930 and 1990, but the population exodus was not accompanied
by any large decrease in absolute or relative income. Ashraf et al. (2015) describes remittance behavior of Salvadoran
migrants to the U.S. more rigorously, but do not attempt to quantify changes on the origin economy.

large scale are still rare 5, and our results suggest that these considerations might be important. Prior
literature on migration has explored indirect effects through a risk sharing channel (Morten 2015,
Munshi and Rosenzweig 2016, Meghir et al. 2016), but no study estimates equilibrium effects on the
village economy.
We describe the problem of seasonality and earlier research on seasonal migration in the
next section, and our experiment and data in section 3. Section 4 presents a model of the village
labor market with endogenous migration to organize our empirical results on migration, labor
supply, earnings, wages and prices. We present empirical results in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.

2. Context
2.1 Background on Seasonality and Seasonal Migration
Our intervention is designed to enable temporary, seasonal migration. While social scientists
and policymakers have noted the pervasiveness of rural-urban migration in both developed and
developing societies, the facts that (a) most of this migration is internal rather than international, 6
and (b) much of the internal rural-urban movement is seasonal and circular in nature, are less well
known. The rural-urban wage gap varies within the year due to crop cycles, and seasonal migration is
one of the primary methods used by Indians (Banerjee and Duflo 2007) and Bangladeshis (Bryan et
al. 2014) to diversify income and cope with seasonality. Such seasonal fluctuations in rural labor
productivity are widespread in Ethiopia (Dercon and Krishnan 2000), Thailand (Paxson 1993),
Indonesia (Basu and Wong 2015), Malawi (Brune et al. 2016) and Ghana (Banerjee et al. 2015).
Seasonal migration also appears to be more responsive to policy interventions and to changes in
local labor market conditions than permanent migration (Imbert and Papp 2015).
Globally, approximately 805 million people are food insecure (FAO 2016), of which about
600 million are rural residents. Estimated conservatively, half of these people—300 million of the
world’s rural poor—suffer from seasonal hunger (Devereux et al. 2009). In predominantly agrarian
economies, seasonal deprivation often occurs between planting and harvest, while farmers have to

Exceptions are Mobarak and Rosenzweig (2016) and Muralidharan et al. (2017). It is more common for RCTs to track
non-market spillovers on the non-treated, including financial transfers (Angelucci and DeGiorgi 2009), and social
learning (Oster and Thornton 2012, Miller and Mobarak 2015). Crepon et al. 2012 and Muralidharan and Sundararaman
(2013) study aggregate effects in relevant markets, but do not estimate price or (teacher) wage effects.
6 There were 240 times as many internal migrants in China in 2001 as there were international migrants (Ping 2003), and
4.3 million people migrated internally in the 5 years leading up to the 1999 Vietnam census compared to only 300,000
international migrants (Ahn et al. 2003).

wait for the crop to grow. Labor demand and wages are low during this period, and the prices of
staples like rice tend to increase.
These two facts combine to produce a dire situation in the Rangpur region of Northern
Bangladesh, where rice consumption drops dramatically during the lean season. 7 This is an annually
repeating phenomenon known as “monga” in Bangladesh, and by other names in other agrarian
societies around the world (“hungry season” in southern Africa (Beegle et al. 2016), and “musim
paceklik” in eastern Indonesia (Basu and Wong 2012)). The landless poor supplying agricultural
labor on others’ farms are especially affected when demand for agricultural labor falls. They
constitute around 56% of the population in our sample area, and are the target of the seasonal
migration encouragement intervention that we design. Our sampling frame is representative of this
landless population in the Rangpur region of Northern Bangladesh. According to the Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics, there are roughly 15.8 million such inhabitants in Rangpur (BBS, 2011).
According to anthropological accounts, nearby urban and peri-urban areas do not face the
same seasonal downturns, and these locations offer low-skilled employment opportunities during
that same period (Zug, 2006). This contrast suggests a seasonal labor misallocation, or a spatial
mismatch between the location of jobs and the location of people during that particular season.
Inspired by these observations, Bryan et al. (2014) conduct a randomized controlled trial to
encourage landless households from the Rangpur region facing seasonal deprivation to migrate
during the Monga period to nearby cities to find work. They document positive effects of migration
on consumption, and then explore why these households were not already migrating. A conditional
transfer of about $8.50-$11 (equivalent to the round-trip travel cost by bus) increases the seasonal
migration rate in 2008 by 22%, increases consumption amongst the migrant’s family members by
757 calories per person per day in 2008 on average, and also induces 9.2% of the treated households
to re-migrate the following year.
Bryan et al. (2014) show that the fact that these households were not already migrating in
spite of these large consumption gains can be explained by a model in which people living very close
to the margin of subsistence are unwilling to take on the risk of paying the cost of migration and
sending a member away. Even a small chance that the costly migration fails to generate income
could be catastrophic if the household faces a risk of falling below subsistence. Thus, uninsured risk
Figure A.1 uses nationally representative Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data collected by the
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics to illustrate these facts. Figure A.2 shows the drop in labor hours and earning capacity in
the agricultural sector during the pre-harvest lean season using a different data source (Khandker and Mahmud 2012).

creates a poverty trap in which the extreme poor fail to take advantage of migration opportunities
that turn out to be profitable on average. A conditional transfer can address that constraint and
create efficiency gains.
2.2 Studying Spillover Effects of Seasonal Migration
Bryan et al. (2014) only focused on households that received migration subsidies, not the
spillover effects on non-beneficiaries, or any general equilibrium changes associated with increased
scale of emigration. Consideration of general equilibrium effects requires a fundamentally different,
and more complicated, data collection and experimental strategy, which we employ in this study.
To study market-level effects, the scale of our experiment is five times as large, and we
further randomize the proportion of the village population induced to migrate. We also employ a
much richer data collection strategy: (a) Track both households that receive these offers and eligible
households supplying labor on others’ farms that do not, (b) a labor survey of every member of the
household, (c) a survey of landowning employers and business owners who hire landless workers
and (d) a survey of grocers to track food prices. These market-level considerations are policy
relevant, because implementers and funding agencies are advocating for and deploying seasonal
migration subsidies on a large scale as a social policy to counter seasonal poverty (Evidence Action
2016). For instance, Evidence Action’s “No Lean Season” program targets 200,000 households in
rural Bangladesh in 2017 to induce 140,000 moves, and is being piloted at a small scale in Indonesia.
The government of China is moving 10 million people in this decade from remote, rural areas
towards urban areas as a growth strategy (New York Times 2013). Such policy and scale up
decisions should be guided by evaluations of both direct and indirect effects.

3. Experiment and Data
The next two sub-sections set out the details of the experiment and the data collection.
Figures 1 and 2 provide a visual account of the main features of the experiment and the type and
timing of data collection.
3.1 Intervention
The basic form of our intervention was the offer of a cash grant worth 1,000 Taka ($13.00
USD) to rural households in northern Bangladesh to cover the round-trip cost of travel to nearby
cities where there are job opportunities during the lean season. This was a conditional transfer,
where the subsidy is conditional on one person from the household agreeing to out-migrate during
6

the lean season. As offers were made, we let households know that they may have a better chance of
finding work outside of their village, but we did not offer to make any connections to employers.
No requirement was imposed on who within the household had to migrate, or what city they had to
go to. As in Bryan et al. (2014), migration was carefully and strictly monitored by project staff to
ensure adherence to the conditionality.
3.1.1 Sampling
The experiment was conducted in 133 randomly selected villages in Kurigram and
Lalmonirhat districts of Rangpur. We first conducted village censuses to identify all households that
would be “eligible” to receive this intervention in each of these villages. A household was deemed
eligible if (1) it owned less than 0.5 acres of land, and (2) it reported back in 2008 that a member had
experienced hunger (i.e., skipped meals) during the 2007 monga season. We focused on
landownership because land is the most important component of wealth in rural Bangladesh, and it
is easily measurable and verifiable. We used the second question on skipping meals to avoid
professional, non-agricultural households (who may not own much land, but who are comparatively
well off). Our census data suggest that about 57% of households in these villages were eligible to
receive the intervention after applying these two criteria.
3.1.2 Random Assignment
We randomly assigned the 133 villages into three groups:
(a) Low Intensity – 48 villages where we targeted migration subsidies to roughly 14% of the
eligible (landless, poor) population. This is comparable to the Bryan et al. (2014) treatment.
(b) High Intensity – 47 villages where we targeted roughly 70% of the eligible population with
migration subsidy offers.
(c) Control – 38 randomly selected villages where nobody was offered a migration subsidy.
The high vs. low intensity design was chosen to generate significant variation in the size of
the emigration shock, but the precise target (14% vs 70%) varied a little across villages within
treatment arms. This is because our village population estimates were dated (from 2008) for most
(100) villages, and imprecise in the 33 other villages, which made it difficult for us to precisely
estimate the ratio (offers/eligible population) in each village.
The sample of 133 villages included the 100 villages that were part of the earlier Bryan et al.
(2014) experiment, but the majority of the households in our sample are new, and were not included
in the earlier experiment. We show in Appendix Tables A2-A5 that participation in the earlier
rounds of the experiment has no significant effect on migration decisions this year, and therefore
7

does not materially affect the main results reported in this paper on the downstream effects of
migration on income, labor supply and other outcomes. Controlling for village level random
assignment in the earlier rounds does not affect our results either.
Landless households are engaged in both agricultural and non-agricultural work. We had
provided experimental instructions to target non-agricultural households first in some (randomly
chosen) villages, and our randomization of low vs high intensity was stratified and perfectly balanced
by this instruction. During implementation we learned that in reality most households supply labor
to some form of agriculture. We show in Tables A2-A5 that the stratification had no effect on
migration decisions, nor does it affect our estimates of the effect of treatment intensity on migration
or income outcomes.
There were a total of 883 subsidy offers made in the 48 low-intensity villages and 4,881
subsidy offers made in the 47 high-intensity villages. The total number of households resident in
these 133 villages was 36,808.
3.1.3 Timing, Protocol and Logistics
We disbursed grants during the latter part of the monga season, in early November, 2014.
Figure 2 provides a timeline of project activities. Ideally, seasonal migration subsidy offers should
be made in September after the rice planting work is done, but our disbursement was delayed due to
political disturbance in Bangladesh at that time. Despite this delay, we observe high overall take-up
and migration during the late Monga, as well as some post-harvest migration after January. We also
report results on re-migration a year later, covering the full 2015-16 migration season.
All of the implementation activities – the offers and marketing, grant disbursement, and
monitoring to ensure adherence to the conditionality, were conducted by RDRS, a local NGO with
40 years of engagement in Rangpur, and substantial presence in the region. RDRS runs a
microfinance program among other poverty alleviation activities, and this expertise was useful to
handle the disbursement of grants, and to ensure recovery of funds in cases of non-compliance with
the condition associated with this grant.
Innovations for Poverty Action in Bangladesh (IPA-B) coordinated all research activities and
was responsible for testing and fielding surveys, collecting, cleaning and maintaining data. They also
monitored RDRS’ implementation activities to ensure that they were conducted in accordance with
the research protocol.
After the research team conducted the sampling and randomization, they provided RDRS
staff with a list of eligible households in the village and their treatment assignments, and RDRS staff
8

were deployed to the village to implement the intervention. Staff members approached each specific
household on their list and first verified that they satisfied the eligibility criteria. Then the household
was offered the grant to migrate, and the conditionality was stated explicitly. The head of the
household was told that if it accepts the grant, one member would have to use it toward migration
travel expenses, and that this would be monitored. Households were also informed that nearby areas
may offer better chances of employment than their home village.
Once the conditions of the offer were explained clearly, the household was provided
guidance on how to collect the grant funds from their local RDRS office. The RDRS staff member
collected identification information from the household. If the beneficiary visited the RDRS office
to collect the grant, an officer verified their identity before disbursing funds. The grant amount
(1,000 Taka) was large enough to cover the cost of a round-trip bus ticket to nearby popular urban
destinations, with some money left over for a few days of board and lodging. 8
RDRS carefully monitored adherence to the conditionality. After disbursement of funds, an
RDRS officer visited each household to check whether someone had migrated or not. If no one had
migrated at the time, the officer reminded the head of household that the grant he had received was
conditional on migration and that if no household member were to migrate he would be required to
return the funds. The officer made two more visits to the households that had failed to send a
migrant, and requested that funds be returned if migration still had not taken place.
3.2 Data Collection
We conducted four separate types of surveys in 2014-15 to capture effects on labor market
choices, other household impacts, effects on employers, and effects on food prices. We conducted
two additional surveys a year later (after the lean season in the following year) to capture longer-term
persistent effects on households and employers in 2015-16. Figure 1 depicts sample sizes by
experimental cell, Figure 2 lays out the timeline of data collection and intervention activities relative
to the agricultural season.
3.2.1 High Frequency Labor Market Survey of Households
After the travel grants were disbursed in November 2014, we started surveying 2,294
households in both treatment and control villages about their wage and employment conditions. The
We considered the possibility of providing bus tickets to migrants, but the logistics of contracting with multiple
transport companies, and finding flexible means to match transporters to migrants were too daunting. Previous
experience also suggested that it was possible to get beneficiaries to adhere to the migration condition, so we settled on
cash transfers.

survey was administered once every 10 days for six rounds starting on December 22, 2014. We refer
to this as “High Frequency Origin Surveys”. The survey asked respondents about labor market
outcomes (income, time spent working, location, industry) and a brief set of questions on
consumption (essential food and non-food items) and migrant remittances.
We focus on income and labor market outcomes given our interest in general equilibrium
effects, in contrast to Bryan et al. (2014), who largely focused on consumption to evaluate the direct
effects of inducing migration. Income is generally thought to be more difficult to measure well in
rural, agrarian areas of low income countries due to seasonal variation, multiplicity of sources of
income, weekly variation in activities over the course of the agricultural cycle, self-employment and
family employment (Deaton and Muellbauer 1980). This is why we engage in a very expensive
method of surveying, visiting households six times on an almost weekly basis and asking about
income-generation activities of all household members over only the previous week to minimize
recall bias. We also conduct the surveys during a narrow two-month window during which seasonal
and employment variation is minimized. The surveys focus on landless households that have
minimal self-employment or unpaid family employment on their own farm. This provides us with
labor supply choices of all working individuals within each household, the location where they work
(inside the village or at migration destinations), and how much they earn on a daily basis.
This method of surveying produces some ancillary benefits. First, it allows us to track highfrequency movements back and forth between the village and the city. Many migrants travel for only
2-4 weeks at a time and engage in multiple trips during the season. We observe 1.6 trips per migrant
on average in our data. Second, the technique also allows us to track intra-household substitutions in
labor supply, because we collect data at the individual level. Third, it allows us to cross-validate the
direct (income) effects of migration that we estimate, with the consumption outcomes Bryan et al.
(2014) collected using a completely different surveying method six years prior, but administered on a
similar population chosen using the same sampling frame. The magnitudes of income and
consumption effects need to be coherent. Fourth, we can also validate our income estimates from
the high-frequency survey using income measures collected in the endline household survey we
ourselves conducted a few months later.
The high-frequency surveys were administered to 709 households that did not receive
migration offers in treatment villages, in addition to 865 households that did (plus 720 households in
control villages). Our goal was to track whether offers to a certain sub-group of households lead
10

others to migrate, and track any spillover income and employment effects on those households
either at home or at the destination.
3.2.2 Food Price Data: High Frequency Survey of Shopkeepers
We paired the brief consumption module in the high-frequency survey described above with
repeated surveys of 399 shopkeepers (i.e. grocery store owners), or three in each of the 133 villages
in our sample. These were administered simultaneously with the consumption module to collect
prices for the same food items that the consumption module asked households about. We collected
data on the prices of major food items, including rice, wheat, pulses, edible oil, meat, fish, eggs, milk,
salt and sugar. These data allow us to explore whether encouraging migration at large scale in a
village (and the extra income that generates) leads to price effects on food markets. It also allows us
to convert the food consumption effects into monetary values.
3.2.3 Endline Survey
Next, we conducted a detailed endline survey of 3,602 households during April 2015, before
the start of the next rice-planting season. Figure 1 displays the sample breakdown across treatment
arms and across types of households (those who were offered grants and those who were not). This
endline survey collected information on a broader set of questions on migration and other socioeconomic outcomes that were not sensible or possible to ask repeatedly on a weekly basis, as in the
high frequency survey. Core modules focused on collecting detailed information on the migration
experience, including number of members who migrated, timing of migration events and
destinations. The survey also delved into income generated by households (especially from
migration), behavior and attitude changes, risk coping, credit and savings.
3.2.4 Employer Survey
To measure impacts on the demand side of the labor market, we asked 1,099 employers
across all villages about the wages they paid for employees around (and after) the time that we
disbursed migration grants. We also asked employers to provide qualitative assessments of the ease
of finding and hiring workers during that period. We collected data on wages for multiple activities
in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, separately for males and females hired. Almost all
seasonal migrants are male. Unlike the high-frequency wage survey, the employer survey was
retrospective, and asked employers to recall wage and employment conditions for every two-week
period starting mid-October through the end of December 2014. We are confident of high quality
recall because (a) our survey referred to wages paid for specific agricultural activities (e.g. for
planting or for harvest), (b) employers tend to maintain records for their businesses, and (c) survey
11

staff were trained to prompt employers with cues on types and timing of events (e.g. associating the
timing of a given employment activity with a significant cultural or religious event).
3.2.5 Follow-up Surveys 2016
To study the longer-term behavior of households, we conducted a follow-up survey in
August 2016 enquiring about a number of items over the time period beginning mid-August 2015
through mid-August 2016. This survey included questions on migration – specifically, timing and
number of episodes, income from migration and questions about resource sharing by migrants – and
the household’s experience of hunger over the previous year. This was administered to the original
endline sample from the 2014-2015 round of study and we were able to effectively re-interview 94%
of the sample (3,386 of the original 3,602 households). The migration subsidy program was not
implemented again during the 2015 monga season, so this survey captures any longer-run changes
from the intervention carried out during the prior lean season.
The second component of our August 2016 longer-term follow-up survey work targeted the
demand side of the labor market, i.e. employers. We administered a labor demand and wage survey
to agricultural employers to better understand the impacts of emigration on their enterprise and
decisions. The employer labor demand and wage survey was administered to 649 employers across
all 133 villages.

4. Framework
4.1 Offer Intensity and Migration
Our theory characterizes the response of rural labor markets to labor supply shocks
(migration). We define a village as the local labor market in which two types of households interact:
a. Landless households that supply labor
b. Landed farmers that hire labor
Our intervention targeted landless households by design. In any given village, a proportion 𝑥𝑥

of landless households was offered a travel grant, 𝐵𝐵 > 0. 𝑥𝑥 was experimentally varied. A landless

household decides to send a migrant if the net benefits of migration are greater than wage income
from the village labor market,

𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐵𝐵 − 𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) ≥ 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥)

(4.1.1)

Where, 𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 is wage at migration destination, 𝐵𝐵 > 0 for those who receive the conditional

migration subsidy offer (and B=0 for those who do not), 𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼 ~𝐺𝐺(. ) is the individual specific cost of

12

migration, 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 is the cost of migration that can be shared with other migrants (hence a function of 𝑥𝑥)
and 𝑤𝑤 is the village wage which can be affected by the number of departures (hence also a function
of 𝑥𝑥). 𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 is not a function of 𝑥𝑥, because our experimental sample of 5,764 offers was not large

enough to affect equilibrium wages in any of the destination cities.

For the proportion 𝑥𝑥 of households that receive the grant B>0, the probability of migration

can be expressed as,

Pr�𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼 ≤ 𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐵𝐵 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥)� = 𝐺𝐺(𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐵𝐵 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥))

(4.1.2)

Pr�𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼 ≤ 𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥)� = 𝐺𝐺(𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥))

(4.1.3)

For the remaining (1 − 𝑥𝑥) unincentivized households the probability of migration is,
This yields an aggregate migration rate in a village, 𝑀𝑀(𝑥𝑥),

M(𝑥𝑥) = 𝑥𝑥 ∙ G(𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐵𝐵 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥)) + (1 − 𝑥𝑥) ∙ G(𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 (𝑥𝑥) − 𝑤𝑤(𝑥𝑥))

(4.1.4)

First derivative of the above expression yields the change in migration rate as a function of

our field experiment:

𝑀𝑀′ (𝑥𝑥) = [G(𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 + 𝐵𝐵) − G(𝑤𝑤 𝑚𝑚 )] + �−

For any 𝐵𝐵 > 0, the first term on the right-hand side is positive and denotes the proportion

of the population that is not infra-marginal (households that are induced to migrate by the transfer
𝐵𝐵). This is the first order effect of providing subsidies to more people on the migration rate. The
first part of the second term,

𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

< 0, denotes how the shared cost of migration decreases as more

people from the village are offered travel grants simultaneously, which in turn boosts the migration
rate when more offers are made. The second part of the second term,

second term, �−

cost of travel (by permitting sharing) by more than the benefits of staying back at home (to take

advantage of the fact that lean season wages will not fall by as much when many other people in the
village emigrate). The relative sizes of these two factors are testable in our setting: We can compare

4.2 Effects of the Experiment on the Equilibrium Wage Rate and Food Prices
Appendix 1 models the labor supply and demand sides to show how this experiment can
affect the wage rate and labor supply in the village. Since 𝑀𝑀′ (𝑥𝑥) > 0 (more people leave when more
subsidies are assigned), the village wage rate rises in equilibrium with higher intensity of treatment:
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

> 0. This leads to an attendant rise in labor supply among those remaining in the village. The

appendix model makes clear that this simple logic assumes that employers don’t react to the

treatment in the short-run by changing their production function and (for example) substituting
capital for labor. This is probably a reasonable assumption in the short run, and we collected data
from employers to check whether it is true.
The departure of migrants may lower the demand for food in the village, whereas the extra
income they bring back could increase the demand for food. If food markets are not well integrated
across space, then food prices could either decrease or increase as a result. With integrated markets,
supply would adjust, and there should not be any detectable change in food price.
4.3 Model Implications
The spillover channels we highlight in the model are:
1. The propensity to migrate may differ depending on how many others are simultaneously
moving. Bryan et al. (2014) argue that risk aversion is a deterrent to seasonal migration,
which could make migration decisions strategic complements if traveling together mitigates
risk. On the other hand, general equilibrium wage effects in villages of origin would make
migration decisions strategic substitutes.
2. Wages and labor supply in villages of origin increase with a larger labor supply shock,
assuming that the village is a closed labor market, and village employers cannot change their
production technology in the short run.
3. If food markets are not well integrated, local food prices may change with the movement of
people or the extra income. However, if markets are well integrated food prices will not rise.

5. Results
5.1 Migration
We first examine the effects of subsidies on migration decisions. We report intent-to-treat
(ITT) estimates that compare the five categories of people that our experiment creates (see Figure
1): (a) Landless laborers who receive subsidy offers in high-intensity treatment villages, (b) Landless
laborers residing in the same villages who do not receive an offer, (c) Those receiving offers in lowintensity treatment villages and (d) Those in low-intensity treatment villages who do not, and finally
(e) residents of control villages (none of whom receive offers). The ITT regression therefore reports
four coefficients of interest corresponding to groups (a)-(d), with the control villages serving as the
omitted category:
𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂__𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂_𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
+ 𝛽𝛽4 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁_𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(5.1.1)

The main outcome variable in Table 1, column 1 (denoted 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is a binary variable that

indicates that household 𝑖𝑖 in village 𝑣𝑣 in sub-district 𝑗𝑗 sent a seasonal migrant between September

2014 and March 2015. This regression relies only on the random variation generated by the

experiment. 10 Standard errors are clustered at the level of randomization (village level) throughout
this paper. We control for sub-district fixed effects 𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 to be consistent with Bryan et al. (2014), but

results remain similar when omitting those controls. The comparison between groups (a) and (c)

(coefficients 𝛽𝛽1 and 𝛽𝛽3) tells us whether two households react differently to the exact same subsidy
if the number of other village residents receiving subsidies at the same time differs. Similarly, the

comparison between (b) and (d) (coefficients 𝛽𝛽2 and 𝛽𝛽4 ) indicates whether two households facing

the same full cost of migration have different propensities to migrate depending on how many other
village residents are likely to migrate simultaneously. These two comparisons represent our main test
of whether migration decisions are strategic complements, or a test of whether cost or risk-sharing
considerations at the destination dominates general equilibrium wage considerations in the village of
origin. Table 1 reports p-values for these tests in the bottom two rows.
About one-third of the households in control villages sent a seasonal migrant (34.2%), which
is the same as what Bryan et al. (2014) and Khandker and Mahmud (2012) find in multiple years
Appendix Table A1 conducts randomization balance tests. Villages assigned to Control, Low Intensity and High
Intensity treatments are well balanced along observables at baseline. Controlling for any individual imbalanced variable
does not affect any of our main results. Baseline data were collected separately in two sets of villages, and we check for
balance within each sub-sample.

using other datasets. Households offered a grant in the low-intensity group were 24.8 percentage
points more likely to migrate than a household in the control group, where no grant offers were
made. 11 In contrast, households offered a grant in the high-intensity group had a 39.8 percentage
point higher propensity to migrate compared to the control group. This large difference in their
reactions to the exact same offer is statistically significant (p-value<0.001). This suggests that
migration decisions are strategic complements: A household is significantly more likely to take up
the subsidy offer and migrate if a larger number of other village residents have the opportunity to
travel simultaneously. In the model, the �−

𝜕𝜕𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆
𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

� term dominates � 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 �.

This positive spillover even extends to those not directly receiving migration offers.

Households that did not receive an offer, but were located in a high-intensity village had a 9.7
percentage point greater propensity to migrate than households in control villages. Such spillovers
are not apparent in the low-intensity treatment. 12
In columns 2 and 3, we change the dependent variable from “any migrant in a household” to
“Number of unique migrants sent by a household” and “total number of migration episodes
generated by a household”. The effect size for “number of migrants” is very similar to that of “any
migrant”, which indicates that the treatment mostly had an extensive margin effect (inducing nonmigrant households to send a migrant), and not much of an effect on the intensive margin (inducing
migrant households to send an additional migrant). We offered to subsidize only one trip per
household. The effect size for migration episodes is 1.6 times as large as the ‘any migrant’ effect,
which indicates that the induced migrants migrate for multiple episodes during the season.
The fourth column uses data from the follow-up survey conducted a year later, which
enquires about longer-run migration decisions during the next lean season (2015-16) for which
migration incentives were no longer provided. We see persistent effects: households that received
subsidy offers a year before along with many of their village co-residents (in the high-intensity
treatment) were 29 percentage points more likely to re-migrate a year later. Households that received
offers the previous year along with few of their village co-residents (i.e., low-intensity treatment)
11 Bryan et al. (2014)’s simpler design only reports results comparable to our low-intensity treatment. In low-intensity
villages, we make offers of grants to 18 households per village on average, which is comparable to their 19 offers per
village in Bryan et al. (2014). They report a 24 percentage point increase in migration rates, comparable to the 24.8
percentage points here.
12 In Appendix Table A.2, we examine whether these results are sensitive to controlling for previous rounds of
intervention activity in these villages in 2008, 2011 or 2013. Our results are remarkably stable regardless of how we
control for these prior activities. This is not surprising, given that those treated in 2014 and the subject of this paper, are
different households than those treated earlier. We control for both individual level and village level treatments, and our
results are unaffected.

16

were 19 percentage points more likely to re-migrate relative to the control group. The reactions in
the two types of villages are significantly different from each other (p-value<0.01). In both cases, the
effect size is about 75% as large as the original migration effect in 2014-15, which suggests that
about 75% of the offered migrant households chose to re-migrate on their own volition the
following year. Unlucky households not offered grants in the high-intensity treatment villages the
year before demonstrated very strong persistence: they were 13 percentage points more likely to remigrate in 2015-16 relative to the control group.
5.1.1 Sources of Migration Spillovers
We use two additional pieces of data to explore the source of these spillovers. First, prior to
treatment assignment, we collected data on social network relationships between sample households,
starting with a simple question on whether they know the other people in the sample. 13 In column 1
of Table 2, we employ this question to examine migration decisions, while separating each treatment
group into households that know another sample household that received the randomized offer, and
those that do not. This creates a total of 8 cells: [High/Low Intensity]x[Not Offered/ Offered]x
[Knows/Does not Know]. We control for the fraction of people that the respondent knows, in
order to hold constant how social the respondent is, and use only variation in whether they happen
to know another person who got lucky and received a migration subsidy. We find that if the
household received an offer itself, then its migration propensity was equally high regardless of
whether it knew another household that received an offer. However, if the household got unlucky
and did not get an offer, then it only migrated if it knew another household that received an offer. In
other words, the spillover effect is only present if the household knows others with offers.
The second column uses richer variation from the social network relationship data, where we
asked each household to identify the subset of other households it could rely on in times of need.
The spillover effect on the household’s migration is much stronger if another household with which
it has a strong connection (“can be relied on”) gets lucky and receives an offer. These results are
suggestive of a conscious, coordinated process by which the complementarity in migration decisions
arises. If households coordinate more with those it can rely on, then risk may indeed be an
important impediment to migration (Bryan et al. 2014).

These data were collected for a subset of our respondents for an earlier study, and we were able to match 998
households from our endline sample to this earlier dataset with network information. Respondents to this module were
asked whether and to what extent they knew each of 20 (randomly selected) other households from within their village.

13

17

In Table 3, we run a regression that characterizes how our low versus high intensity
treatments affected the propensity to share accommodation costs at the destination or travel with
others. 90% of migrants report traveling with companions, and providing migration subsidies to
many villagers simultaneously (in the high-intensity treatment) significantly increases the number of
travel companions. It has a smaller effect on the number of migrants sharing housing, which again
suggests that risk mitigation rather than sharing costs was the primary motivator. 14
5.1.2 Village Level Migration Rates
These individual level reactions to the migration subsidy offers across “offered” and “nonoffered” households aggregate up to a village level migration response, which essentially serves as a
“first stage” for our general equilibrium analysis. The first stage is likely to be strong, not only
because we made many more offers in the high-intensity treatment, but also because each household
in the high-intensity villages reacted more strongly to the offers.
Table 4 reports the results of the following village-level regression (133 observations) to
examine the proportion of the village population (𝑀𝑀𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 ) induced to move by each of our treatments:
𝑀𝑀𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛿𝛿1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿_𝐼𝐼𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝛿𝛿2 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ_𝐼𝐼𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣

(5.1.2)

35% of eligible (landless poor) households send a seasonal migrant in control villages, and
the high-intensity treatment increases the migration rate in those villages by a further 30 percentage
points to 65%. This represents a sizable labor supply shock. In contrast, the migration rate among
eligibles in the low-intensity villages increases by only 7 percentage points to 42%. 15 We focus on the
population eligible for our subsidies (the landless who face seasonal hunger) for these calculations,
because that group represents the relevant labor market of workers who supply labor on other
people’s farms, or work as day laborers as seasonal migrants. The second column shows effects
relative to the total village population: the high-intensity treatment induces an extra 11.5% of the
population to emigrate from a base of 21% in control villages, which represents a 50% increase in
the emigration rate.

In qualitative interviews, one group of migrants demonstrated real organization to their travel, having designated one
member of the group general caretaker. This caretaker was responsible for some key logistical tasks (such as procuring
and cooking food for the group) and as such was not expected to work at the destination. Rather, the group of migrants
paid him a salary for his role.
15 These village level emigration rates are consistent with the individual level responses reported in Table 1. 70% of
eligible households were offered subsidies in the high intensity villages, and migration propensity estimates for offered
(0.398) and non-offered households (0.097) from table 1 suggests that an extra 30% of the eligible population of the
high intensity villages migrated, which is almost identical to the 30.4% estimate in table 4. The estimate for the low
intensity village also matches closely.
14

18

Since a full village listing was conducted in only 117 of the 133 sample villages, our data on
the denominators for the other 16 villages (the total and landless population) used in these
regressions are based on a knowledgeable villager’s estimates, and therefore imperfect. Columns 3
and 4 restrict the sample to the 117 villages with high-quality information, and the results remain
strong (the high-intensity treatment induces an extra 28% of the landless population, or 15% of the
total population to emigrate). To be careful, our subsequent analysis reports the important second
stage estimates for both the full (133 village) and partial (117 village) samples.
Finally, we examine the 2015-16 re-migration rate at the village level in column 5, a year after
the incentives were removed. The high-intensity treatment continues to induce an extra 20% of the
landless population to re-migrate. The corresponding figure for the low-intensity treatment is 5.6%.
5.1.3 Summary of Effects on Migration
To summarize, people react more positively to the exact same migration subsidy offer when
a larger number of their village co-residents receive the offer at the same time. This enhanced
propensity to migrate even extends to other village residents who did not receive an offer
themselves. Our data suggest that people coordinate their migration plans: these spillovers are
stronger amongst people who know, or can rely on, an offer recipient. The high intensity offers
increased the number of migrants sharing housing by a little and the number of travel companions
by a lot. All of these factors combined to produce a much stronger labor supply shock to the village
labor market under the high-intensity treatment, which we exploit to study the downstream effects
on income, wages and employment conditions. 16
5.2 Income, Labor Supply and Wages
Our endline survey collected data on all sources of income (including migration income)
over a 5-month recall period covering the entire main Aman rice growing season (including the preharvest lean period). Each round of the high frequency labor surveys focused only on labor income
over a 7-10 day recall period, and conducted a deeper dive into hours of labor supplied and daily
earnings inside and outside the village, broken down by all working household members. The labor

16 Our research design assumes that villages are closed labor markets, because traveling to supply labor to other nearby
villages that are also growing rice and also facing a lean season at the same time is uncommon. Of special concern to our
research design would be the possibility that our treatments induce travel from control and low-intensity into highintensity villages. We use GPS coordinates of all treatment villages to verify that out-migration rates are no different
from villages that are physically close to other treatment villages. A regression of migration rate on distance to the
nearest treatment village (in km) has a coefficient of +0.004 and standard error of 0.03.

19

surveys were repeated 6 times, covering 8 weeks total. We now report the effects of our treatment
on income, starting with all sources of household income gathered from the endline survey.
Table 5 reports ITT estimates. Those offered grants in either high or low intensity villages
experience large and significant gains in migration income. The migration rates in these two cells
were different (Table 1), so the larger income estimate for the high-intensity villages (4,815
compared to 3,516) does not necessarily imply that migrants from those villages were more
successful. Columns (2) and (3) show that inducing migration amongst these households reduced
their non-migration income for the 5-month recall period. Columns (4) and (5) show that even after
accounting for that displacement, net income increased significantly (by about 9-19% of the control
group mean) in the ITT when households were offered a migration transfer.
Column 6 shows that this extra income led to virtually no change in savings. This is
consistent with results from earlier rounds of investigation (Bryan et al. 2014) that document that
this is a sample of extremely poor people who consume any extra income earned during the lean
season. Finally, column 7 shows that the re-migration a year after the interventions led to persistent
gains in income. The larger gains observed a year later is also consistent with results in Bryan et al.
(2014), and could be partly due to selection on successful migrants who choose to re-migrate.
5.2.1 Differences between High and Low Intensity Villages
ITT estimates report average effects combining migrants and non-migrants, and are
therefore not useful for determining whether the migration experience of those traveling from highintensity village is more successful than that of migrants from low-intensity villages. The highintensity treatment may allow more friends to travel together and create other benefits, but on the
other hand, it may draw in more marginal migrants who do not possess as strong a comparative
advantage in the city. To explore these tradeoffs, we run an IV specification, where the decision to
migrate from each type of village is instrumented with assignment to treatment:
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛾𝛾1 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾2 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(5.2.1)

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is an indicator for any member of the household

migrating at any point during the lean season from a low (high) intensity village, and 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is

migration income. We instrument the migration decisions with the randomized treatment variables,
{Offer_HI, NonOffer_HI, Offer_LI, NonOffer_LI} from equation (5.1.1), or simply the village
level treatments {Low_I, High_I} from equation (5.1.2). The bottom rows of Table 6 show that the

20

first-stage fits are quite strong, regardless of which set of instruments is used (F-stat on excluded
instruments of 305 or 165).
Column 1 of Table 6 shows that migrants traveling from high-intensity villages earn an extra
6,173 Taka (US$80 at BDT 77 = $1) at the destination, while migrants from the low-intensity
villages earn an extra 4,672 Taka ($61), both large relative to the 1,000 Taka ($13) conditional grant
to subsidize migrants’ travel costs. The difference between the two numbers is not statistically
significant (p=0.18). The point estimate indicates that additional benefits associated with traveling
with more companions is larger than the negative selection effects, but the net effect is not
significant.
Table 7 uses the high frequency labor surveys to delve into how the experiences of migrants
from the control, low-intensity and high-intensity villages differ. The primary workers in households
from high-intensity villages who migrate have an easier time finding work: they are employed 5.9
(out of 7) days during the weeks when they migrate, compared to 5.7 days for workers from lowintensity villages (p-value of difference = 0.46) and 5.3 days (p-value = 0.08) for control village
migrants (column 1). High-intensity village migrants are entirely unemployed in the city 1.6% of the
time, compared to 4.6% for low-intensity (p-value=0.18) and 6.5% (p-value = 0.06) for control
village migrants (column 12). Consequently, migrants from the high-intensity villages earn more.
Table 7 also makes clear how labor market conditions between the villages of origin and
migration destinations differ. In contrast to the 1.6-6.5% unemployment rate in the city, primary
workers in our sample remain unemployed about 50% of the time during the weeks when they are
back in their village of origin. 17 The situation is better in high-intensity villages (39% unemployment,
compared to 53% in low-intensity and 58% in control villages in column 14), which likely has to do
with many competing workers being away that week, which is a topic that we’ll return to when
discussing general equilibrium effects. On average across the entire sample, people are able to work
3.9-4.3 days per week in the village, compared to the 5.3-5.9 days per week in the city. The income
differences we observe are therefore at least partly due to differences in work availability.
5.2.2 Further Insights on Income Sources from High Frequency Labor Surveys
The high frequency surveys asked about the details of labor market participation for all
household members over a weekly recall, which allows us to provide richer detail on income earned
by the household at migration destinations, income earned in the village, as well as hours worked

17

This compares migrants to those who choose to stay in the village, and is therefore partly driven by selection.

21

and daily income separately for each location. While the endline survey allows us to capture income
aggregated over 5 months, with the high-frequency we can delve into exactly what was happening in
the village labor markets week-to-week during the exact period that many migrants were moving
back and forth between the village and the city. Table 8 provides ITT estimates. For completeness,
Panel A shows full sample results and Panel B omits the 16 villages where we do not have an exact
measure of village population (which will affect the precision of IV estimates in subsequent tables).
Offering a migration subsidy increases income by 1,263-1,401 Taka during that eight week
period 18, and income earned at destinations (1,000-1,100 Taka) accounts for roughly 80% of the
overall gain. The treatment increased both the number of work days (+4.8, of which +4.4 is work
away from the village), and income earned per day, and these two channels combine to produce the
overall income gain. The ITT estimates for the low-intensity villages are smaller, probably because
the gains we observe clearly come from households that access labor markets outside the village, and
the migration take-up rate is a lot lower in the low-intensity villages.
There are two other noteworthy results in Table 8 that require further investigation. First,
offering a subsidy to migrate increases income earned in the home village (by ~200 Taka, but
statistically insignificant change), and the households’ work days at home by about a day compared
to the control group. This implies that increases in income earned outside the village during the 8
week heavy migration period did not simply displace income that would have otherwise been earned
in the village. Further, the direction of these effects is somewhat surprising, even though it is not
statistically significant, because we induced the main income earner to leave home and go work
outside the village. That the household continues to earn more at home even when the primary
worker is not present (while also earning more at migration destinations) may indicate some changes
in the village labor market, or intra-household changes in labor supply, and we need to understand
this better.
Second, households residing in the high intensity villages but who were never treated or
directly contacted in any way by our implementation partners, experience an increase in their income
(419 Taka in the full sample and 619 Taka (p-val<0.1) in the 117 village sample). This is a summary
We have provided estimates of the effect of our treatment on income from two separate sources: the endline and the
high frequency survey. The effect sizes are quite comparable. The ITT estimate for migration income gain from offers
in high intensity villages is 4,815 taka (over 22 week recall period or about 218 taka per week), and 3,231 Taka (147 per
week) for all labor market income. The corresponding estimates from the high frequency survey is 1,263 taka for labor
market income (over 6 weekly recall periods or about 210 taka per week), and 1,049 Taka (175 per week) earned away
from the village. There is also quantitative consistency across years and studies: Our LATE estimates of extra income
accruing to migrant families are large enough to produce the consumption and calorie gains reported in Bryan et al.
(2014).

measure of the general equilibrium effect that is inclusive of all forms of spillovers, which may
include: (a) increasing the migration propensity of the non-offered, (b) changing their outcomes at
destination, or (c) changing labor market conditions at the origin. We will try to shed light on each
of these potential channels. 19
5.2.3 Why did Income Earned in the Village Increase?
We first establish the magnitude of the increase in income by running a LATE version of the
ITT estimates presented in the previous table. In this smaller high frequency survey sample, we have
first-stage precision only when instrumenting the household’s decision to send a migrant with
assignment to the high-intensity treatment. Table 9 shows that induced migrants earn an extra 9,135
Taka ($119), and again, about 80% is derived from income earned outside the village, while the other
20% is attributable to an increase in home income. Migration allowed the household to work an
extra 34 person-days, most of it outside the village. This reflects the stark difference in
unemployment rates between the village and the city during the lean season: Table 7 shows that it’s
much easier to find work in the city. The last column provides the first clue as to why income earned
inside the village increases for migrant households. Daily income at home, which is calculated as
income per day of work, increases for those induced to migrate. This suggests that wages and
employment conditions changed in high- intensity villages.
Table 10 reports the equilibrium effects of our village-level treatments on wages paid, using
data from our survey of employers. In this regression, we use village-level assignment to highintensity treatment to instrument for the fraction of households induced to send a seasonal migrant
(see Table 4), and then study the effects on wages reported by employers in a second stage:
𝑊𝑊𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝜇𝜇 ∙ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 + 𝜑𝜑𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒

(5.2.3)

This is an employer-level regression, where W can be either agricultural or non-agricultural
wages reported by employers. We have a relatively small number of employers reporting wages in
each category (385 or 276), which is why we focus only high-intensity villages where we have a much
stronger first stage. The smaller increase in emigration rate in the low-intensity villages creates a
weak instrument in the employer sample. We collected data on wages by gender, but focus on the
wage rate for males because very few employers reported hiring females, and almost all migrants
were male. The village-level “Migration_Rate” is defined as (Households with Migrants/Landless
To do so, we will need to make use of the details in the high-frequency data on who within the household leaves and
who stays at home during the critical migration period, and where and what do they earn. The fact that our treatment
changed the migration propensity of the untreated (as documented in Table 1) implies that “non-offered” households
cannot act as a clean sample that helps us experimentally isolate labor market conditions in the village.

19

23

households). We show results for both the full sample, and the subsample omitting the 17 villages
without precise data on the landless population in the village.
More out-migration causes the agricultural wage rate in the village to increase, but has no
detectable effect on the non-agricultural wage rate. For every extra 10% of the landless population
that emigrates, wages increase by 2.2% (p<0.05; column 3) in the 117 village sample, or 1.5% in the
full sample (p<0.1). Our high-intensity treatment induced an extra 30% of the population to
emigrate on average, and the agricultural wages are therefore predicted to increase by about 4.56.6%. As a benchmark, the LATE increase in “income earned in origin village” amongst migrant
households was 1,787 Taka in Table 9, which is a 40% increase relative to the control group. Only a
sixth of this increase is therefore attributable to the increase in the wage rate. There must have also
been an increase in hours worked at home, which we investigate next.
5.2.4 Household Labor Supply at Origin
To explain the increase in labor supply and income at home in migrant households, the first
natural candidate to consider is an increase in labor supply amongst other household members when
the migrant is away. With many primary earners migrating away from the high-intensity villages, the
spouses and adult children of the primary working age males may have an easier time finding work,
and choose to expand their labor supply in response to the increased agricultural wages.
Our survey instrument collected labor supply and income separately for every working
member of the households, and it also clearly identified the one primary earner for each household
(who is often the migrant). Table 11 examines intra-household shifts in labor supply by studying
income, work days and daily earnings for all household members other than the primary worker.
Surprisingly, there is no increase in work days or income in this sub-population across treatment
arms. The point estimates are quite small (e.g. days worked changes by -0.17 days), and not
statistically distinguishable from zero. Evidently, migration does not induce any intra-household
substitution in labor, and other members are not responsible for the increase in in-village income
that we have documented.
So the remaining possibility is that the primary worker boosts participation in the labor
markets within high-intensity villages. Since this person is also induced to migrate by our treatment,
the story would have to be that the primary earner goes back-and-forth between origin and
destination, and, during periods when a larger number of competing workers are away during any
given week in high-intensity villages, he supplies labor to the origin labor market during the week
when he is back, taking advantage of slack (and the higher agricultural wages) there.
24

Before conducting a formal test of this mechanism, Table 12 presents a series of descriptive
statistics which show that a number of the conditions that are necessary for these gains to occur are
actually present in the data. First, panel A shows that the primary worker is not only contributing
the bulk of income earned away from the village (as a migrant), but he is also responsible for the
majority of income earned inside the village. Across all treatment arms, he contributes about 80% of
household income and days worked at home. Panel B sheds light on how this is possible: the highfrequency re-visits show us that the primary worker migrates over multiple episodes (averaging 1.55
episodes per migrant) and therefore moves back-and-forth between the village and the city. On
average, he spends a third of his time away from the village.
Finally, primary workers in high-intensity villages can only take advantage of periods of slack
in the village labor market if not all migrants leave the village and return to the village
simultaneously. To explore whether this is the case, panel C uses the high -frequency data to
calculate the probability that a randomly -sampled “ever-migrant” (i.e. someone who has migrated
during the period of enquiry) is at home during a week that another randomly -sampled ever-migrant
from his village is away migrating. We see that this probability is quite high—about 75%—across all
treatment arms. This implies that not all migrants from a village travel and return together at the
same time: some might travel for weeks 1-3, others weeks 4-6, and yet others traveling back-andforth (e.g. week 2 plus 5-6). Whenever a migrant returns home to a high-intensity village, many of
his competitors are away (owing to the high intensity of the treatment), and this could make it easier
for him to find work and take advantage of the improved agricultural wages.
The statistics presented earlier in Table 7 already indicate that this is a plausible explanation.
We had used the individual-level and weekly variation afforded by our high frequency surveys to
compare the labor market performance of primary workers during the weeks they spend back at the
village of origin. The sub-sample of ever-migrants find work 3.5 days of the week when they return
to control villages, 3.6 in low-intensity, and 4.3 days in high-intensity treatment villages (Table 7,
column 3). The difference between high-intensity and control villages is statistically significant (pvalue<0.01, with errors clustered by village). In the full sample of households (col. 2), there are 3.9
days of work in control villages, 4.1 in low-intensity and 4.3 in high-intensity (p-val=0.02). Primary
workers in high-intensity villages are also less likely to be entirely unemployed during weeks when
they are home (Table 7, col. 14: 38% versus 53% in low-intensity and 58% in control; p-value=0.09).
They also report greater weekly earnings at home (cols. 8 or 9: 825 Taka versus 680 Taka in lowintensity and 615 in control; p-value<0.001).
25

The data therefore provide some clear indication of greater labor market slack in the villages
of origin, as the saturation of the migration subsidy treatment (and correspondingly, the emigration
rate from those villages) was increased. We test this hypothesis in Table 13 using the individual-level
and weekly variation recorded in the six rounds of the high frequency labor market surveys. During
the weeks when they are at home, primary workers earn 60 Taka more in low-intensity villages than
in control, and primary workers in high-intensity villages earn 88 Taka more. This test uses the
sample of all primary workers, not only those who chose to migrate. These benefits are accruing to
all residents of high-intensity villages.
However, column 10 in Table 7 shows that this result is a little complicated to interpret.
Naturally, primary workers in high-intensity villages spend more weeks away from the village (1.4)
than workers in control villages (0.8), because our treatment induced migration. Cross-village
comparisons of “income earned in the village” are therefore complicated, because migrants may
choose to come back to the high-intensity village during the select weeks when it is most profitable
to do so. That may lead to some “selection on timing” that drives the home-income difference in
Table 13.
To address this concern, we identify the “best week” to be at home in each of the villages,
defined as the week when the household earned the highest income in their home village. We then
conduct a “best week to best week” comparison across control, low-intensity and high-intensity
villages in Table 14. This now uses only one-sixth of our data (because we only pick one week – the
best week - of data per household out of six), and the precision of our estimates therefore suffers.
Even in this sub-sample, residents of high-intensity villages earn significantly more (74 Taka,
p<0.10) during a week when they are at home compared to residents of control villages.
5.2.5 Summary of Income, Wage and Labor Supply Effects in the Village of Origin
Migration subsidies significantly increased income in both the low-intensity and highintensity treatment villages. About 80% of the gain was due to income earned away from the village,
where it is much easier to find work during the lean season. When many workers migrated from the
high-intensity villages, both the rural agricultural wage rate and the amount of work available per
worker increased in those villages. This improved home-earning for those who chose to stay behind,
as well as for migrant families during the weeks when the migrant returned home to take advantage
of the improved labor market conditions. The high intensity treatment produced substantial
spillover benefits for those supplying labor to the village labor market.
26

5.3 Effects on Employers
The higher agricultural wages we documented have to be paid by someone, so we collected
data from both agricultural and non-agricultural employers of those laborers. In 2016, we asked
employers questions about their agricultural yields, revenues, costs, and profits for both the season
during which the migration subsidy program was in effect as well as the season thereafter. We use a
very similar IV specification to the one we used to study the equilibrium effects on the wage rate
(Table 10, equation 5.2.3) to analyze the effects of the village emigration rate (instrumented by the
treatment intensities) on employer revenues, costs and profits.
Consistent with the increase in the agricultural wage rate, agricultural employers report an
increase in the wage bill and also in non-wage costs in the first two columns of Table 15, which
combine to increase total costs in column 3. The variance in costs across employers is high, and
these effects are not statistically significant. In column 4 we control for employer reported costs in
2013 (reported retrospectively), and increase in costs becomes statistically significant (p<0.05). The
next two columns show that revenues decrease, but not significantly. Unlike the cost variable, the
effect on revenues gets smaller and stays insignificant when the dependent variable is defined as
change in revenues pre- to post- intervention. There were no changes in farming practices or
technology apparent in the survey.
The combination of the increase in costs and the slight decrease in revenues leads to a
significant decrease in employer profits, as reported in column 7. Column 8 undermines some
confidence in this profit result, because the result does not stay significant when we difference out
pre-intervention profits from the dependent variable. This suggests some “imbalance” in employers’
retrospective recollection of profits two years prior (in 2013), in that employers in high-intensity
villages report lower profits in 2013, a season before our intervention.
We also collected data on yields for the main (Aman) rice growing season that coincides with
the timing of our intervention. Results are reported in Appendix Table A10. There are no statistically
significant or systematic effects on agricultural yields. The coefficients are positive for yields, but
mixed for the logged specification, or when normalized by land size. In summary, there appears to
be a (negative) pecuniary externality on employers. The large number of laborers leaving the highintensity villages during the lean season creates upward pressure on agricultural wages, which lowers
employer profits. Employers don’t appear to adjust production technology during the two seasons
post disbursement of migration subsidies.
27

5.4 Effects on Food Prices
We collected data on the prices of a basket of important staple foods from shopkeepers
across all villages of origin in our sample. If food markets are not well integrated across villages, the
increase in income from migration transfers could create a demand shock and increase the price of
food, undermining the benefits of the program in real terms. 20 We collected data on all the main
staples and main items sold in village grocery stores that typically double as tea and snack shops.
Table 16 shows results on the effects of emigration on prices item-by-item, and then a Laspeyres
price index. The index was constructed using expenditure shares in a baseline consumption module
from July 2008, before any of these villages were ever treated with migration interventions.
We don’t detect any systematic increase in the prices of the most common staples. There is
absolutely no effect of our intervention on the price of rice (or of flour, daal (lentils), sugar, salt or
milk). Rice accounts for about 70% of the food budget in our sample. However, we see a statistically
significant increase in the price of fish protein. For every 10% increase in emigration, fish price
increases by 1.5% (p<0.1), and meat price by 0.4%. Bryan et al. (2014) had noted that migrant
households increase their consumption of protein, and they also shift towards animal protein. Fish
are also more difficult to transport over longer distances, given the low prevalence of refrigeration.
It is therefore not surprising that the market for fish appears less spatially integrated than the market
for staples like rice and flour.
In contrast, the price of prepared foods (like tea, samosas, and prepared meals), which is an
important non-tradable good, falls. For every 10% increase in emigration, the price of cups of tea
and other beverages sold at the tea shops decreases by 1.5% (p<0.1), and prepared foods by 0.5%.
The male household heads (who are the ones induced to migrate) are typically the individuals who
congregrate at tea shops and consume such prepared food and beverages. When migrants leave the
village, the prices of non-tradables they consume fall.
The net effect of a 10 percentage point increase in emigration is a 0.9% increase in the price
of food, as measured by a Laspeyres index aggregating across all 12 food items. The protein price
increase dominates the non-tradable price decrease because fish constitutes a bigger share of the
household budget than prepared foods and tea. This implies that the 30 percentage point extra
emigration induced in our high-intensity villages increases the cost of food by 2.7%. As noted
earlier, income and work availability more than double for migrant households, and even income

20

Cunha et al. (2014) document such an effect for an in-kind food transfer program in Mexico.

28

earned in the village increases 40%. The small net increase in food price does not cause a
quantitatively meaningful decline in the real value of the income gains we have documented.
5.5 Effects on Food Security during Other Parts of the Year
Finally, to explore the effects of our intervention during the non-lean period, we ask a series
of food security questions in our 2016 follow-up, designed after the Malawi “hungry-season” food
security module used in Beegle et al. (2017). We first compute a summary measure using a survey
question on how often any household member had to cut back on meals or portion sizes. We
average the measure across the lean (monga) season, and the non-lean period (Jan-Aug). Households
in control villages report that they cut down on meals 49% of the time during the lean season and
33% of the time during the non-lean period. Appendix Table A7 shows that with higher emigration
out of the village (instrumented by the randomized treatments), food security significantly improved
during both the lean and non-lean seasons.
Appendix Table A8 explores the precise actions people take to adapt to food shortages.
Increased emigration out of the village reduces the likelihood that village residents have to “worry
about having enough food,” “eat less preferred food”, or “limit their portion size”. Emigration
improves food security in every other dimension (coefficient sizes all point in the same direction in
columns 1-8), but the effects are not always statistically significant. Columns 9 and 10 show that the
migration intervention appears to allow households to take more risky actions to deal with
temporary food insecurity. They feel more comfortable taking loans or selling animals to buy food.

6. Conclusion
Researchers have identified barriers to internal mobility as a key obstacle to development in
many different contexts (Pritchett 2006, Clemens 2011, Brooks and Donovan 2017, Dinkelman et al.
2017). To that, we add rigorous evidence that seasonal migration not only benefits the migrant and
his family, but also indirectly improves welfare in the broader rural economy. Large-scale temporary
emigration creates some slack in the lean-period village labor market and increases available work
hours for landless laborers who are in the village during any given week. It also reduces inequality by
raising rural agricultural wages, which benefits laborers at the expense of richer landowners who hire
them. The concerns expressed by various scholars about the rural economy collapsing, or inequality

29

increasing when migration opportunities are expanded appear to be unfounded, at least in the
context of seasonal migration in rural Bangladesh.
Our results call into question the wisdom of instituting mobility restrictions on behalf of
rural development goals. Many municipal governments in developing countries have reacted to
increased rural-urban migration as if it were an invasion to repel (Simmons, 1981: p. 89), with direct
controls such as permits required for transport, settlement or accepting urban employment (Oberai,
1983). 21 China and Indonesia have experimented with rural re-settlement schemes, moving people
away from densely populated areas (Bazzi et al. 2016). China’s Hukou system, which restricts
freedom of movement, is the most important contemporary example of mobility restrictions.
Some policymakers pursue development strategies that emphasize rural development
(including a suite of rural support programs in Bangladesh such as Vulnerable Group Development, Food
for Asset Creation, and Rural Maintenance Program) and employment creation (such as India’s NREGA),
while others advocate for improved connectivity between regions so that citizens can take advantage
of spatial gaps in wages (Morten and Oliveira 2017; Bryan and Morten 2017). Our results are
informative about the relative effectiveness of these alternative strategies. These two broad
approaches often act as substitutes: Rural employment guarantee schemes prevents out-migration
(Imbert and Papp 2017) by improving rural wages (Imbert and Papp 2015).
The seasonal migration support program we devised straddles these two policy poles by
enhancing connectivity without large investments in infrastructure. With the low disbursement cost
and its persistent effects, the program we test is at least 5 times as cost effective in improving food
security as four major food-for-work and cash transfer programs in Bangladesh evaluated by IFPRI
(Ahmed et al 2009). This paper focused on understanding changes to the village labor market as
people emigrate, but seasonal migration may also change the nature and extent of informal risk
sharing (which we explore in Meghir et al 2017). To provide a more comprehensive evaluation as
this program is scaled up further, future research will explore non-economic effects in the social,
health and political realms, and market spillovers on the destination urban economies.

21 In Jakarta in 1970, migrants were required to register and deposit their return fare. This was true also of forced slum
clearance in Delhi during the emergency declared by Indira Gandhi. South Africa has restricted movement of its black
population. China has required removal certificates from place of origin and documentation of job offers, and has
enforced forced rustication.

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results in this table were generated using
household level data from the endline survey.
The dependent variable in specification (1) is an indicator for whether the household had at least one migrant over the period September
15 2014 - April 30 2015. The dependent variable in specification (2) is the total number of unique migrants sent by the household over
this period. The dependent variable in specification (3) is the total number of migration episodes (i.e. the total number of trips taken by all
migrant members of a household) over this period. The dependent variable in specificaiton (4) is re-migration a year later (September 1
2015 - May 31 2016). No further incentives were provided that year, but we collected data to study longer term responses.
All specifications include Upazila fixed effects (an Upazila is an administrative unit that encompasses groups of villages in the sample;
there are a total of 14 Upazilas across our sample of villages). Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st
percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above the 99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile value)

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results in this table were generated using a combination
of network data from 2013 and migration and treatment data from the 2014 endline survey. Estimations are at the household level.
The network data was generated by asking subject households to answer questions about each of 20 randomly selected households from the
same village, including: whether the respondent household knows them at all; whether it knows them well; and whether it can rely upon them.
The dependent variable in all specifications is the probability that the respondent household had any member who migrated in 2014. The results
shown are average marginal effects on a probit regression. Thus the coefficients represent the change in the probability that a household will
have a migrant based on the treatment arm and connection to other households.
Specification (1) measures household connectivity as a binary distinction: whether the respondent knows another household with/without offer.
Specification (2) subdivides connectivity into three categories: (a) whether the respondent "can rely on" on another household with/without
offer, (b) whether it "knows" another household but cannot rely on it, or (c) that it does not know another household with/without offer at all.
The independent variables intersect the network data with the treatment data, thus placing households in groups according to two criteria:
whether they themselves were offered a subsidy to migrate, and whether they know households that were offered a subsidy. Thus, for instance,
"Offered Grant in Low Intensity Treatment Village and Connected to Someone Offered" refers to a household in a low intensity village that
was made a migration grant offer and knows another household with someone who was also offered a grant.
All specifications include Upazila fixed effects.

Standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results were generated using a combination of the 2015 endline survey and the 2015 employer survey.
The dependent variable in specification (1) is the proportion of landless households eligible for a subsidy in each village that migrated at any point over the period September 15, 2014 - April 30, 2015.
The number of eligible households in a village (the denominator) computed based on census data collected in 2008. The formula we used to compute the fractions accounts for the fact that differing
fractions of offered and non-offered households were sampled, and we know the sampling probabilities. Specification (2) changes the denominator to "number of total households in the village" also
reported in the census data. 6 villages drop when we use this dependent variable (133->127 and 117->111). Specifications (3)-(4) are identical to (1)-(2), but with the sample limited to villages where we
have the highest quality listing data on numbers of total and eligible landless households in the village (which are the denominators of the dependent variables). Specification (5) measures re-migration,
i.e. migration from 2015-2016, and also limits the sample to villages where we have the highest quality listing data on numbers of total and eligible landless households in the village.
All specifications are at the village level. All specifications include Upazila fixed effects.

The dependent variable in specification (1) is gross income from migration that migrants generated during the period September 15 2014 - February 15 2015; (2) is income earned at home (defined as the sum of income from the household's
enterprises and off-farm wages) minus the household's costs in the income-generating activities; (4) is income earned at home from wages on others' farms or businesses; (5) is the sum of (1) and (3); (6) is the sum of (1) and (4); (6) is savings
reported by the household, accruing over the same period (Sept 2014-Feb 2015); and (7) is migration income from re-migration in 2015-2016.
All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above the 99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile

The dependent variable in both specifications (1)-(2) is gross income from migration that migrants
generated during the period September 15 2014 - April 30 2015.
The dependent variable is regressed on two indicators for migrants from low and high intensity
villages, respectively. These variables are instrumented in a 2SLS regression using assignment to

The results in this table were generated using household level data from the high frequency survey which interviewed households 6 times between 22nd December 2014 to 28th February 2015.
Dependent variables marked "away" average only across those periods in which the primary worker was away, and similarly for "home".
Columns marked "Full Sample" compute averages of the dependent variables for all households in the sample. Columns marked "Migrant HHs only sample" restrict the analysis to households in which a household member migrated at some point in the survey period.
Dependent variables, all averaged across households in the sample: Columns (1)-(3) measure average days worked per household by the primary worker divided by the number of periods in the survey; (4)-(6) measure total income earned by the primary worker; (7)-(9) are
similar to (4)-(6) but normalize by number of periods; (10)-(11) measure the total number of periods the primary worker was away or home (respectively) over the survey range; (12)-(14) measure the number of periods in which the primary worker was away or home
(respectively) and reported not working during that period.

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results in this table were generated using household level data from the high frequency survey which interviewed households 6 times
between 22nd December 2014 to 28th February 2015.
The dependent variable in specification (1) is total income (in takas) generated by the household i.e. income generated from participation in the origin and the away (i.e. migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high
frequency survey. The dependent variables in specifications (2) and (3) are income (in takas) generated by the household from participation only in the origin labor market and income (in takas) generated by the household from
participation only in the away (i.e. migrant) labor market respectively for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (4) is the total number of days that working members of the
household participated in the origin and the away (i.e. migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variables in specifications (5) and (6) are number of days that working members
of the household participated only in the origin labor market and only in the away (i.e. migrant) labor market respectively, for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (7) is the
average daily wage rate across home and away labor markets, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the surveyed household for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable
in specification (8) is the average daily wage rate in the home labor market, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the surveyed household for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The
dependent variable in specification (9) is the average daily wage rate in the away labor market, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the surveyed household for the period covered by the high frequency
survey.
Daily Income can be computed only for households that have positive number of days worked at that location.
All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above the 99th percentile were set to the 99th
percentile value)

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results in this table show a set of IV specifications that were generated using household level data from the high frequency survey which interviewed
households 6 times between 22nd December 2014 to 28th February 2015. The data across six rounds of surveys are pooled.
The dependent variable in specification (1) is total income (in takas) generated by the household i.e. income generated from participation in the origin and the away (i.e. migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high frequency survey.
The dependent variables in specifications (2) and (3) are income (in takas) generated by the household from participation only in the origin labor market and income (in takas) generated by the household from participation only in the away (i.e.
migrant) labor market respectively for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (4) is the total number of days that working members of the household participated in the origin and the away (i.e.
migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variables in specifications (5) and (6) are number of days that working members of the household participated only in the origin labor market and only in
the away (i.e. migrant) labor market respectively, for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (7) is the average daily wage rate across home and away labor markets, computed based on the reported
income and days worked by the surveyed household for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (8) is the average daily wage rate in the home labor market, computed based on the reported income
and days worked by the surveyed household for the period covered by the high frequency survey.
"Migrated", the RHS variable is binary, and =1 if at least one member of household migrated during the entire period covered by High Frequency Labor Surveys. This variable is instrumented in a 2SLS regression using assignment to treatment
(High and Low Intensity, Offered and Non-offered). All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above the
99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile value)

Standard errors clustered at the village level reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Uses data from the employer survey which interviewed agricultural and nonagricultural employers across all villages in the sample, and asked about wages paid during the period of out-migration. The survey asked separately about male and female wages, and about
agricultural and non-agricultural wages.
The dependent variable is regressed on the proportion of the eligible population that migrated in each village. This was constructed as a ratio of total migrant households in a village and
total eligible households in a village. The number of eligible households was available based on previous census data. The total number of migrants was constructed using the same data
and formulas used in Table 1. The independent variable was intrumented with village level assignment to the high intensity treatment.
Columns (1)-(4) restrict the sample to the 117 villages where we have the highest quality listing data on numbers of total and eligible landless households in the village. Columns (5)-(6) use
the full, unrestricted sample.

Dependent variables are average wages paid by employers for: (1) males in agricultural work; (2) males in non-agricultural work; (3)-(4) identical to (1)-(2) but using log wages; (5)-(6)
identical to (3)-(4) but with full sample (see above).
Wage variables presented in this table do not include the value of food transferred by employers. Employers sometimes compensate workers with food along with money wage. We present
results for wage without food because that was more consistently reported.

All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above
the 99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile value)

generated by non-primary working members from participation only in the away (i.e. migrant) labor market respectively for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (4) is the total number of days that
non-primary working members of the household participated in the origin and the away (i.e. migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variables in specifications (5) and (6) are number of days that
non-primary working members of the household participated only in the origin labor market and only in the away (i.e. migrant) labor market respectively, for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (7)
is the average daily wage rate across home and away labor markets, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the non-primary working members for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in
specification (8) is the average daily wage rate in the home labor market, while in specification (9) it is the average daily wage rate in the away labor market, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the non-primary working

The results in this table were generated using household level data from the high frequency survey which interviewed households 6 times between 22nd December 2014 to
28th February 2015.
Panel A describes the proportion of each dependent variable generated by the primary worker of the household. The dependent variables are as follows:
(1) Total income (in takas) i.e. income generated from participation in the origin and the away (i.e. migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high frequency
survey. (2) and (3) Income (in takas) generated from participation only in the origin labor market and income (in takas) generated from participation only in the away (i.e.
migrant) labor market respectively for the period covered by the high frequency survey. (4) Total number of days that members of the household participated in the origin and
the away (i.e. migrant) labor markets for the period covered by the high frequency survey. (5) and (6) Number of days that members of the household participated only in the
origin labor market and only in the away (i.e. migrant) labor market respectively, for the period covered by the high frequency survey. (7) Average daily wage rate across home
and away labor markets, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the household members for the period covered by the high frequency survey. (8) and
(9) Average daily wage rate in the home labor market and the away labor market respectively, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the household
members for the period covered by the high frequency survey.
Panel B measures, for each of the three treatment arms:
(a) The average proportion of the time covered by the survey in which a household member was away on a migration. To accomplish this, the survey range was divided into
31 periods, and each period was marked "1" if a household member was on migration and "0" otherwise. The proportion is the average of that variable for each household,
restricted to households that had a migrant at some point in the survey range.
(b) The average number of migration episodes by any member of the household during the survey range, again restricted to households that had a migrant at some point in
the survey range.
Panel C presents the probability that, for a given household in a given round of the interview with no members away, at least one other household within their village has a
member away (i.e. a member who is migrant). This is generated by running 1,000 simulations in which two random households in an arbitrarily chosen village are chosen and
checked to see whether one has a migrant while the other does not. The probability is the number of times this occurred divided by 1,000.

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results in this table were generated using household level data from the high
frequency survey which interviewed households 6 times between 22nd December 2014 to 28th February 2015. The sample is restricted to the contributions of the
primary working member of each household, and the analysis includes only periods in which the primary worker is home (i.e. was not on migration in that period).
The dependent variable in specification (1) is total income (in takas) per period generated by the primary working member from participation in the origin labor market
for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (2) is the total number of days that the primary working member of the
household participated in the origin labor market for the period covered by the high frequency survey. The dependent variable in specification (3) is the average daily
wage rate in the home labor markets, computed based on the reported income and days worked by the primary working members for the period covered by the high
frequency survey.
All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st percentile were set to the 1st percentile value
and values above the 99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile value)

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The IV results in these tables were generated with the 2016 Follow-up Employer Survey, combined with 2015 migration rates per
village derived from the 2016 Follow-up Household Survey. Analysis is conducted at the village level. All money-related variables are measured in taka.
The dependent variable in specificaiton (1) is wage per decimal (land unit) paid by the employer in 2015 (including labor costs of land preparation, sowing, maintenance and harvesting). The dependent variable in
specification (2) encompasses costs per decimal incurred by the employer non-wage costs. Dependent variables in specifications (3)-(4) are all measures of costs per decimal (land unit) paid by the employer: column
(3) has cost per decimal for 2015 and column (4) has the change in costs per decimal from 2013 to 2015. Columns (5)-(6) use the same specifications, but applied to revenues earned by the employer. Columns (7)-(8)
also have the same specifications, but applied to profits earned by the employer (revenues minus costs).
The dependent variable is regressed on a binary variable "Migrated" that takes on the value 1 if at least one member of household migrated during the relevant period and zero otherwise. This variable was
instrumented in a 2SLS regression using assignment to low-intensity or high-intensity treatment (as indicated). All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level
(values below the 1st percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above the 99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile value)

Appendix 1: Effects of the Experiment on the Equilibrium Wage Rate in the Origin Village
Suppose each landless household who has not migrated out has a Cobb-Douglas utility function,
(4.2.1)
𝑈𝑈 = 𝐿𝐿𝛼𝛼 𝐶𝐶 1−𝛼𝛼
Where 𝐶𝐶 denotes consumption goods measured in taka and 𝐿𝐿 are hours of leisure. 𝐶𝐶 is
given by 𝐶𝐶 = 𝑤𝑤ℎ + 𝑉𝑉, where ℎ is labor hours supplied within the village, 𝑤𝑤 is wage in the village
and 𝑉𝑉 is outside income including income from migration. The time constraint function is given by
1 − ℎ = 𝐿𝐿
The household maximizes expected utility subject to the budget and time constraint,

(4.2.3)
The first order condition: ℎ = 1 − 𝛼𝛼 − 𝑤𝑤
The labor supply function in this simple setting derived above depends on village wage, w,

(TW) that workers are willing to supply is,
𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼

Assume that the profit function for the landed farmers in the village is given by,
(4.2.5)
𝜋𝜋 = 𝑙𝑙 𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘 (1−𝛽𝛽) − 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 − 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
where 𝑙𝑙 is hired labor, 𝑤𝑤 is the prevailing village wage, 𝑘𝑘 are other inputs, and 𝑟𝑟 is the (rental) price
of those inputs. The labor demand of a landed farmer in the village can be expressed as,

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The results in this table use household level data from the 2014-15 endline survey. The dependent variable is gross income from migration that migrants generated during the period September 15 2014 - April
30 2015. There are a few massive outliers in reported income, and all columns therefore trim out the extreme 1% of values for the dependent variable (top and bottom). All specifications include Upazila fixed effects. Dependent variables were winsorized at the 98% level (values below the 1st
percentile were set to the 1st percentile value and values above the 99th percentile were set to the 99th percentile value)

Errors clustered at the village level in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
The results in this table show a set of IV specifications that were generated using data from the 2016 follow-up survey. The independent variable
throughout is the village-level share of eligible villagers who migrated in 2015-2016, instrumented by treatment assignment to high- or low-intensity
villages (two excluded dummy variables).
Food insecurity is measured as follows. For every given month from mid-August 2015 to midAugust 2016, each household was asked how many days
in that month any member of that household had to cut down on meal portions or number of meals in a day: rarely (0-5 days) or more than that (6
days to the whole month). In our data, rarely is marked as "0" and more than that as "1". This gives a household-level measure of food insecurity per
month, where a higher score (from 0 to 1) represents more food insecurity (i.e. more hunger). For these tables, the monthly numbers were averaged
across the lean months (mid-August 2015-mid-January 2016) and nonlean months (mid-January 2016 to mid-August 2016), giving a measure of food
insecurity in each household across these periods. Columns (1), (3) and (5) represent the lean month averages while (2), (4) and (6) represent the
nonlean averages. Columns (1) and (2) use the full sample of villages, columns (3) and (4) use the partial sample, where data on village population is of
higher quality, and columns (5) and (6) use the compact sample,
which is the subset of villages for which we have the most consistent and precise data.
All specifications include Upazila fixed effects.

Appendix Figure A1: Seasonality in Rangpur, where our sample villages are located

Figure reproduced from Bryan et al (2014). Households spend less money overall but spend more on food during the lean season in the last three months of the year. In
addition, the figures illustrate that this increased expenditure is due to a rise in the price of rice (rather than a rise in quantity), and that quantity of rice consumed in fact falls.

Appendix Figure A2: Seasonality in the Farm Sector

Figures reproduced from Khandker and Mahmud (2012). The author use data from a large survey conducted by the Institute of Microfinance survey in 2008 to
show that days of labor supplied (wage employment) fall in the farm-sector during the lean season called ‘monga’ (left panel), while they stay relatively constant
throughout the year in the nonfarm- sector (right panel).
