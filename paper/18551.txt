Information and College Access: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment

NBER Working Paper No. 18551

JEL No. I2,J24
ABSTRACT
High school students from disadvantaged high schools in Toronto were invited to take two surveys,
about three weeks apart. Half of the students taking the first survey were also shown a 3 minute video
about the benefits of post secondary education (PSE) and invited to try out a financial-aid calculator.
Most students' perceived returns to PSE were high, even among those not expecting to continue.
Those exposed to the video, especially those initially unsure about their own educational attainment,
reported significantly higher expected returns, lower concerns about costs, and expressed greater likelihood
of PSE attainment.

I. Introduction

Many policy makers implicitly take as given that children and parents are fully informed
when making education attainment decisions. In economics, we also often assume individuals
have full information when deciding how much education to obtain or what programs to take up.
Recent attention is being given to relaxing these assumptions, and the growing body of evidence
suggests that many individuals are, in fact, not fully informed. This especially applies to those
from low-income backgrounds. Kane and Avery (2004), for example, demonstrate that high
school students from low-income family backgrounds have very little understanding of actual
college tuition levels, financial aid opportunities, and the admissions process. A report by the
Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (2001) notes that students and families, as
well as adult learners, are often intimidated by news stories about college being unaffordable.
These stories may contribute to the fact that individuals often greatly overestimate the cost of
higher education (Horn, Chen, and Chapman 2003).

Usher (1998) finds that low-income

individuals overestimate tuition costs by an average factor of two and underestimate the average
annual income differential between high school and university graduates.
Misinformation or unawareness can lead to sub-optimal outcomes. High school students
that view all post secondary programs as unaffordable may miss out on significant returns. On
the other hand, students only focused on university options may struggle to complete and miss
out on more enjoyable careers from vocational schooling or other community college options.
One approach in addressing lack of information is through better advertizing. Currie (2004) and
Dynarski (2002) find that better publicizing financial aid programs leads to higher take-up.
Another approach is through simplification. Dynarski and Scott-Clayton (2006) demonstrate that

1

college financial aid eligibility in the United States can reasonably be explained on a post-card,
matching up parents' adjusted gross income and adjusting for family size. Bettinger et al.
(forthcoming) show that personal assistance in helping complete the financial aid application
markedly increases PSE enrollment.
There is also evidence from developing countries that providing information about the
benefits of PSE may increase motivation in attending. Jensen (2010) surveys students from the
Dominican Republic and finds that while the measured returns to schooling are high, the returns
perceived by students are extremely low. Students provided with information on the higher
measured returns reported increased perceived returns several months later. The least-poor of
these students were also significantly less likely to drop out of school in subsequent years.
Nguyen (2007) arrives at similar conclusions after conducting a similar experiment in
Madagascar. Teachers at randomly selected schools reported to parents and children the average
earnings at each level of education, as well as the implied gain. Providing these figures reduced
the large gap between perceived returns and the statistics provided, and, in addition, improved
average test scores. Dinkelman and Martinez (2011), examined effects from showing Grade 8
Chilean students DVDs of young disadvantaged adults describing their path towards college or
vocational schools. The authors show the presentation led to increased financial aid knowledge,
decreased absenteeism, but little change in overall attainment expectations.
This paper adds to this literature by examining the effects from an internet information
intervention on disadvantaged students in Toronto, Canada.

We tested whether a short

promotional video about higher education affects student interests and expectations about PSE.
High school students from schools in low-income neighborhoods were invited to take two
surveys that about three weeks apart.

The first survey asked demographic questions and

2

questions about students’ knowledge of PSE. A random half of the students who took the first
survey were also shown a short video with accompanying text about PSE and invited to try out a
financial-aid calculator to approximate their own expected grant and loan eligibility in attending
college or university.
Despite the fact that students who received the online information could ignore it or skip
quickly through it, the results are surprisingly clear cut in suggesting that the message mattered.
Students exposed to the additional information about PSE, three weeks later, had higher
expectations of their own return to PSE, were more likely to believe they were eligible for grants,
were less likely to believe the main reason students do not go on to PSE is because of costs, and
were more likely to say they aspired to complete at least a college degree. The effects were
largest among those initially unsure about their education attainment decision, which is
consistent with information-updating models like those discussed in Della Vigna and Gentzkow,
(2010). We also find evidence that the intervention affects not just subjective responses but
behavior. Treated students were more likely to download an additional document that offered
additional (and printable) information about PSE, and were more likely to request additional
information about specific colleges and universities. Overall, our study suggests inexpensive
information campaigns to promote higher education are worth considering for promoting interest
and access.
The next section outlines our experiment and theory of why it may impact students'
decision making in the longer term. Section three describes our data. The fourth section
presents results, and we conclude in section five.

II. The Experiment

The study was carried out in Toronto at 5 public schools, the maximum number our
budget allowed. We chose schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods with the goal of targeting
students unsure about their post secondary attainment or those expecting to enter the labor
market with no more than a high school degree. According to a meta analysis based on academic
performance, our five schools ranked 577, 669, 683, 706, and 707 out of all 718 public schools in
Ontario (Cowley, Easton, and Thomas, 2012). Provincial statistics on these schools also show
substantially lower percentages of students meeting province standards on grade 9 and grade 10
standardized tests. Their one-year transition rates to post secondary institutions for grade 12
students are among the lowest in the city, about 30 percent.
Between December 5th 2008 and January 20th 2009, homeroom teachers distributed
postcard-sized flyers offering $20 for participating in two online surveys (see appendix). All
students were invited to participate Each flyer contained the survey website and a unique
password to access the survey. To reduce the potential for survey contamination, each password
could only be entered into the survey site once.
Students that went online were briefed on the purpose of the study and invited to consent
to participate. They were asked to provide a valid e-mail address. An e-mail address was
required in order to provide the link to the second survey site and distribute the incentive
payment to the participant. The first survey asked students a set of basic demographic questions
about their education aspirations, parental education, ethnicity, and grade performance (the
appendix includes the survey). It also asked questions about education attainment expectations

4

and participants' knowledge of their own financial aid eligibility. The survey concluded by
asking students about why they expect or do not expect to enroll in a PSE program.
After answering the questions, a random half of participants were shown a screen with a
video playing at the top left of the screen, a transcription of its text on the right to allow students
to follow along and accommodate those without speakers, and a simple financial aid calculator at
the bottom left of the screen. The video presented college and university in a positive light,
suggesting that many students who are unsure about post-secondary education may overestimate
costs or not realize financial aid eligibility. Mean earnings differences were presented for 35
year old Torontonians working with a high school degree, a 2-year college degree, or a 4-year
university degree or more. The video was designed to convey key information about potential
earnings differences by education attainment categories, as well as expected costs of PSE, and
financial aid eligibility (see appendix for screen shot and text of video). Students had the ability
to watch the video, as well as estimate the values of the grant and loan for which they would be
eligible if they went to college or university. The financial aid calculator required students to
estimate their parents’ income and the number of siblings attending PSE.

Students were

provided with a drop down list of family incomes. Additionally, there was a button on the
financial aid calculator that allowed students to produce their results in a printable page. On this
page, the financial aid package for Toronto universities and colleges was provided as well as
brief instructions about how to apply.
After trying out the financial aid calculator, students were asked to click ‘done’ when
finished. They were then shown the same page as the control group thanking them for their
participation and reminding them to expect a notice in three weeks about taking the second
survey, along with a reminder that they would receive $20 for completing the second survey

5

(sent electronically via internet banking, or students could opt to receive an amazon.ca gift
certificate or donate $20 to their school).
[Figure 1 about here]
Figure 1 shows the distribution of minutes spent exposed to the treatment webpage. The
median treated student spends three minutes on the webpage, which was the same length of time
as the video. Less than 10 percent watched for less than one minute, while another 10 percent
spent at least 9 minutes watching. To explore whether particular types of students watched the
video more, we regressed time spend watching the treatment webpage on background
characteristics, but found surprisingly little relationship.

Students' education attainment

expectations were uncorrelated with video exposure time. Previous academic performance and
parents' education attainment were also unrelated to time spend on the webpage.

Only a

students' grade level predicted treatment exposure time. Grade 12 students spend about a minute
longer on the webpage than Grade 9 students.
About three weeks after completing the first survey, students were sent a reminder and
link to the second survey. Included in the reminder e-mails were password reminders required
for accessing the second survey site.

The second survey focused on questions about students’

expected earnings under alternative education attainment scenarios, students’ expectations about
grant and loan eligibility, and students’ education attainment expectations.
We asked participants before being treated in the first survey whether they expected their
highest degree to be from high school, a 2-year community college degree, a 4-year university
degree or more, or whether they were unsure. A core prediction from belief-based models with
Bayesian updating is that the information treatment will be more effective for those who are
unsure (Della Vigna and Gentzkow, 2010). New information may cause some of these students

6

to favor more schooling while others less, depending on whether the net expected benefit is
adjusted upwards or downwards. We might also observe some who initially report they intend to
complete college or university degrees to adjust their expectations downwards if the video
lowers their expected rate of return. Another possibility is that the online intervention advertizes
higher education without providing significantly new information (Della Vigna and Gentzkow
call these models preference-based). For example, a reminder that those with more schooling
tend to earn more money may make the relationship more salient when thinking about one's own
earnings outcome, even though the relationship itself is already known. We might expect in this
case to observe changes in educational expectations without changes in expected costs or
benefits, since the student receives no new information with which to update prior beliefs.
However, observing changes in attainment expectations and returns does not necessarily lead to
rejecting the preference-based model; students may still react to the reminder by inflating
earnings expectations more. Preference and belief-based models are not easily distinguishable
because it is often not clear whether advertizing provides new information or not.
The intervention's impact also depends on students' attention to the new information and
interest in retaining it. The salience of the information when trying to decide and the costs
involved from using the information may also play a role. We specifically chose a later date
from the initial survey to test responses to the treatment in order to focus on delayed responses to
information rather than immediate. We also provided an option for participants to indicate
whether they wished to be sent more details regarding specific colleges or universities.
Furthermore, students were able to download a PDF booklet about applying to post-secondary
education.

These 'action outcomes' were added to estimate effects beyond self-reported

outcomes. A concern with subjective responses is that it is low cost for students to respond to

7

new information without being committed. While sample size and budget constraints prevented
us from examining eventual education attainment (and earnings), examining treatment effects on
these action outcomes provides at least some evidence on whether students meaningfully react to
this intervention.

III. Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 describes the student characteristics of survey 1 participants. We delivered 5,017
postcard invitations to the participating schools, one for each student enrolled. 1,616 students
completed the first survey. Since not all students received an invitation due to absences or
compliance, the ratio of students responding to invitations distributed (32 percent) represents a
lower bound for the response rate. The proportion of students by each grade is spread fairly
even. Grade 9 and 12 students account for 28 and 29 percent of the sample respectively; and
grade 10 and 11 students each account for 21 percent of the total sample. 54 percent are female.
The average reported grade for the entire sample is 78 percent, suggesting students with above
average academic ability were more likely to participate in the study. A very large fraction of
respondents are first or second generation immigrants. Of the 1,616 respondents, 41 percent are
immigrants, and only 7 percent have parents both born in Canada. The educational attainment
levels for parents is also quite low: 32 percent of the sample report that their father has a
university degree; 21 percent report that their mother has a university degree.
A large majority of participants, 85 percent, intend to obtain a college or university
degree. This result is due in part to those responding being more likely interested in PSE to
begin with (as indicated by the high average grade), but also due to the tendency for students'

8

expectations to exceed their actual education attainment. For example, Jacob and Wilder (2010)
find 80 percent of recent high school students in the U.S. expect to attain a BA degree, whereas
less than 40 percent actually reach this goal (and fewer still for blacks and males). The authors
note a common explanation for this occurrence is that students underestimate the the difficulty in
completing college or the preparation required to excel. Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2012)
find some evidence this with updated learning about academic ability predicting PSE dropout.
Other researchers model students as trying to conform to the attainment expectations of parents,
teachers, and peers, while failing to account for preparation and difficulty entirely (Haller, 1982).
Our treatment is unlikely to cause downward adjustment to attainment expectations because it
provides no information about students' own abilities. However, expectations may still change
because of remaining doubt about PSE or misinformation about costs and returns.
To explore the hypothesis that disadvantaged students who are unsure about their
education attainment expectations or thinking about stopping at high school may be
overestimating costs or underestimating returns, we separate treatment effect estimates for these
subgroups from the majority expecting to obtain PSE degrees. It is unfortunate that the size of
the sample reporting they intend to stop at high school is so low. We include results for this
group for descriptive purposes, but keep them separate from those unsure in their expectations.
The appendix shows treatment effects for these two groups combined.
In the second survey, participants were asked to answer a series of questions based on
income attainment. Students were informed that average earnings for a 35 year-old in Toronto
are about $38,000. They were then asked “Suppose that you were to graduate from high school,
but not go on to pursue any more schooling. What would you expect your annual income to be at
age 35?”; “How much do you think you would earn if instead you were to complete a two-year

9

college program?”; and “How much do you think you would you earn at age 35 if you completed
a four-year Bachelor’s degree in university?”.

Responses to these questions allow one to

calculate each participant's expected rate of return to college and university. Table 2 shows mean
earnings for the control group, categorized by education attainment expectation reported in
survey 1, as well as the earnings ratios between completing college versus high school and
between completing university versus high school for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile in each
group. Similar to previous studies (Dominitz and Manski, 1996, Betts, 1996, and Botelho and
Pinto, 2003), students vary considerably in their responses but, on average, expected earnings by
education attainment category are similar to actual mean differences observed (from the 2009
Labour Force Survey, the mean income for 34-year-old Torontonians ending school after high
school, community college, and university is $37,000, $49,000, and $59,000 respectively).
Students generally predict higher earnings from greater schooling. Interestingly, the median
return from college or university is substantial, regardless of education attainment intentions.
The median student saying she expects to stop at high school also says she would earn 40 percent
more with a 2-year college degree, and 107 percent more with a 4-year university degree. The
median student expecting to obtain a 2-year college degree expects to earn 32 percent more if
they received a university degree instead, and those unsure about their decision expect an
average rate of return to college and university of 31 percent and 53 percent respectively. Since
these results are self-reported, taking into account expected ability, they suggest that expected
returns cannot explain why some students intend to stop their schooling short. While expected
returns are high for the median in each group, they are negative for those in the 10th percentile.
A potential explanation for the high returns among students opting for less education is
cost concerns. Table 3 reports results from surveying participants about why they think some do

10

not enroll in PSE (for the control group only). The most frequent reason regardless of own
education expectations is cost. More than 60 percent of those unsure about their education
attainment say tuition costs are too high for some to attend. The median expected rate of return
to a university degree for these unsure students is 80 percent whereas the median for unsure
students who do not identify cost as the main reason why some do not go is 18 percent.
Participants indicate poor grades are the second key reason for why some do not go. For the
small group reporting they plan to stop at high school, distaste for school is also an important
explanatory factor.
Of those students who completed the first survey, 60.3 completed the second survey three
weeks later. Importantly, the response rate to the second survey was very similar for the
treatment and control groups (61.2 and 59.6 percent respectively). To further explore potential
response bias, Table 4 presents mean differences in survey 1 background characteristics by
treatment status. Not surprisingly, parents' education, initial education attainment expectations,
gender, previous grades, and immigrant status are generally balanced between groups for those
completing the first survey (before randomization). A few of these variables, however, are not
balanced when conditioning on the sample of students responding to both surveys. The p-value
from an F-test on the joint significance of these variables being different across treatment and
control groups is 0.09. For the sub-sample initially unsure about their final education attainment,
the p-value is 0.29.
We estimate treatment impacts with and without conditioning on the variables listed in
Table 4. In addition, we follow two other approaches recommended by Puma et al. (2009) in
addressing missing data after randomization. The appendix table shows our main results are
robust to weighting observations by predicted probability of completing survey 2, and to

11

interacting each control variable with treatment status. The table indicates similar results for the
sample of students initially unsure about their attainment plans and for the combined sample of
those unsure and those planning on stopping with a high school degree.

IV Results

In this section we present our main program effect estimates. We first examine impacts
on expected PSE benefits and costs to explore evidence of participants responding directly to the
information provided. We then examine interest in PSE more directly by looking at program
effects on attainment expectations and interest in acquiring more information about PSE.
Table 5 shows treatment effects on expected annual earnings at age 35, grouped by
participants' highest expected degree reported in survey 1 (prior to treatment). The first panel
displays results among those unsure about their schooling. As predicted, this group reacts more
than the other participants with stronger priors. Column 1 indicates that those initially unsure
and exposed to the online information subsequently report lower expected earnings from
stopping at high school compared to the control group ($34,512, on average versus $43,542, pvalue = 0.040). Including linear controls for background characteristics (the same variables
listed in Table 4) does not substantially alter the estimates, which is the case for all outcomes
examined in this section. Differences in expected earnings from completing a college or
university degree are not significantly different between treated and control participants.
Overall, the results suggest that the online information changes students' expected rates of
return to PSE from high to very high. Column 7 shows that the ratio between expected college
and high school earnings is 40 percent higher for the treated group than the controls (2.1 versus

12

1.5, p-value = 0.050). The impact on the university-to-high-school expected earnings ratio is
also substantial: 2.8 versus 1.9 (p-value = 0.036). The estimated college and university returns
for the sample reporting an intention to stop at high school are high for both treatment and
control groups (about 80 percent higher earnings from completing college and 140 percent
higher earnings from completing university), but are measured imprecisely because of small
sample size. We do not find any significant change in expected returns to college or university
for the sample predicting to obtain some type of PSE degree. Interestingly, the estimated returns
reported by this group are about the same as the returns reported by the students who intend to
stop at high school.
Table 6 shows program effect estimates on survey responses related to PSE costs. The
notable result is a significant fall in the number of unsure students indicating tuition and other
costs as the main reason why some do not enroll in PSE. The fraction reporting that costs
prevent some from going to PSE falls from 61.7 percent for the control group to 39.1 percent for
the treated. The point estimates for the other cost-related outcomes are consistent with the
possibility of unsure students also becoming more confident about being grant eligible, but the
estimates are not statistically significant at the 10 percent level. The pattern is clearer for the
larger sample of students reporting an intention in survey 1 to complete college or university.
These students are about 7 percentage points more likely to believe they are eligible for grant aid
three weeks after being shown our financial aid calculator and video. There is no significant
change for this group in the fraction reporting cost as a factor in explaining why some do not
attend PSE.
The results above suggest that being shown the online information caused the group
unsure about their educational attainment to adjust their costs and benefits expectations of PSE

13

towards making the decision to attend seem more favorable.,. We do not observe any downward
adjustment in expected returns or upward adjustment in expected costs from the video. In fact,
students expressing the goal of completing a PSE degree appear more aware, after the treatment,
of being eligible for financial aid. Correspondingly, Table 7 indicates a significant fall in
education attainment uncertainty from the treatment for both students initially unsure and those
aiming to go to PSE. Those unsure about their attainment prior to treatment are 18.5 percentage
points less likely to express uncertainty three weeks after treatment (Column 1). Students from
this group shift their response to indicating an expectation of obtaining a PSE degree more
towards a 2-year college than a 4-year university. The results also show a program effect on
attainment expectations for those initially saying they intend to complete PSE. 8.3 percent of
these students in the control group change their response to the same question in the second
survey and indicate being unsure. The program appears to reinforce students' resolve in this
group towards PSE. 3.3 percent fewer report being unsure compared to the control group, while
3.5 percent more maintain their intention of obtaining a PSE degree.
At the end of the second survey students were provided with the opportunity to request
more information; students could download an electronic document with information about PSE
(e.g. with subsections titled 'Why should I go?', 'How do I apply?', 'How do I pay', and 'What
colleges are near me?'). Students could also request to be sent information about a particular
university or college by clicking boxes beside a list of regional schools. As mentioned in section
II, the purpose of recording who accessed this information was to test whether the program
affected more than just subjective survey responses. Table 8 presents these results, along with
program effect estimates on expected grade. For students initially unsure about attainment and
expecting to stop at high school, we observe a higher fraction of those from the treatment group

14

downloading the PSE document and requesting school information. The fraction requesting
more school information almost doubles for the treated group with initial expectations of
stopping at high school, compared to the control group. The other outcome differences are not
large enough to reject the hypothesis that they occurred by chance. If we combine these two
groups (those unsure and those intending to stop at high school) however, the gap in the fraction
downloading the electronic document is statistically significant at the 10 percent level (see
appendix).
Of interest is how our results differ by age or gender. Unfortunately, a small sample size
generally prevents us from conducting subgroup analyses. We do not find strong support for the
possibility that students in later grades are less impacted because they are more informed. In
fact, while the estimated treatment effect on expected returns to PSE for the unsure sample is
smaller for Grade 12's than those in lower grades, the effects on cost concerns and attainment
expectations are higher (though we cannot reject that the two effects are equal). We also cannot
reject that the main effects by gender are equal (because they have large standard errors
associated with them).

V. Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we present results from a small field experiment in which students from
disadvantaged high schools were invited to go on the Internet and take two short surveys. The
students were offered $20 for their participation. At the end of the first survey, a random half
were shown a multi-media page with an easy to follow 3 minute video describing costs and
benefits of PSE, and how to make PSE affordable. Students could also follow along with the

15

text provided beside the video, and estimate their own financial aid eligibility with a financial aid
calculator that only required approximating household income and family size. Three weeks
later, students were asked to complete a second survey, which asked questions about students’
impressions of PSE costs and benefits, as well as their own education attainment expectations.
The purpose of this study was not to design a nationally scalable policy that would lead to
substantial increases in PSE enrollment and completion, but rather to test whether exposing
students from disadvantaged backgrounds to online information might play a role in affecting
prior beliefs about PSE and increase (or perhaps decrease) their interest in going. Stakes were
generally low for the participants: there was no cost for treated respondents to skip over the
information page provided (though they may have assumed they needed to do this to remain
eligible for participation payment). There was also little cost in deciding how to respond
subjectively to the questions or whether to choose to receive additional information.
In this setting, we can classify the study as a framed field experiment, using the
dichotomy outlined by Harrison and List (2004). Participants dealt with a subject of interest
outside the experiment (their own education), but not in an environment where they would
naturally undertake the task of thinking about their long-term plans. A video shown in class or a
homework assignment to estimate one's own financial aid eligibility would more closely
resemble a real program. We cannot rule out the possibility that some students responded
according to what they thought the researchers wanted to observe. But this possibility was likely
similar for the control group, who were also aware they were participating in a study about PSE
and 'life after high school'. The three weeks between surveys allowed for both treated and
control students to get back to their daily lives before being surveyed again. The responses
themselves seem reasonable. In addition, the measured outcome of accessing additional PSE

16

information requires more action and thus, at least slightly, greater cost than not accessing at all.
Despite the intervention lasting only a few minutes and waiting three weeks before
estimating impacts, the results suggest that providing easily accessible information about PSE
matters, especially for those initially uncertain about whether they want to go or can afford PSE.
These students were more likely to adjust their cost concerns downwards and their own expected
return from going upwards from the online information. Correspondingly, this group expressed
less uncertainty and more subsequent interest in completing a PSE degree. We also found some
evidence that those treated were more likely to seek out additional information about next steps
in how to enroll in PSE and how to access financial aid.
Much of the information we provided to selected students is readily accessible online and
likely obtainable by talking with a high school guidance counselor. Most students report they
already believe they would earn significantly more by completing PSE (and those in our treated
group expect an even higher return). The type of financial aid calculator we presented is also
accessible online. One explanation why students reacted to the information we provided is that
we did not require them to seek it out. A common finding from research in social psychology is
that individuals tend towards the status-quo (e.g. Thaler and Sunstein, 2008). In our context, the
status-quo for high school students is not to apply to PSE and not to receive information about
PSE, except what is presented in class. In an environment where day-to-day distractions are
common, adolescents may easily put off learning more about PSE, especially without additional
interest by family and peers.
Students shown the additional information may also have become more salient to the
benefits and affordability of PSE. Students may identify with themselves in different ways
(someone who likes to have fun, plays soccer, or who wants to have a successful career, for

17

example). Each of these identities can be more or less salient at any moment of time and the
relative salience of different identities can significantly affect behavior (Akerlof and Kranton,
2002, McLeish and Oxoby, 2008). Perhaps treated students were more salient of the importance
of PSE for future well-being, and that this additional saliency lasted while they took the second
survey (or reoccurred when they took it). Frequent reminders to students on the benefits and
affordability of PSE (regular campus visits, posters, for example) may improve students’ interest
in going at a time when PSE-related decisions are being made.
Our findings appear more consistent with belief-based models where students' priors are
updated after receiving new information rather than preference-based models where the
treatment promotes PSE without providing new information.

This is because we observe

students adjusting both their expectations about net benefits and about education attainment
rather than just education attainment on its own.
Our findings show students react favorably to information promoting higher levels of
schooling, consistent with results from Jensen (2010), Nguyen (2007), and Dinkelman and
Martinez (2011). Taken overall, they suggest inexpensive information programs may facilitate
transitions from high school to college. Videos, websites, or presentations, especially at times
when students must make decisions affecting PSE outcomes, may lead to higher PSE enrollment
and degree completion.

Notes: Students were informed that average earnings for a 35 year-old in Toronto is about $38,000. They were then asked, "Suppose that
you were to graduate from high school, but not go on to pursue any more schooling. What would you expect your annual income to be at
age 35?" and "How much do you think you would earn if instead you were to complete a two-year college (or four-year university)
program?" The top of the table shows mean responses for the control group sample categorized by highest expected degree. The bottom of
the table shows the expected return to a college or university degree (relative to completing only a high school degree) expressed as an
earnings ratio for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile in each subgroup respectively.

Notes: Treatment difference with controls is the coefficient estimate for treated participants after regressing the outcome variable on it, plus linear controls for female, born in Canada, grade
last year (percent), indicators for whether mother and father's highest degrees were university, survey 1 reports on whether ever thought of dropping out of high school, whether government
guarantees college access, and indicators for expected highest degree in survey 1 (unsure, high school, college, or university). Huber-White robust standard errors are shown in square
brackets. One, two, and three asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively. Calculation of the variables 'Expected Returns to College and University'
is described in more detail in Figure 1 and in the text. Coll. = 2-year college, HS = High School, Univ. = University

Notes: Column 1 shows the treatment effect estimates as in Tables 6 through 9, with linear controls for female, born in Canada, grade last year (percent), indicators for whether mother and father's
highest degrees were university, survey 1 reports on whether ever thought of dropping out of high school, whether government guarantees college access, and indicators for expected highest degree in
survey 1 (unsure, high school, college, or university) for the sample excluding students expecting in survey 1 to go to university. Column 4 shows the same but for the sample excluding students
expecting to go to any college. Columns 2 and 5 display treatment effect estimates from regressing the outcomes on treatment status and reweighting the sample by the inverse probability of
responding to the second survey. Probabilities were estimated using a probit model and the same variables used for controls in columns 1 and 4. Columns 3 and 6 show treatment effect estimates
after interacting the control variables with the treatment indicator (see Puma et al. and text for more details). Huber-White robust standard errors are shown in square brackets. One, two, and three
asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively.

aid calculator (below this video), click on the button below to finish the survey.

As a high school student you’re probably thinking about your future. Whether you are in Grade
10, 11 or 12, you are probably thinking about your life after high school, what you might be
doing next year or in three years or even five or ten years. What about college or university?
You may already be planning to go. Or, you may be wondering whether it’s really worth it, or
whether you can afford it.
Why do I need higher education?
For some, getting a higher education or post-secondary education is not a priority. In fact, you
might know someone who has ‘made it’ without a degree or diploma. However, it is getting
harder and harder to make it in today’s world without a higher education. Today, most
employers require applicants have some form of post secondary education to even be considered
for a job.
Benefits of higher education
There are numerous social and health benefits to higher education. However, the most
significant benefit to a higher education is money! Most students who get some form of higher
education will make significantly more money than those who do not participate or complete
some higher education.
This table shows the average earnings of 35 year old Torontonians with different levels of
schooling.
Level of Schooling

Less than high school

$35,000

High school

$37,000

2-year College diploma

$49,000

4-year University degree

$59,000

In fact, added up over a lifetime, a typical Canadian with a four-year undergraduate degree earns
$1,000,000 more than someone with a high school degree.
Different types of higher education: it’s not a one size fits all
Keep in mind that higher education comes in different shapes and sizes. College is typically 2
years, university is typically 4 years, and both can be completed part time or full time.
OK, but isn’t college and university expensive?
Average tuition and fees in Canada are about $2,000 for colleges and $4,000 for universities per
year. In addition, you’ll have to pay for other things like books and supplies, transportation,

room and board (if you live away from home and sometimes if you remain living with your
parents or other family members). These expenses can add up to a lot of money.

Many students and families may not realize how much is available to them. In fact, very few
students actually pay the “sticker price” or the listed costs of going to a school.
Applying and obtaining financial assistance to go to college or university is like investing in
yourself. It may cost some money now, but students that continue school after high school can
expect to earn more money than a high school graduate.

The government gives out billions of dollars each year to deserving students. At the federal
level, the Canada Student Loans Program offers a wide variety of grants (that do not have to be
paid back) and loans (that do need to be paid back, but usually interest free).

The Ontario government guarantees that no student will be prevented from attending college or
university because of the lack of money. Every student who is accepted into a full-time college
or university program in Ontario will receive enough money to afford to study there.
To see how much money you might be eligible to receive, you can go to the OSAP site use the
fun and simple on-line calculator.
Or, you can use a similar calculator provided in this survey. When you’re finished this video,
click the financial aid calculator link below.
A new window will pop up allowing you to get a good estimate of how much money in grants
and loans you are eligible for if you decide to go to college or university.
Going through the calculator takes only about five minutes. Even if you don’t know all the
information, guess so that you can get an estimate of your aid eligibility right now.
Then you’re done.
You will receive a reminder email in the next couple of weeks telling you when the next part of
the study will take place. During that time, you will be given a new link and asked to log in
again to answer some follow up questions that will take less than 10 minutes. After answering
those questions you will receive your $20 award as a thank you for your full participation in this
research.
Thank you again!
