According to the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, greater firm-specific stock price variation reflects higher intensity firm-specific information capitalization in stock prices. We propose that higher firm-specific price variation may be an indicator of greater functional-form market efficiency in the sense of Tobin (1982).\n\n",
