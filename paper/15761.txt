How Does Life Settlement Affect the Primary Life Insurance Market?

NBER Working Paper No. 15761

JEL No. G22,L11
ABSTRACT
We study the effect of the life settlement market on the structure of long term contracts offered by
the primary market for life insurance, as well as the effect on consumer welfare, using a dynamic model
of life insurance with one sided commitment and bequest-driven lapsation. We show that the presence
of life settlement affects the extent as well as the form of dynamic reclassification risk insurance in
the equilibrium of the primary insurance market, and that the settlement market generally leads to
lower consumer welfare. We also examine the primary insurers' response to the settlement market
when they can offer enriched contracts by specifying optimally chosen cash surrender values (CSVs).

Introduction
A life settlement is a financial transaction in which a policyholder sells his/her life insurance

policy to a third party – the life settlement firm – for more than the cash value offered by the
policy itself. The life settlement firm subsequently assumes responsibility for all future premium
payments to the life insurance company, and becomes the new beneficiary of the life insurance
policy if the original policyholder dies within the coverage period.1 The life settlement industry
is quite recent, growing from just a few billion dollars in the late 1990s to about $12-$15 billion in
2007, and according to some projections, is expected to grow to more than $150 billion in the next
decade (see Chandik, 2008).2
To provide some background information on the life insurance market, the main categories of
life insurance products are Term Life Insurance and Whole Life Insurance.3 A term life insurance
policy covers a person for a specific duration at a fixed or variable premium for each year. If the
person dies during the coverage period, the life insurance company pays the face amount of the
policy to his/her beneficiaries, provided that the premium payment has never lapsed. The most
popular type of term life insurance has a fixed premium during the coverage period and is called
Level Term Life Insurance. A whole life insurance policy, on the other hand, covers a person’s
entire life, usually at a fixed premium. Besides the difference in the period of coverage, term and
whole life insurance policies also differ in the amount of cash surrender value (CSV) received if
the policyholder surrenders the policy to the insurance company before the end of the coverage
period. For term life insurance, the CSV is zero; for whole life insurance, the CSV is typically
positive and pre-specified to depend on the length of time that the policyholder has owned the
policy. Importantly, the CSV on whole life policies does not depend on the health status of the
policyholder when surrendering the policy.4
The opportunity for the life settlement market results from two main features of life insurance
contracts. First, most life insurance policies purchased by consumers, either term or whole life,
have the feature that the insurance premium stays fixed over the course of the policy. Because pol1

The legal basis for the life settlement market seems to be the Supreme Court ruling in Grigsby v. Russell [222 U.S.
149, 1911], which upheld that for life insurance an “insurable interest” only needs to be established at the time the
policy becomes effective, but does not have to exist at the time the loss occurs. The life insurance industry has typically
included a two-year contestability period during which transfer of the life insurance policy will void the insurance.
2
The life settlement industry actively targets wealthy seniors 65 years of age and older with life expectancies from 2
to up to 12-15 years. This differs from the earlier viatical settlement market developed during the 1980s in response to
the AIDS crisis, which targeted persons in the 25-44 age band diagnosed with AIDS with life expectancy of 24 months
or less. The viatical market largely evaporated after medical advances dramatically prolonged the life expectancy of an
AIDS diagnosis.
3
There are other variations such as Universal Life Insurance and Variable Life Insurance that combine some features
of both Term and Whole Life Insurances (see Gilbert and Schultz, 1994).
4
The life insurance industry typically thinks of the CSV from the whole life insurance as a form of tax-advantaged
investment instrument (see Gilbert and Schultz, 1994).

icyholders’ health typically deteriorates over time, the fixed premium implies that policyholders
initially pay a premium that is higher than actuarially fair, but in later years the same premium is
typically actuarially favorable. This phenomenon is known as front-loading. Front-loading implies
that policyholders of long-term life insurance policies, especially those with impaired health, often
have locked in premiums that are much more favorable than what they could obtain in the spot
market. This generates what has been known as the actuarial value of the life insurance policy (see
the Deloitte Report, 2005). Second, as we mentioned earlier, the cash surrender value for life insurance policies is either zero for term life insurance, or at a level that does not depend on the health
status of the policyholder. Because the actuarial value of a life insurance policy is much higher
for individuals with impaired health, the fact that the CSV does not respond to health status provides an opening for the gains of trade between policyholders with impaired health and the life
settlement companies.5 Life settlement firms operate by offering policyholders, who are intending
to either lapse or surrender their life insurance policies, more cash than the cash surrender value
offered by the insurers.
The emerging life settlement market has triggered controversies between life insurance companies who oppose it, and the life settlement industry who supports it. The views from the two
opposing camps are represented by Doherty and Singer (2002) and Singer and Stallard (2005) on
the proponent side, and the Deloitte Report (2005) on the opponent side. Doherty and Singer
(2002) argued that a secondary market for life insurance enhances the liquidity to life insurance
policyholders by eroding the monopsony power of the carrier. This will increase the surplus of
policyholders and in the long run will lead to a larger primary insurance market. On the other
side, life insurance companies, as represented by the Deloitte Report (2005), claim that the life
settlement market, by denying them the return on lapsing or surrendered policies, increases the
costs of providing policies in the primary market. They allege that these costs will have be passed
on to consumers, which would ultimately make the consumers worse off.
A key issue in the contention between the opposing sides is the role of lapsing or surrendering
in the pricing of life insurance in the primary market (see Daily, 2004). There are a variety of
situations in which policyholders may choose to lapse or surrender. First, the beneficiary for
whom the policy was originally purchased could be deceased or no longer need the policy; second,
the policyholder may experience a negative income shock (or a large expense shock) that leads
5

The Deloitte Report (2005, p. 3) states that the CSVs of whole life insurance policies are, by regulation, not allowed
to be conditioned on health impairments of the policyholder who surrenders the policy. Doherty and Singer (2002, p.
18) also argue that regulatory constraints faced by life insurance carriers deter life insurance companies from offering
health dependent cash surrender values: “Such an offering of explicit health-dependent surrender values by a life
insurance carrier, however, would be fraught with regulatory, actuarial, and administrative difficulties. Life insurance
carriers do not offer health-adjusted surrender values, which suggests that these difficulties outweigh the benefits that
carriers would obtain by offering health-dependent surrender values to consumers.” Life settlement firms so far are not
yet regulated in their pricing of life insurance policies.

him to favor more cash now than to leave a bequest.6 In the absence of the life settlement market,
when a health-impaired policyholder chooses to lapse or surrender its policy, the life insurance
company pockets the intrinsic economic value of these policies, which potentially allows the life
insurance company to offer insurance at a lower premium. In the presence of the life settlement
market, these policies will be purchased by the life settlement firms as assets, thus the primary
insurance company will always have to pay their face amount if the original policyholder dies
within the coverage period.
In this paper, we analyze the effect of life settlement on the primary life insurance market.
Using a dynamic equilibrium model of life insurance similar to Hendel and Lizzeri (2003, HL
henceforth) and Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008, DHL henceforth), we study how equilibrium
contracts and consumer welfare are affected by the presence of a life settlements market. We focus
on how the equilibrium properties of the life insurance contracts and the consumer welfare are
affected by life settlement firms in a dynamic equilibrium model of life insurance as in . Hendel
and Lizzeri (2003) studied a model where life insurance companies are risk neutral and can commit to contractual terms (including future premiums and face amounts), and the consumers are
risk averse and cannot commit to remain in the contract they earlier have chosen. Consumers are
subject to mortality risk, which is assumed to be symmetrically observed by the consumers and
the life insurance company. Because consumers’ mortality risks may change over time, they will
face reclassification risk (i.e., changes in insurance premiums) if they have to purchase one-period
contracts from the spot market. HL showed that the competitive life insurance market will in
equilibrium offer long-term life insurance policies that at least partially insure the policyholders
against the reclassification risk, via front-loading of insurance premiums. In a recent paper, Daily,
Hendel and Lizzeri (2008) further assumed that consumers in the second period may lose bequest
motive, and introduced the life settlement market. They compared the consumer welfare with
and without the life settlement market.
In this paper, we first fully characterize the equilibrium life insurance contract in the presence
of a settlement market, assuming that the primary insurers cannot enrich their contract space
to set optimally chosen cash surrender values. We show that the life settlement market affects
the equilibrium life insurance contracts in a qualitatively important manner: with the settlement
market, risk reclassification insurance will be offered in the form of premium discounts, rather than
in the form of flat premiums, as is the case without a settlement market. This may lead to a smaller
degree of front-loading in the first period. We also show a general welfare result that the presence
of the settlement market always leads to a decrease of consumer welfare relative to what could be
achieved in the absence of the settlement market. Moreover, we provide conditions under which

through tough times in an article titled “Source of Cash for Seniors are Drying Up” (November 13, 2008).

the life settlement market could lead to a complete collapse of reclassification risk insurance as a
result of unraveling. We then relax the assumption that prohibits endogenously chosen CSVs, and
find that whether or not CSVs can be made health-contingent has crucial implications. If the cash
surrender values are restricted to be non-health-contingent, we show that endogenous CSV is an
ineffective tool for the primary insurance companies to counter the threat of the life settlement
industry.
Our paper is also related to a large industrial organization literature on secondary markets for
durable goods (see, e.g., Hendel and Lizzeri, 1999; Stolyarov, 2002; House and Leahy, 2004). The
key difference between the life settlement market and the secondary market for durable goods
is as follows. In the durable good case, once the transaction between the primary seller and the
buyer is consummated, the seller’s payoff is not directly affected by whether the buyer sells the
used durable in the secondary market. In contrast, for the case of life settlements, the primary
insurer’s payoff is directly impacted by whether the policyholder chooses to lapse, surrender for
cash value, or to sell the contract to a settlement firm.7
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present a baseline model
without the life settlement market. In Section 3 we extend the baseline model to include the life
settlement market and analyze its effect on primary market contracts and on consumer welfare.
In Section 4 we consider how the welfare results are affected if the life insurance companies can
respond to life settlements by specifying endogenous cash surrender values in the life insurance
contract; in particular we show that whether health-contingent CSVs are allowed has a crucial
effect. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings and discusses directions for future research. All
proofs are collected in the Appendix.

The Baseline Model of Life Insurance without Settlement Market
In this section, we present and analyze a model of dynamic life insurance slightly modified

from Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) and Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008).8
7

Other secondary markets in financial services, such as the home mortgages resale market and the catastrophic
risk reinsurance, operates more like the secondary market for durable goods (see Doherty and Singer, 2002 for some
description of these markets).
8
The two main modifications are as follows. First, we consider a continuous distribution for second-period health
states while HL and DHL considered discrete health states. Second, we slightly change the timing of events: we
assume that income realization and premium payments occur before the resolution of death uncertainty, while HL and
DHL assumed that income and consumption are realized after the death uncertainty is resolved. Neither modification
makes any qualitative difference for this baseline model without the life settlement market; but they simplify some of
our arguments when we introduce the life settlement market.

2.1

The Model

Health, Income and Bequest Motives.

Consider a perfectly competitive primary market for life

insurance that includes individuals (policyholders) and life insurance companies. There are two
periods. In the first period, the policyholder has a probability of death 𝑝1 ∈ (0, 1) known to both
himself and the insurance companies. In the second period, the policyholder has a new probability of death 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1] which is randomly drawn from a continuous and differential cumulative
distribution function Φ(⋅) with a corresponding density 𝜙 (⋅). A consumer’s period 2 health state
𝑝2 is not known in period 1, but 𝑝2 is symmetrically learned by the insurance company and the
consumer, and thus common knowledge, at the start of period 2.
The policyholder’s income stream is 𝑦 − 𝑔 in period 1 and 𝑦 + 𝑔 in period 2, where 𝑦 is interpreted as the mean life-cycle income and 𝑔 ∈ (0, 𝑔¯] with 𝑔¯ < 𝑦 captures the income growth over
the periods. Both 𝑦 and 𝑔 are assumed to be common knowledge.
The policyholder has two sources of utility: his own consumption should he live, and his
dependents’ consumption should he die. If the policyholder lives, he derives utility 𝑢(𝑐) if he
consumes 𝑐 ≥ 0; if he dies, then he has a utility 𝑣(𝑐) if his dependents consume 𝑐 ≥ 0. 𝑢 (⋅) and
𝑣 (⋅) are both strictly concave and twice differentiable.
However, in period 2, there is a chance that the policyholder no longer has a bequest motive.
We denote by 𝑞 ∈ (0, 1) the probability that the policyholder loses his bequest motive.9 The
bequest motive is realized at the same time as the period 2 health state; however, we assume that
it is private information to the policyholder and cannot be contracted upon. If the policyholder
retains his bequest motive, his utility in period 2 is again 𝑢(⋅) if he is alive and 𝑣(⋅) if he dies; if
the policyholder loses bequest motive, then his utility is 𝑢(⋅) if he stays alive, and some constant
which is normalized to zero if he dies.
We assume that there are no capital markets, thus the consumer cannot transfer income from
period 1 to period 2. The only way for the consumer to ensure a stream of income for his dependents is to purchase life insurance.10
Timing, Commitment, and Contracts. Now we provide more details about the timing of events.
At the beginning period 1, after learning the period-1 health state 𝑝1 , the consumer may purchase a long-term contract from an insurance company. A long-term contract specifies a premium
and face value for period 1, ⟨𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ⟩, and a menu of health-contingent premiums and face values
⟨𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 )⟩ for each period-2 health state 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]. In contrast, a spot contract is simply a

A loss of bequest motive could result from divorce, or from changes in the circumstances of the intended beneficiaries of the life insurance policy.

Studying how access to capital markets might affect the demand for life insurance and the welfare effect of life
settlement is an important area for future research.

premium and a face value ⟨𝑄, 𝐹 ⟩ which earns zero expected profit for a given coverage period.
The key assumption is that the insurance companies can commit to these terms in period 2, but
that the policyholders cannot. The one-sided commitment assumption has two important implications. First, it implies that the period-2 terms of the long-term insurance contract must be at least
as desirable to the policyholder as what he could obtain in the period-2 spot market; otherwise,
the policyholder will lapse the long-term contract into a new spot contract. This imposes a constraint on the set of feasible long term contracts that consumers will demand in period 1. Second,
if a policyholder suddenly finds himself without a bequest motive, he could lapse his policy by
refusing to pay the second period premium.
In period 2, after learning the period 2 health state 𝑝2 , the policyholder has three options. He
can either continue with his long-term contract purchased in period 1, or he can let the long-term
policy lapse and buy a period-2 spot contract, or he can let the long-term policy lapse and simply
remain uninsured.

2.2

Equilibrium Contracts
To characterize the equilibrium set of contracts, we first consider the actions of a policyholder

in the second period who no longer has a bequest motive. Given the absence of secondary market,
and we have not yet allowed the insurance companies to buy back contracts through CSVs, the
best course of action for those who no longer have a bequest motive is to simply let the long-term
policy lapse and become uninsured.11
Competition among primary insurance companies ensures that the equilibrium contract is a
long-term contract ⟨(𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ), (𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]⟩ that solves:

The first order conditions for problem (1) with respect to 𝑄1 , 𝐹1 , 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) and 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) are, respectively:

where 𝜇 and 𝜆(𝑝2 ) are respectively the Lagrange multipliers for constraints (2) and (3), and 𝜇 > 0
and 𝜆(𝑝2 ) ≤ 0 must also satisfy the complementary slackness conditions:
𝜆(𝑝2 ) [𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 )] = 0.

(5)

Notice that the first order conditions (4) imply that:
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ) = 𝑣 ′ (𝐹1 ) ,
𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 )) = 𝑣 ′ (𝐹2 (𝑝2 )) for all 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1] .

(6a)
(6b)

Thus in equilibrium a policyholder obtains full-event insurance in every state in both periods. (6a)(6b) also imply that there is a one-to-one relationship between the face amounts (𝐹1 and 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) ,
respectively) and premiums (𝑄1 and 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) , respectively) policyholders will obtain in equilibrium; thus it suffices to characterize the equilibrium premiums 𝑄1 and 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1].
Moreover, because 𝑢′ and 𝑣 ′ are decreasing, the face amounts must decrease with the premium in
every state in both periods.
To characterize the equilibrium premiums, it is useful to divide the support of the secondperiod health states 𝑝2 into two subsets ℬ and 𝒩 ℬ depending on whether the no-lapsation constraint (3) binds. We have the following lemma:
Lemma 1. If 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ and 𝑝′2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ then 𝑝2 < 𝑝′2 and 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑄2 (𝑝′2 ).
Lemma 1 implies the existence of a threshold 𝑝∗2 such that 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ if 𝑝2 < 𝑝∗2 and 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ if
𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 . To characterize the equilibrium premiums 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), it is useful to define the fair premium
and face amount for full-event insurance under health state 𝑝2 in the second period, denoted by
with bequest motives in the second period.

)

(8)

where (7) ensures that the premium is actuarially fair, and (8) ensures full-event insurance as
defined earlier.13
From Lemma 1, we have that for all 𝑝2 < 𝑝∗2 , (3) is binding; together with the full-event insurance conditions (6b), we must have 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) = 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 < 𝑝∗2 . If 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 , then we know
from Lemma 1 that 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ, thus 𝜆 (𝑝2 ) = 0. Therefore the first order conditions (4a) and (4c)
imply that:
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 )) .

(9)

Equation (9) implies that if 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 , the premium 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) must be independent of 𝑝2 ; moreover, it
must satisfy
𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) = 2𝑔 + 𝑄1 .

(10)

Finally, the following lemma characterizes the equilibrium premium for 𝑝2 = 𝑝∗2 if 𝑝∗2 < 1 :
Lemma 2. If 𝑝∗2 < 1, then the equilibrium contract satisfies the following at 𝑝2 = 𝑝∗2 :
𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 ) = 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 ),
(
)
𝑢′ 𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 ) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ) .

(11)
(12)

Lemma 2 implies that the threshold 𝑝∗2 is uniquely determined by the following equation:
𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 ) = 2𝑔 + 𝑄1 .

(13)

Summarizing the above discussions, we have shown that in the baseline model, the equilibrium premium profile over period-2 health states follows the increasing actuarially fair premium

]−1
profile 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (⋅) as 𝑝2 approaches 𝑝∗2 = 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼
(2𝑔 + 𝑄1 ), but remains constant at 𝑄1 + 2𝑔 for
𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 . Figure 1 depicts the equilibrium premiums in the second period as a function of the
period-2 health state 𝑝2 .14
The remaining element of the equilibrium long-term contract, i.e. the first period premium 𝑄1
(and thus also 𝐹1 ), is determined from the zero profit condition (2). Since we have shown that for
The equation system (7) and (8) has a unique solution because 𝑢′ and 𝑣 ′ are both decreasing in their arguments.
Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) made the ingeneous observation that excatly the same outcome for the consumers would
obtain if the insurance company offers a contract that guarantees the second period premium to be 𝑄1 +2𝑔 for all health
states.

[𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 )] 𝑑Φ (𝑝2 ) = 0.

(14)

Because 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 , the second term in the left hand side of (14) is negative,
i.e., the insurance company in equilibrium will for sure suffer a loss in the second period; thus,
the zero-profit condition (14) requires that 𝑄1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 > 0. In other words, the insurance company
demands in the first period a premium 𝑄1 that is higher than the actuarially fair premium 𝑝1 𝐹1
for the period-1 coverage alone. This is exactly the phenomenon of front-loading. In equilibrium,
consumers accept a front loaded premium in exchange for reclassification risk insurance. This reclassification risk insurance takes the form of flat premiums in the second period for all health states
𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 .
Two useful observations are in order. First, one can show that 𝑝∗2 will always be greater than 𝑝1 ,
the period-1 death probability. To see this, suppose to the contrary that 𝑝∗2 < 𝑝1 , hence 𝑝1 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ.
From (10), we have 𝑄2 (𝑝1 ) = 𝑄1 + 2𝑔. The first order conditions (6a) and (6b) then imply that if
𝑄2 (𝑝1 ) = 𝑄1 + 2𝑔, it must be the case that 𝐹2 (𝑝1 ) = 𝐹1 . Since by assumption 𝑝1 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ, we have
𝑄2 (𝑝1 ) − 𝑝1 𝐹2 (𝑝1 ) = (𝑄1 + 2𝑔) − 𝑝1 𝐹1 < 0; hence 𝑄1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 < −2𝑔 < 0. This contradicts the
zero-profit constraint, which requires that 𝑄1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 is positive whenever 𝑝∗2 < 1.
One can also show that when 𝑔 is sufficiently small, then 𝑝∗2 < 1; i.e., there must be some degree
9

of reclassification risk insurance and front-loading in equilibrium. To see this, suppose that 𝑝∗2 = 1,
that is, suppose that no-lapsation constraint (3) binds for all 𝑝2 , then first order conditions (4) imply
that 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 )) ≤ 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ) for all 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1). Since 𝑢 is concave, this in turn implies
that 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑄1 + 2𝑔 for all 𝑝2 . However, for any 𝑝 > 𝑝1 , it must be the case that 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) > 𝑄1 if
𝑝2 ∈ ℬ.15 Thus when 𝑔 is sufficiently small, it is impossible to have both 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑄1 + 2𝑔 for all
𝑝2 and 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) > 𝑄1 for all 𝑝2 > 𝑝1 .
The above discussions are summarized below, which replicates Parts 1-3 of Proposition 1 in
Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) with some slight modifications.
Proposition 1. (Hendel and Lizzeri 2003) The equilibrium set of contracts satisfies the following:
1. All policyholders obtain full event insurance in period 1, and in all period-2 health states as defined
by (6);
2. There is a period-2 threshold health state 𝑝∗2 (which is higher than the period 1 death probability 𝑝1 )
such that for all 𝑝2 ≤ 𝑝∗2 the period-2 premiums are actuarially fair, and for all 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 the period-2
premiums are constant, actuarially favorable and given by 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) = 𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 ) = 𝑄1 + 2𝑔;
3. When the income growth parameter 𝑔 is sufficiently small, 𝑝∗2 is strictly less than 1, i.e. reclassification
risk insurance is provided for policyholders with low income growth.
The following proposition provides a comparative statics result about how the probability of
bequest motive loss 𝑞 affects the contract profile, front-loading and reclassification risk insurance:
Proposition 2. Let 𝑞ˆ > 𝑞. Let unhatted and hatted variables denote equilibrium for 𝑞 and 𝑞ˆ respectively.
ˆ 1 < 𝑄1 and 𝑝ˆ∗ < 𝑝∗ .
Suppose that 𝑝∗ < 1. Then in equilibrium 𝑄

Proposition 2 states that as the probability of losing bequest motive increases from 𝑞 to 𝑞ˆ, the
first period premium will be lower, which implies that there will be less front-loading in the first
period in equilibrium.16 At the same time, however, a higher degree of reclassification risk is
offered in the second period, i.e., more states are offered actuarially favorable contract terms and
premiums are lower across the board. The intuition is quite simple. In the current setting without
a settlement market, policyholders who lose bequest motives in period 2 will lapse their policy,
15
To see this, note that under the hypothesis that the set 𝒩 ℬ is empty, it must be the case that (𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ) is actuarially
fair, i.e. 𝑄1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 = 0. Because (𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ) and (𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) , 𝐹2 (𝑝2 )) must both provide full-event insurance as defined by
(6a) and (6b), if 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑄1 , it must be that 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) > 𝐹1 for any 𝑔 > 0. But then for all 𝑝2 > 𝑝1 ,

𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑄1 − 𝑝2 𝐹1 < 𝑄1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 = 0,
contradicting the assumption 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ.
16
Because period-one premium 𝑄1 is lower and period-one face amount 𝐹1 (from full-event insurance condition) is
higher, the amount of front-loading, namely 𝑄1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 , must be lower.

10

which results in a net profit for the life insurance companies; because the life insurance companies
are competitive, they are able to pass these profits onto consumers in the form of lower first period
premiums and a higher degree of reclassification risk insurance. We call this phenomenon lapsation
based pricing.

Introducing the Life Settlement Market
We now introduce the life settlement market. Policyholders who lose bequest motive in period

2 can now sell their contracts to life settlement firms. If a policyholder with period-2 death probability 𝑝2 sells her policy to a life settlement firm, the life settlement firm will pay her premium to
the life insurance company and collect the death benefit if the policyholder dies.
We now specify the amount that the policyholder receives from the settlement firm when she
sells her policy. To this end, we introduce the concept of the actuarial value of a life insurance
policy. Suppose that a policyholder purchased a long-term life insurance policy in period 1 that
specifies a premium 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) for a death benefit of 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) if her period-2 health state realization is
𝑝2 . Then the actuarial value of the contract at health state 𝑝2 is 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) ≡ 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ). As an
example, recall from Proposition 1 that in the equilibrium without a secondary market, the longterm policies are such that in period-2, the actuarial values 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) ≡ 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) is strictly
positive for 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 . If policyholders with period-2 health states 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 lose bequest motive, they
will prefer to capture some of the positive actuarial value rather than let the policy lapse. This,
as we described in the introduction, is the source of surplus for the life settlement market. We
assume that a policyholder will receive a fraction 𝛽 ∈ (0, 1) of the actuarial value of the policy if
she sells her life insurance policy to the settlement firm, where 𝛽 < 1 represents either the degree
of competition in the secondary market or the amount of fees/commissions/profits etc. that are
spent by settlement firms.17
We assume that the secondary market only operates in period 2.18 We also assume that policyholders make their decisions about whether to sell a contract on the secondary market after
learning the realization of period-2 health state and bequest motive, but before the realization of
the death uncertainty. Finally, we make the natural assumption that the resale price of the contract
is paid to the policyholder upon transfer of the policy to the settlement company and before the
death uncertainty is realized.
17
Currently the life settlement industry typically offers about 20% of the death benefits to sellers after commissions
and fees. Since 𝛽 is relative to the actuarial value, the plausible range of 𝛽 is 0.4 to 0.6 (see Life Insurance Settlement
Association (2006)).
18
This is an innocuous assumption because the zero-profit condition on the primary market ensures that all period 1
contracts are actuarially fair, and thus there is no surplus to be recovered on a secondary market for period 1 contracts.

3.1

Equilibrium Contracts With Settlement Market
Now we characterize the equilibrium contract in the presence of the secondary market. To

start, we note that in period 2 a policyholder will sell her contract to the settlement firm if and only
if she no longer has a bequest motive.19 In the presence of settlement firms, the insurance companies in the primary market will choose a long-term contract ⟨(𝑄𝑠1 , 𝐹1𝑠 ), {(𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩
to solve:20

(16)

where 𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) ≡ 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) is the actuarial value of the contract in period 2 for a policyholder with health status 𝑝2 . Note that there are two key differences between the problems with
and without the settlement market. First, the consumer’s expected utility functions (1) and (15)
differ in that, for the case with the secondary market, the term 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) enters in (15), reflecting
the added amount of consumption from selling the policy to the settlement firm when the policyholder no longer has bequest motive. Second, the zero-profit condition for the insurance company
∫
now does not have the 1 − 𝑞 term multiplying [𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )] 𝑑Φ(𝑝2 ) in (16). The 1 − 𝑞 term
is no longer in the zero profit condition because when there is a secondary market, no policyholders with a positive actuarial value will let their contracts lapse, and the insurance companies are
liable for paying the death benefits for all policies in the second period and of course also collect
all contracted second-period premiums.
It is useful to emphasize that the problem without settlement market does not correspond to
a special case of the problem with settlement firms by setting 𝛽 = 0. Setting 𝛽 = 0 would have
restored the objective function in problem (15) to be identical to that in (1), but the zero profit
condition (16) would still be different from that of (2). Put it differently, even if policyholders
are selling their policies for free, the primary insurer is still liable for every policy sold to the
settlement market, thus 1 − 𝑞 does not enter the zero profit constraint.
Similar to the case without the secondary market, the first order conditions for an optimum
19

If a policyholder still has bequest motive, she will never sell her original policy and repurchase on the spot market because the best she could do if she sells is to get the full actuarial value of her original contract, but she will
subsequently repurchase a spot contract with the same face amount.
20
We use superscript 𝑠 to denote the contract terms for the secondary market case.

12

with respect to 𝑄𝑠1 , 𝐹1𝑠 , 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) and 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) are respectively as follows:
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ) = 𝜇

(1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) = 𝜇 +

(18c)
(18d)

where, again, 𝜇 ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multipliers for (16) and 𝜆(𝑝2 ) ≤ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier for the no-lapsation constraint (18d) for period-2 health state 𝑝2 , with the complementarity
slackness condition:
𝜆(𝑝2 ) [𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )] = 0.

(19)

From the first order conditions (18), we immediately have:
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ) = 𝑣 ′ (𝐹1𝑠 )

(20)

𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) = 𝑣 ′ (𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) for all 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1] .

(21)

Thus, as in the case without settlement firms, we again see that the equilibrium terms of the contract ⟨(𝑄𝑠1 , 𝐹1𝑠 ), {(𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩ must provide full-event insurance in both periods
and in all health states. Denote the set of states for which the no-lapsation constraints bind and
do not bind respectively as ℬ 𝑠 and 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 . Lemma 3 is an analog of Lemma 1 for the case with
secondary market:
Lemma 3. If 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ 𝑠 and 𝑝′2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 , then 𝑝2 < 𝑝′2 and 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝′2 ).
As in the case without a secondary market, Lemma 3 below shows that there exists a threshold

period-2 health state 𝑝𝑠∗

(23)

Recall from Lemma 2 that, in the case without a settlement market, the threshold 𝑝∗2 does not
depend on q, the probability of bequest motive loss. In contrast, Lemma 4 shows when there is
a settlement market, 𝑝𝑠∗
2 is related to both both 𝛽 and 𝑞. This fact plays an important role for the
unraveling result reported in Proposition 6 below.

Figure 2: Equilibrium Period-2 Premium Profile 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ): The Life Settlement Market Case.

Lemmas 3 and 4 establish that the equilibrium contract with a secondary market has some
resemblance to that without the secondary market. Proposition 3 shows, however, that the secondary market also leads to an important qualitative difference in the way the primary insurance
market provides reclassification risk insurance to the consumers.
Proposition 3. (Period-2 Premium at Non-binding Health States) In the presence of the life settlement
𝑠
market, for 𝑝2 > 𝑝𝑠∗
2 , the second-period premium 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) is such that:

1. 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝2 ) ;
2. 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) is strictly increasing in 𝑝2 when 𝑞 > 0.
Proposition 3 shows that with the life settlement market, reclassification risk insurance will no
longer take the form of guaranteed flat premiums in the second period, as is the case when the
settlement market does not exist; instead, the long-term contract now offers partial reclassification
risk insurance in the form of premium discounts relative to the spot market premium. Figure 2
depicts the qualitative features of the second-period premium file 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) . Of course, the health
states for which such partial reclassification risk insurance will be provided, i.e., the set 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 , may
be different from the set 𝒩 ℬ that is relevant for the case without secondary market.
We now provide some comparative statics results with the settlement market.

premium for 𝑞 and 𝑞ˆ.
Proposition 4 tells us that the higher the probability that the consumers may lose bequest motives, the lower is the first-period premium. At a first glance, this seems to be just an analog of
Proposition 2 for the case without the settlement market, but this analogy is misleading. When
there is no settlement market, a higher 𝑞 directly increases the probability of lapsation and thus
lowers the probability that the insurance company has to pay the death benefits in period 2. The
primary insurance companies under competition will thus lower first period premiums (i.e., lower
front-loading) and lower 𝑝∗2 (i.e. offer more dynamic insurance), as shown in Proposition 2. Notice
that lower front-loading can be compatible with more dynamic insurance when there is no settlement market because offering more dynamic insurance (i.e. lowering 𝑝∗2 ) can still be less costly if
more of these contracts will lapse (and hence no death benefit payments are necessary) as a result
of a higher 𝑞.
The presence of the settlement market, however, ensures that the primary insurer will not be
able avoid paying death benefits even when the policyholder loses her bequest motive. Thus
the comparative statics result reported in Proposition 4 does not result from the direct effect that a
higher 𝑞 reduces the probability of paying out death benefits. It instead arises because the nature of
the dynamic insurance in equilibrium is fundamentally changed: it is now in the form of premium
discounts instead of flat premiums,as proved in proposition 3. Offering premium discounts is a
less costly way of providing dynamic insurance than offering flat premiums, which allows the
primary insurers to lower the first period premium.
Another useful piece of intuition to explain both Propositions 2 and 4 is that the demand for
consumption smoothing increases when 𝑞 gets higher. Specifically, as 𝑞 gets higher, it becomes
more likely for the policyholder to be in period 2 with high income and no bequest motive. As
such, they would prefer to transfer income from this period-2 state to the first period, where
income is lower, if they could. This transfer occurs indirectly through lower first period premiums
when 𝑞 is higher.
An important difference in terms of comparative statics results with respect to 𝑞 between the
cases with and without the settlement market is in how 𝑞 affects 𝑝∗2 and 𝑝𝑠∗
2 . Proposition 2 tells us
that when there is no settlement market, the insurance companies will respond to a higher 𝑞 by
lowering the first period premium and increasing dynamic insurance (i.e. a lower 𝑝∗2 ). With the
settlement market, we already showed that the primary insurers will also respond to a higher 𝑞 by
lowering the first period premium, but it is no longer clear that 𝑝𝑠∗
2 is also lowered. Indeed, a more
plausible conjecture would be that 𝑝𝑠∗
2 increases with 𝑞. The intuition is that when the period-one
premium is lowered, the zero-profit condition would require that the primary insurers offer less
15

insurance (here, again, note importantly that a higher 𝑞 does not allow the primary insurers to pay
less death benefits when there is settlement market). This intuition is complicated, however, by
the fact that the shape of 𝑄𝑠2 (⋅) itself may be affected by 𝑞, as shown in Figure 2, and the first order
conditions (18a)-(18d). At a global level, we must expect to see a decline of 𝑝𝑠∗
2 as 𝑞 decreases from
very large values to small values.21 However, at a local level, without further assumptions, we are
unable to prove that an increase in 𝑝𝑠∗
2 lowers the second-period loss for the primary insurers.
We also state a simple comparative statics result in terms of consumer welfare with respect to 𝛽,
the parameter that measures the competitiveness or the efficiency (i.e. loadings) of the settlement
market. The result follows from the envelope theorem after recognizing that, in the optimization
problem given by (15)-(17), the parameter 𝛽 only appears in the objective function.
Proposition 5. An increase in 𝛽 increases consumer welfare.
The effect of 𝛽 on the structure of equilibrium contracts is much harder to establish. The complication is similar to what we described above related to the effect of 𝑞, in that a change in 𝛽 can
potentially affect the shape of 𝑄𝑠2 (⋅) .

3.2

Welfare Effects of the Settlement Market
In this section, we describe the effects of the settlement market on consumer welfare. We first

consider a limiting result to demonstrate a potentially stark effect of the secondary market on the
extent to which reclassification risk insurance can be achieved by the primary insurers.
Proposition 6. (Potential for Unraveling) Fix 𝑢 (⋅, ) , 𝑣 (⋅) , 𝑦 and Φ (⋅) . There is a threshold 𝑞ˆ > 0 such
that if 𝑞 > 𝑞ˆ, then 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 = ∅ for any 𝑔, that is, the equilibrium contract is the set of spot market contracts
for all period-2 health states.
Proposition 6 shows that in the presence of the life settlement market, the primary life insurance market can no longer offer any dynamic reclassification risk insurance for any level of 𝑔,
when 𝑞 is sufficiently large. This result provides a stark contrast to Claim (3) in Proposition 1
which states that, without life settlement, the equilibrium contract offered by life insurance companies must involve some degree of reclassification risk insurance when 𝑔 is sufficiently small for
any 𝑞 < 1. Proposition 6 thus tells us that settlement market may lead to the unraveling of the
capacity of primary life insurance market to offer dynamic reclassification risk insurance.
Note that Proposition 6 provides a clear welfare ranking of the equilibria with and without
the settlement market for environments with small 𝑔 and large 𝑞 : without the settlement market,
21

For sufficiently large values of 𝑞, Proposition 6 below shows that the settlement market unravels reclassification
risk insurance, and thus 𝑝𝑠∗
2 = 1. But for 𝑞 = 0, there is no scope for a settlement market and Proposition 1 shows
∗
𝑝𝑠∗
2 = 𝑝2 < 1.

16

when 𝑔 is small and 𝑞 is large, the equilibrium contracts must offer dynamic reclassification risk
insurance; with the settlement market, the equilibrium insurance contracts must be spot contracts.
Thus the settlement market reduces consumer welfare when 𝑔 is small and 𝑞 is large.
Our next proposition shows that the same welfare ranking between the cases with and without
a settlement market holds more generally, even when reclassification risk insurance is offered in
both environments.
Proposition 7. (Welfare Effects of the Secondary Market) Consumer welfare is reduced by the presence
of a life settlement market.
The argument we use in proving Proposition 7 is as follows: for any contract that is feasible –
including the equilibrium contract – with a secondary market, we show that there exist a feasible
contract without the secondary market. The constructed contract for the no settlement market case
offers identical coverage as the original contract for the settlement market case, except at a lower
first-period premium, which is made possible by lapsation pricing. We show that consumers are
weakly better off under the constructed contract.
Proposition 7 formalizes an intuitive argument provided in Claim 3 of Proposition 2 in Daily,
Hendel and Lizzeri (2008). They argued that the settlement market effectively transfers resources
from period 1 when income is relatively low to period 2 when income is relatively high in the
event of losing bequest motive. Such transfers, due to concavity of the utility function, are welfare reducing. The informal argument provided in their paper hinges on the hypothesis that the
first-period equilibrium premium in the primary market is higher with the settlement market than
without. This hypothesis does not hold in general. An extreme example of this is provided already in Proposition 6. When 𝑞 is sufficiently large, Proposition 6 establishes that the primary
insurance market can not offer any dynamic insurance, which implies that the first period premium is 𝑄𝑠1 = 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 , the actuarially fair premium. In contrast, when 𝑔 is small, Proposition 1 tells
us that without the settlement market there will be dynamic insurance, implying that the first period premium 𝑄1 > 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 because of front-loading. Thus, for sufficiently large 𝑞 and small 𝑔, the
first-period equilibrium premium in the primary market is lower with the settlement market than
without. Our proof does not rely on such cross-regime comparisons of first-period equilibrium
premiums. Even though the first period equilibrium premium may be lower with the settlement
market than without the settlement market, the reduction in first period premium occurs only by
forgoing potentially welfare enhancing reclassification risk insurance.
Many would consider the emergence of the settlement firms as a form of market completion
(e.g., Doherty and Singer (2002)). After all, consumers who lose their bequest motives in period 2
can share the surplus in the actuarial value of their policy with the settlement firm, something they
could not do when there is no settlement market. So on a first glance, the welfare result in Propo17

sition 7 is somewhat counter-intuitive. However, from the classical Lipsey and Lancaster (1956),
we know that, loosely, once we depart from complete markets (or all the conditions required for
the optimality of equilibrium), it is possible that the next-best solution may not be the one with
the least degree of market incompleteness. Because the market incompleteness due to the lack of
commitment is present with or without the settlement firms, we are in a second-best world.22
Another intuition that may be useful for understanding the welfare result is the following. The
settlement market allows policyholders access to the actuarial value in their policies, and thus may
be interpreted as contributing to market completeness. At the same time, however, the settlement
market weakens the consumer’s ability to commit to not asking for a return of their front loaded
premiums in the event that they lose their bequest motive. This weakening of the consumers’
commitment power can be interpreted as contributing further to market incompleteness.

Endogenous Cash Surrender Values
So far, we have assumed that the response of the primary market to settlement firms is re-

stricted to choosing contracts of the form ⟨(𝑄𝑠1 , 𝐹1𝑠 ), {(𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩ . It is possible
that, facing the threat from the life settlement market, the primary insurers may start to enrich their
contracts by specifying endogenously chosen cash surrender values (CSV). We distinguish two possibilities of cash surrender values depending on whether they could be contingent on the health
of the policyholder at the time she surrenders the policy to the primary insurer. The categories
of market regimes we consider in this section, defined by the combination of whether there is a
settlement market and what type of CSVs are allowed in the contract, are summarized in Table
1. The case of non-health contingent CSVs is interesting for at least two reasons. First and foremost, current U.S. regulations allows life insurance companies to offer CSVs that depend on the
tenure of the policy, but prohibits them from offering health-contingent CSVs (see, e.g., Gilbert and
Schultz (1994, Chapter 6)). In fact, currently almost all term life insurance policies have zero CSVs
and most whole life insurance policies have very low and non-health-contingent CSVs. Second,
health-contingent CSVs may not be easy to enforce.
In this section, we first study the case in which the primary insurers can specify health-contingent
CSVs in the life insurance contracts of the form ⟨(𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ), {(𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ), 𝑆 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩
where the additional term 𝑆 (𝑝2 ) specifies the cash surrender value a policyholder can receive from
the primary insurer if she surrenders the contract when her period-2 health status is 𝑝2 . Notice that
by paying 𝑆 (𝑝2 ) , the primary insurer can avoid paying the death benefit, but does not receive the
premium payment in period-2. This is significantly different from when the policyholder sells the
22
For example, Levin (2001) showed that in an Akerlof lemons model, greater information asymmetries between the
buyers and the sellers do not necessarily reduce the equilibrium gains from trade.

contract to the settlement market, in which case the primary insurer still receives payment of the
period-2 premium, but remains responsible for paying the death benefits. We show in Section 4.1
that in the absence of the settlement market, the option of specifying health-contingent CSVs will
not be exercised in equilibrium by the life insurance companies. We thus immediately know that
the equilibrium contracts and equilibrium consumer welfare under regimes A, A’ and A” will be
identical. We then show in Section ?? that under regime D, when there is a settlement market
and when the primary insurers are allowed to enrich their contracts by offering health-contingent
CSVs, the consumer welfare will be improved relative to that under regime B, but still lower than
that under regime A. In Section 4.3, we study regime C where there is a settlement market and the
primary insurers are restricted to specify only non-health contingent CSVs. We prove a surprising
result that, if restricted to non-health contingent CSVs, the primary insurers will offer zero CSV in
equilibrium, and thus the consumer welfare and equilibrium contract are identical to those under
regime B.

4.1

Endogenous Cash Surrender Values Without a Secondary Market
As a benchmark, we here show that, in the absence of a life settlement market, the consumers

will optimally choose to set 𝑆 (𝑝2 ) = 0 when the feasible contract space is enriched to include
health contingent CSVs (regime A’).
The competitive insurance companies under this regime will choose a long-term contract in
the form of ⟨(𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ), {(𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ), 𝑆 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩ to solve:

then for such 𝑝2 , we will have 𝛾(𝑝2 ) = 0; then the first order conditions (28a) and (28e) would
immediately imply that 𝑢′ (𝑦+𝑔+𝑆(𝑝2 )) = 𝑢′ (𝑦−𝑔−𝑄1 ), which is impossible. We can thus conclude
that, without a secondary market, the primary insurance companies will choose in equilibrium
not to include a health-contingent CSV option in their long-term contract. The proposition below
summarizes this discussion:
Proposition 8. In the absence of a settlement market, the option to include surrender values in long-term
contracts will not be used by the life insurance companies. Thus equilibrium contracts and outcomes for the
consumers will be identical regardless of whether health-contingent CSVs are allowed.
20

Proposition 8 is consistent with the observation that term life insurance products indeed do not
carry any cash surrender value. Whole Life insurance policies, as we mentioned in the introduction, often do specify a low amount of cash surrender value if the policyholder cancels the policy
prior to death. The industry has typically advertised the cash surrender value option as a redemption of front-loaded premium payments, even though many industry analysts disagree and think
that it should be better interpreted as a saving instrument that exploits the tax advantages of life
insurance payouts (see, e.g., Gilbert and Schultz (1994, Chapter 6)). Proposition 8 suggests the latter interpretation is more appropriate; in the absence of threats from secondary market, it would
have been efficient not to specify any cash surrender value in a pure life insurance contract.
It is interesting to note that Proposition 7 can be seen as a corollary of Proposition 8 and Proposition 5. To see this, note that when 𝛽 = 1, problem (15) is a special case of problem (24) by
restricting 𝑆 (𝑝2 ) = 𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 . Thus the consumer welfare at the optimum of problem (24),
and thus by Proposition 8 the consumer welfare under regime A as well, is at least as high as
that of problem (15), even when 𝛽 = 1. But from Proposition 5, the consumer welfare is actually
highest when 𝛽 = 1 for regime B. Thus consumer welfare is always higher under regime A than
under regime B for all 𝛽 ∈ (0, 1], which is precisely what Proposition 7 states.

Endogenous Health-Contingent Cash Surrender Values with a Settlement
Market
Now we consider equilibrium contracts with health-contingent surrender values in the pres-

ence of a settlement market. The key difference from problem (24) above is that the cash surrender value now must be no less than what the policyholder could obtain from the settlement
market, while in problem (24) 𝑆 (𝑝2 ) needs to be no less than 0. Denote the equilibrium contract
with a settlement market and endogenous CSVs with the superscript 𝑠𝑠. The competitive insur𝑠𝑠

where constraint (32) reflects the requirement that the endogenous CSV must be at least as high
23
as what the policyholder can obtain from the settlement firms, i.e., 𝛽 [𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
2 (𝑝2 )] . The

insurance company will never set the cash surrender value to be lower than what could be obtained on the secondary market because by offering just an 𝜀 more, the insurance company can
repurchase the policy for 𝛽𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 )+𝜀. This is preferred to letting the policy sold on the settlement
market, in which case the insurance compnay is liable for 𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ).
Arguments similar to those used in the proof of Proposition 8 above show that:
Lemma 5. In the presence of a secondary market, health-contingent cash surrender values 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) will be
optimally chosen to be equal to the amount that can be obtained from the secondary market.
Arguments analogous to those used in the proof of Lemmas 3 and 4 can be easily adapted to
show that there exists a threshold period-2 health state 𝑝𝑠𝑠∗
2 above which second period premiums
are actuarially favorable; moreover at 𝑝𝑠𝑠∗
2 , the equilibrium contract must satisfy conditions analogous to those of Lemma 4.24 Thus, the equilibrium contracts with endogenous health-contingent
CSVs and the settlement market (i.e. regime D) are qualitatively similar to the case of settlement
market without CSVs (i.e. regime B). However, as we emphasized earlier, even though the primary
insurance companies would have to offer cash surrender values that exactly match the secondary
market, their payoffs are fundamentally different depending on whether the primary insurers are
offering endogenously chosen CSVs. When 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) is endogenously chosen, once a consumer
with health state 𝑝2 loses bequest motive, she will surrender her policy to the primary insurance
company in exchange for CSV 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) , but the insurance company does not receive further pre𝑠𝑠
mium payment 𝑄𝑠𝑠
2 (𝑝2 ) and would not have to pay out death benefits 𝐹 (𝑝2 ) . When there are no

CSVs, the primary insurer will continue to receive premium payments from the settlement firm,
but will have to pay the death benefit. It is a priori not clear how the endogenous CSV will affect
the quantitative features of the contracts. The following proposition, however, shows that in the
presence of the settlement market, the option of endogenously choosing health-contingent cash
surrender values will lower the period-2 health threshold above which partial reclassification risk
insurance is provided by the dynamic contract:

Proposition 9. In the presence of a settlement market, 𝑝𝑠𝑠∗
2 < 𝑝2 where 𝑝2 and 𝑝2 are respectively the

period-2 health state thresholds above which reclassification risk insurance is provided under regimes D and
B respectively.
The intuition for Proposition 9 is quite simple. When primary insurers are allowed to offer
health-contingent CSVs, they will choose the CSVs 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) to preempt the settlement firms, which
23
We omit another constraint for no-lapsation: 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) ≡ 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
2 (𝑝2 ) in the formulation of the
problem. Lemma 5 below ensures that this constraint never binds and thus the solution to the problem is not affected
by the omission.
24
The formal statement of this result and its proof are omitted for brevity.

22

prevents the settlement firms from receiving part of the actuarial value 𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) . This in turns
allows the primary insurers to offer reclassification risk insurance for a wider range of period-2
types.
In terms of equilibrium consumer welfare, we have the following unambiguous ranking across
regimes:
Proposition 10. When there is the settlement market, equilibrium consumer welfare is higher (strictly
higher if 𝛽 < 1) when life insurance companies can offer health-contingent CSVs (regime D) than when
they are not allowed to offer CSVs (regime B).
Proposition 11. Equilibrium consumer welfare is lower when there is a settlement market than when
there is no settlement market (regime A, A’ or A”) even if endogenous health-contingent CSVs are allowed
(regime D).
The arguments used in the proofs of both Propositions 10 and 11 are similar to that for Proposition 7: for any contract that is feasible under the “dominated” regime (regime B in Proposition
10 and regime D in Proposition 11), we construct a feasible contract under the “dominant” regime
(regime D in Proposition 10 and regime A in Proposition 11) which offers identical coverage as the
original contract for the “dominated” regime, except for a lower first-period premium. We show
that consumers are weakly better off under the constructed contract.

4.3

Non-Health Contingent CSV with the Settlement Market
Finally, we consider regime C where primary life insurers are only allowed to offer non-health

contingent CSVs in the presence of life settlement firms. That is, we consider a contract space in
the form of ⟨(𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ), {(𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ), 𝑆) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩ where 𝑆 denotes a non-health-contingent
CSV. As we mentioned earlier, the restrictions on CSV to be non-health contingent could result
from explicit government regulations or from the difficulties in enforcing contracts with healthcontingent CSVs. We first state an immediate corollary of Proposition 8:
Corollary 1 (of Proposition 8). In the absence of the settlement market, the primary insurance companies
will set 𝑆 = 0 when they are restricted to offer only non-heath contingent CSV.
When the primary insurance companies face the threat from the settlement market, but are
restricted to react to the threat by offering a non-health contingent CSV, they will choose a contract

23

in the form of ⟨(𝑄1 , 𝐹1 ), {(𝑄2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ), 𝑆) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩ to solve:

where as before 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) ≡ 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) denotes the actuarial value of the policy at period-2
heath state 𝑝2 . To understand the above problem, let us first explain the constraints. Constraint
(34) is the analog of the no-lapsation constraint in this setting, which requires that the actuarial
value of the contract terms for any period-2 health state be at least equal to the CSV. As before,
this requirement reflects the consumer’s inability to commit: if the actuarial value of the contract
was less than the CSV, the consumer would simply surrender the contract and repurchase better
insurance on the spot market. Constraint (35) requires that the CSV 𝑆 be non-negative to reflect
the consumer’s inability to commit to a negative payout in any state. Constraint (36) is the zeroprofit condition reflecting competitiveness of the primary market. The first integral in the right
hand side of (36) is the expected loss the insurance company suffers from consumers who retain
their bequest motive. Constraint (34) implies that for these consumers, the insurance company’s
expected period-2 loss is always equal to 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ). The second integral in the right hand of (36) is the
expected loss the insurance company suffers from consumers who lose their bequest motive and
find it optimal to surrender the policy back to the original insurer (for any of such consumers the
insurance company’s period-2 loss is 𝑆). The third integral is the expected period-2 loss the insurer
suffers from consumers who lose their bequest motive but find it optimal to sell the policy on the
secondary market (for a consumer in this category with health state 𝑝2 , the expected period-2 loss
is 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) for the insurance company).
Now let us explain the objective function. The first integral in (33) is the expected second
period utility to consumers with a bequest motive, for whom constraint (34) ensures that they
remain with the original contract terms; the second integral is the expected second period utility
for consumers who lose their bequest motive, and find it optimal to surrender their contract back

to the insurance company for CSV 𝑆; the third integral is the expected second period utility for
consumers without bequest motive who find it optimal to sell their contract on the settlement
market for payment of 𝛽𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) .
Note that problem (33) is substantially more complicated than problem (29) because now the
policyholders who lose bequest motives need to choose whether to sell the policy to the primary
insurer or the settlement firms. However, using a rather intuitive perturbation argument we can
prove the following somewhat surprising result:
Proposition 12. In the presence of a settlement market, if the primary insurers are restricted to offer only
non-health contingent CSVs, they will choose 𝑆 ∗ = 0 in equilibrium.
To understand the intuition for Proposition 12, it is useful to consider the effect of raising 𝑆
from 0 to 𝜀 on the firm’s second period profits. In Figure 3, the curve labelled 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) depicts
the period-2 actuarial value of the primary insurer’s long-term policy at health state 𝑝2 , and the
curve labelled 𝛽𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) is the settlement firm’s payment for such policies. If the primary insurer
raises the non-health contingent CSV 𝑆 from 0 to 𝜀, policyholders with period 2 health in region
A who no longer have a bequest motive will surrender their policies to the primary insurer for
a payment of 𝜀 > 𝛽𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) . The area labeled A captures the loss in profit from such a change
in the sense that the firm will be paying these consumers 𝜀 under such a change, whereas they
would have would have cost the primary insurer 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ), which is less than 𝜀, before the change.
Policyholders who no longer have bequest motives but with period-2 health state in the region B
will also decide to surrender their policy to the primary insurer instead of selling them to the life
settlement firms because 𝛽𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝜀. For these policyholders the primary insurers were losing
25

𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) before the change, and now are losing only 𝜀. Since 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) > 𝜀 for these policyholders,
area B then represents the gain for the primary insurer’s profit from increasing 𝑆 from 0 to 𝜀.25
As is clear from the graph, area A is first-order proportional to 𝜀, while Area B is second-order
proportional to 𝜀. When 𝜀 is small, the firm’s second period losses increase as a result of increasing
𝑆 from 0 to 𝜀. As a result, the insurance company has to increase the first period premium 𝑄1 to
maintain zero profit. It is easy to see that the utility cost of increasing the first period premium is
exactly 𝜇 ≡ 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄∗1 ) . It turns out that the utility gain for the consumer when 𝑆 increases
from 0 to 𝜀 is captured by (1 − 𝑝1 )𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔)Φ(ˆ
𝑝2 ) where 𝑝ˆ2 is defined by 𝑉2 (ˆ
𝑝2 ) = 𝜀. The marginal
utility gain in the second period is thus smaller than the marginal loss from the increase in the first
period premium, and so this tradeoff is welfare reducing. Similar perturbation argument can be
used to show that marginally decreasing 𝑆 from any positive level is always welfare improving.
Thus the optimal 𝑆 ∗ = 0.
Proposition 12 tells us that when primary insurance companies are restricted to respond to the
threat of the settlement market by optimally choosing non-health contingent CSVs, such an option
is essentially useless. Thus the consumer welfare in regime C is exactly the same as in regime B.
Corollary 2 (to Proposition 12). Equilibrium contracts and consumer welfare are identical under regimes
B and C.

4.4

Summary
Table 2 summarizes our results for consumer welfare ranking under the various market regimes

categorized in Table 1. Proposition 8 and its Corollary 2 imply that when there is no settlement
market, the equilibrium consumer welfare does not depend on whether endogenous cash surrender values are available to the primary insurer. Thus consumer welfare is the same under regimes
A, A’ and A”. Proposition 11 shows that consumer welfare is lower under regime D (with settlement market and endogenous health-contingent CSVs) than regimes A (and A’, A”). Proposition
12 and its Corollary 2 show that consumer welfare is the same under regimes B and C. Finally,
Proposition 10 shows that consumer welfare is higher under regime D than regime B (and thus
C). Table 2 thus summarizes our overall finding that the presence of settlement market unambiguously lowers the equilibrium consumer welfare in our environment, irrespective of what the
primary insurers are allowed to do in response to the settlement firms. In particular, restricting
the primary insurers’ CSVs to be non-health contingent is undesirable for consumers.

Conclusion and Future Research
In this paper, we have examined in detail the effect of the life settlement market on the struc-

ture of the long term contracts offered by the primary insurance market, as well as the effect of
the life settlement market on consumer welfare, using a dynamic model of life insurance with
one sided commitment and bequest-driven lapsation ( à la Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) and Daily,
Hendel and Lizzeri (2008)). We show that the presence of the life settlement market affects the
extent as well as the form of dynamic reclassification risk insurance in the equilibrium of the primary insurance market. In the absence of a life settlement market, reclassification risk insurance is
provided through actuarially favorable level premiums for individuals with second period health
state worse than a threshold 𝑝∗2 . In contrast, when there is a secondary market, reclassification risk
is provided through premium discounts (relative to the actuarially fair premium) for individuals
𝑠∗
∗
whose health is worse than a threshold 𝑝𝑠∗
2 . Moreover, 𝑝2 may be different from 𝑝2 , so reclas-

sification risk insurance may be provided for a smaller set of health realizations when there is a
secondary market. We show that in general, the settlement market always leads to worse consumer welfare than when there is no secondary market (Proposition 7). In the most extreme form,
the presence of the settlement market can completely unravel the dynamic contracts to a sequence
of short-term spot contracts with no dynamic risk classification risk insurance at all (Proposition
6).
We also examine the primary insurers’ response to the settlement market when they can offer
enriched contracts by specifying optimally chosen cash surrender values. We show that when
there are no settlement firms, the primary insurers will not exercise the option of specifying CSVs;
but when there is a threat from settlement firms, primary insurers will choose CSVs to preempt
the settlement market. Allowing for optimally chosen CSVs improves consumer welfare, but consumers are still worse off than if there was no secondary market. We also showed that the option
27

of primary insurers to endogenously choose the CSV is useless if the CSVs are restricted to be
non-health contingent as required by the current regulation. However, if CSVs can be healthcontingent, then the primary insurance companies can partially mitigate the welfare losses induced by the emergence of the settlement market (see Table 2).
Directions for Future Research.

There are several important venues for further research. First,

this paper, as well as Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008), studies the effects of life settlement markets when life insurance policy lapsation is driven only by the loss of bequest motives. Selling of
life insurance policies could, however, be a result of large income losses (or equivalently expense
increase), as is the case for the viatical market for AIDS patients, as well as the story reported in
the Wall Street Journal. In a companion paper, Fang and Kung (2010a), we consider a model of
life insurance market that explicitly features both income and mortality risks and examine the effects of life settlement market on consumer welfare when policyholders’ lapsation could be driven
by income shocks. The life settlement market allows life insurance policies to be used as an instrument for consumption smoothing when the policyholder experiences a large negative income
shock. Because payments received from life settlement firms (or from cash surrender values of the
primary insurer) in such low income states have a large marginal value, the life settlement market
can indeed make consumers better off. We also find that, when lapsations are driven by income
shocks, the welfare effects of the settlement market depend on what other consumption smoothing instruments are available to the consumers, and whether they are allowed to hold multiple
policies.
The theoretical analysis thus establishes that the welfare effects of life settlement market depends on why policyholders lapse. If policyholders lapse only because of their loss of bequest
motives, then we have shown in this paper that the settlement market is bad for consumers. However, if lapsations are driven by income shocks, then our companion paper Fang and Kung (2010a)
shows that settlement market may improve consumer welfare. Therefore, it is crucially important
to empirically understand why policyholders lapse their policies. Surprisingly, to the best of our
knowledge, there has been no formal empirical analysis of this issue in the literature. In Fang and
Kung (2010b), we use data from the HRS to estimate a dynamic structural model of life insurance
purchase, renewal, and lapsation. We then use these estimates to disentangle the contributions of
health shocks, income shocks and bequest motive shocks to the observed lapsation of life insurance policies.
It is also interesting to empirically test the models’ predictions of how the primary insurance
market responds to the threat from the settlement market. For example, Proposition 3 showed
that level term life insurance policies are no longer optimal. Propositions 10 and 12 showed that
primary insurers should have incentives to offer health-contingent CSVs in response to the set28

tlement market, but a non-health contingent CSV is of no use. Do we see these developments in
the primary market? It is also interesting to examine the model’s prediction of who will sell life
insurance to the settlement firms. For example, in the current model, only those with no bequest
motives but with bad health (whose original life insurance policy has strictly positive actuarial
value) will sell to settlement firms. Does the evidence support this prediction?

Proof of Lemma 1:
Proof. If 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ and 𝑝′2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ, the complementary slackness conditions (5) implies that 𝜆(𝑝2 ) ≤ 0
and 𝜆(𝑝′2 ) = 0. First order conditions (4c) for 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) and 𝑄2 (𝑝′2 ) and 𝑝′ then imply:
𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 )) = 𝜇 +

(1 − 𝑝1 )𝑞𝜙(𝑝2 )

Since 𝑢′ is decreasing, it must be that 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑄2 (𝑝′2 ). The full event insurance conditions (6a)
and (6b) then imply that 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) ≥ 𝐹2 (𝑝′2 ) .
To prove that 𝑝2 < 𝑝′2 , suppose to the contrary. Since 𝑝′2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ implies that 𝑄2 (𝑝′2 ) < 𝑝′2 𝐹2 (𝑝′2 ),
we have
𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑄2 (𝑝′2 ) < 𝑝′2 𝐹2 (𝑝′2 ) ≤ 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 )
where the last inequality follows from postulated 𝑝2 ≥ 𝑝′2 , and the fact that 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) ≥ 𝐹2 (𝑝′2 )
established above. Thus, 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ), a contradiction to 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ.

Proof of Lemma 2:
Proof. Suppose 𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 ) < 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 ). Since ⟨𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 ) , 𝐹2 (𝑝∗2 )⟩ must satisfy the full-event insurance
condition (6b), we have 𝐹2 (𝑝∗2 ) > 𝐹2𝐹 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 ) . Thus, 𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 ) − 𝑝∗2 𝐹2 (𝑝∗2 ) < 0, hence 𝑝∗2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ. Therefore, 𝜆 (𝑝∗2 ) = 0 and thus the first order conditions (4) imply that
𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 )) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ).

(A1)

But for all 𝑝2 < 𝑝∗2 , we already established that 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) = 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝2 ) and 𝜆 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 0, thus
lim 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 )) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 )) ≤ 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ).

(A2)

(A1) and (A2) imply that 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 )) ≤ 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 )), hence 𝑄2 (𝑝∗2 ) ≥ 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 ), a
contradiction.
To prove (12), suppose instead 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝∗2 )) < 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ). Because 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (⋅) is continuous, there must exist 𝑝ˆ2 > 𝑝∗2 such that 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (ˆ
𝑝2 )) < 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ). Since by Lemma
1, 𝑝ˆ2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ, it must be that 𝑄2 (ˆ
𝑝2 ) < 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (ˆ
𝑝2 ). Thus 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (ˆ
𝑝2 )) < 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (ˆ
𝑝2 )) <
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ), a contradiction to 𝑝ˆ2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ.

Proof of Proposition 2:
ˆ 1 ≥ 𝑄1 . Then the concavity of 𝑢 implies that 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄
ˆ 1) ≥
Proof. Let 𝑞ˆ > 𝑞 and suppose 𝑄
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ). Lemma 2 then implies that:26

𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (ˆ

Since 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (⋅) is increasing in its argument, we thus have 𝑝ˆ∗2 ≥ 𝑝∗ . This in turn implies that 𝑄
ˆ 2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹ˆ2 (𝑝2 ) ≥ 𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) for all
𝑄2 (𝑝2 ) and 𝐹ˆ2 (𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 . Hence 0 ≥ 𝑄
𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]. Hence, if 𝑝∗2 < 1, we must have:

Proof of Lemma 3:
Proof. If 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ 𝑠 and 𝑝′2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 , then 𝜆(𝑝2 ) ≤ 0 and 𝜆(𝑝′2 ) = 0, and 𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) = 0 and 𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝′2 ) > 0.
The first order conditions (18c) corresponding to heath states 𝑝2 and 𝑝′2 imply that
(1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔) ≤ (1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝′2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝′2 )).
Since 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔) > 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝′2 )), the above inequality can hold only if 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝′2 ).
To prove that 𝑝2 < 𝑝′2 , suppose to the contrary that 𝑝2 ≥ 𝑝′2 . Then note that 𝑝′2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 implies
that 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝′2 ) < 𝑝′2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝′2 ); hence
𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝′2 ) < 𝑝′2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝′2 ) ≤ 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ),
where the last inequality because 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) ≥ 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝′2 ) which follows from 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝′2 ) and the
fact that full-event insurance requires that face amount decreases with premium. Hence 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) <
𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ), contradicting the assumption that 𝑝2 ∈ ℬ 𝑠 .
Proof of Lemma 4:
Proof. The structure of the proof is similar to that for Proposition 2. Suppose that 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝𝑠∗
2 ) <

Thus the first order conditions imply:

contradicting that 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ for all 𝑝2 > 𝑝𝑠∗
2 .
Proof of Proposition 3:
Proof. The first assertion directly follows from the fact that 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 if 𝑝2 > 𝑝𝑠∗
2 . To show that

𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) increases in 𝑝2 for 𝑝2 > 𝑝𝑠∗
2 , note that from the first order conditions (18), 𝐹2 (𝑝2 ) and

𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) must satisfy, for all 𝑝2 > 𝑝∗2 the following system:
(1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ),
𝑣 ′ (𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )),
𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) = 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ).
Taking derivatives with respect to 𝑝2 for each equation, we obtain:

Proof of Proposition 6:
Proof. If 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 is not empty, then for any 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 , from first order conditions (18) the contract
terms must satisfy:
(1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) = 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ),

(A7)

which can be rewritten as:
(1 − 𝑞) [𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 ))] = 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 )).

(A8)

First note that the zero-profit condition (16) implies that if 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 is not empty, then it must be the
case that 𝑄𝑠1 ≥ 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 > 0, where 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 denotes the actuarially fair premium for period-1 full event
〈
〉
insurance. Specifically, 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 , 𝐹1𝐹 𝐼 are implicitly defined by the unique solution to the following
system of equations:
(
)
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 ) = 𝑣 ′ 𝐹1𝐹 𝐼
𝑄𝐹1 𝐼

= 𝑝1 𝐹1𝐹 𝐼 .

Notice that 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 does not depend on 𝑞, but it is decreasing in 𝑔. Let 𝑔¯ be the upper-bound of the
values that 𝑔 can take, and let 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 > 0 denotes the actuarially fair full-insurance premium at
𝑔 = 𝑔¯. Thus 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 ≥ 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 for all 𝑔. Therefore the right hand side (RHS) of (A8) is bounded below,
for any 𝑔 > 0, by:
𝑅𝐻𝑆 > 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 ) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦) .
Now examine the left hand side (LHS) of (A8). We will consider two cases. For the first
case, suppose that lim𝑥→0 𝑢′ (𝑥) ≡ 𝑢′ (0) < ∞. Because 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) is always smaller than 𝑦 + 𝑔 in
equilibrium, we have that
𝐿𝐻𝑆 = 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝)) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝)) < 𝑢′ (0) .
Thus if
𝑞 < 𝑞ˆ =

𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 ) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦)
𝑢′ (0)

,

then the LHS of (A8) will always be smaller than its RHS; i.e., equation (A7) can never be satisfied
for any 𝑝2 . Thus, 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 must be empty.
For the second case, suppose that lim𝑥→0 𝑢′ (𝑥) = ∞. Since 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 , we have 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 ) −

35

𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) > 0. Plugging (21) into the above inequality, we obtain:
𝑝2 𝑣 ′−1 (𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ))) > 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ),
or equivalently,

(A10)

Notice that the LHS of (A10) is increasing as 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) varies from 0 to 𝑦 + 𝑔, and that its RHS is
decreasing in 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) over the same interval. If 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔) ≥ 𝑣 ′ (0) then (A10) cannot be satisfied
for any value of 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝) and hence𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 must be empty. Thus we can without loss of generality
consider the case that 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔) < 𝑣 ′ (0). Since we are now considering the case in which 𝑢′ (0) =
∞, we know that at 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝) = 𝑦 + 𝑔, LHS of (A10) is 𝑢′ (0) > 𝑣 ′ ((𝑦 + 𝑔)/𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 . Because
LHS of (A10) is continuous and monotonically increasing in 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) , while the RHS of (A10) is
continuous and monotonically decreasing in 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) , there must exist, for each 𝑝2 ∈ 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 some
𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔) < 𝑦 + 𝑔 such that 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔)) = 𝑣 ′ (𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔) /𝑝), and hence 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝) must be bounded
above by 𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔) . Moreover, note that, for all 𝑔, it can be easily shown that 𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔) is increasing
in 𝑝2 . Thus we can write sup𝑝2 ∈𝒩 ℬ𝑠 𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔) = 𝑥 (1; 𝑔) ≡ 𝑥 (𝑔) < 𝑦 + 𝑔, for all 𝑔. Now denote
𝑢
¯′ ≡ max𝑔 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑥(𝑔)) < ∞. We hence have
𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) < 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 )) < 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑥(𝑝2 ; 𝑔))
≤ 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑥(𝑔)) ≤ 𝑢
¯′ ,
where the second inequality follows from 𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) < 𝑥 (𝑝2 ; 𝑔) ; the third inequality follows from
𝑥 (𝑝2 , 𝑔) ≤ 𝑥 (𝑔) , and the last inequality follows from 𝑢
¯′ ≡ max𝑔 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑥(𝑔)). Thus, if
𝑞 < 𝑞ˆ ≡

𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑄𝐹1 𝐼 ) − 𝛽𝑢′ (𝑦)
𝑢

,

then the LHS of (A8) will always be smaller than its RHS; i.e., equation (A7) can never be satisfied
for any 𝑝2 . Thus, 𝒩 ℬ 𝑠 must be empty.

Now let 𝐶 𝑠 be the equilibrium contract in the presence of the settlement market. The above argument shows that the contract 𝐶ˆ constructed through a simple reduction of first period premium
is feasible for the problem without the settlement market; and 𝐶ˆ provides weakly (or strictly, if
38

𝐶 𝑠 offers some dynamic insurance) higher expected utility to the consumers for the case without
settlement market than 𝐶 𝑠 would provide for consumers with settlement market. Because 𝐶ˆ is
only a candidate contract for the case without settlement market, the equilibrium contract in that

where 𝛾 (𝑝2 ) is the Lagrange multiplier for constraint (32).
From these conditions, we see that constraint (32) must bind for all 𝑝2 because otherwise, 𝛾(𝑝2 )

Proof. We consider two cases. For the first case, suppose that 𝑄𝑠1 ≤ 𝑄𝑠𝑠
1 . Then we have, from
𝑠𝑠
the full-event insurance condition, 𝑄𝑠1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1𝑠 ≤ 𝑄𝑠𝑠
1 − 𝑝1 𝐹1 . From Lemma 5, we know that in

equilibrium 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) = 𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) . Thus the zero profit conditions imply that:
∫

𝑉2𝑠 (𝑝2 )𝑑Φ(𝑝2 )

∫
≤

(1 −

𝑞) 𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 )

+

𝛽𝑞𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 )𝑑Φ(𝑝2 )

39

∫
≤

𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 )𝑑Φ(𝑝2 ).

So there must exist 𝑝˜2 such that 𝑉2𝑠 (˜
𝑝2 ) ≤ 𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (˜
𝑝2 ) and 𝑄𝑠2 (˜
𝑝2 ) ≥ 𝑄𝑠𝑠
𝑝2 ). At such a 𝑝˜2 , the following
2 (˜
must hold:
(1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (˜
𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠 (˜
𝑝2 ))
≥ (1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 + 𝛽𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (˜
𝑝2 ))
2 (˜
Now from the first order conditions for problem (15) detailed in (18), the left hand side of the
above inequality is equal to 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ); and the right hand side, from the first order conditions
for problem (29), is large than [(1 − 𝑞) + 𝛽𝑞] 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
1 ). That is,
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠1 ) ≥ [(1 − 𝑞) + 𝛽𝑞] 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
1 ).
𝑠𝑠∗
27
Now, Lemma 4 for 𝑝𝑠∗
2 and the analogous lemma for 𝑝2 imply that:
′
′
𝐹 𝐼 𝑠𝑠∗
′
(1 − 𝑞) 𝑢′ (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄𝐹2 𝐼 (𝑝𝑠∗
2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢 (𝑦 + 𝑔) ≥ (1 − 𝑞) 𝑢 (𝑦 + 𝑔 − 𝑄2 (𝑝2 )) + 𝛽𝑞𝑢 (𝑦 + 𝑔).
𝑠𝑠∗
Hence, 𝑝𝑠∗
2 ≥ 𝑝2 .

For the second case, suppose 𝑄𝑠1 > 𝑄𝑠𝑠
1 . Then:
′
𝑠𝑠
𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ) > 𝑢′ (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
1 ) ≥ [(1 − 𝑞) + 𝛽𝑞] 𝑢 (𝑦 − 𝑔 − 𝑄1 ).
𝑠𝑠∗
Then identical argument as the step immediately above implies that 𝑝𝑠∗
2 > 𝑝2 .

Proof Proposition 10:
Proof. Let the equilibrium in regime B be denoted by 𝐶 𝑠 = ⟨(𝑄𝑠1 , 𝐹1𝑠 ), {(𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ), 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )) : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}⟩ .

The analogous lemma for 𝑝𝑠𝑠∗
is omitted from the text for brevity. It states that under regime D, the equilibrium

contract at 𝑝2 = 𝑝𝑠𝑠∗
satisfies:

In contrast, 𝑄𝑠1 in 𝐶 𝑠 must satisfy the zero-profit condition (16), which implies that:
𝑄𝑠1 = 𝑝1 𝐹1𝑠 + (1 − 𝑝1 )

∫

{𝑄𝑠2 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠 (𝑝2 )} 𝑑Φ(𝑝2 ).

market. As Lemma 5 shows, 𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) = 𝛽𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) ≡ 𝑝2 𝐹2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) − 𝑄𝑠𝑠
2 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 . Thus, the
zero-profit condition implies:

A (the case without a secondary market), but outside the feasible set for regime D.
We will now show that 𝐶ˆ in a world without secondary market provides consumers with
higher welfare than 𝐶 𝑠𝑠 does in a world with secondary market. To see this, let

denote the expected consumer welfare associated with contract 𝐶ˆ in regime A. Note that since
𝑆 𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) = 𝛽𝑉2𝑠𝑠 (𝑝2 ) for all 𝑝2 , all of the equations in the proof of Proposition 7 hold until we reach

where {𝜆(𝑝2 ) ≤ 0 : 𝑝2 ∈ [0, 1]}, 𝛾 ≥ 0, 𝜇 ≥ 0 are respectively the Lagrange multiplier for constraints (34), (35), and (36).
Using standard arguments, we can show that under the optimum, 𝑉2 (⋅) must be continuous
and monotonically increasing in 𝑝2 , with 𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) > 0 for some 𝑝2 if there is some dynamic reclassification risk insurance in equilibrium. Thus we know that for every 𝑆 ≥ 0 with 𝑆 sufficiently
small, there exists a 𝑝ˆ2 such that 𝛽𝑉2 (𝑝2 ) ≥ 𝑆 if and only if 𝑝2 ≥ 𝑝ˆ2 where 𝛽𝑉2 (ˆ
𝑝2 ) = 𝑆. Thus from

The same argument can be used to show that if the optimal 𝑆 ∗ was strictly positive, a deviation of
