ABSTRACT
Perhaps because health care is a local service sector, health economists have paid little attention to
international linkages between domestic health care economies. However, the growth in domestic
health care sectors is often attributed to medical innovations whose returns are earned worldwide.
Because world returns drive innovation and innovation is central to spending growth, spending growth
in a given country is thereby highly affected by health care economies and policies of other countries.
This paper analyzes the unique positive and normative implications of these innovation-induced linkages
across countries when governments centrally price health care. Providing world returns to medical
innovation under such central pricing involves a public-goods problem; the taxation to fund reimbursements
involves a private domestic cost with an international benefit of medical innovation. This has the direct
normative implication that medical innovations have inefficiently low world returns. It also has the
positive implication that reimbursements in one country depend negatively on those of others; reimbursements
are “strategic substitutes” through free riding. Because reimbursements are strategic substitutes, world
concentration of health care is a significant issue. A small European country has no access-innovation
trade-off in its pricing; it will have low reimbursements because it does not affect world returns and
sees the same innovations regardless of its reimbursement policy. The public-goods problem of innovation
thereby implies that the United States, despite being the world’s largest buyer, will pay the highest
reimbursements. This problem also implies that free riding counteracts the standard positive impact
of larger world markets on innovation when health care concentration falls. Indeed, currently, health
care is highly concentrated; about half of world health care spending occurs in the United States, despite
that fact that it makes up only about one-fifth of the world economy. We assess the effect that emerging
markets will have on this concentration and thus world returns. We use pharmaceutical reimbursement
data from 1996–2010 to provide IV estimates of the degree to which domestic reimbursements are
strategic substitutes. We find that these estimates imply that world returns from innovation may actually
fall from a growth in “market size” of BRICS countries as a result of increased free riding in non-BRICS
countries. The overall analysis has important positive implications for spending patterns across countries
as well as normative implications for evaluating domestic or regional health care reforms.

Section 1: Introduction
Perhaps because health care is primarily a local service industry, health economists
have paid relatively little attention to international trade issues. Nevertheless, the health
economics research community holds the widespread belief that medical innovation is a
central force behind the worldwide growth of spending (Newhouse, 1992). Today, most
countries are spending on technologies, or physician‐ and hospital services connected to
those technologies, unavailable just a few years ago. Reimbursements, either direct or
indirect, create the incentive to innovate. Payments for pharmaceuticals would be an
example of a direct reimbursement, while payments to hospitals or doctors for devices
used in patient care would be an example of an indirect reimbursement.
However, it is well understood that research and development (R&D) in general and
medical innovation in particular are driven by world returns rather than returns of a given
domestic market. For example, Swedish medical product firms innovate to sell worldwide
not just to their own small population. Because world returns drive innovation and are
central to health care spending growth, it follows that a given country’s spending growth is
driven by health care economies and policies of other countries. As such, spending growth
in a small European country currently depends on how US policies affect world returns,
just as future Medicare spending will depend on how emerging markets will affect those
returns. However, health economists have conducted little explicit analysis on how health
care policies in one country affect or should affect those of another. This paper analyzes the
positive and normative implications of these innovation‐induced linkages between
domestic health care economies and centrally set reimbursement policies.
We argue that domestic governments’ centralized pricing of much of health care has
some unique implications for determining world returns and the innovation‐induced
spending growth those returns imply. In particular, the act of setting reimbursement
policies for providers and manufacturers, whether by allowing private pricing or public
reimbursements, creates a public‐goods problem in generating world returns to medical
innovation. Taxation to fund the reimbursements to the health care industry involves a
2

private cost with a worldwide benefit through innovation. It follows directly that if medical
innovation benefits all countries, a given country under‐reimburses providers and
manufacturers as a result of its positive external effect on others. Thus, there will be too
little medical innovation as it will not be sufficiently rewarded by world returns.
A key positive implication of this public‐goods problem is that profit‐provision
through reimbursements in a given country is negatively correlated with the profit
provision of other countries; that is, reimbursements will be “strategic substitutes.” A small
European country may reimburse less generously because the United States reimburses
more generously. More precisely, we argue that the smaller the share of world demand and
supply a country makes up, the less that governments will mark up prices above cost to
promote innovation. Put differently, a small country has nothing to gain from raising its
reimbursements, as it will see the same flow of new innovations regardless of what it does.
We therefore predict that European countries will have lower payments and
reimbursements than the United States, despite the latter being the larger buyer. This may
be reflected in relatively lower European reimbursements for doctor and hospital services
that cover innovations such as devices or drugs or for medical products directly through
reference pricing or cost‐effectiveness threshold policies.2
We analyze how changes in both worldwide demand and supply drive world returns
when reimbursements are strategic substitutes. We predict that the concentration of
aggregate demand and supply across the world has implications for medical innovation.
These concentration effects have nonstandard consequences for the future of medical
innovation and world spending growth. For example, future growth in world demand from
the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (or BRICS), despite
recent slowdowns, will lower world concentration of aggregate demand and supply by
making the United States less dominant. We predict that this will lead to lower US
reimbursements when it loses it dominant role in world returns. In general, growth in

effectiveness standards implies.

world markets may have two offsetting effects on innovation: the standard positive effect
from an increase in world market size, and the offsetting negative effect due to increased
free riding when world concentration in health care falls.
We provide empirical evidence of these effects by analyzing the impact of the
growth of BRICS on future world returns and. In doing so, we provide some basic facts on
world concentration in health care, including the degree to which the share of the world
supply of medical products from BRICS has risen relative to their share of world demand.
We then use pharmaceutical reimbursement data from 26 developed countries over the
past 15 years to provide instrumental variable (IV) estimates of the degree to which
reimbursements are strategic substitutes to demand and supply conditions of other
countries.
We use these IV estimates to assess the impact on world returns of a diminishing
concentration created by the growth of BRICS. A back‐of‐the‐envelope calculation
illustrates that the markup reductions in the United States and other countries do not have
to be large to offset predicted growth rates in demand from BRICS. Currently, the BRICS
contribute approximately 7% to world spending in health care. If by current industry
estimates, such as that of IMS Health3, their spending grew 20% in the next three years,
they would still make up only about 8.28% of world spending. This implies that a decrease
in markups of only 1.5% in non‐BRICS countries would be enough to offset this 20%
growth from BRICS. The small reduction in markups needed to offset the substantial
spending growth from the BRICS is due to the substantial concentration in world health
care spending. Our estimates of the size of the strategic substitutability in reimbursements
suggest that under reasonable conditions, when world concentration of health care supply
and demand falls, the growth in BRICS market size may lower medical innovation returns
as a result of declines in reimbursements in the United States and other rich countries.

3

This is the suggested growth rate in industry publications, see e.g. IMS Institute’s “The Global Use of
Medicines Outlook Through 2016”

Our analysis relates to several other strands of work. Becker et al. (2005)
documented that medical innovation in rich countries greatly affected health outcomes in
poor countries and reduced world inequality. Hult and Philipson (2012) considered the
impact of domestic, rather than international, reimbursement policies on innovation
incentives. Lakdawalla et al. (2009) simulated the impact of US pharmaceutical pricing
policies on both US and European health outcomes. Danzon (1997) discussed how to
efficiently raise a given amount of pharmaceutical R&D across regions through Ramsey
pricing. This research differs from our strategic analysis, wherein positive and normative
implications stem from inefficiencies in the public‐goods provision of world returns.4 Our
analysis also relates to a large literature comparing domestic health care economies (see,
e.g., Gerdtham and Jönsson, 2000), which does not consider the innovation‐induced
linkages across countries we discuss here.
The overall point of our analysis is to analyze how international linkages affect both
positive and normative analyses of domestic health care policies. On a positive level, these
linkages seem to be important for explaining differences in European and US
reimbursement policies and hence spending differences; on a normative level, they are
important for evaluating the effects and desirability of domestic health care reforms aimed
at curbing domestic spending growth resulting from world returns.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a theoretical examination of
the implications of the innovation‐induced linkages among domestic reimbursement
policies. Section 3 provides our empirical analysis of strategic substitutability and the
impact of the BRICS on future world returns. Section 4 concludes and discusses future
research, including the limited value of regional‐ or state‐level reimbursement experiments
in examining spending growth induced by world returns.

In addition their analysis implies the central importance of the price‐elasticity of medical product demand in
efficiently raising a given amount of R&D, which is less relevant when reimbursements are centrally set and
publicly financed in which case the excess burden of taxation is the dead weight loss of interest.

Section 2: The Public Goods Problem of Providing World Returns to Innovation
We first lay out the framework considered for the public goods problem of
providing world returns for medical innovation. The key issue is that protecting innovator
profits through higher public reimbursements involves private cost for a country, but this
provision has positive external effects to other countries by promoting innovation.
Therefore, public reimbursements will be under‐provided by countries acting in their own
interest compared to efficient world returns and reimbursements will be strategic
substitutes.
Consider when the amount of R&D affects the probability of discovery of a medical
innovation according to

where

is increasing and concave. If

are the

world profits aggregated up over K countries then the R&D that maximizes expected profits
can be written as
discovery

. This implies that the induced probability of
is increasing in world profits .

Each country provides profits

and has its own welfare

which is decreasing

in profit provision given the excess burden of the taxes financing reimbursements. The
world expected social welfare across all countries is

Within a given country, providing profits is a private bad that enables the public good of
world returns to innovation. The socially efficient profit provision of each country
therefore satisfies a classic public good condition that the private cost of raising
reimbursement is equated to the value to the world of raising innovative returns
(1)

6

This efficient provision of profits differs from the privately optimal (Nash equilibrium)
provision which only takes into account how the country’s costly profit provision affects its
own welfare
(2)
Thus, the private innovation benefit to a given country is smaller than the social benefit to
all countries so that world returns to medical innovation are under‐provided by countries
when acting in their own interest. In other words, the Nash equilibrium of profit provision
has world returns to innovation below the efficient level5.
This public goods problem of providing world returns alters standard arguments
about the classic effects of market size on innovation. In particular, the public goods
problem may counteract the canonical positive effect that a growth of world markets has
on innovative returns. To see this in its simplest form, consider when there are K
homogeneous countries with the same domestic profits

. An increase in the number of

countries may be interpreted as the rise in “profitable” countries for which demand is
above variable costs, such e.g. the growth of world demand through the BRICS. The FOC for
privately optimal profit provision in this case implies

Under regularity conditions6 this implies free‐riding in the sense that that domestic profits
fall with the number of countries that contribute to world profits;
are

. World returns

and thus there are two effects of a growth in world market size on world

returns

More precisely, for any profit level
the marginal cost of profit provision (
) is the same under
socially optimal and privately optimal setting; However, for any profit level , the marginal benefit of profit
provision is greater under the socially optimal framework than the privately optimal framework
. Consequently, profits are underprovided in the privately optimal setting.

Sufficient but not necessary conditions for

are that

7

This says that the first standard positive effect of market size on innovative returns is
mitigated by the second negative effect induced by increased free‐riding when a larger
group of countries provides the public good of medical innovation. In the extreme case
when US or a single country is the only champion of medical innovative returns, K=1, world
returns are efficient. As income growth in the BRICS makes them profitable for the
innovation, K rises and the overall impact on world returns is a horse race between larger
world markets and smaller US markups.
To illustrate, consider when domestic welfare is given by the first‐order Taylor
and world returns affects innovation according to

. If there is only one country, the socially efficient and Nash

equilibrium profit levels coincide. When more than one country contributes to world
profits,

, world returns are too low in the sense that the efficient level of profits are

under‐provision occurs because each country fails to consider the external benefit of profit
provision when determining its price setting policies. Consequently, when the benefit of the
innovation in other countries falls (from either a decrease in

or an increase in

) or the

number of countries decreases, the free riding problem shrinks.
We can allow heterogeneous countries by writing the welfare generated by the
innovation in a particular country as a function of domestic demand factors,
country’s ownership share of global profits,

Here

, and the

as in

reflects the decreasing consumer welfare to the country’s population as a

function of profit provision. Generalizing the example from above, the vector

includes

both domestic factors that increase the domestic value of the innovation such as
population, per capita income, or disease prevalence related to the innovation as well as
the cost of raising taxes to reimburse for the innovation. The second component of welfare
represents the benefit to domestic owners of the innovation.
Since the reimbursement policy set by each country depends on total world profits,
each country’s reimbursement policy is a function of other countries reimbursement
policies. This is the key international linkage in reimbursement levels. More precisely,
totally differentiating the FOC for the privately optimal profit provision with respect to
another country’s profits

yields

It can be shown that under the maintained regularity conditions profit provisions are
“strategic substitutes” in the sense that8

Sufficient but not necessary conditions for profits provisions being strategic substitutes are that
is
is decreasing and concave in profits, and
increasing and concave in total profits,
The last assumption holds trivially provided no countries profit share exceeds 0.50 as the marginal cost of
profit provision, in terms of profits, is greater than 1.

If one country’s reimbursement policy raises its contribution to world returns, other
countries respond by reducing their profit levels. However, an increase in Country j’s
profits leads to less than one for one decrease in Country k’s profits such total world profits
increase overall.
Figure 1 illustrates the best response functions in a heterogeneous two region case
as, say, the US and the BRICS. The Nash equilibrium profit levels are characterized at the
point at which the two best response functions intersect. The negative slope of the best
response functions in the Figure corresponds to that strategic substitutability of profits;
one country prefers to contribute less to world returns the more other countries
contribute. The Nash equilibrium provision of profits is less than the socially efficient
provision of profits to the northeast of the Nash profits.

10

FIGURE 1: BEST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS AND EQUILIBRIUM

The general result that centrally determined reimbursements are strategic
substitutes differs from other predictions without world returns being a public good. First,
standard theories of optimal privately determined monopoly pricing across regions imply
that the demand elasticity of a given country govern its own price, and thus does not
depend on factors of other countries. Second, explanations of national prices based on
government monopsony power yield different implications than ours because such
explanations imply larger economies have lower, not higher, prices. To illustrate, the fact
that the US government has greater centralized bargaining power than smaller European
countries but have larger markups in its reimbursements is consistent with the public
goods interpretation discussed here.
A second general result is that the concentration of ownership does not affect the
efficient level of profits but will affect the Nash equilibrium profits. This follows
11

immediately from that aggregate welfare does not depend on the concentration of
ownership

Therefore, the efficient levels of profits are independent of what country owns them.
To illustrate the heterogeneous case, consider again the parametric P‐function and
the Taylor approximations of welfare

The socially efficient level of profits are calculated, without loss in generality, under the assumption

. Note that, as discussed, unlike the privately

optimal equilibrium level, the efficient level of profits does not depend on the distribution
of ownership.
2.1 The Effect of Domestic Demand Growth
To assess the impact of growth in world demand for an innovation, consider the FOC
for privately optimal profit provision
(3)
Under the conditions that
condition that

is decreasing and concave in profits and the additional

, it can easily be shown that the best response function is of profit

provision is strictly increasing in the demand parameter ,

12.

The condition,

states that the social cost of transferring surplus to producers is not increasing in
population size; it’s cheaper for a larger population to provide the same level of profits to
the innovator as per‐capita taxes are lower.
As illustrated in Figure 2, consider the scenario where demand growth in Country 1
(say the BRICS) increases from

to

. For any given level of profits allocated by Country

2, Country 1 will find it optimal to now set a higher profit level due to its increase in
demand. Consequently, Country 1’s best response function,
outwards to

, will shift

. The unilateral response arrow in the Figure indicates the change

in total profits resulting from the demand growth keeping Country 2’s profit level fixed.
However, since prices are strategic substitutes across countries, both Country 2 and
Country 1 strategically respond according to their best response functions such that the
equilibrium level of profits shifts to the intersection of the best response curves

12

Total differentiating first order condition (3) with respect to

and

. Although profits increase overall from

to

, the

equilibrium response arrow in the Figure indicates how total profits decrease relative to
that indicated by the initial unilateral response of Country 1 due to strategic responses of
the two countries. The main point is that since prices are strategic substitutes, Country 2
(say the US) “free‐rides” off the larger profits provided by Country 1 by lowering its own
profit level. Although total profits increase overall, Country 2 sets a lower domestic profit
level in the new equilibrium. The strategic profit response by Country 2 will partially but
not fully offset the increase in the profits set by Country 1 such that total world profits
increase overall.
FIGURE 2: THE EFFECT OF A DOMESTIC DEMAND INCREASE

This Figure illustrates two more general implications. First, an increase in domestic
demand growth leads to higher domestic profits;

. Second, the strategic profit

14

response of other countries will at least partially and could potentially fully offset the
entire increase in profits stemming from the domestic demand growth 13 .

An illustrative case of this offset is that when demand growth in the BRICS occurs, US
reimbursements may fall as US becomes one of many providing world returns to
innovation.
2.2 The Effects of Changes in Ownership of Innovative Returns
Now consider the impact on world returns when changes in ownership of those
returns shift across countries. Just as domestic demand growth increases the benefit of the
innovation and consequently the country’s optimal level of profit provision, the
reimbursement level of a country will be a positive function of how much of world profits is
owned by that country. Implicitly differentiating the FOC for privately optimal profit
provision as before, it can easily be shown that a country’s optimal profit level will be a
positive function of how much of global profits it owns ;

14.

However, an increase in

one country’s profit share implies a decline in another country’s share. Consequently, any
change in ownership shares (

) are zero sum and results in that profits are

protected more in countries that gain in ownership and less in countries that do not. The
implied change in total world returns is

second country own less of the world returns, its best response function shifts inward. The
net effect on aggregate profits of a shift in profits is ambiguous and depends on the
curvature of the welfare‐ and probability of discovery function.
FIGURE 3: THE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP

The general point illustrated by the two country example is that changes in
ownership shares has indeterminate effects on world returns;

may be positive or
16

negative (The Appendix derives how welfare, , and the probability of innovation,

affect the impact of changes in ownership on world returns).
Section 3: Empirical Analysis
Our empirical analysis documents the concentration in world health care spending,
provides IV‐estimates of the strategic substitutability in reimbursement and uses those
estimates to assess the degree to which demand growth from the BRICS will impact world
innovative returns. The descriptive statistics discussed includes overall health care
spending but the estimation is done for reimbursements for pharmaceuticals.
3.1 World Trends in Concentration of Health Care
3.1.1 Trends in Concentration of Health care and Pharmaceutical Expenditures.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize world health care and pharmaceutical expenditures for
the largest countries by health care and pharmaceutical expenditure shares. The health
care expenditure, GDP and population data come from the World Bank DataBank.
Pharmaceutical expenditure data for OECD and BRICS countries is compiled from the OECD
iLibrary and the National Health Accounts database at the World Health Organization15
(WHO) respectively 16. GDP and expenditure data for all of the countries are measured in
constant US Dollars (base year=2000).
Even though health economists often debate numbers such as the share of GDP of a
country spent on health care, or total spending given per capita by income levels, what
matters for innovation incentives are more tied to aggregate world market shares. Our data
We would like to thank Richard Liang at the WHO for giving us the BRICS pharmaceutical expenditure time
series data.

15

Note that we use the National Health Accounts and OECD data to compute pharmaceutical expenditure
shares rather than the more commonly quoted IMS data. The IMS pharmaceutical data consists of
“manufacturers sales to wholesalers and hospitals as well as retail sales of prescription medicine” (World
Health Organization 2004). The NHA and OECD data uses a broader definition of health care expenditures
than IMS; for example IMS data does not include over the counter medicine sales. Consequently, the NHA data
indicates higher pharmaceutical expenditure shares in developing countries than the IMS data.
16

17

indicates that currently the US remains the champion of both overall health care and
pharmaceutical expenditures, accounting for about 50% of the world market share for
health care and 40% of world pharmaceutical share. However, despite recent slowdowns,
the projected surge in health care expenditures in BRICS and other countries may diminish
this concentration in spending in the global health care economy.
Although the health care spending in the US and other developed countries
dominates the current level of spending in the BRICS countries, over the period 1995‐2010
BRICS overall health care expenditures grew at twice the rate of the world health care
expenditures. In terms of its share of total world health expenditures, the BRICS countries
growth has come not at the expense of the US but at the expense of the other large
countries (i.e. Japan, France and Germany). As the BRICS country with both the largest
overall health care sector as well as pharmaceutical sector, China is the driving force
behind BRICS health care spending growth in terms of both growth rates and levels.
Despite similar population sizes, China spends four times as much on health care than India
and China’s spending growth continues to outpace India’s by 4.60%17.

Over the period 2005 through 2006, health care expenditures grew at an average annual rate of 12.88%
and 8.28% in China and India respectively.

 (*) Measured in 2000 constant US Dollars.

 Pharmaceutical expenditure data for OECD and BRICS countries is compiled from the OECD iLibrary
and WHO National Health Accounts respectively.

Contrasting Table 1 relative to Table 2 suggests that emerging economies devote a
higher portion of total health expenditures to pharmaceuticals than developed countries.
BRICS health care spending is concentrated in pharmaceuticals with over 40% of total
health expenditures spent on drugs in India and China relative to 12% in the US. As a result,
the BRICS countries account for less than 8% of total world health expenditures but more
than 15% of total world pharmaceutical expenditures. Thus, due to the relative size their
pharmaceutical markets, the BRICS countries may play a larger role in spurring the
innovation of pharmaceuticals versus non‐pharmaceutical medical products and the
physician and hospital services tied to those products. However, the non‐pharmaceutical
related health care market in the BRICS countries is growing faster relative to the size of
their pharmaceutical markets.
3.1.2 Supply Trends
Our analysis implied that ownership shares across countries drives actual, although
not efficient, reimbursement policy. As country‐specific ownership shares of
pharmaceutical‐ and other health care companies are not available given existing data
sources, we use pharmaceutical production data18. In particular, we use pharmaceutical
production data to proxy for a country’s attention to supply side issues of supporting
innovative returns. Figure 4 displays the value19 of pharmaceutical production in the US,
Japan, China, India and Russia over the past thirty years as reported in the 2006 and 2010
online editions of the UN Industrial Statistics Database20

Data on firm ownership across countries is to our knowledge unavailable. Ideally we would like to know
the percentage of company XYZ that owned by US citizens, Chinese citizens, etc. for each firm and country.
18

Production is valued either in terms of factor cost, which excludes all indirect production taxes but includes
production subsidies, or in terms of producer prices, which includes indirect production taxes but excludes
production subsides.
19

The Database does not contain production data for the countries in BRICS not represented in graph.

FIGURE 4: PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTION

Notes on Figure 4:
 The data is from the 2006, 2010 and online editions of the UN Industrial Statistics Database. Data from
the online and 2010 edition reflects ISIC code 2423 “Pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemicals, etc.”
 Data from the 2006 edition reflects ISIC 352 “Other chemicals” and is scaled by 1/2 to reflect that ISIC
352 includes non‐pharmaceutical chemical production. The scaling factor was determined by the
average ratio of ISIC 2423 to ISIC 352 for the years/countries in which data overlapped between the
2006 and 2010 data sets.
 For the online data, output was converted into USD using annual forex data from
http://www.oanda.com/.
 Missing data points were linearly interpolated.

Over the period 1990 to 2008, pharmaceutical production in China and India
increased by a multiples of 15 and 6 respectively. During the same period pharmaceutical
production in the US increased by a multiple of 3 while production in Japan and Russia
remained relatively flat. Our analysis predicts a continued growth in the Chinese and
Indian production should put upward reimbursement pressure in those countries, while
putting downward pressure on reimbursements in other countries.

21

3.2 Empirical Analysis of Strategic Substitutability
3.2.1 Specification
We consider an empirical specification that allows us to test for the strategic
substitutability of reimbursements as well as the importance of supply and demand
changes on reimbursement policy. Due to the availability of data, our model focuses on the
reimbursements for pharmaceutical products rather than the more general problem of
profit provision for other medical products and services. The specialized version of the
previous analysis considered concerns when each country faces the optimal price setting
decision:

(4)

where the profits contributed by a given country

is an increasing function of its

own price.
This price setting problem and the profit provision problem discussed earlier are
direct analogs. The first order condition corresponding to the country’s optimal pricing
problem is the direct analog of the first order corresponding to the optimal profit provision
policy. Just as with profit provision, a country’s optimal price will be a function of its
demand factors, profit share and aggregate profits. The preceding comparative static result
that profits are strategic substitutes across countries applies to prices such that a country’s
optimal price level is decreasing in total world returns. Similarly, a country’s optimal price
level is increasing in its profit share. However, even though a country’s optimal profit level
is increasing in demand factors

, its corresponding optimal price may not be increasing

in demand factors. The key intuition behind the result is that since profit is function of
both price and quantity , an increase in a country’s size or income could lead to a higher
domestic profit level even if the country chooses to lowers its own price level. This occurs

22

when the quantity increase from the larger “size” of the country more than offsets any
possible reduction in markups21.
This price setting case lends itself to estimation of the following linearized
specification of strategic interaction
(5)

where

production in country k at time t (proxying for ownership shares),

is a vector of the demand factors that drive domestic pricing but not

foreign pricing of country k at time t. The term

revenues in country j at time t. If the marginal production costs are negligible, the empirical
model (eq. 5) is analogous to the model
(6)

Equations (5) and (6) are thus the linearized best response function corresponding to the
country’s optimal profit provision discussed earlier. We estimate a country’s best response
as per equation (5) rather than equation (6) due to the data availability issues regarding
accurate revenue and profit data.
Our analysis implies that prices are strategic substitutes, which corresponds to the
parameter restriction

. The analysis also predicts that countries earning a greater

In particular, the key sufficient condition we used to show that profits are increasing domestic in demand
factors in section 2.1 is
. The necessary condition to show that prices are increasing in domestic
demand factors is much stronger and less tenable and intuitive condition that
21

The condition implies that an increase in demand factors increases the marginal benefit of increasing price by
a larger amount than it increases the marginal cost of increasing price.

23

producer surplus from the pharmaceutical industry will set higher prices. Although we do
not observe the global distribution of pharmaceutical profits, we use pharmaceutical
production as a proxy for pharmaceutical profits. Also, countries may value domestic
pharmaceutical production for other reasons, such as labor demand. In that vein, the
analysis predicts that countries with greater pharmaceutical production will set higher
prices;

. Further, we expect the two demand factors population and GDP per capita to

be relevant price setting factors. Although our theory suggests that profits will be
increasing in the two demand factors population and GDP per capita, prices could be
decreasing in either population and/or GDP per capita as quantity may rise more than
markups fall.
Two primary econometric issues arise when estimating equation (5): the
simultaneity of prices and the endogeneity of production. The optimal price set by country
k is a function of the weighted sum of all other countries prices

, included the weighted sum,

strategy to circumvent the endogeneity problem and recover country k’s best response
function. Following our theoretical discussion in Section 2 on the effects of domestic
demand shifts22 we use, as instruments, the covariates of other countries,
by the same weights as specified in equation (5) lagged by one year

We use the

quantity weights from the previous as opposed to the current period to avoid further
endogeneity problems. The instrumental variables strategy relies on using exogenous
variation in the covariates of other countries,

, to trace out country k’s best response

function. The two country discussion of domestic demand shifts presented in Figure 2 of
22

Millimet 2002.
23

See Brueckner (2003) for an overview of empirical studies on strategic interaction among governments.

24

Section 2.1 illustrates the main concept behind our IV strategy. Holding all else equal, we
use the exogenous variation in Country 1’s demand covariates,

, to trace out the best

response function of Country 2 (and vice versa).
The validity of our IV estimate hinges on our instrument satisfying so called
relevancy and exogeneity conditions. The relevancy condition of instrumental variables
requires that the instrument, the weighted demand characteristics of other countries (
), is correlated with the endogenous variable,

, conditional on

,

and

. We test for relevancy in a standard manner by computing and analyzing the F‐statistics
from the first stage regressions and Shea’s partial

measure (1997). Each measure

provides evidence suggesting that the relevancy condition holds.
The exogeneity condition requires that our instrument is uncorrelated with
unobserved error term. Specifically, this requires that the unobserved determinants of
pharmaceutical prices (such as say preferences or costs) are uncorrelated with weighted
demand characteristics of other countries. Since the number of instruments exceeds the
number of endogenous variables, we empirically test the exogeneity condition as per
Sargan (1958) and fail to reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity in our fully specified
model.
Relating to the exogeneity condition, the IV method should also abate concerns
about potentially omitted variables in equation (5). It is reasonable to assume that
equation (5) does not contain the entire relevant price setting factors. For example one
might think that equation (5) omits potentially important demand and supply control
variables such as, most obviously, production costs. If pharmaceutical costs and/or
preferences are positively correlated across countries, one might expect the weighted sum
of other countries prices,
correlated with the error term,

, conditional on

,

and

to be positively

, which would result in our OLS estimates of

asymptotically biased upward such that

. Hence, the potential omitted

variables and endogeneity problem could result in OLS estimates of

suggesting that

prices are strategic complements across countries when they are in fact strategically
25

substitutes. Provided that the omitted variables are uncorrelated with our set of
instruments, the observed demand characteristics of other countries, our IV estimates will
correct for this asymptotic bias.
The final empirical issue involves the endogeneity of pharmaceutical production.
Unobserved domestic demand factors could potentially be positively correlated with
quantity of pharmaceuticals produced which would results in biased estimates of . We
correct for the endogeneity problem again using instrumental variables using lagged
production as an instrument for current production similar to the strategy employed by
Villas‐Boas and Winer (1999). The instrument is valid provided that domestic production is
correlated over time but previous pharmaceutical production is uncorrelated with current
demand shocks. As discussed previously, we again empirically assess the validity of the
instrument and find evidence suggesting that the exogeneity and relevancy conditions hold.
3.2.2 Data
We estimate equation (5) using pharmaceutical data from a balanced panel of 21
OECD countries over the period 1999 to 200824. The 21 countries accounted for roughly
over 80% of pharmaceutical spending in 1999. The pharmaceutical price index is
constructed from several sources. We use CPI data from the BLS, Eurostat, Japan and
Statistics Canada to measure within country pharmaceutical price movements across time
by using the ratio of pharmaceutical price index relative to consumer price index (all
goods) as suggested by Golec and Vernon (2006). Next, we are then able to scale the
relative pharmaceutical price levels across countries in the year 2005 using OECD relative
pharmaceutical price data25. Figure 5 below indicates the price movements of the US, Japan,
France, Germany and the UK over the period 1996 to 2010. The remaining data used in
estimation are summarized in Table 3.

24

Although the full data set spans 26 countries over 1996‐2010, we trim the data set to allow for a balanced panel.
As a robustness check we use the full unbalanced data set.
25

The relative pharmaceutical price data is from OECD Health Policy Studies (2008).

26

Due to data constraints, our pharmaceutical price index may be a noisy measure of
pharmaceutical prices. We use country specific pharmaceutical and consumer price indices
to capture the within country pharmaceutical price movements across time by looking at
changes in the ratio of pharmaceutical prices relative to all consumer prices. The
methodology used by the BLS, Eurostat, Japan and Statistics Canada to calculate
pharmaceutical and consumer price levels varies across the four sources which could
create inconsistencies in our price indices. The pharmaceutical price levels are first scaled
across countries using OECD relative pharmaceutical price data and then re‐scaled using
the Danzon and Furukawa (2003) data set as a robustness check26. The OECD
pharmaceutical price data is in terms of real purchasing power parity which may not be the
applicable measure for our context. However, as long as the measurement error in our
pharmaceutical price variable is orthogonal to our instrument, the demand characteristics
of other countries, our estimates will not suffer from any measurement error related bias.

The OECD relative pharmaceutical price index reflects final retail prices, or in other words the total social
cost of pharmaceuticals, which includes wholesaler and pharmacy markups and VAT rates. Danzon and
Furukawa’s index (Discounted All Molecule‐Indication) reflects manufacture price levels and which excludes
both wholesaler and pharmacy markups.

The health care expenditure, GDP and population data comes from the World Bank
Databank while the pharmaceutical expenditure data is compiled from the OECD iLibrary.
Pharmaceutical expenditures are computed as the product of: pharmaceutical expenditures
as a percentage of total health expenditures; total health expenditures as a percentage of
GDP; and real GDP (measured in constant USD)27.
The production data comes from comes from the UN Industrial Statistics Database
(INDSTAT4 2010 ISIC Rev. 3). Production data is available for only 19 out of the 21
countries discussed previously over the period 1999‐200628. One potential issue is that
how production is valued across countries potentially differs in terms of whether it is
valued at producer’s prices or factor prices. This measurement error could result in
potential bias. Further, it is likely that the measurement error is correlated across time;
consequently our instrumental variables strategy does little to mitigate this issue. Provided
that the measurement error is classical, our estimate of

may suffer from an attenuation

bias.
3.2.3 Estimation Results
Table 4 indicates our estimation results corresponding to equation (5). Columns (1)‐
(3) report the results of the regression of pharmaceutical prices on the weighted sum of
other prices,

,, GDP per capita, and population. Pharmaceutical output is

included as an additional regressor in the specifications reported in columns (4)‐(6). We
report specifications with and without pharmaceutical output as including pharmaceutical
output limits the size and time span of our dataset. In columns (4) and (6), we instrument
for the weighted sum of prices,

, using the weighted sum of other country

Data on pharmaceutical expenditures as a percentage of total health expenditures is linearly interpolated
for Portugal and the United Kingdom in the year 1999, the Netherlands in years 2003‐2006, and Belgium in
years 1999‐2002.
27

Production data is unavailable for Japan and the United Kingdom in the year 2006, Slovakia and Belgium in
the year 2002, Ireland in the year 2004, and Canada in years 2004‐2006. These data points are treated as

population and GDP per capita covariates. We also instrument for pharmaceutical output
using lagged pharmaceutical output in column (6).
The results of all six specifications indicate that pharmaceutical prices across
countries are strategic substitutes. The coefficient, , for the weighted sum of other
countries prices, is negative and statistically significant at the either 5% or 1% level in each
regression. The results from column (1) can be interpreted as follows: for a particular
country, an exogenous $100 billion dollar increase in global pharmaceutical expenditures,
, is correlated with a 0.081 unit decrease in the country’s absolute price index.
Since the scale of the price index is somewhat arbitrary, it is useful to note that a 0.081 unit
decrease in the price index corresponds to a roughly 7.9%29 decrease. Given the
aforementioned endogeneity concerns, if
would expect our OLS estimates of

and

30

we

to be biased upwards. When comparing the IV

regression (3) to the OLS regression (2) and the IV regression (6) to the OLS regression (5),
is indeed higher in the OLS specifications.
The model developed in Section 2 suggests that pharmaceutical prices and domestic
pharmaceutical production should be positively related. When controlling for country fixed
effects, our estimate of production effects, , is positive and significant at the 1% level in
both specifications. The estimate of in column (6) can be roughly interpreted as a $10
billion exogenous increase in a country’s pharmaceutical production is correlated with a
0.08 unit increase in a country’s price index level which corresponds to a 7.8% decrease in
prices. The inclusion of domestic pharmaceutical production is motivated from our
theoretical results regarding domestic profit shares and is used as a proxy variable. If
domestic production is a poor proxy for domestic profit shares (and potentially countries
may not otherwise value domestic production), our estimates could suffer from a
measurement error bias. Provided that the measurement error is classical, our estimates of

could suffer from attenuation bias. Consequently, we may be underestimating the
domestic supply effect on pharmaceutical prices.
Our theoretical model suggests that the demand, population and GDP per capita are
relevant factors in a country’s price setting decision. However, our theory only indicates
that profits, not necessarily prices will be positively correlated with GDP per capita and
population. The empirical estimates suggest both that GDP per capita and population are
relevant price setting factors and that the optimal profit level is increasing in GDP per
capita and population size. The GDP per capita coefficient estimate is positive and
significant in four of the six specifications. Further, the magnitudes of the GDP per capita
coefficient estimates seem intuitively plausible. The results from column (1) suggest that a
1,000 increase in GDP per capita is correlated with a roughly 0.01 unit (1.0% change) in
pharmaceutical prices.
The relationship between population size and pharmaceutical prices is less clear
than the relationship between GDP per capita and prices. The population coefficient is
positive in two of the specifications while negative and statistically significant in two of the
other specifications. The results from column (5) can be interpreted as a 10 million
increase in country’s population size is associated with a 0.24 unit (23.5%) decrease in the
price level. Even though the price coefficient is negative, that does not imply that an
increase in population size leads to a decrease in profits. For example, suppose a country’s
population exogenously increases from $29 million to $30 million people. Our estimates
imply the price level will decrease by 2.35% as a result of the shift in population.
Concurrently, the quantity of pharmaceuticals consumed will increase due to the shift in
population. Provided that the quantity of pharmaceuticals consumed per capita does not
change as a result of the shift in population, profits will increase overall by 1%.

Notes on Table 4
 One, two and three stars indicate significance at 10, 5 and 1 percent levels.
 The Real Pharmaceutical Price index is scaled across countries using OECD relative prices as
discussed in Section 3.2.2.



In specification (3) and (6) we instrument for

using the weighted (weights lagged by

one year) sum of other country covariates (population and GDP per capita). Specification (6) also
uses lagged pharmaceutical output as an instrument for pharmaceutical output.



Population is measured in 100 million people, GDP Per Capita is measured in 10 thousands (2005
USD), and pharmaceutical output is measured in 10 billions (2005 USD)



The weights

correspond to the quantity of pharmaceuticals consumed in country j at time t in

terms of trillions dollars (2005 USD). We also construct weights using population and income shares
and find quantitatively similar results.



Specifications (3) and (6) were estimated using two stage least squares. The corresponding F‐
statistics for each first stage regression exceed 100. Following Sargan test of over identifying
restrictions (1958), we fail to reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity at the 1% level in specification
(3), and fail to reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity at the 10% level in specification (6).



As a robustness check we re‐estimate the model using alternative pharmaceutical pricing data from
Danzon and Furukawa’s (2003). Further, we estimate alternative specifications (such as including a
time trend) and also re‐estimate the model using an unbalanced panel covering 26 OECD countries
over the period 1996‐2010. Ultimately, we find quantitatively similar results in each robustness
check.

32

As discussed, the IV estimates displayed in columns (3) and (6) rely on our
instruments satisfying the relevance and exogeneity criteria. The F‐statistics corresponding
to the first stage regressions exceed 100 in each of the three first stage regressions. As
there are two endogenous variables in specification (6), examining the F‐statistic from the
first stage regressions is potentially misleading in terms of assessing the instrument
relevancy condition. As a further check, we find that the Shea partial

exceeds 0.55 for

each endogenous variable in specification (6). Since the number of instruments exceeds the
number of endogenous variables in both specification (3) and (6) we test the
overidentifying restriction. Following the Sargan (1958) test, we fail to reject the null
hypothesis of exogeneity at the 10% level in the full specification in column (6)31.
Combined with the preceding theoretical justification, we find extensive evidence
suggesting that both the exogeneity and relevancy conditions hold.
We run several robustness checks to assess the validity of our estimates in Table 4.
Given the aforementioned concerns regarding the pharmaceutical price data, we re‐
estimate the model after first re‐scaling our relative pharmaceutical price index across
countries using Danzon and Furukawa’s (2003) cross‐country relative price index. We find
quantitatively similar results in terms of levels and significance, especially with regards to
the parameters of interest

and . The re‐scaled estimates of our preferred specification

(Column 6 of Table 4) are statistically indistinguishable from our original estimates. We
also find quantitatively similar results when try alternative specifications (such as
including time trends, taking logs, etc.) and when using an expanded unbalanced panel data
set covering 26 countries over the period 1996‐2010.
The empirical findings are in‐line with those from the theoretical model. We find
that prices are strategic substitutes amongst countries and some limited evidence
suggesting that prices are higher in countries with higher demand for pharmaceuticals. It
should be noted that it would be a mistake to interpret the estimated coefficients too

31

We also fail to reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity at the 1% level in specification (3).

literally. The first order condition (3) indicates that the relationship between country k and
country j ‘s prices quite possibly non‐linear and heterogeneous; however, we estimate a
linear reaction function as simple test for strategic substitutability. Although the exact
reaction function remains to be determined, understanding the direction in which country
k responds to price reform in country j has important policy implications.
3.3 BRICS and the Future of World Returns
This section discusses how to use the estimated effects of strategic substitutability
in reimbursement, whether in pharmaceuticals as here or in other markets, to estimate the
impact of growing world demand on world returns. Using our estimates, we project how
the health care and pharmaceutical expenditure growth in BRICS will impact world
returns to medical innovation.
Consider the two region case with Country 1 (BRICS) and Country 2 (US). Total Nash
equilibrium world returns are

Our earlier analysis indicated that future BRICS income growth should lead to an increase
in demand for health care and an increase in BRICS returns as well as total world returns.

From our previous analysis we showed that prices are strategic substitutes. Thus, total
returns will increase due to the direct demand growth from the BRICS countries but will
increase by less than that direct response due to the decrease in profit provision from the
US
Suppose the increase in demand from the BRICS countries is associated with a shift
in production and profit shares from the US to BRICS such

. The change in profit

shares of BRICS results in an increase in profit provision of BRICS but a decrease in US
profit provision.
34

The net impact of a shift in profit shares on aggregate profits is thus ambiguous. Putting
these two results together the anticipated shift in BRICS demand and profit shares leads to
a net increase or decrease in world innovation.
Some simple back of the envelope calculations are useful in illustrating the
magnitudes of the tradeoffs involved. In year 2010, total world health care spending was
$4.3 trillion, of which 7% percent was from BRICS countries. Now consider a projected
two‐fold increase in revenues for BRICS countries by 201632. Both our theoretical and
empirical analysis indicates that non‐BRICS countries will respond to the growth in BRICS
by lowering their domestic reimbursements. If non‐BRICS countries were to respond to the
100% increase in BRICS revenues by lowering reimbursements by a mere 7.5%, world
revenues would decline overall. The fact that US and other countries currently dominate
world returns means that markups reductions need to be fairly small to offset a substantial
demand growth in the BRICS.
Our empirical analysis estimated a county’s strategic price response to a change in
total pharmaceutical revenues as well as its own demand factors. Consider the projected
two‐fold increase in pharmaceutical revenues stemming from BRICS countries by the year
2016. The projected increase amounts to a roughly $100 billion increase in pharmaceutical
expenditures from BRICS countries. Our model suggests that a portion and potentially all of
the increase in pharmaceutical expenditures could be offset by the strategic pricing
responses of richer countries currently dominating the contribution to world returns.
Each country’s strategic response to an outside increase world revenues,
, is given by

in the empirical specification estimated (eq. 5). An exogenous

increase in pharmaceutical revenues is equivalent to the term,

, increasing by

This is the suggested growth rate in industry publications, see e.g. IMS Institute’s “The Global Use of
Medicines Outlook Through 2016”
32

35

$100 billon in our empirical model. The model estimates indicate that a $100 billion
increase in pharmaceutical revenues is correlated with a roughly 0.089 unit decrease in a
country’s price index level, holding all else equal. By aggregating the price response across
all countries and holding quantities constant, we are able to estimate the how much of the
exogenous increase in pharmaceutical revenues from BRICS countries will potentially be
offset by strategic price responses. Letting

denote the set of BRICS countries, the

aggregate impact, in terms of pharmaceutical revenues, of the non‐BRICS countries
strategic response to the exogenous increase in BRICS revenues is given by:

where

represents the exogenous change in global revenues from the BRICS

countries which in this case is $100 billon. Since quantities are assumed to remain
constant, the change in profits corresponds one for one with a change in revenues. Using
the estimate

, the above calculation implies that the aggregate strategic response

will be roughly ‐$37 billon. In other words, a $100 billion exogenous increase in
pharmaceutical revenues will be partially offset by a $37 billon decrease in pharmaceutical
revenues as countries strategically respond by lowering their pharmaceutical prices.
The $37 billion strategic response should be thought of as an upper bound (in terms
of the magnitude of the response) for several reasons. First, by fixing quantities we are
overstating the impact decreasing pharmaceutical prices will have on pharmaceutical
revenues. As prices fall, the decline in revenues will be less in percentage terms than a one
for one. The quantity of pharmaceuticals demanded will increase as prices fall which offset
some of the corresponding decline in revenues. Secondly, the above analysis ignores
secondary price responses. For example, if the US knows that the strategic response of
other countries will partially offset the exogenous increase world pharmaceutical revenues,
the US will lower its prices by a smaller amount than it would have otherwise. Regardless
of the exact magnitude, our model indicates that a sizeable amount of the pharmaceutical
36

expenditure growth stemming from the BRICS countries will be offset by the strategic
responses of other countries.
As discussed previously, the increase in BRICS may also be associated with a shift
concentration in the ownership of profits which in addition to demand growth affects
reimbursement policies. Consider when 10% of US profits (as represented by production in
our empirical analysis) shifts to the BRICS countries over the next few years. The
theoretical and empirical results predict that this shift will result in a decrease in US prices
and an increase in BRICS prices. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the estimated impact BRICS
growth will have on future pharmaceutical and total health care revenues when production
shifts from the US to the BRICS countries. Using data from the pharmaceutical sector, in
section 3.2 we estimate that for every $1 increase in BRICS pharmaceutical spending leads
to only an increase of $0.63 in in total pharmaceutical revenues. In Figures 6 and 7 we
analyze the implications of this offset assuming it extended to overall health care
reimbursements as well as for pharmaceuticals alone. The separate impact of the
production shift on world returns is calculated with the estimate

from the

preceding analysis of pharmaceutical pricing. As BRICS countries represent 15% of the
pharmaceutical market and only 7% of the total health care market, an increase the BRICS
growth (in percentage terms) has a much larger impact on the pharmaceutical market than
the total health care market. Given the 10% shift in production, BRICS health care
(pharmaceutical) revenue growth would have to increase by over 270% (126%) for world
revenues to increase overall. The main point these quantitative effects imply is that when
both demand and supply growth occurs through the BRICS, reasonable parameter levels
suggests that a fall (as opposed to a rise) in world returns may result.

These quantitative effects suggest that demand growth in BRICS countries has the
potential to expand pharmaceutical returns and consequently stimulate further medical
innovations. However, the strategic responses of existing developed countries could largely
offset and even decrease world returns to innovation and the larger spending growth it
may entail. This is especially true if the expected increase in demand is accompanied by a
shift in ownership to the BRICS.
4. Conclusions and Further Research
Because world returns drive innovation and because innovation is central to health
care spending growth, health care economies and policies of other countries thereby
drastically affect domestic spending growth. This paper analyzed the unique positive and
normative implications of these innovation‐induced linkages across countries when
governments centrally price health care. We stressed the implications of the inherent
public‐goods problem in providing world returns when taxation to fund reimbursements
involves a domestic cost with an international benefit. Because of this public‐goods
problem, medical innovations have inefficiently low world returns, and reimbursements
were predicted to be “strategic substitutes.” We argued that the public‐goods aspect of
medical innovation creates a significant concern in the concentration of world demand and
supply. We provided an empirical analysis of the effects of the future decline in this
concentration on world returns by considering the plausible conditions under which future
growth of the BRICS may lower world returns.
We conclude by discussing some of the implications of our analysis as well as future
areas of research.
4.1 Domestic and Regional Health Care Reforms
Our analysis implies that health care reforms that aim to curb spending growth will
have different effects, depending on a country’s importance for world returns. Put
differently, reforms in small countries will not affect spending growth rates induced by
39

innovation, although US reforms will. For the same reason, using US states as “laboratories
for reform” does not capture innovation or growth effects because individual states do not
affect world returns. For example, even though reforms in Massachusetts were similar to
the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) reforms, the lessons learned about the impact on
growth of spending are minimal if that state does not affect world returns. Likewise, the
many regional payment demonstration experiments that ACA is financing do not address
spending growth induced by world returns to innovation. Rather, differences in technology
adoption procedures appear to be a key factor affecting regional spending growth in the
face of world returns driving common innovations across countries. Indeed, our analysis
implies that subnational or regional reimbursement levels will be lower than national ones.
For example, state Medicaid programs are predicted, as observed, to price below the
federal Medicare program in the United States, even though Medicare clearly is a bigger
buyer with larger bargaining power. Future research should investigate the impact of
regional versus national public reimbursement policies.
4.2 International Spending Levels and Growth Rates
Our analysis can be developed further to examine international spending patterns
across countries, particularly as those spending patterns are often attributable to
differences in pricing rather than use. If innovation is a public good that drives spending
growth and is used by everyone, it suggests less variance in growth rates across countries
than that in levels due to the differential markup incentives discussed. More generally, a
better understanding of the incentives that determine the growth in reimbursements over
time implied by our analysis, rather than the levels analyzed here, seems a useful avenue of
research.
4.3 An Evaluation of Domestic Underpricing through Existing Pricing Regimes
Since efficient world pricing can be viewed as a classic public‐goods problem,
standard remedies to avoid free riding in providing public goods seem relevant. As is
common under positive external effects, the behavior of interest is underprovided, and
efficiency gains can be achieved with Pigouvian subsidies that aim to equate the domestic
40

costs of markup provision providing the world’s benefit in terms of generating new
innovations. Evaluating the efficiency effects of international reimbursement reforms in
this context seems to be worthwhile. In particular, more centralized European Union (EU)
pricing may raise innovative returns rather than the separate domestic pricing by
individual countries. This would be the reimbursement analog to the more advanced
European Medicines Agency (EMA) harmonization for approval processes in the EU. If
countries unified their reimbursement decisions, it might raise prices to more efficient
levels. The obvious counterargument is that a larger buyer forces down prices more, but as
we have shown, that is not always the case. Smaller countries are free riding more, in an
individually optimal manner, by keeping reimbursements low.
4.4 Personalized Medicine
Many analysts have argued that personalized medicines and orphan drugs are likely
to reduce market size for therapies. Clearly, the growth of world markets, in particular, the
BRICS, may well substantially increase the use of domestic orphan drugs in a world market,
thus aggregating the orphan status within each country across new, large economies such
as the BRICS. However, the free‐riding incentives discussed here mitigate the positive
impact on world returns. A valuable course of research may lie in investigating the degree
to which emerging markets affect the incentives for innovation of rare diseases or
personalized medicines, often argued to be plagued by low innovation incentives due to
small market size.
Overall, more quantitative analysis is needed concerning the impact of innovation‐
induced linkages across health care economies, both for positive analysis to explain
differences in reimbursements and spending and for normative analysis of what policies
function in a given country’s self‐interest.

share of Country 1 increases by

demand arguments of consumer surplus are omitted for convenience):

The change in total equilibrium profits, resulting from a change in profits is equal to

The sign thus depends on the levels and curvatures of the social cost and probability of
innovation functions. In the simple parametric example discussed in Section 2, it is
straightforward to generate cases in which a change in profit shares increases total profits,
decreases total profits, and does not change total profits.
