Labor Market Slack and Monetary Policy

NBER Working Paper No. 21094

JEL No. E24,E32,E52,E58,J21
ABSTRACT
In the wake of a severe recession and a sluggish recovery, labor market slack cannot be gauged solely
in terms of the conventional measure of the unemployment rate (that is, the number of individuals
who are not working at all and actively searching for a job). Rather, assessments of the employment
gap should reflect the incidence of underemployment (that is, people working part time who want
a full-time job) and the extent of hidden unemployment (that is, people who are not actively searching
but who would rejoin the workforce if the job market were stronger). In this paper, we examine the
evolution of U.S. labor market slack and show that underemployment and hidden unemployment currently
account for the bulk of the U.S. employment gap. Next, using state-level data, we find strong statistical
evidence that each of these forms of labor market slack exerts significant downward pressure on nominal
wages. Finally, we consider the monetary policy implications of the employment gap in light of prescriptions
from Taylor-style benchmark rules.

1. Introduction
A fundamental cornerstone of modern macroeconomics is that the economy has a balancedgrowth path that is characterized by stable inflation as well as steady growth of production
and employment. In effect, if the economy becomes “overheated” and persistently exceeds
its balanced-growth path, then the most notable symptom will be an acceleration of nominal
wages and prices and hence inflation overshooting the central bank’s target. Conversely, a
persistent shortfall in economic activity and employment not only has substantial adverse
effects on households’ well-being but is also associated with downward pressure on wages
and prices and hence with inflation falling persistently short of the central bank’s target.
Thus, ongoing assessments of the contours of the balanced-growth path—and of significant
deviations from that path—are a crucial element of the design and communication of
monetary policy, especially for a central bank with a legal mandate to foster maximum
employment and price stability.1
In gauging movements in labor market slack over previous business cycles, macroeconomists
have generally focused on the gap between the conventional unemployment rate (that is, the
incidence of people who are out of work and actively searching for a job) and the “natural
rate of unemployment” judged to be consistent with the balanced-growth path. In the wake
of a severe recession and a sluggish recovery, however, the conventional unemployment gap
can be a relatively poor or even misleading indicator of labor market slack. In particular,
assessments of the shortfall of employment from the balanced-growth path should also
incorporate the extent of hidden unemployment (that is, people who are not actively searching
but who would rejoin the labor force if the job market were stronger) and the incidence of
underemployment (that is, people working part time who want a full-time job).
In this paper, we begin by examining the evolution of U.S. labor market slack over recent
years and show that underemployment and hidden unemployment currently account for the
bulk of the employment gap. Our benchmark assessment of the current magnitude of the
shortfall in U.S. employment—including the incidence of underemployment and hidden
unemployment—is equivalent to about 3.3 million full-time jobs. Moreover, the uncertainty
surrounding that assessment is clearly skewed to the upside, so the actual shortfall in
employment might well be twice that large.
Recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis indicates that the potential labor force is
currently expanding by about 50,000 to 60,000 individuals per month due to demographic

The Federal Open Market Committee’s Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy (adopted in
January 2012 and reaffirmed annually since then) describes its mandated objectives of maximum employment
and price stability as “generally complementary.”

factors. Thus, if nonfarm payrolls continue to rise steadily by around 260,000 jobs per month
(which has been the average pace over the past few quarters), then the employment gap
might be eliminated toward the end of next year. In contrast, if the economic recovery
decelerates and payroll growth slows to around 100,000 jobs per month (roughly similar to
its pace during 2010 and most of 2011), then the employment gap would barely diminish at
all over coming years.
Next, using state-level data, we find strong statistical evidence that underemployment and
hidden unemployment each place significant downward pressure on wages.2 Such results
should not be surprising, because employers often fill a job vacancy by hiring a person who
had previously been working part time (either at the same firm or elsewhere) or by hiring a
person who has just rejoined the labor force (and hence wasn’t being counted as
unemployed), rather than having to bid up the wage of an incumbent full-time worker.
Recent data on U.S. nominal wage growth is fully consistent with our assessment that labor
market slack remains substantial. As shown in the left panel of Figure 1, the average hourly
earnings of all private nonfarm employees decelerated markedly in the wake of the Great
Recession, and since 2010 nominal wage growth has remained mired at around 2 percent.3
Indeed, the latest 12-month change (from March 2014 through March 2015) was 2.1 percent.
The right panel of the figure shows the evolution of nominal wages for production and
nonsupervisory workers, a measure that is less sensitive to movements in the upper range of
the wage distribution and hence more informative about broader wage trends. Recent
readings on this measure suggest some slowing in nominal wage growth over the past few
quarters: The 12-month change through March 2015 was 1.75 percent, down about a half
percentage point from its pace last summer.4
Finally, we consider the monetary policy implications of labor market slack using a variant
of the simple rule that was analyzed extensively by Taylor (1999) and characterized as the
“balanced approach rule” by Yellen (2012).
2

In a speech on January 15, 2015, Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta,
stated that economists at his institution have also “advanced the thesis that the elevated number of people
working part time involuntarily is restraining wage growth.”

3

The same pattern is evident for other measures of labor compensation such as the employment cost index.
Indeed, Robertson and Terry (2015) analyzed a range of indicators of nominal wage growth and concluded that
“none of the characteristic-specific median growth rates we looked at are close to returning to prerecession
levels. Lower-than-normal wage growth appears to be a very widespread feature of the labor market since the
end of the recession.”

4

Lack of wage growth is also found in other BLS wage series. Median usual weekly earnings for full-time
wage and salary workers grew by 1.9 percent in 2014 and by 1.7 percent in 2014:Q4. For all civilian workers,
the employment cost index grew by 2.2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of 2014.

2. Gauging Labor Market Slack
2.1 The Employment Gap
Our measure of the employment gap is the sum of three specific components.5 First, the
unemployment gap is the deviation of the conventional unemployment rate (labeled “U3” by
BLS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics) from professional forecasters’ consensus projections of
its longer-run normal rate (as reported in semiannual Blue Chip surveys). Second, the
participation gap is the deviation (in percentage points) of the actual size of the labor force
from CBO assessments of the potential labor force; this shortfall corresponds to the notion of
“hidden unemployment” described above. Third, the underemployment gap takes the BLS
measure of people working part time for economic reasons (expressed as a fraction of the
potential labor force) as a deviation from its 1994-2007 average and then converts this
deviation into full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs.6
As shown in Figure 2, the U.S. employment gap has narrowed markedly over the past few
years, along with each of its three components. Nonetheless, it is readily apparent that the
conventional unemployment rate has not served as an accurate synopsis of the evolution of
labor market slack. For example, the declining unemployment rate over the course of 2010
and most of 2011 was not induced by a pickup in job growth but instead reflected the extent
to which many Americans gave up searching for work and departed from the labor force. In
effect, the reduction in the unemployment gap was almost fully offset by an increase in the
participation gap, and hence the overall employment gap showed very little improvement
during that period.
Even more importantly, it is evident that the U.S. economic recovery remains far from
complete in spite of apparently reassuring recent signals from the conventional
unemployment rate. Indeed, while the unemployment gap has become quite small, the
incidence of underemployment remains elevated and the size of the labor force remains well
below CBO’s assessment of its potential. In particular, the employment gap currently stands
at 1.9 percent, suggesting that the “true” unemployment rate (including underemployment
and hidden unemployment) should be viewed as around 7½ percent. Gauged in human terms,
the current magnitude of the employment shortfall is equivalent to about 3.3 million full-time
jobs.

5
6

This measure of the employment gap was introduced by Levin (2014).

The FTE conversion factor is computed using BLS data on the average weekly hours of individuals working
part time for economic reasons compared to the average weekly hours of individuals who are working full time.

4
Of course, the characteristics of the economy’s balanced-growth path cannot be directly
observed, and hence any particular assessment of the deviations from that path is necessarily
subject to considerable uncertainty. In the context of a typical business cycle, such
uncertainty might reasonably be judged as symmetric around the benchmark estimate. At the
present juncture, however, it seems plausible that professional forecasters and analysts at
policy institutions may have become overly pessimistic in gauging the extent to which the
Great Recession caused permanent damage to the U.S. labor market. Consequently, the
confidence bands around our current assessment of the employment gap may in fact be
skewed to the upside, i.e., this assessment may well be an underestimate of the true
magnitude of labor market slack. To examine that possibility, we now consider each of the
individual components of the employment gap in turn.
2.2 The Unemployment Gap
CBO regularly produces assessments of the natural unemployment rate that would prevail if
the economy were on its balanced-growth path.7 More specifically, CBO defines the natural
rate as the level of unemployment “arising from all sources except fluctuations in aggregate
demand.” In the wake of the Great Recession, CBO refined its analysis to gauge the extent
to which the natural rate has been affected by transitory vs. persistent structural factors.
Thus, over the past few years CBO has produced estimates of the long-term natural rate, a
measurement that solely reflects the influences of longer-lasting structural factors.8

7

These assessments are published in its annual Budget and Economic Outlook each January or February as well
as in CBO’s mid-year updates each August.
8

Since 2011 CBO has also produced estimates of the short-term natural rate, which incorporates the effects of
transitory structural factors. In 2014, CBO relabeled the “long-term natural rate” as the “underlying long-term
rate of unemployment” and began referring to the “short-term natural rate” as simply “the natural rate.” In the
immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, the distinction between these two measures was quite substantial
(with a peak difference of around 0.8 percentage points). As of 2015, however, the two measures are now
identical; i.e., CBO has concluded that transitory structural factors are no longer having any significant
influence on the natural rate of unemployment.

5

Surveys of professional forecasters generally do not collect information about their estimates
of the natural rate of unemployment. However, forecasters routinely make longer-run
projections regarding the path to which the economy is expected to converge over time, and
such projections essentially reflect their assessments of characteristics of the balancedgrowth path, including the growth rate of potential output and the natural rate of
unemployment. In particular, Blue Chip longer-run surveys (which are conducted semiannually in March and October) report on the consensus and range of forecasters’ projections
of the average unemployment rate 5 to 10 years ahead.9
As shown in Figure 3, the Blue Chip consensus longer-run outlook for unemployment as of
early 2008 was 4.8 percent—virtually identical to CBO’s assessment of the natural
unemployment rate. In effect, analysts generally agreed that the unemployment gap at that
juncture was effectively nil. Shortly thereafter, the actual unemployment rate skyrocketed
upward, reaching 10 percent by late 2009. CBO then raised its assessment of the natural rate
by just a notch, whereas professional forecasters evidently became much more pessimistic
about the prospects for long-lasting damage to the labor market. The Blue Chip longer-run
consensus outlook moved up to around 6 percent, and the top quartile of projections in that
survey reached nearly 7 percent. By 2012, CBO had come to share much of that pessimism
and hence marked up its estimate of the long-term natural rate to levels similar to those of the
Blue Chip consensus.
Over the past few years, as the unemployment rate has declined steadily and wage inflation
has remained subdued, professional forecasters have been gradually marking down their
longer-run projections for the unemployment rate. In the Blue Chip longer-run survey
published in March 2015, the consensus outlook for unemployment was 5.1 percent, while
the bottom quartile has declined to 4.5 percent and the top quartile of projections now stands
at 5.5 percent. Interestingly, that consensus outlook is identical to the midpoint of the central
tendency of FOMC participants’ longer-run unemployment rate projections that were
released in conjunction with the March 2015 FOMC meeting. CBO’s latest assessment of
the long-term natural rate (published in late January) was a notch higher, at 5.4 percent.
It seems reasonable to infer that the uncertainty surrounding these assessments is skewed to
the downside. Indeed, if unemployment declines further over coming quarters while wage
inflation remains subdued, analysts will presumably make even further downward revisions
to their assessments of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Thus, while our
benchmark estimate of the unemployment gap is quite small, its true magnitude might well
be substantially larger—perhaps by as much as three-fourths of a percentage point.

2.3 The Participation Gap
In conjunction with its estimates of potential output and the natural unemployment rate, CBO
produces regular assessments of the historical and projected size of the potential labor force,
that is, the balanced-growth path for the labor force that would prevail in the absence of
aggregate demand shocks. In effect, given detailed projections for the size and demographic
composition of the population (mainly drawing on the work of the Census Bureau), CBO’s
assessments of the potential labor force convey its analysis of how demographic and
structural factors are likely to influence the evolution of labor force participation over time.
Figure 4 depicts the evolution of CBO’s assessments of the potential labor force. As of
January 2008, CBO estimated that the actual labor force (specifically, about 154 million
people) was very close to its potential level; i.e., the participation gap was judged to be
negligible. Moreover, at that juncture CBO projected that the potential labor force would
expand at an annual pace of about three-quarters of a percent through 2012 and would then
decelerate somewhat to an annual pace of about half a percent in subsequent years.10
In the wake of the Great Recession, the U.S. labor force actually decreased in size through
mid-2011 and then resumed a moderate upward trajectory over the past few years.
Nonetheless, from 2009 through 2013, CBO made only modest revisions to its assessments
of the potential labor force. Most notably, CBO analysis indicated that the labor force had
exceeded its potential size by about a full percentage point during the leadup to the financial
crisis. However, CBO made roughly offsetting adjustments to the projected growth rate of
the potential labor force, and hence the implications for the magnitude of the participation
gap as of 2013 were essentially the same as implied by its January 2008 assessment.
In contrast, CBO has recently made substantial downward revisions to its assessments of the
entire post-2008 trajectory for the potential labor force. In particular, CBO now judges that
demographic and structural factors account for a larger share of the post-2008 decline in
labor force participation than indicated by its previous analysis. Moreover, CBO has
concluded that much of the cyclical decline in labor force participation has become
irreversible; i.e., CBO now anticipates that only two-thirds of the individuals who departed
from the workforce in the wake of the Great Recession will rejoin the labor force as the
economy continues to strengthen.
Evidently, such judgments have crucial implications for gauging the current magnitude of the
shortfall in U.S. employment. According to CBO’s latest assessment of the potential labor
10

As discussed in Erceg and Levin (2014), CBO’s labor force projections in early 2008 were broadly consistent
with the projections that were published by BLS in November 2007.

7
force, the participation gap currently stands at around 0.8 percent (which is the value that we
used in constructing our benchmark estimate of the employment gap as shown in Figure 2).
By contrast, CBO’s outlook as of February 2013 implies a substantially larger participation
gap of around 2.6 percent and hence that the employment gap is nearly twice as large as our
benchmark estimate.
Breaking down the data by gender is also relevant for assessing the extent to which the post2007 decline in U.S. labor force participation might be largely structural or irreversible. As
shown in the first panel of Figure 5, the participation rate of males age 45 to 54 years was
drifting downward during the late 1990s, but that trend was arrested and perhaps even
reversed during the mid-2000s. Thus, there is evidently a substantial degree of uncertainty
about the current magnitude of the participation gap for this demographic group. If one fits a
linear trend over the decade ending in 2007, then the actual participation rate is now within a
percentage point of that trend line—roughly similar to CBO’s current assessment of the
aggregate participation gap. By contrast, if one fits a linear trend over the five-year period
ending in 2007, then the participation gap is around 3 percentage points, roughly consistent
with the implications of CBO’s assessments several years ago.
As shown in the second panel of Figure 5, the participation rate of females age 45 to 54 years
was essentially flat from 2000 through 2007, and hence there is simply no basis whatsoever
for attributing its post-2007 decline to structural factors. Rather, it seems evident that this
decline resulted from the persistent weakness of the job market in the wake of the Great
Recession. Moreover, the magnitude of that decline—about 2½ percentage points—is
virtually identical to the drop in labor force participation of all prime-age adults (that is, age
25 to 54 years), who comprise the bulk of the U.S. labor force. In effect, this pattern bolsters
the view that the Great Recession and its aftermath were largely responsible for the post2007 decline in the U.S. participation rate, consistent with the conclusions of a number of
recent empirical studies.11
Finally, it should be noted that the participation rate of males age 45 to 54 years has recently
moved up by nearly a full percentage point, from 85.3 percent last spring to 86.2 percent in
the latest BLS employment report. That development may reasonably provide some
reassurance that the labor market damage from the Great Recession is not irreversible and
that many other prime-age adults (both male and female) as well as younger adults will
decide to rejoin the labor force if the job market continues to strengthen going forward.

2.4 The Underemployment Gap
Gauging the underemployment gap seems relatively straightforward by comparison with the
challenges of assessing the unemployment gap and the participation gap. As shown in
Figure 6, the underemployment rate—that is, the incidence of people working part time for
economic reasons (PTER) as a fraction of total employment—did not exhibit any trend over
the period from 1994 through 2007. It seems implausible that the sudden rise in
underemployment during the Great Recession was caused by demographic or structural
factors. And individuals who are underemployed are clearly not “unemployable” (as some
have suggested about the long-term unemployed or those who have dropped out of the
workforce), since they are already working but simply can’t find a full-time job. Indeed,
BLS data indicate that the average person classified as PTER is working about 23 hours per
week.
Moreover, it seems unlikely that structural factors are the primary reason why the incidence
of underemployment has only declined gradually over the past few years. After all, if the
economy were on its balanced-growth path and some employers preferred to shift their
workforce toward a greater number of part-time positions, then those employers would need
to offer a relatively higher wage to induce workers to take part-time jobs voluntarily—a
phenomenon that is certainly not evident in the current job market.
In light of these considerations, it is striking that the underemployment rate has only moved
about halfway back from its 2009 peak towards its pre-recession level. That pattern might
well suggest that the overall magnitude of labor market slack may have diminished by a
similar proportion. In particular, as shown in figure 2, the employment gap reached a peak of
about 6 percent in early 2010. Consequently, it may be reasonable to infer that the
employment gap currently stands at around 3 percent—that is, about a percentage point
higher than our benchmark assessment. In effect, the evolution of the underemployment gap
reinforces the view that the uncertainty surrounding our benchmark assessment of the
employment gap is skewed to the upside.
3. The Wage Curve
We now move on to examine the extent to which measures of labor market slack over and
above the unemployment rate impact wages. We do so following the approach taken by
Blanchflower and Oswald (1994), using data from the merged outgoing rotation group
(MORG) files extracted from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is collected
monthly and is used to calculate the unemployment rate and other labor market aggregates

9
published monthly by BLS in the Employment Situation jobs release.12 Data are available
from 1990 to 2012, so with 50 states and the District of Columbia, there are 1,173
observations in total.13
Table 1 presents results using the log of hourly earnings as the dependent variable, whereas
Table 2 uses weekly earnings. The results are essentially the same, so our discussion will
focus on the results shown in Table 1.
As shown in column 1 of the panel labeled “Long-term unemployment,” the lagged
dependent variable has a coefficient of 0.7106, consistent with interpreting this regression
specification as a wage curve rather than a Phillips curve; cf. Card (1995). The estimated
coefficient of -0.0279 on the unemployment rate is negative and statistically significant, as
indicated by the t-statistic of about 7. A simple computation indicates that the long-run
unemployment elasticity of pay is -0.10, implying that a doubling of the unemployment rate
is associated with a 10 percent decline in real wages.14 As shown in column 2, these findings
are not sensitive to the precise timing of the unemployment measure (using the rate in period
t-1 instead of period t).15 Moreover, the results reported here are essentially the same as what
Blanchflower and Oswald (2005) found across many countries and datasets as well as the
conclusions of Nikjamp and Poot (2005) in a meta-analysis of wage curve estimates.16

12

Respondents in the CPS are surveyed for four consecutive months (waves 1-4), and then after a four-month
break are surveyed for another four months (waves 5-8). The wage questions are asked only in waves 4 and 8,
which are referred to as the “outgoing rotations.” Each of the annual MORG files has approximately 170,000
wage observations. Data are aggregated to the level of state and year cell including both hourly and weekly
earnings as well as variables on age, gender, race, and schooling. This is exact aggregation and solves the
Moulton problem. So a gender variable in the micro data file becomes a variable identifying the proportion of
workers in a state in a particular year, and so on for the other variables. Mapped onto the file are data from the
BLS on the participation rate as well as the proportion of the employed that is part time for economic reasons as
well as the number of the unemployed who have been unemployed for less than 26 weeks, 26-52 weeks, and
more than 52 weeks.
13

Each regression includes the 19 personal control variables described in the previous footnote, as well as a
lagged dependent variable that helps mitigate biases of uncertain sign and magnitude that could result from
aggregation or missing variables. The start date of January 1990 is determined by the availability of the labor
market status variables, whereas the wage data is available for prior years.

14

Specifically, this elasticity is computed as -0.0279/(1 – 0.7106) = 0.0964.

15

Likewise, as shown in Table 2, we obtain similar results when we use weekly earnings as the measure of
nominal wage growth.
16

Blanchflower and Oswald (1995, p. 357) stated: “Future work will have to begin to test for statistically
significant differences among numbers that lie in a rough band from -0.05 to -0.20. It would probably be
unwise to treat the minus-point-one rule as more than one of thumb.”

10
The remaining columns of this panel confirm the findings of Blanchflower and Posen (2014).
In particular, these regressions incorporate various measures of long-term unemployment that
are never statistically significant. Evidently, the pace of wage growth is linked to the overall
level of unemployment and does not depend on its composition, ie., the relative incidence of
long-term vs. short-term unemployment.
The second section of the table called “Underemployment” provides some new results. As
shown in the first two columns, the nonparticipation rate (that is, 100 minus the participation
rate) has a negative and significant effect on wage growth, consistent with the findings of
Blanchflower and Posen (2014).17 Next, we incorporate the underemployment rate, i.e., the
number of workers who say they are working part time for economic reasons as a percentage
of total employment (as shown in figure 6). This coefficient estimate is also negative and
significant, and its inclusion does not influence the statistical significance of the other key
variables.18
Thus, we see that wage growth is pushed down by the unemployment rate, the
nonparticipation rate, and the underemployment rate. Thus, while the unemployment rate
may have been an adequate indicator of slack prior to the onset of the Great Recession, these
other forms of labor market slack appear to be crucial in interpreting the sluggishness of
nominal wage growth over the past few years, as shown in Figure 1.19
Figure 7 presents our interpretation of the relationship between nominal wage growth and the
“true” unemployment rate (including underemployment and nonparticipation). In particular,
we suspect that the wage curve is relatively flat at elevated levels of labor market slack, i.e., a
decline in slack does not generate any significant wage pressures as long as the level of slack
17

Paciorek (2015) found that many individuals who are out of the labor force appear to be relatively good
candidates for construction employment, at least on the basis of their demographic characteristics. In particular,
he suggests there may be “a large pool of people who would find construction work attractive but did not enter
the industry during the bust years.”
18
19

The results are essentially the same in Table 2 using weekly earnings.

See Bell and Blanchflower (2013a, 2013b, 2014) for further analysis of underemployment in the United
Kingdom based on preferences over hours. Workers are asked in the Labour Force Survey, which is the
equivalent of the Current Population Survey (CPS) in the United States, if they want more or fewer hours.
These responses can be aggregated to the economy level. From 2000 to 2008 there was essentially no
underemployment as the number of hours of those who wanted more hours approximately equaled the number
of hours of those who wanted fewer hours. Since 2008 the numbers who want more hours dominate to such a
degree that underemployment currently is approximately 1.8 percent on top of the unemployment rate itself. It
also turns out that one-third of the extra hours currently come from full-time workers, suggesting the measure
we use in the United States is an underestimate of the true amount of underemployment by around 50 percent.
The likelihood is that when the economy returns to full employment these “desired” additional hours will
disappear.

11
remains large. As noted above, our benchmark analysis indicates that the true unemployment
rate is currently around 7½ percent—a notable decline from its peak of more than 10 percent
but still well above its longer-run normal level of around 5 percent. Thus, the shape of the
wage curve can explain why nominal wage growth has remained stagnant at around 2 percent
over the past few years even as the employment gap has diminished substantially. Moreover,
our interpretation suggests that nominal wages will not begin to accelerate until labor market
slack diminishes substantially further and and the true unemployment rate approaches its
longer-run normal level of around 5 percent.
4. Monetary Policy Implications
No macroeconomic model provides a completely satisfactory description of any economy in
the real world. Indeed, the limitations of existing macroeconomic models have been
underscored by the incidence of relatively large and persistent forecast errors in many
advanced economies over the past few years.20 Thus, rather than relying on the monetary
policy implications of any single macroeconomic model, it seems sensible to consider simple
reference rules that provide reasonably robust performance across a range of plausible
models. Such rules can serve as valuable benchmarks in the decision-making process and in
explaining those decisions to the public.21
Following the seminal analysis of Taylor (1993), a simple rule-of-thumb for adjusting the
level of the federal funds rate can be expressed as a weighted sum of four components: the
equilibrium real interest rate, the actual inflation rate, the inflation gap (that is, the deviation
of inflation from the central bank’s inflation objective), and the level of resource slack.22
We discuss each of these components in turn.
The equilibrium real interest rate ( ) is defined as the short-term real interest rate at which
the economy evolves along its balanced-growth path and inflation remains stable at the
central bank’s objective. As with other properties of the balanced-growth path, the value of
cannot be directly measured but must be inferred from observed economic and financial
data. In our analysis, the value of
is given by the consensus outlook in the Philadelphia

for the average value of the 3-month Treasury bill rate less the PCE inflation rate. Thus,
using the results of the latest SPF (published in February 2015), we set
= 1.25 percent.23
Inflation and the inflation gap. The FOMC has established an inflation objective of 2
percent, expressed in terms of the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).
In measuring actual inflation, we mitigate the influence of transitory price shocks by focusing
on the 12-month percent change in the core PCE price index (that is, excluding food and
energy prices). In the latest reading, this measure of inflation was 1.31 percent, and hence
the inflation gap was 0.69 percent.
Resource slack. In light of our foregoing analysis, we measure resource slack in terms of the
total employment gap. In addition to our benchmark estimate, we consider the implications
of several alternative assessments of labor market slack.
For the sake of brevity, our analysis focuses on one specific rule-of-thumb that was analyzed
extensively by Taylor (1999). This rule prescribes the level of the federal funds rate as the
weighted sum of the equilibrium real interest rate, the current inflation rate, the inflation gap,
and the level of resource slack, with weights of 1.0, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.0, respectively. This
specification has been shown to provide a reasonably balanced approach to fostering the
stability of inflation and economic activity, and hence Yellen (2012) characterized it as
the “balanced approach rule.”
As shown in Table 3, this policy rule prescribes a target federal funds rate of about a quarter
of a percent using our benchmark estimate of the employment gap. However, the implied
funds rate is notably lower for other reasonable assessments. Indeed, using the potential
labor force projection of CBO from February 2013 (illustrated in Figure 4) along with a
natural rate of 4.8 percent (consistent with analysts’ pre-crisis projections), the employment
gap is nearly twice as high at around 4 percent, and the funds rate prescription is nearly 2
percentage points below zero.
.

23

This value of the equilibrium real interest rate is about 25 basis points lower than the median of FOMC
participants’ longer-run real interest rate projections in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections
(published in mid-March).
