CROSS-STATE VARIATION IN
MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND
FEMALE LABOR SUPPLY

ABSTRACT
Although the Medicaid program is partially controlled by the federal government, there

is considerable latitude in the ability of states to set eligibility requirements and the types of
services available to recipients. This research examines the impact of different state Medicaid

programs on the decision to enter the labor force and the number of hours worked by female
heads of households. A pooled cross-section data set constructed from the 1988 through 1993
Current Population Survey March Supplements is used to test if different benefit levels across

states impact labor supply behavior. This study adds to the existing Medicaid literature by
incorporating new benefit measures and explicitly controlling for state random and fixed effects.

OLS results support the prediction that Medicaid expenditures reduce labor supply, but
controlling for state fixed or random effects alters the effect of both the AFDC and Medicaid
programs on both the decision to participate as well as the number of hours worked of female
heads of households. We also consider the effects of policy endogeneity on these estimates using

instruments for state welfare generosity and find evidence that estimates of the effect of welfare

on labor supply are sensitive to the failure to control for time-varying policy endogeneity.

I. Introduction
The issue of the design and effects of government policies aimed at providing

support for children is at the center of an ongoing national debate. Social scientists, policy
makers, and the public at large have all focused their attention on the benefits and, perhaps even

more so, the costs to society of this support network. These costs are perceived to take not just
monetary forms but also to have adverse incentive effects in terms of work, out of wedlock

births, divorce, etc.
Much of this debate has focused on the adverse effects of the cash components of welfare

(Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps), but recently other
programs have become embroiled in this debate. As the costs of health care have risen,
government provided Medicaid benefits have also come under increasing scrutiny. Medicaid
expenditures are one of the fastest rising components of state budgets. State Medicaid spending
more than doubled in real terms between 1980 and 1990, rising from S 19.1 billion to $33.7

billion. Further, state Medicaid expenditures increased even more dramatically in the past few
years rising about 19 percent in 1990-9 1 and 22.5 percent in 199 1-92. Up until the mid 1980s,
Medicaid coverage was primarily limited to recipients of AFDC and indigent senior citizens.
Over the last ten years however, Medicaid coverage has been altered to include individuals with
incomes above the AFDC maximum, primarily pregnant women or children whose parents have

incomes at or slightly above the poverty line. Despite the fact that Medicaid is a federally
mandated program, there is a large amount of latitude as to the number and types of individuals

and services that each state can choose to cover. This state freedom implies that there are
basically 51 different Medicaid programs in the United States, (Washington D.C. also
I

participates in Medicaid). Because of this, there is a large variance in per-recipient Medicaid
expenditures across states. In 1992, for example, annual per-recipient Medicaid expenditures for
AFDC adults ranged from a high of $2,937 in Louisiana to a low of $575 in Mississippi)
Recently, economists and other social scientists have used the cross-state variation in
these programs as a form of "natural experiment" that allows them to access the effectiveness and

adverse incentive effects of these programs. In this paper we use this approach to add to the
literature on the effects of these programs on labor supply. First, we construct three new
measures of the value of Medicaid benefits to adults, children, and families which vaiy across
states and time. These alternate measure will allows us to test for the sensitivity of the

conclusions from previous studies to the measure of Medicaid value used. Previous work on
Medicaid and female labor supply has used measures of state level Medicaid spending which
included spending on the elderly and disabled. Since these group accounts for a substantial share
of all Medicaid expenditures, and they are not randomly distributed across states, this has the

potential to bias the reported results. Second, because there is substantial variation across states
in their labor market characteristics, demographic mixes, and other factors whichare potentially
correlated with both labor supply and benefit generosity, our analysis checks for the sensitivity of

the results to the inclusion of state fixed and random effects. Estimates which control forthese
state specific factors yield substantially different implications for the impact of welfareor
Medicaid on the work decision of women. Finally, given the evidence that cross-state variations
in program design are not uncorrelated with labor market observables, we employ the

instrumental variables technique developed in Besley and Case (1994) to control forpotential
policy endogeneity. The paper is organized as follows: Section II contains some institutional

2

background on Medicaid. Section III is a review of previous work in this area. In Section IV we
discuss the theoretical and empirical models. The data used in this paper and the results ofour
estimation are discussed in Section V. In Section VI conclusions and implications are drawn.

II. Institutional Background on Medicaid
Medicaid, enacted in 1965, was intended to provide health care insurance to low income

individuals. Medicaid expenditures are paid for by both the federal government and the state
governments. The program is essentially an open-ended-matching grant for the coverage of
medical services for certain groups of individuals. The Medicaid eligibility criterionvay by
state but the Categorically Needy (all AFDC recipients and their families) have historically been
eligible for Medicaid in all states.2 Those who leave AFDC because they no longer meet the
income requirement, also continue to receive Medicaid for four months. Some states also allow
individuals who do not meet the AFDC income requirements to quality through a Medically
Needy program. The benefits received under this program are typically less than those for the
Categorically Needy.3 This programs is still means tested but the income and asset requirements
are often higher than for AFDC.4 Finally, changes in the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation
Act (COBRA) in 1989 and 1990 mandated that states phase in an increase in their coverage so
that by 1990 infants and pregnant women would be covered if their household income was up
133 % of the federal poverty level (FPL) and all children under 19 in households with income up

to 100% of the FPL will be eligible by the year 2002. It also allowed states the option to provide
coverage for pregnant women if their household income was up to 185% of the FPL. By 1993,
34 states had availed themselves of this option and 25 of them had increased coverage up to the
3

maximum 185% of the FPL. Although the 1990 expansion only covered these women for

pregnancy services, the net effect of these changes has been to expand the potential pool of
families whose labor supply might be affected by Medicaid.

III. Previous Research
Studies on the effects of government transfer programs designed to provide assistance to
low-income women and children are not new. There has been a voluminous literature on the

incentive effects of AFDC and Food Stamps. Moffitt (1991) provides a detailed discussion of
the effects on labor supply, female headship, and program participation. Most of these studies
seem to find some adverse affect of program participation on female labor supply.

Recently, Blank (1989), Winkler (1991), Moffitt and Wolfe (1992), and Yelowitz (1995)
have extended this literature to examine the impact of the Medicaid program on labor supply.
Although Blank (1989), Winkler (1991), and Moffitt and Wolfe (1992) all find a negative effect

on labor force participation, the size of the effect varies substantially across the studies. Further,
Winkler and Blank fail to find any significant effect on welfare participation of changes in

Medicaid generosity, while Moflitt and Wolfe find a significant effect. Yelowitz(1995) actually
finds that relaxing the eligibility criterion increases labor supply. These differencesmay in part
reflect differences in the measures of Medicaid used in each study. Because Medicaid isan inkind benefit, the proper valuation for a family is problematic and the choice ofappropriate
specification or measure is not straight forward.
Winjcjer (1991) used state level Medicaid expenditures per recipient in her study. This

measure does not allow for any individual heterogeneity in the valuation of the Medicaid

4

insurance variable. Further, because she has only a single cross section she can not control for
state specific effects that may be correlated with both the generosity of benefit and labor supply.
Moffitt and Wolfe (1992) use a family specific health index to construct a measure of potential

utilization of Medicaid coverage. The condition of an individual's health identifies the effects of
Medicaid through the fact that those in poor health will place a higher value of Medicaid
provided health service.5 However, as Yelowitz (1995) notes, the coefficient on this variable
may also capture two other effects of poor heath. First, poor health lowers the worker's marginal
product and hence the wage an AFDC recipient could earn, potentially reducing labor supply.6

Secondly, those in poor health will have a greater marginal disutility of work, or steeper
indifference curves, again potentially reducing labor supply. Thus, the coefficient on this proxy
could be capturing more than the direct effect of Medicaid. Finally, since Moffitt and Wolfe
cannot identify state of residence in their data, they are not able to control for state-specific
factors influencing benefits and labor supply.7

Yelowitz (1995) uses changes in state qualifying income requirements for families with
young chilthen following the legislative changes in the COBRAs of the 1980's and the Family
Support Act (FSA) of 1988. Since states vary in their income eligibility thresholds, and in the
timing of these eligibility changes, these rule changes provide a potentially exogenous source of
variation in these programs within and across states. While this variable will capture the effect
of variation in Medicaid on the extensive (eligibility) margin, it does not capture the effects of
variation on the intensive (generosity or spending) margin. This distinction is theoretically
important as the effect on labor supply of an expansion in benefit eligibility should lead to an
increase in participation ( although the effect on hours is ambiguous), while the latter would lead
5

to a reduction in participation. Thus, the margin over which the effects of Medicaid operate in the
Yelowitz (1993) is fundamentally different from the margin examined here or in the papers by
Moffitt and Wolfe (1994) and Wink.ler (1991 ).8

It should be noted that spending measures like

those used in Winkler (1991) will capture increases in both the number of eligible recipients
(take up rate) and in the generosity of this program. The total impact of this program on labor
supply depends on induced variations on both margins. Further, since these changes in eligibility
standards applied only to households with very young children or infants, they may not be highly
correlated with cross-state and individual differences in the valuation of nonmaternity benefits
which would affect the behavior of the majority of Medicaid recipients.9

IV. Theoretical and Empirical Model

Moffitt (1983), Blank (1989), Winkler (1991), and Yelowitz (1993) contain detailed
discussions of the effects of welfare and Medicaid on the family budget constraint and labor

supply. Following Moffitt (1983), let the utility function take the form U(H, Y, P) where H is
hours, Y is disposable income, and P is an indicator of welfare participation. In the presence of
welfare stigma effects, utility is increasing in income but decreasing in hours worked and

participation. The budget constraint takes the form:

Y=WH(l-r1P)+N(l..t1p)÷p.Q
where W is net or after tax wages, N is nonlabor income,

(1)
is the AFDC implicit programmatic

tax rate on earnings, and 0 is the sum of the value of AFDC and Medicaid benefits. Since

6

Medicaid is an in-kind benefit, this value should be the insurance value of the Medicaid
expenditures rather than the cash value of the benefit. The labor supply function for the family
that maximizes utility will be:

H=H(W(1-r1P),N(1-r1P)+P•G)

(2)

We estimate a reduced form variant of this model where we consider labor supply on both the

intensive and extensive margins. The decision to work can be expressed as follows:

LFP, =

X,, +

where LFP = 1 if LFP,

BEN, ÷ Med +

(3)

0; and LFP = 0 otherwise. LFP1, is a latent index of the gain in

utility from participating in the market. LFP is equal to I for workers. The vector X,, includes
measures such as age, and its square, years of education (and its square), years of education
beyond high school, if a high school graduate (Edyrgtl2), number of years of education below
high school, if educational level is below a high school education (Edyrlt8), a dummy variable

equal to one if the person was African-American (RACE), number of children (Kids), number of
children under six (Kusix), nonlabor income (Niabor) and dummies for divorced (Div) or
separated (Sep). BEN is a vector of state welfare benefits levels and includes the state level

maximum monthly values for a family of three on AFDC (AFDC), Food Stamps (FOOD) and a
dummy variable MN which equals one if the state has a medically needy program. MED is a

measure of real state level Medicaid spending. The error term e is normally distributed with
mean zero and unit variance.

7

The probability that a woman will work can be written as:

Prob( LFP,1 = 1) = Prob (

(-3 X1 - 2 BEN, -

(4)

Med,,)

where 'I is the cumulative normal density fimction. Equation (4) was estimated as a probit

model.
The second aspect of labor supply is the determination of the intensive variation or the

number of hours worked. To estimate this model we follow Heckman (1980) and estimate a
two-step model. The first stage equation uses the probit estimates of equation (4) to construct a

sample selection correction, the inverse of the Mills ratio, A, which is then added to the hours
equation:

is annual hours worked for those that H1,> 0 and the error term, u is normally

distiibuted with zero mean and unit variance. As there are unlikely to be any variables affecting
labor supply on the intensive margin that do not affect it on the extensive margin, our second
stage equation is identified by the nonlinearity of the functional form.'°

V. Data
The models in equations (3) and (4) were estimated using individual data drawn from the
1988-1993 March Supplement files of the Current Population Survey (CPS). In order to make
the study comparable to earlier work, the sample was restricted to single females between the

8

ages of 18 and 65 years old with at least one child under age 15. For the purposes of this study
single-females were defined as those who were divorced, separated, or never married. The data
set contained 21 ,229 observations. The state level AFDC and Medicaid data were drawn from
various issues of the House Ways and Means Committee Green Book. The data set included

forty-nine states and the District of Columbia)' All dollar values were deflated using the
Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Because previous research suggests that estimates may be sensitive to the choice of
Medicaid measure used, we tried a number of different measures. The Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) provides state level Medicaid spending estimates for both AFDC adults
and children. These measures subtract from state total Medicaid spending those amounts which
go to the elderly, blind, and disabled populations. Since the focus of this paper is on the labor
supply of women age 15-65, using Medicaid expenditures on non-targeted groups could give a
misleading indication of cross-state variation in the generosity of benefits. This potential

distortion is quite substantial as seen by the fact that real spending per AFDC recipient in 1992
was in $575 in Mississippi but rises dramatically to $1809 when the elderly and disabled are
included. We check the sensitivity of previous results to their measure of Medicaid by using not
only the average state expenditure per recipient (PRMCAID) construct of Winkler and Blank, but
a measure of average Medicaid spending on AFDC adults (Medadult), children (Medchild), and a
scaled family Medicaid (Medfam = Medadult + 3* Medchild) variable.'2
Summary statistics for all the variables used in the analysis are presented in Table I.
About 68 percent of the female household heads in our sample work, and the average work week
is almost 26 hours. About a third of the sample is on AFDC and the mean monthly benefit for
9

recipients over this period was $262. The mean monthly value of state Medicaid expenditures per

recipient (PRMCAID) was $92, while the mean value of family Medicaid benefits (Medfam) is
$126. This suggests that on a cash expenditure basis, Medicaid health insurance for the average
welfare family has a value of almost 50 percent of the value of the cash benefits received from
the program. Clearly, this program represents a potentially important source of noncash income

for recipients.
In Table 2 we present the results of estimating the probit employment (columns 1-4) and
hours equations (columns 5-8) from equations (3) and (4), respectively using the different

Medicaid variables discussed above. The estimated hours and employment equations yield
results similar to those found in other studies with regards to the effects of our demographic

variables. We find consistent evidence that higher AFDC spending reduces both employment
and hours. Further, living in a state with a Medically Needy program (MN) reduces the
likelihood of participating in the labor force and the average hours worked per week.
As found in Winkler (1991) and Moffitt and Wolfe (1992), Medicaid expenditures

(PRMCAID) have a negative and significant effect on employment. Our results differ from
Winkler, however, in that we also find a significant effect on hours. These results are remarkably
robust to alternate constructs of the Medicaid variable. The economic significance of these
variables can be seen in Table 3 where we calculate the marginal effects and elasticities for each -

of the Medicaid and AFDC variables. The economic importance of the AFDC and Medicaid
variables seems roughly constant across the specifications. The magnitudes are such that a $26
increase in monthly AFDC benefits (about 10 percent) would reduce the labor force participation

rate by about .6 percentage points (about I percent). This estimate is at the low end of the range
10

of estimates of the impact of such a change in AFDC benefits found in Winkler (1990), where a

10 percent increase in AFDC reduced labor force participation between .8 and 1.5 percentage
points. The effect of a 10 percent increase in monthly Medicaid spending would be to reduce
labor force participation by about .36 percentage points. Thus, despite having a statistically
significant effect, these results do n.ot suggest that the magnitude of the impact of these welfare

programs on labor force participation is large. We also find evidence that the estimated
elasticities for hours are quite small. A 10 percent increase in monthly AFDC benefits or
Medicaid expenditures would reduce hours worked by between .11 and .25 percent (between .04

and .10 hours per week). Thus, these pooled cross section results suggest a small but significant
effect of both parts of the welfare program on both the intensive and extensive margins of labor
supply.
Since work by Moffitt and others suggest that welfare effects on household formation
differ for blacks (is larger), we also interacted these welfare measures with our racial indicator to

see if there were differential labor supply effects.'3 Although controlling for observables black
women tend to work less than whites, the adverse effects of AFDC and Medicaid on labor supply
is limited to whites. While AFDC, and each of the Medicaid variables, are negative and

significant for whites, the black interaction terms were strongly positive, significant, and large
enough in magnitude to suggest that these programs have no adverse effect on labor supply. If
anything these results suggest that Medicaid enhances labor force participation and hours
worked for black women.'4

The estimation approach used in these estimates exploits the cross-state variation

in programmatic design to identi' the effects on labor supply. As discussed in Moffitt (1994)
11

and Hoynes (1995), states may differ in social or cultural norms or other unobserved factors
which could be correlated with the level of their welfare benefits.'5 If these unobserved

differences across states are correlated with both program generosity and labor supply, OLS
estimates could be biased. If states that are wealthier have both more generous welfare benefits
and lower labor supply, then our results might show a spurious inverse correlation between labor

supply and benefits. The failure to control for unobserved state effects may significantly bias the
estimated impact of state welfare programmatic variables on behavior. Moffitt (1994) and
Hoynes (1995) found that including controls for state effects in a model of female headship
reversed the positive effect of welfare found in OLS estimates.

Given this, we modeled this heterogeneity two ways to reflect the presence of either

unobserved state random or fixed effects. In the random effects case, the estimated probit or
OLS coefficients would be consistent, but inefficient as the standard errors on the group or state
level variables will be too small. Ainemiya (1978) and Borjas and Sueyoshi (1994) developed
conceptually similar two-step estimators for random effects models for the OLS and probit
specifications.

The first stage involves regressing the individual variables and a set of state specific
intercepts on labor force participation or hours. In the second stage generalized least squares is

used to regress the state specific intercepts on the state specific variables. These results from
estimating our models using this two step process for employment (columns 1-4) and hours
(columns 5-8) are reported in Table 4. Since the second stage errors may be non-spherical
(heteroskedastic), we report White-corrected standard errors for the second stage model.

In the random effects specification, the welfare programmatic variables appear to have
12

somewhat different impacts on the intensive and extensive margins. While AFDC and Food
Stamps have an adverse (and significantly) affect on hours, they do not appear to be significantly

related to labor force participation. Interestingly, the presence of a Medically Needy program
now has a positive effect on both labor force participation and hours where the reverse was true
in the OLS. There is no evidence that Medicaid expenditures adversely affect hours worked in
these random effect specifications. Further, in only two of the four specifications do we find
evidence that Medicaid adversely affects participation. The magnitude of point estimates of the
effects of Medicaid on labor force participation are less than half those found in OLS estimates.

If state effects are fixed rather than random, then the error terms in our
participation and hours models would be:

e, =d, +

(6)

or

u= d1+c13

(7)

where d, is a state fixed effect and the new error terms O and

are i.i.d. normal with zero

mean and unit variance.
To test for time invariant factors that differ across states, we re-estimated our models

including state fixed effects. These results are reported in Table 5 for employment (columns 2-5)
and hours (columns 6-9). We can not reject the hypothesis that the state fixed effects matter in

our model. For instance, the Chi-squared statistics for the inclusion of the state fixed effects in
models 1 and 4 were 424.06 and 435.74, respectively, in the labor force participation equation. In

models I and 4 for the hours equations the F-statistics were 2.96 and 3.01 respectively)6
13

Further, Hausman tests for each of our Medicaid models reject the random effects specification
in favor of the fixed effects.'7
When fixed effects were included in the hours equations, the coefficient on the Food
Stamps policy variable reverses sign. Strikingly, once we control for state effects, the AJ7DC

measure is no longer significant in the either the employment or hours equation, and its sign is
actually reversed in many of the employment equations. The point estimates and elasticities
(Table 3) of the impact of AFDC on hours are reduced by 19- 42 percent in the fixed effect
specifications. This result suggests that state specific variation in unobserved factors which
determine labor supply variation account for a substantial part of the previously estimated effect

of AFDC on labor supply. Previous estimates that failed to incorporate this cross-state
heterogeneity would seriously overestimate the disincentive effects of welfare and Medicaid on

labor supply.
The estimates for the Medicaid variables now prove generally insignificant in the hours

specifications, and in one case even switches sign. Similarly, once we control for state fixed
effects, all the measures of Medicaid tend to lose their significance in the employment
regressions. As seen in Table 3, the magnitude of the elasticities and marginal effects estimates
in the hours and participation equations are consistently reduced and in many cases go from

negative to positive. As with the AFDC variables, these results suggest that a significant amount
of the previously estimated impact of welfare programs on labor supply is due to time invariant

unobserved state effects.'8
Finally, we explore a potential explanation for the source of the unobserved state effects.
Besley and Case (1994) suggest that the inclusion of state effects may not remove unobserved
14

heterogeneity bias from models using cross-state variation in polices to identify individual policy
treatment effects. Moffitt (1994) suggests that the state level effects may reflect policy
endogeneity arising from the political process when state program generosity reflects state
economic performance. As Besley and Case (1994) suggest, failure to control for these time
varying unobserved state specific factors may lead to bias in the type of cross-state "natural"

experiment that we are attempting.
If policy endogeneity is a major concern, then the various measures of welfare generosity
(AFDC, Medicaid, and Food Stamps) will be correlated with the error in the labor supply

equation. The potential endogeneity of welfare benefits, Ben, ,can be expressed as a function of
the variables that determine labor supply, a set of other exogenous variables that are orthogonal

to the error in the labor supply equations, Z, and an error term E2j or:

Ben,, =

+

Z, +

(8)

Given the consistency in the direction of the effects of the individual components of welfare, and
since the policy endogeneity with respect to each of the components of welfare is likely to have a
common source, we follow Moffitt (1994) in aggregating the welfare measures into a composite
dollar equivalent expenditures. The set of instruments, Z,1, that we use are three political
variables that Besley and Case (1994) found to be exogenous in estimates of the effect of state
specific disability programs on employment and earnings (percent of Democrats in the State
House and Senate and whether the governor is a Democrat).
To insure that the qualitative nature of our previous results are not influenced by the

aggregation of the three components of welfare into a composite, we first re-estimated our single
15

equation models with and without fixed effects using the aggregate welfare constructs)9 Those
results are presented in Table 6. As can clearly be seen, all the welfare aggregates have a
negative and statistically significant correlation with labor force participation and hours worked.

Similarly, the addition of the state fixed effects dramatically reduces the estimated coefficients
on the welfare variables, and we can not reject the null hypothesis that they affect both of our
labor supply measures. Thus, the qualitative nature of our previous results are not sensitive to the
use of an aggregate welfare measure.
In Table 7 we present the results of our instrumental variable estimation of the effects of
welfare on labor supply. Given the discrete nature of the labor force participation variable, the
instrumental variables (IV) estimation of the employment equation involves the estimation of the
simultaneous log likelihood function for each woman where the likelihood function represents
both the single equation probit model for participation and the linear least squares model of
benefit generosity under the assumption that the errors in these two equations each are bivariate
normal with mean zero and covariance E •20

As in the single equation models, the inclusion of fixed effects dramatically reduces the
size and significance of the coefficients on the impact of the welfare variable on labor supply.
While the effect of controlling for fixed unobserved state heterogeneity appears to reduce the
estimated impact of the program variable, controlling for policy endogeneity appears to increase

the estimate impact. The coefficients on the welfare measures in the IV employment equations
(Table 7 column 2) with fixed effects are over 10 times bigger than the single equation results

with fixed effects. Interestingly, the IV models with fixed effect yield parameter estimates only
slightly smaller than the single equation models with no controls for state heterogeneity. While
16

these coefficents are still not precisely estimated, they may suggest that magnitude of the bias in

the single equation models that do not control for state heterogeneity is not as great as the fixed

effects estimates would imply.

The effect of instrumenting for state heterogeneity appears to be even stronger in the

hours equations. In contrast to the single equation results, we flhd that welfare still has a
statistically significant adverse effect on hours in the fixed effect specification and that the fixed
effects IV coefficients are even larger than the single equation estimates with no fixed effects.

These results are supportive of the presence of policy endogeneity in the determination of state
welfare benefits. These results suggest that unobserved political factors which generate more
Democrats in state government tend to occur in states where employment is lower and welfare
benefits are more generous. Of course, the increase in the magnitude of the IV coefficients is
also consistent with the presence of measurement error (attenuation) bias in the welfare

measures. Recall that the welfare measure should include Medicaid valuations for the individual
(the insurance value) rather than the cash value measures used here. Thus, it seems plausible that
measurement error causes an underestimate of the effect of these programs on labor supply.

To strengthen our confidence the IV results, we undertook two addition tests. First,
Bound et a! (1994) have shown that IV estimates may yield even more inconsistent estimates that
OLS estimation if the correlation between the instrument and endogenous variable is weak. The
results from estimating the first stage equation(8) with fixed state effects are presented in Table
8. They clearly indicate that the instruments are highly correlated with the endogenous welfare
variable. The t-statistics for each of the instruments are quite large and indicate significance at
the 5 percent level or better in all of the models, even the fixed effect ones. Secondly, since we
17

have three instruments for our welfare measure we were able to performs tests of overidentifing
restriction or that the political variables (instruments) do not belong in the labor supply equation.
The results of the overidentification tests for the models with fixed effects are presented in Table

9.' In only one of the 8 estimated models do we fail to reject the hypothesis that these political
variable have an independent effect on the labor supply behavior of single women. Taken as a
whole these IV results suggest that the failure to control unobserved state policy endogeneity
again leads to biased estimates. Our evidence suggests that fixed effect models will lead to
underestimates of the effect of welfare on labor supply.

VI. Summary and Conclusions
In this paper we examine the effects of various elements of the government support
network on labor supply. We exploit cross-state variation in the structure of these programs and
control for state random and fixed effects that may have biased previous cross section estimates

using state level benefit measures. Given the recent growth in both Medicaid spending and
eligibility, we focus primarily on the Medicaid program.
Estimates of the effects of the Medicaid and other welfare programmatic variables were

sensitive to the treatment of area or state effects. In molels without controls for these effect, we
found that all of the welfare variables had strong negative effects on employment, and, to a lesser
degree, hours. The adverse effect of welfare on labor supply seems limited to whites in these
models, despite the higher participation rate of blacks in these programs. In models with state
fixed or random effects these variables were consistently found to have weaker or no significant
adverse effect on employment and hours.

The role of policy endogeneity is explored through the uses of state level political

variables as instruments for the welfare variables. These variables were found to be strongly
correlated with within and across state variations in benefit levels, and to be orthogonal to the
unobserved component of state welfare benefit generosity which is correlated with labor supply.
The fact that the IV estimates are actually larger in the employment and fixed effect hours
models is suggestive of the fact it is important to control for both unobserved fixed and time

varying state specific effects when modeling the impact of these welfare programs on labor
supply.

ENDNOTES
1.

Author's calculations based on data supplied by the Health Care Financing Administration.

2.

SSI recipients may also be judged Categorically Needy and hence eligible for Medicaid. The
1990 Supreme Court decision in the Sullivan vs Zebly case broaden eligibility under SSI to include
disabled children. The Congressional Research Service estimates that this increased the number of
such children on Medicaid by 125,000. Given that these children account for less than 1 percent of
the 14.3 million children receiving Medicaid in 1990, we follow Blank (1989) and exclude SSJ
recipients from consideration. See" Medicaid: Recent Trends in Beneficiaries and Spending" Report
for Congress, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1992.

3. Thirty six states have adopted the Medically Needy program.
4. The Medically Needy income level can be set up to 133 percent of the AFDC maximum. It
should be noted that seven (7) states actually set the threshold lower than the AFDC threshold.

5. In a paper on the effects of welfare on headship, Moffitt (1994) uses the sum of state
expenditures per recipient on Medicaid, AFDC, and Food Stamps in a state as his measure of these
programs.
6. Moffitt and Wolfe (1992) do include the actual wage net of estimated taxes for employed

workers and a measure of the expected net wage for nonparticipants in their regression. The
inclusion of these wage measures cuts their estimate of the adverse labor supply effect of Medicaid
in half. It should be noted, however, that these wage measures do not fully control for this bias

because poor health reduces the actual wage received below its t,otential, unobserved, value.
Workers with identical observed wages, but differing in health status, may still have different labor
supply behaviors because of differences in the size of this unobserved component. This unobserved
gap will be positively correlated with the Medicaid valuation variable, but negatively correlated with

labor supply, yielding an overestimate of the effect of Medicaid. For the nonparticipants, the
expected net wage used in the Moffitt and Wolfe regression is estimated without controlling for the
fact that this expected wage will vary with health status and hence be correlated with their Medicaid
variable and labor supply.

,.

It should be noted that Yelowitz (1995) also contains controls for state fixed effects.

8. Blank (1989) also looks at the effects of expanded eligibility through the creation of the Medically
Needy program.

9. It should of course be noted that the converse holds true for our analysis. By ignoring cross state
variation in the timing of changes in these eligibility criterion, we overlook changes in the expected
value of Medid benefits that may be relevant for the labor supply decisions ofpregnant women
and those withsmajl infants. These would be captured in our variables to some degree if they affect

22

average expenditures across states.
10. As a check on the sensitivity of our results to this assumption, we tried two alternate exclusion
restrictions to gain identification. First, we followed Winkler (1991) and omitted kids under 6 from
the second stage equation. Alternatively, we omitted the dummy variable for separated from the
second stage equation. In both case we got results that are qualitatively similar to those reported in
Tables 2 and 4. Because there seems to be no good theoretical rationale for these exclusion restricts
we report the results without them. The alternate results are available from the authors upon request.

ii. Arizona was excluded because it operates Medicaid as a demonstration project.
12. We also experimented with a family specific Medicaid measure that reflected the actual number
of children in the household. The scaled variable was chosen to avoid potential endogeneity issues
between household size and welfare benefits. It should be noted, however, that the qualitative nature
of the results were not sensitive to the use of scaled as opposed to actual family size.

13. These results are available from the authors upon request.
14. It should be noted that these conclusions about the interaction of race and the Medjcajd variables
are not sensitive to the inclusion of the state fixed effects.

is. Given the fact that we only have pooled cross section data we are not able to examine bias
introduced by unobserved individual effects that may be correlated with the policy variables. If
selective migration induces a common taste for benefits and work then these individual effects could

be correlated with the state and welfare effects. Hoynes (1995) presents evidence, however, that
shows that controlling for state effects is sufficient to capture population heterogeneity across states.
16. The likelihood ratio test had a critical value of 67.22 in the Chi-square test at the 95 percent
level and the F-test had a critical value of 1.34 at the 95 percent level.
17.The tests statistic for the specification using PRMCAID was 14.54 while it was 12.96 in the
specification using Medfam which is well above the critical values for the Chi-squared test with 3
df.
18. Although our results are similar to Moffitt (1994) using CPS data over the period 1968-89, a
concern might be that in the panel our results simply reflect the absence of sufficient within state
variation in these benefits to generate statistically significant effects. As a crude check on this we
regresses our welfare and Medicaid variables on state fixed effects to see how much of the variation
in these variables would remain. The state effects explained between 57 and 77 percent of the
variation in these measures suggesting that while cross state variation is an important component
there is subst.antjal variance in these measures lefl.

23

19. The results from using these aggregate measures and including Heckman corrections in the
hours equations are also qualitatively similar to the disaggregated results. These results are available
from the authors upon request.

20. See Evans, Oates, and Schwab (1992) for a derivation of this likelihood function. Thanks to
William Evans for use of his SAS maximum likelihood estimation routine.
21 .The over identification tests for the labor force participation equation are based 2SLS estimates
where the second stage is a linear probability model.
