    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper reports direct evidence on how recent changes in technology are related to  changes in wage differentials by schooling, experience, and gender.  Wage differentials by industry in the full- year 1979 and 1989 Current Population Surveys are related to R&D intensity, usage of high-tech capital, recentness of technology, growth in total factor productivity, and growth of the capital-labor ratio.  Returns to schooling are larger in industries that are intensive in R&D and high-tech capital.  Technology variables account for 30 percent of the increase in the wage gap between college and high school graduates.\n\n",
