Risk Preferences Are Not Time Preferences: Discounted Expected Utility with a Disproportionate
Preference for Certainty

JEL No. D81,D90
ABSTRACT
Risk and time are intertwined. The present is known while the future is inherently risky. Discounted
expected utility provides a simple, coherent structure for analyzing decisions in intertemporal, uncertain
environments. However, we document robust violations of discounted expected utility, inconsistent
with both prospect theory probability weighting and models with preferences for the resolution of
uncertainty. We find that we can organize our data with surprising precision if we allow for a disproportionate
preference for certainty. These results have potentially important implications for understanding dynamically
inconsistent preferences.

Introduction

Research on decision making under uncertainty has a long tradition. A core of tools
designed to explore risky decisions has evolved, from Savage’s (1954) axioms and the
expected utility (EU) framework.1 There are, however, a number of well-documented
departures from EU such as the Allais (1953) common consequence and common ratio
paradoxes. An organizing principle behind the body of violations of expected utility is
that they seem to arise as so-called ‘boundary effects’ where certainty and uncertainty
are combined. Camerer (1992), Harless and Camerer (1994) and Starmer (2000) indicate that violations of expected utility are notably less prevalent when all choices are
uncertain.
Certainty and uncertainty are combined in intertemporal decisions. The present is
known, while the future is inherently risky. The discounted expected utility (DEU)
model is the standard approach to addressing decision-making in such contexts.
There are noted difficulties with the DEU model related to the timing of the resolution of uncertainty. Preferences on income streams induced from preferences on
consumption streams that follow the EU axioms may depend on the timing of the
resolution of income uncertainty and will not generally have an expected utility formulation (Markowitz, 1959; Mossin, 1969; Spence and Zeckhauser, 1972; Machina, 1984).
Kreps and Porteus (1978), Chew and Epstein (1989), and Epstein and Zin (1989) use
this observation to motivate utility models with preferences for the temporal resolution
of uncertainty.
There is a distinction between these developments and the evidence presented in
this paper. We document violations of expected utility in a setting where uncertainty is
resolved immediately, before further consumption decisions are made.2 The preference
1

Ellingsen (1994) provides a thorough history of the developments building towards expected utility
theory and its cardinal representation.
2
The only evidence of intertemporal violations of EU we are aware of are Baucells and Heukamp
(2009) and Gneezy, List and Wu (2006) who show that temporal delay can generate behavior akin to
the classic common ratio effect and that the so-called ‘uncertainty effect’ is present for hypothetical

1

models of Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Chew and Epstein (1989) and the primary
model classes of Epstein and Zin (1989) “...conform with expected utility theory when
ranking timeless gambles, i.e., those in which uncertainty is resolved before further
consumption takes place” (Epstein and Zin, 1989, p. 948). As such, in our experiment
these models will be equivalent to DEU.3
An implication of the DEU model is that intertemporal allocations should depend
only on relative intertemporal risk. For example, if sooner consumption will be realized
50% of the time and later consumption will be realized 50% of the time, intertemporal
allocations should be identical to a situation where all consumption is risk-free. This
is simply an intertemporal statement of the common ratio property of expected utility.
In an experiment with 80 undergraduate subjects at the University of California,
San Diego, we test intertemporal common ratio predictions using Convex Time Budgets (CTBs) under varying risk conditions (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2009). In CTBs,
individuals are asked to allocate a budget of experimental tokens to sooner and later
payments. CTB allocation decisions are equivalent to intertemporal optimization subject to a linear budget constraint.
We implement CTBs in two baseline risk conditions: 1) A risk-free condition where
all payments, both sooner and later, will be paid 100% of the time; and 2) a risky
condition where, independently, sooner and later payments will be paid only 50% of
the time. All uncertainty was resolved immediately after the allocation decisions were
made, for both sooner and later payments. Under the standard DEU model, CTB
allocations in the two conditions should yield identical choices. The pattern of results
we find clearly violates DEU, and correspondingly resolution-timing preferences, and
is further inconsistent with non-EU concepts such as probability weighting (Kahneman
intertemporal decisions, respectively.
3
Not all of the classes of recursive utility models discussed in Epstein and Zin (1989) will reduce
to expected utility when all uncertainty is resolved immediately. The weighted utility class (Class
3) corresponding to the models of Dekel (1986) and Chew (1989) can accomodate expected utility
violations even without a preference for sooner or later resolution of uncertainty.

2

and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992; Tversky and Fox, 1995) or temporally dependent probability weighting (Halevy, 2008). We document substantial DEU
violations at both the group and individual level. Indeed, 85% of subjects are found
to violate common ratio predictions and do so in more than 80% of opportunities. In
estimations of utility parameters, aggregate discounting is found to be around 30% per
year, and is virtually identical in both the all-safe and all-risky conditions. However,
other utility parameters, such as utility function curvature, are found to differ significantly. Taken at face value, the estimates indicate a disproportionate preference for
certainty.
To explore this result in greater detail, we examine four additional experimental
conditions with differential risk, but common ratios of probabilities. In the first such
condition the sooner payment is paid 100% of the time while the later payment is paid
only 80% of the time. This is compared to a common ratio counterpart where the
sooner payment is paid 50% of the time while the later payment is paid only 40% of
the time. We document violations of the DEU common ratio prediction suggestive
of a disproportionate preference for certainty. We mirror this design with conditions
where the later payment has the higher probability of payment and again document
a disproportionate preference for certainty. The data are organized systematically at
both the group and individual level. Subjects who violate common-ratio predictions in
the baseline 100%-100% and 50%-50% conditions are more likely to violate in the four
additional conditions.
Our results are remarkably in line with the initial intuition for the Allais paradox
and have implications for intertemporal decision theory. Allais (1953, p. 530) argued
that when two options are far from certain, individuals act effectively as expected
utility maximizers, while when one option is certain and another is uncertain a disproportionate preference for certainty prevails. Such an argument may help to explain
the frequent experimental finding of present-biased preferences (Frederick, Loewenstein

3

and O’Donoghue, 2002). That is, certainty, not intrinsic temptation, may lead present
payments to be disproportionately preferred. This view has been argued previously
in prior explorations of present-bias (Halevy, 2008), and is implied in the recognized
dynamic inconsistency of non-expected utility models (Green, 1987; Machina, 1989).
However, our results provide evidence of a different mechanism. Our results point towards so-called u-v preferences as in the models of Neilson (1992), Schmidt (1998), and
Diecidue, Schmidt and Wakker (2004). Such models deliver a representation with standard expected utility u(·) away from certainty, and utility v(·) for certainty, potentially
with u(·) 6= v(·) and the disproportionate preference v(x) > u(x) for x > 0.4
The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents a conceptual development of u-v
preferences and discounted expected utility, building to a testable hypothesis of decision making in uncertain and certain situations. Section 3 describes our experimental
design. Section 4 presents results and Section 5 is a discussion and conclusion.

2

Conceptual Background

We begin by discussing u-v preferences (Neilson, 1992; Schmidt, 1998; Diecidue et al.,
2004). Let v(c) be some utility function for certain consumption and u(c) be a utility
function for uncertain consumption, assumed to be separable and linearly additive
over probabilistic states. Note that the u-v model nests standard expected utility
when u(·) ≡ v(·), yet can accommodate a disproportionate preference for certainty
v(c) > u(c) for c > 0. Hence, standard expected utility is a special case of u-v
preferences with an assumption of interchangeability for u(·) and v(·).

Assumption: Interchangeability.

Individuals evaluate consumption, c, obtained

under certainty and uncertainty in an identical manner, that is u(c) ≡ v(c).

4

For a discussion of the early history of u-v preferences, see Schoemaker (1982).

4

When utility is time separable, interchangeability gives rise to the standard DEU
model,
U=

T
X

δ t+k E[v(ct+k )],

k=0

Simplify to assume two periods, t and t + k, and that consumption at time t will be ct
with probability p1 and zero otherwise, while consumption at time t + k will be ct+k
with probability p2 and zero otherwise. Under the standard construction, utility is
p1 δ t v(ct ) + p2 δ t+k v(ct+k ) + ((1 − p1 )δ t + (1 − p2 )δ t+k )v(0).

Suppose an individual maximizes utility subject to the future value budget constraint

(1 + r)ct + ct+k = m,

yielding the marginal condition
p2
v 0 (ct )
= (1 + r) .
k
0
δ v (ct+k )
p1
The tangency condition, in combination with the budget constraint, yields a solution
ct = c∗t (p1 /p2 ; k, 1 + r, m).
A key observation in this construction is that intertemporal allocations will depend
only on the relative risk, p1 /p2 , and not on p1 or p2 separately. If p1 /p2 = 1, for
p1 = p2 < 1, then behavior should be identical to a risk-free situation, p1 = p2 = 1.
This is a critical and testable implication of the DEU model.

Hypothesis: For any (p1 , p2 ) and (p01 , p02 ) where p1 /p2 = p01 /p02 , c∗t (p1 /p2 ; k, 1+r, m) =
c∗t (p01 /p02 ; k, 1 + r, m).
5

This hypothesis is simply an intertemporal statement of the common ratio property
of expected utility.5 However, it is important to understand the degree to which this
common ratio hypothesis hinges upon interchangeability. If u(c) 6= v(c), then there is
no reason to expect c∗t (p1 /p2 ; k, 1 + r, m) = c∗t (1/1, k, 1 + r, m) when p1 = p2 < 1. This
is because the marginal conditions in the two situations will generally be satisfied at
different allocation levels.6
There exist important utility formulations such as those developed by Kreps and
Porteus (1978), Chew and Epstein (1989), and Epstein and Zin (1989) where the common ratio prediction does not hold. Behavior need not be identical if the uncertainty
of p1 and p2 are resolved at different points in time, and individuals have preferences
over the timing of the resolution of uncertainty. Our experimental design will focus on
cases where all uncertainty is resolved immediately, before any payments are received.
The utility formulations of Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Chew and Epstein (1989),
and the primary classes discussed by Epstein and Zin (1989) will reduce to standard
expected utility. That is, when “... attention is restricted to choice problems/temporal
lotteries where all uncertainty resolves at t = 0, there is a single ‘mixing’ of prizes and
one gets the payoff vector [EU] approach” (Kreps and Porteus, 1978, p. 199).
In our later exposition it will be notationally convenient to use θ to indicate the
risk adjusted gross interest rate:

θ = (1 + r)
5

p2
p1

If individuals face background risk compounded with the objective probabilities, the common
ratio prediction is maintained. This is true even if background risk differs across time periods.
6
In the risky situation the marginal condition will be u0 (ct )/δ k u0 (ct+k ) = (1 + r)p2 /p1 = (1 + r),
while in the risk-free situation the condition will be: v 0 (c0t )/δ k v 0 (c0t+k ) = (1 + r). And c0t = ct ; c0t+k =
ct+k only if the marginal utility functions u0 (·) and v 0 (·) are equal. Though this may occur with
u(·) 6= v(·), it generally will not. Additionally, there is no reason to expect c∗t (p1 /p2 ; k, 1 + r, m) =
c∗t (p01 /1, k, 1 + r, m) when p1 /p2 = p01 and p02 = 1 or c∗t (p1 /p2 ; k, 1 + r, m) = c∗t (1/p02 , k, 1 + r, m) when
p1 /p2 = 1/p02 and p01 = 1.

6

such that the tangency can be written as:
v 0 (ct )
=θ
δ k v 0 (ct+k )
Provided that v 0 (·) > 0, v 00 (·) < 0, c∗t will be increasing in p1 /p2 and decreasing in 1 + r.
As such, c∗t will be decreasing in θ. In addition, for a given θ, c∗t will be decreasing
in 1 + r. An increase in the interest rate will both raise the relative price of sooner
consumption and reduce the available consumption set.

Experimental Design

In order to explore the evaluation of uncertain and certain intertemporal consumption,
an experiment using Convex Time Budgets (CTB) (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2009)
under varying risk conditions was conducted at the Univeristy of California, San Diego
in April of 2009. In each CTB decision, subjects were given a budget of experimental
tokens to be allocated across a sooner payment, paid at time t, and a later payment,
paid at time t + k, k > 0. Two basic CTB environments consisting of 7 allocation
decisions each were implemented under six different risk conditions. This generated a
total of 84 experimental decisions for each subject.

3.1

CTB Design Features

Sooner payments in each decision were always seven days from the experiment date
(t = 7 days). We chose this ‘front-end-delay’ to avoid any direct impact of immediacy on decisions, including resolution timing effects, and to help eliminate differential
transactions costs across sooner and later payments.7 In one of the basic CTB environments, later payments were delayed 28 days (k = 28) and in the other, later payments
7

See below for the recruitment and payment efforts that allowed sooner payments to be implemented in the same manner as later payments. For discussions of front-end-delays in time preference
experiments see Coller and Williams (1999); Harrison, Lau, Rutstrom and Williams (2005).

7

were delayed 56 days (k = 56). The choice of t and k were set to avoid holidays, school
vacation days and final examination week. Payments were scheduled to arrive on the
same day of the week (t and k are both multiples of 7) to avoid differential weekday
effects.
In each CTB decision, subjects were given a budget of 100 tokens. Tokens allocated
to the sooner date had a value of at while tokens allocated to the later date had a value
of at+k . In all cases, at+k was $0.20 per token and at varied from $0.20 to $0.14
per token. Note that at+k /at = (1 + r), the gross interest rate over k days, and
(1 + r)1/k − 1 gives the standardized daily net interest rate. Daily net interest rates
in the experiment varied considerably across the basic budgets, from 0 to 1.3 percent,
implying annual interest rates of between 0 and 2100 percent (compounded quarterly).
Table 1 shows the token values, gross interest rates, standardized daily interest rates
and corresponding annual interest rates for the basic CTB budgets.

The basic CTB decisions described above were implemented in a total of six
risk conditions. Let p1 and p2 be the probabilities that payment would be made
for the sooner and later payments, respectively. The six conditions were (p1 , p2 ) ∈
8

{(1, 1), (0.5, 0.5), (1, 0.8), (0.5, 0.4), (0.8, 1), (0.4, 0.5)}. For all payments involving uncertainty, a ten-sided die was rolled immediately at the end of the experiment to
determine whether the payment would be sent or not. Hence, p1 and p2 were immediately known, independent, and subjects were told that different random numbers
would determine their sooner and later payments.8
The risk conditions have several features. To begin, the first and second conditions
share a common ratio of p1 /p2 = 1, the third and fourth conditions share a common
ratio of p1 /p2 = 1.25, and the fifth and sixth conditions share a common ratio of
p1 /p2 = 0.8. Discounted expected utility predicts identical behavior across each pair of
conditions. Additionally, three of the risk conditions feature at least one certain payment, while the other three feature only uncertainty. If there exists a disproportionate
preference for certainty, it should become apparent in cross-condition comparisons. For
instance, for a given value of θ, subjects should disproportionately prefer the sooner
payment when (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) and the later payment when (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1). Lastly,
across conditions the sooner payment goes from being relatively less risky, p1 /p2 = 1.25,
to relatively more risky, p1 /p2 = 0.8. Following the discussion of Section 2, DEU maximizers should respond to changes in relative risk, allocating smaller amounts to sooner
payments when relative risk is low.

3.2

Implementation and Protocol

One of the most challenging aspects of implementing any time discounting study is
making all choices equivalent except for their timing. That is, transactions costs associated with receiving payments, including physical costs and confidence, must be
equalized across all time periods. We took several unique steps in our subject recruitment process and our payment procedure in an attempt to equate transaction costs
over time.

See Appendix A.3 for the payment instructions provided to subjects.

3.2.1

Recruitment and Experimental Payments

In order to participate in the experiment, subjects were required to live on campus. All
campus residents are provided with individual mailboxes at their dormitories to use
for postal service and campus mail. Each mailbox is locked and individuals have keyed
access 24 hours per day. We recruited 80 undergraduate students fitting this criterion.
All payments, both sooner and later, were placed in subjects’ campus mailboxes
by campus mail services, which allowed us to equate physical transaction costs across
sooner and later payments. Subjects were fully informed of the method of payment.9
Several other measures were also taken to equate transaction costs. Upon beginning
the experiment, subjects were told that they would receive a $10 minimum payment
for participating, to be received in two payments: $5 sooner and $5 later. All experimental earnings were added to these $5 minimum payments. Two blank envelopes
were provided. After receiving directions about the two minimum payments, subjects
addressed the envelopes to themselves at their campus mailbox. At the end of the
experiment, subjects wrote their payment amounts and dates on the inside flap of each
envelope such that they would see the amounts written in their own handwriting when
payments arrived. In sum, these measures serve to ensure that transaction costs, including banking convenience, likelihood of clerical error, and costs of remembering are
equalized across time.
One choice for each subject was selected for payment by drawing a numbered card
at random.10 All experimental payments were made by personal check from Professor
James Andreoni drawn on an account at the university credit union.11 Subjects were
9

See Appendix A.2 for the information provided to subjects.
This randomization device introduces a compound lottery to the decision environment. Reduction
of compound lotteries is assumed for expected utility and does not change the common ratio predictions. Subjects are told to treat each decision as if it were to determine their payments. See Appendix
A.3 for text. In a sense, this encourages subjects to ignore the randomization device. As shown in
Section 4, the results demonstrate behavior that is suggestive of individuals treating experimental
certainty differently than other probabiltiies.
11
Payment choice was guided by a separate survey of 249 undergraduate economics students eliciting payment preferences. Personal checks from Professor Andreoni, Amazon.com gift cards, PayPal
transfers and the university stored value system TritonCash were each compared to cash payments.
10

10

informed that they could cash their checks (if they so desired) at the university credit
union. They were also given the business card of Professor James Andreoni and told
to call or email him if a payment did not arrive and that a payment would be handdelivered immediately.

3.2.2

Instrument and Protocol

The experiment was done with paper and pencil. Upon entering the lab subjects were
read an introduction with detailed information on the payment process and a sample
decision with different payment dates, token values and payment risks than those used
in the experiment.12 Subjects were informed that they would work through 6 decision
tasks. Each task consisted of 14 CTB decisions: seven with t = 7, k = 28 on one
sheet and seven with t = 7, k = 56 on a second sheet. Each decision sheet featured
a calendar, highlighting the experiment date, and the sooner and later payment dates,
allowing subjects to visualize the payment dates and delay lengths.
Figure 1 shows a decision sheet. Identical instructions were read at the beginning
of each task providing payment dates and the chance of being paid for each decision.
Subjects were provided with a calculator and a calculation sheet transforming tokens
to payment amounts at various token values.

Subjects were asked if they would prefer a twenty dollar payment made via each payment method or
$X cash, where X was varied from 19 to 10. Personal checks were found to have the highest cash
equivalent value. That is, the highest average value of $X.

Four sessions were conducted over two days. Two orders of risk conditions were
implemented to examine order effects.13 Each day consisted of an early session (12
p.m.) and a late session (2 p.m.). The early session on the first day and the late
session on the second day share a common order as do the late session on the first day
and the early session on the second day. No identifiable order or session effects were
found (see Section 4.1).

Results

The results are presented in two sub-sections. First, we examine behavior in the two
baseline conditions: (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5). We document violations
of the DEU model’s common ratio prediction at both aggregate and individual levels
and show a pattern of results that is generally incompatible with various probability
weighting concepts. In estimates of utility parameters, we show a clear difference between the utility functions for certain and uncertain outcomes, indicating a disproportionate preference for certainty. Second, we explore behavior in four further conditions
where common ratios maintain but only one payment is certain. Subjects exhibit a
disproportionate preference for certainty when it is available, but behave consistently
with expected utility maximization away from certainty.

4.1

Behavior Under Certainty and Uncertainty

Section 2 provided a testable hypothesis for behavior across certain and uncertain
intertemporal settings. For a given (p1 , p2 ), if p1 = p2 < 1 then behavior should be
identical to a similarly dated risk-free prospect, (p1 = p2 = 1), at all gross interest rates,
13

In one order, (p1 , p2 ) followed the sequence (1, 1), (1, 0.8), (0.8, 1), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.4), (0.4, 0.5),
while in the second it followed (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.4), (0.4, 0.5), (1, 1), (1, 0.8), (0.8, 1). This, of course,
does not exhaust the possible order effects, but the strength of the results suggests that order is
unlikely to qualitatively affect the findings.

13

1 + r, and all delay lengths, k.14 Figure 2 graphs aggregate behavior for the conditions
(p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) (blue diamonds) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5) (red squares) across the
experimentally varied gross interest rates and delay lengths. The mean earlier choice
of ct is graphed along with error bars corresponding to 95 percent confidence intervals
(+/− 1.96 standard errors).
Under the DEU model, behavior should be identical across the two conditions. We
find strong evidence to the contrary. In a hypothesis test of equality across the two
conditions, the overall difference is found to be highly significant: F14,79 = 6.07, p <
.001.15
The data follow an interesting pattern. Behavior in both (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and
(0.5, 0.5) conditions respect increasing interest rates. Allocations to sooner payments
decrease as interest rates rise. At the lowest interest rate, ct allocations are substantially
higher in the (1, 1) condition. However, as the gross interest rate increases, (1, 1)
allocations drop steeply, crossing over the graph of the (0.5, 0.5) condition.16 This
cross-over in behavior is in clear violation of discounted expected utility and all models
that reduce to discounted expected utility when uncertainty is immediately resolved.
Though this is suggestive evidence against interchangeability, we must first consider
possible alternative explanations. Principal among these is Prospect Theory and, in
particular, non-linear probability weighting (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky
and Kahneman, 1992; Tversky and Fox, 1995).
Probability weighting states that individuals ‘edit’ probabilities internally via a
weighting function, π(p). Though π(p) may take a variety of forms, it is often argued
14

We ignore m because the experimental budget was held constant across all choices.
Test statistic generated from non-parametric OLS regression of choice on indicators for interest
rate (7 levels), delay length (2 levels), risk condition (2 levels) and all interactions with clustered
standard errors. F-statistic corresponds to null hypothesis that all risk condition terms have zero
slopes. See Appendix Table A1 for regression.
16
Indeed, in the (1, 1) condition, 80.7 percent of allocations are at one or the other budget corners
while only 26.1 percent are corner solutions in the (0.5, 0.5) condition. We interpret the corner
solutions in the (1, 1) condition as evidence consistent with separability. See Andreoni and Sprenger
(2009) for a full discussion of censoring issues in CTBs. The difference in allocations across conditions
is obtained for all sessions and for all orders indicating no presence of order or day effects.

to be monotonically increasing in the interval [0, 1], with an inverted S -shaped, such
that low probabilities are up-weighted and high probabilities are down-weighted (Wu
and Gonzalez, 1996; Prelec, 1998; Gonzalez and Wu, 1999). Probability weighting
of this or any form is unable to explain the phenomena observed in Figure 2. If
p1 = p2 , then necessarily π(p1 ) = π(p2 ), and π(p1 )/π(p2 ) = 1 as before. As in the DEU
model, probability weighting predicts behavior to be identical across our experimental
conditions.

15

Another potential explanation is that probabilities are weighted by their temporal
proximity (Halevy, 2008). Under this formulation, subjective probabilities are arrived
at through some temporally dependent function g(p, t) : [0, 1] × <+ → [0, 1] where
t represents the time at which payments will be made. Provided freedom to pick
the functional form of g(·) one could easily arrive at differences between the ratios
g(1, t)/g(1, t + k) and g(0.5, t)/g(0.5, t + k).17
These differences lead to a new risk adjusted interest rate similar to the θ defined
in Section 2,
θ̃p1 ,p2 ≡

g(p2 , t + k)
(1 + r).
g(p1 , t)

Note that either θ̃1,1 > θ̃0.5,0.5 for all (1 + r) or θ̃1,1 < θ̃0.5,0.5 for all (1 + r), depending on
the form of g(·) chosen. Once one obtains a prediction as to the relationship between
θ̃1,1 and θ̃0.5,0.5 , it must hold for all gross interest rates. As such, one should never
observe the cross-over in behavior where for one gross interest rate ct allocations are
higher when (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and for another gross interest rate ct allocations are higher
when (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5). The cross-over that is observed in our data, therefore, is not
consistent with temporally dependent probability weighting of the form proposed by
Halevy (2008).
The aggregate violations of the DEU model documented above are also supported
in the individual data. Out of 14 opportunities to violate the DEU common ratio
prediction, individuals do so an average of 9.68 (s.d. = 5.50) times. Only fifteen percent
of subjects (12 of 80) commit zero violations of expected utility. For the 85 percent of

subjects who do violate expected utility, they do so in more than 80% of opportunities,
an average of 11.38 (s.d. = 3.99) times. Figure 3, Panel A presents a histogram of
counti , each individual’s number of DEU violations across conditions (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1)
and (0.5, 0.5). More than 40% of subjects violate common ratio predictions in all
14 opportunities. This may be a strict measure of violation as it requires identical
allocation across risk conditions. As a complementary measure, we also present a
histogram of |di |, the individual average budget share difference between risk conditions.
For each individual and each CTB, we calculate the budget share of the sooner payment,
(1 + r)ct /m. The average of each individual’s 14 budget share differences between
common-ratio conditions is the measure di . Here we consider the absolute value as the
difference may be positive in some cases and negative in others, following the aggregate
results.18 The mean value of |di | is 0.27 (s.d. = 0.18), indicating that individual DEU
violations are substantial, around 27% of the budget share. Indeed 63.8% of the sample
(51/80) exhibit |di | > 0.2, indicating that violations are not just the product of random
response error.

4.1.1

Estimating Risk-Dependent Preferences

The observed data in the cases of (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5) are inconsistent with the DEU model at both individual and aggregate levels and are difficult to
reconcile with notions of probability weighting. In this section we proceed with structural estimation of intertemporal preferences in hopes of more clearly understanding
the phenomenon. Given structural assumptions, the design allows us to estimate utility
parameters, following the methodology outlined in Andreoni and Sprenger (2009). We
18

That is, the absolute value of each of the 14 differences is obtained prior to computing the
average. When computing di across comparisons (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) vs. (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4) and
(p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5), the first budget share is subtracted from the second
budget share to have a directional difference. A disproportionate preference for certainty would be
exhibited by a positive di across (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) vs. (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4) and a negative di across
(p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5).

assume an exponentially discounted CRRA utility function,

U = p1 δ t (ct − ω)α + p2 δ t+k (ct+k − ω)α ,

where δ represents exponential discounting, α represents utility function curvature and
ω is a background parameter that could be interpreted as a Stone-Geary minima.19
We posit an exponential discounting function because for timing and transaction cost
reasons no present payments were provided. This precludes direct analysis of presentbiased or quasi-hyperbolic time preferences (Strotz, 1956; Phelps and Pollak, 1968;
Laibson, 1997; O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). Under this formulation, the DEU solution function, c∗t , can be written as

We estimate the parameters of this function via non-linear least squares with standard errors clustered on the individual level to obtain α̂, δ̂, and ω̂. An estimate of
the annual discount rate is generated as 1/δ̂ 365 − 1, with corresponding standard error
obtained via the delta method.
Table 2 presents discounting and curvature parameters estimated from the two
conditions (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5). In column (1), we estimate a
baseline model where discounting, curvature, and background parameters are restricted
19

The ω terms could be also be interpreted as intertemporal reference points or background consumption. Frequently in the time preference literature, the simplification ω = 0 is imposed or ω is
interpreted as minus background consumption (Andersen, Harrison, Lau and Rutstrom, 2008) and
calculated from an external data source. In Andreoni and Sprenger (2009) we provide methodology
for estimating the background parameters and employ this methodology here. Detailed discussions
of sensitivity and censored data issues are provided in Andreoni and Sprenger (2009) who show that
accounting for censoring issues has little influence on estimates.

to be around 27% per year and aggregate curvature is estimated to be 0.98. The

In column (2), we estimate separate discounting, curvature and background parameters for the two risk conditions. That is, we estimate a certain v(·) and an uncertain

20

u(·). Discounting is found to be similar across the conditions, around 30% per year
(F1,79 = 0.69, p = 0.41).20 In the certain condition, (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1), we find almost linear utility while in the uncertain condition, (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5), we estimate
utility to be significantly more concave (F1,79 = 24.09, p < 0.01). In the certain
condition, (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1), we estimate a background parameter ω̂1,1 of 2.28 while
in the uncertain condition the background parameter is significantly higher at 4.40
(F1,79 = 25.53, p < 0.01). A hypothesis test of equal utility parameter estimates across
conditions is rejected (F3,79 = 16.12, p < 0.01).
In Table 2, columns (3) through (6) we estimate utility parameters with various
imposed restrictions. In column (3), we restrict curvature to be equal across conditions
and obtain very similar discounting estimates, but a larger difference in estimated
background parameters. In column (4), we restrict discounting to be equal across
conditions and obtain a result almost identical to column (2). In column (5), we restrict
background parameters to be equal and obtain very similar discounting estimates, but a
larger difference in curvature. This finding is repeated in column (6) where discounting
is restricted to be the same. Across specifications, hypothesis tests of equality of utility
parameters are rejected. To illustrate how well these estimates fit the data, Figure 2
also displays solid lines with predicted behavior from the most restricted regression,
column (6). The general pattern of aggregate responses is well matched.21
Taken together, these results suggest substantial differences between certain and
uncertain utility parameters. The direction of the results is towards a larger back20

For comparison, using similar methodology without uncertainty Andreoni and Sprenger (2009)
find aggregate discount rate between 25-35% and aggregate curvature of around 0.92. These discount
rates are lower than generally found in the time preference literature (Frederick et al., 2002). Notable
exceptions of similarly low or lower discount rates include Coller and Williams (1999), Harrison, Lau
and Williams (2002), and Harrison et al. (2005) which all assume linear utility, and Andersen et al.
(2008), which accounts for utility function curvature with Holt and Laury (2002) risk measures.

(0.5, 0.5) condition relative to the certain (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1). Given that ω enters negatively into the utility function, these results point to a disproportionate preference for
certainty. For the payment values of the experiment, around $20, v(c) with certainty
will be greater than u(c) with uncertainty.

Behavior with Differential Risk

In this sub-section we explore disproportionate preferences for certainty in four conditions with differential risk. First, we discuss DEU violations in common ratio situations
where only one payment is certain as in the original Allais paradox. Second, we examine our three experimental conditions where all payments are uncertain and document
behavior consistent with discounted expected utility.

4.2.1

A Disproportionate Preference for Certainty

Figure 4 compares behavior in four conditions with differential risk but common ratios
of probabilities. Condition (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) (gray diamonds) is compared to (p1 , p2 ) =
(0.5, 0.4) (green triangles), and condition (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) (yellow circles) is compared
to (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5) (purple squares). The DEU model predicts equal allocations
across conditions with common ratios. Interestingly, subjects show a disproportionate
preference for certainty when it is available, regardless of whether the certain payment
is sooner or later. Hypotheses of equal allocations across conditions are rejected in
both cases.22
Figure 3, Panels B and C demonstrate that the individual behavior is organized in
a similar manner. Individual violations of common ratio predictions are substantial.
22

For equality across (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4) F14,79 = 7.69, p < .001 and for
equality across (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5) F14,79 = 5.46, p < .001. Test statistics
generated from non-parametric OLS regression of choice on indicators for interest rate (7 levels),
delay length (2 levels), risk condition (2 levels) and all interactions with clustered standard errors.
F-statistic corresponds to null hypothesis that all risk condition terms have zero slopes. See Appendix
Table A1 for regression.

Note: The figure presents aggregate behavior for N = 80 subjects under four conditions: (p1 , p2 ) =
(1, 0.8), (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4), (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5). Error bars represent 95%
confidence intervals, taken as +/ − 1.96 standard errors of the mean. The first and second conditions
share a common ratio as do the third and fourth. Test of H0 : Equality across conditions (p1 , p2 ) =
(1, 0.8) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4): F14,79 = 7.69, p < .001. Test of H0 : Equality across conditions
(p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5): F14,79 = 5.46, p < .001.

When certainty is sooner, across conditions (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4),
subjects commit an average of 10.90 (s.d. = 4.67) common ratio violations in 14 opportunities and only 7.5% of subjects commit zero violations. The average distance
in budget shares, di , is 0.150 (s.d. = 0.214), which is significantly greater than zero
(t79 = 6.24, p < 0.01), and in the direction of disproportionately preferring the certain sooner payment. When certainty is later across conditions (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) and
(p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5), subjects make an average of 9.68 (s.d. = 5.74) common ratio viola23

tions and 17.5% of subjects make no violations at all, similar to Panel A. The average
distance in budget share, di , is −0.161 (s.d. = 0.198), which is significantly less than
zero (t79 = 7.27, p < 0.01), and in the direction of disproportionately preferring the
certain later payment.
Importantly, violations of discounted expected utility correlate across experimental
comparisons. Figure 5 plots budget share differences, di , across common-ratio comparisons. The difference |di | from condition (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) vs. (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5) is
on the vertical axis while di across the alternate comparisons is on the horizontal axis.
Common ratio violations correlate highly across experimental conditions. The more an
individual violates DEU across conditions (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5) predicts how much he or she will demonstrate a disproportionate preference for certainty
when it is sooner in (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8) vs. (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4), (ρ = 0.31, p < 0.01),
and when it is later in (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) vs. (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5), (ρ = −0.47, p < 0.01).
Table 3 presents a correlation table for the number of violations counti , and the budget
proportion differences di , across comparisons and shows significant individual correlation across all conditions and across all measures for DEU violation behavior. This
individual data is strikingly supportive of the a u-v interpretation.

4.2.2

When All Choices Are Uncertain

Figure 6 presents aggregate behavior from three risky situtations: (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5)
(red diamonds); (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4) (green squares); and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5) (orange
triangles) over the experimentally varied values of θ and delay length. The mean earlier
choice of ct is graphed along with error bars corresponding to 95 percent confidence
intervals. We also plot predicted behavior based on uncertain utility function estimated
in Table 2, column (6). These out-of-sample predictions are plotted as solid lines in
green and orange. The solid red line corresponds to the model fit for (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5),
as in Figure 2.

Note: The figure presents the correlations of the budget share difference, di , across common ratio
comparisons. |di | across conditions (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 1) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5) is on the vertical axis.
di across the alternate comparisons is on the horizontal axis. Regression lines are provided. Corresponding correlation coefficients are ρ = 0.31, (p < 0.01) for the triangular points (p1 , p2 ) = (1, 0.8)
vs (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4) and ρ = −0.47, (p < 0.01) for the circular points (p1 , p2 ) = (0.8, 1) vs
(p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5). See Table 3 for more details.

We highlight two dimensions of Figure 6. First, the theoretical predictions are 1)
that ct should be declining in θ; and 2) that if two decisions have identical θ then ct
should be higher in the condition with the lower interest rate.23 These features are
observed in the data. Allocations of ct decline with θ and, where overlap of θ exists ct
23

Under the DEU-based solution function established in (4.1.1), ct should be monotonically decreasing in θ. Additionally, if θ = θ0 and 1 + r 6= 1 + r0 then behavior should be identical up to a scaling
factor related to the interest rates 1 + r and 1 + r0 . ct should be slightly higher in the lower interest
rate condition due to income effects.

ratio conditions. Level of significance: *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01.

is generally higher for lower gross interest rates.24 Second, out of sample predictions
match actual aggregate behavior. Indeed, the out-of-sample calculated R2 values are
high: 0.878 for (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4) and 0.580 for (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5).25
The results are surprisingly consistent with the DEU model. Indeed, when the data
from the (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.4), (p1 , p2 ) = (0.5, 0.5) and (p1 , p2 ) = (0.4, 0.5) conditions
24

This pattern of allocations is obtained for all sessions and for all orders indicating no presence of
order or day effects.
25
By comparison, making similar out of sample predictions using utility estimates from (p1 , p2 ) =
(1, 1) yields predictions that diverge dramatically from actual behavior (see Appendix Figure A1) and
lowers R2 values to 0.767 and 0.462, respectively. This suggests that accounting for differential utility
function curvature in risky situations allows for an improvement of fit on the order of 15-25%.

are used to estimate the uncertain utility function, the results are in line with those of
Table 2, column (6). Discounting and ω̂ are virtually unchanged and the uncertain α
parameter is estimated to be 0.834 (s.e. = 0.020).
Figure 6 demonstrates that in situations where all payments are risky, utility parameters measured under uncertainty describe behavior extremely well. Though subjects
have a disproportionate preference for certainty when it is available, they trade off
relative risk and interest rates like expected utility maximizers away from certainty.

Discussion and Conclusion

Intertemporal decision-making involves a combination of certainty and uncertainty.
In an experiment using Convex Time Budgets (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2009) under
varying risk conditions, we document violations of discounted expected utility. Our
findings indicate that certain and uncertain consumption are evaluated very differently.
Subjects exhibit a disproportionate preference for certainty when it is available, but
behave approximately as discounted expected utility maximizers away from certainty.
We interpret our findings as being consistent with both prior research on expected
utility violations and the intuition of the Allais Paradox (Allais, 1953). Allais (1953, p.
530) argued that when two options are far from certain, individuals act effectively as
discounted expected utility maximizers, while when one option is certain and another
is uncertain a disproportionate preference for certainty prevails.
Demonstrating a difference between certain and uncertain utility has substantial
implications for intertemporal decision theory. In particular, we consider present bias.
Present bias has been frequently documented (Frederick et al., 2002) and is argued
to be a dynamically inconsistent discounting phenomenon generated by diminishing
impatience through time. Our results suggest that present-bias may have an alternate
source. If individuals exhibit a disproportionate preference for certainty when it is
available, then present, certain consumption will be disproportionately favored over
future, uncertain consumption. When only uncertain future consumption is considered,
individuals act as expected utility maximizers and apparent preference reversals are
generated.
Other research has discussed the possibility that certainty plays a role in the generating present bias (Halevy, 2008). Additionally such a notion is implicit in the recognized dynamic inconsistency of non-expected utility models (Green, 1987; Machina,
1989) and could be thought of as preferring immediate resolution of uncertainty (Kreps
and Porteus, 1978; Chew and Epstein, 1989; Epstein and Zin, 1989). Our results point
28

in a new direction: that certainty, per se, is disproportionately preferred. This view is
captured in the u-v preference models of Neilson (1992), Schmidt (1998), and Diecidue
et al. (2004) and may help researchers to understand how and why present bias and
other discounting phenomena are manifested.

Welcome Text

Welcome and thank you for participating.
Eligibility for this study: To be in this study, you need to meet these criteria. You
must have a campus mailing address of the form:

YOUR NAME
9450 GILMAN DR 92(MAILBOX NUMBER)
LA JOLLA CA 92092-(MAILBOX NUMBER)

Your mailbox must be a valid way for you to receive mail from now through the
end of the Spring Quarter.
You must be willing to provide your name, campus mail box, email address, and
student PID. This information will only be seen by Professor Andreoni and his assistants. After payment has been sent, this information will be destroyed. Your identity
will not be a part of any subsequent data analysis.
You must be willing to receive your payment for this study by check, written to
you by Professor James Andreoni, Director of the UCSD Economics Laboratory. The
checks will be drawn on the USE Credit Union on campus. You may deposit or cash
your check wherever you like. If you wish, you can cash your checks for free at the USE
Credit Union any weekday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm with valid identification (drivers
license, passport, etc.).
The checks will be delivered to you at your campus mailbox at a date to be determined by your decisions in this study, and by chance. The latest you could receive
payment is the last week of classes in the Spring Quarter.
If you do not meet all of these criteria, please inform us of this now.

Instruction and Examples Script

Earning Money:
To begin, you will be given a $10 minimum payment. You will receive this payment
in two payments of $5 each. The two $5 minimum payments will come to you at two
different times. These times will be determined in the way described below. Whatever
you earn from the study today will be added to these minimum payments.
In this study, you will make 84 choices over how to allocate money between two
points in time, one time is ‘earlier’ and one is ‘later’. Both the earlier and later times
will vary across decisions. This means you could be receiving payments as early as
one week from today, and as late as the last week of classes in the Spring Quarter, or
possibly other dates in between.
It is important to note that the payments in this study involve chance. There is a
chance that your earlier payment, your later payment or both will not be sent at all.
For each decision, you will be fully informed of the chance involved for the sooner and
later payments. Whether or not your payments will be sent will be determined at the
END of the experiment today. If, by chance, one of your payments is not sent, you will
receive only the $5 minimum payment.
Once all 84 decisions have been made, we will randomly select one of the 84
decisions as the decision-that-counts. This will be done in three stages. First, we will
pick a number from 1 to 84 at random to determine which is the decision-that-counts
and the corresponding sooner and later payment dates. Then we will pick a second
number at random from 1 to 10 to determine if the sooner payment will be sent. Then
we will pick a third number at random from 1 to 10 to determine if the later payment
will be sent. We will use the decision-that-counts to determine your actual earnings.
Note, since all decisions are equally likely to be chosen, you should make each decision
as if it will be the decision-that-counts. When calculating your earnings from the
decision-that-counts, we will add to your earnings the two $5 minimum payments.

37

Thus, you will always get paid at least $5 at the chosen earlier time, and at least $5
at the chosen later time.

IMPORTANT: All payments you receive will arrive to your campus mailbox. On
the scheduled day of payment, a check will be placed for delivery in campus mail
services by Professor Andreoni and his assistants. Campus mail services guarantees
delivery of 100% of your payments by the following day.
As a reminder to you, the day before you are scheduled to receive one of your
payments, we will send you an e-mail notifying you that the payment is coming. On
your table is a business card for Professor Andreoni with his contact information.
Please keep this in a safe place. If one of your payments is not received you should
immediately contact Professor Andreoni, and we will hand-deliver payment to you.

Your Identity:
In order to receive payment, we will need to collect the following pieces of information from you: name, campus mail box, email address, and student PID. This
information will only be seen by Professor Andreoni and his assistants. After all payments have been sent, this information will be destroyed. Your identity will not be a
part of subsequent data analysis.
On your desk are two envelopes: one for the sooner payment and one for the later
payment. Please take the time now to address them to yourself at your campus mail
box.

How it Works:
In each decision you are asked to divide 100 tokens between two payments at two
different dates: Payment A (which is sooner) and Payment B (which is later). Tokens
will be exchanged for money. The tokens you allocate to Payment B (later) will always

38

be worth at least as much as the tokens you allocate to Payment A (sooner). The
process is best described by an example. Please examine the sample sheet in you
packet marked SAMPLE.
The sample sheet provided is similar to the type of decision sheet you will fill out in
the study. The sample sheet shows the choice to allocate 100 tokens between Payment
A on April 17th and Payment B on May 1st. Note that today’s date is highlighted in
yellow on the calendar on the left hand side. The earlier date (April 17th) is marked
in green and the later date (May 1st) is marked in blue. The earlier and later dates
will always be marked green and blue in each decision you make. The dates are also
indicated in the table on the right.
In this decision, each token you allocate to April 17th is worth $0.10, while each
token you allocate to May 1st is worth $0.15. So, if you allocate all 100 tokens to
April 17th, you would earn 100x$0.10 = $10 (+ $5 minimum payment) on this date
and nothing on May 1st (+ $5 minimum payment). If you allocate all 100 tokens to
May 1st, you would earn 100x$0.15 = $15 (+ $5 minimum payment) on this date and
nothing on April 17th (+ $5 minimum payment). You may also choose to allocate
some tokens to the earlier date and some to the later date. For instance, if you allocate
62 tokens to April 17th and 38 tokens to May 1st, then on April 17th you would earn
62x$0.10 = $6.20 (+ $5 minimum payment) and on May 1st you would earn 38x$0.15
= $5.70 (+ $5 minimum payment). In your packet is a Payoff Table showing some of
the token-dollar exchange at all relevant token exchange rates.
REMINDER: Please make sure that the total tokens you allocate between Payment
A and Payment B sum to exactly 100 tokens. Feel free to use the calculator provided
in making your allocations and making sure your total tokens add to exactly 100 in
each row.

Chance of Receiving Payments:

39

Each decision sheet also lists the chances that each payment is sent. In this example
there is a 70% chance that Payment A will actually be sent and a 30% chance that
Payment B will actually be sent. In each decision we will inform you of the chance that
the payments will be sent. If this decision were chosen as the decision-that-counts we
would determine the actual payments by throwing two ten sided die, one for Payment
A and one for Payment B.
EXAMPLE: Let’s consider the person who chose to allocate 62 tokens to April
17th and 38 tokens to May 1st. If this were the decision-that-counts we would then
throw a ten-sided die for Payment A. If the die landed on 1,2,3,4,5,6,or 7, the person’s
Payment A would be sent and she would receive $6.20 (+ $5 minimum payment) on
April 17th. If the die landed 8,9, or 10, the payment would not be sent and she would
receive only the $5 minimum payment on April 17th. Then we would throw a second
ten-sided die for Payment B. If the die landed 1,2, or 3, the person’s Payment B would
be sent and she would receive $5.70 (+ $5 minimum payment) on May 1st. If the die
landed 4,5,6,7,8,9, or 10, the payment would not be sent and she would receive only
the $5 minimum payment on May 1st.

Things to Remember:
• You will always be allocating exactly 100 tokens.
• Tokens you allocate to Payment A (sooner) and Payment B (later) will be exchanged for money at different rates. The tokens you allocate to Payment B will
always be worth at least as much as those you allocate to Payment A.
• Payment A and Payment B will have varying degrees of chance. You will be fully
informed of the chances.
• On each decision sheet you will be asked 7 questions. For each decision you will
allocate 100 tokens. Allocate exactly 100 tokens for each decision row, no more,
40

no less.
• At the end of the study a random number will be drawn to determine which
is the decision-that-counts. Because each question is equally likely, you should
treat each decision as if it were the one that determines your payments. Two
more random numbers will be drawn by throwing two ten sided die to determine
whether or not the payments you chose will actually be sent.
• You will get an e-mail reminder the day before your payment is scheduled to
arrive.
• Your payment, by check, will be sent by campus mail to the mailbox number you
provide.
• Campus mail guarantees 100% on-time delivery.
• You have received the business card for Professor James Andreoni. Keep this card
in a safe place and contact Prof. Andreoni immediately if one of your payments
is not received.
