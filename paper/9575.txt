ABSTRACT
Using the firm-level data set, the paper attempts to examine the dynamic patterns in the allocation
of credit across firms in recent Korea. In particular, the paper examines the dynamic patterns in the
allocation of credit across large and small firms before and after the crisis. The data suggest that large
firms, to some extent, are leaving banks and going to the capital market for their financing after the
crisis. The data also suggest that profitable small firms are gaining easier access to the credit from
financial institutions after the crisis. Is this shift (in the allocation of bank credit from large firms to
small firms) due to lenders’ choice or due to borrowers’ changed incentives? The paper suggests that
the improved lending practices of banks, at least partially, contributed to this shift of bank credit from
large firms to small firms.

Sources of Corporate Financing and Economic Crisis in
Korea:
A Micro-evidence

1. Introduction

Using the firm-level data set1, this paper attempts to examine the dynamic patterns in the
allocation of credit across firms in recent Korea. Supposedly, in Korea, the economic crisis in
1997 had a significant impact on the pattern in the allocation of credit across firms. In particular,
this paper aims to examine the dynamic patterns in the allocation of credit across large and small
firms after the crisis.
Corporate financing issues are intimately related to the cause of the Korean crisis.

For

instance, the chaebols’ indebtedness to banks is viewed as having contributed much to the crisis.
Among others, Krueger and Yoo (2001) demonstrate that the chaebols’ indebtedness is indeed the
chief culprit of the crisis. Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 1997, the government has
undertaken various reform measures to restructure the financial and corporate sectors. The new
regulatory system is now underway to induce the financial institutions to change their imprudent
lending practices, and the capital market began to force the chaebols to correct their incentive
structure. Supposedly, these post-crisis developments in Korea have caused the chaebols and

1

financial institutions to change their previously imprudent (borrowing and lending) practices.
The paper suggests that large firms, to some extent, are leaving banks and going to the capital
market for their financing after the crisis. The paper also suggests that profitable small firms are
gaining easier access to credit by financial institutions after the crisis. There has been a shift in
the allocation of bank credit from large firms to small firms. Is this shift due to lenders’ choice or
due to borrowers’ changed incentives? The paper suggests that the improved lending practices of
banks, at least partially, contributed to this shift of bank credit from large firms to small firms.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide the aggregate data on the
corporate financing sources in recent Korea. Section 3 explains the firm-level data set. In
Section 4, we examine the dynamic patterns in the allocation of credit across firms. Section 5
concludes the paper with agenda for future research.

2. Aggregate Patterns in the Corporate Financing Sources

In <table 1> we show the aggregate data for the sources of corporate financing before and after
the economic crisis. We calculated the numbers in <table 1> from the information given in
various issues of the Flows of Funds by the Bank of Korea.
//Table 1 here//
The main reason we present this table is that it decomposes indirect finance further into the
detailed sources (commercial banks, insurance companies (including pension funds), short-term
finance companies (e.g., merchant banks), and other non-bank financial intermediaries). Another
point in the table is that it has been constructed by aggregating all the financial transactions for all
1

The data set covers most of the Korean firms except for extra-small ones.

2

the firms in the Korean economy. Hence, we could use this table for the check of the consistency
in the firm-level data, for example, whether there is any systematic bias in the firm-level data due
to the exclusion of extra-small firms.
After the crisis, in 1998-9, the share of external finance in the total finance sharply declines to
50% from about 70% throughout the 90’s until 19972.
In 1998, as expected, the crisis changes completely the table for corporate financing sources.
However, in 2000 when the crisis phases out, the table for corporate financing sources takes a
somewhat different composition compared to before the crisis.
First of all, the share of indirect finance does not recover the level before the crisis. A look
into the components of indirect finance is necessary.

The non-bank financial intermediaries,

except for insurance companies, lose their share significantly compared with before the crisis.
On the other hand, the share of commercial banks increases to almost double the average level
before the crisis.

Second, in 2000, the composition of direct finance changes compared to

before the crisis.

Equity takes away the share of the borrowing from financial markets

(commercial paper, bonds, etc).

Lastly, foreign borrowing increases its share significantly.

3. The Firm-level Data

This study uses detailed financial information on the firms that have external audit reports.
According to the Act on External Audit of Joint-Stock Corporations, a firm with assets of 7 billion
2

Although not shown in the table, the share of external finance in the total finance declined steadily throughout the
1970’s and 1980’s until 1988. For this period, except for the period of oil shocks, overseas export markets,
together with emerging domestic markets, helped Korean firms to realize large profits. The ratio of internal
finance to total finance was less than 20 percent in 1975, but it continued to grow to a level of more than 40 percent
in 1988.

3

won or more must issue audited financial statements. The data thus include all the firms with
assets of 7 billion won or more. The total number of firms in the data is about 11,000.
The Financial Supervisory Commission is responsible for establishing accounting and auditing
standards and the Securities and Futures Commission is then responsible for the review of the
audited financial statements issued by firms.

Finally, the National Information and Credit

Evaluation, Inc. (NICE) coded this public information into their database after checking the
consistency of the reported financial statements.
From the NICE data, we can estimate only the borrowing from all the financial intermediaries,
not the borrowings from the detailed components of indirect finance. However, <table 1> in
Section 2 shows that, after the crisis, most of the new lending by financial intermediaries is, in fact,
from commercial banks, not from non-bank financial institutions.

3.1 Summary Statistics

<Table 2-1> presents sample means for the key variables in the empirical analysis It divides the
sample period into the three sub-period around the crisis: 1992-1996 (before the crisis), 1997-1998
(during the crisis), and 1999-2000 (after the crisis). Profitability is measured by the EBIT
(Earnings Before Interest and Tax Payment) divided by total assets. divided by total asset. After
the crisis, the share of loans in asset increases compared with for the pre-crisis period; on the other
hand, the weight of bond financing decreases.
//Table 2-1 here//
The financing pattern varies according to the size of firms. For example, the empirical
distribution of the loans’ share in total asset has a different shape according to the size of firms. For

4

this reason, we divide all individual firms into ten groups based on the distribution of asset size,
and select three representative size cohorts for presenting the empirical results. The results are
robust to minor changes in the thresholds. We employ the following three size cohorts: (1) the
largest firms (top 1% in asset size)3, (2) the medium-sized firms (middle 10% in asset size), and (3)
the smallest firms (bottom 10% in asset size).
For the three size cohorts, <table 2-2> provides sample means for the key variables in the
empirical analysis It also divides the sample period into the three sub-period around the crisis.
//Table 2-2 here//
The statistics in <table 2-2> present a different picture compared to the one in <table 2-1>. The
aggregate numbers in <table 2-1> do not fully capture the changes in the financing pattern
experienced by heterogeneous firms during this period. Profitability evolves differently according
to size groups. Profitability worsens for large and small firms whereas it rebounds for mediumsized firms. While the share of loans in asset decreases for large firms, the opposite is the case for
the other groups. After the crisis, large firms finance more in the bond market, but the other groups
have more limited access to the bond market compared to the pre-crisis period.

3.2 Firm Size Distribution

<Figure 1-1> and <figure 1-2> show the yearly firm-size distributions for all the firms in the
sample before and after the crisis. Before the crisis, the distribution shifts to the right-hand side –
implying an increase in firm size on average. The shape of the distribution gets skewed to the
right gradually over time until 1997. We find relatively less small-sized firms over time in the
3

For the case of large firms, we present the results using this particular cohort, but defining the largest firms as
differently like the top 5%, or top 10%, does not change the qualitative results of the paper.

5

yearly distributions.
//Figure 1-1 here//
//Figure 1-2 here//
After the crisis, it is hard to find a clear pattern in the shift of the distribution itself. However,
the left-hand tail of the distribution - the smallest firms in the sample – becomes thicker after the
crisis. The relative frequency of the smallest firms in the sample increases after the crisis. This
thicker right tail could come either from an increased number of new entrants or from the inclusion
of extra-small firms (previously excluded from the sample) into the sample. Note that we observe
the opposite before the crisis - the left-hand tail of the distribution getting thinner.

3.3 Firm Profitability Distribution

<Figure 2-1> and <figure 2-2> present the yearly profitability distributions for all the firms in
the sample before and after the crisis. The yearly distributions remain the same before the crisis.
Then the crisis affects significantly the profitability distribution in 1997, indicating a decrease in
firm profitability on average. After the crisis, the profitability distribution shifts much to the right
or left depending on the macroeconomic situations. In fact, after the crisis, the magnitude of
business cycle became larger than compared to the pre-crisis period.4
//Figure 2-1 here//
//Figure 2-2 here//
<Figure 2-3> shows that the small- and medium-sized firms have more dispersed distributions

4

The annual growth rates of GDP after the crisis are 5.0% (1997), –6.7% (1998), 10.9% (1999), and 8.8% (2000),
whereas, before the crisis, the difference between the peak and trough years dos not exceed 4%.

6

in 1992-2000. Since this pattern remains the same in the sample period, we do not present the
yearly distributions here. Large firms are more homogeneous in terms of profitability compared
to the other size cohorts.
//Figure 2-3 here//
<Figure 2-4-1> and <figure 2-4-2> show that the crisis had an impact on the shape of the
profitability for small firms. After the crisis (1997-2000), the distribution gets more dispersed
over time. After the crisis small firms become a more heterogeneous group compared to the precrisis period.
//Figure 2-4-1 here//
//Figure 2-4-2 here//

4. Financing Pattern and the Crisis: Micro Evidence

In Section 3.1, the summary statistics of key financing variables hint that the heterogeneity
of firms is important in understanding the evolution of financing pattern after the crisis. The
sample means of key financing variables also hint the following pattern around the crisis: the
largest firms are leaving financial intermediaries and switching directly to the financial markets for
their financing, whereas the small- and medium-sized firms are increasing their dependency on
financial intermediaries for financing. In this section, we test these hypotheses rigorously. To
get genuine cross-sectional results, we must control for the effect of the business cycles.
The empirical distributions of key financing variables have different shapes according to
the size of firms and evolve differently after the crisis. In this section, therefore, we also present the

7

result of comparing the empirical distributions of key financing variables.

4.1 Loans from Financial Institutions

<Table 3> shows the regressions of the loan-borrowing ratio (defined as the borrowing from
financial intermediaries divided by total borrowing) on the dummy variables denoting the size
cohort interacted with year dummies and on the macro variables (growth rate of GDP, interest rate).
The macro variables control for the effect of business cycles. In <table 3>, therefore, the reported
coefficient for the specific year indicates the loan-borrowing ratio’s difference between the size
cohort in that specific year and all the other firms in the whole sample period. <Table 3> shows
the regression results for the three size cohorts (top 1%, middle 10%, bottom 10%).
//Table 3 here//
After the crisis (in 1998-2000), the largest firms decrease significantly the share of loans in
total borrowing. The coefficients for 1998-2000 are larger than 0.3 (all significant), whereas the
coefficients for 1992-1997 are smaller than 0.2 (also all significant). That is, after the crisis, the
largest firms are leaving financial intermediaries for their financing.
For the small-sized firms this share jumps to a higher number from 1995 and stays more or less
there even after the crisis. The coefficients for 1992-4 are smaller than -0.2 (all significant),
whereas the coefficients for 1996-2000 are larger than zero (in 1995, -.0.03); these coefficients are
all significant except in 2000.

The small firms did not have much access to financial

intermediaries in 1992-4, but they have better access to the loans from financial intermediaries
afterwards.
For the medium-sized firms, the share of loans in total borrowing does not show any marked

8

trend around the crisis. Note that the summary statistics in Section 3.1 suggested a different
interpretation as for the behavior of medium-sized firms.
< Empirical Distribution of Loans for Different Cohorts>
<Figure 3-1-1> and <figure 3-1-2> show the distribution of the loan-borrowing ratio for the
largest cohort (top 1% firms in asset size) before and after the crisis. After the crisis (in 19982000), the loan-borrowing ratio distribution for the largest firms shifts leftwards clearly, as seen in
<figure 3-1-2>. This leftward shift starts partly in 1997 during the crisis.
//Figure 3-1-1 here//
//Figure 3-1-2 here//
For the small-sized firms (bottom 10% firms in asset size) the distribution the loan-borrowing
ratio shifts to the right markedly in 1996 (actually in 1995, although not shown in the paper) and
maintains more or less this pattern even after the crisis (<figure 3-2-1> and <figure 3-2-2>).
//Figure 3-2-1 here//
//Figure 3-2-2 here//
In <figure 3-2-1>, we note that, until 1994, a certain portion of the firms in our database does
not have access to financial intermediaries for their corporate financing. One could see a certain
dense around zero. However, after 1994, this pattern changes: the dense around zero continue to
disappear until 1997, and, after the crisis, a dense around zero appears again, but to a much smaller
scale than before 1995. <Figure 3-2-1> and <figure 3-2-2> make another interesting point.
After 1994, we continue to see a peak at one and a certain mass around one, which indicates that
these firms depend (or do not depend) completely on the loans from financial intermediaries for
their borrowing.
9

For the medium-sized firms, the share of loans in total borrowing does not show any marked
changes before and after the crisis, except that, after the crisis, we could see a more cluster around
one (<figure 3-3-1> and <figure 3-3-2>).
//Figure 3-3-1 here//
//Figure 3-3-2 here//

4.2 Determinants of the Changes in the Allocation of Loans

Why do we observe such shifts in allocation of loans by financial institutions as documented in
Section 4.1? Are they reflecting the firms’ spontaneous choice for financing sources as a result of
corporate restructuring? Or, did the financial reform cause financial institutions to shift their
lending patterns? To see whether this is the case, we attempt to test the effect of individual firm
profitability on the shift in allocation of loans by financial institutions.
<Table 4> shows the regressions of the change in loans on firm profitability (interacted with
year dummy) for small firms. We also test the effect of the affiliation with chaebols on the access
to loans. The chaebol dummy distinguishes the top 30 chaebols from the others.
//Table 4 here//
<Table 4> suggests the interpretation that, for the small firms, profitability is an important
factor in determining access to loans by financial institutions after the crisis.5 Financial institutions
actively search for profitable small firms to provide loans after the crisis. In Section 3.4, we
pointed out that that the crisis had an impact on the shape of the profitability for small firms. The
profitability distribution becomes more dispersed after the crisis. It means that selecting efficient
5

For medium-sized and large firms, the regression of the change in loans on firm profitability did not produce

10

small firms became more difficult after the crisis.
Before the crisis, profitability was not a factor in the access of small firms to loans; on the
contrary, inefficient small firms did have more access to loans by financial institutions. This
reflects the fact that small firms were much protected through various regulations by the
government before the crisis. Note that the affiliation with chaebols has a negative effect on the
access to loans. In Korea, small firms affiliated with chaebols usually do not get the protection
but rather face tight regulations to the effect of protecting other independent small firms. This
kind of regulations is gradually shrinking after the crisis.

4.3 Total Borrowing

In Section 4.1, it is suggested that the largest firms are leaving financial intermediaries for their
corporate financing after the crisis.

Then, the question arises: do the large firms decrease

investment and scale down their business? Otherwise, do they find other sources of financing
after the crisis? To check this, we look at total borrowing before and after the crisis.
<Table 5> shows the regressions of the borrowing-dependency ratio (defined as total borrowing
divided by total assets) on the dummy variables denoting the size cohort interacted with year
dummies and on the macro variables (growth rate of GDP, interest rate). In <table 7>, the
reported coefficient for the specific year indicates the borrowing-dependency differences between
the size cohort in that specific year and all the other firms in the whole sample period. <Table 5>
shows the regression results for the three size cohorts (top 1%, middle 10%, bottom 10%).
//Table 5 here//

meaningful results.

11

The crisis affected the borrowing-dependency ratio of all the cohorts only during the crisis.
When the crisis dies out, the borrowing-asset ratio returns to the previous trend. The share of
borrowing in total assets went up much more for the small-sized firms during the crisis than the
other size cohorts. Unlike the others, small firms didn’t have other cushions (e.g., equity, retained
earnings) to absorb the adverse effect of the crisis.

4.4 Financing in the Bond Market

The above result implies that the large firms moves to some other sources of financing after the
crisis. This section will show that the large firms go to the bond market to compensate the
decrease in loans by financial institutions. This was hinted in Section 2.1. We test it formally in
the following.
<Table 6> shows the regressions of the bond-borrowing ratio (defined as the borrowing from
financial markets divided by total borrowing) on the dummy variables denoting the size cohort
interacted with year dummies and on the macro variables (growth rate of GDP, interest rate). In
<table 6>, the reported coefficient for the specific year indicates the bond-borrowing ratio’s
differences between the size cohort in that specific year and all the other firms in the whole sample
period. <Table 6> shows the regression results for the three size cohorts (top 1%, top 6% - top
10%, top 11% - top 20%). The reason for choosing a different set of cohorts for <table 4> is that,
for the sample period, the small- and medium-sized firms (the cohorts we used in the regression
analysis before) don’t have any access to the borrowing from financial markets.
//Table 6 here//
After the crisis (in 1998-2000), the largest firms increase markedly the share of bond financing

12

in total borrowing. The coefficients for 1998-2000 are around 0.4 (all significant), whereas the
coefficients for 1992-1997 are smaller than 0.3 (also all significant).
For all the size cohorts, the share of bond financing in total asset increases gradually from 1992
to 1996. This is due to the financial liberalization policy gradually taken by the government since
the early 1990s. During this period the size of bond market in Korea gradually expanded. The
bond market gets developed more rapidly with the speed-up of financial liberalization policy after
the crisis.
< Empirical Distribution of Bond Financing for Different Cohorts >
<Figure 4-1-1> and <Figure 4-1-2> show the bond-borrowing ratio distributions before and
after the crisis for the largest cohort. After the crisis (in 1998-2000), the bond-borrowing ratio
distribution for the largest firms shifts clearly to the right (<figure 4-1-2>).
//Figure 4-1-1 here//
//Figure 4-1-2 here//
In <figure 4-2-1> and <figure 4-2-2>, we show the similar figures for another size cohort (top
11% - top 20% firms in asset size). This cohort is, in fact, the smallest firms to have any access to
the bond market at all in the sample period. For this cohort, the loan-borrowing ratio distribution
shifts to the right marginally before the crisis. After the crisis, however, the distribution shifts
back to the left.

There is a large peak around zero in 1999.and the distribution becomes

degenerate in 2000 (i.e., this cohort does not have any access to bond market). A large proportion
of the bonds that has been issued during the crisis, were under the risk of default, especially after
the demise of the Daewoo group (one of the top four chaebols at that time in Korea) in 1999.
This, in turn, put the whole market for corporate bonds into a state of malfunction in 1999 and in

13

2000.
//Figure 4-2-1 here//
//Figure 4-2-2 here//

5. Concluding Remarks

The paper documents that large firms, to some extent, are leaving banks and going to the
capital market for their financing after the crisis.

6

The paper also shows that profitable small

firms are gaining easier access to credit by financial institutions after the crisis.

Financial

institutions are reallocating their credit from large firms to small firms after the crisis. Why do we
observe such shifts in the allocation of loans by financial institutions? Are they reflecting the
firms’ spontaneous choice for financing sources as a result of corporate restructuring? Otherwise,
did the financial reform cause financial institutions to change their lending practices? The paper
suggests that the banks’ improved lending practices, at least partially, contributed to this shift.

6

Clearly, the liberalization of financial markets, which happened at an accelerating rate after the crisis, contributed
to broaden the supply base of various corporate financing sources. But, in Korea, deepening furthermore the
supply base of various corporate financing sources still requires a better protection of investors’ legitimate rights for
various corporate financing tools.
