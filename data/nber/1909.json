A part of economic growth is the channeling of saving into the most productive real investments. The ability of various tax regimes to channel saving efficiently and independently of the inflation rate is the focus of the current paper. The tax regimes include current law, preERTA law, the Treasury and Administration reform proposals, HR 3838, and what seems likely to come out of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n",
