Negative Interest Rate Policy and the Yield Curve
Jing Cynthia Wu and Fan Dora Xia
NBER Working Paper No. 25180
October 2018
JEL No. E43,E52
ABSTRACT
We evaluate the implications of the ECB's negative interest rate policy (NIRP) on the yield curve.
To capture various shapes of the short end of the yield curve induced by the NIRP, we introduce
two policy indicators, which summarize the immediate and longer-horizon future monetary
policy stances. We find the four NIRP events lowered the short term interest rate by the same
amount. The impact is dampened at longer maturities for the first two event dates due to lack of
forward guidance. In contrast, in the last two dates, forward guidance drives the largest effects in
two years.

Introduction

The effective lower bound (ELB) of nominal interest rates is one of the most discussed
economic issues of the past decade. The negative interest rate policy (NIRP) is among the
latest additions to unconventional monetary policy toolkits, in the hopes of providing further
stimulus to the economies that face the ELB. For example, in June 2017, the deposit rate of
the Swiss National Bank was at a record low of -0.75%, while the European Central Bank’s
(ECB) deposit facility rate was -0.4%. The total volume of outstanding bonds with negative
interest rates reached its peak at 15 trillion dollars in 2016.
As an emerging policy tool, it is important for policy makers and economists to understand its implications. The first question is what is the NIRP’s impact on the yield curve?
Second, what are economic agents’ perceptions of this policy and how do they form expectations? Third, because the zero lower bound (ZLB) is no longer binding, the NIRP creates
richer shapes for the short end of the yield curve. How do we accommodate them when we
model the term structure of interest rates? Understanding these questions is important to
European countries and Japan, which are currently implementing the NIRP. Such an understanding is also potentially important for the US economy, for which the NIRP remains a
future option if large negative shocks hit the economy.
We propose a new shadow rate term structure model (SRTSM) to address these questions,
and we focus on the Euro area. At the ELB, the short end of the yield curve displays three
different shapes. The first case is flat, similar to what we see in the US data when the ZLB
prevails but without the NIRP. Second, the yield curve could be downward sloping when
agents expect future cuts of the policy rate due to the NIRP. Third, on some days, it is
initially flat in the very short end and then downward sloping, implying market participants
expect no immediate action from the central bank, but they think the overall future monetary
policy is expansionary. To capture these shapes, we introduce two policy indicators: one for
the immediate monetary policy stance, and the other for the future monetary policy stance
at longer horizons. We model the discrete movement of the ECB’s deposit facility rate at
2

the ELB with a simple and intuitive regime-switching model conditioning on the two policy
indicators. Our model is able to capture the three different shapes at the short end of the
yield curve that we see in the data. We then build the dynamics of the deposit rate into
an SRTSM using the Black (1995) framework, where the short term interest rate is the
maximum of the non-positive deposit rate and a shadow interest rate.
We use our model to extract the market’s expectations on the NIRP. Overall, expectations of financial market participants from our model agree with economists’ expectations
from the Bloomberg survey. Importantly, our model has the advantage over the Bloomberg
survey because we can extract the market’s expectations further into the future, whereas the
Bloomberg surveys are collected only one week before monetary policy meetings. We find
the June 2014 and December 2015 cuts were expected the month before, and the September
2014 cut was entirely unanticipated. Most interestingly, the March 2016 cut was expected 4
months before the actual cut.
We then evaluate the NIRP’s policy implications on the yield curve. For the four event
dates, the ECB lowered the deposit rate by 10 basis points, which lowered the short end of
the yield curve by the same amount. While the impact is dampened at longer maturities for
the first two dates, the NIRP caused a humped shape change of the yield curve for the last
two. We further decompose the NIRP into the rate cut itself and forward guidance. We find
for the first two dates, the NIRP worked through the rate cut itself. For the later two dates,
forward guidance became a significant part of the story, and it was the reason that drives
the humped shape.
We assess the risk premium associated with the NIRP. We first measure it as the difference between the risk-neutral and real world conditional expectations. We find most of
the time, the risk premium of the NIRP is positive or close to zero, which means agents
typically associate a rate cut with an expansionary monetary policy. One exception is four
months before the March 2016 cut, when the difference between the risk-neutral and physical
expectations was almost -10 basis points. Our interpretation is that agents took a cut in

3

March 2016 as a sign of weak economic outlook. Relatedly, the NIRP drives a small but
positive term premium on the 10-year yield.
We compare our model to several alternatives including several SRTSMs proposed in the
literature and the Gaussian affine term structure model (GATSM). We find our new model
performs the best in terms of higher likelihood and lower pricing errors. The existing models
in the literature, on the other hand, do poorly.
After a brief literature review, the rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 models
the dynamics of the deposit rate, and Section 3 sets up the new SRTSM. Section 4 discusses
data, estimation, and estimates. Section 5 examines markets’ information on the NIRP,
while Section 6 assesses the NIRP’s impact on the yield curve. Section 7 compares our
model to alternatives, and Section 8 concludes.

Literature Earlier work has applied the SRTSM mostly to the Japanese and US yield
curve. For example, Kim and Singleton (2012) and Ichiue and Ueno (2013) focus on Japan,
whereas Krippner (2013), Christensen and Rudebusch (2014), Wu and Xia (2016), and Bauer
and Rudebusch (2016) focus on the United States. These papers kept the lower bound at a
constant level.
A few studies have worked on the new development in Europe, where the policy lower
bound kept moving down to negative numbers after the NIRP. For example, Lemke and
Vladu (2016) and Kortela (2016). However, none of these papers allow agents to be forwardlooking in terms of the future movement of the policy rate, which is an important feature of
our model. And this feature allows our model to fit the short end of the yield curve much
better than the ones in the literature.
Our paper relates to the regime-switching literature, with the seminal paper by Hamilton
(1989). Applications of this class of model in the term structure literature include Ang and
Bekaert (2002), Bansal and Zhou (2002), and Dai et al. (2007). These papers allow the
parameters of the dynamics to take several different values. In contrast, these parameters

are constant in our model, and the deposit rate follows a regime switching process. Several
papers are similar to ours in that sense, which model discrete movements of central banks’
policy rates, for example, Rudebusch (1995), Piazzesi (2005), and Renne (2012). While
Renne (2012) also uses a regime-switching process to model the discrete values of the ECB’s
policy rate, we allow a discrete policy rate only at the ELB. Otherwise, the state variables
follow a Gaussian vector autoregression (VAR) as in the literature. The advantages of our
model are twofold. First, it significantly reduces the state space for the regime-switching
process. Second, when the ELB is not binding, our model is essentially the GATSM, which
is the preferred model in the literature.

Modeling the short end of the yield curve with NIRP

The ELB introduces several new shapes for the short end of the yield curve. See the red solid
dots in Figure 1. In July 2013, the front end of the yield curve was flat. This flatness was the
basic pattern we see in the data when the US experienced the ZLB, and most efforts in the
term structure literature for the ZLB focus on this feature.1 However, the NIRP introduced
additional patterns: in both February 2016 and July 2016, for example, the yield curves were

example.

downward sloping, implying future decreases in the policy rate. Interestingly, the very short
ends for the two months are different: in February 2016, an easing future monetary policy
stance was expected throughout all horizons, whereas in July 2016, the very short end of the
curve was flat, suggesting the cut would not happen in the next month.
We build a simple and intuitive model to capture these shapes in the short end of the
yield curve in Figure 1. We model the risk-neutral Q dynamics of the deposit rate. When
the ELB is binding, the forward rate at maturity n is approximately the Q expectation of
the deposit rate n-periods later. Hence the Q dynamics dictate the shape of the yield curve.
The physical dynamics take the same form with different parameter values.
We plot the dynamics of the deposit rate in Figure 2, and summarize some basic data features: (1) the deposit rate is discrete and rtd ∈{0, −0.1, −0.2, −0.3, −0.4, ...} percentage point,
and (2) the policy rate either stays where it was or moves down by 0.1%, which we formalize
with the following dynamics2 :

The simplest model with α1,t
= α1Q implies one shape of yield curve. See the left panel

of Figure 3. This model is a slightly more flexible version of the existing model (see Wu and
Xia (2016)), which imposes the restriction α1Q = 0. However, it cannot capture the other
shapes in the data; see Figure 1. In particular, it cannot capture both a flat curve (left
panel) and a downward sloping curve (middle and right panels).
To separate these two shapes, we introduce a binary random variable ∆t , which captures
agents’ forecast of the ECB’s next move. ∆t = 1 indicates a high probability of a cut next
period, whereas ∆t = 0 implies monetary policy is more likely to stay put. We augment

In the data, we have not observes the deposit rate move back up since the ELB. For a possible way to
incorporate future upward movements, see Wu and Xia (2017).

middle panel of Figure 3 provides an example of the two shapes. The blue line captures
that the yield curve in the state ∆t = 0 is flat, which corresponds to a long period of time
in the data during which the short end of the yield curve is flat, such as the left panel of
Figure 1. The red dashed line is for the state ∆t = 1, which sees a non-negligible probability
of the deposit rate moving down. This can explain the shape in the middle panel of Figure 1.
However, this model cannot capture the shape in the right panel of Figure 1. In this plot,

the market expects no immediate cut, but does expect a higher probability of a cut in future
meetings.
To accommodate this possibility, we devise a separation between the immediate monetary
policy stance ∆t and the longer-term monetary policy stance ∆lt . ∆lt = 1 implies an easier
monetary policy in longer horizons, whereas ∆lt = 0 implies a lower possibility for future
cuts. We introduce this channel by allowing the dynamics of the state variable ∆t to depend
on ∆lt , and (2.3) becomes

Our final model, constituting (2.2), (2.4), and (2.5), can capture various shapes of the
yield curve; see the right panel of Figure 3. ∆t = 1 corresponds to the case in which the
market highly expects a cut in the next period (see the red dashed line and purple dashdotted line), whereas ∆t = 0 corresponds to no immediate cut in the coming month (see the
blue solid line and yellow dotted line). ∆lt = 1 implies the market expects cuts not necessarily
immediately but in the future (see the yellow dotted and purple dash-dotted lines). When
∆lt = 0, agents do not anticipate much more policy actions past the next month (see blue
solid and red dashed lines). The combination of ∆t = 0 and ∆lt = 1 mimics the shape in the
right panel of Figure 1.

A new shadow rate term structure model

This section incorporates the dynamics for the deposit rate introduced in Section 2 to an
SRTSM, which we use to model the entire yield curve. Following Black (1995), the shortterm interest rate rt is the maximum function of the shadow rate st and a lower bound. The
innovation of our paper is that the lower bound is time varying:

rt = max(st , rt ).

(3.1)

Next, we describe how to model the lower bound and shadow rate, and then discuss how to
price bonds.

9

3.1

Deposit rate and lower bound

The deposit rate is by definition the lower bound of the Euro OverNight Index Average
(EONIA), and hence it naturally serves as the lower bound of the Overnight Index Swap
(OIS) curve based on EONIA. We use a discrete-time model with month-end observations as
in much of the term structure literature.3 However, central banks do not meet at the end of
the month. For our ELB sample, the ECB meets 8 to 12 times a year, at most once a month,
and the meeting dates range from the 1st to the 27th day of the month. We will treat this
calendar effect when we translate the deposit rate into the lower bound, because otherwise
the date mismatch could be misleading. For example, suppose the meeting occurs on the
16th day of the next month for a 30-day month, and suppose agents predict the central bank
will cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points with 100% chance. Then we will observe the one
month forward rate reduce by 5 basis points, because we know nothing will happen between
now and the 15th . If we do not treat the calendar effect, we will simply interpret the 5 basis
point change in the forward rate as a 50% chance for a 10 basis point cut.
We incorporate this calendar effect when we model the lower bound. Suppose the number
of days between the end of the current month t and the next meeting date is a fraction γt
of the month from t to t + 1. When the ELB is binding, the monthly lower bound rt is the
average of the overnight deposit rate for the month:

d
rt ≈ γt rtd + (1 − γt )EQ
t (rt+1 )

= rtd − (1 − γt )α1,∆t × 0.1.

(3.2)

Note we only align the ECB’s meeting schedule with our monthly data for the current month,
that is, as of time t,

d
rt+n = rt+n
, ∀n ≥ 1.
3

For example, see Hamilton and Wu (2012b), Bauer et al. (2012), and Wright (2011).

10

(3.3)

We assume rt = 0 if the economy is not at the ELB.

3.2

Shadow rate and factors

The shadow rate is an affine function of the latent yield factors, often labeled as “level,”
“slope,” and “curvature”:
st = δ0 + δ10 Xt ,
whose physical dynamics follow a first-order vector autoregression:

Xt = µ + ρXt−1 + Σεt , εt ∼ N (0, I).

(3.4)

Similarly, the risk-neutral Q dynamics are
Q
Xt = µQ + ρQ Xt−1 + ΣεQ
t , εt ∼ N (0, I).

3.3

Standard bond prices results

This section describes bond prices in general and how to price forward rate when the lower
bound is a constant. All the results we present here are standard in the literature. The new
results of our paper will be organized in Subsection 3.4.
The no-arbitrage condition specifies that prices for zero-coupon bonds with different
maturities are related by

Pnt = EQ
t [exp(−rt )Pn−1,t+1 ] .

The n-period yield relates to the price of the same asset as follows:
1
ynt = − log(Pnt ).
n

11

Following Wu and Xia (2016), we model forward rates rather than yields for the simplicity
of the pricing formula. Define the one-period forward rate fnt with maturity n as the return
of carrying a zero-coupon bond from t + n to t + n + 1 quoted at time t, which is a simple
linear function of yields:

fnt = (n + 1)yn+1,t − nynt .

Therefore, modeling forward rates is equivalent to modeling yields. Note that f0t = y1t = rt .
3.3.1

Forward rates with a constant lower bound

If the lower bound were a constant r, Wu and Xia (2016) show the forward rate can be
approximated by

where the function g(·) is

g(z) = zΦ(z) + φ(z),

(3.6)

and Φ(·) is the normal cumulative distribution function, while φ(·) is the normal probability
density function.
Inside the g function, an + b0n Xt is the n-period forward rate from the GATSM; see, for
example, Ang and Piazzesi (2003) and Bauer et al. (2012). The coefficients an and bn follow

New bond prices results

Next, we derive the pricing formula in our new model. We begin by describing the distribution of the lower bound.

3.4.1

Distribution of the lower bound

The probability distribution of interest for pricing purpose is the risk-neutral probability
distribution of the lower bound n periods into the future Qt (rt+n ). It can be written as the
sum of the joint distributions of the lower bound and ∆, ∆l states:

Qt (rt+n ) =

X

Qt (rt+n , ∆t+n , ∆lt+n ).

(3.7)

∆t+n ,∆lt+n

The right-hand side can be written as

Qt (rt+n , ∆t+n , ∆lt+n ) =

X

Qt (rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 )

rdt+n−1 ,∆t+n−1 ,∆lt+n−1

×Qt (rt+n , ∆t+n , ∆lt+n |rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 ),

13

(3.8)

where the transition probability can be decomposed as follows

Qt (rt+n , ∆t+n , ∆lt+n |rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 )
= Qt (rt+n |∆t+n , ∆lt+n , rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 )
×Qt (∆t+n |∆lt+n , rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 )
×Qt (∆lt+n |rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 )
= Q(rt+n |rt+n−1 , ∆t+n−1 )Q(∆t+n |∆t+n−1 , ∆lt+n−1 )Q(∆lt+n |∆lt+n−1 ).

(3.9)

The last equal sign is based on the assumptions in (2.2), (2.4), and (2.5), and the assumption
that the three variables are conditionally independent. The three terms in (3.9) are specified
in (2.2), (2.4), and (2.5).

3.4.2

Forward rates in the new model

With the results in Section 3.4.1, the pricing formula in (3.5) becomes

fnt ≈

X

rt+n +

σnQ g



an + b0n Xt − rt+n
σnQ

rt+n


Qt (rt+n ),

(3.10)

where Q(rt+n ) is specified in (3.7). Derivations for the new pricing formula are in Appendix
A.1.
The forward rate in (3.10) differs from (3.5) due to the time-varying lower bound. The
new pricing formula (3.10) prices in the uncertainty associated with the future dynamics of
the lower bound. The forward rate is calculated as an average of forward rates given rt+n ,
weighted by the risk-neutral probability distribution of rt+n . If rt+n were a constant, (3.10)
would become (3.5).
The regime-switching dynamics of (rtd , ∆t , ∆lt ) preserve the analytical approximation for
the pricing formula. Having an analytical approximation is crucial for the model to be
tractable and have better numerical behavior. Dynamic term structure models are often

14

criticized for being difficult to estimate. For example, in the class of GATSMs, which is a
special case of our model when rt → −∞ and has analytical bond prices, a literature has
been dedicated to improving the model’s performance.4 If we had to compute bond prices
numerically, the model would behave even worse.

Estimation

4.1

Data and estimation details

Data We model OIS rates on EONIA, and data is from Bloomberg. Our sample is monthly
from July 2005 to June 2017. We date the ELB period when the deposit rate is less than or
equal to zero starting from July 2012.

Spread The deposit rate is the floor for EONIA. In our model, they are the same for the
ELB sample. However, in the data, the former is always lower than the latter. To capture
this difference, we introduce a spread. The deposit rate is measured overnight. However, the
overnight EONIA rate is very volatile due to some month-end effects. Therefore, we define
the spread as the difference between the one-week EONIA-based OIS rate and the overnight
deposit rate: spt = rtweek − rtd . Figure 4 plots the time-series dynamics of the one-week OIS
rate and the overnight deposit rate in the top panel and their difference at the bottom to
demonstrate a non-zero and time-varying spread.
We assume the spread spt follows an AR(1) under the risk-neutral measure:

Forward rates We use OIS yields with the following maturities: three and six months, and
one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten years, and transform them into forward
rates. We transform yields into forward rates fnmt , defined as the return of a forward contract
carrying a bond from t + n to t + n + m, as follows:

fnmt =

1
[(n + m)yn+m,t − nynt ].
m

The forward rates we model include f3,3,t , f6,6,t , f12,12,t , f24,12,t , f60,12,t , f84,12,t , and f108,12,t .
fnmt relates to the forward rate in (4.2) with

fnmt =

1
(fnt + fn+1,t + ... + fn+m−1,t ).
m

(4.4)

There are a couple of advantages of modeling forwards rates over yields. First, forward
rates require summing over fewer terms per (4.4). Second, forward rates do not involve the
“max” operator, which is included in yields of any maturity. Having the “max” operator is
problematic for any gradient-based numerical optimizer.
State space form The state variables Xt , ∆t , and ∆lt are latent, whereas rtd and spt are
observed. Our SRTSM is a nonlinear state-space model. The transition equations include
(3.4), and the P version of (2.2), (2.4), (2.5), and (4.1), where we assume the same process
under the physical dynamics P and risk-neutral dynamics Q but with different parameters.
The difference between them captures the risk premium.
Adding measurement errors to (4.3) and (4.4), the measurement equations are

rto = rt + ηt
o
fnmt
= fnmt + ηnmt ,

where the “o” superscript stands for observed data, and the measurement errors are i.i.d.

(ii)µQ = 0, (iii) ρQ is diagonal with eigenvalues in descending order, and (iv) Σ is lower
triangular.

Estimation We estimate the model by maximum likelihood with the algorithm for regimeswitching state space models of Kim (1994) and the extended Kalman filter. The details are
in Appendix B. In practice, we impose rtd ∈{0,−0.1, −0.2, −0.3, −0.4,..., −1}, and therefore
d
Q(rt+1
= rtd − 0.1|rtd = −1, ∆t ) = 0.

We report maximum likelihood estimates and robust standard errors (see Hamilton
(1994)) in Table 1. The eigenvalues of ρ, ρQ indicate the factors Xt are highly persistent
under both measures. This finding is consistent with the term structure literature. Both
Q
α1,∆t =0 and α1,∆
are zero, which means that when ∆t = 0, agents do not expect the

deposit rate to change in the next period. When ∆t = 1, the probability of the ECB cutting

the deposit rate is much higher: α1,∆t =1 = 1 under the physical measure, and α1,∆

under the risk-neutral measure. The difference between the two measures reflects the risk
premium. The ∆t = 0 state is very persistent, with the probability of staying in this state

spt follows a persistent autoregressive process under both measures. Other parameters are
comparable to what we see in the literature.

Markets’ information on the NIRP

In this section, we extract the market’s expectations on the NIRP from the yield curve using
our SRTSM. We first filter out the probabilities for different policy states over time. Then
we extract the model implied probability of a rate cut, and compare it with some survey
data. Finally, we illustrate superior information contained in our model that is not available
in survey.
First, Figure 5 plots the filtered probability for each policy state. Blue is the dominant
state: it covers most of the space from December 2012 to September 2015 and from December
2016 to the end of the sample, which constitutes 70% of the ELB period. In this state, the
yield curve is basically flat (see the blue line in the right panel of Figure 3). The remainder
of the sample is mainly in yellow and purple. The probability of the purple state peaked
twice in November 2015 and February 2016, which are the months before the ECB lowered
the deposit rate to -0.3% and -0.4%, respectively. The purple area corresponds to the purple
line in the right panel of Figure 3, and the yield curve is downward sloping. The yellow
20

state corresponds to the yellow line in Figure 3, where the yield curve is initially flat, and
then slope downwards. This state indicates agents do not expect the central bank to cut
rates in the next month. However, they do expect future policy actions. The yellow area
dominates between July and November in 2012, and from March to November in 2016. The
least prominent state is in red, which implies agents expect the central bank to make an
immediate cut, but they also think this cut is the last one in the history. This scenario
appears less plausible.

Next, we compute the one-month ahead probability of a cut on the policy rate from our
model and compare it with the Bloomberg survey which is conducted one week before the
central bank’s scheduled meetings. Figure 6 plots the four actual cuts in blue vertical bars
together with our model predictions in red crosses and the Bloomberg survey expectations
in black dots. On June 5, 2014, the ECB cuts the rate from 0 to -0.1% for the first time.
In May, our model predicts this event with more than 50% probability. As a comparison,
over 90% of the respondents of the Blomberg survey expected the cut. The second cut in
21

September 2014 was a surprise to both economists and the market. The next two cuts from
-0.2% to -0.3%, and then subsequently to -0.4%, were largely anticipated. For the rest of the
meetings, market participants do not price in much probability of an immediate cut. This
exercise confirms market participants’ expectations are consistent with economists’ views.

The Bloomberg survey is conducted one week before each meeting. The yield curve,
however, contains richer information and further into the future. In Figure 7, we further
inspect for how long the market has anticipated some of the developments. It plots the
market’s expectations h months before the four event dates for h = 0, 1, 2, ..., 6. The blue
lines with crosses are the physical expectations Et−h (rtd ), the red lines with circles are the
d

risk-neutral expectations EQ
t−h (rt ), and the then deposit rates rt−h are in yellow dashed lines.

The difference between the blue or red and the yellow lines captures an anticipated rate cut.
For now, we focus on the risk-neutral expectations (in red), because the yield curve pins them
down more accurately. We will return to the difference between the physical and risk-neutral
expectations in Subsection 6.2.
22

Consistent with Figure 6, the June 2014 and December 2015 cuts were anticipated one
month ahead, whereas the September 2014 cut was completely unanticipated. The most
interesting case is March 2016. Under the risk-neutral expectation, a cut to -0.4% was
expected 4 months before, when the actual rate was -0.2%. Then agents revised up their
expectations for the next two months. Eventually, when h = 1, agents fully priced in the
-0.4% for the next month.

NIRP’s impact on the yield curve

6.1

Policy analyses

Assessing the impact of the NIRP is of great interest to both academia and policy makers,
and is one main goal of the paper. Different from the existing literature5 , we focus on the
NIRP’s passthrough to interest rates, which operates as the main channel for monetary
policy to affect the macroeconomy.
We are interested in the the following question: what would have happened if the ECB
had not cut the deposit rate or provided any forward guidance to markets? Specifically, we
examine how the yield curve would have behaved if the deposit rate was unchanged from the
previous month and both ∆ and ∆l were at state 0 on the four days when the ECB lowered
the deposit rate by 10 basis points.
We plot the results of the experiment in Figure 8. The upper panels plot counterfactual
(in blue circles) and observed (in purple lines) yield curves, while the lower panels plot their
differences in blue circles. For all four dates, the short end of the yield curve would have
been 10 basis points higher if it were not for the expansionary policy. However, the NIRP
had different impacts in the medium run. For June and September 2014, the differences
between the counterfactual and observed yield curves are downward sloping, whereas those
5

Much of the existing literature has focused on whether and how much the NIRP has affected banks’
profitability; see, for example, Borio et al. (2015), Jobst and Lin (2016), and Cœuré (2016).

for December 2015 and March 2016 have a humped shape.
To better understand this difference, we perform further experiments to decompose the
impact of a rate cut from that of forward guidance. First, we assume that the deposit rate
did not change, and plot it in red dashed lines. If the deposit rate were not cut, short-term
interest rates would have been about 10 basis points higher. Long-term interest rates would
also have been higher but by less amount. That is because the deposit rate is less relevant
for longer horizons, where the probability for the lower bound to bind becomes smaller.
In the second experiment, we assume that both ∆ and ∆l were 0, and plot it in yellow
crosses. Forward guidance did not have any impact on the first two dates, implying markets
did not price in any future cuts. In contrast, on the last two dates, forward guidance had
a sizable impact, mainly in the middle section. Specifically, markets expect further easing,
lowering the two-year rate by about 10 basis points.
The NIRP has a broader impact on the yield curve than just the four event dates. Figure 9

provides a complete picture of the NIRP over the entire ELB period. We plot the difference
between counterfactual and observed interest rates over time for short, medium, and long
maturities. The top, middle, and bottom panels correspond to counterfactuals where the
policy rate were not cut, forward guidance were absent, and both. From the top panels,
the impact of rate cut shows up only on the four dates studied in Figure 8, and it is more
prominent on the short end. Intuitively, forward guidance lowered the yield curve the month
before the first, third and fourth cuts. For the first one, it disappeared on the month of the
actual cut. However, for the last two event dates, forward guidance prevailed even when and
after the cut was realized, and it continued to put downward pressure on yields till late 2016.
Forward guidance also lowered the yield curve at the beginning of the sample in 2013. Across
different maturities, forward guidance has the most influence on medium-term interest rates,
2-year rate for example. The NIRP constitutes both rate cut and forward guidance.

6.2

Risk premium

In Figure 7, there is a wedge between the physical (in blue) and risk-neutral (in red) expectations of the deposit rate, which introduces a risk premium. Most of the time, risk-neutral
expectations are above or very close to physical expectations, reflecting a positive or near
zero risk premium. The intuition for this result is that risk-averse agents put more weight
on the bad state of the economy in the risk-neutral measure. Typically, agents associate a
rate cut with an expansionary monetary policy, which they expect to stimulate the economy.
Hence, we see higher risk-neutral expectations than their physical counterparts.
One prominent and interesting exception happened four months before March 2016, when
the difference between the risk-neutral and physical expectations was negative and reached
almost -10 basis points. In this case, economic agents might have taken a potential cut
in March 2016 as a sign of a weak economy, and hence put more weight into this “bad”
economic state.
A related concept is the term premium, which is one of the focal points for the term

structure literature.6 We plot the time series of the 10-year yield term premium for the Euro
area from our model in Figure 10. The overall term premium is in the blue solid line, and
that associated with the time variation of the deposit rate in the red dashed line. The red
line is positive and in the order of magnitude of 0.1%, which is consistent with what we find
in Figure 7.
The overall term premium has trended down since 2009. At the ELB, we observe some
negative term premia. This observation can mainly be attributed to the QE programs,
which purchase longer-term government bonds and reduce yields through the term premium
channel.7

to June 2017. First column: our main model Mmain ; second column: M∆t without ∆lt ; third column:
benchmark shadow rate model MS−T V with myopic agents and time-varying lower bound equal to the
deposit rate; fourth column: benchmark shadow rate model MS−0 with a constant lower bound at zero;
fifth column: benchmark shadow rate model MS−.4 with a constant lower bound at -0.4%; sixth column:
benchmark GATSM. Measurement errors are in basis points, and computed as the root-mean-square errors
between observed and model-implied short rates and forward rates. Forward rate fnmt is the forward contract
from t + n to t + n + m. We highlight the smallest measurement errors, and the highest log likelihood value.

and the corresponding lower bounds are specified as the current deposit rate, 0, and -0.4%,
respectively. Note, agents are not forward looking in terms of the lower bound in these
existing SRTSMs. The last column is the GATSM. See details in Appendix C.
Our main model has the highest likelihood value, and provides the best overall fit to the
forward curve with smaller measurement errors. All the evidence points to the conclusion
that the data favor our main model over these alternative model specifications.
Figure 11 provides some visual evidence by comparing the observed data in red dots with
yield curves implied by various models. When the ELB was not binding (see the top left
panel), all models fit the data similarly well. When the yield curve has a flat short end at the
beginning of the ELB (see the top right panel), our main model and M∆t provide a better
29

fit than other models. In theory, the existing shadow rate models MS−T V , MS−0 , and MS−.4
should be able to fit this pattern. But in practice, because they ignore the spread between
the deposit rate and EONIA, discrepancies appear at the very short end. The GATSM is
expected to perform poorly in this case, which is what motivates the entire literature on the
SRTSM. Not able to fit the flat short end of the yield curve makes the GATSM one of the
worst models; see Table 2.
In the bottom panels, none of the SRTSMs existing in the literature are able to generate a
downward sloping short end to mimic the data when the NIRP is in play. Intuitively, agents
in these models are myopic, and do not expect further development of the policy rate. Both
our main model and M∆t are able to generate a downward slope through agents’ expectations
that the future deposit rate might further decrease. However, M∆t is not flexible enough to
match the data for both February and August 2016. Our main model, which is motivated
by various shapes of the yield curve in Figure 1, fits all the dates well.

Conclusion

We have proposed a new shadow rate term structure model that captures the NIRP in the
Euro area. We model the discrete movement of the deposit rate with a simple and intuitive
regime-switching model. To capture various shapes in the short end of the yield curve, we
introduce two latent state variables: one for the immediate monetary policy stance, and the
other for future stance in longer horizons. We illustrate that the two do not always coincide,
and therefore, it is useful to have both of the indicators. Compared to alternative models,
including several SRTSMs proposed in the literature, and the GATSM, our new model fits
the data the best.
We use our model to extract the market’s expectations on the NIRP. Overall, expectations
of financial market participants from our model agree with economists’ expectations of the
Bloomberg survey. Our model has the advantage over the Bloomberg survey because we can

30

extract the market’s expectations further into the future, whereas the Bloomberg surveys
are collected only one week before meetings for monetary policy. We find the June 2014
and December 2015 cuts were expected the month before, and the September 2014 cut was
entirely unanticipated. Most interestingly, the March 2016 cut was expected 4 months before
the actual cut.
We then evaluate the NIRP’s impact on the yield curve with counterfactual policy analyses. The NIRP lowered the short end of the yield curve by 10 basis points on all four days
when ECB lowered the deposit rate. The impact decreased with maturity for the first two
dates. It featured a humped shape for the last two dates. Specifically, the biggest changes
happened for interest rates with maturities around 2 years, which would have been around
20 basis points higher if it were not for the NIRP actions.
We also measure the risk premium associated with the NIRP. We find most of the time,
this risk premium is positive or close to zero, which means agents typically associate a rate
cut with an expansionary monetary policy. One exception is four months before the March
2016 cut, when the difference between the risk-neutral and physical expectations was almost
-10 basis points. Our interpretation is that agents took a potential cut in March 2016 as a
sign of weak economic outlook. Relatedly, the NIRP also drives a small but positive term
premium on the 10-year yield.

rt = rtd for ELB. But agents are not forward looking, and think the future lower bound would stay
where it is today. Also, spt = 0. This specification
is similar to Lemke and Vladu (2016), and Kortela
(2016).
This model has a constant lower bound at 0, and
spt = 0. This is similar to Christensen and Rudebusch (2014), Wu and Xia (2016), and Bauer and
Rudebusch (2016).
This model is the same as the previous one, except
the lower bound is changed to -0.4%.
