    "abstract": "\n\nBoys are less likely than girls to enter college, a gap that is often attributed to a lack of non-cognitive skills such as motivation and self-discipline. We study how being classified as gifted \u2013 determined by having an IQ score of 116 or higher \u2013 affects college entry rates of disadvantaged children in a large urban school district. For boys with IQ\u2019s around the cutoff, gifted identification raises the college entry rate by 25-30 percentage points \u2013 enough to catch up with girls in the same IQ range. In contrast, we find small effects for girls. Looking at course-taking and grade outcomes in middle and high school, we find large effects of gifted status for boys that close most of the gaps with girls, but no detectable effects on standardized tests scores of either gender. Overall, we interpret the evidence as demonstrating that gifted services raise the non-cognitive skills of boys conditional on their cognitive skills, leading to gains in educational attainment.\n\n",
