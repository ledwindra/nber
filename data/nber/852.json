The decline of the manufacturing sector following an energy discovery has been termed the \"Dutch disease,\" and has been investigated in many recent studies. Our model extends the principally static analyses to date by allowing for: (1 ) short-run capital specificity and long-run capital mobility; (2) inter- national capital flows; and (3) far-sighted intertemporal optimizing behavior by households and firms. The model is solved by numerical simulation.\n\n",
