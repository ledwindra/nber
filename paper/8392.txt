Introduction

When an economic boom produces high output, employment, and investment in the
United States, there is usually a simultaneous boom in other industrialized countries.
But, why? Answering this question is a central goal of international macroeconomics.
The class of open-economy dynamic stochastic equilibrium models that have been
developed to this point have had good success at explaining how business cycles can
arise as an equilibrium response to “shocks” to productivity. However, multi-country
models have struggled with two major problems. The Þrst diﬃculty, which is a
problem shared by closed-economy models, is that the productivity shocks required
by the model are viewed as implausibly large and volatile. Second, the current crop
of open economy models have diﬃculty explaining why business cycles move together
so closely across countries: realistic international comovement of business cycles
requires implausibly high cross-country correlations of the productivity shocks.1
This paper investigates whether incorporating variable utilization of factor inputs
may be helpful in overcoming these diﬃculties. In the closed-economy models that
incorporate variable factor utilization, the response to exogenous shocks is enhanced.2
In these models, a productivity shock of a given size leads to a greater increase in
output when producers can vary the utilization rate of capital and/or the intensity
of labor eﬀort. Thus, a model with variable factor utilization should require less
volatility in exogenous productivity shocks in order to generate realistic levels of
output volatility.
In a multi-sector or a multi-country setting, however, variable factor utilization
may be even more important. The main problem with existing models of interacting
economies is their prediction of negative international comovement of factor inputs.
For example, these models predict that a productivity boom in the US that leads
to increases in US output, investment, and employment would be accompanied by
declines in investment and employment in Europe. However, this is not what we see
in the data: economic booms tend to occur in most developed countries at the same
time. The model mechanism that leads to this counterfactual prediction of negative
international comovement is the neoclassical investment accelerator, through which

See the discussion in Baxter (1995) and the references therein.
See, for example, the work of Bils and Cho (1994), Burnside and Eichenbaum (1996), and King
and Rebelo (1999), as well as related empirical analyses by Shapiro (1996) and Basu and Kimball
(1997).

investment respond strongly to increases in productivity that are expected to be
persistent. Thus, if productivity simultaneously rises in the US and in Europe, but
the increase in the US is somewhat larger, the models predict a strong investment
ßow out of Europe and into the US There is also an important role for interactions
of labor and capital in these models. When capital leaves Europe, the labor that
remains there becomes less productive. This will lead to declines in labor input in
Europe, which will set oﬀ another round of investment outßows because the decrease
in labor input reduces the productivity of the remaining capital. The sensitivity of
investment ßows to small diﬀerences in the return to capital means that productivity
shocks must be correlated in excess of 0.99 for the models to be able to generate
positive international factor comovement. This correlation is, of course, absurdly high
(a more realistic correlation is about 0.30). When Þrms can vary capital input via
increased utilization, rather than through an increase in investment or employment as
in standard models, the tendency for investment goods to ßow rapidly across countries
should be greatly diminished.
On the labor side, it is often thought that ‘labor hoarding’ is an important feature
of the business cycle. We follow the work of Bils and Cho (1994) in modeling labor
hoarding as variation in the eﬀort margin—during expansions, individuals will expend
more eﬀort during each hour worked. This is ‘labor hoarding’ in the sense that,
holding Þxed the capital stock and the total number of hours worked, the marginal
product of an hour worked is not constant over time. An attractive feature of this
speciÞcation of ‘labor hoarding’ is that it allows the labor market to clear through
variations in eﬀort.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our model of variable
factor utilization which incorporates variable capital utilization and labor hoarding.
Section 3 investigates the business-cycle properties of the variable utilization model.
We begin by studying the eﬀects of labor hoarding alone, and then look at the model
with variable capital utilization but no labor hoarding. Finally, we study a version
of the model that combines both avenues for variable factor utilization. Section 4
concludes with a summary of our results.

2

A model of variable factor utilization

There are two countries which together make up the world economy; both countries
produce the same good which may be used either for consumption or investment.
There is frictionless trade in the Þnal good.3 Trade in Þnancial assets is limited to a
non-contingent real bond.

2.1

Preferences

Our speciÞcation of preferences closely follows the work of Bils and Cho (1994) who
provide an attractive speciÞcation of preferences that permits separate decisions by
individuals with regard to employment, hours, and eﬀort. We assume that individuals residing in the home country maximize expected lifetime utility, given by the
following:
∞
X
max Et
β t+j U(Ct+j , Nt+j , Ht+j , Et+j ).
(1)
j=0

where Ct is consumption, Nt is weeks of work per period (employment), Ht is hours
worked per week, Et is eﬀort per hour, and β is the subjective rate of time discount.
Individuals in the foreign country are assumed to have the same subjective discount
factor and the same utility function; they maximize:
max Et

∞
X

∗
∗

∗
β t+j U(Ct+j

, Ht+j

).

(2)

j=0

We assume that the period-utility function U is separable in consumption and
labor, and that the home country utility derived from consumption is given by:
U(Ct , Nt , Ht , Et ) = log(Ct ) − V (Nt , Ht , Et ),

There are similar expressions for the foreign country. Throughout, the functions governing preferences and technology and the parameters of these functions are assumed

We study a one-good model because it is simplest and because it has the greatest potential for
reduction in investment volatility through variable factor utilization. Further, as documented in
Baxter (1995), the model of Backus, et al. (1994) which has diﬀerent goods produced by diﬀerent
countries has as great a problem with comovement as the standard, one-good model. Thus, little is
lost by focusing initially on a one-good, multi-location model.

to be the same across countries. This underlying symmetry allows us to focus on
the stochastic elements of the model as the only reason for asymmetric choices across
countries.

2.2

Technology

Home country output, denoted Yt , is produced using capital services, St , and ‘eﬀective’
units of labor, Lt :
Yt = At St1−α (Xt Lt )α ,
(5)
where At is the stochastic component of total factor productivity and Xt represents
the level of labor-augmenting technical progress, assumed to grow at a constant, gross
rate γ.
Capital services are the product of the capital stock, Kt , and the utilization rate,
Zt :
St = Zt Kt .
(6)
Total labor input, in eﬃciency units, is given by the product of total hours worked,
Nt Ht , and eﬀort exerted per hour, Et :
Lt = Nt Ht Et .

(7)

This model can be viewed as a model of ‘labor hoarding’ because output per
manhour will vary, holding capital services Þxed, through variation in eﬀort. Individuals will be paid the marginal product associated with their labor input measured
in eﬃciency units, so this model of ‘labor hoarding’ does not entail any departure
from competitive equilibrium.
We assume that increases in the utilization rate of capital are costly because higher
utilization rates imply faster depreciation rates; the depreciation function is δ(Zt ),
with δ 0 > 0 and δ 00 > 0.4 The stock of capital in place in the home country evolves
according to
Kt+1 = [1 − δ(Zt )]Kt + φ(It /Kt )Kt .
(8)
4

Our parameteriation of the depreciation function, which speciÞes only the steady state level,
slope, and curvature of the depreciation function, is consistent with the following functional form:
δt = δ +

b
(1+ζ)
Z
,
1+ζ t

with b > 0, δ > 0, and ζ > 0. The empirical estimates of Basu and Kimball (1997) support this type
of convex depreciation function.

5

This speciÞcation incorporates capital adjustment costs as described by Hayashi
(1982) and employed by Baxter and Crucini (1995). The adjustment cost function is
strictly positive with φ0 > 0 and φ00 < 0. Firms choose an optimal level of utilization,
as well as labor and capital inputs. When selecting an optimal rate of utilization,
Þrms must weigh the beneÞts of greater output against the costs of greater depreciation. There are foreign country analogues to eqns. (5)-(8); see the Appendix for
more detail.

2.3

Financial market structure

International trade in Þnancial assets is limited to one-period, real discount bonds.
These bonds sell at price PtB = (1 + rt )−1 , where rt is the world interest rate. Letting
Bt+1 denote the quantity of bonds purchased by residents of the home country at
date t, the asset-accumulation equation for the home country is:
Bt + Yt ≥ Ct + It + PtB Bt+1 .

(9)

The foreign country analogue is:
∗
.
Bt∗ + Yt∗ ≥ Ct∗ + It∗ + PtB Bt+1

(10)

We assume that bonds are in zero net supply, so world bond market clearing satisÞes
πBt + (1 − π)Bt∗ = 0,

(11)

where π is the fraction of the world population residing in the home country.

2.4

Model calibration

This sub-section describes the calibration of our model. The time period is a quarter
of a year.
Preferences The parameters µ, ϕ, and τ in equation (4) govern the compensated
elasticities of the employment, hours, and eﬀort responses to real wage movements.
The compensated elasticity of hours per week with respect to the real wage is equal
to 1/ϕ. Bils and Cho (1994) cite research by Pencavel (1986) and Killingsworth
and Heckman (1986) that suggests a compensated hours-per-week elasticity of 0.5,

6

corresponding to ϕ = 2, although Bils (1987) estimated a somewhat higher hoursper-week supply elasticity of about 0.7. Prescott (1986) assumes a higher value of
2.0 for the compensated elasticity of labor supply (corresponding to ϕ = 0.5). In
Prescott’s model, there is no variation in employment, so this higher elasticity is useful
in generating higher volatility in total labor input where all of the actual adjustment
is on the hours-per-week margin. In our baseline model, we choose ϕ = 2. In our
sensitivity analysis, we also report results for ϕ = 1.
Bils and Cho (1994) use PSID data to estimate that the standard deviation of
changes in weeks relative to changes in hours is (1 + ϕ)/µ = 1.91, which is the value
we adopt in our baseline model and also use throughout the sensitivity analysis. For
ϕ = 2, this implies µ = 1.57.
The parameter τ determines the elasticity of the eﬀort response. SpeciÞcally,
the elasticity of eﬀort with respect to the workweek is ϕ/(1 + τ ). Schor (1987) uses
data from time-and-motion studies and estimates a value of this elasticity that ranges
from ϕ/(1 + τ ) = 0.516 to ϕ/(1 + τ ) = 0.597, with a standard error in each case of
about 0.14. With ϕ = 2, ϕ/(1 + τ ) = 0.5 implies τ = 3, which is the value we
use in our baseline model. In our sensitivity analysis, we also experiment with an
eﬀort elasticity at the upper end of the 95% conÞdence interval estimated by Schor.
Finally, individuals’ subjective discount factor is set equal to β = 0.984.
Technology Labor’s share is equal to α = 0.58, and the gross growth rate of
labor-augmenting technical change is γ X = 1.004. The adjustment cost function
φ(i/k) is parameterized as follows. We set φ(i/k) = 1 and φ0 (i/k) = 1 in order to
ensure that the steady state of the model is unaﬀected by incorporating adjustment
costs. Given φ(i/k) = φ0 (i/k) = 1, the elasticity of (i/k) with respect to movements
in Tobin’s q is governed by the curvature of the adjustment cost function, φ00 (i/k).
There are no micro studies that can tell us the appropriate setting for this parameter.
However, it has been noted in past research that this elasticity primarily aﬀects the
volatilities of investment (and, of course, consumption) relative to output. As in
Baxter and Crucini (1993, 1995) and Baxter (1995), we can use information on the
relative volatility of investment to restrict the value of this elasticity, setting η = 15.
As in prior studies, this value of the adjustment cost elasticity means that investment
is about 3 times as volatile as output in the absence of variable factor utilization.
Incorporating variable utilization introduces a new parameter, ζ, which represents
7

the elasticity of marginal depreciation with respect to the utilization rate:
ζ=

Zδ 00 (Z)
> 0.
δ 0 (Z)

Our parameterization of ζ is guided by the empirical work of Basu and Kimball (1997),
who estimate a log-linear production function incorporating variations in both capital
utilization and eﬀort for a panel of US Þrms from 21 manufacturing industries for the
period 1949-1985. They estimate ζ to be approximately unity. They stress, however,
that “the data are not very informative” about this parameter. The 95% conÞdence
interval of [−0.2, 2] indicates that the data cannot reject even inÞnitesimally small
values of ζ, although the negative values should be eliminated on purely economic
grounds. In our baseline model, we specify ζ = 1. In our sensitivity analysis, we
also investigate the eﬀects of reducing the elasticity of marginal depreciation with
respect to utilization, by studying the eﬀects of ζ = 0.10 and ζ = 0.05.
Productivity The exogenous process for de-meaned, detrended productivity is
speciÞed as a bivariate V AR(1):
·

log At
log A∗t

¸

=

·

ρ ν∗
ν ρ∗

¸·

log At−1
log A∗t−1

¸

+

·

.

(12)

Many researchers have attempted to estimate the parameters of this process; see,
for example, the work of Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1993), Reynolds (1993), and
Baxter and Crucini (1995). It has proved impossible to estimate the parameters of
(12) with much precision, even if one is willing to abstract from variable utilization,
so that the standard “Solow residual” measure of productivity:
log SRt = log Yt − (1 − α)Kt − αNt

(13)

is also the correct measure of true productivity, At .
These prior studies have suggested several qualitative features of the standard
“Solow residual” measure of the productivity shocks. First, the shock process is
highly persistent; Baxter and Crucini (1995) show that one cannot reject the hypothesis that the productivity shocks follow a near-unit-root processes. Second, the
innovations to productivity are positively correlated: cov(εt , ε∗t ) > 0. It is less clear
whether there is transmission of shocks from one country to another over time (ν > 0
and/or ν ∗ > 0); while the point estimates of Backus, Kehoe and Kydland do suggest
8

transmission, especially from the US to other countries, the results of Reynolds (1993)
and Baxter and Crucini (1995) Þnd that the transmission parameters are not statistically signiÞcant. In light of these results, we parameterize our productivity process
as a near-unit-root process without spillovers, ρ = ρ∗ = 0.999; ν = ν ∗ = 0. We
specify that corr(εt , ε∗t ) = 0.258, which is consistent with estimates obtained in the
various empirical studies discussed above. This parameterization of the productivity
process will be used for all of the model variants that we study.
It remains to specify the variances of the innovations, εt and ε∗t . The usual
procedure (see, for example, Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1993) or Baxter (1995)) is
to estimate the innovation variances and then calibrate the model using this estimate.
In the present paper, however, we use a diﬀerent approach. In each variant of the
model that we study, we will calibrate the innovation variance of the productivity
shocks so that the volatility of output in the model economy exactly matches the
volatility of output observed in US data. This will allow us to easily evaluate how
the required volatility of the productivity shocks changes as we incorporate labor
hoarding and variable capital utilization.
Finally, the model is solved using the solution algorithm described in King and
Watson (1998); the details are contained in the Appendix.

Variable factor utilization and business cycle moments

This section explores how variable factor utilization aﬀects the business-cycle moments generated by our two-country international business cycle model. We begin
by reviewing the properties of the data and the moments generated by the baseline
model without variable capital or labor utilization. We then explore how the model’s
predictions are altered when we allow (i) labor hoarding alone; (ii) variable capital
utilization alone; and (iii) labor hoarding and variable capital utilization together.

3.1

The data and the baseline model

Table 1 shows the business-cycle properties of the data together with the predictions
of a baseline model that abstracts from variable factor utilization. The businesscycle components of the data are extracted using the BP12 (6, 32) band-pass Þlter
described in Baxter and King (1999). The business-cycle properties of US data
9

are well-known, so we review these only brießy. Consumption is less volatile than
output, while investment is approximately three times as volatile as output. We
present statistics for employment, hours per week, and total hours separately, since
our model of labor hoarding will have implications for each of these variables. In
US data, the percentage variation in employment is nearly four times as volatile as
variation in hours per week. Real wages are about half as volatile as output, and
net exports are about one-quarter as volatile as output.
Our model with variable capital utilization will have predictions for the behavior
of the capital stock, the rate of capital utilization, and the rate of capital services.
Unfortunately, none of these variables is measured well in the data. A measure of
the utilization rate is published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, but this is a measure of the “output gap” rather than being a direct measure
of the services supplied by the capital stock. An empirical measure of capital services
is not available.
All the macro aggregates that we consider are highly autocorrelated, with Þrstorder autocorrelation coeﬃcients ranging from 0.88 to 0.97. Consumption, investment, the labor variables, the utilization rate, and real wages are all positively correlated with output. The capital stock is approximately acyclical, while net exports
are countercyclical.
Cross-country properties of the data are shown in the bottom panel of Table
1. The key stylized facts are as follows. Outputs are positively correlated across
countries, as are consumptions, although cross-country consumption correlations are
well-known to be smaller than corresponding cross-country output correlations in
most cases. The cross-country correlation of investment tends to be positive, as does
the cross-country correlation of labor input (the empirical measure reported here is
employment).
To construct moments for the baseline model without variable factor utilization,
we choose the variability of the productivity shock process (var(εt )) so that the
standard deviation of output in the model exactly matches the empirical standard
deviation of output: 1.69% per quarter. In this model, this means that the (Þltered)
standard deviation of the productivity shock is 1.54% per quarter—the productivity
shock is 0.91 times as volatile as output. The Solow residual is computed as in
equation (13); this is equivalent to the true productivity shock when there is no
variability in factor utilization.
10

In our baseline model, consumption is nearly as volatile as output, while relative
consumption volatility is somewhat lower in US data.5 Investment in our model
is about three times as volatile as output, which is a bit higher than the relative
volatility exhibited by the data. In the baseline model, all of the variation in total
hours occurs through variation in hours per week. Compared with the data, the
variation in hours per week is too high, while the variation in total hours is too low.
Partly, the low variation in total hours reßects the absence of employment ßuctuations
in the model; partly, it reßects the fact that our baseline model has an elasticity of
hours with respect to the real wage that is one-quarter of the size of the elasticity
typically used in “real business cycle” models. Our model predicts a relatively low
correlation of hours with output, compared with the data. At the same time, the
predicted correlation of real wages with output is much too high, relative to the data.
The model correctly predicts that net exports are negatively correlated with output,
and the magnitude of this correlation is also approximately correct.
Looking at cross-country correlations, we Þnd that the model predicts that output
correlations exceed consumption correlations, which is a well-known feature of the
international data. Both correlations are within the range of observations for OECD
countries. However, the output correlation is on the high side of its range: the
model predicts a cross-country output correlation of 0.61; the range of correlations
in the data is [-0.35, 0.81] with a median of 0.29. The consumption correlation is on
the low side of its range, with a model prediction of -0.37. In the data, consumption
correlations are in the range [-0.62,0.67] with a median of 0.12.
Strikingly, the model predicts that investment and labor input will be negatively
correlated across countries: 0.41 for investment, -0.34 for hours. This pattern is a
common feature of most international business cycle models, yet it is not the pattern
observed in the data. The median cross-country investment correlation in the data
is 0.25; for employment, the median correlation is 0.26, and for hours, the median
correlation is 0.43. Thus, one important goal of this research is to determine whether
variable factor utilization can improve the predictions of our model for the crosscountry comovement of factor inputs.
As noted earlier, the productivity shock must be 0.91 times as volatile as output in
order for the model to match the observed volatility of output. This shock is highly

However, the relative volatility of consumption is low in the US relative to other countries. In
Japan, for example, consumption is about as volatile as output. See Baxter (1995) for more details.

11

persistent, with Þrst-order autocorrelation of 0.90; it is also highly correlated with
output, with a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.93. The high volatility of the productivity
shock is frequently viewed as a problem for this class of models, as it implies a
signiÞcant probability of technical regress. Further, the very high required persistence
of the shock is evidence of weak internal propagation mechanisms in these models.
Thus, a second goal of this paper is to determine whether variable factor utilization
can be successful in reducing the volatility and persistence of the productivity shock
that is required for the model to mimic the salient business-cycle features of the data.

3.2

Labor hoarding

This section explores the eﬀect of introducing variable labor utilization via the labor
hoarding model of Bils and Cho (1994). In order to explore the eﬀect of reasonable perturbations of the parameters of the labor hoarding model, Table 2 presents
moments for three cases.
Case 1 is the Bils-Cho parameterization, with ϕ = 2, µ = 1.57, and τ = 3.
Case 2 increases the compensated hours elasticity to 1 by setting ϕ = 1. We
continue to assume that the standard deviation of changes in weeks relative to changes
in hours is (1 + ϕ)/µ = 1.91; for ϕ = 1, this implies µ = 1.05. The elasticity of eﬀort
with respect to the workweek is ϕ/(1 + τ ), which was estimated to approximately
0.5. With ϕ = 1, ϕ/(1 + τ ) = 0.5 implies τ = 1.
Case 3 increases the eﬀort elasticity relative to Case 1, setting ϕ = 1, µ = 1.05,
and τ = 0.14. This implies an eﬀort elasticity of ϕ/(1 + τ ) = 0.88 which is at the
upper end of the 95% conÞdence interval implied by the estimates of Schor (1987).
In the Bils-Cho parameterization, Case 1, the relative volatilities of consumptionand investment are both too high, as was true in the baseline model. The Bils-Cho
parameterization has trouble matching the empirical volatility of employment (the
model predicts 0.44% per quarter, while the data show 1.44%), and the predicted
volatility of hours is also too low at 0.19% per quarter, compared with 0.38% in the
data. These two factors combined mean that the model’s prediction for the volatility
of total hours (0.57%) is only about a third as large as in the data (1.69%). As in the
baseline model, real wage volatility continues to be too high, as does the volatility of
net exports.
The hours elasticity used by Bils and Cho is substantially smaller than the elasticity commonly used in other quantitative macro models (see, e.g., Prescott (19xx)).
12

When we increase the hours elasticity to 1 (Case 2), the volatility employment rises,
although not by enough to match the data. The volatility of hours rises as well, and
approaches the level found in the data. The volatility of eﬀort rises as well. As a
combination of these three eﬀects, the volatility of eﬀort. The volatility of eﬀective
labor jumps sharply, from 0.66% per quarter to 1.02% per quarter. The volatility of
real wages also rises, which is not desirable, as real wages were already too volatile
in the Bils/Cho case (case 1).
There is a small increase in the volatility of net
exports which, again, is not desirable. Case 3, which combines a high hours elasticity with a high eﬀort elasticity leads to further increases in volatility in employment,
hours, and eﬀort. While the hours volatility is approximately correct in case 3, the
increase in volatility of employment still leaves the model to predict less than half
the employment volatility seen in the data.
One motivation for introducing variable factor utilization was to reduce the required volatility of productivity shocks, relative to the baseline models. However,
introducing labor hoarding in the particular form chosen here has very little eﬀect
on the volatility of productivity shocks that is required to match the volatility of
output. In the benchmark economy (Table 1), the productivity shock was 0.91 times
as volatile as output. The Bils/Cho speciÞcation, Case 1, requires productivity to be
0.92 times as volatile as output. Increasing the elasticities of various components of
labor input leads to slight reductions in the required relative volatility of productivity:
0.90 in case 2, and 0.87 in case 3.
Table 2 does not report predictions for Þrst-order autocorrelation. We found that
there was no eﬀect (at 2 signiÞcant digits) on the model’s autocorrelation properties
of introducing labor hoarding, regardless of which case is considered. Thus, we
conclude that the Bils/Cho model of labor hoarding does not reduce the required
volatility or persistence of productivity shocks in our two-country model.
Varying the labor hoarding parameters across the three cases leads to relatively
small eﬀects on the within-country correlations with output. In all three cases, the
model produces correlations of employment and hours with output that are too low,
compared with the data. Further, as we move from case 1 to case 3, the consumptionoutput correlation and the investment-output correlation become implausibly low,
while the correlation between net exports and output—which is approximately correct
in the Bils/Cho setup—rises toward zero.
Looking at the cross-country correlations, we Þnd that the Bils-Cho version of the
13

labor hoarding model shares all the diﬃculties of the baseline model: output correlations that are a bit too high, and negative cross-country correlations of consumption,
investments, and labor inputs. As we increase the hours elasticity (Case 2) and the
hours and eﬀort elasticities together (Case 3), the model’s predicted correlation of
investments rises, but never becomes positive. Worse, labor input correlations grow
even more strongly negative as we move from Case 1 to Case 3.
Overall, we conclude that incorporating “labor hoarding” along the lines suggested
by Bils and Cho does not lead to a signiÞcant alteration of the predictions generated
by our two-country macro model. First, productivity shocks must still be nearly
as volatile as output and nearly as autoccorelated, if the model is to be able to
match volatility and persistence properties of the macro data. Second, the model
with labor hoarding continues to predict strong, negative cross-country correlation
between factor inputs.

3.3

Variable capital utilization

This sub-section explores the implications of variable capital utilization for the businesscycle properties of the model. We consider three cases,which correspond to diﬀerent
values of ζ, the parameter that governs the elasticity of the utilization response (lower
values of ζ imply a more-elastic response). The Þrst case sets ζ = 1, which is the
Basu-Kimball (1997) point estimate. We consider two additional cases, corresponding
to higher utilization elasticities: ζ = 0.10, and ζ = 0.05. Given the imprecision in
the Basu-Kimball estimates, both of these alternative values of ζ are within the 95%
conÞdence interval. The results for these three cases are presented in Table 3.
A major Þnding is that the variable capital utilization model dramatically reduces
the required volatility of productivity shocks. Recall that the baseline model (Table
1) required productivity shocks that were 91% as volatile as output. The highestelasticity case of the labor hoarding model reduced this number to just 87%. By
contrast, Case 1 of the utilization model requires that productivity shocks are only
73% as volatile as output. With higher utilization elasticities, the required volatility
of productivity shocks falls to 57% of output volatility (Case 2), and 55% (Case 3).
Although variable capital utilization is successful in reducing the required volatility
of productivity shocks, there was not eﬀect on the required persistence of the shock.
We found that the autoregressive properties of the model were unchanged, relative
to the benchmark model, by incorporating variable utilization. For this reason, we
14

do not report these autocorrelations for the variable-utilization model.
Comparing Cases 1-3, we Þnd that increasing the elasticity of the utilization response (i.e., decreasing ζ), aﬀect the within-county characteristics of business cycles
along several dimensions. First, the relative volatilities of consumption, the capital
stock and net exports all decline to levels more consistent with the data. However, more-elastic capital utilization works to reduce investment volatility and hours
volatility, which is not desirable as the model already underpredicted the volatility of
these variables. The correlations of the macro aggregates with output change with
increases in the elasticity of utilization: increasing elasticity raises the correlation
of output with consumption, investment, hours, and real wages, which is undesirable
since many of these correlations were too high to begin with. However, increasing
the utilization elasticity reduces the correlation between output and the capital stock,
which is a move in the right direction.
Introducing variable capital utilization leads to remarkable improvement in the
cross-country correlations of consumption, investment, and labor input. SpeciÞcally,
increases in the utilization elasticity lead to an increase in the cross-country consumption correlation, to the point where this correlation is now very consistent with the
data. Output correlations decrease slightly as the utilization elasticity rises, but in
all three cases, consumption correlations are smaller than output correlations, as is
true in the data.
The most important eﬀect of allowing variable utilization is the eﬀect on the crosscountry correlations of factor inputs. Increasing the utilization elasticity increases
the cross-country correlations of investment, hours, and real wages.
In Cases 2
and 3, the cross-country correlations of investment and hours are positive, and are
consistent with the range observed in the data. Further, the cross-country correlation
of real wages in the baseline model was −0.16, compared with 0.43 in the data. With
variable utilization, the real wage correlation rises to a level close to that to the level
observed in the data (0.25 in case 2). Neither the standard model, nor the model with
labor hoarding alone, could produce this pattern of positive cross-country correlation
in hours, investment, or real wages..
Finally, the cross-country correlation of the standard Solow residual is higher
than the cross-country correlation of the true productivity shocks; this discrepancy
is higher with more-elastic utilization. This Þnding reßects the fact that the capital services are positively correlated across countries when utilization is variable;
15

these capital services are included in the standard Solow residual but not in the true
productivity residual.

3.4

Combining labor hoarding and variable capital utilization

This sub-section explores the eﬀects of combining labor hoarding with variable capital
utilization. In the prior two sub-sections, we found that labor hoarding alone did
little to change the properties of the basic model, while variable capital utilization
led to many signiÞcant improvements. Although labor hoarding was not important in isolation, it may have signiÞcant eﬀects when combined with variable capital
utilization.
Table 4 presents the results obtained in a model that combines labor hoarding
with variable capital utilization. Three cases are presented. Case 1, which we
view as a “benchmark” case, uses the Bils-Cho parameterization of labor hoarding
(Case 1 in Table 2) together with the Basu-Kimball point estimate of ζ = 1 for the
depreciation elasticity (Case 1 in Table 3). Case 2, which we term the “moderately
elastic case,” uses the parameters from Case 2 in Tables 2 and 3. Case 3, the “highly
elastic case,” uses Case 3 parameters from Tables 2 and 3.
Overall, we Þnd that combining labor hoarding with variable capital utilization
leads to model predictions that are very similar to those obtained in a model with
variable capital utilization alone. Notably, the reduction in the required volatility of
productivity is virtually the same in the combined model as in the utilization-only
model.
The few diﬀerences are as follows. First, adding labor hoarding to the variablecapital-utilization model leads to lower correlations between total hours and output,
which is undesiragle as this correleation is quite high in the data. On the positive
side, incorporating labor hoarding also generally improves the correlation between net
exports and output. The cross-country correlations of factor inputs remain positive
in cases 2 and 3, as in the case with variable capital utilization alone. The crosscountry correlation of hours appears very sensitive to the parameterization of capital
utilizaiton and the incorporation of labor hoarding. SpeciÞcally, the hours correlation
rises with increases in the utilization elasticity in the utilization-only model of Table
3. However, as we move from Cases 1 to 3 in the combined model of Table 4, the
hours correlation Þrst rises then falls.

Summary and conclusion

This paper explores the importance of variable utilization of factor inputs for open
economy business cycles. We incorporate labor hoarding through a model suggested
by Bils and Cho (1994), and we incorporate variable capital utilization through a
standard depreciation-in-use speciÞcation. We study the eﬀects on model predictions
of each of these modiÞcations separately, and then study the eﬀect of combining the
two margins for variable factor utilization.
Our main Þndings are as follows. Labor hoarding alone has virtually no eﬀect on
the model’s predictions, compared with a standard two-country business cycle model.
By contrast, variable capital utilization improves the predictions of the model along
two important dimensions. First, variable capital utilization reduces the required
volatility of the productivity shock by a very signiÞcant 20% − 40%. Second, variable capital utilization is very eﬀective in strengthening the model’s predicted crosscountry correlations between factor inputs. Finally, we found that combining labor
hoarding with variable capital utilization has little eﬀect on the model’s predictions,
compared with the model with variable utilization alone.

The Solow residual for each country is computed as
log(SRt ) = log(Yt ) − sn ∗ log(EM Pt ),
where SRt is the Solow residual, Yt is output, sn is labor’s share (0.58) and EMPt is
employment.

There are similar equations for home-country variables. World bond market clearing
is given by
πbt + (1 − π)b∗t = 0.
(29)
The world general equilibrium is solved by incorporating the bond market clearing equation with the home accumulation equation, and imposing the equilibrium
condition PtB = βEt (pt+1 /γpt ) = βEt (p∗t+1 /γp∗t )in the accumulation equations. The
resulting system of equations is then linearized around the deterministic steady state
(as in the following subsection) and solved using the algorithm of King and Watson
