    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper examines the effect of alcohol consumption on student achievement.  To do so, we exploit the discontinuity in drinking at age 21 at a college in which the minimum legal drinking age is strictly enforced.  We find that drinking causes significant reductions in academic performance, particularly for the highest-performing students.  This suggests that the negative consequences of alcohol consumption extend beyond the narrow segment of the population at risk of more severe, low-frequency, outcomes.\n\n",
