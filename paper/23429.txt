Why You Should Never Use the Hodrick-Prescott Filter

NBER Working Paper No. 23429

JEL No. C22,E32,E47
ABSTRACT
Here's why. (1) The HP filter produces series with spurious dynamic relations that have no basis
in the underlying data-generating process. (2) Filtered values at the end of the sample are very
different from those in the middle, and are also characterized by spurious dynamics. (3) A
statistical formalization of the problem typically produces values for the smoothing parameter
vastly at odds with common practice, e.g., a value for λ far below 1600 for quarterly data. (4)
There's a better alternative. A regression of the variable at date t+h on the four most recent values
as of date t offers a robust approach to detrending that achieves all the objectives sought by users
of the HP filter with none of its drawbacks.

Introduction.

Often economic researchers have a theory that is specified in terms of a stationary environment,
and wish to relate the theory to observed nonstationary data without modeling the nonstationarity. Hodrick and Prescott (1981, 1997) proposed a very popular method for doing this, commonly
interpreted as decomposing an observed variable into trend and cycle. Although drawbacks to
their approach have been known for some time, the method continues today to be very widely
adopted in academic research, policy studies, and analysis by private-sector economists.

For

this reason it seems useful to collect and expand on those earlier concerns here and note that
there is a better way to solve this problem.

Characterizations of the Hodrick-Prescott filter.

Given T observations on a variable yt , Hodrick and Prescott (1981, 1997) proposed interpreting
the trend component gt as a very smooth series that does not differ too much from the observed
y t .1

When the smoothness penalty λ → 0, gt would just be the series yt itself, whereas when λ → ∞
the procedure amounts to a regression on a linear time trend (that is, produces a series whose
second difference is exactly 0). The common practice is to use a value of λ = 1600 for quarterly
time series.

Phillips and Jin (2015) reviewed the rich prior history of generalizations of this approach.

The solution to (1) is then given by2
g ∗ = (H 0 H + λQ0 Q)−1 H 0 y = A∗ y.

(2)

The inferred trend gt∗ for any date t is thus a linear function of the full set of observations on y
for all dates.
As noted by Hodrick and Prescott (1981) and King and Rebelo (1993), the identical inference
can alternatively be motivated from particular assumptions about the time-series behavior of the
trend and cycle components. Suppose our goal was to choose a value for a (T × 1) vector at
such that the estimate g̃t = a0t y has minimum expected squared difference from the true trend:
minE(gt − a0t y)2 .

The solution to this problem is the population analog to a sample regression coefficient, and is
a function of the variance of y and its covariance with g:
−1

g̃ = E(gy 0 ) [E(yy 0 )]

y = Ãy.

(4)

As an example of a particular set of assumptions we might make about these covariances, let ct
denote the cyclical component and vt the second difference of the trend component:
yt = gt + ct

(5)

gt = 2gt−1 − gt−2 + vt .

(6)

Suppose that we believed that vt and ct are uncorrelated white noise processes that are also
uncorrelated with (g0 , g−1 ), and let C0 denote the (2×2) variance of (g0 , g−1 ). These assumptions
imply a particular value for Ã in (4). As we let the variance of (g0 , g−1 ) become arbitrarily large
(represented as C0−1 → 0), then in every sample the inference (4) would be numerically identical
to expression (2).
Proposition 1. For λ = σ 2c /σ 2v and any fixed T, under conditions (5)-(6) with ct and vt
white noise uncorrelated with each other and uncorrelated with (g0 , g−1 ), the matrix Ã in (4)
converges to the matrix A∗ in (2) as C0−1 → 0.
The proposition establishes that if researcher 1 sought to identify a trend by solving the
minimization problem (1) while researcher 2 found the optimal linear estimate of a trend process
that was assumed to be characterized by the particular assumption that vt and ct were both
white noise, the two researchers would arrive at the numerically identical series for trend and
cycle provided the ratio of σ 2c to σ 2v assumed by researcher 2 was identical to the value of λ used
by researcher 1.

The Kalman smoother is an iterative algorithm for calculating the population linear projection (4) for models where the variance and covariance can be characterized by some recursive
structure.3

In this case, (5) is the observation equation and (6) is the state equation. Thus

as noted by Hodrick and Prescott, applying the Kalman smoother to the above state-space
model starting from a very large initial variance for (g0 , g−1 )0 offers a convenient algorithm for
calculating the HP filter, and is in fact a way that the HP filter is often calculated in practice.
Nevertheless, this observation should also be a bit troubling for users of the HP filter, in that
they never defend the claim that the particular structure assumed in Proposition 1 is an accurate
representation of the true data-generating process. Indeed, if a researcher did know for certain
that these equations were the true data-generating process, and further knew for certain the
value of the population parameter λ = σ 2c /σ 2v , he would probably be unhappy with using (2) to
separate cycle from trend! The reason is that if this state-space structure was the true DGP,
the resulting estimate of the cyclical component ct = yt − g̃t would be white noise– it would
be random and exhibit no discernible patterns.

By contrast, users of the HP filter hope to

see suggestive patterns in plots of the series that is supposed to be interpreted as the cyclical
component of yt .
Premultiplying (2) by H 0 H + λQ0 Q gives a system of equations whose tth element is
[1 + λ(1 − L−1 )2 (1 − L)2 ]gt∗ = yt

for t = 1, 2, ..., T − 2

(7)

for L the lag operator (Lk xt = xt−k , L−k xt = xt+k ). In other words, F (L)gt∗ = yt for
F (L) = 1 + λ(1 − L−1 )2 (1 − L)2 .

Figure 1 plots the values of φ1 and φ2 generated by different values of λ. For λ = 1600,
φ1 = 1.777 and φ2 = −0.7994. These imply R = 0.8941, so that the absolute value of the
weights decay with a half-life of about 6 quarters while R60 = 0.0012.5

Related results have been developed by Singleton (1988), King and Rebelo (1989, 1993), Cogley and Nason
(1995), and McElroy (2008). Unlike these papers, here I provide simple direct expressions for the values of φ1
and φ2 , and my analytical expressions of the HP filter entirely in terms of real parameters in (9) and (10) appear
to be new.

The other parameters for this case are C = 0.056075, m = 0.111687 and cot(m) = 8.9164.

As noted by King and Rebelo, obtaining the cyclical component for these observations thus
amounts to taking fourth differences of the original yt+2 and applying the operator [F (L)]−1 to
the result, so that the HP cycle might be expected to produce a stationary series as long as
fourth-differences of the original series are stationary. However, De Jong and Sakarya (2016)
noted there could still be significant nonstationarity coming from observations near the start or
end of the sample, and Phillips and Jin (2015) concluded that for commonly encountered sample
sizes, the HP filter may not successfully remove the trend even if the true series is only I(1).

3.1

Drawbacks to the HP filter.
Appropriateness for typical economic time series.

The presumption by users of the HP filter is that it offers a reasonable approach to detrending
for a range of commonly encountered economic time series. The leading example of a time-series
process for which we would want to be particularly convinced of the procedure’s appropriateness
would be a random walk. Simple economic theory suggests that variables such as stock prices
(Fama, 1965), futures prices (Samuelson, 1965), long-term interest rates (Sargent, 1976; Pesando,
1979), oil prices (Hamilton, 2009), consumption spending (Hall, 1978), inflation, tax rates, and
money supply growth rates (Mankiw, 1987) should all follow martingales or near martingales. To
be sure, hundreds of studies have claimed to find evidence of statistically detectable departures
from pure martingale behavior in all these series. Even so, there is indisputable evidence that
6

a random walk is often extremely hard to beat in out-of-sample forecasting comparisons, as has
been found for example by Meese and Rogoff (1983) and Cheung, Chinn, and Pascual (2005)
for exchange rates, Flood and Rose (2010) for stock prices, Atkeson and Ohanian (2001) for
inflation, or Balcilar, et al. (2015) for GDP, among many others.

Certainly if we are not

comfortable with the consequences of applying the HP filter to a random walk, then we should
not be using it as an all-purpose approach to economic time series.
For yt = yt−1 +εt , where εt is white noise and (1−L)yt = εt , Cogley and Nason (1995)6 noted
that expression (15) means that when the HP filter is applied to a random walk, the cyclical
component for observations near the middle of the sample will approximately be characterized
by

q2t = −0.79εt+1 +3.37εt −5.37εt−1 +3.79εt−2 −εt−3 . The underlying innovations εt are completely
random and exhibit no patterns, whereas the series ct is both highly predictable (as a result of
the dependence on lags of εt−j ) and will in turn predict the future (as a result of dependence
on future values of εt+j ). Since the coefficients that make up [F (L)]−1 are determined solely by
the value of λ, these patterns in the cyclical component are entirely a feature of having applied

the HP filter to the data rather than reflecting any true dynamics of the data-generating process
itself.
For example, consider the behavior of stock prices and real consumption spending.8

The

top panels of Figure 2 show the autocorrelation functions for first-differences of these series,
confirming that there is little ability to predict either from its own past values, as we might
have expected from the literature cited at the start of this section. The lower panels show cross
correlations. Consumption has no predictive power for stocks, though stock prices may have a
modest ability to anticipate changes in aggregate consumption.
Figure 3 shows the analogous results if we tried to remove the trend by HP filtering rather
than first-differencing. The HP cyclical components of stock prices and consumption are both
extremely predictable from their own lagged values as well as each other. The rich dynamics in
these series are purely an artifact of the filter itself and tell us nothing about the underlying datagenerating process. Filtering takes us from the very clean understanding of the true properties
of these series that we can easily see in Figure 2 to the artificial set of relations that appear in
Figure 3. The values plotted in Figure 3 summarize the filter, not the data.

3.2

Properties of the one-sided HP filter.

The HP trend and cycle have an artificial ability to “predict” the future because they are by
construction a function of future realizations. One way we might try to get around this would
be to restrict the minimization problem in (3), forcing at to load only on values (yt , yt−1 , ..., y1 )0
8

Stock prices were measured as 100 times the natural log of the end-of-quarter value for the S&P 500 and
consumption from 100 times the natural log of real personal consumption expenditures from the U.S. NIPA
accounts. All data for this figure are quarterly for the period 1950:1 to 2016:1.

that have been observed as of date t, rather than also using future values as was done in the HP
filter (4). The value of this one-sided projection for date t could be calculated by taking the
end-of-sample HP-filtered series for a sample ending at t, repeated for each t.9
The top panel of Figure 4 shows the result of applying the usual two-sided HP filter to stock
prices. The trend is identified to have been essentially flat throughout the 2000s, with the prerecession booms and post-recession busts in stock prices viewed entirely as cyclical phenomena.
The bottom panel shows the results of applying a one-sided HP filter to the same data. This
would instead identify the trend component as rising during economic expansions and falling
during recessions.

The reason is that a real-time observer would not know in early 2009, for

example, that stock prices were about to appreciate remarkably, and accordingly would have
judged much of the drop observed up to that date to be permanent. It is only with hindsight
that we are tempted to interpret the 2008 stock-market crash as a temporary phenomenon.
Making use of unknowable future values in this way is in fact a fundamental reason that HPfiltered series exhibit the visual properties that they do, precisely because they impose patterns
that are not a feature of the data-generating process and could not be recognized in real time.
Some researchers might be attracted by the simple picture of the “long-run” component of stock
prices summarized by the top panel of Figure 4. But that picture is just something that their
imagination has imposed on the data. And the end-of-sample value obtained from the procedure
is actually quite different from what the researcher is seeing in the middle of the sample.
Moreover, although a one-sided filter would eliminate the problem of generating a series that
9

An easier way to calculate the one-sided projection is with a single pass of the Kalman filter through the
entire sample for the state-space model assumed in Proposition 1 with C0 large and σ 2c /σ 2v = 1600. The Kalman
filter gives the one-sided projection while the Kalman smoother gives the usual two-sided HP filter.

9

is artificially able to predict the future, changes in both the one-sided trend and its implied
cycle are readily forecastable from their own lagged values, and likewise by values of any other
variables. Again this is not a feature of the stock prices themselves, but instead is an artifact
of choosing to characterize the cycle and trend in this particular way.

3.3

Data-coherent values for λ.

A separate question is what value we should use for the smoothing parameter λ. Hodrick and
Prescott motivated their choice of λ = 1600 based on the prior belief that a large change in
the cyclical component within a quarter would be around 5%, whereas a large change in the
trend component would be around (1/8)%, suggesting a choice of λ = σ 2c /σ 2v = (5/(1/8))2 =
1600. Ravn and Uhlig (2002) showed how to choose the smoothing parameter for data at other
frequencies if indeed it would be correct to use 1600 on quarterly data. These rules of thumb
are almost universally followed.
It’s worth noting that if the state-space representation in Proposition 1 were indeed an
accurate characterization of the trend that we were trying to infer, we would not need to make
up a value for λ but could in fact estimate it from the data. If for example we assumed a Normal
distribution for the innovations (vt , ct )0 we could use the Kalman filter to evaluate the likelihood
function for the observed sample (y1 , ...., yT )0 and find the values for σ 2v and σ 2c that maximize
the likelihood function.10

This could alternatively be given a quasi-maximum likelihood

interpretation as a GLS minimization of the squared forecast errors weighted by reciprocals of
10

See for example Hamilton (1994, equations [13.4.1]-[13.4.2]). Note that although the inferred value for the
trend gt depends only on the ratio σ 2c /σ 2v , the parameters σ 2c and σ 2v are separately identifiable because σ 2c can
be inferred from the average observed size of (yt − gt )2 .

10

their model-implied variance.
Table 1 reports MLEs of σ 2v , σ 2c , and λ for a number of commonly studied macroeconomic
series. For every one of these we would estimate a value for σ 2c whose magnitude is similar to,
and in fact often smaller than, σ 2v , and certainly not 1600 times as large.11

If we used a value

of λ = 1 instead of λ = 1600, the resulting series for gt would differ little from the original data
yt itself; λ = 1 implies a value for R in expression (10) of 0.48, which decays with a half-life of
less than one quarter.
Thus not only is the HP filter very inappropriate if the true process is a random walk. As
commonly applied with λ = 1600, the HP filter is not even optimal for the only example (namely
(5)-(6)) for which anyone has claimed that it might provide the ideal inference!

4

A better alternative.

Here I suggest an alternative concept of what we might mean by the cyclical component of a
possibly nonstationary series: how different is the value at date t + h from the value that we
would have expected to see based on its behavior through date t?12
component has several attractive features.

This concept of the cyclical

First, as noted by den Haan (2000), the forecast

error is stationary for a wide class of nonstationary processes. Second, the primary reason that
we would be wrong in predicting the value of most macro and financial variables at a horizon
11

Nelson and Plosser (1982, pages 157-158) have also made this observation.

12

This idea is related to Beveridge and Nelson’s (1981) definition of the trend component of yt as gt = lim

h→∞

lim E(yt+h |yt , yt−1 , .., yt−p+1 ) which limit exists and can be calculated provided that (1 − L)yt is a mean-zero

p→∞

stationary process. Beveridge and Nelson then (somewhat curiously) interpreted the cyclical component as ct =
gt −yt . By contrast, here we keep h and p fixed and take advantage of the fact that gt = E(yt+h |yt , yt−1 , .., yt−p+1 )
exists for a broad range of nonstationary processes. We interpret the cyclical component at date t + h as ct+h =
yt+h − gt .

11

of h = 8 quarters ahead is cyclical factors such as whether a recession occurs over the next two
years and the timing of recovery from any downturn.13
While it might seem that calculating this concept of the cyclical component requires us
already to know the nature of the nonstationarity and to have the correct model for forecasting
the series, neither of these is the case.

We can instead always rely on very simple forecasts

within a restricted class, namely, the population linear projection of yt+h on a constant and the
4 most recent values of y as of date t. This object exists and can be consistently estimated for
a wide range of nonstationary processes, as I now show.

4.1

Forecasting when the true process is unknown.

Suppose that the dth difference of yt is stationary for some d. For example, d = 2 would mean
that the growth rate is nonstationary but the change in the growth rate is stationary. Note the
dth difference is also stationary for any series with a deterministic time trend characterized by
a dth-order polynomial in time. For any such process we can write the value of yt+h as a linear
function of initial conditions at time t plus a stationary process.

For example, when d = 1,

letting ut = ∆yt we can write
(h)

(16)

yt+h = yt + wt
(h)

where the stationary component is given by wt

= ut+1 + · · · + ut+h . For d = 2 and ∆2 yt = ut ,
(h)

yt+h = yt + h∆yt + wt
(h)

where now wt

= ut+h + 2ut+h−1 + · · · + hut+1 . This result holds for general d, as demonstrated

in the following proposition.
13

(17)

This same consideration suggests using h = 24 for monthly data and h = 2 for annual data.

12

Proposition 3. If (1 − L)d yt is stationary for some d ≥ 1, then for all finite h ≥ 1,

for s = 2, 3, ..., d and wt

is

a stationary process.
It further turns out that if ∆d yt ∼ I(0) and we regress yt+h on a constant and the d most
recent values of y as of date t, the coefficients will be forced to be close to the values implied
(j)

by the coefficients κh in Proposition 3.

For example, if ∆2 yt is I(0) then in a regression of
(h)

yt+h on (yt , yt−1 , 1)0 , the fitted values will tend to yt + h(yt − yt−1 ) + µh for µh = E(wt ) as the
sample size gets large; that is, the coefficient on yt will go to 1 + h and the coefficient on yt−1
will go to −h. The implication is that the residuals from a regression of yt+h on (yt , yt−1 , 1)0 will
be stationary whenever y itself is I(2). The reason is that any other values for these coefficients
would imply a nonstationary series for the residuals, whose sum of squares become arbitrarily
large relative to those implied by the coefficients 1 + h and −h as the sample size grows large.
If ∆d yt is stationary and we regress yt+h on a constant and the p most recent values of
y as of date t for any p > d, the regression will use d of the coefficients to make sure the
residuals are stationary and the remaining p + 1 − d coefficients will be determined by the
(h)

parameters that characterize the population linear projection of the stationary variable wt

on

the stationary regressors (∆d yt , ∆d yt−1 , ..., ∆d yt−p+d+1 , 1)0 . The following proposition provides a
formal statement of these claims. In the proof of this proposition I have followed Stock (1994,
p. 2756) in defining a series ut to be I(0) if it has fixed mean µ and satisfies a Functional Central

13

Limit Theorem.14

This requires that the sample mean of ut has a Normal distribution as the

sample size T gets large, as does a sample mean that used only T r observations for 0 < r ≤ 1.

polynomial in time (ut = yt − δ 0 − δ 1 t − δ 2 t2 − · · · − δ d td ) satisfies (18), then we can remove the

(h)

If p > d, the OLS residuals converge to the residuals from a population linear projection of wt
on (∆d yt , ∆d yt−1 , ..., ∆d yt−p+d+1 , 1)0 .

Stock (1994, p. 2749) demonstrated that an example of sufficient conditions that imply (18) is that ut =
P
∞
µ + j=0 ψ j η t where η t is a martingale difference sequence with variance σ 2 and finite fourth moment, ψ(1) 6= 0,
P∞
and j=0 j|ψ j | < ∞, in which case ω 2 in (18) is given by σ 2 [ψ(1)]2 . Alternatively, Phillips (1987, Lemma 2.2)
derived (18) from primitive moment and mixing conditions on ut .
15

The reason to state these as two separate possibilities is that if the nonstationarity is purely deterministic,
then the dth differences will not satisfy the Functional Central Limit Theorem. For example, if yt = γ 0 + γ 1 t + εt
with εt white noise, then ∆yt = γ 1 + ψ(L)εt for ψ(L) = 1 − L and ψ(1) = 0. Of course when ut = ∆d yt
satisfies (18) with µ 6= 0, the series yt has both dth-order stochastic as well as dth-order deterministic polynomial
trends, so that case, along with pure stochastic trends (µ = 0) and pure deterministic trends are all allowed by
Proposition 4.

14

Proposition 4 establishes that if we estimate an OLS regression of yt+h on a constant and the
p = 4 most recent values of y as of date t,

yt+h = β 0 + β 1 yt + β 2 yt−1 + β 3 yt−2 + β 4 yt−3 + vt+h ,

(20)

v̂t+h = yt+h − β̂ 0 − β̂ 1 yt − β̂ 2 yt−1 − β̂ 3 yt−2 − β̂ 4 yt−3

(21)

the residuals

offer a reasonable way to construct the transient component for a broad class of underlying
processes. The series is stationary provided that fourth differences of yt are stationary, a goal
that HP intends but does not necessarily achieve. But whereas the approximation to the HP
filter in equation (15) imposes all 4 unit roots, the sample regression would only use 4 differences
if it is warranted by observed features of the data. The proposed procedure has a number of other
advantages over HP. First, any finding that v̂t+h predicts some other variable xt+h+j represents
a true ability of y to predict x rather than an artifact of the way we chose to detrend y, by virtue
of the fact that v̂t+h is a one-sided filter16 . Second, unlike the HP cyclical series ct+h , the value
of v̂t+h will by construction be difficult to predict from variables dated t and earlier.17 If we find
such predictability, it tells us something about the true data-generating process, for example,
that x Granger-causes y. Third, the value of v̂t+h is a model-free and essentially assumptionfree summary of the data.

Regardless of how the data may have been generated, as long as

(1 − L)d yt is covariance stationary for some d ≤ 4, there exists a population linear projection of
16

While the OLS coefficients (19) make use of future observations, this influence vanishes asymptotically, in
contrast to HP’s first-order dependence on future observations. Expression (22) below offers another alternative
that allows zero inference of future observations for any sample size T.
17

Note however that ct+h by construction can be predicted by variables known at date t + h − 1. The value of
ct+h will be correlated with its own lagged values ct+h−1 , ct+h−2 , ..., ct+1 but likely uncorrelated with ct , ct−1 , ...

15

yt+h on (yt , yt−1 , yt−2 , yt−3 , 1)0 . That projection is a characteristic of the data-generating process
that can be used to define what we mean by the cyclical component of the process and can be
consistently estimated from the data. Given a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium or any
other theoretical model that would imply an I(d) process, we could calculate this population
characteristic of the model and estimate it consistently from the data.

4.2

Properties in some common settings.

Random walk. Given the literature cited in Section 3.1 it is instructive to examine the consequences if this procedure were applied to a random walk: yt = yt−1 + εt . In this case, d = 1
(h)

and wt

= εt+h + εt+h−1 + · · · + εt+1 . For large samples, the OLS estimates of (20) converge to

β 1 = 1 and all other β j = 0, and the resulting filtered series would simply be the difference
ṽt+h = yt+h − yt ,

(22)

that is, how much the series changes over an h = 8-quarter horizon, or equivalently the sum
of the observed changes over h periods. Note that for h = 8 the filter 1 − Lh wipes out any
cycles with frequency of exactly one year, and thus is taking out both the long-run trend as
well as any strictly seasonal components.18

This also fits with the common understanding of

what we would mean by the cyclical component. Because the simple filter (22) does not require
estimation of any parameters, it can also be used as a quick robustness check for concerns about
the small-sample applicability of the asymptotic claims in Proposition 4, as will be illustrated
in the applications below.
As in Hamilton (1994, pp. 171-172), the filter 1 − L8 has power transfer function (1 − e−8iω )(1 − e8iω ) =
2 − 2 cos(8ω) which is zero at ω = 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π and thus eliminates not only cycles at the zero frequency
but also cycles that repeat themselves every 8,4,8/3, or 2 quarters. See also Hamilton (1994, Figures 6.5 and
6.6).
18

16

Deterministic time trend. Another instructive example is a pure deterministic time trend of
order d = 1: yt = δ 0 + δ 1 t + εt for εt white noise. In this case ∆yt = δ 1 + εt − εt−1 is stationary
(h)

and wt

= ∆yt+1 + · · · + ∆yt+h = δ 1 h + εt+h − εt is also stationary for any h. I show in the

appendix that for this case the limiting coefficients on yt , .., yt−p+1 described by Proposition 4
are each given by 1/p and the implied trend for yt+h is
δ 0 + δ 1 (t + h) + p−1 (εt + εt−1 + · · · + εt−p+1 ).

(23)

Even for p = 1 this is not a bad estimate and for p = 4 should not differ much from the true
trend δ 0 + δ 1 (t + h). Again regardless of the choice of p, the difference between yt+h and (23)
will be stationary.
Interpreting DSGE’s. A third instructive example is when yt is an element of a theoretical
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that is stationary around some steady-state value
µ. If the effects of shocks in the theoretical model die out after h periods, then the linear
projection (20) in the theoretical model is characterized by β 0 = µ and β 1 = β 2 = β 3 = β 4 = 0.
In other words, the component vt+h is exactly the deviation from the steady state. If shocks have
not completely died out after h periods, then part of what is being labeled trend by this method
would include the components of shocks that persist longer than h periods. But for any value
of h, the linear projection is a well-defined population characteristic of the theoretical stationary
model, and there is an exactly analogous object one can calculate in the possibly nonstationary
observed data. The method thus offers a way to make an apples-to-apples comparison of theory
with data of the sort that users of the HP filter often desire, but which the HP filter itself will
always fail to deliver.
17

4.3

Specification of p and h.

One might be tempted to use a richer model than (20) to forecast yt+h , such as using a vector of
variables, more than 4 lags, or even a nonlinear relation. However, such refinements are completely unnecessary for the goal of extracting a stationary component, and have the significant
drawback that the more parameters we try to estimate by regression, the more the small-sample
results are likely to differ from the asymptotic predictions.

The simple univariate regression

(20) is estimating a population object that is well defined regardless of whether the variable is
part of a large vector system with nonlinear dynamics. For this reason, just as the HP filter
is always implemented as a univariate procedure, my recommendation is to follow that same
strategy for the approach here.
A related issue is the choice of h. For any fixed h, there exists a sample size T for which
the results of Proposition 4 hold. However, a bigger sample size T will be needed the bigger is
h. The information in a finite data set about very long-horizon forecasts is quite limited. If
we are interested in business cycles, a 2-year horizon should be the standard benchmark. It is
also desirable with seasonal data to have both p and h be integer multiples of the number of
observations in a year. Hence for quarterly data my recommendation is p = 4 and h = 8.
In other settings the fundamental interest could be in shocks whose effects last substantially
longer than two years but are nevertheless still transient. A leading example would be the recent
interest in debt cycles prompted by datasets such as developed by Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor
(2016). For such an application I would use h = 5 years, with the regression-free implementation
(yt+5 − yt ) having particular appeal given the length of datasets available.

18

4.4

Empirical illustrations.

Figure 5 shows the results when this approach is applied to data on U.S. total employment.
The raw seasonally adjusted data (yt ) are plotted in the upper left panel. The residuals from
regression (20) estimated for these data are plotted in black in the lower-left panel, while the
8-lag difference (22) is in red. The latter two series behave very similarly in this case, as indeed
I have found for most other applications. The primary difference is that the regression residual
has sample mean zero by construction (by virtue of the inclusion of a constant term in the
regression) whereas the average value of (22) will be the average growth rate over a two-year
period.
One interesting observation is that the cyclical component of employment starts to decline
significantly before the NBER business cycle peak for essentially every recession. Note that this
inference from Figure 5 is summarizing a true feature of the data and is not an artifact of any
forward-looking aspect of the filter.
The right panels of Figure 5 show what happens when the same procedure is applied to
seasonally unadjusted data. The raw data themselves exhibit a very striking seasonal pattern,
as seen in the top right panel. Notwithstanding, the cyclical factor inferred from seasonally unadjusted data (bottom right panel) is almost indistinguishable from that derived from seasonally
adjusted data, confirming that this approach is robust to methods of seasonal adjustment.
Figure 6 applies the method to the major components of the U.S. national income and
product accounts. Investment spending is more cyclically volatile than GDP, while consumption
spending is less so.

Imports fall significantly during recessions, reflecting lower spending by

19

U.S. residents on imported goods, and exports substantially less so, reflecting the fact that
international downturns are often decoupled from those in the U.S. Detrended government
spending is dominated by war-related expenditures– the Korean War in the early 1950s, the
Vietnam War in the 1970s, and the Reagan military build-up in the 1980s.
Table 2 reports the standard deviation of the cyclical component of each of these and a
number of other series, along with their correlation with the cyclical component of GDP. We
find very little cyclical correlation between output and prices.19

Both the nominal fed funds

rate and the ex ante real fed funds rate (the latter based on the measure in Hamilton, et al.,
2016) are modestly procyclical, whereas the 10-year nominal interest rate is not.

Conclusion.

The HP filter is intended to produce a stationary component from an I(4) series, but in practice
it can fail to do so, and invariably imposes a great cost. It introduces spurious dynamic relations
that are purely an artifact of the filter and have no basis in the true data-generating process,
and there exists no plausible data-generating process for which common popular practice would
provide an optimal decomposition into trend and cycle.

There is an alternative approach

that can isolate a stationary component from any I(4) series, preserves the underlying dynamic
relations and consistently estimates well-defined population characteristics for a broad class of
possible data-generating processes.
19

Identifying the sign of this correlation was one of the primary interests of den Haan’s (2000) application of
a related methodology. In contrast to the results in Table 2, he found a positive correlation between the cyclical
components of these series. I attribute the difference to differences in sample period.

Appendix.
Derivation of equation (2). The minimization problem (1) can be written
min {(y − Hg)0 (y − Hg) + λ(Qg)0 (Qg)} .
g

The derivative with respect to g is −2H 0 (y − Hg) + 2λQ0 Qg and setting this to 0 gives (2).
Derivation of equation (4). Define ãt = [E(yy 0 )]−1 E(ygt ). For any at we have
E(gt − a0t y)2 = E(gt − ã0t y + ã0t y − a0t y)2
= E(gt − ã0t y)2 + 2E[(gt − ã0t y)y 0 ](ãt − at ) + (ãt − at )0 E(yy 0 )(ãt − at ).
The middle term equals 0 by the definition of ãt :
E[(gt − ã0t y)y 0 ](ãt − at ) = {E(gt y 0 ) − E(gt y 0 )[E(yy 0 )]−1 E(yy 0 )}(ãt − at ).
Hence E(gt − a0t y)2 is minimized when at = ãt . Stacking ã0t y into a (T̃ × 1) vector gives (4).

which from (29) goes to 0 as C0−1 → 0. Since the matrices premultiplying and postmultiplying
the left side of (31) are of full rank, this establishes that A∗ = Ã as claimed.
Proof of Proposition 2. Let θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , θ4 be the roots satisfying F (θi ) = 0. As noted
by King and Rebelo (1989), since λ > 0, F (z) in (8) is positive for all real z meaning that θi
comprise two pairs of complex conjugates. Since F (z) = F (z −1 ), if θi is a root, then so is θ−1
i .
Thus the values of θi are given by Reim , Re−im , R−1 eim , and R−1 e−im for some fixed R and m;
one pair is inside the unit circle and the other is outside. Noting that the coefficients on z 2 and
z −2 in F (z) are both λ, it follows that F (z) can be written
−1
−1
−1
F (z) = λ(1 − θ1 z)(1 − θ2 z)(θ−1
1 − z )(θ 2 − z ).

From the symmetry of F (z) in z and z −1 we can without loss of generality normalize θ1 and θ2
to be inside the unit circle and write
F (z) =

λ
(1 − θ1 z)(1 − θ2 z)(1 − θ1 z −1 )(1 − θ2 z −1 ).
θ1 θ2
27

Define (1 − φ1 z − φ2 z 2 ) = (1 − θ1 z)(1 − θ2 z), namely φ1 is the real number θ1 + θ2 and φ2 is the
negative real number −θ1 θ2 . Note also that the roots of (1 − φ1 z − φ2 z 2 ) = 0 are the complex
−1
conjugates θ−1
1 and θ 2 , which are both outside the unit circle. This gives the bounds on φ1

and φ2 stated in Proposition 2 as in Hamilton (1994, Figure 1.5). Then
F (z) =

λ
(1 − φ1 z − φ2 z 2 )(1 − φ1 z −1 − φ2 z −2 ).
−φ2

(32)

Evaluating (8) and (32) at z = 1 gives
F (1) = 1 = (1 − φ1 − φ2 )2 λ/(−φ2 )

(33)

as claimed in (12), Likewise evaluating (8) and (32) at z = −1 gives
F (−1) = 1 + 16λ = (1 + φ1 − φ2 )2 λ/(−φ2 ).

(34)

Taking the difference between these last two equations establishes (4φ1 − 4φ1 φ2 )λ/(−φ2 ) = 16λ
or φ1 (1 − φ2 ) = −4φ2 as claimed in (11). Note that since φ2 < 0 (required by complex roots),
from (11) φ1 > 0.
I next establish that

The coefficient on (z 2 + z −2 ) will be zero provided B0 = −C0 , or provided
1 = [C0 − 2C1 φ1 − C0 φ21 − C0 φ22 ] + [C1 − C1 φ2 − C0 φ1 φ2 ](z + z −1 ).

(36)

The coefficient on (z + z −1 ) will be zero provided

C1 =

C0 φ1 φ2

(37)

where the last equation made use of (11). Substituting (37) into (36), we see that (35) will be

(38)

We know that the coefficient on z j for j = 0 must be 1, requiring [2α cos(0) + 2β sin(0)] = 1 or
α = 1/2. We likewise know that the coefficient on z j for j = 1 is given by φ1 , so R[cos(m) +
2β sin(m)] = φ1 , which from (14) gives R2β sin(m) = φ1 /2 or 2β sin(m) = cos(m) so 2β =
cot(m). Substituting these values for α and β into (38) gives (10).

which immediately gives the result of Proposition 3 for the case d = 1 as stated in (16). We

is a finite sum of stationary variables and therefore is itself stationary.

Proof of Proposition 4. Note that the fitted values and residuals implied by the coefficients
in (19) are numerically identical to those if we were to do the (infeasible) regression yt+h =
x̃0t α + vt+h for
x̃t = (ũt , ũt−1 , ..., ũt−p+d+1 , 1, ∆d−1 yt , ∆d−2 yt , ..., ∆yt , yt )0
with ũt = ∆d yt − µ. The latter regression is infeasible because we do not know the true values
of µ and d. But because the fitted values are the same, once we find the properties of the second
regression, we will also know the properties of the first. For example, for d = 2 and p = 4,

The first p − d terms are just the sample means of stationary variables, which by the Law of

Large Numbers converge in probability to their expectation E(ũt−j w̃t ). Term p − d + 1 likewise
(h)

converges to E(w̃t ) = 0. Calculations analogous to those behind Lemma 1(e) in Sims, Stock
and Watson (1990) show that the last d terms in (45) also all converge in probability to zero.20

projection coefficients g, the p − d + 1 term to E(wt ), and the last d elements of α̂ converge to

Alternatively, adding a nonzero initial condition, e.g. replacing ξ t

(1)

(1)

(1)

with ξ t + ξ 0 for ξ 0
(1)

any fixed constant produces a term that is still dominated asymptotically by ξ t , and as in Park
and Phillips (1989), the original convergence claims again all go through.
Finally, the derivations are very similar for the case of purely deterministic time trends,

Notes to Table 2. Filtered series were based on the full sample available for that variable, while
correlations were calculated using the subsample of overlapping values for the two indicators. Note
that the regression residuals lose the first 11 observations and the random-walk calculations lose the
first 8 observations.

Notes to Figure 4. Red line in both panels plots 100 times natural log of S&P 500 stock price index. The
black curve in the top panel plots the HP estimate of trend as inferred using the usual two-sided filter
(calculated using the Kalman smoother for the state-space model in Proposition 1), whereas the black
curve in the bottom panel plots trend from a one-sided HP filter (calculated using the Kalman filter for
the same model). Shaded regions denote NBER recession dates.
