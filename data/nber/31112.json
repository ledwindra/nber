    "abstract": "\n\nThe present study examines the assumptions, modeling structure, and preliminary results of DICE-2023, the revised Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE), updated to 2023. The revision contains major changes in the carbon and climate modules, the treatment of non-industrial greenhouse gases, discount rates, as well as updates on all the major components. The major changes are a significantly lower level of temperature of the cost-benefit optimal policy,  a lower cost of reaching the 2\u00b0 C target, an analysis of the impact of the Paris Accord, and a major increase in the estimated social cost of carbon.\n\n",
