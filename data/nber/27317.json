    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how firms\u2019 expectations and actions are affected by both aggregate and industry-specific conditions using a survey of French manufacturing firms. We document two novel features. First, the adjustment of firms\u2019 expectations is more rapid after industry-specific shocks than aggregate shocks. This is consistent with rational inattention models which predict that firms should pay more attention to industry variation than aggregate conditions. Second, in response to industry shocks that have no aggregate effects, firms\u2019 aggregate expectations respond. This is consistent with \u201cisland\u201d models in which firms use the specific prices they observe to make inferences about broader aggregate conditions. We also study how these results vary across industries.\n\n",
