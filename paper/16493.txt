Counter-Suicide-Terrorism: Evidence from House Demolitions
Efraim Benmelech, Claude Berrebi, and Esteban Klor
NBER Working Paper No. 16493
October 2010
JEL No. H56,K42,O53
ABSTRACT
This paper examines whether house demolitions are an effective counterterrorism tactic against suicide
terrorism. We link original longitudinal micro-level data on houses demolished by the Israeli Defense
Forces with data on the universe of suicide attacks against Israeli targets. By exploiting spatial and
time variation in house demolitions and suicide terror attacks during the second Palestinian uprising,
we show that punitive house demolitions (those targeting Palestinian suicide terrorists and terror operatives)
cause an immediate, significant decrease in the number of suicide attacks. The effect dissipates over
time and by geographic distance. In contrast, we observe that precautionary house demolitions (demolitions
justified by the location of the house but not related to the identity or any action of the house’s owner)
cause a significant increase in the number of suicide terror attacks. The results are consistent with
the view that selective violence is an effective tool to combat terrorist groups, whereas indiscriminate
violence backfires.

1. Introduction
Although it is commonly argued that government policies to deter terrorism and disrupt the
operations of terror organizations tend to be effective (Ganor, 2005), alternative theoretical
models suggest that they may have a boomerang effect. According to this view, harsh measures
of counterterrorism backfire by fostering hatred and attempts to exact revenge (Siqueira and
Sandler, 2006). In particular, while counterterrorism policies typically affect the general
population, the effectiveness of counterterrorism policies depends on their ability to target terror
organizations directly.1
However, despite the wide interest that counterterrorism policies draw and the abundance
of related theoretical studies, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of
counterterrorism measures. Assessing the effectiveness of counterterrorism policies requires
detailed micro-level data on terror attacks and counterterrorism operations. Unfortunately, such
detailed data are typically not publicly available.
This paper attempts to fill this gap by linking novel micro-level data on house demolitions
(a policy used by the Israeli Defense Forces [IDF] to combat and deter terrorism) and suicide
attacks, empirically documenting the effects of house demolitions on future suicide attacks. We
differentiate between the two main types of house demolitions carried out by the IDF:
precautionary demolitions and punitive house demolitions. Precautionary demolitions are
intended to prevent the launching of attacks from specific locations and are not related to
activities carried out by the owners or occupants of the houses being demolished. In contrast, in
punitive house demolitions, the IDF demolishes or seals houses that were home to Palestinian
suicide terrorists or to individuals suspected, detained, or convicted of involvement in violent
acts against Israelis.
Our analysis is based on original micro-level data. We use a longitudinal micro-level data
set containing information on all punitive house demolitions during the second Palestinian
uprising as well as all precautionary house demolitions between 2004 and 2005. For each house
demolished we know the exact location of the house, the timing of the demolition, the house’s
size, and the number of its residents. We link this data set with data on the universe of suicide
terrorists during the same time period, including each terrorist’s timing of the attack and locality

of residence. We augment our data with localities’ specific economic and demographic data, as
well as with longitudinal variation of other counterterrorism measures imposed by the IDF. This
detailed data set allows us to use time and spatial variation to identify and quantify the
effectiveness of house demolitions as a deterrence policy of counterterrorism.
We find that punitive house demolitions lead to fewer suicide attacks in the month
following the demolitions. The effect of house demolition is significant and sizeable—a standard
deviation increase in punitive house demolitions leads to a decrease of 11.7 percent in the
number of suicide terrorists originating from an average district. Intriguingly, we find that in
contrast to the deterrent effect of punitive house demolitions, precautionary demolitions (which
are not related to activities of the houses’ owners and occupants) are associated with more
suicide attacks. In particular, our estimates show that a standard deviation increase in
precautionary house demolitions leads to a 48.7 percent increase in the number of suicide
terrorists from an average district.
Our results are robust to alternative measures of house demolitions, such as the number of
housing units demolished, number of residents affected, and the area size of demolished houses.
The results are also robust to different specifications including a battery of control variables,
counterterrorism measures, and fixed effects. Moreover, we examine the robustness of our
results under alternative counterfactuals, estimate the persistence of the effects, and test whether
these effects change directions over time.
The results indicate that, when targeted correctly, counterterrorism measures such as house
demolitions provide the desired deterrent effect. When used indiscriminately, however, house
demolitions lead to the radicalization of the population and backfire, resulting in more
subsequent attacks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 highlights the institutional details
of house demolitions. Section 3 surveys related literature on counterterrorism policies. Section 4
describes the data and summary statistics. Section 5 presents the empirical analysis, and the last
section concludes.

2. House Demolitions: Background2
The Israel Defense Forces carries out two main types of house demolitions: house
demolitions in “clearing operations” and punitive house demolitions.3
According to official IDF statements, house demolitions in clearing operations are
intended to meet military needs. In particular, such house demolitions are intended to prevent the
launching of attacks from these houses and areas. These demolitions are not related in any way
to activities carried out by the owners or occupants of the houses being demolished. During the
period 2000–2005, clearing operations took place primarily in the Gaza Strip to create “no go
areas.” Houses were demolished mostly along the Egyptian border in the south; around Israeli
settlements, army posts, and roads that were used by settlers and IDF forces throughout Gaza
before the Israeli evacuation of 2005; and in the northern Gaza Strip, in areas from which mortar
rockets (mainly Kassam) have been fired, targeting Israeli communities in southern Israel. We
refer to such demolitions here as “precautionary house demolitions.” We have data on
precautionary house demolitions for the years 2004 and 2005.
The second type of demolition is “punitive house demolitions.” In punitive house
demolitions, the IDF demolishes or seals houses that were home to Palestinians suspected of,
detained in connection with, or convicted of involvement in violent acts against Israelis,
regardless of the results. These acts include suicide bombings that caused many civilian fatalities
as well as thwarted attacks against soldiers or civilians. The demolished houses belong not only
to perpetrators but to individuals accused of involvement in an attack, either by planning it,
dispatching the perpetrators, or providing assistance to the responsible terrorist cell. We have
data on all punitive house demolitions between the years 2000 and 2005.
2.1. The Evolution of House Demolitions: From 1945 to the Second Intifada
The policy of house demolitions in the region began during the British Mandate. In 1945
the acting British high commissioner for Palestine enacted emergency defense regulations that
2

This section draws mostly on Darcy (2003) and Shnayderman (2004).
A third type of demolition is administrative house demolitions of houses built without a building permit.
These demolitions occur almost exclusively in East Jerusalem and are not related to security concerns.
We do not include administrative house demolitions in our analysis because they are not security related,
there is not geographic variation of these demolitions, and there are no good micro-level data on them.

granted authorities the power to conduct searches, make arrests, establish military courts to try
civilians without right of appeal, close off areas, deport individuals, impose curfews, and
demolish houses. In particular, regulation 119(1) allowed the military to seize and destroy
houses, structures, and land as punishment for illegal acts.
The Israeli security forces began conducting punitive house demolitions in 1967, right
after the Six Days’ War, and demolished almost 1,400 houses in the late 1960s. Although the
policy remained in place, punitive house demolitions were rare from the early 1970s until 1987.
With the beginning of the first Intifada in December 1987, the IDF significantly increased the
use of punitive house demolitions to punish and deter further acts of violence, resulting in almost
500 demolitions in the years 1988–1992. There were only a few house demolitions between 1993
and 1997, and the policy was discontinued from 1998 until September 2001.
In response to the wave of violence of the second Intifada that began in October 2000, the
IDF informally renewed punitive house demolitions. The first house demolished during the
second Intifada belonged to a Palestinian suicide bomber who killed 21 Israelis when he blew
himself up in a discotheque in Tel Aviv.4 The political-security cabinet of the Israeli government
officially renewed the policy of punitive demolitions on July 31, 2002, right after a terror attack
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem killed nine Israelis.
The use of house demolitions as a counterterrorism tool has been hotly debated inside and
outside of Israel. Several human rights organizations have repeatedly challenged its legality. In
cases argued before the Israeli Supreme Court of Justice, these organizations have asserted that
the policy of house demolitions constitutes a war crime because it punishes innocent individuals
for acts committed by others (Darcy, 2003).5
In defense of this policy, Israeli officials repeatedly argue that the policy of house
demolitions falls within the exception to article 53 of the fourth Geneva Convention. According
to the IDF, the demolition of houses of terrorists and terror operatives is a crucial
counterterrorism tool for deterring terrorism in general and suicide terrorism in particular. The

These arguments are supported by article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection
of Civilian Persons in Time of War, which states that occupying states are forbidden to destroy property
except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.

Supreme Court of Justice has repeatedly declined to interfere with the IDF’s operational military
considerations (Nabot, 2003).
3. The Effectiveness of Counterterrorism Policies: Related Literature
Although the policy of house demolition has been vigorously debated in political and
legal arenas, there are no systematic studies ascertaining whether house demolitions are effective
in stopping terrorism in general and suicide terrorism in particular (Harel and Isacharoff, 2004).
The Israeli government and the IDF have repeatedly argued before the Supreme Court of Justice
and in the popular press that the policy is effective, although they acknowledge that “it is
impossible to know the exact figures of potential terrorists that have been deterred from
perpetrating attacks by this prevention tactic.”6 In support of the deterrent effect of house
demolitions, government and military officials often cite anecdotal evidence in which relatives of
individuals recruited to commit suicide attacks have contacted the IDF and cooperated with the
military in an attempt to stop the attack and thus save their houses from being demolished (Alon,
2002).
Opponents argue that demolishing houses backfires, since it increases the Palestinians’
hatred of and animosity toward Israel. For example, Shalev’s report of 1991 relies on seven data
points from the first Intifada to argue that, in the aftermath of house demolitions, the number of
violent events against Israelis did not decrease and sometimes even increased.
Evaluating the effectiveness of house demolitions in particular, and counterterrorism in
general, is a challenging empirical task. It is difficult to obtain micro-level data since security
forces are reluctant to release classified counterterrorism information. Even when data are
available, the effect of counterterrorism policies remains unclear because terror organizations
react to the new conditions by choosing different targets and modes of attack.7

There is a growing literature showing that terror groups strategically adapt to counterterror policies. See,
among others, Baliga and Sjöström (2010), Berman (2009), Berman and Laitin (2008), and Enders and
Sandler (1993, 2004). The related theoretical literature on counterterrorism takes terror groups’ strategic
reaction into account for the design of efficient counterterror policies (see, e.g., Bueno de Mesquita
(2007) and Powell (2007a, 2007b)).

4. Data
We use a novel data set on houses demolished between the years 2000 and 2005 as well
as data containing the universe of Palestinians suicide terrorists during the same time period. We
augment these data with information on other counterterrorism measures, as well as economic
and demographic characteristics of Palestinian localities.
Our data on house demolitions were obtained from B’Tselem, a nongovernmental Israeli
human rights organization that monitors and collects data on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Although several studies have used B’Tselem’s data on Israeli and Palestinian fatalities, ours is
the first to use B’Tselem’s detailed micro-data on house demolitions.8
The data include all punitive house demolitions between September 2000 and December
2005 and all precautionary house demolitions for the years 2004 and 2005. For every house
demolition (both punitive and precautionary) we know the date and location of the house
demolished, as well as the number of units in each house, the number of residents in the house,
and the house’s size.
Table 1 depicts the yearly variation of house demolitions during the second Intifada.
Punitive house demolitions vary significantly over time during this period. The IDF renewed the
policy of punitive house demolitions in October 2001, so there were no punitive house
demolitions in 2000 and just six punitive house demolitions in 2001. The number of houses
demolished increases sharply to 235 houses in 2002, the most violent year of the second Intifada.
Whereas the high number of punitive house demolitions remains almost unchanged in 2003,
there is a monotonic decline in the number of punitive house demolitions in the final two years
of the second Intifada.
For each house, we list the number of apartment units, the number of residents, and the
size of the house. Not surprisingly, these related measures of the severity of punitive house
demolitions are highly correlated and show almost the same fluctuation over time. The
correlation between house demolitions and apartment units demolished is 0.99, and the
correlations between house demolitions and the number of residents in the demolished housed
and the size of the houses demolished are 0.72 and 0.88, respectively.
8

For studies that use B’tselem’s data on Israeli and Palestinian fatalities see, among many others, Becker
and Rubinstein (2008), Benmelech et al. (2010), Gould and Klor (2010), Gould and Stecklov (2009), and
Jaeger and Paserman (2006 and 2008).

6

Table 1 also presents the number of precautionary house demolitions in 2004 and 2005.
The table shows a high number of precautionary demolitions in 2004 and a large decline in 2005.
Most of these demolitions occurred in the Gaza Strip (only 25 of the 1,172 occurred in the West
Bank). The large number of demolitions in the Gaza Strip is primarily the result of the IDF’s
attempt to stop the smuggling of weapons and explosives from Egypt to Gaza through tunnels. In
creating a 300-meter buffer zone along the border between Gaza and Egypt, the Israeli army
demolished 619 houses in the southern district of Rafah between March and November 2004
(Human Rights Watch, 2004).
In the bottom panel of Table 1 we present data on suicide terrorists, Israeli fatalities, and
Palestinian fatalities. The data on Palestinian suicide terrorists were constructed by Benmelech
and Berrebi (2007) from reports of the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) and detail the biographies
of all Palestinian suicide terrorists who attacked (or attempted to attack) targets in Israel, the
West Bank, and the Gaza Strip between September 2000 and December 2005. The data contain
information on terrorists’ characteristics, targets’ characteristics, and outcome of the attacks. In
particular, for the 150 suicide terrorists in our data set we know their place of residence and the
date of the attack.
As expected, the number of punitive demolitions is highly correlated with the number of
suicide terrorists. That is, we observe a yearly increase in the number of suicide terrorists up until
2002 and a monotonic decrease after that peak for all subsequent years. We observe similar
patterns of the evolution of violence when we focus on the fluctuations of Israeli and Palestinian
fatalities over time.
The spatial heterogeneity of suicide terrorists and punitive house demolitions is
illustrated in Figure 1. Listed in parentheses are both the number of suicide terrorists who
originated from (first number) and the number of punitive house demolitions carried out in each
of the ten districts in the West Bank, the five districts in the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem
(second number).
There is a high geographic variation with respect to the district of origin of suicide
terrorists and of corresponding house demolitions, especially in the West Bank. Some districts
are violent (Jenin, Nablus, Bethlehem, and Hebron), with a high number of suicide terrorists and
punitive house demolitions, while other districts are fairly calm (Tubas, Jericho, and Salfit).

7

Districts in the Gaza Strip are more homogenous than those in the West Bank in terms of the
number of both suicide terrorists and punitive house demolitions.
Table 2 refines the geographical description of Figure 1 by reporting summary statistics
on the number of suicide terrorists originating from a locality, the number of Israeli-induced
Palestinian fatalities, and the number of house demolitions for each locality in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.9
Violence varied substantially across localities. The average number of suicide terrorists
originating from a locality is 0.218. Forty-three of the 683 localities had at least one suicide
terrorist, and the maximum number of suicide terrorists originating from a locality (Nablus) is
30. The average number of Israeli-induced Palestinian fatalities is 4.9, and the maximum is 490
(Ashati Refugee camp in the Gaza district). There are 0.9 punitive house demolitions in the
average locality affecting 5.96 residents.
Table 3 restricts the sample to the 43 localities from which at least one suicide terrorist
originated. The average number of suicide terrorists per locality in this subsample is 3.5, and the
median is 2. There were on average 63.5 Israeli-induced Palestinian fatalities in these localities.
The average number of punitive house demolitions is 10.63, and the average number of
precautionary house demolitions is 25.58. Likewise, about 70 local residents were directly
affected by punitive demolitions within a locality, and on average 239.5 residents were directly
affected by precautionary demolitions during the period at issue.
In our empirical estimation we augment the data on suicide bombers and house
demolitions with economic and demographic variables from the Palestinian Labor Force Survey
(PLFS) of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.10 Table 4 displays summary statistics of the economic
and demographic variables of interest for all districts and provides a general overview of
Palestinian economic and demographic conditions during second Intifada. We observe a

We classify localities using the 1997 Palestinian Census. Accordingly, there are 683 localities in East
Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip.
10
This survey, administered by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), covers a
representative sample of the Palestinian population. The survey has been conducted every quarter since
1995 and provides information on a sample of about 22,000 individuals aged 15 and above residing in
East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Since our empirical analysis focuses on the second
Intifada, we use data from all quarterly surveys between the years 2000 and 2005, with a total of more
than 500,000 individual-quarter observations. We use these micro-level data to calculate economic and
demographic variables at the district level.

relatively young population with low average years of schooling and a low unemployment rate
due largely to extremely low labor force participation.
In the bottom row of Table 4 we report summary statistics on the number of curfews days
per district per quarter. The data on curfews was obtained from the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).11 OCHA provided data on total hours under
curfew by district by month between May 2002 and December 2005. Over this period, the
average number of curfew days in a month within a district was 1.341, and the maximum was 4.6
days (in Hebron).
5. The Effect of House Demolitions on the Number of Suicide Attacks
5.1 Empirical Framework
To test the relationship between house demolitions and the number of suicide terrorists
we focus on district-month cells (or localities-month cells). Our baseline regressions identify the
effect of house demolitions within a district on future suicide attacks originating from that
district. Given that the number of attacks originated from a district at a particular month is a nonnegative integer, we estimate Poisson regression models.
Formally, we estimate different variants of the following baseline specification:
E [suicide terroristsi,t | xi,t–1] = exp (HDi,t–1β1 + xi,t–1β2 + λi + γt)

(1)

where suicide terroristsi,t is the number of suicide terrorists that originate from district i in month
t; HDi,t–1 is the number of punitive house demolitions in district i in month t–1; and xi,t–1
represents the other explanatory variables in the model that are used to control for potentially
confounding factors. These include Israeli-induced Palestinian fatalities, demographic and
economic characteristics, and Israeli security measures that vary across districts and time, all of
which are listed in Table 4. λi is a district fixed effect that controls for districts’ unobservable
characteristics that are time-invariant; γt is a year fixed effect that absorbs common fluctuations
of violence over time. Hence, by including fixed effects for each district and year, we essentially
examine whether variation over time in punitive house demolitions within a district is correlated
with variation over time within a district of suicide terror attacks, while controlling for the

its responsibilities, the OCHA office in the West Bank and Gaza Strip monitors closures and curfews
imposed on the Palestinian population.

common trend in violence across districts and a rich set of districts’ characteristics. In some of
the specifications in the tables below we include district-specific time trends, thus showing that
the results are robust to an alternative identifying assumption. Last, in all specifications we
cluster the error term at the district level to capture nonsystematic determinants of the number of
suicide terrorists.
5.2 Main Results
We present the results from estimating the impact of punitive house demolitions on the
number of suicide terrorists from the same district in subsequent months in Table 5. We estimate
a panel Poisson model controlling—depending on the specification—for district fixed effects,
year fixed effects, district-specific linear time trends, and districts’ economic and demographic
characteristics (unemployment, percentage employed in Israel, average years of schooling,
average age, and fraction of males and married individuals in the district’s population). In some
specifications we also control for other security-related measures (in addition to house
demolitions) for which data are available: (1) the number of Israeli-induced Palestinian fatalities,
and (2) the number of days with a curfew.12
The effect of punitive house demolitions on the number of suicide terrorists is not
statistically significant when we only control separately for either district or year fixed effects
(Columns 1–3). In fact, without controlling for district fixed effects, we observe a positive
correlation between punitive house demolitions and number of suicide terrorists. This result is
likely to be caused by an omitted variable bias, since more violent districts obviously have more
punitive house demolitions and a higher number of suicide terrorists. Nonetheless, a naive
interpretation of this positive correlation is sometimes being used in public discourse as proof
that house demolitions backfire.
When we control for district fixed effects (to account for unobserved underlying
heterogeneity across districts) and year fixed effects (to account for common fluctuations over
time of the variables of interest), we see that punitive house demolitions in a given district
significantly decrease the number of suicide terrorists who originate from that district. This effect
12

The inclusion of days with a curfew into the model considerably lowers the number of observations
from 1,008 district-month observations to 704 because this variable is available only from May 2002
onward.

10

is not only statistically significant but of an important magnitude. In particular, the estimated rate
ratio implies that the marginal punitive house demolition lowers the number of suicide terrorists
originating from a district in the following month by a factor of 0.941. This effect implies that a
standard deviation increase in the number of punitive house demolitions (which is equal to 2.04)
causes a decrease of 11.7 percent in the number of suicide terrorists originating from an average
district-month cell.
The negative effect of punitive house demolitions on the number of subsequent suicide
terrorists is qualitatively and quantitatively robust to the inclusion of additional controls, such as
demographic and economic characteristics (Column 5), as well as other proxies for the security
situation at the district level (Column 7). Moreover, when we include district-specific time
trends, the result (Column 6) is also robust to different identifying assumptions that are based on
deviations of house demolitions and the number of suicide terrorists from districts’ specific
trends (and not only the districts’ averages, as in the other columns).
In Table 6 we repeat the same specifications of Columns 4 to 7 in Table 5 but focus on
the other available measures for the severity of house demolitions. The results confirm that the
main conclusions from Table 5 are robust to different measures of house demolitions and across
different specifications. That is, punitive house demolitions have a significant deterrent effect on
suicide terrorism regardless of whether we focus on the number of apartment units, the number
of residents, or the size of the houses being demolished. The point estimates for each measure are
not affected by the additions of demographic and economic controls or other measures of
counterterrorism. The estimates are also robust to the inclusion of district-specific time trends.
We analyze the data using both district-month and locality-month aggregations. Tables 7
and 8 repeat the regressions in Tables 5 and 6, respectively, focusing on locality-month cells
instead of district-month cells. That is, Tables 7 and 8 are based on more refined micro-level
data. The data set that focuses on localities is more detailed and hence the estimation is more
precise than when using district-level data. Once we introduce locality fixed effects, however,
the estimates rely only on the 43 localities in which least one suicide terrorist originated (out of
683 localities). Hence, by comparing the results from both district-month and locality-month
aggregations, we make sure that the results are not unduly affected by the elimination from the
sample of localities in which suicide attacks did not originate.

11

We see a similar pattern in Tables 7 and 8 to the one found using data at the district level.
That is, punitive house demolitions are shown to have a significant deterrent effect on suicide
terrorists also when using data at the locality level. Remarkably, even the point estimates are of
almost the same magnitude as those in Tables 5 and 6. While measured at the locality level, a
one standard deviation increase in punitive house demolitions causes a decrease of 14.9 percent
on the odds of that a suicide terrorist originated from that locality within a month of the
demolitions. This effect is higher than the one observed when data is aggregated at the district
level (11.7 percent). As we show in subsection 5.4 below, the difference is explained by the
spatial dissipation of the deterrent effect of punitive house demolitions.
In sum, we observe that punitive house demolitions have an immediate deterrent effect on
suicide terrorism. This effect is robust to different specifications and for different measures of
punitive house demolitions. In additional analysis presented in the Appendix we show that the
effects of punitive house demolitions are qualitatively and quantitatively the same if we use a
Negative Binomial model instead of a Poisson model (Table A.1). The deterrent effect of house
demolitions on suicide terrorism is even larger when we eliminate from the sample the first year
of the second Intifada, in which the IDF did not conduct punitive house demolitions (see Table
A.2).
5.3 Dynamic Effects of Punitive House Demolitions
The previous section established that punitive house demolitions led to an immediate
decline in suicide terrorism—within one month after the demolition. This section examines the
persistency of the deterrent effect of house demolitions. We study the persistency of house
demolitions over six months using a series of six Poisson regressions. That is, for each of the
four available measures for house demolitions we use the specification in Column 5 of Table 5,
except that each regression uses a different lag of house demolitions, which varies from one to
six months. Figure 2 presents the estimated coefficients as well as 90 percent confidence bands.
The figure shows that the effect of punitive house demolitions, though significant a
month after their occurrence, fades away over time. That is, the pattern of coefficients
consistently shows for the four measures a negative and significant effect of house demolitions
within a one-month lag and an almost monotonic convergence to zero for higher-order lags. Note
also that the effect of punitive house demolitions is not statistically different from zero from a lag
12

of two months and onward, indicating that the deterrent effect of house demolitions basically
disappears after one month of their occurrence.13
One concern that arises from the findings in Figure 2 is that the short-lived effect of
house demolitions is in fact caused by other counterterrorism measures that the IDF imposes on
the terrorists’ localities of origin after suicide attacks. For example, after a suicide attack the IDF
may choose not only to demolish the house of the perpetrator but also to impose curfews,
closures, and roadblocks while also increasing military presence in the area. Although we are
able to control for curfews and Israeli-induced Palestinian fatalities, we do not have information
on all other possible counterterrorism measures.
The analysis in Table 9 directly addresses the concern that confounding factors prevalent
in the aftermath of a terror attack are behind the observed impact of punitive house demolitions
on suicide terrorism. In this analysis, we eliminate from the data set all locality-month cells in
which the IDF demolishes a house within a month of a suicide attack in direct retaliation for the
attack.14
The results of this analysis show that the significant negative effect of house demolitions
on the number of suicide terrorists is not caused exclusively by immediate house demolitions
after a terror attack. The estimated coefficients are statistically significant and only slightly lower
in magnitude when compared to the coefficients estimated using the universe of suicide terrorists
(Tables 7 and 8).
An alternative concern is that strategic considerations of terror cells may cause a decrease
in suicide terrorism after a suicide attack. For example, the dynamics of suicide terrorism may be
such that a terror cell imposes a period of relative calm, a strategy of “laying low,” after a
successful terror attack. Table 10 adds to the regressions the number of contemporaneous suicide
attacks as an additional control variable to address this issue directly.
The results show that recent suicide terror attacks do not systematically affect future
attacks. The coefficients on contemporaneous suicide attacks are not consistently significant
across different specifications, and they even change sign when we control for other measures of
13

This is consistent with the results of Jaeger et al. (2008). They found that Israeli-induced Palestinian
fatalities radicalize the preferences of the Palestinian population within one month of their occurrence but
that the effect dissipates within three months.
14
This occurred after 20 suicide attacks, with 17 cases in which the suicide terrorist’s house was
demolished within four days of the attack.

13

counterterrorism. Importantly, however, the coefficients on house demolitions remain highly
statistically significant and of the same magnitude as those estimated in Tables 5 and 6. Hence,
the message that emerges from Tables 9 and 10 and Figure 2 is that punitive house demolitions
have a significant, albeit short-lived, negative impact on the number of suicide terrorists.
5.4 Geographic Effects of Punitive House Demolitions
In this section we analyze the geographic dispersion of the effect of punitive house
demolitions on suicide terrorism. To that end, we study whether house demolitions in a
neighboring district have an effect on local suicide terrorism. That is, we add to the
specifications in Columns 6 and 7 of Table 5 an additional covariate with the number of punitive
house demolitions in the rest of the districts in the same region.15
We find that the effects of house demolitions dissipate not only over time but also across
geographic distance (Table 11). Accordingly, the effects of local punitive house demolitions on
the number of local suicide terrorists are still negative and statistically significant. However,
punitive house demolitions in other districts in the same region do not have a significant impact
on the number of suicide terrorists.
5.5 The Effects of Precautionary House Demolitions
Here we study the effects of precautionary house demolitions on suicide terrorism. As
mentioned in section 2, precautionary house demolitions refer to houses demolished in “clearing
operations” intended to meet military needs. For houses demolished for punitive reasons, the IDF
directly links the owner and/or occupant of the house to terror activity against Israel. That is,
there is a direct link between an individual’s action and the resulting punishment. In contrast, for
houses demolished for precautionary reasons, the IDF does not claim an existing connection
between the house occupant and terror activity. Hence, there is no connection between the
individual’s actions and the resulting demolition of the house. In fact, the main determinant of
precautionary house demolitions is whether the house is located near the Egyptian or Israeli
borders or surrounding an Israeli settlement or roads used by settlers. Following Kalyvas’s
15

We use the standard division of the 16 districts under the Palestinian Authority into West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Accordingly, there are 11 districts in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and 5 districts
in the Gaza Strip (see Figure 1).

14

(2006) classification of types of violence, we view punitive house demolitions as a form of
selective violence and precautionary house demolitions as a form of indiscriminate violence.
We test the effectiveness of precautionary house demolitions in Table 12. The models
estimated include, in addition to precautionary house demolitions, the same controls used in
Column 7 in Table 5.16 The table shows results with the data aggregated at the district and at the
locality level. In addition, we present results both for the entire sample and excluding Rafah from
the sample since Rafah is a clear outlier during this period.17
Interestingly, the results show that precautionary demolitions have a positive effect on the
number of suicide terrorists. The estimated coefficients are statistically significant (when
excluding Rafah from the sample) and of an important magnitude. The estimated rate ratio
implies that the marginal precautionary house demolition increases the number of suicide
terrorists originating from a district in the following month by a factor of 1.051. This effect
implies that a standard deviation increase in the number of precautionary house demolitions
(which is equal to 7.99) causes an increase of 48.7 percent on the number of suicide terrorists
originating from an average district-month cell.
These results provide strong support to the hypothesis that indiscriminate violence is
counterproductive because it creates new grievances.18 As argued by Rosendorff and Sandler
(2004) and Bueno de Mesquita and Dickson (2007) in related studies of terrorism, and by
Kalyvas (2006) in his comprehensive study on the use of violence in civil wars, indiscriminate
violence against civilians increases popular support for terrorist and insurgent groups. Terrorists
and insurgents usually translate this increase into bigger cadres and increased violence against
their political opponents.

16

Given that the data on precautionary house demolitions are available only for the years 2004 and 2005,
we do not have enough within-district or within-locality variation for this type of demolition.
Consequently, the regressions do not converge when we include district- or locality-specific linear time
trends.
17
See related discussion in section 3.
18
See Condra and Shapiro (2010) for additional empirical support to this result based on an analysis of
violence in Iraq between 2004 and 2008. Note, however, that Lyall (2009) finds that the use of
indiscriminate violence in Chechnya by the Russian army caused a significant decrease in insurgents’
attacks.

15

6. Conclusions
This paper presents the first systematic examination of the effectiveness of house
demolitions using a novel micro-level data set. Our analysis shows that punitive house
demolitions, a selective policy of counterterrorism, lead to an immediate decrease in the number
of suicide terrorists. This effect dissipates over time and space. In contrast to punitive house
demolitions, precautionary house demolitions, which can be likened to an indiscriminate policy
of counterterrorism, lead to a significance increase in the number of suicide terror attacks against
Israeli citizens.
While we find that punitive house demolitions are an effective tool to deter suicide
terrorism, it may not be an efficient policy because it may cause some undesirable consequences.
For example, punitive house demolitions may lead to an increase in other types of terror attacks
or bring about animosity from the international community against Israel. That said, by showing
which types of demolitions deter terrorists and which promote more terrorism, we shed more
light on the desirability of house demolitions and their effectiveness as a counter-suicideterrorism tool.
