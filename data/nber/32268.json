    "abstract": "\n\nWe analytically characterize asset-pricing and consumption behavior in two-account heterogeneous-agent models with aggregate risk. We show that trading frictions can simultaneously explain (1) household-level consumption behavior such as high marginal propensities to consume, (2) a zero-beta rate on equities that satisfies an aggregate consumption Euler equation, (3) a return on safe assets that does not, and (4) a flat securities market line. The return of equities is well explained by aggregate consumption, while the return of safe assets reflects a large and volatile liquidity premium.\n\n",
