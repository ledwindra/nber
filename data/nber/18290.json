    "abstract": "\n\nWhat can history tell us about the relationship between the banking system, financial crises, the global economy, and economic performance? Evidence shows that in the advanced economies we live in a world that is more financialized than ever before as measured by importance of credit in the economy. I term this long---run evolution \"The Great Leveraging\" and present a ten\u2010point examination of its main contours and implications.\n\n",
