On the Interpretation of Near Random Walk Behavior in GNP

ABSTRACT

It

is shown that GNP will have an autoregressive root very close to unity
in a variant of Taylor's (1980a,b) overlapping wage contracts model, for
stylized versions of simple money supply rules and plausible values for the
model's parameters. In this variant, monetary policy is the only reason for
serial correlation in GNP. It is premature, therefore, to conclude, as some
authors, have, that the presence of such a root in U.S. GNP is inconsistent
with either a stationary natural rate or with nominal shocks playing a major
role in the business cycle.

Several recent papers have studied the univariate time series process for
U. S. GNP, including Campbell and Mankiw (1986), Clark (1986a,b), Cochrane
(1986), Nelson and Plosser (1982), Quah (1986), Stock and Watson (1986) and

Watson (1986). A major focus of these papers has been the extent to which GNP
movements are well approximated by a process with a unit root with drift, as

opposed to stationary movements around a time trend. The empirical evidence
on this is mixed. Campbell and Mankiw (1986), Nelson and Plosser (1982), and
Stock and Watson (1986) conclude that the random walk (unit root)
approximation is quite good, Clark (1986a,b), Cochrane (1986) and, perhaps,
Quah (1986) and Watson (1986) that it is not.

Campbell and Mankiw (1986) and Nelson and Plosser (1982) both argue that
if the random walk approximation in fact is reasonable, there are important

implications for business cycle theory. This is because movements in random

walks are permanent: a shock today has an infinitely long lived effect. The
concept of a stationary natural rate, Campbell and Mankiw note, has little
utility if a GNP shock is, on average, never offset by a return to some trend

rate of GNP. Nelson and Plosser suggest that monetary disturbances are
unlikely to be an important source of GNP fluctuations, since monetary shocks

are typically thought to have no permanent effect. Both conclude that if the
random walk characterization is accurate, an implication is that fluctuations

in GNP are unlikely to be driven by nominal demand shocks) Similar
inferences appear to be drawn by Stultz and Wasserfallen (1985), Deaton (1986)
and Blanchard and Quah (1987).

Campbell and Mankiw (1986) and Nelson and Plosser (1982) of course
recognize that their random walk characterization is only a convenient

approximation. In any finite sample, it will not be possible to discriminate

2
between a unit root (random walk) and an root arbitrarily near, but below,

unity (what this paper calls a "near random walk't). This is potentially a

practical problem. The Monte Carlo evidence in Dickey and Fuller (1981)
indicates that with Nelson and Plosser's (1982) sample size (less than 100),

Nelson and Plosser's test of a unit root null is not very likely to reject
even when the true process is stationary, with autoregressive coefficients

whose sum is as low as .8. Coefficients of this size and larger are suggested
by studies that assume the GNP process is stationary. An AR(2) of log real
GNP around trend fitted to annual U.S. data 1948-1985, for example, yields
coefficients whose sum is .83; since the estimate of this sum is sharply
downward biased for processes with near unit roots (Fuller (1976)), the .83
point estimate is suggestive of a sum even closer to unity.2

The aims of this paper are twofold. The first is to point out that it is
dangerous to use a single country's univariate GNP process to draw structural
inferences concerning the stability of the natural rate, or of the importance
of nominal shocks in business cycles, given that in practice one cannot

discriminate between random walk and near random walk behavior. The second is
to emphasize that simple natural rate models with nominal shocks are as
capable as simple real business cycle models (e.g., King et al. (1987)) in
generating a highly persistent process for GNP.

The paper uses a variant of Taylor's (l980a,b) overlapping wage contracts
model, which maintains a stationary natural rate.3 In my variant (unlike
Taylor's) the only source of instability--the only reason GNP ever deviates

from the natural rate--is shocks to monetary policy. Thus, monetary policy is
the only important factor in the business cycle. It is shown that near random
walk behavior in GNP can result from monetary policy of the sort often

3
attributed to the U. S. Federal Reserve.

The basic idea is as follows. In practically any model, including
Taylor's, serial correlation in movements of the money stock puts serial

correlation in movements in prices. In Taylor's model, prices do not adjust
instantaneously to movements in money. Additional persistence in prices is
induced by the overlapping wage contracts. Movements in real interest rates
and real balances therefore are serially correlated, and this induces serial
correlation in aggregate demand and GNP.

The degree of the serial correlation

depends on the monetary authority's money supply rule and the model's basic

parameters. Stylized versions of simple money supply rules, and plausible
values for the model's basic parameters, suggest near random walk behavior in

GNP. The implied autoregressive root is about .8 to .99.
Near random walk behavior, then, is perfectly consistent with Taylor's

natural rate model. This is, of course, implicitly a message in Taylor
(1980a,b), since it is argued there that, at least in the presence of supply

shocks, the model is capable of tracking observed movements in GNP. The

present paper generalizes Taylor's result in two ways. First, I show that
near random walk behavior results even in a model with purely nominal shocks.
In light of Campbell and Mankiw's (1986) and Nelson and Plosser's (1982)

interpretation of their results, this seems important to establish. Second, I
show that near random walk behavior results even in a version of Taylor's

model extended to include standard IS and LM curves, with a monetary policy

rule of targeting the interest rate. Given the widespread use of such an
aggregate demand apparatus (at least in textbooks), this seems to be an useful
generalization.

Before deriving my results, let me emphasize what I am not arguing. I am

4

not arguing that destablizing monetary policy is the sole, or even most

important, source of U. S. GNP's near random walk behavior. I am suppressing
the supply and demand shocks present in Taylor (1980a,b) not because I doubt
their importance, but to make my point as cleanly and emphatically as

possible. I am also not arguing that the unit root approximation is a bad
one. It is probably appropriate for forming simple ARIMA forecasts (McCallum
(1986a)), for example. It may even be appropriate for structural estimation
and inference: I am not arguing for a stationary monetary theory of the

business cycle against, say, a nonstationary real theory. My point, rather,
is that the stylized facts about GNP are perfectly consistent with Taylor's

widely used model. Simple analysis of a given country's univariate process
for GNP therefore is unlikely to be particularly helpful in distinguishing
stationary from nonstationary theories, nor between models in which nominal

shocks are very important from those in which they have negligible effects.

I. Near Random Walk for GNP

The aggregate supply curve (Phillips curve) is borrowed from Taylor
(1980a,b). There are staggered two period wage contracts. In each period,
one half of the labor force fixes its nominal wage for the next two periods.

The variables are: x =

log GNP, i =

5

nominal interest rate, Pt =

log price level, m = log money supply, u a

serially uncorrelated shock. A "t-l" subscript, as a prefix, denotes
expectations at time t-l. All variables are zero mean deviations from trend.
Trend GNP is by definition potential or natural rate GNP.

Equation (1) says that the nominal wage depends on actual and expected

wages, as well as expected demand pressure. The latter is measured by
expected deviations of GNP from trend. Equation (2) is a price markup
equation. Equation (3) is a standard IS curve, relating GNP to the ex-ante
real interest rate. Equation (4) is a standard LM curve, expressing the
demand for money as a function of the nominal interest rate and GNP. As noted
in the introduction, the supply and demand shocks that quite plausibly are
present in equations (1) to (4) are suppressed, to emphasize the potential
role for monetary policy in output fluctuations.

Equation (5) is the money supply rule, with OX<l and u a serially
uncorrelated shock. The monetary authority is thus assumed to smooth

movements in interest rates. Empirical evidence that i followed a near
random walk in the post war period (A is near one) may be found in Fama and

Gibbons (1982). A theoretical argument why the Fed might have set nominal
interest rates to follow a near random walk may be found in Mankiw (1986).

It is straightforward, though tedious, to solve the model.4

To see how the properties of (8), the univariate process

depend on

the monetary policy rule (depend on X), consider two cases. The first is A0,

Since X0 implies b0 (see equation (6)), we have from (8) that

(9)

=

_ut.

So if the monetary authority takes care that the current nominal interest rate
is independent of past shocks, deviations of output from the natural rate are
serially uncorrelated.

Consider instead the case when A is near unity. From (6), as

b-->-. It follows that for A arbitrarily near one, d1 (defined in (8)) will
be arbitrarily near zero and d2 arbitrarily near -1. Thus for A very near 1,
ii(L) will factor as (-6+.5b6)(1+r,1L)(l-TI2L), i1l,

Since the

l-ii2L factor approximately cancels the 1-AL autoregressive factor,

are cancelled,5

7

It follows that

will behave much like a variable with a unit root if

is

near one.

We have a-->l as Z5-->0, i.e., as the aggregate supply and/or IS curves

become horizontal. Taylor (1980b) estimated Z to be about .05 to .10.
Sachs's (1980) Phillips curve regressions suggest that

is about .01 to .07.6

Friedman's (1977) estimates suggest &.l7; Taylor (1985) indicates that 5 is
less than .125. If we take .01 to .10 as the range for Z, .1 to .2 as the

range for 6, then 8 is about .001 to .02. This yields a range for

of about

.96 to .998. See Table lA. Plausible parameter values therefore suggest that
the near random walk characterization will be quite good if the monetary
authority attempts to stabilize interest rates by setting

zero for X near one. With

t i(i_Xii)

to

this near unity, it will be difficult to reject

the null hypothesis of a unit root, in sample sizes typically available.8
The intuition to the effect of X on the univariate

process is as

follows. With X0, the contract wage and price level are nonstochastic:
is the only stationary (constant mean) solution to (7) with b0. So

the IS curve (3) implies 5' and, with X0, i is serially uncorrelated.
By contrast, when X0, the autoregressive root of l-XL in the monetary
authority's control variable puts the same root in the wage and price
processes; the long run properties of the money supply rule of course are

reflected in wages and prices. But that is not all. As Taylor (1980a) has
emphasized, overlapping contracts can be an endogenous source of persistence.

The serial correlation in the money supply induces serial correlation in wages

and prices above and beyond that directly produced by the l-XL root. So

expected inflation, tt÷lt' does not move instantaneously, and one to one,

8

The real interest rate is serially correlated, and, therefore, as

with

per the IS curve (3), so is GNP.

More generally, for any A between 0 and 1, there will also be persistence

in GNP. If A is near zero, y will behave much like the serially uncorrelated
variable defined in (9). The closer is A to unity, the more will y behave
like the serially correlated process defined in (10).

It is worth noting that a similar result obtains if, as in Taylor
(1980a,b) the money supply rule involves targeting the money supply instead of

the interest rate. To analyze this type of rule, it is convenient to follow
Taylor and replace the IS and LM curves with a simple quantity equation,

Pt =

(11)

Unlike

Taylor, I have set to zero shocks to velocity (deviations of velocity

from trend), as explained in the introduction. Also, replace the interest
rate target (5) with a money supply target,

(12)

m =

+ A(m.1-gp_1) + Ut.

where u. is a serially uncorrelated shock and
To understand (12), consider first the case when A, u.

0. Then, as in

Taylor (l980a), the parameter g measures how accommodative monetary policy is.

(For my purposes one could have the monetary authority look directly at y as
well as [or instead of I

only Pt appears in the money supply rule for

consistency with Taylor (1980a,b).) The shock u. is not present in Taylor
(1980a,b). It is intended to reflect shocks to the money supply resulting

from, say, random movements in the money multiplier. The A(m_1-p..1) term
is present to capture a tendency of the monetary authority to absorb previous

9

control errors. If X=1, previous Ut's are never offset and are carried
through to all future money supplies. Such random walk behavior ("base
drift") has been argued to characterize Federal Reserve policy in the U.S., at
least in recent years (see Walsh (1986) and the references cited therein).

The model may be solved as in Taylor (l980a,b); the details are omitted

to save space. Let =

is about .003 to .03, yielding an implied

of .78 to .93. See Table lB.
The intuition to the effect of A on the univariate y process is similar

to that for the previous money supply rule. With A0, the contract wage and

price level are nonstochastic: xx_1O is the only stationary solution to
(13) with b0. So the aggregate demand equation (11) implies

and, with

X0, m is serially uncorrelated. By contrast, when X1, the unit root in the
money supply first of all puts a unit root in wages and prices; the long run

10

properties of wages and prices are governed by the money supply. But because
of the staggered contracts, real balances, the difference between m and p,

have additional persistence: prices do not move instantaneously, and one for

one, with money supplies. This persistence is transmitted directly into GNP
by the aggregate demand equation (11).

II. Conclusions

Neither stationarity of the natural rate, nor nominal shocks playing an
important role in the business cycle, are inconsistent with a root very near

to unity being present in the GNP process. In Taylor's (1980a,b) stationary
natural rate model, extreme persistence in GNP movements is precisely what is
predicted, given stylized versions of money supply rules often attributed to

the Fed, and plausible values for the model's basic parameters. The model
also predicts that different money supply rules would result in dramatically
less persistent movements in GNP.

This is not to argue that, in fact, the business cycle in the U.S. is
purely, or even largely, monetary in origin, nor that natural rate theory is

to be preferred to non-natural rate theory. Rather, detailed study of the
univariate process for a single country's GNP is unlikely to be particularly

helpful in deciding some important business cycle issues. Potentially more
helpful are comparative studies of GNP processes across various countries and

various time periods. The evidence here is mixed. Stultz and Wasserfallen
(1985) and Campbell and Mankiw (1987) conclude that during the post War period
the random walk approximation is reasonable for a number of industrialized

countries. This perhaps makes it less likely that GNP behavior could change
dramatically with a change in policy regime. On the other hand, Stock and
Watson (1986) find that for the U.S., the random walk approximation is

11

reasonable only in the post-1919 period. This is consistent with the present

paper's model: the near random walk behavior of the nominal interest rate
appears to have begun around 1915-1920 (Mankiw, Niron and Well (1987)), and

inflation appears to have been more sensitive to excess demand pre-1929 than

post-War (Sachs (198O)). In any case, estimation of multivariate structural
models is, of course, potentially still more helpful than is estimation of
univariate time series.

Footnotes

1. Nelson and Plosser (1982, p166) conclude that "assigning a major portion of
variance in output to the innovation in [a] nonstationary component gives an
important role for real factors in output fluctuations and places limits on

the importance of monetary theories of the business cycle." Campbell and
Mankiw (1986, p24) state that their results are "inconsistent with many
prominent theories in which output fluctuations are primarily caused by shocks
to aggregate demand ...

[including]

models based on long-term nominal

contracts."
2. Throughout, I assume annual rather than quarterly data, for two reasons.

The first is for consistency with some of the relevant studies, including

Taylor (1980b) and Nelson and Plosser (1982). The second is that the two
period contract length that, for simplicity, will be assumed in section I

below, is implausibly short for quarterly but not for annual data. In
addition, and again for consistency, all empirical estimates are taken from
studies using post World War II U. S. data.

3. I follow Taylor (1980a, 1980b) in interpreting his model as a natural rate

one. McCallum (undated, 1987) argues otherwise.
4. The well known

indeterminacy

of rational expectations models under interest

rate rules (Sargent (1979), McCallum (1986b)) applies here as well. The rule
(5) is interpreted as in McCallum (1986b) as the limit of a certain

non-interest rate rule that yields a unique stationary solution for y. The
restriction Xl is imposed because for X1 this solution technique breaks down
(a divide by zero is implied). See the formula for

in equation (6) below.

5. This illustrates the possibility that approximate cancellation of common
autoregressive and moving average factors may help explain Rose's (1987)
result that univariate time series have simpler ARMA representations than are

13

suggested by multiequation structural models. See Rose (1987, pp27-29).

6. Rewrite (1) as x-x_1 =

t_i(xt÷it)

+

+ e, a 2, e

This is in the usual Phillips curve form,
inflation = expected inflation + a*excess demand + shock.

The .01 to .07

range reported in the text is one half of Sachs's (1980) estimates of a (i.e.,

one half of his post-War estimates of the coefficients that he calls

and

in his Tables 3 and 4).

7. This is Friedman's (1977, p322) implied estimate of the long-run elasticity
of real spending with respect to the nominal interest rate, from regressions

using quarterly data. (The short run [single quarterj elasticity is .09.)
Friedman (1977, p323) notes that in his 1961-1976 sample period, nominal and
expected real yields are likely to be very highly correlated, which suggests
that his estimates are appropriate for an IS curve that depends on the
expected real rate.

8. To make the argument in the preceding two paragraphs concrete, it may help
to calculate ye's ARMA parameters for specific X and a.

Suppose that a=.96,

X.96. (The value for X is Fama and Gibbons's (1982, Table 2) point estimate
of the first order serial correlation coefficient of monthly T-bill rates,
1953-1977; Fama and Gibbons do not report figures for annual interest rates.)
Then one can grind through the formulas in the text to show that ye's moving

average polynomial factors as (1+.32L)(l-.98L). Output will therefore behave
much like an ARMA(1,1) variable with a single autoregressive unit root of .96.
9. Stock and Watson (1986) suggest that the seeming stationarity of pre-1919
GNP may instead be an artifact of the way these data were constructed.

Appendix
As stated in footnote 4, the money supply rule (5) is understood to be

the limit of a certain non-interest rate rule. This rule is a simple
generalization of the rule in Driskell and Sheffrin (1986) and DeLong and
Summers (1986):

m =

The rule (Al) yields a unique stationary solution for

the solution for y under the rule (5) is understood to be the one that
results when one first solves using a finite a and then takes the limit as
