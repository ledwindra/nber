    "abstract": "\n\nNot only are investors biased toward home assets, but when they do invest abroad, they appear to favor countries with returns more correlated with home assets. Often attributed to a preference for familiarity, this \u2018correlation puzzle\u2019 further reduces effective diversification. However, a multi-country DSGE model of portfolio choice makes clear that the effects of a bilateral stock return correlation must be studied in the context of the full covariance structure. For example, the attractiveness of a foreign country as a hedge depends upon its hedging potential relative to other potential destination countries. This paper develops a new empirical approach based upon a multi-country theoretical model that controls for the full covariance structure in a theoretically rigorous yet tractable manner. Estimation under this approach overturns the correlation puzzle, and finds that international investors do seek the diversification benefits of low cross-country correlations as theory would predict. Since covariances are central to modern theories of portfolio choice, this empirical methodology should be useful also for other applications.\n\n",
