Rent Rigidity, Asymmetric Information, and Volatility Bounds in Labor Markets

NBER Working Paper No. 13030

JEL No. E24,E32
ABSTRACT
Recent findings have revived interest in the link between real wage rigidity and employment fluctuations,
in the context of frictional labor markets. The standard search and matching model fails to generate
substantial labor market fluctuations if wages are set by Nash bargaining, while it can generate fluctuations
in excess of what is observed if wages are completely rigid. This suggests that less severe rigidity
may suffice. We study a weaker notion of real rigidity, which arises only in frictional labor markets,
where the wage is the sum of the worker's opportunity cost (the value of unemployment) and a rent.
With wage rigidity this sum is acyclical; we consider rent rigidity, where only the rent is acyclical.
We offer two contributions. First, we derive upper bounds on labor market volatility that apply if the
model of wage determination generates weakly procyclical worker rents, and that are attained by rent
rigidity. Quantitatively, the bounds are tight: rent rigidity generates no more than a third of observed
volatility, an outcome that is closer to Nash bargaining than to wage rigidity. Second, we show that
the bounds apply to a sequence of famous solutions to the bargaining problem under asymmetric
information: at best they generate rigid rents but not rigid wages.

Introduction

The role of real wage rigidity in shaping employment fluctuations is a perennial subject of
macroeconomics. Interest in this subject has recently been revived by the finding that a
conventional calibration of the baseline textbook search and matching model driven by labor
productivity shocks of plausible magnitude and persistence grossly fails to account for the
observed volatility of unemployment and vacancies (Shimer, 2005; Hall, 2005; Costain and
Reiter, 2005). If the standard assumption of Nash-bargained wages is replaced by a rigid
wage, however, then the model is capable of generating fluctuations in excess of what is
observed (Hall, 2005). Thus in principle other models of wage determination may be able
to match observed volatility by generating wages which are not completely yet sufficiently
rigid. Specifically, Shimer (2005) asks whether bargaining under asymmetric information may
enhance amplification. What characteristics must a model of wage determination have in
order to match observed volatility?
In this paper we study a notion of rigidity weaker than wage rigidity. It arises naturally in
frictional labor markets, where the compensation of the worker is the sum of his opportunity
cost (the value of unemployed job search), and a quasi-rent that accrues when he finds a job.
With wage rigidity as in Hall (2005) overall compensation is acyclical. Because the value of
unemployment is higher in booms, when jobs are much easier to find, the worker’s quasi-rent
must be countercyclical to keep wages constant. We consider rent rigidity, where only the rent
component is acyclical, and ask the following question: must a model of wage determination
generate countercyclical rents to match observed volatility, or is rent rigidity sufficient?
Our answer is clear-cut: rent rigidity alone does not come close to matching observed
volatility. Second, we show that many famous and quite different solutions to the wagesetting problem feature at best rent rigidity, but never wage rigidity. We put special but not
exclusive emphasis on environments with asymmetric information, thereby shedding light on
the question raised by Shimer. These are our two main contributions. We now provide some
details.
To show that rent rigidity alone can produce only very limited amplification, we derive
two upper bounds on labor market volatility, which apply if the model of wage determination
generates weakly procyclical worker rents, and are attained if rents are rigid. The first, weak

1

bound applies under mild regularity conditions on the model of wage determination, while
the second, strong bound applies under slightly more demanding conditions. The latter has
the advantage that only information from Shimer’s (2005) calibration is needed to conclude
that it is quantitatively tight : it allows for at most a third of observed volatility. The
same conclusion obtains for the weak bound if one additional element is added to Shimer’s
calibration: empirical information on the average cost of hiring a worker. Thus, unlike wage
rigidity, rent rigidity alone does not enable the model to generate labor market fluctuations
as large as in the data.
The mechanics behind the volatility bounds are as follows. Firms must be compensated
for the initial expense of hiring a worker by receiving quasi-rents over the life of the match.
Assume that worker rents are acyclical, the best case scenario for amplification if they cannot
be countercyclical. There are two possibilities, depending on the size of hiring costs.
First, suppose the average cost of filling a vacancy is small relative to overall gains from
trade in the labor market. In this case only small rents go to firms in compensation for hiring
costs, and worker rents must be large. In other words, finding a job yields unemployed workers
a large capital gain, both in booms and recessions as worker rents are acyclical. Now consider
an increase in the job finding rate. Since worker rents are large and constant, this has a large
positive effect on the opportunity cost of the worker: although the capital gain from finding a
job does not increase, it is large and more likely to accrue to the worker. Added to the constant
rents from employment, this larger value of unemployment translates one to one into a strong
increase in wages. Thus if an increase in productivity raises the job finding rate, then this
feedback effect through wages counteracts the increase in profits and thereby mutes vacancy
creation. Notice that this mechanism is similar to the reason why Nash bargaining generates
little amplification, with one important difference: with Nash bargaining the feedback effect
is driven both by an increase in worker rents and by an increase in the job finding rate. Rigid
rents preserve only the latter effect, but this is strong enough to severely curtail amplification.
The weak bound is solely based on this mechanism, which has bite only if hiring cost are
small. Evidence on hiring costs suggest that they are indeed small relative to overall gains
from trade, allowing us to conclude that the weak bound is quantitatively tight.
The strong bound requires no calibration of hiring costs, because it takes into account a
second effect which curtails amplification if hiring costs are large relative to overall gains from
2

trade in the labor market. In this case firms must receive large quasi-rents as compensation
for the initial hiring expense. Hence worker rents are small. While this weakens the feedback
effect, it introduces a second effect. The matching technology is such that a vacancy is less
likely to result in a match if the ratio of vacancies to unemployment in the economy is large, a
congestion effect. As a consequence, an increase in the vacancy-unemployment ratio induces
a proportional increase in the cost of filling a vacancy. If hiring costs are large on average,
this increase is large in absolute value. More importantly, if the increase in the vacancyunemployment ratio is caused by an increase in productivity, then the increase in hiring costs
is large relative to the original increase in productivity, once again muting vacancy creation.
To summarize our first contribution, rent rigidity is quantitatively much closer to Nash
bargaining than it is to wage rigidity. Thus merely switching to a different model of wage
determination does not allow the search and matching model to match observed volatility,
unless the model of wage determination is capable of generating countercyclical worker rents.
Our second contribution is to show that rent rigidity, thus our volatility bounds, apply to an
interesting class of models of wage determination. We focus on environments with asymmetric
information, thereby shedding light on Shimer’s question whether this can amplify the response
of the model to productivity shocks. We assume that, upon being matched, the firm privately
draws a match-specific productivity component and the worker a match-specific amenity value
of the job. The distributions are fixed and independent of (publicly observed) aggregate labor
productivity, and satisfy standard regularity conditions, but are otherwise unrestricted. In this
environment, we study in detail three classical wage determination models. In the monopoly
(or monopsony) solution, where either the firm or the worker makes a take-it-or-leave-it wage
proposal to the other privately informed party, it follows naturally that worker rents cannot
be countercyclical. If the firm is making the offer, it becomes more eager to trade in a boom,
and as a consequence it will concede more informational rents to the worker. If the worker is
making the offer, then in a boom once again firms are more eager to trade, thus the worker is
in a better position to extract rents through more aggressive wage requests. In both cases the
most that can be hoped for is no increase in worker rents in a boom. This basic intuition carries
over when we relax the commitment assumptions associated with take-it-or-leave-it offers, and
study strategic bargaining, both repeated one-sided offers (Coase conjecture) and alternating
offers. Finally, in an environment with bilateral asymmetric information, we consider the
3

constrained efficient allocation, obtained with the help of a mediator (e.g. an arbitrator in
wage contracting), as in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983). Again we show that rent rigidity
is the most that can be obtained, for a similar reason: in a boom the mediator desires to induce
more trade, and in order to do so he has to increase informational rents going to workers.
To summarize our second contribution, at the very least asymmetric information introduces, through the distribution of types, many additional degrees of freedom that can be
exploited to generate wage rigidity. In the models we study, however, these degrees of freedom are not enough to match observed labor market volatility.
Others have taken up Shimer’s question and investigated whether asymmetric information
enables the search and matching model to produce larger labor market fluctuations. Guerrieri
(2006) studies competitive search equilibrium, whereas we analyze bargaining games with
random matching, making the two analyses complementary. The approaches are different,
however. She simulates the model for some specific distributions of types. We derive labor
market volatility bounds that apply for any distribution of types. In fact, one can show that
our bounds also apply to her model. Her results are consistent with ours: she finds very little
amplification. Kennan (2006) and Menzio (2005b) take a different route, relying on exogenous
fluctuations in the shape of the distribution of types as the key driving force of labor market
fluctuations. In contrast, Guerrieri’s and this paper keep the extent of asymmetric information
itself acyclical, examining how the presence of asymmetric information amplifies the response
of the model to a productivity shock.
In Section 2 we introduce the economy. The labor market volatility bounds are derived
in Section 3. In Section 4 we verify these bounds for the models of wage bargaining under
asymmetric information. For simplicity, the analysis in Sections 2–4 restricts attention to
permanent labor productivity shocks. A fortiori, our results also apply to transitory shocks,
which generate a weaker response of the labor market. For completeness, Section 5 formally
derives the bounds for the case of transitory shocks, and provides an illustration using the
monopoly model. Section 6 concludes.

2

The Economy

We consider the baseline search-and-matching model employed by Shimer (2005). We extend
it to allow for bilateral asymmetric information about match-specific values: the worker may
have private information about how much he likes the job, and the firm may have private
information about productivity.

2.1

Preferences and Technology

The economy is populated by a measure 1 of workers and a much larger measure of firms. All
agents are infinitely-lived, risk neutral and share the discount rate r > 0. Workers can either be
employed or unemployed. An unemployed worker receives flow utility b and searches for a job.
Employed workers receive endogenously determined wage payments from their employers and
cannot search for other jobs. Firms can search for a worker by maintaining an open vacancy
at flow cost c. Free entry implies that the value of an open vacancy is zero. Unemployed
workers u and vacancies v are matched at rate m(u, v) where m is a constant returns to scale
matching function. Let θ ≡

v
u

denote the vacancy-unemployment ratio. Then vacancies are

matched at rate m (1/θ, 1) ≡ q(θ) and workers are matched at rate m(1, θ) = θq(θ).
Upon being matched, the worker draws a match specific amenity value z from the distribution FZ and the firm draws a match specific productivity component y from the distribution
FY . The draws are once and for all until the match dissolves. Without loss in generality, the
two distributions have mean zero. Output of the match is given by p + y, so p is ex ante
average labor productivity. However, in general, not all matches are formed and p will not
equal labor productivity averaged across existing matches. We will refer to p as the aggregate
component of labor productivity. The amenity value z adds to the wage to determine the
flow value of employment for the worker. This value z may be private information of the
worker, and the idiosyncratic productivity component y may be private information of the
firm. Matches are destroyed exogenously at rate δ.
We want to study the magnitude of the response of the labor market to aggregate labor
productivity shocks. One way to proceed would be to specify a stochastic process for labor
productivity and evaluate the labor market volatility it induces. But to obtain upper bounds
on labor market volatility we can simply examine the response of the model to a permanent
5

unanticipated productivity shock. This response provides an upper bound to the volatility
induced by a stochastic process with transitory shocks for an intuitive reason: a given increase
in productivity increases incentives to create jobs more the longer it is expected to last.1 Of
course, this simpler approach introduces some slack and it may be possible to obtain tighter
bounds which explicitly account for the degree of persistence of productivity shocks. However,
due to the strong persistence of labor productivity in US data, the gain from such a tighter
bound would be quantitatively small. Thus the analysis in Sections 2–4 analyzes the case
of permanent productivity shocks, as the the cost of doing so is small relative to the gains
in terms of both simplicity and transparency of the analysis. In Section 5 we generalize the
analysis to the case of transitory shocks.

2.2

Wage Determination

Due to search frictions, a match generates quasi-rents. Thus we need to make assumptions
regarding how these rents are split between the worker and the firm. In other words, we need
a model of wage determination: a mapping of the relevant variables that describe the environment of the match into a decision whether to trade and how to split the quasi-rents associated
with the match. We work with a general definition of a model of wage determination, because
our objective is to obtain volatility bounds that apply to entire classes of models of wage
determination.
Here the assumption that productivity shocks are unanticipated and permanent keeps
matters simple: the environment of the match is characterized by only two aggregate variables.
The first is productivity p, which is expected to be constant over the life of the match. The
second variable is the endogenous opportunity cost of the worker, which is given by the
utility associated with unemployment U . It will be convenient to let n = rU represent
the opportunity cost of the worker in flow terms. This opportunity cost is a jump variable
1

An extreme example may help in building intuition. Suppose matches last for several years on average.

Moreover, suppose that the economy switches between boom and recession every week. Clearly matches
created in booms and recessions are essentially the same, and the additional incentives to create matches in
booms are minimal relative to the case in which the economy switches from boom to recession only every few
years. See Section 5 as well as Mortensen and Nagypal (2005) and Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2005)
for a more formal development of this point.

and constant along the equilibrium path of the economy following a productivity shock, a
convenient feature of the standard search and matching model.
For each pair of match-specific values y and z, a model of wage determination maps the
two variables p and n into a trade decision and a split of quasi-rents. It is important to
emphasize that the timing of wage payments over the life of a match is of no importance for
labor market fluctuations. Only the present value of rents going to the worker and the firm
matter. Thus we formulate a model of wage determination directly in terms of the present
values of rents.
Let G(y, z, p, n) denote the present value of rents going to the worker, J(y, z, p, n) denote
the present value of rents going to the firm, and x(y, z, p, n) be the probability that a match
is formed conditional on the realizations y and z.
Definition 1. A model of wage determination is a triple of functions {G, J, x} mapping R4
into R2+ × [0, 1] and satisfying
(r + δ) [G(y, z, p, n) + J(y, z, p, n)] = x(y, z, p, n)(y + z + p − n).
In terms of standard notation, the overall payoff of the employed worker is W = G + U ,
so G = W − U is the familiar capital gain an unemployed worker receives from being hired.
Although the timing of wage payments over the life of the match is not important, in order
to provide a link with wages, one can define the annuity value of the present value of wages
w(p, n, y, z) = (r + δ)G(y, z, p, n) + n − z, which would be the level of the wage if payments
were constant over the life of the match. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of a model of
wage determination. The entire bar represents the value of the match in flow terms, namely
7

p + y + z − b. The gray bar represents the opportunity cost of the worker n, and the white bar
the quasi-rents which are split between the firm and the worker. The annuity value of profits
is (r + δ)J(y, z, p, n), the annuity value of rents going to the worker is (r + δ)G(y, z, p, n).
Adding the opportunity cost n to the latter and subtracting the amenity value of the job z
yields the annuity value of wages w(p, n, y, z).
We illustrate this concept with two specific models which will serve as important benchmarks throughout the paper.
Nash bargaining. Under Nash bargaining as commonly employed in the textbook search
and matching model, quasi-rents of the match are shared between the worker and the firm
with shares β and 1 − β, respectively: in flow terms
(r + δ)G(y, z, p, n) = x(y, z, p, n)β(p − n + y + z),
(r + δ)J(y, z, p, n) = x(y, z, p, n)(1 − β)(p − n + y + z).
The probability of trade is one if forming the match is ex post efficient, zero otherwise:
x(y, z, p, n) = I {p − n + y + z ≥ 0} where I is an indicator function.
Wage Rigidity (Hall (2005)). Hall considers a model without heterogeneity in y and z.
Trade is bilaterally efficient, that is x(p, n) = I{p − n ≥ 0}. Wages are rigid in the following
sense: the annuity value of wages received by the worker in a new match w̄ does not respond
to changes in p and n, as long as this does not interfere with efficient trade:

otherwise,

As discussed before, the timing of wage payments through which the annuity value w̄ is
implemented is not essential here.
We now use the graphical apparatus introduced in Figure 1 to compare these two models
of wage determination. In doing so, we also introduce the key distinction between the two
notions of rigidity contrasted in this paper: wage rigidity vs. rent rigidity. The basic idea is
illustrated in Figure 2, where we abstract from match-specific draws y and z for simplicity.

Each panel encompasses two replicas of Figure 1, one for a low aggregate state pL and one for
a high aggregate state pH > pL .
Panel (a) displays the case of Nash Bargaining. The quasi-rent is split with fixed shares
β and (1 − β). As the overall quasi-rent is procyclical, it follows that the rent going to the
worker is also procyclical.2
Panel (b) shows the case of wage rigidity. Even with rigid wages the opportunity cost of
workers are procyclical in the stochastic equilibrium of the economy.3 As shown in the figure,
this implies that rents must be countercyclical.
Panel (c) illustrates the contrast with the notion of rent rigidity. Here the rent going to the
worker does not increase in a boom, but the annuity value of wages w(p, n) increases because
the opportunity cost of the worker n does. In this sense, rent rigidity is weaker than wage
rigidity.
It is instructive to relate rent rigidity to Nash bargaining with an ad hoc countercyclical
bargaining share β(p). Shimer (2005) shows in a reduced form experiment that making the
bargaining share somewhat countercyclical helps in generating more volatile unemployment
and vacancies. We emphasize that a countercyclical bargaining share per se does not imply
countercyclical rents. It is clear from Figure 2 (c) that if the bargaining share is only slightly
countercyclical, then rents remain procyclical. As one continues to make the bargaining share
more countercyclical, eventually the qualitative threshold will be crossed at which rents also
become countercyclical. One way of putting the question we will answer in the next section
is then as follows: do we need to cross this threshold in order to generate the observed extent
of volatility?

2.3

Equilibrium Conditions

Having defined models of wage determination we can now write down the equilibrium conditions of the model. Before doing so, it is useful to make precise how we will evaluate the extent
of labor market volatility generated by the model. We follow the literature and focus on the
2

Procyclicality of the overall quasi-rent is an equilibrium implication of the standard search and matching

model with Nash bargaining, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.
3
As we will show in Section 3, in a boom, even though unemployed workers do not get a higher wage should
they find a job, they are more likely to find a job, so the value of unemployment increases.

10

vacancy-unemployment ratio θ =

v
u

rather than unemployment and vacancies separately. In

US data, detrended vacancies and unemployment are strongly negatively correlated, so their
ratio is especially volatile. Thus the volatility of the v-u ratio presents a convenient way of
capturing the challenge facing the model in a single statistic.4
The model has two endogenous variables: the v-u ratio θ and the opportunity cost of the
worker n. Both immediately jump to their new steady state values in response to a permanent
productivity shock.5 Thus one can compute the elasticity εθ of the v-u ratio with respect to
a productivity shock by differentiating the steady state equations of the model.
Given a model of wage determination, we can compute the ex ante (before matching)
averages of rents and the probability of

With this notation we study two steady state conditions in (θ, n).6 First, the free entry
condition, equating the flow cost of posting a vacancy c to the expected capital gain, which is
the rate q(θ) at which open vacancies meet a worker, times the expected value J (p, n) to the
firm of meeting a worker, taking into account that the match may potentially fail to form:
c = q(θ)J (p, n).

(2)

Second, the equation determining the flow value of unemployment as the flow value of leisure
b plus the expected capital gain, the rate θq(θ) at which unemployed workers contact open
vacancies times the expected return G(p, n) from the contact, again taking into account that
the match may potentially fail to form:
n = b + θq(θ)G(p, n).
4

(3)

Moreover, as discussed by Shimer (2005) the model already does reasonably well at capturing comove-

ment and relative volatility of unemployment and vacancies. In this sense there is little need to examine
unemployment and vacancies separately, and it is sufficient to focus on the volatility of the v-u ratio.

Labor Market Volatility Bounds

In this section we derive two bounds on labor market volatility and evaluate them quantitatively. These bounds apply to models of wage determination which generate weakly procyclical, that is at best rigid but not countercyclical, worker rents.
So far we have not put any structure on the three functions that make up the model of
wage determination. We now introduce a set of regularity conditions. They are quite weak
and are satisfied by all models of wage determination considered in this paper, including Nash
bargaining and wage rigidity. This is important since we are interested in models of wage
determination which lie in some sense in between these two benchmark models.
Condition 1. The model of wage determination {G, J, x} satisfies three properties:
(a) The partial effect of aggregate labor productivity p on ex ante worker rents is nonnegative: for all p, n,
∂G(p, n)
≥ 0.
∂p
(b) The partial effect of the worker’s opportunity cost n on ex ante firm rents is non-positive:
for all p, n,
∂J (p, n)
≤ 0.
∂n
(c) The trade probability x(p, n, y, z) depends on p and n only through their difference p −
n, and is weakly increasing in both match-specific outcomes, the firm’s idiosyncratic
productivity component y and the worker’s amenity value for the job z.
Part (a) requires that holding worker opportunity cost n constant, an increase in labor
productivity will not reduce worker rents. Importantly, this does not imply procyclical worker
rents: under wage rigidity the partial effect of labor productivity is exactly zero; thus worker
rents are countercyclical as worker opportunity costs n increase in booms. Similarly, part (b)
does not imply that firm profits are countercyclical. Again wage rigidity represents the extreme
case in which the partial effect is zero; firm rents under wage rigidity are then procyclical as
the productivity component p is higher in booms.
Both Nash bargaining and wage rigidity feature ex post efficient trade, that is trade occurs
if and only if p − n + y + z ≥ 0. Ex post efficiency immediately implies part (c). The converse
12

is not true, that is part (c) is weaker than ex post efficiency. We will see that part (c)
holds for all the models featuring ex post inefficient trade considered in Section 4. For an
interpretation of this property, first consider comparative statics with respect to p and n. If p
and n increase by the same amount, this shifts up the location of the bargaining problem to
a higher level of productivity and opportunity cost, but leaves the average gains from trade
p − n unchanged. Condition 1 (c) requires that such a shift leaves the probability of trade
unaffected. The second requirement of Condition 1 (c) specifies that matches are positively
RR
selected. Let ȳ(p, n) ≡ ξ(p, n)−1
x(p, n, y, z)ydFY (y)dFZ (z) be the average match specific
productivity component conditional on trade. Condition 1 (c) implies ȳ(p, n) ≥ 0.7 Similarly,

it implies that the conditional mean amenity value z̄(p, n) is non-negative.
We now derive two bounds on labor market volatility, referred to as weak and strong,
respectively. The weak bound is less tight theoretically, and more empirical information must
be utilized in order to conclude that it is tight quantitatively. The second bound holds under
more stringent conditions on the model of wage determination.

3.1

Weak Labor Market Volatility Bound

The first bound applies to all models of wage determination that satisfy the following property
(along with regularity Condition 1).
Definition 2. (Increasing Worker Rents) In a model of wage determination {G, J, x},
worker rents are Increasing if, for all p, n,
∂G(p, n)
∂G(p, n)
≥−
≥ 0.
∂p
∂n
Notice that this property is stronger than Condition 1 (a): the partial effect of aggregate
labor productivity p on worker rents is not only non-negative, but it is required to exceed in
absolute value the effect of the worker’s opportunity cost n on worker rents.
To explain the role of Increasing worker rents, it is useful to define the following property
of the equilibrium.
Definition 3. (Procyclical Worker Rents) Worker rents are Procyclical in equilibrium

∂n dp
As will emerge clearly from the derivation, the weak labor market volatility bound applies
whenever worker rents are Procyclical in equilibrium. Procyclicality, however, is a feature
of the equilibrium and not a condition that can be verified only examining the model of
wage determination. Increasing worker rents is a sufficient condition on the model of wage
determination which insures that worker rents are Procyclical in equilibrium.
We obtain the volatility bound for θ in three steps. First we show that if worker rents are
Procyclical and the elasticity εθ = d ln θ/d ln p has to be positive, then the opportunity cost
of the worker responds less than one for one to an increase in productivity, that is

into the desired upper bound on εθ , which applies

whenever worker rents are Procyclical. Finally we show that if worker rents are Increasing,
then they are Procyclical.
First, we show that εθ > 0 implies

dn
dp

< 1. If the increase in the outside option of the

worker in a boom was so large as to overturn the increase in productivity, then firm rents
would shrink, which is inconsistent with more intensive hiring activity of firms. We refer to
∂J dn
∂n dp

as the feedback effect, as it captures how an increase in profits that raises vacancies and

thereby the job finding rate feeds back negatively into profits through a higher opportunity
cost of workers. To see that firm profits must shrink, namely
that

∂J
∂p

dJ
dp

≤ 0, if

dn
dp

≥ 1, first suppose

≤ 0. Then both the increase in productivity and — by virtue of part Condition 1

(b) — the increase in n reduce firm profits. If instead

∂J
∂p

≥ 0 it follows from parts (a) and

(c) of Condition 1 that the sum of worker and firm rents must be increasing in p − n. In this
case

dn
dp

≥ 1 implies that total rents fall, and Procyclical worker rents imply that once again

firm rents must decrease. Through the entry condition (2) lower firm rents in turn imply that
labor market tightness must fall, contradicting εθ > 0.
Second, from Equation (3), it is clear that an increase in worker rents raises the opportunity
cost n: a larger capital gain from finding a job increases the utility of unemployed workers.
Specifically, Procyclical worker rents and Equation (3) imply the following lower bound on

Here η ≡ 1 −

denotes the elasticity of the matching function with respect to vacancies,

evaluated at the initial equilibrium. Similarly, θ, q, and G are the v-u ratio, the contact rate of
vacancies, and worker rents, all evaluated at the initial equilibrium. Inequality (4) holds as an
equality if worker rents are completely rigid. Notice that even in that case

dn
dp

is positive: the

value of unemployment increases because it is easier to find a job. Moreover, a large elasticity
εθ implies that the job finding rate responds strongly to an increase in productivity, leading
to a larger value of

dn
.
dp

Combining (4) with

dn
dp

< 1 from the first step implies an upper bound

on the elasticity εθ
εθ ≤

1 1 p
.
η θq G

(5)

The interpretation of this upper bound is straightforward. If η is large, then the job finding
rate responds strongly to an increase in θ because vacancies are very productive in the creation
of matches. This is associated with a stronger feedback effect and leads to a tighter bound on
εθ . If the job-finding rate θq is larger, then a given percentage increase in θ translates into a
larger increase in the chances of finding a job, also tightening the bound. Finally, the bound
is tighter if the level of rents going to the worker is higher. If the capital gain of finding a job
is zero, then a higher job-finding rate does not translate into a higher value of unemployment
because there is nothing to be gained from finding a job.
To turn (5) into a bound that can be evaluated quantitatively we need to calibrate worker
rents G. For this purpose we introduce some additional notation. First the annuity value of
wages in the initial equilibrium is w ≡ (r + δ)ξ −1 G + n − z̄ (recall that the average amenity
value z̄ must be deducted from the average flow utility of an employed worker in order to
obtain wages). Next define the job finding rate
f ≡ θqξ,
which is the product of the matching rate θq and the probability of match formation ξ. Finally
define observed average labor productivity, the average of p + y conditional on trade p̄ ≡ p + ȳ.
Using this notation together with Equation (3) we can rewrite (5) as
εθ ≤

p̄ − ȳ 1 r + δ + f
.
w + z̄ − b η
f

At this point we use Condition 1 (c): the fact that matches that do form are positively selected

15

implies that ȳ ≥ 0 and z̄ ≥ 0. This yields
εθ ≤

p̄ p̄ − b 1 r + δ + f
≡ ε̄θ,W EAK .
p̄ − b w − b η
f

The third and final step is to show that if worker rents are Increasing, then they are
Procyclical. Suppose not. This can only happen if
conjunction with Condition 1 (c) imply

> 1. Increasing worker rents in

imply that firm rents decrease in response to an increase in p. For firms to be willing to post
vacancies in the face of lower rents the v-u ratio must fall, that is equilibrium condition (2)
implies εθ ≤ 0. But with both worker rents and the job finding rate countercyclical it follows
from Equation (3) that the utility of unemployed workers must be lower, that is

dn
dp

≤ 0, a

contradiction.
We have established the following:
Proposition 1. (Weak Volatility Bound) If the model of wage determination satisfies
Condition 1 and worker rents are Procyclical, then εθ ≤ ε̄θ,W EAK . If worker rents are Increasing, then they are Procyclical.
Our approach in Section 4 is to show that a given model of wage determination under
asymmetric information satisfies both Condition 1 and Increasing worker rents. Proposition 1
then allows us to conclude that this model of wage determination is subject to the weak labor
market volatility bound. Proposition 1 can also be applied in a different way: if a model of
wage determination satisfies Condition 1 but generates amplification in excess of the bound,
then it must produce countercyclical worker rents. That is, finding a job yields a larger gain
in a slump. We illustrate this application with the following model of wage determination.
Outside Option Principle. Hall and Milgrom (2007) consider the bargaining theory of
Binmore, Rubinstein, and Wolinsky (1986). According to this theory, the relevant threat
point of the worker is not unemployment but delay of bargaining, say a strike. Let bs be the
flow payoff of the worker during a strike, which could be different from the flow payoff during
unemployment b. The game has a unique subgame perfect equilibrium which yields a wage
w(p, n) = bs + 12 (p − bs ). This is similar in form to the Nash bargaining wage, but with the
strike value bs replacing the opportunity cost n. The model is given by x(p, n) = I{p − n ≥ 0}
16

Condition 1 is easily verified, but since

Moreover, with an elasticity

the model can generate a volatility exceeding the bound ε̄θ,W EAK , by choosing bs sufficiently
close to p. However, Proposition 1 allows us to conclude that the only way this can occur is
if the model generates countercyclical worker rents in equilibrium. This is not obvious, as in
principle the model can generate procyclical worker rents if bs is sufficiently close to b.8

3.2

Strong Labor Market Volatility Bound

We now derive a second volatility bound which is stronger in that it uses more theory, is
qualitatively tighter. Moreover, less empirical information is required to conclude that it is
quantitatively tight.
As the starting point, notice that the derivation of the weak bound was based almost
entirely on the second equilibrium condition (3). The entry condition (2) was used only to a
limited extent, to show that a more than one for one response of opportunity costs

dn
dp

≥1

is inconsistent with a positive elasticity εθ . In particular, the weak bound is based on the
feedback effect arising from condition (3). As we discussed this effect is strong if the annuity
value of wages and thus worker rents are large. As the annuity value of wages approaches b (or
equivalently worker rents approach zero) the feedback effect vanishes and the bound becomes
very loose, asymptoting to infinity.
We now show that if worker rents are small, then a second effect neglected by the weak
bound comes into play and limits amplification. The strong bound is obtained by fully exploiting the entry condition. The mechanics are as follows. If total rents from a match are
8

One can check that worker rents are procyclical for b = bs under Shimer’s calibration.

17

not negligible and worker rents are small, then firm rents are large. Because of free entry, firm
rents exactly equal the expected cost of hiring a worker. This cost is given by

c
,
qξ

that is the

flow cost multiplied by the average duration of a vacancy. Notice that an increase in the v-u
ratio makes the recruiting effort of firms less effective due to a congestion effect: an increase
in θ by one percent increases hiring costs by 1 − η percent. Thus if firm rents and thereby
hiring costs are large and if θ is strongly procyclical, then the increase in hiring costs in a
boom will be large both in absolute terms and relative to the increase in productivity. For this
to be consistent with the entry condition it must be that firm rents are highly responsive to
productivity, that is

∂J
∂p

must be large. However, it is easy to see that under both wage rigidity

and Nash bargaining the response of flow firm rents (r + δ) ∂J
cannot exceed the probability
∂p
of trade. This motivates the following regularity condition.
Condition 2. In a model of wage determination {G, J, x} firm rents satisfy the property
(r + δ)

∂J (p, n)
≤ ξ(p, n).
∂p

To see that this condition holds in the case of wage rigidity, notice that the probability of
trade is ξ = 1. Since (r + δ) ∂J
= 1 Condition 2 holds with equality. For Nash bargaining
∂p
(r + δ) ∂J
= (1 − β)ξ, so Condition 2 holds with some slack. More generally, notice that ex
∂p


∂G
∂J
post efficient trade implies (r + δ) ∂p + ∂p = ξ. This follows from the envelope theorem

which implies that the indirect effect of an increase in p through the adjustment of the trading

decision is zero. Thus Condition 2 follows from ex post efficient trade in conjunction with
Condition 1 (a). In this case Condition 2 is innocuous. Moreover, we will see that Condition
2 also holds for some models with asymmetric information despite ex post inefficient trade.
But while Condition 1 applies to all models of wage determination considered in this paper,
we do find some cases in which Condition 2 fails. Thus the first bound retains a separate role
to deal with such cases.
To derive the strong bound we log-differentiate the system of Equations (2)–(3) with
respect to productivity p and solve for the elasticity εθ :
εθ =

p̄ − ȳ
f
φ(p̄ − w)(1 − η) + (w + z̄ − b)η r+δ+f

first show that Increasing worker rents in conjunction with Condition 2 implies φ ≥ 1. First

as was reflected in the first bound, the feedback effect puts a tighter limit

is new and captures the congestion effect. This effect is more severe if η is low, that is if

an increase in the v-u ratio has a strong negative effect on the rate at which vacancies contact
workers. The weight on this term is the fraction of the gains from market activity going to
firms. Recall that this fraction is large precisely when the level of hiring costs is large. A large
level of hiring costs combined with a low η means that the absolute increase in hiring costs in
a boom is large relative to the increase in productivity, putting a tight limit on amplification.

19

We have established the following:9
Proposition 2. (Strong Volatility Bound) If the model of wage determination satisfies
Conditions 1 and 2 and if worker rents are Increasing, then εθ ≤ ε̄θ,ST RON G .
We now show how the strong bound can be attained. This is of theoretical interest because
one would like to know whether the bound is tight for the class of models of wage determination
satisfying Conditions 1 and 2. It will also turn out to be of some interest quantitatively to
the extent that the bound allows for some amplification vis-a-vis Nash bargaining.
Complete Rent Rigidity. Consider the following mode of wage determination. Trade is
bilaterally efficient, that is x(p, n) = I{p − n ≥ 0}. The worker receives a fixed flow rent g > 0
which does not respond to changes in p and n, unless it would interfere with efficient trade:

Notice that worker rents are acyclical by construction. Conditions 1 and 2 are easily verified.
It is straightforward to check that the elasticity of the v-u ratio generated by the model is
exactly ε̄θ,ST RON G , where the annuity value of wages is related to the rent parameter g through
the formula g =

r+δ
(w
r+δ+f

− b). This model is ad hoc in the same way as Hall’s rigid wage. In

analogy to Hall (2005), one may think of it as an alternative equilibrium selection of a double
auction, and interpret it as a norm or social consensus which applies to worker rents rather
than the level of wages. An alternative well-known model of wage determination that delivers
complete rent rigidity is the Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) efficiency wage shirking model.10
9

The weak bound applies not only if worker rents are Increasing, but also if they are just Procyclical. For

the strong bound we can obtain an analogous result, but it requires a stronger version of Condition 2. If

that φ ≥ 1 we need to strengthen (r + δ) ∂J
∂p ≤ ξ to (r + δ) ∂p + ∂p ≤ ξ. If the model of wage determination

satisfies this property along with Condition 1, then the strong bound applies if worker rents are Procyclical.
10

According to Equation (5) in their paper, the worker receives a flow rent g =

(r+δ+q)e
q

where e is the

cost to the worker of providing effort, and q is the rate at which a shirking worker is caught. Thus rents are
completely rigid in response to a shock to aggregate labor productivity as long as both e and q do not vary
with productivity p.

20

An interesting question is whether the bound can be attained not only through complete
rent rigidity, but also by the models of wage determination under asymmetric information
considered in Section 4. There we provide an affirmative answer for the monopoly model.
The model of complete rent rigidity attains the strong bound. The difference between
the two bounds is that the first bound neglects the congestion effect. This implies that the
weak bound cannot be attained by any model of wage determination that generates a nonzero congestion effect. The congestion effect is positive as long as

∂J
∂p

is finite. With ex post

efficient trade this is always the case. Since the model of complete rent rigidity features ex
post efficient trade, it cannot attain the weak bound. Introducing ex post inefficient trade in
an ad hoc fashion into the model of complete rent rigidity would enable it to attain the weak
bound.11

3.3

Calibration

We now evaluate the two volatility bounds quantitatively and compare them to Nash bargaining and wage rigidity. To make this comparison we need to compute the elasticities of the
v-u ratio associated with these models of wage determination. In analogy to the bounds we
express these elasticities in terms of the parameters η, p, b, r, δ, together with the equilibrium
job finding rate f and the equilibrium annuity value of wages w. The formulas are written to
facilitate comparison with the bounds:

rates from BLS data. He sets δ equal to the average separation rate of 0.1. The data on
the job finding rate together with data on the v-u ratio is used to estimate the matching
function elasticity, yielding η = 0.28. Given the value of the matching function elasticity,
Shimer chooses the Nash bargaining parameter β such that the Hosios (1990) condition is
satisfied, that is β = 1 − η = 0.72.13 It is more difficult to calibrate the value of non-market
activity b. If one is willing to assume that it stems solely from unemployment benefits one
can use replacement rates. Proceeding along these lines Shimer sets

the calibration of this parameter below.
Notice that the vacancy cost c does not appear in the table. It is pinned down by calibrating
the model to match the average job finding rate f = 1.35.

model with Nash bargaining Shimer does not need to directly calibrate the annuity value of

= 0.9826. When calibrating the model with a rigid wage,

Hall (2005) and Shimer (2004) must choose a level of the rigid wage and thus of the annuity
value of wages. They sidestep the issue of independently calibrating the wage by adopting
the level implied by the model with Nash bargaining under the Hosios condition. We could
proceed in the same way. It is desirable, however, to calibrate the wage level independently,

Shimer assumes a Cobb-Douglas matching function, for which β = 1 − η implies social efficiency of the

Over the life of the match the firm receives the flow p̄ − w.

The present value of this flow must be such that the firm recoups the initial hiring costs. Both
Silva and Toledo (2007) as well as Hagedorn and Manovskii (2006) utilize evidence provided by
Barron, Berger, and Black (1997) which in turn is based on the 1982 Employment Opportunity
Project and the 1992 Small Business Administration survey. This evidence suggests that the
average labor cost of hiring a worker corresponds to between 3 and 4.5 percent of the quarterly
wage. This does not include costs such as advertisement, and citing further evidence Silva
and Toledo (2006) argue that total hiring costs could be as high as 14 percent of the quarterly
wage. This is close to the estimate of 13 percent provided by Abowd and Kramarz (2003)
for French data. For our purposes it suffices to identify a region in which hiring costs could
reasonably lie. Proceeding conservatively based on the evidence above we consider hiring costs
between 3 percent and 30 percent of quarterly wages. Using Equation (8) this yields a range

the model emphasized by Shimer (2005). The upward sloping dashed-dotted line represents
the elasticity generated by wage rigidity. The range of elasticities induced by a rigid wage in
the shaded region is [42.74, 420.88]. Thus for reasonable values of hiring costs a rigid wage

This suggests that

wage rigidity generates more than enough amplification, leaving room for the possibility that a
weaker form of rigidity could suffice to match observed labor market volatility.14 In particular,
one may ask whether rent rigidity is capable of doing so.
A negative answer to this question is provided by the plots of the two volatility bounds.
Both are represented by solid lines, the strong bound with crosses. Over the shaded region of
interest the two bounds are quantitatively close and vary little: the weak bound ranges from
6.48 to 6.82 whereas the strong bound ranges from 5.88 to 6.38. Thus for reasonable values of
hiring costs, models of wage determination that generate procyclical worker rents can generate
at most a third of observed volatility.15 In other words, replacing Nash bargaining by a model
14

The range of elasticities [42.74, 420.88] overstates the case that a rigid wage generates more than enough

amplification. As discussed before, the case of permanent shocks provides an upper bound for the case in which
persistence is calibrated to US data. To investigate this issue we calibrated the rigid wage model following
the approach of Shimer (2005) for wage levels in the shaded range and obtained the range [20.8, 57.9] for the
relative coefficient of variation

σ θ µp
σ p µθ .

Thus it is still the case that a rigid wage generates relative volatility in

excess of what is observed.
15
Mortensen and Nagypal (2005) argue that 7.52 is a more appropriate target for the elasticity εθ than
the value of 19 implicit in Shimer (2005). Their argument is based on the relatively low empirical correlation

24

with rigid rents does not provide a silver bullet for resolving the inability of the model to
match observed labor market fluctuations. Nevertheless, some amplification vis-a-vis Nash
bargaining is not ruled out by the bound. Thus it is of interest whether the bound can be
attained. We have already shown that the strong bound can be attained with complete rent
rigidity, and in Section 4 we show how it is attained by a model of wage determination under
asymmetric information.16
Notice that the two bounds coincide for

w
p̄

= 1. Recall that the difference between the

two bounds is that the weak bound neglects the congestion effect. This effect is zero for
w
p̄

= 1. If the model is calibrated to a lower annuity value of wages

w
p̄

< 1, then a gap appears

between the two bounds. The weak bound increases as it only reflects the feedback effect,
whose strength is reduced if wages and thus worker rents are small. It asymptotes to infinity
because the feedback effect disappears as the annuity value of wages approaches the value of
non-market activity b. In contrast, the strong bound is an increasing function of the annuity
value of wages. Recall from Equation (7) that the strong bound is a weighted average of the
feedback and the congestion effect. The weight on the feedback effect is an increasing function
of the annuity value of wages. Thus the slope of the strong bound depends on which of the two
effects puts a tighter limit on labor market fluctuations. The plot shows that the congestion
effect is more severe: calibrating the model to match a lower annuity value of wages reduces
the amplification generated by rent rigidity. Setting w = b puts all weight on the congestion
effect and yields ε̄θ,ST RON G =

p̄

setting w = p̄ yields ε̄θ,ST RON G =

= 2.31; putting all weight on the feedback effect by

p̄ 1 r+δ+f
p̄−b η
f

= 6.45. Importantly, the strong bound is finite

between labor market tightness and labor productivity, suggesting that part of fluctuations in labor market
tightness is due to other shocks. Rent rigidity comes close to attaining their 7.52 target. Thus while rent
rigidity alone cannot enable the model solely driven by productivity shocks to match observed volatility, a
model with rigid rents and multiple shocks could get close. On the other hand, the appropriate target for εθ
could be even higher than Shimer’s 19 if the low empirical correlation between labor market tightness and
labor productivity reflects measurement error in the latter rather than other shocks.
16
That the model can attain the bound does not mean that the relative coefficient of variation

σ θ µp
σ p µθ

from

simulations with productivity persistence calibrated to US data is necessarily close to the strong bound, for
the reason already discussed in Footnote 14. Simulating the model for the usual range of wages, following the
approach of Shimer (2005), yields yields the range [5.18, 6.30] for the relative coefficient of variation, compared
to the corresponding values for the bound [5.88, 6.38]. Thus the simulated model comes very close to attaining
bound.

irrespective of the annuity value of wages. In this sense it requires less empirical information
than the weak bound. In particular, using only parameters from Shimer’s calibration and
without calibrating hiring costs we can conclude that models of wage determination subject
to the strong bound cannot generate more than a third of observed volatility.
The congestion effect is maximized if the annuity value of wages w equals the value of
non-market activity. In this case Nash bargaining, rent rigidity and wage rigidity all coincide.
The plot of the strong bound illustrates that rent rigidity lies between Nash bargaining and
wage rigidity, but quantitatively it is much closer to the former (remember that the scale is
logarithmic).
Why does the congestion effect put a tighter limit on fluctuations than the feedback effect in
Shimer’s calibration? The size of the feedback effect is determined by the term

1 r+δ+f
.
η
f

Since

f ≫ r + δ this is well approximated by η1 . The strength of the congestion effect is determined
by

1
.
1−η

Thus which one of the two effects puts a tighter bound on amplification in essence

just depends on the matching function elasticity η. If η is below

1
2

as in Shimer’s calibration,

then an increase in the number of vacancies primarily causes congestion with little effect on
the job finding rate and a correspondingly weak feedback effect. If instead η is above

1
2

an

increase in vacancies is associated with a strong response of the number of matches, causing
little congestion while substantially increasing the job finding rate of unemployed workers.
Since the elasticity η plays such an important role it is useful to consider how changing this
parameter affects the bounds. This is particularly important since Shimer’s value lies at
the low end of the reasonable range of [0.3, 0.5] identified in the survey by Petrongolo and
Pissarides (2001). In Figure 4 we consider the other end of the spectrum η = 0.5. The strong
bound is flat as the congestion and feedback effects are now roughly balanced. The feedback
effect is strengthened relative to Shimer’s calibration, and now generates a much tighter bound
over the shaded region of about 3.61. This is not much higher than the maximal elasticity
of 3.33 which Nash bargaining is able to generate, albeit only for very large values of hiring
costs.
Next we discuss the role of the value of non-market activity b. Our two bounds and the
elasticities of the v-u ratio generated by Nash bargaining and wage rigidity have one thing in
common: they all include the term

p̄
.
p̄−b

To understand the role of this term it is useful to

think of the gains from market activity p̄ − b as the driving force of the model. Then

elasticity of this driving force with respect to productivity. If b is close to p̄, then even small

Thus even if the model does not strongly amplify fluctuations in p̄ − b it could still generate
large labor market fluctuations for sufficiently large b. In Shimer’s calibration

Wage Determination under Asymmetric Information

We now consider classic models of bargaining with incomplete information, that have been
studied very extensively. We want to check whether these models exhibit the properties, such
as Increasing worker rents, under which the labor market volatility bounds apply. These are
comparative statics properties of equilibrium outcomes of the bargaining game. Comparative
statics are meaningful only when the equilibrium prediction is unique. Thus, we focus our
attention on bargaining protocols for which the literature has established outcome uniqueness,
27

possibly subject to appropriate refinements: one-sided offers with and without commitment
to the offer, strategic bargaining with one-sided asymmetric information, and the constrained
efficient allocation maximizing expected gains from trade. In each case, the comparative
statics properties of the unique equilibrium outcome are unknown, so we have to derive them
anew.
There is an additional reason to focus on unique outcomes. If the bargaining game has
multiple outcomes, then this could be exploited to generate amplification by selecting an
outcome favorable to firms in booms and an outcome favorable to workers in recessions.
However, asymmetric information is not needed to do this. In fact, Hall (2005) exploits
multiplicity in this way to provide a foundation for wage rigidity in the model with symmetric
information. He assumes that the wage is set through a double auction. The key feature of
the double auction under symmetric information environment is that any split of the gains
from trade is an equilibrium. Thus one can select the rigid wage as the equilibrium for all
combinations of p and n, as long as this wage is always in the bargaining set [n, p]. Since
multiplicity can be used to generate the observed amount of volatility even under symmetric
information, the only interesting question is whether models with asymmetric information are
capable of doing so without exploiting multiplicity. Hence our focus on bargaining protocols
with unique outcomes.
In our setting, private information concerns the idiosyncratic productivity component of
the match, y, and amenity value for the worker, z. The distributions FY and FZ have support
[y, ȳ] and [z, z̄], respectively, with y, z, ȳ, z̄ ∈ R̄. We now introduce a standard technical
assumption about private information.
Assumption 1. (Monotone Virtual Valuations) The “virtual valuations” y −
and z −

1−FZ (z)
FZ′ (z)

1−FY (y)
FY′ (y)

are strictly increasing and continuously differentiable on [y, ȳ] and [z, z̄], re-

spectively.
For each of the rent-sharing models that we examine, we proceed as follows: we show that
Condition 1 (c) holds, and then that expected rents are a function of p and n only through
their difference p − n, with G ′ (p − n) ≥ 0 and J ′ (p − n) ≥ 0. This is all that we need for the
first bound to apply. In fact, it implies that
∂G
∂G
= G ′ (p − n) = −

∂n
28

which implies Increasing worker rents and thereby Condition 1 (a). It also implies
−

∂J
= J ′ (p − n) ≥ 0
∂n

which is Condition 1 (b). For the second bound, we also verify Condition 2 directly.

4.1

Monopoly

First, we consider the simplest game in which the privately uninformed party makes a takeit-or-leave-it offer to the informed party. This is the model suggested by Shimer (2005) in
his conjecture that asymmetric information may generate amplification. In this model, the
relationship ends if the informed party rejects the offer. In other words, the uninformed party
can commit not to make another offer if its first offer is rejected. This game has a unique
equilibrium, which is constrained ex ante efficient in the sense that the offer-making party’s
welfare cannot be improved further given information asymmetry (Satterthwaite and Williams
(1989)). Yet, it does not maximize ex ante gains from trade, due to the monopoly distortion.
We analyze separately the two cases of unilateral wage offer by the firm and wage request
by the worker, because the properties used to derive the second bound are not symmetric for
firms and workers.
Take-It-or-Leave-It Wage Offer by the Firm. A firm of type y offers a wage wM to the
job applicant, who is then indifferent between accepting and rejecting it to stay unemployed
when his amenity value is exactly zM = n − wM . If z ≥ zM , and the offer is accepted, an event
with chance 1 − FZ (zM ), the firm earns flow profits p + y − wM = p − n + y + zM . Equivalently,
the firm chooses the threshold zM , rather than the wage wM , to maximize the PDV of:
[1 − FZ (zM )](p − n + y + zM ).

(9)

The well-known first order condition is
p − n + y + zM =

1 − FZ (zM )
.
FZ′ (zM )

(10)

The left hand side is the gain from trading with an additional worker. However, if the firm
wants to trade with more workers, it has to pay higher informational rents to the workers
(types, values of z) it is already trading with. The right hand side gives the number of
workers that receive higher rents relative to the number of workers gained from reducing zM .
29

If (10) has an interior solution zM (p−n+y), by Assumption 1, this is unique, differentiable,
and the global maximizer. Assumption 1 allows for finite lower and upper bounds, so zM (p −
n + y) could be at a corner, equal to the lower bound z (the offer is accepted for sure) if
p − n + y + z ≥ [FZ′ (z)]−1 , that is if the gain from trading with more workers always outweighs
the cost of higher informational rents, and equal to the upper bound z̄ (the offer is rejected
for sure) if p − n + y + z̄ ≤ 0. One may expect that corner solutions may generate sufficient
wage rigidity to escape the bounds. We will show that this is not the case.
From acceptance of its offer, the firm learns that the type of the worker is at least zM (p −
n + y). Although it has obtained this information, the firm would not want to revise its wage
offer if it were allowed to do so.17 Thus the key assumption regarding commitment is not that
the firm can commit not to make a lower wage offer after acceptance, but that it can commit
not to make a higher wage offer after being rejected.
It is now straightforward to map this model of wage determination into the notation of
Section 2, and check that it satisfies the properties there introduced:
z − zM (p − n + y)
,
r+δ
p − n + y + zM (p − n + y)
,
J(y, z, p, n) = x(y, z, p − n)
r+δ

G(y, z, p, n) = x(y, z, p − n)

x(y, z, p − n) = I {z ≥ zM (p − n + y)} .

(11)

The trade decision x depends on p and n only through their difference p−n. Moreover, the
same is true for the functions G and J and for their unconditional counterparts, that we can
write as ξ(p − n), G(p − n) and J (p − n) from now on. Inspecting the firm’s objective in (9),
an increase in p − n + y raises the marginal gain from trade by lowering the threshold zM . By
a monotone comparative statics argument, or by the implicit function theorem, zM (p − n + y)
is weakly decreasing (and strictly so over the range where the solution is interior). Consulting
Equation (11), this implies that x(y, z, p−n) is non-decreasing in both y and z, and Condition
1 (c) is verified. As discussed earlier, for the first bound we just need G ′ (p − n), J ′ (p − n) ≥ 0.
Define the worker’s average gains from trading with a firm of type y:
Z z̄
(r + δ)G(p − n|y) ≡
[z − zM (p − n + y)] dFZ (z).
zM (p−n+y)

17

Formally, the objective of the firm facing the distribution of worker types truncated at zM (p − n + y) is

given by p − n + y + zM for zM ≤ zM (p − n + y) and

1−FZ (zM )
1−FZ (zM (p−n+y)) (p − n + y + zM )

The unique maximizer is still zM (p − n + y).

30

for zM ≥ zM (p − n + y).

This function is differentiable everywhere, including at the two threshold values of y where
the first order condition (10) holds with equality for the corners z and z̄, with
′
(r + δ)G ′ (p − n|y) = −zM
(p − n + y)[FZ (zM (p − n + y))] ≥ 0.
′
The firm expands the range of workers it is trading with by −zM
(p−n+y), so the informational

rents of all worker types that it is already trading with have to increase by exactly this amount.
′
If zM (p − n + y) is at a corner z or z̄, clearly zM
(p − n + y) = 0 and the inequality still applies.
R
By definition G(p − n) = G(p − n|y)dFY (y), so that
Z
′
G (p − n) = G ′ (p − n|y)dFY (y) ≥ 0.

For the firm, the maximized value for type y is
(r + δ)J (p − n|y) = [1 − FZ (zM (p − n + y)) [p − n + y + zM (p − n + y)] .
Differentiation yields
(r + δ)J ′ (p − n|y) = 1 − FZ (zM (p − n + y)).
If the firm is at a corner this follows immediately, as zM (p − n + y) does not respond to a
change in p − n. If the solution to the firm’s problem is interior, this relationship follows from
the envelope theorem. Since the threshold zM is chosen optimally, the firm cannot gain at
the margin from adjusting the threshold, so the benefit from an increase in p − n is just the
direct effect on the rents that the firm earns from the workers that it is already trading with.
It follows that J (p − n|y) is continuously differentiable, and differentiation under the integral
sign yields

(r + δ)J ′ (p − n|y)dFY (y)

This also establishes that Condition 2 holds with equality. Recall our discussion that Condition
2 is innocuous if trade is ex post efficient, because in this case the envelope theorem implies

We summarize these results in the following:
31

Proposition 3. Under Assumption 1 the model of wage determination through a take-itor-leave-it offer by the firm to a privately informed worker satisfies Conditions 1 and 2 and
Increasing worker rents. Thus, both labor market volatility bounds of Propositions 1 and 2
apply.
Take-It-or-Leave-It Wage Request by the Worker. By symmetry with the case that
we just analyzed, when the worker makes a take-it-or-leave-it wage request from the firm,
Condition 1 is satisfied and worker rents are Increasing. These are all the properties needed
to apply the weak bound of Proposition 1.
To apply the strong bound, we cannot invoke symmetry with the previous case: there, we
only established that the rents of the offer-making party satisfy Condition 2, while now the
firm is at the receiving end of the offer. Using notation symmetric to the firm offer model, in
the worker request model

(r + δ)J ′ (p − n|z) = −yM

(12)

at points of differentiability of yM (p − n + z), the threshold productivity level chosen by
the worker with amenity value z. Only firm types that the worker has already been trading
with experience an increase in their informational rent, which is why the probability of trade
1 − FY (yM (p − n + z)) appears in Equation (12). How large the increase in the informational
rent is for these firm types depends on how many more firm types the worker wants to trade
′
with, that is, on the drop in the threshold −yM
(p − n + z). If the worker reduces the request

and thus the feasible productivity threshold substantially, then the firm will experience a large
increase in its informational rents. Now suppose that the worker reduces the threshold less

than one for one with an increase in p − n, that is −yM
(p − n + z) ≤ 1. Then

enough for Condition 2. The following strengthening of the second part of Assumption 1
′
suffices for −yM
≤ 1.

Assumption 2. (Monotone Hazard Rate) The hazard rate
and continuously differentiable on [y, ȳ].
32

FY′ (y)

is weakly increasing

To understand the role of a monotone hazard rate, consult the worker’s first order condition
for an optimal wage request to the firm:
p − n + yM + z =

1 − FY (yM )
.
FY′ (yM )

If in response to an increase in p − n the worker reduced yM one for one, then the left hand
side, which is the marginal benefit from trading with another firm type, would be unchanged.
However, under Assumption 2 the worker would end up at a point with a lower hazard rate,
that is the loss of trade associated with a more aggressive wage request would be smaller
relative to the number of firms that would pay the higher wage. It follows that it is optimal
to reduce the threshold less than one for one.
Thus we obtain the following:
Proposition 4. Under Assumption 1 the model of wage determination through a take-it-orleave-it request by the worker to a privately informed firm satisfies Condition 1 and Increasing
worker rents. Thus, the weak labor market volatility bound of Proposition 1 applies. If Assumption 1 is strengthened to Assumption 2, then this model also satisfies Condition 2 and
the strong volatility bound of Proposition 2 also applies.
Kennan (2006) also considers the model with take-it-or-leave-it offers, and he is able to
generate large fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies. As discussed in the introduction,
his approach exploits asymmetric information in a different way from what we consider in this
paper. We ask how the presence of asymmetric information changes the response of the labor
market to an increase in aggregate labor productivity, but the extent of private information
itself is acyclical. In contrast, in Kennan (2006) exogenous fluctuations in the shape of the
distribution of types are the key driving force of labor market fluctuations. Specifically, he
assumes that the match specific productivity component can be either high or low, and that
the high value is more likely in booms. He assumes that parameters are such that pooling
occurs in both booms and recessions: workers always request the wage that makes the low
firm type indifferent. Since the value of unemployment is procyclical, it follows that worker
rents are countercyclical.18
18

Translated into our notation, in Kennan (2006) both p and FY vary over the cycle. It is straightforward

to decompose labor market volatility into three sources: p, FY , and an interaction term. In his calibration

33

In Section 3.2 we demonstrated that the strong labor market volatility bound can be
attained by the model of complete rent rigidity. We now show that there exist beliefs such
that the monopoly model also attains the bound.
Attaining the Strong Bound in Firm Offer Monopoly. The idea is to construct beliefs
such that the monopoly model maps exactly into the model of complete rent rigidity, that is
the worker receives a fixed flow rent g > 0. For simplicity there is no heterogeneity on the firm
side, that is FY is degenerate. Let w = b+ r+δ+f
g. As in the model with complete rent rigidity,
r+δ
this turns out to be the equilibrium annuity value of wages. Let j = p − w = p − b −

which will be the equilibrium value of profits. Consider beliefs

with support [z, z̄] where the lower bound is z = −g and the upper bound is chosen to insure
R z̄
a zero mean, that is it is the unique positive solution to the equation z zFZ (dz) = 0. We will

show that in steady state the firm trades with all worker types. Steady state flow rents are
p − n = g + j. More importantly, we show that trading with all worker types remains optimal
in response to a productivity shock, which in turn implies G ′ (g + j) = 0. Thus this example
maps exactly into the model of complete rent rigidity.
First note that if the firm chooses to trade with all worker types, then flow worker rents
are

(z − z̄)dFZ (z) = −z = g.

Furthermore, if flow worker rents are g, then equilibrium condition (3) implies that in equilibrium p − n = g + j. Thus it remains to show that it is indeed optimal for the firm to choose
the lower bound z for a neighborhood around p − n = g + j. Evaluating the objective of the
firm at p − n = g + j yields
(1 − FZ (z))(p − n + z) = (1 − FZ (z))(z + g + j) =

While monopoly can attain the bound for some beliefs, this is not to say that it generically
leads to amplification vis-a-vis Nash bargaining. It is easy to construct beliefs such that the
fluctuations in FY alone generate about 85 percent of observed volatility in the v-u ratio, while the contribution
of p and of the interaction term are small.

34

response of the labor market to a productivity shock is muted. Indeed, in his conjecture
Shimer (2005) merely argues that the model breaks the direct link between labor productivity
and the v-u ratio by making the response to a productivity shock a function of the hazard
rate. Thus at least the model adds may degrees of freedom that one may expect should
enable the model to match observed volatility. Our results imply that this is not the case:
the degrees of freedom are not enough to generate amplification in excess of the strong labor
market volatility bound. Moreover, if one chooses the distribution of beliefs to maximize
amplification, one obtains precisely complete rent rigidity.

4.2

Strategic Bargaining with One-Sided Private Information

We now move away from the case of extreme commitment to a (take-it-or-leave-it) offer, and
towards repeated, strategic bargaining. The theory of sequential non-cooperative bargaining
with private information has produced compelling predictions only for the case of one-sided
asymmetric information, that we address first. In the two-sided case, the wealth of Bayesian
equilibria makes alternating-offer games problematic as tools of analysis, despite the realism
of the setup. In that case, we will consider the unique allocation that maximizes expected
gains from trade through a mediator.
We focus on some popular and natural extensive forms of the bargaining game. In the
previous subsection we analyzed the case of a unilateral offer with commitment to a privately
informed party. In that case, the private information of the offer-making party is irrelevant,
so that solution applies both to one-sided and two-sided asymmetric information. We showed
that our bounds apply. Therefore, we now assume that parties cannot commit to walk away
when the opponent declines its offer, but they can commit to their offer should it be accepted.
The only change in the environment is that information is private only on one side. To
fix ideas, assume that the firm is uninformed about z but the worker observes y. The parties
then enter a bargaining phase. The firm (uninformed party) makes the first wage offer w. If
this is accepted, from then until the (exogenous) end of the match the firm has flow profits
p+y −w, the worker has flow payoffs w +z −n, the total surplus is p+y +z −n. If negotiations
end unsuccessfully, the firm obtains zero and the worker obtains a flow value n. Fix numbers
β ∈ [0, 1], ρwork ≥ 0, ρf irm ≥ 0. If the first offer is declined, negotiations break down with

35

chance 1 − e−(1−β)∆ , continue with chance e−(1−β)∆ and, after a delay ∆ and with discounting
cost e−ρf irm ∆ , the worker makes a new wage request. Again, if this is declined by the firm,
negotiations break down with chance 1 − e−β∆ and continue with complementary probability,
in which case payoffs are further discounted at rate e−ρwork ∆ . Notice then that the discount
rate after a firm offer is declined is effectively equal to 1 − β + ρf irm , and after a worker offer is
declined it equals β + ρwork . We study Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibria (PBE) when ∆ → 0.
This model nests several well-known models as special cases. First, let the uninformed
party i ∈ {work, f irm} make the first offer. If the discount rate ρi that applies after the first
offer is infinite, we are back to the previous case of monopoly with commitment. Therefore,
from now on we assume ρi < ∞. We analyze first the simpler case where repeated offers are
effectively one-sided.
Coase Conjecture. Suppose again for illustration that the firm is uninformed and β =
ρwork = 0 ≤ ρf irm < ∞. In this case, any request by the worker can be rejected at no cost by
the firm, because negotiations continue for sure and there is no discounting after a worker’s
request is declined, but declining a firm’s offer implies an efficiency loss (1 − β > 0). Thus,
offers are effectively one-sided. This is the case of a monopolist (firm) selling a durable good
(job) to a buyer (worker) who has private information about his own valuation (z) for the job.
The firm (uninformed) makes the first offer. As is well-known, the unique PBE as ∆ → 0
dictates that negotiations end immediately and the worker extracts all rents from the firm,
the Coase Conjecture (Gul and Wilson (1986)). We now examine the properties of this model
of wage determination. We have two subcases.
In the Gap case the firm’s draw of match productivity y is such that there are gains from
trade for sure, p + y + z − n > 0. Then the sequential equilibrium wage of the subgame
following the observation of y is w(p, n, y) = n − z < p + y, all worker types accept if payoffs
are w + z − n = z − z > 0, the firm makes profits p + y − w = p − n + y + z > 0. In the
No-Gap case, given productivity y, gains from trade exist only for some worker types z, such
that p + y + z − n ≤ 0 < p + y + z̄ − n. Then, the unique equilibrium satisfying a stationarity
condition on strategies has the following outcome. The wage offer w(p, n, y) = p+y is accepted
immediately, the firm is left with nothing, workers with z ≥ n − (p + y) accept and obtain
rents p + y + z − n, the other worker types decline.
36

Trade is ex post efficient, so the ex ante probability of trade is simply ξ(p − n) = Pr(p −
n + y + z ≥ 0) and Condition 1 (c) is verified. Notice that once again not only the trade
decision but also the split of rents depends on p and n only through their difference p − n.
We are left to verify G ′ , J ′ ≥ 0. The firm’s rents are
(r + δ)J (p − n) = Ey,z [p + y − w(p, n, y)] =

Z

ȳ

(p − n + y + z) dFY (y)

n−p−z

with
(r + δ)J ′ (p − n) = 1 − FY (n − p − z) ∈ [0, ξ(p − n)]
implying Conditions 1 (b) and 2. The fact that trade is ex post efficient implies that (r +
δ)(G ′ + J ′ ) = ξ, so it immediately follows that (r + δ)G ′ ∈ [0, ξ]. Therefore, the worker and
firm informational rents have symmetric properties, and we can swap their roles. These facts
establish:
Proposition 5. Under Assumption 1 the “Coase Conjecture” model of wage determination
through quickly repeated unilateral offers by the uninformed party in stationary strategies satisfies Conditions 1 and 2 and Increasing worker rents. Thus, the labor market volatility bounds
of Propositions 1 and 2 apply.
Menzio (2005b) proposes a model of wage determination that delivers the same implications
as the Coase conjecture, albeit through a different mechanism. In his model workers are
uninformed. As under the Coase conjecture, the wage requested by the worker in equilibrium
is given by the productivity of the lowest firm type: w = p + y. The mechanism is as follows.
The firm employs many workers. If the firm grants a wage in excess of p + y to one worker,
then all its other employees learn that the firm’s type is higher than y, and they successfully
request wage increases. This spillover of information enables the firm to reject wage requests
in excess of p + y. As the implied wage is the same as under the Coase conjecture, it follows
that the labor market volatility bounds apply to this model of wage determination as well, as
long as private information is acyclical as it is assumed to be here. Menzio uses this model to
generate rigid wages as follows. He assumes that the lower bound of the distribution of firm
productivity is acyclical. Translated into our notation, p + y remains constant over the cycle.
As aggregate labor productivity is higher in booms while the lower bound is acyclical, it must
be that the shape of the distribution FY is changing over the cycle. Thus Menzio’s approach
37

is similar to Kennan (2006) in the sense that it relies on exogenous fluctuations in the shape
of the distribution of types in order to generate large labor market fluctuations.
Alternating Offers. Now suppose that β ∈ (0, 1), so declining an offer can always lead to
a breakdown in negotiations, and ρf irm = ρwork = r ≥ 0. These assumptions provide some
physical commitment to parties to walk away after receiving a negative answer to an offer, and
enhance the bargaining power of the uninformed party. We illustrate equilibrium predictions
drawing from Grossman and Perry (1986), Gul and Sonnenschein (1988), and Menzio (2005a).
In this game, Stationarity of equilibrium strategies is not sufficient to pin down a unique
PBE, and one needs to impose also a Monotonicity requirement on beliefs. Then, the unique
PBE is similar to the Coase conjecture, with the only twist that β measures the bargaining
power of the worker. That is, suppose now (for the sake of variety) that the firm is privately
informed about y, while z is common knowledge and the worker of type z makes the first
wage request. Then, in the Gap case, p+y+z − n > 0, the unique PBE wage first requested
by the worker of type z (and accepted by all firms) is w(p, n, z) = β(p+y) + (1 − β)(n − z)
and the worker obtains payoff z − n + w = β(p+y+z − n). That is, the wage must reflect
the worker’s valuation because with some probability (decreasing in β): negotiations break
down, the firm does not get its turn to counteroffer and it loses everything. This makes the
firm more willing to accept a high wage requests, the more so the higher β. The firm earns
p + y − w(p, n, z) = y − βy + (1 − β)(p − n + z). In the No-Gap case, the worker requests
w(p, n, z) = β(p + n − p − z)+ (1 − β)(n − z) = n − z and is left with zero payoffs, the firm
accepts if y ≥ n − p − z and earns p + y − w(p, n, z) = p + y − n + z. So the outcome is different
from that of one-sided repeated offers only in the Gap case.
The chance of trading ξ(p−n) is the same as in the previous model, so it satisfies Condition
1 (c), and

(0, ξ(p − n)). Again, these are the desired properties and are symmetric. We conclude:

Proposition 6. Under Assumption 1 the model of wage determination through quickly repeated alternating offers between an uninformed and an informed party, in stationary strategies and monotone beliefs, satisfies Conditions 1 and 2 and Increasing worker rents. Thus,
both labor market volatility bounds of Propositions 1 and 2 apply.

Two-Sided Private Information: Constrained Efficient Allocation

The theory of strategic bargaining in the presence of bilateral asymmetric information, whether
with one-sided or alternating offers, has not produced compelling (unique) predictions based
on the Perfect Bayes Nash equilibrium notion even after restricting the space of strategies
by requirements such as stationarity of strategies and monotonicity of beliefs. The wealth of
reasonable off-equilibrium beliefs simply sustains many robust equilibria, even after applying
additional refinements.
We then turn to the constrained efficient allocation that maximizes expected gains from
trade, as in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983), henceforth MS83. This corresponds to the
efficient allocation where both parties receive equal weight in the welfare function. Parties have
access to a mediator, who receives announcements about the draws of private information, y
and z, and recommends a binding allocation: a trading decision and a wage. After learning
their type, parties are willing to participate in the mechanism and truthfully reveal their
types. In this wage negotiation context, the mediator enforcing the rules of the game can be
thought of as an arbitrator of a labor dispute. The resulting constrained efficient allocation
can be implemented with a multiplicity of payment functions, but importantly it produces a
unique sharing of expected rents. This allocation is of great interest for its uniqueness, which
allows us to apply our test, and for two additional reasons: it features the maximal expected
gains from trade in the equilibrium of any unmediated bargaining game and, for some classes
of belief distributions, it can be implemented through a sealed-bid double auction. In this
subsection, we show that our weak bound from Proposition 1 applies to this allocation too.
We have not been able to either establish or disprove Condition 2 and the strong bound.
The Mechanism Design Problem. A mediator, or principal, receives reports ŷ and ẑ by
the two parties and enforces a probability of trade x(ŷ, ẑ, p, n) and a wage w(ŷ, ẑ, p, n) so as
39

to maximize the sum of expected values to the two parties. The reports are a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium of this optimal mechanism. That is, the efficient mechanism is a direct revelation
game whose Bayesian Nash equilibrium produces the constrained efficient allocation.
Given a pair of reports ŷ, ẑ and realizations y, z, the firm’s value is
(r + δ)J(ŷ, ẑ, y, p, n) = p + y − w(ŷ, ẑ, p, n)
and the worker’s value is

(r + δ)W (ŷ, ẑ, z, p, n) = z + w(ŷ, ẑ, p, n) + δU = z + w(ŷ, ẑ, p, n) + δ .

Notice that this is not a constrained efficient allocation for society: here parties take the
outside option n = rU as given, and just mind the division of rents. The objective function is
independent of the wage w, which only plays the role of a transfer function to induce parties to
truthfully reveal their valuations, thus only enters the IC and IR constraints. In the appendix
we prove:

Corner solutions are encompassed: if y ∗ (z) <y for some worker type z, this and all higher
types z ′ > z who like the job even better than z are sure to trade. Conversely if y ∗ (z) > ȳ for
some worker type z, this and all lower types z ′ < z who like the job even less than z are sure
not to trade. Notice that the ex post efficient trading rule, trade iff y + p − n + z ≥ 0, holds
if and only if the constraint is not binding, or µ = 0. This happens in the Gap case, when
p − n is large enough that the supports of p + y and z − n are disjoint.
We can also state the constrained efficient trading rule in terms of the worker’s private
value: trade occurs iff z ≥ z ∗ (y, p − n) = y ∗−1 (y, p − n). Either way, the higher the valuation
a party has for the match, the more likely she expects trade to be. By the implicit function
theorem, these cutoff functions y ∗ and z ∗ are also differentiable in p − n. We now move to
verify the conditions stated at the beginning of this Section 4.
Expected Rents. As shown in MS83, the expected value to each party, unconditional on
trade but conditional on private information, can be written as

Notice that G ∗ (z|p, n) is increasing in z and J ∗ (y|p, n) is increasing in y, so the IR constraints
G ∗ (z|p, n) ≥ 0 and J ∗ (y|p, n) ≥ 0 for each type of worker and firm are satisfied if they are for
the lowest types y and z. By Theorem 2 in MS83, these are binding at the optimum:
G ∗ (p, n|z) = J ∗ (p, n|y) = 0.

41

Taking expectations w.r. to private information, we obtain the expected values to each party
unconditional on trade and on private information. In the second and fourth equalities we

Notice the analogy with the monopoly model: a trading party enjoys expected rents equal to
the expected difference between its own valuation and the minimum acceptable valuation for
trade.
These rents are uniquely defined by the trading rule y ∗ , that we proved to uniquely exist,
and do not depend on the payment function w∗ , which is defined residually. Therefore, G ∗ and
J ∗ are uniquely defined as functions of p − n only.
Verifying the Conditions. Lemma 7 immediately implies Condition 1 (c). In the Appendix, we prove the key result:
Lemma 8. G ∗′ (p − n) ≥ 0.
Since the roles of the worker and the firm in the mechanism design problem are symmetric,
as long as both distributions of types satisfy Assumption 1, we also obtain J ∗′ (p − n) ≥ 0.
Intuitively, when the average gains from trade p − n rise, the mediator optimally re-adjusts
his mechanism so as to spread the benefits across both parties. One might expect that, in
situations where private information is lopsided and the IC constraint is much more binding for
one party, larger gains from trade p−n might be used by the mediator to relax that constraint
42

and to greatly increase the chance of trade. This may require reducing the expected payoffs
to the other party. Lemma 8 shows that this is impossible. Under bilateral asymmetric
information satisfying Assumption 1, labor market fluctuations of the empirically observed
magnitude are a symptom of wage-setting institutions that, albeit not necessarily privately
inefficient in the Pareto sense, do not fully exploit all possible gains from trade.
Proposition 9. Under bilateral asymmetric information satisfying Assumption 1, the constrained efficient model of wage determination, in which a mediator maximizes ex ante expected
gains from trade, satisfies Condition 1 and Increasing worker rents. Therefore, the labor market volatility bound of Proposition 1 applies.

4.4

Summary

There are essentially two kinds of allocations that emerge in the games that we considered.
Either one party is left with no rents, as in the Coase conjecture, or an interior trading
cutoff on private information is chosen to maximize the rents of one or both parties, as in
the models of take-it-or-leave-it offers and the constrained efficient allocation. In the former
case, our conditions apply trivially. In the latter, they follow in part from an implication of
optimality, the envelope theorem.
The various models that we analyzed suggest a connection between private (in)efficiency
of wage setting and labor market volatility. To this purpose, it is useful to describe the Pareto
frontier under bilateral asymmetric information, interim participation and incentive compatibility constraints. Barring transfers between parties at the ex ante stage, the constrained
efficient allocation is just one point on this frontier, right in the middle of it where both
parties receive equal weights. The extreme points of the frontier correspond to take-it-orleave-it offers, where one party obtains all the weight. Although the entire frontier of this
trading problem has not been fully characterized, in these three benchmark cases (points on
the frontier) either one or both of our bounds apply. We conjecture that all the allocations
on the frontier, for any given Pareto weights that do not change with aggregate productivity
p, satisfy our conditions for volatility bounds. Verifying this conjecture is a task for future
research. Some of the strategic bargaining models that we considered feature inefficiency but
no amplification, so inefficiency in wage setting may be necessary but is certainly not sufficient
43

for amplification of aggregate labor productivity shocks.
For belief distributions that give rise to linear “virtual valuations” (as defined in Assumption 1) the unique constrained efficient allocation can be implemented through a sealed-bid
double auction (Satterthwaite and Williams 1989), the same mechanism as in Hall (2005), but
cannot provide the desired amplification. Yet, the double auction with two-sided asymmetric
information has multiple equilibria that are privately Pareto undominated, although they do
not maximize average gains from trade. Therefore, Hall’s mechanism, based on an appropriate
selection from the set of Pareto undominated equilibria, might still deliver the desired wage
rigidity and amplification with private information. Verifying this conjecture is difficult, for
two reasons. First, any amount of asymmetric information restricts the equilibrium set of the
double-auction, relative to the latitude exploited by Hall in the complete information case.
Second, the literature has not found a complete characterization of this equilibrium set. So
we leave also this conjecture for future research.

Transitory Aggregate Productivity Shocks

We have justified our focus on permanent productivity shocks claiming that labor market
volatility is even smaller if shocks are transitory. Thus the labor market volatility bounds
should still apply if shocks are not fully permanent. In this section we show that this is the
case, generalizing the labor market volatility bounds to an economy that switches between a
high state pH and a low state pL of aggregate labor productivity. Transitions from the high
state to the low state occur at rate λL , reverse transitions at rate λH . As an illustration
we generalize the firm offer monopoly model to this environment and demonstrate that the
bounds apply.

for the opportunity cost of the worker.19 A model of wage determination is now a sextuple
{GH , GL , J H , J L , xH , xL } where for instance GH (y, z, pH , pL , nH , nL ) is the initial worker rent
from a match formed in a high aggregate state with idiosyncratic productivity component y
and amenity value z. Worker rents of matches created in the high state depend on pL and nL
because labor productivity is no longer completely persistent and the match may eventually
find itself in the low state. The probability of trade is now a more complicated object. Let
h(s) denote the history of a match of age s. It includes the history of the aggregate state
and the history of trade within the match between match formation and the time at which
it reaches age s. Then xH (y, z, pH , nH , pL , nL , h(s)) denotes the probability of trade at age
s after history h(s). The sum GH + J H is the joint present value of the match induced by
the trade probability xH . The ex ante functions G H , G L , J H , J L are defined analogously to
Equation (1). Thus G H (pH , nH , pL , nL ) is the ex ante worker rent of a match created in the
high aggregate state. We make the natural assumption that for identical states pH = pL and
nH = nL the model maps into the case we already studied: rents do not depend on the state
in which the match is created and the probability of trade is independent of history, so we
can define:
G(y, z, p, n) ≡ GH (y, z, p, n, p, n) = GL (y, z, p, n, p, n),
J(y, z, p, n) ≡ J H (y, z, p, n, p, n) = J L (y, z, p, n, p, n),

(17)

x(y, z, p, n) ≡ xH (y, z, p, n, p, n, h(s)) = xL (y, z, p, n, p, n, h(s)),
and Equation (1) yields the corresponding ex ante functions G, J and ξ.
For the case of permanent shocks we derived upper bounds on the elasticity of the v-u ratio
with respect to aggregate labor productivity p. Analogously, here we derive upper bounds on
the relative coefficient of variation of the v-u ratio and aggregate labor productivity
the two state model the coefficient of variation for the v-u ratio can be written as

In standard notation Equation (16) for the high state reads

Thus here nH = rU H − λL (U L − U H ) and by symmetry nL = rU L − λH (U H − U L ).

As before

G H (pH , nH , pL , nL ) = W H (pH , nH , pL , nL ) − U H where W H (pH , nH , pL , nL ) is the utility of a worker in
a job created in the high state.

Next we

provide the natural generalization of Condition 1 for this environment.
Condition 1′ . The model of wage determination {GH , GL , J H , J L , xH , xL } satisfies three
properties:
(a) The partial effect of aggregate labor productivity in the high state pH on the difference
in worker rents across states is non-negative
∂G H

(c) The trade probabilities xH and xL depend on pH and nH only through their difference
pH − nH , on pL and nL only through their difference pL − nL , and are weakly increasing
in both match-specific outcomes, the firm’s idiosyncratic productivity y and the worker’s
amenity value for the job z.
To see that this is a generalization of Condition 1, consider for instance part (a). Suppose
productivity shocks are permanent. Then

∂G L
∂pH

= 0: productivity in the high state is irrelevant

for rents in the low state as the low state lasts forever. Moreover

∂G H

because the high

state lasts forever. Thus Condition 1′ (a) reduces to Condition 1 (a) if productivity shocks
are permanent.

Our approach to deriving the bounds in this setting is as follows. As before we consider

productivity p. That is, the two productivity values pH , pL must satisfy

that is the bounds apply not only if λH and λL are close to zero, but for any values of λH and
λL .
First we note a fact that will be convenient in the linearization. In what follows all
derivatives are evaluated at (p, n, p, n) where n is the steady state opportunity cost of the
worker induced by productivity p. Identity (17) yields

we obtain

Monopoly

We consider take-it-or-leave-it offers by the firm and analyze the case without firm heterogeneity for simplicity. Again the firm has the power to commit not to make further offers to
workers that have rejected an offer. It does not matter whether the firm also can commit not
to make further offer to workers who accepted an offer. Thus we could assume that the firm
makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer of a contract which specifies wage payments conditional on the
history of the aggregate state, and has the ability to commit to this contract. Or we could let
the firm change the wage whenever it finds it optimal to do so (but importantly, never makes
a follow up offer to workers who reject a wage change). Both cases lead to the same outcome,
which takes the following form. First consider a match created in the low state. Optimal firm
offers yield the firm rent
(r + δ)J L (pH , nH , pL , nL ) =




· max (r + δ + λL )(1 − FZ (z)) pL − nL + z + λH (1 − FZ (z)) pH − nH + z .
z

To understand this expression, recall that in the absence of transitions between the two states,
the firm would like to trade with more worker types in the high state. Here the firm starts in
the low state, but expects the match to be in the high state for part of its duration. In this
situation it is not optimal to hire workers only up to the point where profits in the low state

(1 − FZ (z)) pL − nL + z are maximized, because this constrains the set of worker types the

firm can trade with once the boom comes. This consideration leads to a kind of labor hoarding:
48

L
the cutoff chosen by the firm, denoted by zM
(pH − nH , pL − nL ), strikes a balance between

the time the match spends in the two states, which is captured by the weights r + δ + λL and
λH .
The situation is somewhat different for a match created in the high state. The reason is
that hiring many worker types does not put a binding constraint on the set of worker types
the firm wants to trade with once the slump comes, because in the slump the firm actually
wants to shed worker types. Thus when a match is created in a boom, it is optimal to hire

worker types up to the point where profits in the high state (1 − FZ (z)) pH − nH + z are

maximized. Let zM (pH −nH ) denote the corresponding cutoff. Once the match enters a slump

for the first time, it is essentially the same as a match created in the slump, and it is optimal
L
to shed workers below the threshold zM
(pH − nH , pL − nL ). Thus the firm rent is given by

Having derived firm and worker rents for this model of wage determination, we now show
that both the weak and the strong bound apply. Condition 1′ (c) is clearly satisfied, as trade
follows a cutoff rule, and the cutoffs depend on pH , nH , pL and nL only trough the differences
pH − nH and pL − nL . Next we verify Condition 1′ (b) along with Condition 2′ . We have

and it follows that worker rents are Increasing.
Proposition 3′ . Under Assumption 1 the model of wage determination through a take-it-orleave-it offer by the firm to a privately informed worker satisfies Conditions 1′ and 2′ and
Increasing worker rents. Thus, both labor market volatility bounds of Propositions 1′ and 2′
apply.

Conclusion

In this paper we have made two contributions to the debate on whether modifications to the
model of wage determination allow the search and matching model to generate larger labor
market fluctuations in response to productivity shocks. First, we have shown that models of
50

wage determination that cannot generate countercyclical rents, and thus at best generate rent
rigidity, are subject to labor market volatility bounds which are quantitatively tight. The
extent of amplification generated by rent rigidity is thus quite limited, and quantitatively rent
rigidity is much closer to Nash bargaining than it is to wage rigidity. Second, for a sequence of
classic models of wage determination under asymmetric information we have shown that rents
are not countercyclical. Thus a model with asymmetric information in which merely rents are
rigid cannot be the silver bullet which allows the search and matching model to match the
magnitude of observed fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies. Allowing the model to do
so solely through a modification of wage determination forces one to consider models that can
generate countercyclical rents. On the other hand, rent rigidity can generate a limited but not
insignificant amount of amplification. A full answer to Shimer’s (2005) findings may involve
more than one modification of the baseline model, of which a model of wage determination
with rigid rents could be one.

Appendix: Omitted Proofs

Proof of Lemma 7. To solve this mechanism design problem, we appeal to MS83’s formulation, and map our problem in their framework. Let υ ≡ p+y, ζ ≡ n−z, Φ (ζ) ≡ 1−FZ (n − ζ),
so Φ′ (ζ) dζ = FZ′ (n − ζ) dζ = −FZ′ (z) dz, Γ (υ) ≡ FY (υ − p), so Γ′ (υ) dυ = FY′ (υ − p)dυ =
FY′ (y)dy. Then the efficient mechanism maximizes expected gains from trade subject to IC,
IR and budget balance.

w(υ, ζ̂) − ζ x υ, ζ̂ dΓ (υ) .
[w(υ, ζ) − ζ] x (υ, ζ) dΓ (υ) ≥ max 0,
This is the same formulation as in MS83. We apply their terminology and results. Let the
“virtual types” be
Qf (υ, α) ≡ υ − α

Φ (ζ)
1 − Γ (υ)
and
Q
(ζ,
α)

which are, respectively, increasing in υ and decreasing in ζ by Assumption 1. Then IR, IC
and budget balance are equivalent to
Z Z
[Qf (υ, 1) − Qw (ζ, 1)] x (υ, ζ) dΦ (ζ) dΓ(y) ≥ 0
with equality if there is positive probability of no gains from trade (which we will assume to
avoid trivialities).
Form a Lagrangian
Z Z
{υ − ζ + µ [Qf (υ, 1) − Qw (ζ, 1)]} x (υ, ζ) dΦ (ζ) dΓ(y)

where µ is the multiplier. The FOC is
x∗ (υ, ζ) = I {υ − ζ + µ [ Qf (υ, 1) − Qw (ζ, 1)] > 0} = I {Qf (υ, M ) > Qw (ζ, M )}
where I is the indicator function and
M≡

µ
∈ [0, 1] .
1+µ

This, in particular, implies that trade occurs iff υ ≥ ζ. More precisely, let the trading cutoff
υ ∗ (ζ, M ) solve
Qf (υ ∗ (ζ, M ), M ) = Qw (ζ, M )
so that trade occurs iff υ > υ ∗ (ζ, M ), which is the same as y ≥ y ∗ ≡ υ ∗ − p.
Assumption 1 implies that y ∗ is decreasing in z, and that Qf (., 1) and Qw (., 1) are increasing. Then Qf (υ, M ) and Qw (ζ, M ) are also increasing for every M ∈ [0, 1] (see MS83 who
53

state this without proof; there is a simple proof by contradiction). It follows (MS83 Theorem
2) that an efficient mechanism exists, and the efficient rule is: trade iff υ > υ ∗ (ζ, M ) for a
cutoff function υ ∗ defined implicitly by

Γ′ (υ ∗ (ζ, M ))
Φ (ζ)
Using our definitions, this is (13).
To show uniqueness, proceed by contradiction. Suppose that there exist two distinct
efficient allocations {x∗i }i=1,2 . Given the nature of the optimal rule (trade if υ > υ ∗ (ζ, M ))
these two mechanisms must be associated with two different values of the Lagrange multiplier,
M1 and M2 > M1 . Then M2 > M1 ⇔ υ ∗ (ζ, M2 ) > υ ∗ (ζ, M1 ) , which implies
x∗2 (υ, ζ) = x∗1 (υ, ζ) = 1 for all υ > υ ∗ (ζ, M2 )
x∗1 (υ, ζ) = 1 > 0 = x∗2 (υ, ζ) for all υ ∈ (υ ∗ (ζ, M1 ) , υ ∗ (ζ, M2 )]
x∗1 (υ, ζ) = x∗2 (υ, ζ) = 0 for all υ ≤ υ ∗ (ζ, M1 )
Therefore

so that the second mechanism, associated with the higher Lagrange multiplier, yields a strictly
smaller objective function, and cannot be optimal.

and the analogous expression for z ∗ , which exist by the implicit function theorem.
There are two cases. First suppose that the Lagrange multiplier µ weakly declines in
average gains from trade p − n. Notice that as p − n → ∞ the incentive problem disappears,
and µ eventually vanishes, so this case must occur for a sufficiently high value of p − n. Then
the trading cutoff z ∗ (y, p − n) or y ∗ (z, p − n) strictly declines in p − n. From the above
expression for the rents, it is immediate to show both parties strictly gain. Intuitively, when
µ does not rise with p − n the incentive constraint is no more severe, so trade becomes no less
likely, and the planner still has additional gains from trade to distribute, so both parties gain.
Second, suppose that µ is (locally) strictly increasing in p − n. The IC constraint tightens,
and trading may become less likely. By the envelope theorem, the maximized total expected
gains from trade have derivative

The first step is to show that pH − pL ≤ nH − nL implies θH − θL ≤ 0. According to

≤ 0 it follows immediately from Equation (19) in conjunction with Condition

1′ (b) that θ − θL ≤ 0. Otherwise the same implication follows from (19) together with
Condition 1′ (a) and Procyclical worker rents.
The second step is to consider the case pH −pL > nH −nL . Using Equation (20), Procyclical

Consulting Equation (19), the supposition that worker rents are not Procyclical in conjunction
with θH ≤ θL yields the contradiction that nH ≤ nL .
Proof of Proposition 2′ . Consider the case nH < nL . Given Increasing and thus Procyclical worker rents, it is clear from Equation (19) that this implies θH − θL ≤ 0.
