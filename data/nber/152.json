Toward this end, Section 2 provides a brief and often heuristic summary of the major results of optimal tax theory. Section 3 reports the results of some recent econometric studies of saving and labor supply. Finally, Section 4 outlines the implications of the combined theory and econometric evidence for tax policy.\n\n",
