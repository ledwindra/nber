How Migration Can Change Income Inequality?

ABSTRACT
Motivated by the unique experience of Israel of a supply-side shock of skilled migration, and the
concurrent rise in disposable income inequality, this paper develops a model which can explain
the mechanism through which a supply-side shock of skilled migration can reshape the politicaleconomy balance and the redistributive policies. First, it depresses the incentives for unskilled
migrants to flow in, though they are still free to do so. Second, tax-transfer system becomes less
progressive. Nonetheless, the unskilled native-born may well become better-off, even though they
lose their political clout.

Introduction

Motivation for this paper arises from the unique laboratory-like experience: robust supply-side shock,
triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a concomitant sharp rise in Israel’s income
inequality. To explore how the shock alters immigration patterns, and, at the same time, reshapes the
political-economy balance we develop a stylized political-economy model with free migration.
We flash out the working of important political-economy mechanisms:
First, the influx of skill-immigrants depresses the incentives for unskilled migrants to flow in, though
they are still free to do so. Second, the fiscal burden of redistribution policies diminishes from the
viewpoint of the decisive voter. That is, the influx of skilled labor raises overall productivity of the
labor force; consequently it also raises the tax revenue needed for shouldering a redistribution policy.
However, counteracting this pro-distribution force is the rebalancing of the political coalition, because
the share of the increase in the skilled in the population. Therefore, the emerging decisive voter
reverses pre-existing the redistribution regime, notwithstanding the fall in the fiscal burden. Third,
nonetheless, the unskilled native-born may well become better-off, even though they lose their
political clout.
I.1 Unique Episode
Immigration has been long known to have far and wide reaching economic and social
consequences. These include the labor market, international trade, economic growth, the social and
political structure, etc. (see, e.g., Lucas (2014) for a recent treatise). In Razin, Sadka and Swagel
(2001b) we studied the way immigration may affect policy by reshaping the political balance of
powers. In this paper we focus on how this reshaping affects the economic policy of the receiving
country on income inequality. 1
However, we greatly simplified the structure of the political forces at play and could only
generate a limited degree of change in the political balance of powers.
Unique to Israel, the Law of Return not only enabled free immigration but also grants these
immigrants immediate citizenship and consequently voting rights. Nevertheless, an early study by
Avner (1975) finds that the voting turnout rate of new immigrants had been markedly lower than that
of the established population. This means that immigrants did not fully exercise their voting rights and

state.

3

did not therefore influence the political economy equilibrium in Israel as much as the established
population.
A similar migrant low voting turnout pattern is reported also by Massina (2007) and Bird
(2011) for Western Europe. However, a later study about voting turnout pattern of new immigrants to
Israel in the 2001 elections, conducted by Arian and Shamir (2002) reverse this finding for 2001. The
new immigrants in this study are pre-dominantly from the FSU. Arian and Shamir find no marked
difference in the voting turnout rates between these new immigrants and the established population.
This is indeed a unique feature of the 1989-2001 immigration waves from the FSU. We therefore
focus here on this case.
There is yet another unique feature of the 1989-2001 immigration waves that distinguishes it
from earlier post-state waves. Immigrants came mostly from urban areas, with fairly advanced
education systems. Thus, the skill (education) composition of the immigrants is biased towards high
education levels, relative to the skill (education) composition of the established population. This bias
is reflected in their relatively higher labor income (see Table 1). Their share in the population was
sizable - 14.5%. Their average family size (2.32 standard persons) is lower than the national average
(2.64 standard persons). This indicates a fewer number of dependents. Most important is their higher
education level and consequently their higher labor income. The average number of schooling years
of the new immigrants is 14.0, compared to the national average of only 13.3.

Even more striking is the percentage of the head of the household with a bachelor degree:
41.1% among the new immigrants, compared to a national average of just 29.5%. The higher
education level and the lower family size can presumably explain the income gap: the average labor
income per standard person of the new immigrants is NIS 4,351, compared to a national average of
only NIS 4,139. Noteworthy, this gap exists even though the new immigrants have presumably lower
work seniority than the established population.
The educational achievement figures of the immigrants from the FSU are strikingly
impressive compared to the EU-15. Relying on data from the International Organization for Migration
(IOM) and the OECD, Razin and Sadka (2014) report that only 18% of the stock of immigrants in the
EU-15 in 1990 and 24% in 2000 have tertiary education.
I.3 Organization
Naturally, countries receiving immigrants are typically welfare states, Israel included. Putting
it differently, in a typical welfare state disposable income inequality is significantly lower than the
market income inequality. That is, transfers and the taxes of a typical welfare state serve to reduce
disposable income inequality. Israel is not an outlier in the OECD countries with respect to the
market-triggered (pre-tax-cum-transfer) income inequality. The 1989-2001 immigration sharply
reduced the scope of the welfare state.
We endeavor to study analytically the political economy interactions between immigration
and the welfare state, through majority voting within a rich political economy structure that enables a
variety of formulations of coalition. Specifically, we have in mind the wave of immigration from the
FSU to Israel in 1989-2001.We construct a minimalist model for our analysis. It has a simple
redistribution system and human capital accumulation, and production structure. There is
heterogeneity of the established and migrant population, and free migration.
The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II describes the model, and Section III
presents the policy setup. In Section IV we discuss the numerical simulations of the model. Section V
provides concluding remarks.
II.

The Model
We provide a stylized general equilibrium model with free migration, where policy is

determined by majority voting. 3

3

The model is based on Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2001a,b)

II.1 Human Capital Investment
There are just two types of workers: “skilled” (with a symbol 𝑆) and “unskilled” (with the

symbol 𝑈). The wage per unit of labor of a skilled worker is𝑤, whereas an unskilled worker earns a
wage of 𝜌𝑤 per unit of labor, where, 𝜌 < 1. All native-born (𝑁) are initially unskilled. But, a native-

born can acquire education at some cost (𝑐) and becomes skilled. Individuals differ from one another
through their cost of education: there is a continuum of native-born individuals, distinguished only by

their cost of education. For notational simplicity, we normalize the number of native-born individuals
to 1. An individual is identified by her cost of education, so that an individual with a cost of 𝑐 is

termed a c-individual. We assume for simplicity that the cost of education is uniformly distributed
over the interval [𝑜, 𝑐̅].

All native-born individuals are endowed with 𝐸 units of a composite good, the single good in

this economy. All individual inelastically

supply one unit of labor. If a c-individual acquires

education and becomes skilled, her income 4 is (denoted by 𝐼𝑆𝑁 )

𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐) = (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏 + (𝐸 − 𝑐)(1 + 𝑟)

.

, where 𝑡 is a flat wage tax rate 5; 𝑏 is a uniform (lump-sum) per capita social benefit; and 𝑟 is

the interest rate – the return to capital. If a c-individual decides not to acquire education and remain
unskilled, her income (denoted by 𝐼𝑈𝑁 ) is

𝐼𝑈𝑁 = (1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏 + 𝐸(1 + 𝑟)

(1).

(Note that 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐) depends on 𝑐, whereas 𝐼𝑈𝑁 does not)

Thus, there is a cutoff level of cost, 𝑐 ∗ , so that all c-individuals with 𝑐 ≤ 𝑐 ∗ will choose to

become skilled, and all the others (with 𝑐 ≥ 𝑐 ∗) will remain unskilled. This 𝑐 ∗ is defined by
(1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏 + (𝐸 − 𝑐 ∗ )(1 + 𝑟) = (1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏 + 𝐸(1 + 𝑟).

.

(1 − 𝑡)(1 − 𝜌)𝑤 = 𝑐 ∗ (1 + 𝑟).

.

Upon some re-arrangement, the cutoff level of the cost of education, 𝑐 ∗ , becomes:

4
5

Note that this specification assumes that capital does not depreciate at all.
In an unpublished version we extended the tax to apply to capital income as well.

6

That is, 𝑐 ∗ is solved from the equality between the return to education and its cost. A 𝑐 ∗ -

individual is just indifferent between acquiring education (and thereby becoming skilled) or staying
unskilled. Upon further re-arrangement, 𝑐 ∗ is defined by
(1 − 𝑡)(1 − 𝜌)𝑤
.
(1 + 𝑟)

𝑐∗ =

.

(2)

Note that 𝑐 ∗ may well exceed𝐸, which means that those c-individuals with 𝑐 below but close

to 𝑐 ∗ (which is endogenous) actually borrow in order to acquire education. Naturally, the payoff in
terms of the higher wage would more than offset the borrowing cost. For those individuals 𝐸 − 𝑐 is

negative.

Also, note that we are employing a static framework within which all economic and political
processes occur simultaneously with no time dimension. 6 For instance, we do not distinguish between
the time in which the education is acquired, and the time when the earnings occur. Similarly, capital
earns its return 𝑟 at the same time it is employed.

The number of c-individuals with 𝑐 ≤ 𝑐 ∗ is the number of native-born skilled individuals.

Denoting this number by 𝑛𝑆 , it follows that

𝑛𝑆 =

𝑐∗
.
𝑐̅

Then, the number of native-born unskilled individuals, 𝑛𝑈 , is thus given by
𝑛𝑈 = 1 − 𝑛𝑆 .

.

Therefore, the aggregate stock of physical capital, 𝐾, is equal to
𝐾 = 𝐸 − 𝐻.

6

.

(6)

Such a framework is akin to a steady state in a dynamic model with rational expectations.

7

There are also two types of migrants: the skilled who can earn a wage 𝑤 in the host country,

and the unskilled who earn a wage of 𝜌𝑤 in the host country. None of them has any initial

endowment. The migrants come to the host country after they have already made and implemented
the decision whether to acquire or not acquire education. Thus, it is exogenously given who is skilled
and who is unskilled. In other words, the economy benefits from the skilled migrants because it does
not have to pay for the cost of investment.
II.2 Income Groups
The income of skilled and unskilled migrants, respectively, is:

, and

𝐼𝑆𝑀 = (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏

𝐼𝑈𝑀 = (1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏.

.

(7)

.

(8)

The income of the native-born as a function of 𝑐 is depicted in Figure 2. Note that 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐)

declines in a straight line until it reaches 𝑐 ∗ , where

𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐 ∗ ) = (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏 + (𝐸 − 𝑐 ∗ )(1 + 𝑟) = (1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏 + 𝐸(1 + 𝑟) = 𝐼𝑈𝑁 .

The labor income of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the same,

but the total income of an unskilled migrant which is (1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏 is definitely below the income of

an unskilled native-born, the difference being the capital income enjoyed by the unskilled native-born,
namely 𝐸(1 + 𝑟). The total income of a skilled migrant is definitely higher than the total income of
the unskilled migrant, because of the higher wage earned by the skilled, whereas both have no other

income. The income of the skilled migrants exceeds the income of the skilled native-born with
𝑐 > 𝐸, but falls short of the income of the skilled native-born with 𝑐 < 𝐸.

𝑐

The income of a skilled migrant is 𝐼𝑆𝑀 = (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏, whereas the income of a skilled 𝑐-

individual is (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏 + (𝐸 − 𝑐)(1 + 𝑟). Therefore, as long as 𝐸 − 𝑐 is positive (i.e. the 𝑐-

individual does not borrow in order to invest in human capital), then 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐) > 𝐼𝑆𝑀 . But if 𝐸 − 𝑐 < 0
(i.e. the individual borrows in order to invest in human capital), then the income of the skilled migrant

(𝐼𝑆𝑀 ) is greater than the income of the skilled native-born (𝐼𝑆𝑁 ). In sum, we have the following ranking
of incomes:

𝐼𝑈𝑀 < 𝐼𝑈𝑁 = 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐 = 𝑐 ∗ ) < 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐 > 𝐸) < 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐 = 𝐸) = 𝐼𝑆𝑀 < 𝐼𝑆𝑁 (𝑐 < 𝐸).
II.3 Supply of Immigrants
Recall that the country employs an unrestricted migration policy. We envisage an economy
that allows any migrants to come. Thus, the decision whether to immigrate or no rests solely with the
migrant. Each potential migrant has some reservation income, so that she will migrate if and only if
she will be accorded a higher income in the destination country.
Due to various factors (such as skill, family ties, age, etc.) this reservation income is
not the same, but there is rather a continuum of such reservation incomes. Distinguishing between the
two skill groups, we then assume that there is an upward sloping supply function for each skill group,

9

depending on the income accorded to immigrants in the destination country. Denoting the number of
skilled migrants by 𝑚𝑆 , the supply function of skilled migrants is given by an iso-elastic function:
𝑚𝑆 = 𝐵𝑆 (𝐼𝑆𝑀 )𝜎𝑆

.

(9)

,where 𝐵𝑆 and 𝜎𝑆 are some positive parameters. Similarly, the supply function of unskilled

migrants is given by

𝑚𝑈 = 𝐵𝑈 (𝐼𝑈𝑀 )𝜎𝑈

.

(10)

, where 𝑚𝑈 is the number of unskilled migrants and 𝐵𝑈 and 𝜎𝑈 are some positive parameters.
II.4 Production and Factor Prices

We employ a Cobb-Douglas production function
𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾 𝛼 𝐿1−𝛼 ,

𝐴 > 0, 0 < 𝛼 < 1

.

(11)

, where 𝑌 is gross domestic product, 𝐴 is a total factor productivity (TFP) parameter, and 𝛼 is

the capital-share parameter (and (1 − 𝛼) is the labor-share parameter). Symbol 𝐿 indicates the total

labor supply in efficiency units and is given by

𝐿 = 𝑛𝑆 + 𝜌𝑛𝑈 + 𝑚𝑆 + 𝜌𝑚𝑈

.

(12)

The competitive wage per efficiency unit of labor (𝑤) and the competitive interest
rate (𝑟) are given by the marginal productivity conditions

, and

𝐾 𝛼
𝑤 = (1 − 𝛼)𝐴 � �
𝐿

𝐾 1−𝛼
𝑟 = 𝛼𝐴 � � ,
𝐿

.

(13)

.

(14)

, where we assume for simplicity that capital does not depreciate.

10

II.5 Income Redistribution System
We employ a very simple system of redistribution. Wages are taxed at a flat rate of 𝑡. The

revenues are distribution by a uniform per-capita transfer 𝑏.

We assume that the migrants qualify for all the benefits of the welfare state, and they are

naturally subject to the state taxes. Therefore, the government budget constraint is as follows:
𝑡𝑤𝐿 = 𝑏(1 + 𝑚𝑆 + 𝑚𝑈 )

.

(15)

, assuming that the government has no other revenue needs, except for redistribution. 7 Note
that it follows from equation (16) that 𝑡 and 𝑏 must be of the same sign. A positive wage tax (𝑡)

allows the government to accord a positive transfer (𝑏) to all. A subsidy to wages (namely, a
negative𝑡) requires the government to impose a lump-sum tax (negative- 𝑏) on all. When 𝑡 and 𝑏 are

positive, the tax-transfer system is progressive. When they are negative, the system is regressive.
III.

Policy Setup
With unrestricted migration the flows of migrants 𝑚𝑆 and 𝑚𝑈 are determined by the migrants

themselves according to their reservation incomes (embedded in the supply functions, (11) and (12)),
and the income accorded to them in the host country. There are therefore only two policy variables –
the tax rate 𝑡 , and the social benefit 𝑏. But as the government is constrained by a balanced budget

(condition (16)), it follows that there is essentially only one policy variables; once 𝑡 is chosen, all the
other economic variables are determined in equilibrium, including the tax revenue (𝑡𝑤𝐿), the number
of migrants (𝑚𝑆 , and 𝑚𝑈 ), and 𝑏. Or, alternatively, once 𝑏 is chosen, all the other economic
variables are determined in equilibrium.

Choosing 𝑡 as the single policy variable, we note that there remain 15 endogenous variables –
𝑤, 𝑏, 𝑟, 𝑐 ∗ , 𝐼𝑆𝑀 , 𝐼𝑈𝑀 , 𝑛𝑆 , 𝑛𝑈 , 𝐼𝑆𝑁 , 𝑚𝑆 , 𝑚𝑈 , 𝐻, 𝐾, 𝑌, 𝐿.

There are also 15 equations in the model – (2)-(9) and (10)-(16) from which the endogenous
variables get solved 8.

7

One may wonder why there is no tax on the initial endowment (𝐸). In a distortive. But in a dynamic setting
which we preferred to mimic in a static framework, 𝐸 represents accumulated savings, and taxing it will be
distortive. Furthermore, because all native-born possess the same initial endowment, taxing it in our static
model does not distribute income across native-born income groups; but taxing 𝐸 amounts to transferring
income from the native-born to the migrantsstatic model such a tax is not.
8
In addition, equation (1) defines 𝐼𝑆𝑁 as a function of 𝑐.

11

The policy variable is chosen by some natural and plausible version of a majority voting, as
described below.
Upon observation, we can see from equations (2) and (3) that the direct effect of the taxtransfer policy on the incomes of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the same, and
works through the net wage income (1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏. For the unskilled migrant this is the only effect of

the tax-transfer system. However, for unskilled native-born, there is also an indirect effect through
capital income 𝐼(1 + 𝑟) (note that 𝑟 depends on 𝑡); but this indirect effect is of a second-order
magnitude compared to the direct effect.

Similarly, the direct effect of the tax-transfer policy on the incomes of the skilled native-born
and the skilled migrants is the same and works through the net wage income (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏. Here

again, there is also and indirect effect on the income of the skilled native-born (but not on the income

of the skilled migrants) through the capital income (𝐸 − 𝑐)(1 + 𝑟). Here again the indirect effect is of

second-order magnitude.

Thus, all unskilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected by the tax-transfer policy
mainly through(1 − 𝑡)𝜌𝑤 + 𝑏, whereas all skilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected

mainly by (1 − 𝑡)𝑤 + 𝑏. It is therefore natural that all the unskilled whose wage is only 𝜌𝑤 would

rather prefer to tax wage income and take advantage of all the skilled whose wage is higher – 𝑤.

Thus, the most preferred policy of the unskilled entails a positive tax and a positive transfer.
Therefore, if the unskilled (both native-born and migrants) constitute a majority, then the political
economy equilibrium tax and transfer will be positive – a progressive tax-transfer system. However,

due to the indirect effect which applies only to the unskilled native born, the most-preferred tax and
transfer policy is not necessarily the same for the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants.
We then postulate that when the unskilled form a majority, then the tax-transfer policy chosen is the
most-preferred policy by the larger of the two sub-groups (the unskilled native-born or the unskilled
migrants).
Similarly, the skilled (both native-born and migrants whose wage is higher than the unskilled)
would opt to grant a subsidy to the wage, financed by a lump-sum tax. That is, they opt for negative 𝑡

and 𝑏 – a regressive tax-transfer policy. In this case too, there is also an indirect effect which applies

only the skilled native-born. Thus, the most-preferred tax-transfer policy is not the same for the two

sub-groups of skilled native-born and skilled migrants. In this case too we postulate that the politicaleconomy tax-transfer policy is the most-preferred policy of the larger sub-group.

12

Note that indirect effect of the tax-transfer policy which works through the capital income
(E − c)(1 + 𝑟) is not the same for all members of the skilled native-born sub-group (because it

depends on 𝑐). In this case we assume that the median voter within this group prevails.
IV.

Results

Our purpose, motivated by the Israeli experience with the wave of skilled migration from the
FSU, is to examine the effect of a supply shock of skilled migration on the political economy
equilibrium tax-transfer policy.
We start with parameter values that entail the unskilled (both native-born and migrants) as a
majority: 𝑥𝑈 + 𝑚𝑈 > 𝑥𝑆 + 𝑚𝑆 . This case is described in the first row in Table 2. As predicted, the
political-economy tax-transfer policy is progressive: 𝑡 and 𝑏 are positive. Also, the unskilled native-

born form a majority of the unskilled: 𝑥𝑈 > 𝑚𝑈 . The political-economy tax-transfer policy is the

most-preferred policy by the unskilled native-born.

Since the income of the native skilled population is not constant but a linear function of 𝑐, we report this group’s average income.
Notice that since the minimal income of a skilled native is equal to that of an unskilled native, we have that the income of the skilled
migrants lies in between them.

𝐴=1
14

We now keep all other parameter values constant and increase the parameter value of 𝐵𝑆 . That is, we

give a positive shock to the supply of skilled migrants. The results are shown in the second row of
Table 2. The number of skilled migrants (𝑚𝑆 ) rises sharply from 0.14 to 1.11. The skilled constitute

now the majority: 𝑥𝑆 + 𝑚𝑆 > 𝑥𝑈 + 𝑚𝑈 . As predicted, the political-economy tax-transfer policy
becomes now regressive: 𝑡 and 𝑏 are negative. That is, there is a wage subsidy financed by a lump

sum tax. Also, the skilled migrants form the larger of the two skilled sub-groups, (i.e. 𝑚𝑆 > 𝑥𝑆 ) and

their most-preferred tax-transfer policy becomes now the political-equilibrium tax-transfer policy.

Furthermore, as can be seen from the second row of Table 2, the politically dominant sub-group of
skilled migrants drives out all unskilled migrants (𝑚𝑈 = 0), by according them zero disposable
income (𝐼𝑈𝑀 = 0).

Noteworthy, the unskilled native-born were initially the politically dominant sub-group and dictated

their most-preferred progressive tax-transfer. Following the supply-side stock of skilled migration, the
unskilled native-born lose their dominance to the skilled migrants who are now dictating their mostpreferred regressive tax-transfer policy. Nevertheless, the unskilled native-born are better off, because
the return to their capital income (namely, 𝑟) rises sharply from 1.55 to 2.94 (in unit of the all-purpose

composite good). Even though the wage per efficiency unit falls (from 0.312 to 0.228), the sharp rise
in the rate of interest (from 1.55 to 2.94) more than compensates the native-born unskilled for the
wage decline. For the same reason, the skilled (native-born and migrants) are all better off. Thus,
except for the unskilled migrants, who are driven out, all other income groups gain from the skilledmigration supply shock.
Note that the influx of skilled labor raises overall productivity of the labor force; consequently, it does
also raise the tax revenue needed for shouldering the pre-existing redistribution policy. This force
works towards more generous redistribution, since it is fiscally less burdensome. Counteracting this

pro-distribution force, however, is the rebalancing of the political coalition triggered by the increased
share of higher-income skilled in the voting population. The result in Table 2 is that the emerging
decisive voter reverses the pre-existing redistribution regime.
It is worth explaining the model specific forces that totally drive out the unskilled migrants in the
wake of the skilled-migration supply shock. The model assumes perfect substitutability between
skilled and unskilled labor in production: each unit of time of an unskilled worker is equivalent to 𝜌

units of time of a skilled worker. Thus, unskilled migrants provide no productivity benefits to
the skilled. At the same time, they constitute a fiscal burden Therefore, the new skilleddominant coalition drive them out altogether by pushing their disposable income all the way
to zero. The assumed perfect substitutability in production does serve to highlight the antiunskilled-migration forces within the ruling skilled coalition.

Concluding Remarks

The motivation arose from the unique experience of Israel which within a short time period in the
early 1990s received scores of migrants from the Former Soviet Union. This sizeable migration
wave had an exceptionally large proportion of skilled migrants. Following this wave one could
detect a sharp new upward trend of disposable income inequality without a parallel change in
market income inequality.
This paper explores how migration can reshape immigration patterns that are jointly being
determined with the political balance of power. We distinguish between skilled and unskilled
immigrants, and between native-born and migrants. We explore the how jointly the redistributive
policies, skilled and unskilled immigration, and political coalitions, are all being jointly determined.
There are important political-economy insights

about the interaction between

free migration and

political rebalancing that our analysis brings out. The rise in the share of skilled in the labor force
diminishes the heavy weight of the redistribution-fiscal burden, from the viewpoint of the decisive
voter That is, the inflow of skilled labor raises the labor-force overall productivity, thereby raising the
tax revenue that is needed for shouldering the income-distribution regime. This pro-distribution force
is counteracted. The increased share of the skilled in the voting- population triggers political rebalancing. The emerging decisive voter reverses the pre-existing the redistribution regime,
notwithstanding the fall in the fiscal burden.
The influx of skill-immigrants also depresses the incentives for unskilled migrants to flow in, though
they are still free to do so. Notwithstanding the political rebalancing, the unskilled native-born may
well become better-off, even though they lose their political clout.
