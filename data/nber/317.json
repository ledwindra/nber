It reviews recent American debate over integration and dividend relief, the systems of dividend relief now being used in Europe, and commonly accepted standards for judging international tax policy. These standards are employed in the appraisal of existing arrangements in Europe, possible alternative systems for international taxation in a world of dividend relief, and, using the European-American situation as an example, relations between countries with dividend relief and those with classical systems.\n\n",
