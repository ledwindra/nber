Abstract

THE DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACT OF SOCIAL SECURITY

In the first part of the paper we report estimated transfers
in the Social Security system for the Retirement History Survey sample.
We define transfers to be the difference between the expected present

value of benefits less the present value of taxes paid in, where the
latter is adjusted for the probability of living to reach retirement age.
Unlike previous researchers we, therefore, account for the taxes paid by
people who died before retirement, and it turns Out this adjustment is

important for some groups. The Retirement History Survey cohort will
receive large transfers: roughly benefits will be about four times taxes,
and the real internal rate of return will be about eight percent. We study

how transfers vary by a comprehensive measure of wealth. People in the
highest wealth quartile have the largest absolute transfers, and their
internal rate of return is as high as that of any wealth quartile.
In the second part of the paper we study transfers for six synthetic

cohorts, the heads of which are age 65 in the ten—year intervals 1970

through

2020. Within each cohort 12 families are defined according to earnings levels.
We find that transfers are positive and large for the 1970 cohort, and that
they decline steadily until they are negative for most groups in the 2020

cohort. Although high earners initially have the largest transfers in the
1970 cohort, they have the largestnegative transfers in the 2020 cohort.

Introduction

Although Social Security retirement benefits are often thought of
as a repayment of past contributions, it is now becoming a matter of general

knowledge that the generation currently retired is receiving far more in

retirement annuities than It contributed in

taxes during their working lives

(see Boskin, et. al, 1983; Burkhauser and WarlIck, 1981; Leimer and Petri,

1981; Aaron, 1977). This is partly due to the state of the Social Security
system: The retired generation is still, receiving some of the windfall

start—up gains received by the elderly as such a system is begun or enlarged.
These gains will abate as the system matures and approaches a steady state.

The excess of benefits over taxes for the presently retired is also due to
the generosity of Congress in the early l970s: Between 1968 and 1974 benefits
were raised at a rate considerably higher than the

rate of inflation; therefore,

if the system had been actuarially fair in real terms prior to 1968, it
certainly would not have been after 1974.

A natural question is what is the magnitude of the gains or transfers
(i.e., benefits less contributions in expected present value terms) of the

elderly and how are they distributed? If the transfers are exceptionally
large or concentrated among the affluent, a reform of the Social Security
system might logically include the present retired generation giving up some

of their gains. It is likely that additional funds or payout reductions will
be required In the next ten years and that major adjustments are necessary to

operate the system over the next 75 years. The revenue sources or saving
could include an increase in payroll taxes for workers, an advancement of the

1

2

retirement age, or a decrease in the benefits of some of the currently

retired. These measures to ensure the financial solvency of Social Security
will have intergenerational impacts. Raising the taxes of workers or
increasing the retirement age will reduce the rate of return of the present
working generation; cutting benefits, perhaps by making them taxable, will

lower the gains of today's elderly. Because a substantial fraction of the
elderly are far from wealthy, an across the board reduction in benefits is

probably neither socially desirable nor politically feasible. However, the
wealthy retired could have their benefits reduced without causing undue

economic hardship. If they have received large windfall gains through the
Social Security system, fairness in restoring the financial soundness of
the program would dictate a reduction in their benefits.

In this paper we calculate the present value of lifetime contributions
to the Social Security system of a sample of the elderly, and the present

value of their expected benefits. The difference between the two we call
Social Security transfers. We also compute for each family in our sample
the internal rate of return to the retIrement program. That is, we
determine the discount rate which equates the present value of taxes to

the present value of benefits. Our data are the Social Security Administration's
Retirement History Survey. It originally interviewed slightly over 11,000
households in 1969. The head—of—household was between 58 and 64 years of age

in 1969. These households were reinterviewed every two years through 1979.
In this paper we calculate Social Security transfers and internal rates of
return for the sample in 1969, 1975, and 1979, but use the other interview
years to fill in missing values for our three years of primary interest.

3

Our primary results are that Social Security transfers and rates

of return were very high for this population in 1969 and remained high

throughout the decade. People in our sample could expect to receive three
to four times as much in benefits as they made in

contributions, even using

a three percent real rate of time discount and calculating death probabilities

using current life tables. Further, and more surprising, we find that the
wealthy received the largest transfers, and in many cases they even had the

highest rates of return. One must conclude that the Social

Security system

as now constituted has a substantial transfer element, and much of the
transfer is from average workers to the wealthy retired.

We have attempted to calculate how the rates of return and transfers
of the Social Security system will evolve as the system matures over the

next 40—50 years. We have done this by creating some synthetic work and
retirement histories for six different age cohorts and examining how the
Social Security program, as currently constituted, would treat them.

The households in this synthetic file are subject to the life hazards

gIven by the 1969 life tables. We do not project changes in life
expectancies which may occur. We find that the transfer components

monotonicaily decrease with each succeeding cohort (spaced in age by
ten years) and that the median two earner household of the cohort now aged

thirty—eight will receive negative transfers. This simply implies, of course,
that they experience an internal rate of return lower than the three percent
real rate we used in calculating transfers.

4

II. Methods and Data
The Retirement History Survey interview data has been merged with
the Social Security Administration's Earnings Record (through 1974). We
have extended the earnings history of each household by using the 1975,

1977, and 1979 interview responses. We then seek to calculate Social
Security transfers and internal rates of return for this cohort of households

as of 1969, 1975, and l979 However, we want to calculate the ex—ante rate
of return and transfers for the cohort with only the path of the Social
Security program taken as given. As far as we know, no one has pointed
out that calculations of transfers to the currently retired overstate transfers
to the cohorts of the retired, because the calculations do not take into
account taxes paid by members of the cohort who did not live to retirement

age. Thatis, the currently retired are the winners in the annuity gamble:
to study the intergenerational transfer component of Social Security, we need
to account for all the taxes and benefits of cohort members whether they are

alive or not at the time of the sample. As we shall see, for some groups
among the retired this is quite an important adjustment, substantially lowering

our estimates of their rate of return from Social Security. Our method of
accounting for taxes paid and benefits received by deceased members of the cohort is
described in some detail in the Appendix, but it may be briefly summarized
here.

From sex— and race—specific life tables and actual Social Security
contribution data of married survivors, we estimate taxes paid by deceased

married members of each cohort. Some of these taxes are allocated to widows
to reflect the taxes paid on behalf of the widows by their deceased husbands.

The remainder are allocated to the surviving couples. Each single person's

5

history is adjusted upward in a similar way to account for deceased

singles from the same cohort. Benefits received are treated in the same
manner. That is, benefits already received by deceased members of this
cohort are attributed to the survivors. In this way, we examine how an
entire cohort (in this case, alive in 1937 at the start—up of the system)

has fared with Social Security. These adjustments treat the future and
the past symetrically: future benefits are discounted, weighted by the
probabilities of living to collect the benefits, and then summed to get
the discounted expected discounted present value; past benefits are
multiplied by the appropriate interest rates and by a multiple reflecting

•cohort size at the time benefits were collected. In

1969, for example,

the taxes paid by the cohort and the benefits received and to be received
by the cohort are assigned to the surviving members of the cohort.

6

III. Results
The first of our results are shown in Tables 1—3, where we report
Social Security taxes paid and transfers received by race and marital

status for 1969, 1975, and 1979. The taxes are calculated according to
earnings records to the interview year, and the benefits under the assumption

that the person makes no more contributions to Social Security. Table 1
shows that the life table adjustment makes little difference for couples

in the sample. This Is because extra taxes are attributed to interviewed
couples according to the probability that both partners of an original couple

died before 1969, and this event has low probability. However, the taxes of
widows and widowers (referred to in this paper as widows only because they

predominate) are more than doubled. This occurs because the Social Security
Earnings History only records the widows' own earnings record and contribution

profile. When we attribute to widows the contributions made by their deceased
spouses, it naturallyraises substantially the total taxes assigned to widows.
Even so, all groups, including widows, have substantial transfers both in

absolute value and in the returnratIo, the ratio of the present value of
benefits to the present value of taxes. It is the case, however, that widows
have smaller transfers and lower return ratios than other groups: they only
receive the husband's benefit rather than the husband's and wife's benefit;

in most cases the taxes paid by the widow herself do not contribute to her
benefit because the husband's benefit is larger. It should be noted
that if account is not made of taxes paid by deceased husbands, one gets a

completely different impression of the return ratio of widows. For example,

7

if average actual taxes and average benefits are used, the return ratio
is 4.9, higher than that of

couples. If average adjusted taxes are used,

the return ratio is 2.03.

The internal rate of return is that interest rate, that will equate
the real life—table—weighted stream of taxes to the real life table—weighted
stream of benefits, assuming future benefits will be paid according to the
law in effect.. The median rate of
is a real rate of return, and is

return of couples in 1969 was 8.39. This

very much greater than what is generally assumed

to be offered by other investments. For example, In our present value
calculations for the first three columns of

these tables, we have used a

three percent real rate; the Social Security actuaries often use a 2.5 percent

real rate. Over a number of years the difference between such rates and our
calculated internal rate of return is enormous. For example, a 60 year—old
in 1969 would have been 28 in 1937, the year in which Social Security taxes

were first paid. At a real rate of 2.5 percent, a dollar contributed in
1937 would have grown to $2.20 in real terms by 1969; at a real rate of 8.39
percent, a dollar contributed in 1937 would have grown to $13.17 in real terms

by 1969. At 6.01 percent, the widow's rate of return, it would have grown to
$6.47. Over the 70 years that some people will be paying to or receiving from
the Social Security system, even small differences in the rates of return will
produce large differences in the present values.

In interpreting the very high

internal rates we calculate, one should also note that Social Security contributions and benefits are very heavily sheltered

from the personal income tax. The

benefits are completely tax free, the "compounding" is done on a tax free basis,
and only half the contributions (the employee's share) are subject to Dersonal
income tax.

In 1969 the rate of return of couples was the highest of the

marital groups. Many researchers have stressed how the system discriminates
against two earner couples in the sense that the contributions of the wife
are wasted in that they do not increase the benefits of the family.

Certainly this is true relative to one earner couples. However, married
couples as a group obviously do at least as well as singles since they are
offered their choice at time of retirement between being treated as two

singles or calculating their benefits as a married couple. As a group, the
married couples receive the highest rates of return from Social Security.
Nonwhites have slightly lower rates of return than whites, and

significantly lower absolute transfers. These outcomes are determined by
the higher mortality rates of nonwhites, meaning that fewer live to collect

benefits. Our "fallen comrade" calculation of attributing taxes of deceased
cohort members Is more important for nonwhites. Nonwhites also have lower
earnings records on average (reducing the size of the absolute transfer) and
a larger fraction of nonwhite couples have two earners which tends to reduce
the rates of return.

Tables 2 and 3 show Social Security taxes, transfers, and rates of

return for 1975 and 1979 by race and marital status. By 1975, taxes and
transfers of all groups had risen. The rate of return of whites had increased
even further, yet the rate of return of blacks had fallen slightly. The
difference is undoubtedly due to the difference in mortality:

a higher fraction

of nonwhites than whites in our sample died before reaching retirement age

between 1969 and 1975. The difference between life table—adjusted taxes and
actual taxes of widows continues to be large, and it begins to widen for other

categories. By 1979, the rates of return had begun to fall for reasons to be

discussed later. It was still the case that couples had higher rates than
the other marital groups, and that whites had higher rates than nonwhites.

The life table adjustment has become important for all groups. The 1979
samples are those aged 68—74 years and these are certainly a sample of

winners in the annuity game.
Tables 4—6 present results on taxes and transfers by age in 1969,

1975, and 1979. In general, the internal rates of return and the absolute
transfers are higher for the older households in the sample in all three

interview years. This is presumably due to the maturing of the Social Security
system. The older members of this population enjoyed more of the start—up
gains of a pay—as—you—go retirement plan. The difference is most striking
in 1969. Recall our assumption that no future contributions are made to the
system. In 1969, the youngest cohort must wait four years to retire, so
discounting has a substantial effect.
Table 7 collects some of the rate of return-results from Tables 4—6.

It shows that the real internal rate of return to Social Security increased
from 1969 to 1975 for the younger cohorts In our sample, even when both taxes

and benefits are life table adjusted. The real return decreased for the oldest
two cohorts between 1969 and 1975 and also decreased for households of all

ages between 1975 and 1979. The net change was an increase in the rate of
return between 1969 and 1979 for the youngest two cohorts and a fairly sharp

decline for the oldest three. These differences are probably the result of
two factors: first, the law changes between 1969 and 1975 increased the
rates of return, but after 1975 the law changes only increased the future

real payments of workers through double indexing. This, however, had no

effect on the real payments of retired people. Second, because delayed
retirement between ages 62 and 65 is roughly actuarially fair at a three
percent real interest rate, a delay in retirement will decrease the internal

rate from the high values shown here. Of course, the internal rate will
decrease even faster when someone works after the age of 65.

Tables 8-l0 show Social Security transfers, return ratios and
internal rates of return by wealth quartile and by age in 1969, 1975, and

1979. The wealth variable is quite comprehensive in that it includes the
value of home, business, and farm equity, other real property, stocks, bonds,
bank accounts, pensions, the capitalized value of welfare payments, and the

capitalized insurance value of Nedicare. It excludes Social Security wealth and
human capital. Table 8 indicates that Social Security transfers increase sharply

by wealth quartile, especially if taxes are adjusted by the life tables. We
feel such an adjustment is necessary to get a true picture of the way a cohort

has fared with Social Security. The median life table adjusted transfer to
those in the top wealth quartile is more than $6,000 higher than that to

those in the lowest wealth quartile, a 69 percent difference. The reason
that the increase with wealth is greater for the life table adjusted numbers
is that widows are heavily represented in the lower part of the wealth distri—
tion, and the fallen comrade tax adjustment is much greater for them than for

other groups. The increasing transfers with wealth are also due to the greater
contributions of the wealthy to Social Security, a system which offered this
generation a rate of return far greater than our three percent discount rate.
The importance of using life—adjusted taxes is also shown in the return ratios:
with unadjusted taxes, it appears that the lowest wealth quartile has a somewhat
higher ratio of benefits to taxes than the other quartiles, yet when account is
made of taxes paid by the deceased, the return ratio is almost flat across the
quartiles.

Finally, the rates of return shown in Table 8 are almost the same
for the wealth

groups. Most researchers would find this result surprising

because the Social Security benef-it schedule has considerable progressivity.

Apparently, that is neutralized by the taxes paid by the deceased and, possibly,

by a different time pattern of contributions. For example, holding constant
total undiscounted nominal contributions, the rate of return will increase if
the contributions are made late in life rather than early.

Table 8 also shows how the transfers, return ratios, and rates of

return vary by age within quartiles. It is important to disaggregate by
age because both wealth arid the rate of return vary positively by age.

Table 8 shows that at each age the transfers to those in the wealthiest
quartile are much greater than the transfers to those in the lowest wealth

quartile. In fact, for a couple of age groups the transfers are almost
twice as great to the wealthy as to the poor. Table 8 shows that the
internal rates of return are fairly flat across wealth quartiles; the
highest rate of return recorded is for the upper wealth quartile among our
eldest cohort, the 64 year—olds.

Table 9 contains similar results for 1975. The wealth and transfer
figures are in 1974 dollars. The difference between adjusted and unadjusted
taxes has become more important as reflected in the difference between the

two transfer measures. Even more than in 1969, the unadjusted median return
ratio gives a substantially different impression than the adjusted median

return ratio: the one indicates that in percentage terms the poorer elderly
gained more than the wealthy elderly, whereas the second indicates they

did worse. The life table adjusted transfers to the wealthiest quartile
are roughly double the transfers to the poorest quartile at every age

except 70. Even their rates of return are higher at every age.

25

The results for 1979 as shown in Table 10 are similar to the 1975

results: the adjustment for taxes according to the life table is important,
and, in fact, removes the negative correlation of the median return ratio

with wealth quartile. The internal rates of return ar down somewhat from
1975, most particularly for those in the wealthiest quartile. The apparent
explanation is that those who worked past age 65 lowered their rates of return,
and that more of the relatively wealthy did that than those in the lower

wealth quartiles. The overall result of Tables 8—10, however, still remains
that among the current elderly the wealthy have enjoyed the same high rate of
return from Social Security as the poorer members of their age cohort.

26

IV.

Simulations
In this section we calculate the projected transfers and rates of

return for six age cohorts, four household types, and three levels of earnings

histories. This gives us some information about the intergenerational transfers
implied by the Social Security system and predicts how the intrageneratlonal

transfers will change for later cohorts. It also shows the effects of the
maturing of the system on the rate of return it offers.
The household types examined are single males, single females, and one

and two earner married couples. We have collected data on median annual
earnings for men and women by age from 1937 to 1977. These data were extended
through the year 2020 with the assumption that median earnings grow at ten

percent from 1977 to 1982 and six percent thereafter. The accuracy of this
assumption is not critical to our analysis because we use it only to generate
the nominal earnings histories of our simulated households; that our profiles

exactly match median values is relativelr unimportant. We project two percent
productivity growth, and therefore four percent CPI inflation beyond 1982.
For the simulated single men and women, we create three earnings prof lies from

age 20 to 65, or, for the older cohorts, from 1937 until retirement at age 65.
The low earnings profile is set at one—half the median earnings pattern, while
the high earnings profile is set at the maximum earnings level subject to
Social Security payroll taxes or five times the median, which ever is less.

The one earner married couples are assigned earnings histories equivalent
to the single males, while the taxes of the two earner married couples are the sum
of those of a low earning single male and female, a median earning

male and a

low earning woman and, finally, a high earning male and a median earning

woman. All told, there are 12 simulated households in each age cohort; three

27

earnings profiles for each of four household types. The age cohorts are
people who reach age 65 in 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020.

Husbands and wives are assumed to be the same age.
Unlike in the previous section, our simulations do not include widows.
The single households have been life—long singles and their taxes reflect
their own contributions plus the contributions of singles who, according

to the life tables, die before age 65. The taxes of marrieds are also life
table adjusted, but only for married couples where both spouses fail to reach

age 65. After retirement, assumed to take place at age 65, we keep track
of the joint survival probabilities of married couples and credit the benefits
received during the resulting widowhood after the death of the first spouse.
Table 11 shows the internal rates of return for the 12 simulated

households in six age cohorts. Several clarifications are necessary before
these can be properly interpreted. First, these rates of return are done in
an "ex ante" sense from age 65. By that, we mean that individuals assume
that the annuities they receive will remain constant in real terms (except
for reduced survivor benefits) and they do not take into account changes

which may take effect ex post. Second, and similarly, the benefits and taxes
paid out and collected after 1983 in our calculations are those projected in
the Annual Statistical Supplement of the Social Security Bulletin (1980).
Thus, these are not adjusted for changes which appear to be necessary to
balance aggregate Social Security retirement benefits and taxes.
The effect of the proposed changes will be to drive down the real rates of
return for the younger cohorts, almost certainly making them negative for

high earning single males and some two earner couples. The rates of return

reported in Table 11, then, should be taken as absolute upper bounds for
these households and age cohorts since all signs indicate that they will
pay more taxes and receive lower benefits than those officially projected
in the Social Security Bulletin and used in these calculations.

The internal rates of return calculated for the 1970 cohort are
consistent with our earlIer examination of the Retirement History Survey

population. Again, it should be emphasized that our simulated singles

do not include widows. Within each household type the high earnings household
has a lower rate of return. However, our earlier results indicated that this
did not imply that wealthier retired households had lower rates of return on

Social Security. The projected decline with cohort age in real internal
rates of return is monotonic and substantial. For example, the median single
female retiring in 1970 has an expected real rate of return of 9.1 percent.
If she reached age 65 in 2000, however, she would only enjoy an expected 3.8

percent return. Single women earn higher rates than single men, not only
due to their longer life expectancy but also due to their lower earnings profiles.
The results of Table 11 indicate that those reaching age 65 in 1970
and 1980 were among those receiving windfall gains from the start—up and

expansion of a pay—as—you—go Social Security scheme. The 1970 cohort enjoyed
higher rates partly because it had a shorter history of tax payments (this

generation was age 32 in 1937). The 1980 cohort and to a lesser extent the
1990 cohort did well because Social Security tax rates were low during a

substantial fraction of their work lives. Consistent with the results of the
previous section, we find that the start—up and expansion gains are diminishing,

but that they extend over a longer period than is commonly realized. Those
who retired on Social Security from 1940 to 1990 will enjoy some of these

at time of retirement except in 1970 where Inflation
aBenefits and taxes were projected according to the law
indexation was assumed.

gains, and a noticeable fraction of the

elderly population will be in

this category until the year 2010.
The life table adjusted expected Social

Security transfers in 1980

dollars are shown in Table 12 for our simulated households. Again, the
results are roughly in accord with our examination of the Retirement History

Survey population. As in the previous section, the real discount rate used
in the transfer calculations

was three percent. For the households retiring
in 1970, Social Security was "a good deal" and in most cases the higher
earnings
households received larger transfers because they were allowed to participate
in this good deal to a larger extent.

This effect offset the somewhat lower

internal rate earned by households with

higher earnings profiles as shown in

the previous table. For the younger cohorts, the level of transfers is much
lower (and in some cases, negative)

is very different. Consider the

and their pattern across earnings profiles

higher earnings households retiring in the

year 2010 or later; rather than being allowed to participate in
a larger extent

in a good deal (which was the case for the high earners earlier), those with
high earnings in the later cohorts are forced to participate to a larger extent
in a program which offers tham a poor return. Each of our high earnings
household types retiring in the year 2010 has negative transfers. The
progressive nature of the program, which has had essentially no impact on those

who have retired to date, is

strongly evident by the year 2010. The reforms

currently being discussed will not only further lower the transfer numbers

of the young cohorts, but may add to the strong progressive pattern
of the transfer figures already projected for them under current law.

32

V. Conclusion
We have examined the real rates of return and the transfers in

the retirement (OASI) component of Social Security. Most of our analysis
uses the Retirement History Survey population which ranged in age from
58 to 64 in 1969 and which was interviewed six times from 1969 to 1979.

Our primary result is that this generation did extremely well on Social

Security, earning a real rate of return of roughly eight percent. We
calculated this number taking into account the taxes paid by the unfortunate
cohort members who did not live to retirement age, and found this to be an

important correction. Without it, we would get even higher rates of return
for the RHS household population.

We examined the rates of return and transfers by marital status, race

and age. The results were that the married couples had higher rates of
return than singles in the RHS population, and that non—whites did less well

than whites. The lowest rates of return were for widows when account is
taken of the taxes paid by the deceased spouses.

Perhaps our most interesting result, other than the high rate of
return itself, is that the rate of return does not decline with wealth for

this population sample. In fact, the wealthy in the RHS population have
earned roughly the same high rate of return as their poorer cohort members
and have enjoyed far higher absolute transfers.

In the final section of the paper we simulated the evolution of the

impact of the Social Security system on 12 household types. We project that
the high rates of return would have declined monotonically and significantly

even before the Social Security changes now contemplated. The transfer
components become negative for some households; for example, the negative

transfer is projected at $180,000 (1980 $)

for

high income single males

currently age 27. The intergenerational transfers are extremely large
and the intragenerational distribution of transfers is quite different
(more progressive) for the currently young than it is for the presently
elderly.

The results of this paper should be useful in assessing how the

Social Security system could be revised. It indicates that the idea that
all current retirees should be protected from cuts and only those who will
retire in 20 or more years should be asked to rescue the system would lead
to a policy of protecting those who have done well at the expense of those

who are already projected to do poorly. Of course, this consideration must
be weighed against the financial flexibility of the young relative to the
currevtly elderly.

APPENDIX

CALCULATION OF PRESENT VALUE OF TAXES AND
BENEFITS,
AND RATE OF RETURN

The basic principle is that all taxes paid and
benefits received
by a cohort will be allocated to surviving members of the cohort. Unless
this is done the survivors will appear to have received above average rates
of return even under an

actuarially fair annuity system. We distinguish

groups according to marital status (married, single or widowed), sex and
race.

Consider first a single person of age A with a stream of past taxes,
t., and of past benefits, b.,. Let P. be the probability that a person will
live to age A given that he has reached age i. Thus, for each person of

age A there were l/P persons living at age i. There were on average

t1(l/P — 1) taxes paid at age I by people who died before
reaching age A
and who had similar tax histories to the surviving person in the sample.

The present value of these taxes over all ages less than A is

A
ti(l/Pj —
i=l

where

. is

1)(1 + r.)1

the price level adjustment.

A-i

r1 was taken to be a Constant three

percent. This number was added to the present value of

taxes actually paid

to get the total of taxes paid by the person in the sample and by similar

people who did not survive until age A. Because the sample is self—weighting,
aggregating over all singles will give a good estimate of total taxes paid
by the cohort, provided mortality rates are independent of tax contributions.

A- 2

The mortality probabilities are race and sex specific; they are calculated
from the 1969 life tables.

The present value of past benefits received by the cohort is
calculated in a way symmetric to the calculation of taxes.

Now consider a widow in the 1969 sample. The data only include her
tax contributions, which will be treated in the same way as the taxes of

a single person. However, in almost all cases her benefits are based on
the taxes of her deceased husband, and a rate of return calculation should

take those into account. This is done by allocating part of the taxes paid

by deceased husbands to the widows. The general reasoning is that for each
surviving couple, there were additional couples who paid taxes but did not

survive as couples. Some survived as widows, some as widowers, and some had
no survivors. From the life tables and our data on the tax histories of
husbands, we can calculate taxes paid by deceased husbands in the same way

as was done for singles. That amount multiplied by the probability that
the wife lived is allocated to widows; the remainder is allocated to surviving

couples. More specifically, if t. is the tax stream of a husband in the
1

A

sample, ET =
i=1

t1(l/P.

—

1).(1

+ rj)A1 is the present value of taxes

paid by deceased husbands who were similar to the surviving husband. ET
multiplied by the probability the wife survives until the survey year is
allocated to widows and the remainder is allocated to married couples in

the sample. The allocation for widows is summed over all couples. That
amount divided by the number of widows is added to the life table—adjusted
taxes actually paid by each widow on her own

earnings

record. In principle,

the taxes paid by deceased wives should be similarly allocated between the

A- 3

couple and widowers, but for simplicity we allocated all of them to the

couples: wives have small tax contribution histories and the probability
that the husband outlives the wife is small. Again, it is assumed that
the mortality rates are independent of taxes. In addition, we assume
independence between mortality rates of husbands and wives. Past benefits
are treated symmetrically to taxes.

The present value of future benefits uses the 1969 life tables.

Mortality probabilities of husbands and wives are assumed to be independent.
The following provisions of the law were taken into consideration:

actuarial

reduction for early retirement; one percent benefit increase for work past
age 65; a wife may draw on her own record or her husband's record; a widow
may draw at age 60 at a reduced fraction of her husband's PIA, but at age
62 she can switch to her own record if it yields a higher benefit; the PIA
calculation is based on the law in effect in the year of the calculation;

a widow's benefit is reduced if her former husband drew benefits before he
was 65 or if she draws benefits before she is 65.

The rate of return in year T is calculated in the following way.
Let t.
1 and b.
1 be the life table—adjusted real stream of taxes and benefits

of an individual. The t. will be zero prior to year of employment and

after retirement. The b. will be zero before retirement; after T, they
will be calculated according to the Social Security law in effect in year I.
N
T
The rate of return in year T solves the equation
b.(1 + r)T_i =
tjl + r)T1,
i=O 1
i=O
where N is the maximum age and 0 < T < N.
