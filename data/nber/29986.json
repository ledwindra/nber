    "abstract": "\n\nUsing responses obtained through the Nielsen Homescan panel survey, we explore the differences between managers\u2019 and non-managers\u2019 expectations and perceptions of inflation and unemployment. By and large, managers and non-managers exhibit similar average inflation and unemployment expectations as well as similar levels of disagreement and sensitivity to information provided in a randomized control trial. Finally, the inflation expectations of managers deviate systematically from the predictions of \u201canchored\u201d expectations.\n\n",
