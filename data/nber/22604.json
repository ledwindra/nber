    "abstract": "\n\nStudents receiving financial aid pay different amounts for equivalent education and do so in different ways:  Grants, which do not have to be repaid, loans, which are paid back in the future, and work-study, pay-as-you-go. We examine the effects of need-based aid independent of study ability on student outcomes \u2013 grade point average in particular - controlling for student background and attributes they had prior to college.  We also analyze grades within colleges.  The results suggest that students receiving need-based grants do significantly better in college than those not receiving financial aid while those paying for college with loans perform significantly worse than students receiving other forms of aid.\n\n",
