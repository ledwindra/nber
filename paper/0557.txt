Capital MohiUty- and, Devaluation in an
Optimizing Model with Rational Expectations

Abstract

This paper examines the effects- of exchange-rate policies when individuals maximize lifetime utility on the basis of rational expectations
about the future.

The institutional framework is a small economy in which

the central bank holds the exchange rate fixed at each moment in time, but
- allows it to depreciate over time according to a pre-announced schedule.
In this setting, an unanticipated, discrete devaluation of the currencyhas no real effects.

It occasions only a tranfer of interest-bearing

foreign assets from the public to the central hank.

An unanticipated,

permanent increase in the rate of devaluation, in contrast, causes a
sharp fall in consumption, a current-account surplus, and a long-run decline in the reserves of the central bank.

This paper examines the effects of exchange-rate policies when individuals maximize lifetime utility on the basis of rational expectations about
the future.

The economy studied is one in which the authorities allow free

mobility of capital under a crawling-peg exchange-rate regime.

Many indus-

trializing economies have adopted a crawling peg as a means of reconciling
disparate inflation rates at home and abroad, and some recent efforts to use
the rate of crawl as an instrument of anti-inflation policy have attracted
considerable interest (see Carlos D1az Alejandro).

Tools similar to those em-

ployed here have been applied by Guillermo Calvo (1979a) to study this type of
exchange-rate management under conditions of capital immobility.
An

advantage of the explicit optimization framework is the light it throws

on the interaction between private economic decisions and the balance sheets of
the government and, particularly, the central bank.

Although the literature on

open-economy financial policy has largely ignored such considerations--the exceptions include papers by Alan Stockman and myself (1979, 1980a)--the extent
to which the public internalizes official asset holdings has obvious consequences for the efficacy of official intervention in asset markets.

An impli-

cation of the model explored below is that the stock of central-bank reserves,
when allowed to earn interest, will be perceived by the public as part of its
own wealth.

In this setting, devaluation loses its real effects, for a dis-

crete rise in the price of foreign exchange occasions a proportional issue of
central-bank money, a transfer of interest-bearing foreign bonds from the public
to the bank, and nothing more.
The optimization hypothesis, as applied here, eliminates the indeterminacy typically associated with models assuming rational expectations or
perfect foresight.

This is an additional advantage, as it provides a firm

ground for convergence assumptions that must usually go unjustified. The explicit
specification of agents' objective functions leads also to a natural welfare
analysis of alternative policies.

I.

The Model
The economy I consider is inhqbited by a representative household, which

derives utility from consuming a single composite commodity and holding real
money balances.

Household wealth is divided between high-powered money hold-

ings (there is no banking system) and holdings of an internationally-traded
bond having a fixed foreign-currency face value.

The economy is small, and

therefore can influence neither the (positive) world bond rate, P, nor the
foreign-currency price of the consumption good, P*, both of which are taken
to be fixed. l

The domestic-currency price of consumption, P, is linked to

the world price by the relationship P

=

EP*, where E, the exchange rate, is

the price of foreign money in terms of domestic money.
The central bank causes the exchange rate to depreciate according to a preannounced schedule by standing ready at each instant to trade home currency for
foreign exchange on the pre-announced terms.

This type of exchange-rate regime

has been studied, in somewhat different contexts, by Calvo (1979a, 1979b), Paul
Krugman, Jorge de Macedo, Carlos Rodriguez, Sweder van Wijnbergen, and others.
It is assumed that the official schedule calls for a constant, non-negative rate

of devaluation,E, which must equal the domestic inflation rate, Pip, at all times.
The representative household's instantaneous utility function is written
as Ut

= u(ct,mt ),

where c t is the family's consumption rate and mt represents

its nominal money holdings, Mt , deflated by Pt.

The function u(·,·) is posi-

tive, twice continuously differentiable, increasing in both its arguments, and
strictly concave.

The consolidated budget constraint of the government and central

It embodies the very

In the absence of interest-bearing government

of transfer payments over central-bank foreign interest earn-

ings must be financed by domestic credit creation.

The latter will in general

be accompanied by changes in the foreign source component of the money supply,
and sO,cannot be identified with monetary growth.

I assume that the level

of government transfers is continuously varied in such a way that the rate of
real domestic credit expansion equals lODe per cent of the stock of real balances at each moment.

This implies a public-sector budget constraint of the form

Exchange-Rate Policies
To illustrate the workings of the model, I consider in this section

two types of exchange-rate policy, a one-time, unanticipated devaluation of
the currency

(a discrete increase in E) and a permanent, unanticipated

increase in the rate of devaluation, E.

These are the two policies compared

by Calvo (1979a) for a utility-maximizing economy in which domestic money
is the only privately-owned asset.
An unanticipated devaluation leaves the two schedules in figure I
unchanged, and has no effect on the national

The devaluation thus leaves the economy at its

long-run equilibrium position:

it has no real consequences.

Just as in

the traditional one-asset framework (see Rudiger Dornbusch and Calvo (1979a»,
the devaluation brings about a sharp rise in the price level and fall in
real balances.

But in a setting of capital mobility,

the

fall in real

An incipient excess demand for money exerts

downward pressure on the exchange rate, and this forces the central bank to
intervene in the asset market, purchasing foreign bonds and issuing money
until the public's real balances have been restored to their initial level.
It is important to realize why this tranfer of bonds from the public
to the central bank reverses the wealth effect on consumption typically associated with the fall in the real value of privately-held, marketable assets
(see, e.g., Jacob Frenkel and Rodriguez).

Reserves acquired by the bank

of higher transfer payments.

The public, in turn, anticipates and capital-

izes this income stream, and so, perceives no change in its overall wealth when

The central bank accommodates this growing demand for money by continu-

ous intervention in the foreign exchange market, thereby preventing any deviation of the exchange rate from its announced path and also inducing a rising
path of official.reserves.

Ultimately, however, the reserves gained during

the transition do not make up for those lost during the initial portfolio
adjustment in reaction to the change in E.

A higher asymptotic level of re-

serves would be inconsistent with the requirement that real balances be lower
in the new stationary state than in the original one.
This time path of reserves and consumption stands in interesting contrast to the one found by Calvo (1979a) in a context of capital immobility.
When there is only one asset, there can be no portfolio shift in response to
an increase in the rate of depreciation, and so a discrete fall in real balances is precluded.

Rather than overshooting their eventual, lower levels,

real money and reserves decline monotonically over time.

From an initial

position of long-run equilibrium, consumption must rise on impact to induce
the implied current-account deficit.
In the present setting of capital mobility, the integral of discounted
utilities, (1), is lower along the transition path following a rise in
than it would have been along the original stationary-state path.

E

This fol-

lows from the observation that the household's instantaneous utility falls
when E is raised,

returning to its initial level only in the long run.

Thus, an increase in the rate of devaluation has a negative effect on the
welfare of economic agents.

These conclusions naturally require modification when reserves bear no

Stanley Fischer inaggregative, closed-economy, rational-expectations models.
Portfolio substitution from money to capital provides the mechanism through
which anticipated monetary growth affects real variables.
