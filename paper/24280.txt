Inequality and Aggregate Demand

NBER Working Paper No. 24280
February 2018
JEL No. D31,D52,E21,E63
ABSTRACT
We explore the transmission mechanism of income inequality to output. In the short run, higher
inequality reduces output because marginal propensities to consume are negatively correlated
with incomes, but this effect is quantitatively small in the data and in our model. In the long run,
the output effects of income inequality are small if inequality is caused by rising dispersion in
individual fixed effects, but can be large if it is the manifestation of higher individual income
risk. We formalize the connection between partial and general equilibrium effects, and show that
the two are closely related under standard assumptions about the behavior of monetary policy.
Our economy features a depressed long-run real interest rate, allowing us to quantify the potential
contribution of income inequality to secular stagnation.

Introduction

There is an old idea1 that the distribution of income is an important determinant of aggregate
economic activity, with higher income inequality reducing aggregate demand and employment. These concerns resurfaced during the Great Recession, at a time where most central
banks around the world hit the zero lower bound. For example, the 2012 Economic Report of
the President (Council Of Economic Advisers 2012) argued that
some of the recent patterns in aggregate spending and saving behavior—including
the sluggish growth in consumer spending—may reflect the sharp rise over the
past 30 years in the inequality in the income distribution in the United States. [...]
The rise in income inequality may have reduced aggregate demand, because the
highest income earners typically spend a lower share of their income—at least over
intermediate horizons—than do other income groups.
In this paper, we formally investigate the link between income inequality and output. We
use a canonical Bewley (1977) model that provides a good fit to the U.S. income and wealth
distributions. The heterogeneity in marginal propensities to consume out of one-time income
(MPCs) generated by the model plays a central role in our analysis. To study the connection
with monetary policy, we also introduce downward nominal wage rigidities, as in SchmittGrohé and Uribe (2016) and Eggertsson, Mehrotra and Robbins (2017). Examining a range
of plausible scenarios under which inequality can rise, we generally find output effects that
are negative but small, with one notable exception: if inequality is caused by an increase in
individual income risk, and monetary policy does not or cannot lower interest rates enough to
offset it, then a large, long-lasting slump can ensue.
For temporary increases in inequality, in line with common intuition, we find that the key is
the relationship between MPCs and income. But although the rich have lower MPCs than the
poor, the gap is not large enough for realistic changes in the income distribution to have much
effect on aggregate consumption. For instance, in our calibrated model, the average MPC of the
top 10% of income earners is about 0.10 less than the average MPC of the bottom 90% of earners.
In household-level data, the average MPCs for these two groups are even closer. Hence, every
additional 1% of overall income shifting from the bottom 90% to the top 10% (a larger-thanusual year on year change; see Piketty and Saez 2003) lowers aggregate consumption by no
more than 0.1% of total income.
Such calculations, however, are only directly informative about a partial equilibrium (PE)
effect: the impact of inequality on consumption demand, shutting off endogenous responses
from interest rates and incomes. In principle, these endogenous responses could move the
general equilibrium (GE) output effect in either direction. On the one hand, feedback between

aggregate consumption and incomes could aggravate the output decline; on the other, an equilibriating fall in real interest rates could offset or even overturn the negative output effect.
To sort through these forces, we develop a novel methodology that connects the GE outdY

come to its PE underpinnings. We show that, to first order, the percentage change

level of output resulting on impact from an inequality shock can always be expressed as

Here, both the multiplier and the sufficient statistic are vectors, and the outcome is their dot
product. The sufficient statistic measures the partial equilibrium consumption effect of the
shock, and can be written explicitly as the sequence of cross sectional covariances Cov( MPCit , dyi0 )
between households’ income shocks dyi0 and their marginal propensities to consume MPCit at
each horizon t following a shock.2 This formalizes the role of MPCs in the response to an inequality shock, clarifying exactly what moments matter for aggregate outcomes. The general
equilibrium multiplier, by contrast, reflects a variety of forces in the model, especially the monetary and fiscal policy rules in place. Crucially, however, it does not depend on the particular
shock being considered: the same multiplier applies for any shock to income distribution. This
allows us to cleanly isolate and test the role of general equilibrium forces.
In our model, if monetary policy allows the real interest rate to adjust to maintain full employment, we find that the multiplier is identically 0: regardless of the inequality shock, output
is unchanged on impact. This “neoclassical” policy, however, requires that monetary policy
respond to inequality in an aggressive and immediate way, which may not be likely or even
feasible in practice. As an alternative, we consider a benchmark scenario where monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound (ZLB)—as it was in the U.S. until recently, and
continues to be in many other developed economies. Here, we find that the multiplier takes
a simple form: its first entry is approximately 1, and its other entries approximately 0. In
other words, the GE and PE effects of an inequality shock on output approximately coincide.
Since the PE effect on impact is measurable, this allows us to directly verify our results using
household-level data.
As our main quantitative experiment, we consider a temporary increase of 0.04 in the standard deviation of log earnings, roughly the increase in the U.S. since 2000. In the benchmark
zero lower bound scenario, we find that output declines by 0.2%. Using (1), this can be traced
directly to the first entry of our sufficient statistic—the covariance between current-period
MPCs and the distributional shock—which we show is also 0.2%, both in our model and in
data from the Italian Survey of Income and Wealth. We obtain similar results under several
alternative monetary rules, including a rule that holds real interest rates constant and conventional Taylor rules unconstrained by the ZLB. The key is limited monetary feedback: as long
2 In this notation, the usual notion of MPC is MPC , which measures the marginal propensity to consume within
i0
the same period out of a one-time income shock.

as monetary policy does not adjust rates too aggressively in response to inequality shocks, the
partial equilibrium decline in consumption translates directly into a general equilibrium fall in
output of about the same magnitude.
We next consider a case where the same rise in inequality is permanent. Here, we show
that the source of rising inequality is crucial: if it comes from fixed effects, which permanently
make some households richer than others, long-run effects are minimal. This is a result of
standard assumptions about household utility, which make long-run behavior invariant to the
scale of income. On the other hand, if rising inequality is associated with higher income risk
and volatility, in our benchmark the shock results in a 2% decline in steady-state output, ten
times larger than the impact effect in the short-run case. As before, this decline only occurs
when the interest rate response is constrained—in the neoclassical case, there is instead a mild
long-term output increase from capital accumulation.
To understand the causes of this 2% decline, we derive a steady-state version of the decomposition in (1). We show that consumption is no longer a good partial equilibrium measure: in
the long run, all agents consume exactly their income. Instead, what matters is the impact on
long-run household asset demand. Our sufficient statistic is the elasticity of this asset demand
to idiosyncratic income risk, for which we find the model matches standard estimates (e.g.,
Carroll and Samwick 1997). Interestingly, this elasticity is higher for the persistent component
of income risk than the transitory one—so while dispersion in fixed effects doesn’t matter for
aggregate demand, the inequality created by persistent shocks matters a great deal.
Aside from monetary policy, several key forces shape the general equilibrium multiplier. In
our benchmark, capital plays a strong amplification role: in a version of the “paradox of thrift”,
rising asset demand leads to a decline in output, triggering a fall in investment that pushes
down asset supply even further. Fiscal policy, by contrast, is stabilizing. Under our calibrated
fiscal rules, the government runs deficits in response to recession, which accumulate to increase
the supply of assets and mitigate the output decline. Perhaps the most subtle effect comes from
the endogenous change in income distribution, where our mechanism can potentially feed back
on itself. Evidence from Guvenen et al. (2017) shows that rich and poor workers have incomes
more sensitive to recessions than workers in the middle—leading to a feedback that could in
principle have either sign, but turns out quantitatively to be stabilizing.
We show that long-run outcomes are quite sensitive to these forces underlying the multiplier. In fact, in a simple alternate calibration where fiscal policy maintains constant debt and
spending, and all earners are equally affected by recession, the long-run output effect is vastly
larger, at -24%. This catastrophic outcome reveals the instability of economies suffering from
secular stagnation, and the importance of mitigating forces like fiscal policy. The same holds
true for short-run outcomes, albeit to a much lesser degree: for instance, without countercyclical fiscal policy, our short-run multiplier rises above one.
Moving beyond our main quantitative experiment, we use the model to study other ef-

4

fects of inequality. First, we investigate the extent to which the observed increase in income
inequality might have contributed to the decline in real interest rates observed since the 1980s.
Assuming this increase was associated with a rise in idiosyncratic income risk, we find that
inequality contributed around 80bps to the real interest rate decline—about a fifth of the four
percent decline that Laubach and Williams (2015) estimate for this period.
Second, we use the model to study the impact of long-run shifts in income between labor
and capital. An influential conjecture made informally by Krugman (2016) and Summers (2015)
is that the decline in the labor share may be detrimental to aggregate demand. We show that
this argument is incorrect in our model. Since a long-run rise in the capital share increases the
supply of assets relative to desired savings out of labor income, it is ultimately expansionary,
regardless of whether it comes from a rise in markups or a change in technology. This reinforces
our message that the output effects of inequality may not be as large as commonly assumed,
and that the underlying drivers of the rise in income inequality matter a great deal.
In the literature, other papers have studied the macroeconomic effects of increasing inequality over time, including on interest rates (for example Favilukis 2013, Kaymak and Poschke
2016), household debt (Iacoviello 2008), and welfare (Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante 2010).
One potential source of rising inequality, household-level fixed effects, has little impact in our
model because intertemporal utility is homothetic; relaxing this assumption, Kumhof, Rancière
and Winant (2015) argue that a decline in aggregate consumption can result. Straub (2017)
provides evidence to support such non-homotheticity and further explores its macroeconomic
consequences. We find the homothetic benchmark appealing, but non-homotheticities may
provide another route to similar results.3
The papers mentioned above, like most of the literature, study equilibria with flexible
prices. By contrast, we introduce nominal rigidities and are able to evaluate the output effects of
inequality directly. Two other papers have a related approach. Athreya, Owens and Schwartzman (2017) study the aggregate effect of redistribution, as in our short-run experiments, and
Bayer et al. (2017) study the effect of shocks to household income risk, as in our long-run experiments.4 The first paper emphasises the role of heterogeneity in marginal propensities to
work. Motivated by empirical evidence that finds little evidence for this heterogeneity, we shut
down this channel and focus instead on heterogeneity in marginal propensities to consume.5
The second paper also shuts down this channel, but does so using Greenwood, Hercowitz and
Huffman (1988) preferences, which lead to extremely large multipliers as a side effect when
3 It is worth noting, however, that household-level fixed effects are less plausible in our infinite-horizon framework: interpreting infinitely-lived households as dynasties as suggested by Boar (2017), fixed effects effectively rule
out mean reversion across generations.
4 Relatedly, Basu and Bundick (2017) study contractionary aggregate risk in a representative agent model.
5 A central paper in this literature is Cesarini, Lindqvist, Notowidigdo and Östling (2017), which using evidence
from lotteries finds negligible marginal propensities to earn, and no evidence of heterogeneity according to income.
We discuss this further in appendix D.1.

combined with nominal rigidities.6
Our paper unifies the treatment of redistribution and income risk within a single model.
For both, our methodology separates the role of general equilibrium multipliers from partial
equilibrium impulses, corroborating the latter with micro data.
The emphasis on nominal rigidities places our paper as part of a rapidly growing literature
that adds these rigidities to heterogeneous-agent models.7 A closely related literature has used
sufficient statistics to bring the predictions of these models in line with existing evidence from
micro data (Auclert 2017, Berger et al. 2018). By demonstrating how to embed these sufficient
statistics into a general equilibrium analysis, we hope to provide further empirical discipline for
heterogeneous-agent models. We also employ a novel and efficient Newton-based algorithm
to solve for general equilibrium paths, which we believe may be useful for the literature going
foward.
Finally, our assumption of downward nominal wage rigidities and the possibility of depressed output in a long-run steady state relates our paper to the literature on secular stagnation, inaugurated by Eggertsson et al. (2017). We complement their results by quantifying the
general equilibrium forces that can either amplify or mitigate secular stagnation—including the
roles of capital, countercyclical fiscal policy, and endogenous inequality. Our paper is the first
to consider secular stagnation in the canonical Bewley (1977) incomplete-markets environment,
and also the first to compute the full transition dynamics when the wage rigidity constraint is
binding.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the model and
calibration. Sections 3 and 4, which contain our main quantiative experiments, study the effect
of shocks to labor income inequality that are temporary and permanent, respectively. Section
5 investigates the role of rising inequality in the falling natural real interest rate since 1980.
Section 6 examines the consequences of a change in the labor share. Section 7 concludes.

Households.

We consider a population of infinitely-lived households who face idiosyncratic,

but no aggregate, risk. Each household i has a permanent type ωi ∈ Ω, and in each period t,

it also has an idiosyncratic state σit ∈ S . σit follows a Markov process with transition matrix

Λ (ωi ). The mass of households of each type ωi is ρ(ωi ), and we assume that within each ω,

at all times, the mass of households in each idiosyncratic state σ is equal to the probability
λ (σ ) of σ in the ergodic distribution induced by Λ (ω ). Hence there is always a mass µ (sit ) =

Two assets are available for intertemporal trade: one-period risk-free real bonds bit , and
shares vit , which are claims to firm dividends. Each share costs pt at time t and delivers a
stream of dividends {ds } starting at s = t + 1. Households have perfect foresight over pt , dt ,
and the real interest rate rt . They may invest any amount in bonds and shares provided that
they keep their net worth ait ≡ bit + pt vit positive at all times. No arbitrage by unconstrained

agents implies that the relation

1 + rt =

p t +1 + d t +1
pt

(3)

holds at all times along the perfect-foresight path, and households are indifferent between holding bonds and shares.
Upon an unexpected shock at the end of period t, pt+1 and dt+1 no longer satisfy (3) and
we need to know household porfolios to determine the implied wealth revaluations. At such
times, we assume that households have allocated the fraction θ ( a) of their wealth a to shares
pv, and in our calibration we infer θ ( a) directly from data on household balance sheets.
We specify household income in two steps. First, pre-tax labor income zit is given by the
product of the real wage

Wt
Pt

and the amount of endowment that households are able to supply:
zt (sit ) =

Wt
· Lt · γ (sit , Lt ) · et (sit )
Pt

(4)

γ (s, 1) = 1

(5)

where the γ function satisfies

∀s

Households’ full idiosyncratic labor endowment is eit , and since there is no disutility from
labor, this is the amount that they choose to supply in the case of full employment (Lt = 1). As
per the standard formulation in the literature, their pre-tax income is then given by

Wt
Pt eit .

Because of downward nominal wage rigidities, the economy may experience a labor demand shortfall, with Lt < 1. In that case, the labor market experiences rationing, and a household in state s is constrained to supply the fraction Lt γ (s, Lt ) of his full endowment, with Lt
describing the aggregate impact of employment conditions and γ the distributional impact of

7

these conditions. More specifically, we normalize the γ function so that
E [γ (sit , L) et (sit )] = 1
and hence that E [zit ] =

Wt
Pt Lt

∀ L ≤ 1, ∀t

(6)

at all times. When γ (s, Lt ) = 1, for all s, the labor supply of

all households is proportionally rationed. By contrast, when γ (s, Lt ) 6= 1 for some s, labor
demand shortfalls can be a source of endogenous change in inequality.

Our specification of the γ function allows us to flexibly parametrize the incidence of changes
in labor demand across the population. In particular, using this formulation, we are able to
calibrate our model to directly match Guvenen et al. (2017)’s empirical evidence on ‘worker
betas’—the exposures of gross worker earnings to GDP conditional on their place in the earnings distribution.8 A leading alternative in the literature is to drop (4)–(5) and keep households
on their labor supply curves at all times, so that recessions correspond to optimal responses
of workers to falls in real wages. In appendix D.1, we explain why this alternative approach
is either inconsistent with microeconomic evidence on marginal propensities to earn (when
preferences are separable) or with macroeconomic evidence on government spending multipliers (when wealth effects on labor supply are shut down). A more complex alternative is to
microfound the γ function with a search and matching model of the labor market.9 Similar
to Werning (2015), our simpler formulation preserves the core insights of these models while
maintaining the rich consumption dynamics of an unrestricted Bewley (1977) model.
The income yit that enters household’s budget constraint is post-tax. We assume that the
government runs an affine tax system:
yt (sit ) = Tt + (1 − τt ) zt (sit )

(7)

where Tt is a common tax intercept and τt a common marginal tax rate.10 As we show in
appendix B.3, this provides a good approximation to the U.S. tax and transfer system.
Final goods firm.

The final good Yt has price Pt and is produced by a competitive final good

sector using the Cobb-Douglas technology
Yt = F (Kt−1 , Lt )
8 Note

(8)

that adjustment in our model happens along the intensive margin, with the fraction of individuals within
each state s remaining constant at µ (s) while their gross income varies with L. We treat all households within a
given income state s as if they are equally affected by changes in aggregate conditions; alternative assumptions
would imply even greater individual income risk than the already high level implied by our model.
9 See Ravn and Sterk (2017), Challe, Matheron, Ragot and Rubio-Ramirez (2017), or den Haan, Rendahl and
Riegler (2018) for examples of such a formulation.
10 Because we assume that labor supply is inelastic, the tax rate τ in our model is not distortionary. We abstract
t
away from the efficiency costs of taxes to better focus on their effect on the income distribution.

In steady state, capital is constant at K with q = 1, and marginal product FK (K, L) equals user
cost r + δ. Away from steady state, adjustment costs slow down the period-by-period change
in capital in response to fluctuations in the cost of capital rt and employment Lt .
Given the unit mass of shares outstanding overall, the price of shares at time t is given by
the value of installed capital, pt = qt Kt . Hence, all firm earnings are capitalized into the value
of assets that household trade.12
Wage rigidities.

Following Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016) and Eggertsson et al. (2017), we

introduce a role for monetary policy and the possibility of equilibrium slumps in our model by
assuming that the economy-wide nominal wage can only fall by a limited amount each period:
Wt ≥ κWt−1

(11)

for some 0 < κ ≤ 1.13 When labor demand falls short of the aggregate endowment because the

constraint (11) is binding, households are rationed (Lt < 1) and are each constrained to supply
the fraction Lt γ (sit , Lt ) of their labor endowment.
As discussed in appendix D.1, our choice of wage rigidities resolves several counterfactual implications of the leading models in the literature, which tend to assume price rigities
instead.14 The wage Phillips curve embodied in (11) is a stylized one: recessions are times
11 Because

of perfect foresight and the absence of aggregate risk, future dividends are unambiguously discounted
at the sequence of real interest rates rt .
12 This approach avoids the need to set-up an ad-hoc rule for the distribution of dividend income, as is typically
done in the literature.
13 Note that individual wages always rise and fall due to movements in idiosyncratic productivity. Equation (11)
only holds at the aggregate level and reflects a constraint on an allocative price, but it cannot directly be mapped to
individual data.
14 Another counterfactual implication of models with price rigidities is that they lead to very countercyclical profit
margins. With heterogeneity, these in turn have large distributional consequences that are not directly supported

9

when the wage deflation rate is equal to κ − 1, irrespective of the size or duration of the slump.

This simplification allows us to introduce a role for monetary policy in the canonical model of
consumption in the simplest possible way.
Fiscal policy.

The fiscal authority chooses the lump sum Tt , the marginal tax rate on labor

income τt , government spending Gt and the level of bonds Bt subject to the flow budget constraint

Lt + Bt = Gt + (1 + rt−1 ) Bt−1 + Tt

Yss
Yss

(13)

Bt − Bt−1
B − Bss
= −eDL ( Lt − Lss ) − eDB t−1
Yss
Yss

(14)

where Yss , Lss , and Bss represent the initial steady-state levels of output, employment and
bonds, respectively. These specifications are inspired by the large theoretical and empirical
literature on fiscal rules (Leeper 1991, Bohn 1998). Since Ricardian equivalence fails in our
model, the deficit rule matters independently of the government spending rule.
The government’s tax adjustment rule also matters. We assume that the government earmarks an exogenous fraction τtr of aggregate labor income
lowers Tt by

τtr

Wt
Pt Lt

for the lump-sum Tt , and then

dollars for each dollar of revenue it needs to raise in each period:
Tt = τtr

Combining (7) with (12)–(15) and defining τt ≡

τt −τtr
1−τtr

(15)

as the endogenous fraction of labor

income used towards government revenue, it is easy to check that net labor income is equal to
g
yit = 1 − τt (τtr E I [zit ] + (1 − τtr ) zit )

(16)

The rate τtr ∈ [0, 1] is therefore a simple measure of the degree of progressivity of the tax
system. We hold τ r fixed in all of our benchmark experiments. Equation (16) then shows that

any change in government revenue, through its endogenous effect on τt , affects household
net-of-tax incomes yit in proportion.

Monetary policy.

The central bank controls the nominal interest rate it on nominal bonds.15

Perfect foresight implies that the real interest rate is
1 + rt =

1 + it
1 + π t +1

where πt+1 is the rate of price inflation, 1 + πt+1 ≡

Pt+1
Pt .

(17)
We consider three specifications of

monetary policy. Under neoclassical policy, the central bank sets a path for it that is consistent
with Lt = 1 for all t. In doing so, it achieves a path rt∗ for the real interest rate, and the economy
behaves as if the wage rigidity constraint (11) was absent. We follow the literature and call rt∗
the ‘natural interest rate’ path. Under constant-r policy, the central bank targets a real rate that
is constant at the economy’s steady-state natural rate, rt = r ∗ , and does not change this target
in response to any of our experiments. This policy shuts off all equilibriating real interest rate
movements, including those driven by changes in expected inflation. Finally, our benchmark
monetary policy is one in which the monetary authority sets the nominal interest rate according
to a Taylor rule subject to the zero lower bound,
it = max i, (1 + r ∗ )(1 + π ∗ )

where r ∗ is the steady state natural rate, π ∗ is the inflation target, φ > 1 and we set i = 0

calibrated exercises, the zero lower bound in (18) will always be binding.

2.2

Equilibrium

We model inequality changes as affecting the way endowments are distributed across individuals in different states sit = (ωi , σit ), through the time-varying function et (sit ). We also
consider experiments where the redistributive tax rate τtr varies exogenously, generating exogenous movements in post-tax income inequality. We define equilibrium as follows.
Definition 1. Given initial capital K−1 and nominal wages W−1 , a sequence of exogenous
shocks {et (·) , τtr }, and an initial joint distribution Ψ−1 (s, b, v) over idiosyncratic states, bonds

and stocks, an equilibrium is a set of aggregate quantities {Ct , It , Kt , Yt , Lt , dt }, prices {rt , pt , qt , Pt , Wt },

follows its monetary policy rule, the Fisher equation (17) holds, the distribution of households

bonds can formally be introduced as assets in zero net supply that can be traded by households.
Condition (17) is then an equation of no arbitrage between nominal and real bonds. Implementation issues are

Equilibrium uniqueness.

Our model is a one-asset heterogeneous agent New Keynesian

model, for which general results on equilibrium uniqueness do not yet exist. In appendix
C.3, we numerically verify uniqueness for both the steady state and transition paths in the
neighborhood of the steady state in our baseline calibration.16 We also provide some useful
sufficient conditions for steady state uniqueness under all three monetary rules.

2.3

Calibration

Table 1 summarizes our calibration parameters. We capture the recent US macroeconomic condition of very low real interest rates. We choose 2013 as our base year, since this is the last
year for which household-level balance sheet data is available from the Survey of Consumer
Finances (SCF), and income inequality data is available from Song et al. (2016). Average 10year TIPS yields over that year were 0.07%.17 We therefore set r = 0. Since unemployment
in 2013 averaged 7.4%, while the long-term natural rate of unemployment calculated by the
CBO averaged 5.0%, we assume that the economy is at mildly depressed employment, setting
Lss = (1 − 0.074)/(1 − 0.050) ≈ 0.975. We also assume that the zero lower bound on nomi-

nal interest rates is binding: i = 0. Together, these assumptions imply zero steady state price
inflation (π ∗ = 0), and therefore zero steady-state wage inflation (κ = 1).
Household parameters.

We follow the literature practice of setting the elasticity of intertem-

poral elasticity of substitution in consumption at ν =

1
2

and calibrating β to hit our target for

the real interest rate.
We choose a process for skills sit and our incidence function γ to be consistent with evidence
from US W2s recently documented by Guvenen, Song and coauthors. Specifically, we pick sit
so that the steady-state endowment process is the sum of three orthogonal components:
log eit = ωi + ξ it + χit

(19)

where ωi represents an individual fixed effect, ξ it a transitory component, and χit a persistent
component of earnings risk.
We take the processes ξ it and χit from Kaplan et al. (2016), who capture the higher-order moments of the distribution of earnings changes from US W2s documented by Guvenen, Ozkan
and Song (2014). This process involves substantially more idiosyncratic risk than typical calibrations based on AR processes with normal innovations.
We then pick a calibration for fixed effects ωi to hit exactly the cross-sectional standard
deviation of earnings levels in 2013, as documented by Song et al. (2016).18 It turns out that ωi =
0 is enough to do this—in other words, the accumulation of income risk captured by our income
process is enough to explain the entire cross-sectional dispersion in 2013 U.S. male earnings.
This is consistent with a broad interpretation of earnings risk as spanning generations, with
existing income inequality reflecting the slow accumulation of luck across dynasties.19
To calibrate our incidence function γ, we use the worker beta evidence from Guvenen et al.
16 Multiplicity

is possible under certain parameters, see appendix D.6.
B.1 provides details of all sources for our calibration.
18 Their sample is that of workers in establishment with at least 20 employees.

(2017). The incidence is U-shaped across the income distribution, with the bottom and the top
of the income distribution being most exposed to an decline in aggregate employment. We also
consider two alternative calibrations: one in which recessions have equal incidence (γ = 1)
and one in which the standard deviation of log gross earnings has a constant negative elasticity
with respect to employment, reflecting countercyclical earnings risk as in Storesletten, Telmer
and Yaron (2004). Appendix B.2 provides more details on our calibration of γ.
We pick our aggregates B and K to be consistent with both Survey of Consumer Finances
(SCF) and Flow of Funds data. From the 2013 SCF, we back out a smooth distribution θ ( a)
representing the average fraction of wealth invested in shares for individuals with wealth a,
which we use to calculate portfolio revaluations after unexpected shocks.
Production parameters. We calibrate to a Cobb-Douglas production function, F (Kt−1 , Lt ) =

AKt1−−1α Lαt . We calibrate the capital share such that 1 − α = (r + δ) YK . Given our choice for r, the
2013 NIPA data for δ and YK imply a high labor share of α = 87.2%, which is natural for a model
without an equity premium. Similarly, we understate the investment ratio in the data, which is
natural for a model without growth.
We set the elasticity of investment to q to e I = 1, consistent with Gilchrist and Himmelberg
(1995)’s estimates of the relationship with between aggregate investment and Tobin’s Q.20
Fiscal and monetary policy rules.

We calibrate our redistributive tax rate τ r using data from

the Congressional Budget Office (2013), and the parameters eGL , eDL , and eDB of the fiscal rules
(13)-(14) to be consistent with the empirical fiscal rules literature and our own estimated rules.
We then derive τ g residually from the government budget constraint. Appendix B.3 provides
details.
Steady-state distributions of consumption, income and wealth.

As appendix B.4 illustrates,

our benchmark steady state achieves an excellent fit to the distributions of consumption, income, and wealth reported in the 2013 SCF. In particular, our calibration matches all three Gini
coefficients exactly, and only misses the very top of the income and wealth distributions. This is
a large improvement over standard calibrations of Aiyagari models (see for example Quadrini
and Rıos-Rull 1997), owing mainly to the richer earnings dynamics of our model.

2.4

Experiments: inequality changes

As figure 1 illustrates, income inequality—measured here as the standard deviation of male
log earnings—has been rising in the United States since at least the beginning of the 1980s.
This rise in inequality has been the subject of a very extensive literature, which has identified
20 Their table 1 report a range of 0.027 to 0.063 for δe , depending on the sample. Our calibration falls in the middle
I
of this range and is consistent with typical business cycle models such as Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999).

multiple fundamental causes, all of which can be argued to have changed the innate earnings
ability et (sit ) of individuals in different groups sit .21 Since our framework is concerned with the
change in aggregate consumption and savings patterns induced by this increase in inequality,
we do not need to explicitly model the root cause of this change, and can instead focus directly
on how et changed over time for different groups—consistent with the approach taken by the
large literature on earnings dynamics.
Specifically, we modify the steady-state income process (19), for t ≥ 0, to read
e i + At ξ it + Bt χit − Ct
log eit = ω

(20)

fi and deterministic trends At , Bt . These trends are calibrated to achieve
for a new distribution ω

a given target path for the standard deviation of the log endowment distribution, sd (log eit ),
while the constant Ct enforces a constant mean endowment E [eit ] = 1. Figure 1 plots two of
our target paths, which each achieve an increase of 4 points in the standard deviation of log
endowments, but one is immediately reversed while the second is permanent.22
As initially argued by Gottschalk and Moffitt (1994) and since confirmed by Kopczuk, Saez
and Song (2010) and many others, statistical decompositions of changes in inequality tend to
attribute a role for both the the persistent and the transitory component of earnings risk. Cone i = 0. Howsistent with this evidence, our baseline experiment sets At = Bt and maintains ω
ever, the view that fixed effects have played no role is not universal (see for example Straub
2017). This distinction turns out to be especially important when analyzing the long run. In

as well as fundamental changes in labor market institutions.

Inequality in the short run

We start by investigating increases in inequality in the short run. In our setup, a purely transitory increase in inequality is the same as a one-time redistribution of income. Hence, this
section provides a general characterization of the effects of exogenous income redistribution,
both in partial and in general equilibrium.

3.1

Partial equilibrium effect

We consider first the effect of redistributive labor income shocks, defined as follows.
Definition 2. A redistributive labor income shock is an unexpected change in et (·) or in τtr . We

say the shock is one-time if only e0 (·) or τ0r is affected, and that it is transitory if et (·) and τtr limit

to their initial steady state values.
Both types of redistributive labor income shock operate by changing the distribution of
net incomes yit . For example, in partial equilibrium starting from a full employment steady
state, a small one-time endowment shock affects the date-0 net income of individuals in state
si0 by dyi0 (si0 ) ≡ (1 − τ ) W
P de0 ( si0 ). Similarly, a small one-time contractionary redistributive
r
tax change dτ0 < 0 affects the net income of an individual with current income yi0 by dyi0 =
dτ r

(E [yi0 ] − yi0 ) 1−τ0 r , expanding the distribution linearly away from its mean.
We now characterize the effect of these shocks on the partial equilibrium consumption path
chosen by households. A formal definition of these paths is given in appendix A.2: it is the
solution to the household problem, taking into account the exogenous shocks {et (·) , τtr } but
holding all other inputs into the household problem constant at their steady state values. These
paths are useful for two reasons: first, they can be interpreted as the small open economy
outcome of redistributive shocks. Second, they are a direct determinant of the closed economy
general equilibrium outcome, as we will show in theorem 4.
For any vector X, define NPV (X) = ∑ 1 t Xt as the net present value of that vector dis(1+r )
counted using the steady-state interest rate.

Figure 2: Partial equilibrium effect of increasing inequality
Proposition 3. In response to a one-time redistributive labor income shock, the partial equilibrium
change in the path for Ct is given, to first order, by
∂Ct = Cov I ( MPCit , dyi0 )
where MPCit is i’s spending at date t of date 0 income. In particular, NPV (∂C) = 0.
Proposition 3 shows the precise sense in which the distribution of marginal propensities to
consume is important to determine the effect of a rise in inequality. Its final statement follows
from the fact that
NPV (MPCi ) = 1

∀i

(21)

In other words, all agents have an equal MPC of 1 once expressed in present value terms. The
aggregate effects of income redistribution arise because agents are heterogeneous in the way
they wish to time their spending of additional income, but an intertemporal budget constraint
implies that they all spend this income at some point in time.
According to proposition 3, different types of inequality shocks affect aggregate consumption in different ways. For example, as discussed above, changes in the redistributive tax rate
τ0r expand the distribution of net incomes linearly around its mean level. Applying proposition
3 for this particular distribution of dyi0 , we obtain
∂Ct = Cov I ( MPCit , yi0 )

dτ0r
1 − τr

The covariance between MPCs and net incomes is directly relevant to understand the equilibrium impact of such a shock. For more general shocks, such as for our baseline experiment, we
need to know how the income changes induced by the shock correlate with marginal propensities to consume.23
Figure 2 illustrates proposition 3 in the context of our main short-run experiment. That

experiment redistributes income from agents with high current MPCs to agents with low current MPCs, implying a fall in consumption for a number of periods. As a result, the economy
accumulates assets, and aggregate consumption actually increases after around 10 years.
Quality of approximation.

The key benefit of proposition 3 is that it gives us a potentially

powerful way of connecting a model object to an object in the data. But how important are
nonlinearities? Figure 3 shows the quality of our first-order approximation for both our main
inequality shock and a redistributive tax change, by looking at the first component of the response ∂C0 when we vary the size of the shocks. We focus on the first entry of the sufficient
statistic, ∂C0 , since it is the dominant effect—which, as section 3.3 will explain, carries over
to general equilibrium. The current marginal propensity to consume, MPCi0 , is also the MPC
most readily available in data.
The left panel shows the effect of changing the year-0 standard deviation of log earnings
labelled dσ, and the right panel does the same for a redistributive tax change of a given size
dτ r . As is clear from the figure, the approximation is excellent, including for very large shocks.
The aggregate nonlinearities generated by the concavity of the consumption function are small
enough that the first order approximation provides a useful map between model and data.
Sufficient statistic evaluation.

We are ready to use proposition 3 to compare our results to

those in the data. Our data comes from the Italian Survey of Income and Wealth. We use this
survey because it is, to our knowledge, the highest quality survey that contains individuallevel information on both MPCs and income, therefore enabling us to compute the covariance

Table 2: Sufficient statistics, data vs. model; linear vs. nonlinear
directly. Appendix B.1 contains details on our treatment of the data.24
Table 2 shows how the magnitudes compare for the three types of redistributive income
shocks mentioned thus far. We see that our model does very well at capturing the relevant
joint moments of MPCs and incomes in the data. This makes us confident that the partial
equilibrium effect we obtain in the model accurately captures the consumption effect of income
redistribution in practice, both in terms of general time path (down, then up) and in terms of
magnitude on impact (since it matches the date-0 sufficient statistic.) Our main conclusion is
that these magnitudes are small for plausible changes in income inequality. Note, however, that
this result is conditional on the types of income-based redistribution we consider here: each
redistributive shock has its own sufficient statistic, and both model and data feature significant
MPC heterogeneity along other dimensions.

3.2

General equilibrium

The previous section confirmed common intuitions about the partial equilibrium effects of increases in income inequality. It showed the precise sense in which the covariance between
MPCs and income matters, and showed that our baseline calibration is in line with available
information in the data.
However, it is clear that the relationship between income inequality and output is ultimately a general equilibrium question. Figure 4 plots the effect under our three monetary
policy rules.
In the ZLB and constant-r cases, the results resemble partial equilibrium: output falls on impact by a magnitude similar to consumption, as investment and government spending are little
changed. In the neoclassical case, by contrast, outcomes are reversed in general equilibrium:
there is a small positive effect on the path of output. A decline in real interest rates mitigates the
decline in consumption and elicits a rise in investment, creating enough demand to maintain
full employment. Higher investment accumulates to a larger capital stock, leading to a slight
rise in output after the first period.
Figure 4 therefore illustrates that the response of real interest rates is crucial in determining
24 The SHIW MPCs are self-reported measures of marginal propensities to consume. Parker and Souleles (2017)
has recently shown that these measures tend to correlate highly with estimates from actual behavior in surveys.
Similar magnitudes for the covariance between MPCs and income using alternative sources of identification for
MPCs can be found in US data (Auclert 2017) and in Norwegian data (Fagereng, Holm and Natvik 2016).

Figure 4: General equilibrium
whether partial equilibrium effects carry over to general equilibrium. The decline in aggregate consumption demand from an inequality shock will cause a decline in output unless real
interest rates fall by enough—in this case, an immediate decline of 20 basis points. In our
benchmark case, the zero lower bound prevents this decline, but many alternative monetary
policy rules would deliver a similar output decline. For instance, we show that is the case for
typical calibrations of Taylor rules in appendix D.4.

Figure 5: Increase in income inequality: from partial to general equilibrium
where MPKt ≡ FK (Kt−1 , Lt ). Hence, the effect on net investment reflects the combination of a
cost of capital effect (drt ) and an effect on the marginal product of capital (dMPKt ).

In the neoclassical case, the decline in r dominates, leading to a rise in investment. In both
the ZLB and the constant-r cases, by contrast, the real interest rate is roughly unchanged, so the
investment response is driven by the marginal product of capital, which declines endogenously
due to the fall in employment. Since net saving in the economy equals net investment, this
implies that net saving must decline in equilibrium. This is the paradox of thrift described by
Keynes (1936): while the shock to inequality raises saving in partial equilibrium, it lowers
saving in general equilibrium.25

3.3

From partial to general equilibrium: the multiplier methodology

A striking feature of constant-r and ZLB experiments is that the general equilibrium output
effect looks similar to the partial equilibrium consumption effect, with a similar time path and
magnitude. In the following theorem, we generalize this observation by establishing that there
exists a precise mapping between partial and general equilibrium outcomes, and that this mapping is close to the identity for constant-r and ZLB policy.
Theorem 4. There exists an output multiplier matrix GY such that, for any transitory redistributive
labor income shock, the impulse response of output to that shock is given, to first order, by
dY = GY · ∂C

(23)

where ∂C is the partial equilibrium consumption effect of the shock, which satisfies NPV (∂C) = 0.
The theorem says that redistributive labor income shocks affect output only through their
partial equilibrium effect ∂C, and that this effect works through a matrix GY that is inde25 Although private saving rises, this is more than offset by public deficits due to countercyclical fiscal policy. As
we will see in section 3.4, this fiscal policy actually mitigates the decline in output, and therefore also mitigates the
paradox of thrift.

21

pendent of the shock.26 Theorem 4 therefore conceptually separates the partial equilibrium
question of how inequality shocks affect consumption from the general equilibrium question of how changes in desired consumption affect aggregate outcomes. To obtain the transitory effect of one-time shocks, we can combine proposition 3 and theorem 4 to obtain dY =
GY Cov I (MPCi , dyi0 ).
Figure 5 illustrates the theorem by plotting multipliers GY under our benchmark monetary
policy (ZLB) rule. The left panel reproduces the partial equilibrium shock path from figure
2. The middle panel plots selected rows of the matrix GY . The row for a given time t shows
the weights on the partial equilibrium path ∂C from the left panel that aggregate to produce
dYt . As is clear, GY is fairly close to the identity matrix for this benchmark monetary policy,
with diagonal entries close to 1 and all other entries close to 0. With sufficiently short-lived
partial equilibrium responses, as with the shock we currently consider, these off-diagonal entries can approximately be disregarded. This explains why the partial and general equilibrium
responses look so similar.
There are, however, subtle differences between the two. Most notably, while the partial
equilibrium path has net present value zero—offsetting low consumption in the years following the shock with slightly higher consumption in later years—the general equilibrium path is
strictly negative in every year.

3.4

Determinants of multipliers

We now study how various model parameters and policy affect the general equilibrium response to inequality shocks. To do this, we use the lens of theorem 4: we study aspects of the
model that affect the multiplier matrix GY without altering the partial equilibrium path ∂C,
which remains the same as in figure 5. We focus on the multipliers because they are more sensitive to model uncertainty, in contrast to the partial equilibrium path, which is disciplined by
a sufficient statistic.
Figure 6 displays the effect of changing the monetary rule, the fiscal rule, and the degree
of endogenous inequality as summarized by the γ function. The top panels show the output
multipliers for dY0 , i.e. the first row of GY . The bottom panels show the general equilibrium
output paths.
On the left, we display the effect of changing monetary rules, just as in figure 4. Unsurprisingly, the ZLB and constant-r multipliers are very close to each other, and load on the immediate partial equilibrium impact with a value near one. By contrast, the neoclassical multipliers
are exactly zero, reflecting the fact that, with predetermined capital and full employment, output cannot vary at t = 0.
26 This

is the generalized matrix form of equation (1) discussed in the introduction, which refers to only the first
row of (23). In the proof of theorem 4, we show that an analogue exists for all macroeconomic aggregates, not just
output.

Figure 6: Determinants of multipliers: monetary, fiscal, inequality
In the middle column, we show the effect of progressively less countercyclical fiscal rules.
When the government does not run deficits in response to low employment (eDL = 0), the
effects of inequality shocks are amplified, with a contemporaneous multiplier above one. There
are also significant general equilibrium spillover effects from later dates: the multipliers for
dY0 remain well above zero for ∂Ct with t > 0. Both contribute to a larger general equilibrium
response, as seen in the lower panel. This pattern becomes slightly more pronounced when we
also shut down the response of government spending to employment (eGL = 0).
On the right, we display the effect of alternative income incidence rules γ. First, we compare our benchmark to a case with equal incidence (γ = 1). In our benchmark calibration to
Guvenen et al. (2017) worker betas, both low and high income individuals are relatively sensitive to aggregate income. Since the former have high and the latter have low MPCs, the effect
of counterfactually assuming equal incidence is in principle ambiguous, but quantitatively the
sensitivity of the rich is more important, and hence the equal incidence case has slightly more
amplification. We next consider a rule in which low income states are disproportionately affected by low aggregate employment, leading to countercyclical income risk. This features
still more amplification, an effect that we might call the inequality multiplier: the endogenous
inequality generated by a slump makes the slump even larger.
In conclusion, although procyclical fiscal policy and countercyclical income risk affect the
extent of amplification, the most important driver of general equilibrium outcomes is the monetary rule. In figure 6, neoclassical monetary policy eliminates the output response altogether,
while all other variations in the model alter the output response by no more than 50%.

Persistence

So far we have explored the effect of purely transitory shocks, relating them to a simple sufficient statistic. This sheds considerable light on the effect of income redistribution on output,
and the role played by marginal propensities to consume in this process. However, figure 1
illustrates that the rise in income inequality is not just a transitory phenomenon. It displays a
clear trend, requiring us to consider the effect of persistence.
To do so, we must take a stance on how household income processes are changing. We
address this issue in more detail in the next section. Here, we consider only our main experiment, one that spreads out the persistent and transitory components of earnings equally so as
to achieve a target path for the standard deviation of log incomes. As before, we assume that
this standard deviation increases at t = 0 by 0.04, but this change now persists at a rate ρ > 0:
sd (log et+1 ) − sd (log ess ) = ρ (sd (log et ) − sd (log ess )) + et
Figure 7 plots partial and general equilibrium outcomes as we vary ρ. In partial equilibrium,
increasing persistence implies a more negative immediate consumption effect and a slower
bounce back. As before, this reflects redistribution taking place over a longer time period, as
the incomes of the poor are lower for longer. It also, however, reflects a new channel: the
desire to accumulate precautionary savings in response to the higher income risk associated
with persistent inequality.
In general equilibrium, the effect is larger on impact and much more persistent, especially
as ρ approaches 1. For instance, in the ρ = 0.98 case, the partial equilibrium effect is positive
starting at t = 40, but the general equilibrium effect remains significantly negative even at
t = 100. In terms of the output multiplier matrix GY , this reflects the accumulation of many
off-diagonal entries, which are together nontrivial due to the persistence of the shock.
The most extreme case is that of a permanent increase in inequality ρ = 1, for which general
equilibrium output never recovers, even though partial equilibrium consumption eventually

Inequality in the long run

We now consider the effect of long-run increases in inequality. Our main experiment is now
that of the dashed line in figure 1, and a continuation of the ρ = 1 case of the previous section.
We first consider the partial equilibrium effect, but emphasize the role of asset accumulation
rather than consumption, since our experiments do not affect the latter in the long run. We then
turn to the general equilibrium output effect.

4.1

Partial equilibrium effect

Figure 8 shows the partial equilibrium effect of increasing inequality under our benchmark
scenario and three alternative assumptions about the drivers of the increase in inequality: fixed
effects, the transitory component, or the persistent component of earnings risk.
In each of these scenarios, consumption falls in the short run as agents accumulate assets,
before recovering in the long run. By contrast, aggregate assets accumulate toward a new,
higher steady state. When inequality is caused by increased volatility, the magnitudes are
substantial: assets increase by somewhere between 30 and 45 percent of steady state output
(respectively 8 and 12 percent of steady state assets). By contrast, when inequality is the result
of more dispersed fixed effects, the steady state effects are near zero. The following proposition
sheds light on this result.
Proposition 5. When the tax and transfer system has no lump-sum component (τ r = 0), changes in
fi in equation (20) have no effect on the steady-state levels of assets and
the distribution of fixed effects ω
consumption.

25

Proposition 5 arises from the homotheticity of intertemporal consumption embodied in our
choice of utility u (c) =

−1

c 1− ν
.
1 − ν −1

This homotheticity is the prevalent assumption in models of

consumption and savings behavior, both at the individual and at the aggregate level.27 It is
therefore a useful benchmark to study the consequences of long-run increases in income inequality. Under this assumption, the savings rate is neutral with respect to shocks that scale
up or down the entire after-tax income process. Thanks to our redistributive fiscal rule with
τ r > 0, this neutrality does not quite hold for changes in fixed effects, but figure 8 indicates
that the departure from neutrality is insignificant in practice.
This result shows that the consequences of the observed long run increase in inequality depend on its underlying drivers, and particularly on the distinction between rising fixed effects
and a rising persistent component of earnings risk, which induces the largest asset response in
figure 8. Empirically, this distinction is difficult because existing studies of earnings dynamics
tend to focus on individual earnings trajectories rather than tracking generations over time.
If individual fixed effects are mean-reverting, they may correspond more closely to persistent
shocks in our infinite-horizon setting.28 Distinguishing between these two sources of long-run
increases in inequality is an important question for empirical work going forward.
We now connect to the existing empirical evidence on the effect of

risk on savings to judge whether the magnitudes implied by figure 8 are reasonable. There
exists a long empirical literature on the topic (see Browning and Lusardi (1996) for a survey).
A typical regression in this literature is
log ai = αη s2iη + αe s2ie + βZi + ui

(24)

where ai is individual wealth and Zi are individual-level controls. In (24), αη provides a
weighted average of individual semielasticities of wealth to a change in the variance of innovations to the permanent component of earnings, s2iη , while αe provides the equivalent for

innovations to the transitory component s2ie . These cross-sectional elasticities correspond to the

partial equilibrium outcomes in our model in which aggregates are held constant.29 Hence
the direct counterpart of αη and αe in the model is the partial derivative of log aggregate asset
demand with respect to the innovations to each component x ∈ {η, e} holding income and

number of important entries in the literature, such as De Nardi and Fella (2017), have questioned this homotheticity assumption on the grounds that it cannot account for the savings behavior of the rich. Recently, Straub
(2017) has shown that consumption appears not to scale linearly with permanent income, a sign of aggregate nonhomotheticities. In these models, permanent income inequality can have large effects on aggregate savings in the
long run.

pare the relevant estimates, and show that model and data implications for the semielasticity
of asset demand to persistent income risk are extremely close. By contrast, the model’s implied elasticity of asset demand to transitory income risk is below the data by a factor of 14,
suggesting that, if anything, our large estimates of the effect of inequality on savings are an
understatement of potential empirical magnitudes.
The last column translates this evidence into semielasticities of asset demand with respect
to cross-sectional variance,

To translate these numbers into magnitudes that we will

use in the next section, consider an experiment that increases the cross-sectional standard deviation of log earnings by dσ, and therefore its variance by dσ2 = 1.84dσ. Suppose that the
persistent, the transitory, and the fixed effect components of earnings risk respectively account
for SharePersistent, ShareTransitory, and ShareFixedEffects of this variance increase. Then,
multiplying by 1.84, table 3 implies that the semielasticity of savings to σ is
∂ log Ad
= 2.93 × SharePersistent + 1.78 × ShareTransitory + 0.11 × ShareFixedEffects (25)

assets. We will next show why this number is a sufficient statistic for the long-run outcome.

Steady state in a special case

It is useful to first focus on a special tractable case of the model. While this case may not be
quantitatively realistic, it clearly illustrates the forces that shape long-run employment outcomes, including the roles played by monetary and fiscal policy. This special case modifies our
benchmark calibration to feature:
a) Equal incidence: γ (s, L) = 1 ∀s, L
intergenerational saving motive.
29 By contrast, time series changes in income risk can only be mapped to general equilibrium model outcomes, a
much more difficult task.

As appendix C.2 explains, long-run equilibrium in the model is characterized a single market
clearing equation for the stocks of assets,31
(26)

A = B+K

Under our assumptions, asset demand A and asset supply B + K are, in steady state, both linear
functions of L.
Proposition 6. Assume that a) and b) hold. Then the steady-state real interest rate r and employment
level L jointly solve the equation

long-run neoclassical factor demand conditions.
Figure 9 contrasts the determination of long-run equilibrium under neoclassical monetary

policy (where employment is constant at L = 1 and the real interest rate r adjusts to clear markets), and under ZLB monetary policy (where instead r is fixed and L adjusts to clear markets).
As discussed in the previous section, a rise in inequality raises asset demand at a given level
of r and L. Under neoclassical monetary policy, the real interest rate falls and the capital stock
increases, boosting long-run output. The equilibrating forces at the ZLB are quite different: an
increase in asset demand leads to a decline in employment, which further reduces asset supply as firms readjust their capital stock to bring its marginal product back in line with its cost
r + δ—another manifestation of the paradox of thrift. The equilibrium outcome can be a large
fall in L.
We now examine the quantitative implications of Proposition 6, tying them back to the
magnitude of the asset demand effect of inequality

Corollary 7 provides a simple steady state version of theorem 4. The equilibrium change in
price or quantity depends on the extent to which the asset demand curve shifts (our sufficient
statistic) and on the difference in the semielasticities of asset demand and supply. When it
is employment that adjusts, these semielasticities take a particularly simple form, so that the
multiplier is a function of observables: the sum of the bond to asset ratio ( AB = 15% in our

calibration) and a simple function of the tax rate ( 1−τ τ g = 27%). This leads to an output-on1

of dσ = 0.04 pushes up asset demand by 2.66 × 0.04 ' 10%, inequality therefore implies an

secular stagnation. In the next section, we show how proactive fiscal policy can dramatically

can contrast this 24% output fall with the modest decline in the long-run real interest rate of 21 basis points
under neoclassical monetary policy. Interest rate declines are effective at restoring equilibrium because the long-run
elasticities eD and eS of asset supply and demand are large—a common feature of general equilibrium models that
we discuss further in section 5. This contrast will become less extreme in the next section, as declines in L become
much more effective at restoring equilibrium with our richer fiscal policy and income incidence rules.

Steady state in the general case

Our general model differs from the special case discussed in the preceding section because our
calibrated fiscal rules imply that both government debt and government spending are responsive to falls in employment, and because our calibrated income incidence function γ departs
from the equal incidence benchmark.
Consider first the effect of the fiscal rule, holding income incidence at γ = 1. In a steady
state with employment L below its initial steady state level of Lss , we see from (14) that steadystate bonds B are
B = Bss +

eDL
( Lss − L) .
eDB

Fiscal policy therefore endogenously raises asset supply A = K + B as employment falls. In
our baseline calibration, this effect is powerful enough that the slope of the asset supply curve
changes sign, as illustrated in the left panel of figure 10. This shows the power of expansionary
fiscal policy in sustaining demand in the long run by acting as a source of assets for the economy,33 thereby substituting for the lack of appropriate monetary policy. Quantitatively, this is
a very powerful effect: with our calibrated fiscal rule, equilibrium moves from point S to point
S0 , propping up employment by over 15 points.
Consider next the effect of income incidence. Departing from the γ = 1 benchmark implies
that the asset demand curve is no longer linear in employment, since changes in aggregate
33 The left panel of figure 10 also shows that fiscal policy affects the asset demand curve,

rotating it to the left. The
reason is that steady-state taxes must rise to be consistent with the higher level of government spending. Lower
employment in steady state therefore lowers individuals’ post-tax labor incomes and induces them to save less,
explaining the direction of rotation of the asset demand curve.

30

income now affect the structure of risk that individuals face. Relative to this benchmark, there
are two effects at play when employment falls. If the incomes of low-skill individuals are
affected by more, this could raise aggregate precautionary savings. If the incomes of highskill individuals are affected by more, on the other hand, aggregate savings could fall due
to a wealth effect. As was the case in the short-run, in our calibration to the Guvenen et al.
(2017) worker betas, the effect at the top dominates and is overall mitigating,34 with equilibrium
employment propped up by an extra point.
Just as with equation (29), it is possible to put all of these effects together and obtain a
formula for the aggregate multiplier that translates a given change in asset demand into an
effect on long-run output.

Proposition 8 shows the importance of fiscal policy in mitigating the recession, as well as the
possibly ambiguous effect of income incidence. Quantitatively, ηF = 3 and η I = 1.5. Together,
these forces bring down the output multiplier in (30) from 2.4 in the special case of the previous
section to only 0.21 in our benchmark, shrinking the fall in output to a milder 2.1%.

4.4

Transition dynamics

Figure 11 shows the impulse response to the benchmark long-run income inequality shock under our three monetary policy rules. Once again, the transitions for the constant-r and the ZLB
case are very close, and we have already established that they converge to identical steady
states, with the level of output reduced by 2.1%. The adjustment toward steady state outcomes
for output, consumption, and investment is almost immediate. This is true even though fiscal
policy takes several decades to converge to the new steady state for bonds, and capital disinvestment also takes several decades to run its course.
Under neoclassical policy, by contrast, the transition dynamics of all aggregate variables are
slower. Here, the dominant force is capital accumulation, which absorbs the rise in saving and
leads to higher output in the long run. Since capital is a stock, this accumulation takes place
over many decades, and the real interest rate declines at a similarly slow pace.
34 If,

on the contrary, the precautionary savings effect dominates, it is possible for the asset demand curve to
become backward bending and for multiple equilibria to appear. See appendix D.6 for such an example.

Policy solutions at the zero lower bound

We conclude this section by discussing how various features of the environment affect equilibrium under our benchmark monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound.
We first ask whether wage adjustment can help improve long-run outcomes. One intuition
is that, since the downward rigidity of wages (11) is the root cause of the long-run slump, it
may help to let wages fall faster. As the left panel of figure 12 shows, however, this intuition is
incorrect. The more κ falls, the more depressed long-run employment is—and moreover, this
force is quantitatively very potent: when κ = 0.97 and long-run wages fall at a rate of 3%,
long-run disemployment falls from our benchmark of 4.6% to a dire 33%. The reason is that, in
steady-state, long-run wage deflation implies long-run price deflation, pushing up the steadystate real interest rate and causing a decline in employment. This mechanism is often called the
paradox of flexibility (e.g., Eggertsson 2011 or Werning 2012).
Next, we ask whether introducing an less-than-zero effective lower bound on nominal in-

terest rates can improve outcomes. Many central banks have started implementing negative
nominal rates (see for example Rognlie 2015b). We therefore consider varying i in equation
(18) from its benchmark value of zero to more negative values. The middle panel of figure 12
shows that, in our model, the benefits of breaking through the zero lower bound are quantitatively large. The mechanism here is exactly the reverse of the effect of wage deflation.
Another policy tool that has been proposed to fight the zero lower bound is raising the
inflation target (e.g. Coibion, Gorodnichenko and Wieland 2012). The right panel of figure 12
shows that, indeed, another full employment equilibrium exists in our model provided that the
increase in inflation target is large enough. The logic is that the increase in the inflation target
might achieve a lower equilibrium real interest rate despite the zero lower bound. However,
there is always an equilibrium in which the downward wage rigidity (11) remains binding and
inflation is below the target: the central bank wants inflation but cannot achieve it.35

Inequality and the decline in r ∗

According to Laubach and Williams (2015), there has been a 4 percentage point decline in the
natural interest rate r ∗ since 1980. How much of this can we attribute to rising labor income
inequality? We answer this question by computing the decline in r ∗ implied by our model,
given the observed path of inequality since 1980.
More specifically, we first recalibrate the model to a 1980 steady state, as described in more
detail in appendix B.5. We then feed in the historical path for the standard deviation of log
earnings in the right panel of figure 13 and compute model outcomes, assuming neoclassical
monetary policy so that employment is kept at potential throughout the transition. In this
thought experiment, households become fully informed in 1980 about the new path for inequality, and they assume it will remain at its 2013 level forever. The left panel of figure 13
shows the resulting path for the real interest rate: an eventual fall in r ∗ of 82 basis points, with

the rise in inequality would increase aggregate asset demand, holding everything constant. In
this new calibration, this is

∂ log Ad
∂σ

= 3.11. Next, we can ask how elastic asset demand and asset
supply are to the real interest rate. Our model implies a semielasticity of asset demand eD ' 27
and a semielasticity of asset supply eS ' −16. Putting those numbers together, (28) predicts a
steady-state decline in r ∗ from the observed increase of 12 points in the standard deviation of
log earnings of

basis points, only slightly above what we compute in the model on account of nonlinearities
from the large shock.
This exercise is another application of our sufficient statistic methodology, separating the
general equilibrium outcome into two parts. First, there is the impulse

∂ log Ad
∂σ

× dσ to the asset
demand curve, a partial equilibrium sufficient statistic for the inequality shock that we validated empirically in section 4.1 (assuming that inequality reflects a rise in income risk). Second,
1
there is the general equilibrium multiplier eD −
eS , which tells us how far we need to move along
the asset demand and supply curves to restore equilibrium. Since this multiplier is small, it
converts the fairly substantial impulse to asset demand in (31), a rise of 3.11 × 0.12 ≈ 37%, into
a moderate decline in r ∗ of 82 basis points.
The small multiplier arises from the large interest semielasticities of asset supply and demand in the model. The asset supply semielasticity, eS ' −16, follows directly from the capital
demand implied by our Cobb-Douglas production function.36 The asset demand semielastic36 Explicitly,

A α r +δ , where ε is the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor.

34

ity, eD ' 27, captures the usual long-run interest sensitivity of household savings in Aiyagari
models—which, although there is no longer an infinite elasticity as in a representative agent
model, is still quite high. There is a plausible case for smaller elasticities: for instance, some
of the empirical literature on the production function points to an elasticity of substitution less
than one (implying smaller eS ), and OLG models can feature strong income effects that dampen
or overturn the savings response to interest rates (implying smaller eD ). Either change would
lead to a larger multiplier, and therefore an even larger role for inequality in the long-run r ∗
decline.
We argue that this analysis illustrates the value of our methodology: decomposing via (31)
allows us to identify which features of the model matter most to the general equilibrium outcome. Going forward, the role of asset supply and demand elasticities will be an important
question for the literature on secular stagnation and the natural rate.

Inequality and the labor share

The paper has thus far considered the impact of changes in labor income inequality. Another
key dimension of the income distribution is the split between labor and capital income. The
recent global decline in the labor share is a widely-studied macroeconomic trend, and although
its contribution to overall inequality to date has been much smaller than that from labor income
inequality (see Francese and Mulas-Granados 2015), it may rise in importance going forward.
The model in section 2 features a Cobb-Douglas production function with a fixed labor
share parameter α. It also assumes a perfectly competitive production sector, eliminating the
possibility of rising markups—which recent work has suggested to be a major cause of the declining labor share.37 To study the impact of changes in the labor share, therefore, it is necessary
to enrich the model. We do so along three dimensions: allowing for a general production function, allowing the price of investment to vary, and replacing competitive with monopolistic
production.
Modified production model. The final good is produced by a competitive retail sector that
packages a continuum of intermediate goods x jt :

One unit of the final good can be transformed costlessly into one unit of the consumption
good and 1/Xt units of the investment good. The price of investment is therefore PtI = Xt Pt ,

for investment goods relative to the technology for consumption goods.
Each intermediate good j is produced by a monopolistically competitive firm j, which has
the production function
x jt = F (K jt−1 , L jt )

(33)

where K jt−1 is the capital owned by the firm at the beginning of period t. Capital adjustment

costs remain the same, but must be paid in investment goods. We maintain our assumption
that firm profits are capitalized into the value of assets that households trade. As before, each
firm maximizes the present value of the path of dividends {dt }, with the price Pjt now being

an additional choice variable. Given the demands implied by (32), firms optimally set Pjt equal
to µ times marginal cost, allowing us to interpret µ as a markup.
Assuming all firms are identical initially, they remain identical at all times and their shares

will trade at the same real price pt . For simplicity, we will assume that the only equity asset
traded by households is a composite share of all firms, which also trades at pt . Appendix A.1
shows that pt = qt Xt Kt + Πt , where qt Xt Kt is the value of installed capital and Πt is the present
discounted value of monopoly profits. In steady state, this reduces to

where 1 − µ1 Y is the steady-state flow monopolists’ profit, capitalized into Π at rate r.38

Finally, we assume that the fiscal rules (13) and (14) are normalized by the Y that occurs

in steady state after the shock, rather than by the initial Yss . This keeps the effective stance of
fiscal policy constant as we change the production side of the economy, which is important for
isolating the impact of the labor share.
Steady-state result.

With the newly-enriched model, we can study the effects of three distinct

shocks that influence the labor share: shocks to the production function, investment prices, and
markups.
Proposition 9. Consider an exogenous change in the production function or investment prices, or a
rise in markups, that leads to a decrease in the labor share holding r constant. Under zero lower bound
or constant-r policy, this causes an increase in aggregate employment starting from a depressed steady
state. Under neoclassical policy, it causes a rise in r ∗ .
38 Note that this formula requires r > 0, which is inconsistent with our original calibration to r = 0. Given the
assumptions in this section, r > 0 will always hold in steady-state equilibrium: asset supply (34) approaches infinity
as as r ↓ 0, and equilibrium with asset demand will hold for some strictly positive r. We therefore consider r > 0 in
this section. An earlier version of this paper added an “equity premium” such that asset supply can be finite even
for negative risk-free r.

36

This simple but surprising result provides a unified analysis of the labor share and aggregate demand. The contrast with section 4 is striking: there, a rise in labor income inequality
was contractionary in the long run, while here, a fall in the labor share is expansionary, even
though it also increases overall income inequality.39 The intuition behind proposition 9 is that
a decline in the labor share, by increasing the capital or profit shares, pushes up the total value
of assets supplied by the private sector—and in our framework, an increase in asset supply
relative to demand is expansionary in the long run.40
When thinking about income distribution, therefore, it is important to consider which income streams will be capitalized into tradable assets. This is one instance of a more general
theme in this paper: the effects of inequality on aggregate demand may not be as large as
commonly assumed, and very much depend on the source of that inequality.

7

Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a framework to analyze the effects of changes in the income distribution on consumption and output. We found that transitory income redistribution can lead
to declines in both consumption and output, but that this effect is likely small. By contrast, we
found that the long-run effect of income inequality, if it involves an increase in idiosyncratic
income risk, can potentially be quite large.
There are several important directions for future research. On the theory side, the most
important next step is to better understand the dynamic general equilibrium multipliers in
theorem 4, which here we are only able to compute numerically. We pursue this agenda in Auclert, Rognlie and Straub (2017), relating these multipliers to individual marginal propensities
to consume. On the empirical side, our research calls for better empirical evidence on the relationship between marginal propensities to consume and income, for revived attention on the
empirical magnitude of precautionary savings, and for disentangling the role of fixed effects
relative to persistent income risk in explaining the recent rise in income inequality.

principle, if the elasticity of substitution is extremely high, a markup increase can lead to a decline in capital
demand so large that it overwhelms the rise in capitalized profits, resulting in an asset supply decline. Whenever
this happens, however, there will also be a rise in the labor share. Hence, the conditional statement in proposition 9
holds: as long as rising markups cause a decline in the labor share, they will be expansionary.

Let Jt−1 (Kt−1 ) be the value of firm j with capital Kt−1 at the end of period t − 1. The firm problem is

Baseline model. In the baseline model prior to section 6, we have Xt = 1, and production is competitive rather than monopolistic. The representative firm’s problem in the competitive case, however, is
exactly the same as the monopolist’s problem (35) if we substitute in µt = 1, because then the firm can
sell an unlimited quantity at the market price Pt .
We can therefore apply all results above to the baseline model, simply by substituting Xt = 1 and
µt = 1 everywhere. With qt = Jt0−1 (Kt−1 ), (37) is unchanged

A.2

The household problem



Households maximize E ∑ βt u (cit ) , where u is a common period utility function and β a common
discount factor, subject to the sequence of period budget constraints
cit + bit + pt vit = yt (sit ) + (1 + rt−1 ) bit−1 + ( pt + dt ) vit−1

(2)

bit + pt vit ≥ 0

where the combined state sit ≡ (ωi , σit ) consists of a fixed effect ωi , distributed with masses ρ(ωi ), and
an idiosyncratic state σit that follows an independent Markov process for each household i, with the
Markov transition matrix Λ (ωi ) possibly depending on the household fixed effect.

Simplification. As discussed briefly in section 2, perfect foresight implies that unless there is an
unanticipated shock at t + 1, the return on bonds and shares is equal:
1 + rt =

p t +1 + d t +1
pt

(47)

Wherever perfect foresight holds, therefore, we may define the consolidated asset position
ait ≡ bit + pt vit

(48)

and simplify the household budget constraint (2) using (47) to be
cit + ait = yt (sit ) + (1 + rt−1 ) ait−1

(49)

ait ≥ 0

The household’s problem otherwise remains identical: it merely faces the budget constraint (49) rather
than (2).

Partial equilibrium. We first consider the partial equilibrium determination of aggregate consumption and savings, building from the individual decision problem.

given initial state (si0 , ai,−1 ), and taking paths {yt (s)} and {rt } for the mapping of s to income and the
real interest rate as exogenous.
The solution to the simplified decision problem consists of recursive policy functions ct (s, a) and
a0t (s, a) for consumption ct and assets at as a function of (st , at−1 ). By construction, these policy functions
only depend on {yu (s)}u≥t and {ru }u≥t−1 .
Consider now aggregation. Starting with an initial distribution41 Ψ−1 over households (s0 , a−1 ),
applying the policy functions a0t (s, a) at each t leads to a series of distributions {Ψt }, recursively given
by

Ψt (s0 , a0 ) = ∑ π (s0 |s)Ψt−1 (s, a0−
(50)

s

Each Ψt , by construction, depends on Ψ−1 and the full sequences {yt (s)} and {rt } of the after-tax income
process and real interest rate, through their impact on agents’ policy choices a0t (s, a).
With these distributions, we can find aggregate consumption Ct and assets At

AtPE ({yt {s}}, {rt }, Ψ−1 ) as aggregate partial equilibrium consumption and assets given initial distribution
Ψ −1 .
At a steady state with constant r and income process {y(s)}, the simplified partial equilibrium decision problem yields stationary decision rules css (s, a) and a0ss (s, a). Using the latter in (50) delivers a
distribution Ψss as a fixed point.

obtained by aggregating css ( a, s) and a0ss ( a, s) using the stationary distribution Ψss , as steady state partial
equilibrium consumption and assets.

Next, we examine the general equilibrium determinants of aggregate consumption and assets. There
are two steps in building from the partial equilibrium: first, revaluation effects determine the initial asset
positions, and second, equilibrium effects affect the household income process.

General equilibrium 1: determination of asset positions. In general equilibrium, initial assets
ai,−1 are given by bonds and shares according to
ai,−1 = bi,−1 + p−1 vi,−1

write Ψt (s, a) = Pr(( ait , sit ) : ait ≤ a and sit = s).

obtain the joint distribution over (s0 , bi,−1 , vi,−1 ), we proceed in two steps. First, we back out the share
price pe that ensures market clearing before the shock, that is, pe = EΨe [ a] − B−1 . Next, we assume that
initially, each household i holds a fraction proportional to θ ( ãi ) of its consolidated asset position ãi in
shares p̃vi . We calibrate the function θ (·) to match empirical features of household balance sheets as
explained in appendix B.1. We ensure that the market for shares clears at t = −1 by finding the constant

Calibration details
Main calibration sources

Our 10 year TIPS yield data comes from FRED (series code DFII10). A simple average of daily values
over all days in 2013 delivers 0.07%, leading us to our choice of r = 0%.
Our unemployment data is also from FRED (series code UNRATE). An average over monthly values
in 2013 delivers 7.4%. The long-term natural rate of unemployment as given by the CBO has series code
UNRO in FRED. Its 2013 average was 5%. This leads us to steady-state employment gap estimate of
Lss = 11−−0.074
0.05 = 0.975.
We obtain the overall depreciation rate δ by dividing the total consumption of fixed capital from the
Integrated Macoeconomic Accounts by the total capital stock. From the June 2016 release of the Flow
of Funds accounts,43 we obtain the consumption of fixed capital by adding up lines 2 from tables S.3.a
(households), S.4.a (nonfinancial noncorporate business), S.5.a (nonfinancial corportate businesss) and
S.6.a (financial business). This delivers δK = $2.1trn. The corresponding capital stock K is made of the

value of household real estate (line 98), and nonfinancial assets from the other three sectors (lines 79, 98,
and 100 of their respective tables). This yields K = $53trn, delivering an implied δ = 4%.
We obtain our steady-state value for G
Y by dividing government consumption expenditures and
gross investment in the NIPA (table 1.1.5, line 22) by the headline gross domestic product measure
$3.11trn
(table 1.1.5, line 1). This delivers G
Y = $16.7trn = 18.7%.
We obtain our steady-state value for YB by adding up the flow of funds value of marketable Treasury
and state and local government securities (table L.210, line 2 and table L.212, line 1) and subtracting the
value of treasury securities held by state and local governments and by the rest of the world (table 210,
lines 20 and 53). This delivers YB = $9.25trn
$16.6trn = 55.4%.
To obtain the value of the wealth-to-GDP ratio, we use household wealth data from the Flow of
Funds (table B.101). We sum the value of real estate (line 4), consumer durables (line 8), deposits (line
10), debt securities (line 15), corporate equities (line 25), mutual fund shares (line 26), and proprietors
equity in noncorporate business (line 29). For pension plans, we only include private and public defined
contribution plans (table L.117, line 26), since defined benefit pension plans are completely illiquid.44
We then subtract the value of household mortgage debt (line 34) and consumer credit (line 35). This
K
A
B
delivers YA = $60.5trn
$16.7trn = 363%. We finally compute residually a capital-to-GDP ratio of Y = Y − Y =
3.63 − 0.554 = 307%. Note that this is close to the value of 321% implied by the summing sectoral
capital stocks directly, illustrating the consistency of these two approaches to measuring the capitaloutput ratio.
We calibrate our portfolio shares θ ( a) by using data from
the the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).45 Aggregating up total household net worth ai (financial and nonfinancial assets net of total debt, fin+nfin-debt) using the sample weights delivers aggregate net worth of $64.7trn, or a net-worth-to GDP ratio of 382%, which is again close to our calibration
of YA from the flow of funds data.
There are multiple ways to divide individual household net worth ai into the notions of individual
share holdings pi vi and bond holdings bi in our model, which depend on our interpretation of the data.
We consider three alternatives. A first alternative does not use the SCF data at all and assumes that
all households have the same fraction of shares in total net worth. We label this the uniform portfolio
allocation, θ u ( a) = K
A . A second alternative takes a broad interpretation of shares as including any
wealth that is not in the form of deposits or bonds directly held. For each household i, we sum all
assets held in transactions accounts (liq), savings bonds (savbnd), bonds held directly (bond), and IRA
accounts (irakh) and label these as liquid assets bi . The remainer of net worth, ai − bi , then consistutes
household i’s share holdings pi vi . Our third definition takes a narrow definition of equity, in which we
include only the total value of directly-held equity and equity held through mutual funds (deq), as well
as closely held businesses (bus).
More precisely, we consider the set of households with at least $100 in net worth and group them
by centiles i = 1 . . . 100 of net worth. We then compute total capital holdings pi vi and total net worth ai
in each bin i under both definitions of pi vi , and fit a smooth curve f through the relationship between
pi vi
b
b a
n
n a
ai and log ai . This allows us to back out θ̂ ( a ) = f ( e ) and θ̂ ( a ) = f ( e ). These two distributions,
together with the underlying centile values, are plotted in figure B.1. These curves are passed on to
our model, which rescales them by a factor common to all households, θ b ( a) = Θb θ̂ b ( a) and θ n ( a) =

Individual bond and equity holdings.

benefit pensions are also not recorded in the Survey of Consumer Finances, which we use to back out
household portfolios.

Our narrow capital measure reveals a well-known pattern: the share of wealth invested in stocks
rises quickly with wealth. Once those positions are scaled up by Θn , the richest individuals in the
economy own levered equity claims. We verify that bit + pt vit ≥ 0 in all our simulations, so that we do
not have to deal with cases of bankruptcy.
Our inequality data comes from Song et al. (2016).47 Our main inequality measure
is the standard deviation of log earnings, which is the square root of their variance series for the earnings
of individuals in firms with more than 20 employees (their figure 2(a), top line).

Inequality data.

Our income process is from Kaplan et al. (2016), whose replication material is
available online.48 We import their 33 grid points for log skills (ymarkov_grid.txt) and their 33x33
continuous time transition matrix A (ymarkov_combined.txt), and decompose it into its underlying
components: a 3 point Markov chain for the transitory component and an 11 point Markov chain for the
persistent component of earnings risk. Since their continuous-time matrix is sampled at quarterly frequency, we convert it to a discrete, yearly frequency transition matrix by taking Π = e4A . The moments
generated by this discrete-time earnings process are nearly identical to the moments from Guvenen et
al. (2014) that they target in their income process estimation, as summarized in their table 3.

Income process.

that, since households are indifferent between bonds and shares, θ̂ has no effect on
R the stationary distribution of assets Ψ ( a). Once we have obtained the stationary distribution of assets such that adΨ ( a) = A, we can

therefore back out Θb as the solution to Θb aθ̂ b ( a) dΨ ( a) = K, and similarly for Θn .

As described in section 2.4, our experiments scale the cross-sectional distribution of
log endowments to achieve a target path for sd (log eit ). All of our grids (for the transitory component,
the persistent component, and the fixed effect component of earnings) are symmetric around 0 in logs.
In all of our experiments, we hold the transition matrix Π fixed, spread out points on the grids for
log eit around their common mean of 0 so as to achieve our target for the standard deviation of logs,
and then rescale endowments by a level factor to ensure E [eit ] = 1. Our experiments differ in the grids
that we scale. In our benchmark experiment, we scale the grid for the transitory and the persistent
component by a common factor, while the transitory and the persistent experiment only scale the grids
of these respective components of earnings risk. Finally, in our fixed effect experiment, we discretize the
distribution of log fixed effects by assuming a normal distribution with mean 0 and 20 equally spaced
points, truncated at 4 standard deviations on either side. This final experiment requires us to recompute
the household problem 20 times (one for each discretized level of the fixed effect) and then aggregating
up.

Experiments.

Since detailed data on marginal propensities to consume by income is not available
for the United States, we turn to the Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) used by
Jappelli and Pistaferri (2014).49 Auclert (2017) shows that the correlations between marginal propensities
to consume and income in that survey are consistent with correlations that come out of two U.S. data
sources, but the SHIW has the benefit of providing detailed individual-level MPC information, which
allows to calculate our key sufficient statistic Cov ( MPCi , dyi ) for the same distribution of changes in
income dyi as that featured by our main experiment.
We merge household income information (in the rfam10 dataset) with the MPC information available in the q10e dataset. We take overall income (y) as our income variable yi . The standard deviation
of log y in this dataset is σ = 0.688. We pick a desired increase in this standard deviation dσ = 0.01, and
for each household i, we compute a virtual post-redistribution income measure yi∗

MPC data.

This transormation of income corresponds exactly to our main experiment in the model: note in particular that yi∗ has the same mean as
deviation of its log is σ + dσ. We finally compute

ance is quite insentitive to our initial choice of dσ. We also similarly compute the covariance between
MPCs and income, as well as the difference in income-weighted MPC between the top 10% of income
earners and the bottom 90% of income earners.

Incidence function

We use three methodologies to calibrate our incidence function γ. Our benchmark parametrization
uses data from Guvenen et al. (2017), henceforth GSSY.50 These authors estimate worker GDP betas
by regressing the log earnings growth Δyi,t of individual i in year t on the interaction of log real GDP
growth Δyt and twelve earnings percentile bins (10 to 90, 99, and 99.9). We use their worker betas for

males aged 36–45 (their figure 1, panel a), which is representative of the evidence for other age groups
and for females. These raw betas are reproduced in the dashed line of the left panel of figure B.2. They
are U-shaped in a worker’s earnings level, implying that the earnings of both the poorest and the richest
segments of the population vary more than proportionately with GDP, while the earnings of the middle
percentiles are relatively more insulated.
We map thesecoefficients to our model as follows. Conceptually, the same regression ran in our
γ (s,L) L

for every s, the product of an Okun law coefficient ϑ by the elasticity
model recovers ϑ 1 + γL (s,L)
of gross earnings Lγ with respect to L. We first interpolate the GSSY betas to recover the data betas
for every income state s. We then renormalize those betas by a common fraction such that the incomeweighted beta is one, taking care of the Okun law constant ϑ. This delivers the solid line in the left panel
γ (s,L) L
of figure B.2. We finally obtain our function γ (s, L) by assuming that the elasticity γL (s,L) remains
constant as L increases for given s.
As an alternative and to examine the robustness of our results with respect to this aspect of our
calibration, we consider a simple parametrization of the γ function given by
γ (s, L) =

e (s) Γ log L


E e1+Γ log L

(67)

In this simple one-parameter family of functions, Γ represents the elasticity of the standard deviation of
log gross earnings (a standard measure of inequality) to employment, in other words,
sd (log zi ( L)) = sd (log zi (1)) + Γ log L
The case where Γ = 0 corresponds to a simple constant-incidence benchmark in the gross earnings of
all individuals are equally affected by changes in L. When Γ is negative, recessions are times when
the income distribution widens endogenously, capturing countercyclical income risk. There is some
evidence that such a widening of the income distribution tends to happen in response to contractionary
monetary policy shocks (e.g. Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Kueng and Silvia 2017), suggesting Γ < 0 as a
relevant empirical case. We pick Γ = −0.5 for illustrative purposes, and consider the consequences of

55

using alternative values in section D.6.
The right panel of figure B.2 reproduces the implied elasticities of gross earnings Lγ (s, L) under
these three benchmark parametrizations of the γ function. Equal incidence corresponds to the case
where this elasticity is a constant of one. Relative to the U-shaped pattern of GSSY, our Γ < 0 parameterization has elasticities that monotonically decline in a worker’s gross earnings percentile, so
that richer individuals’ earnings are systematically more insulated from employment fluctuations than
poorer individuals’ earnings are.

in part be due to the fact that we model the income tax as the only source of government revenue.

We start from a slight generalization of our fiscal rules
(13)–(14) that allows for responsiveness of government spending to past debt directly,

In the data, estimates of potential output Yt are more readily available than estimates of potential

where γi , κi are country fixed effects. These are typical of specifications considered in the fiscal rules literature (e.g. Galí and Perotti 2003). To map estimated coefficients back to our primitive elasticities, note
that nominal growth mechanically pushes up countries’ deficit-to-GDP ratio—an effect that we would
like to correct for in our structural estimates of government fiscal adjustment. Specifically, if countries

target a constant Yt−t 1 = b, then the deficit-GDP ratio will be t Yt t−1 = Yt+t 1 b − b = g Yt−t 1 , where g = Yt+t 1
is nominal GDP growth, suggesting an upward-bias of g in our estimate of β 2 in (71). Given average
nominal growth of g, the estimated coefficients in (70)–(71) therefore relate to our primitive elasticities
in (68)–(69) through eGL = −α1 , eGB = −α2 , eDL = − β 1 and eDB = − β 2 + g.
To run these regressions, we use data for 16 OECD countries over the period 1995 − 2015 from the
June 2017 OECD economic outlook.52 Our source variable for Dt is (the opposite of) government net
lending. For Bt we use general government gross financial liabilities, for Gt we use nominal government
pot
final consumption expenditure, for Yt we usenominal GDP, and finally for Yt we use nominal potential
output in year t.
Table B.1 presents the results. Our estimated coefficients on the output gap are negative everyhwere,
and much more negative for deficits Dit than for spending Git . This is consistent with governments
running countercyclical policy, with deficits being the main adjustment tool. Our esimated coefficients
on lagged debt are also negative, consistent with government actively stabilizing debt. The estimates
for β 1 are close to zero, however, justifying our setting eGB = 0 for our main fiscal rule specification.
Moreover, after adjustment for average nominal growth, the estimates for β 2 imply eDB ' 0.07, implying
− log 2
a half-life of deficits of around 10 years ( log(1−0.07) ' 10). Together, these estimates lead us to our choice
of eGL = 0.1, eBL = 0.75 and eDB = 0.07, as reported in table 1.

Figure B.3: Lorenz curves for consumption, income and wealth at steady-state
Alternative calibrations. When examining robustness to fiscal rules, we consider a version where
eGL = 0 and eDL is maintained at its estimated value of 0.75. This captures the effect of countercyclical
deficits alone, absent government spending. We also consider a version where eGL = eDL = 0, implying
that B = Bss and G = Gss at all times. This delivers a procyclical fiscal rule that increases the tax rate
when employment falls so as to maintain public spending and debt constant.

B.4

Steady state distributions of consumption, income and wealth

Figure B.3 displays the Lorenz curves for the steady-state distributions of consumption, pre-tax labor
income ei , post-tax labor income yi , and wealth in our model (on the left panel), and constrasts them
with their equivalent in the 2013 SCF (on the right panel).53 Our model captures these distributions
very well. The income distribution is a good fit by design, but the wealth distribution gets surprisingly
close to the data, a result that is typically challenging to obtain for simple calibration of Aiyagari models
without entrepreneurial risk or heterogeneity in preferences. This success is mostly due to our earnings
dynamics with additional income risk, but our high labor-share calibration plays a role as well, since
it effectively amplifies income risk in general equilibrium. The bottom 40% of the wealth distribution
owns exactly 1% of wealth in the model and the data, and the top 20% own exactly 84% in the model
and the data. The model does understate, however, the very top of the wealth distribution, since the top
1% own 17% of wealth in the model, but own 33% in the data.

1980 calibration

We recalibrate to our model to 1980, by following the same principles as those for our 2013 calibration.
Since the U.S. government only started selling Treasury inflation-protected securities in 1997, we instead
53 Specifically, in the 2013 SCF, we define consumption as food at home (foodhome), labor income as wage income
(wageinc), and wealth as net worth (networth). In constructing the wage income distribution, we only keep households with annual wage income above $4000, since around a quarter of households have zero or extremely low
wage income.

economy is at full employment, L = 1, and well described by a neoclassical monetary policy rule. (The
average unemployment rate was 7.2% in that year, compared to the CBO estimate of lont-term average
rate of 6.2%. In 1979, the economy was at full employment.)

τ r = 17.5% as in our baseline calibration. We assume the same household portfolios as in section B.1, the
same incidence function as in section B.2, and the same fiscal rules as in section B.3. We finally follow
our standard procedure of rescaling both the transitory and the persistent component of the income
process to achieve the standard deviation of log earnings implied by the Song et al. (2016) for 1980,
sd(log e)=0.80. Given these choices, we recalibrate the household discount factor β so that the steadystate real interest rate is equal to our target of r = 4%. Table B.2 summarizes our 1980 parameters.

Proofs
Homotheticity and its implications

We first prove a homogeneity property for the household decision problem from Definition 10.
Lemma 14. Consumption and asset policy functions ct ( a, s) and a0t ( a, s) are homogenous of degree 1 in ( a, {yt (s)}).

Suppose that a−1 and {yt (s)} are scaled by λ. If we scale all feasible plans { at } and {ct }, the budget
constraint still holds at every time t and utility is scaled by λ1−σ , which leaves relative utility of feasible
plans unaffected. Hence the optimum is the same as the original, with consumption and asset policies
scaled by λ.
This implies a homogeneity property for steady state consumption and assets from Definition 12.
PE and assets A PE are homogenous of degree 1 in { y ( s )}.
Corollary 15. Steady-state consumption Css
ss

Proof. From homogeneity of the asset policy function in lemma 14, we know that the transition probability from (s, λa) to (s0 , λa0 ) under {λy (s)} is the same as the transition probability from (s, a) to (s0 , a0 )
under {y (s)}. Hence, the steady-state cumulative distribution function Ψ (s, λa) given {y (s)} is equal
at every (s, a) to the cumulative distribution function Ψ (s, a) given {λy (s)}. The population mean of a
is therefore λ times higher, and since c( a, s) is homogenous of degree 1 in a, the population mean of c is
also λ times higher.

C.2

Steady-state analytics

In this section we work out some of the analytics of steady state equilibrium, which will be used in
appendices C.3 and C.7 through C.8.

Asset demand and supply framework. Steady-state asset market clearing can be written as
(72)

A = B+K

where A are aggregate assets owned by households and B + K is the total supply of assets.
We seek to write (72) as an equation with r and L as the only endogenous inputs. To do so, consider
e can be
the aggregate asset function (55). In the steady state limit, the initial values p−1 , B−1 , and Ψ

dropped. Further, we will represent the exogenous incomedistribution parameters {e(s), τ } with a

single shifter σ, resulting in a steady-state asset function Ass

W
g
P , L, τ , r, σ

.

As we will characterize below, steady-state real wages and taxes can be written as functions w(r )
and τ g (r, L). Using these functions, we define a consolidated steady-state asset demand function
Ad (r, L, σ) ≡ Ass (w(r ), L, τ g (r, L), r, σ)

(73)

Similarly, steady-state bonds can be written as a function B( L) from the fiscal rule, and steady-state
capital can be written as a function κ (r ) L, where the capital-labor ratio κ (r ) is only a function of r. We

60

thus define steady-state asset supply as
As (r, L) ≡ B( L) + κ (r ) L

(74)

Finally, we define normalized asset demand, which divides by aggregate after-tax labor income
âd (r, L, σ) ≡

Ad (r, L, σ)
(1 − τ g (r, L))w(r ) L

(75)

In the special case where γ = 1, all after-tax incomes y(s) are proportional to aggregate after-tax income
(1 − τ g (r, L))w(r ) L, and it follows from corollary 15 that steady-state asset demand scales with (1 −
τ g (r, L))w(r ) L, implying that L has no additional effect normalized asset demand.
Corollary 16. When γ = 1, âd (r, L, σ) is independent of L.
With these definitions in hand, steady-state equilibrium is characterized by market clearing
Ad (r, L, σ) = As (r, L)

(76)

In this section, we will further characterize Ad and As . Whether r or L adjusts to maintain equilibrium
in (76) depends on the monetary rule, as we will discuss in appendices C.3 and C.7.

Components of asset demand and supply. The components of Ad (r, L, σ) and As (r, L) as defined
defined above are B( L), G ( L), τ g (r, L), κ (r ), w(r ). We obtain these functions as follows. First, the fiscal
rules (13)-(14) imply steady-state spending and bond supply functions
G ( L) = Gss − Yss eGL ( L − Lss )
e
B( L) = Bss − Yss DL ( L − Lss )

(77)
(78)

The government budget constraint (57) at steady state is τ g W
P L = rB + G, and it follows that
τ g (r, L) =

rB( L) + G ( L)
w (r ) L

(79)

which we can substitute into (75) to obtain a simplified expression relating normalized and actual asset
demand
Ad (r, L, σ) = (w(r ) L − rB( L) − G ( L)) âd (r, L, σ)
(80)
Finally, the capital-labor ratio κ (r ) is given implicitly by equating the marginal product of capital and
user cost r + δ in steady state, and the real wage w(r ) is the marginal product of labor at this capital
intensity:

(r + δ)κ (r ) + w(r ) = F (κ (r ), 1). Differentiating both sides with respect to r, (r + δ)κ 0 (r ) and FK κ 0 (r )
cancel out and we are left with simply w0 (r ) = −κ (r ), implying a wage semielasticity of

Note the remarkable simplification in (91), where the semielasticity of asset demand breaks into two
simple terms: minus normalized asset demand, plus the semielasticity of normalized asset demand.
The former term captures the influence of r on after-tax income: at the margin, the cost of higher r is
paid entirely by workers, either through lower pretax wages (as the cost of capital in the production
function) or through higher taxes. Relative to current after-tax income, the drop in after-tax income
resulting from a rise in r is exactly the ratio of assets to after-tax income, i.e. normalized asset demand.
In (92), the elasticity η I of normalized asset demand to L is zero by corollary 16 in the case where
γ = 1, drastically simplifying the elasticity.

C.3

Equilibrium uniqueness

Our model’s state space includes the distribution of agents over assets and is thus infinite-dimensional.
We therefore cannot directly resort to standard tools such as Blanchard and Kahn (1980) to study either
a) the uniqueness of steady states, or b) the local uniqueness of rational expectations equilibrium paths
around such steady states.

Numerical verification. It is, however, straightforward to numerically verify a) for our calibration,
by calculating asset demand and supply and showing that they only intersect once in the relevant space
(either r or L).55
• For neoclassical monetary policy, L = 1 is fixed, and in the left panel of figure 9 we plot asset
demand Ad (r, 1, σ) and supply As (r, 1) with respect to r, showing a unique intersection r ∗ .
• For constant-r monetary policy with r ∗ at our calibrated value of 0, the right panel of figure 10
plots asset demand Ad (0, L, σ) and supply As (0, L) with respect to L, showing a single intersection
L. (Figure D.4 provides the same plot under alternative assumptions about γ, showing that for
sufficiently countercyclical income risk there are multiple equilibria.)
• For our benchmark monetary policy, a Taylor rule with ZLB, it is in principle possible for steadystate equilibrium to have full employment L = 1 (in which case equilibrium is the same as under
neoclassical monetary policy), or to have L < 1 and π = κ − 1 = 0, implying i = r = 0, as in
our calibrated steady state. Evaluating condition (100) later in this section, we rule out the former
case. We show quantitatively in figure 12 that uniqueness extends to different assumptions about
the wage lower bound κ and interest rate lower bound i, although the unique equilibrium is L = 1
for sufficiently low values of the latter. By contrast, for higher values of the inflation target π ∗ ,
there do exist multiple equilibria.
Verifying b), local uniqueness of equilibrium paths around the steady state, is more complex. When
there is multiplicity, the invertibility condition needed for the derivation of the GE matrix in appendix
55 All other steady-state quantities and prices are unique conditional on r

and L, as the discussion in appendix C.2
and the derivation of firm and household behavior in appendices A.1 and A.2 shows.

63

C.5 will not be satisfied. We can test for multiplicity, therefore, by checking whether there are problems
with invertibility (i.e. very small singular values) when we numerically calculate the truncated GE matrix.56 When we do this for our calibration, we find no evidence of multiplicity. (See the Computational
Appendix for more details.)

General case. In the rest of this section, we complement our numerical verification of uniqueness
by providing a more general analysis of steady-state uniqueness a) in our model. Along the way, we
contribute to the literature by providing a simple condition for uniqueness in the Aiyagari model.
For local uniqueness of paths b), a general analysis is more complex and beyond the scope of the paper. We are currently developing tools for this, which infer uniqueness directly from partial equilibrium
impulse responses, in Auclert et al. (2017).

General case: neoclassical monetary policy. A sufficient condition for a unique neoclassical equilibrium is that the semielasticity (91) of asset demand with respect to r is strictly greater than the
semielasticity (93) of asset supply, so that there is only a single intersection of asset demand and asset supply.
∂ log âd (r,L,σ)

The second term in (91) is

entirely on the household’s partial equilibrium decision problem, and it is positive if, holding the longterm after-tax income level fixed, higher real interest rates lead households to demand a higher aggregate quantity of assets in steady state. In an important contribution, Achdou, Han, Lasry, Lions and
Moll (2017) prove that it is positive,

ν < 1, as in the benchmark calibration ν = 1/2 in this paper, it is possible in principle for income
effects to dominate and cause â to slope downward in r. In practice, however, this seems to be true
only in extreme cases, and we have found only upward-sloping â for all variants of the household-side
calibrations in this paper.
Conditioning on (95), we have the following proposition.
Proposition 17. There is a unique real steady-state equilibrium under neoclassical monetary policy within the
region where households’ normalized asset demand âd (r, 1, σ) is upward-sloping in r and the inequality

Proof. Real equilibrium is uniquely determined by r, and the semielasticity (91) of asset demand is
strictly greater than the semielasticity (93) of asset supply—implying a unique intersection r—whenever
the term
A
(1−τ g )αY

∂ log â(r,L,σ)

is strictly positive and â(r, 1, σ) ≤

and multiplying both sides by α, we have (96).

56 An alternative approach to numerically verifying uniqueness is to set up the problem recursively using a discretized state space, as in Reiter (2009), and then apply some version of Blanchard and Kahn (1980). We take this approach because it demonstrates uniqueness as a side consequence of a calculation—obtaining the GE matrix—that
we are already performing.

Corollary 18. Consider an Aiyagari economy where B = G = 0. Then there is a unique real steady-state
equilibrium under neoclassical monetary policy within the region where households’ normalized asset demand
âd (r, 1, σ) is upward-sloping in r and the inequality
ε ≥ 1−α

(97)

is satisfied—i.e. the elasticity of substitution in the production function is greater than the capital share.
Proof. In this case, K/A = 1, τ g = 0, and (r + δ)K/Y = 1 − α, so (96) reduces to (97).
The dramatic simplification in the case without steady-state government debt and spending in corollary 18 may be useful for the literature going forward.
The simpler result also admits a more direct derivation. In the absence of taxes or government debt,
normalized asset supply is just the capital-wage ratio κ (r )/w(r ). This ratio is increasing in r iff the
elasticity of wages w = FL with respect to the capital-labor ratio is less than 1. This elasticity is
F FF K
FLK K
= LK K = ε−1 (1 − α)
FL
FL FK F
and it is less than 1 when (97) holds.
It is also clear that (97) is nearly always satisfied: the vast majority of calibrations put the elasticity
of substitution in the production function above the capital share. Indeed, (97) is trivially satisfied
under Cobb-Douglas, in which case corollary 18 establishes global uniqueness as long as â is everywhere
upward-sloping.
The more general condition (96) does not hold quite as universally: for instance, in the limit where
government debt is the only asset, K/A on the left is zero, and the condition cannot hold. In our benchmark calibration, the left side of (96) is .85 × 0+10.04 ≈ 21.3, while the right is 3.76
0.79 = 4.8, and we are well
within the region where the condition holds; in a modified calibration with more government spending
and debt, this would be less clear.

General case: constant-r monetary policy. A sufficient condition for unique equilibrium under
constant-r monetary policy is that the elasticity (92) of asset demand exceeds the elasticity (94) of asset
supply with respect to L. The next proposition immediately follows.
Proposition 19. There is a unique equilibrium under constant-r monetary policy within the region where the

Corollary 20. Equilibrium under constant-r monetary policy is globally unique if eDL , eGL > 0, r ≥ 0, and
γ = 1.
Proof. If γ = 1, then

∂ log â(r,L,σ)
∂ log L

= 0, and inequality (98) follows from

K

The condition in proposition 98 is somewhat complex, but assuming that fiscal policy is countercyclical (eDL , eGL ≥ 0) and that r ≥ 0, the first two terms on the left of (98) are unambiguously positive.57
57 We

always require eDB > 0 for stability reasons.

65

∂ log â(r,L,σ)

The only danger is that
is very negative; this can happen if income incidence γ is such that
∂ log L
income risk is highly countercyclical, which makes precautionary savings increase strongly as L falls.
Appendix D.6 exhibits cases where this does indeed happen, as highly countercyclical income risk leads
to multiplicity. If the income distribution is acyclical, i.e. γ = 1, then this effect is shut off and we are
guaranteed global uniqueness by corollary 20.
The following proposition is a partial inverse of proposition 19, showing that there is multiplicity if
(98) does not hold at any equilibrium.
Proposition 21. If eDL , eGL ≥ 0 and r ≥ 0, a necessary condition for unique steady-state equilibrium is that
(98) holds (weakly) at any equilibrium.
Proof. Assuming countercyclical fiscal policy, steady-state taxation G + rB increases as L falls, implying
that after-tax income wL − ( G + rB) hits 0 at some L > 0, and therefore asset demand hits 0 as well.
Meanwhile, with countercyclical fiscal policy, asset supply is bounded from below by Bss as L falls.
Therefore, for sufficiently low L, the asset demand curve is below the asset supply curve. If, however,
the left side of (98) is negative at an equilibrium, then for L immediately below the equilibrium, asset
demand is above asset supply. This implies another intersection at some lower L.
Proposition 21 provides a simple condition to test for multiplicity: evaluate (98) at the calibrated
steady state. If it fails, then multiplicity is certain. Although the inverse is not necessarily true, the
quantitative examples in appendix D.6 suggest that it is true in practice: in every case where we find
multiplicity, the slope of asset demand is below asset supply at the calibrated steady state, i.e. (98) fails.

General case: benchmark monetary policy. Finally, we study equilibria under the benchmark
monetary policy given by (18), a Taylor rule subject to a lower bound i.
The complementary slackness condition (62) gives two possibilities: either we are in the neoclassical
equilibrium with L = 1, or the nominal wage growth constraint is binding with Wt = κWt−1 .
The real interest rate achieved in steady state, dividing (18) by 1 + π, is
1 + r = max

1+π



(99)

This reaches a global minimum at the point where the two arguments of (99) are equal, i.e. where the


lower bound i is exactly binding, which is 1 + π = 11++ri∗
(1 + π ∗ ) φ and results in a minimum of

growth constraint is such that the ZLB is never binding, and the achievable minimum real interest rate
 φ −1
is 1 + r = (1 + r ∗ ) 1+κπ ∗
.
∗
Now, let r̃ denote the natural rate.58 There will be a neoclassical equilibrium iff this natural rate is
higher than the minimum of r, since then there will exist some π ≥ κ − 1 such that the real interest rate
from (99) equals the natural rate. We summarize this reasoning in the following proposition.
58 We

let

r̃ ∗

use r ∗ to denote the natural rate in the benchmark, and this is what appears in the Taylor rule (18), but we
more generally denote the natural rate following a shock.

66

r ∗ ≥ (1 + r ∗ ) φ − 1, which is impossible since r ∗ < 0 . This allows us to rule out a L = 1 equilibrium.59
The alternative possibility is an equilibrium with L < 1, where Wt = κWt−1 . In this case, π = κ − 1,
and the real interest rate achieved in equilibrium is above the natural rate r̃ ∗ . Using (99), this gives the
following proposition.
Proposition 23. Under the benchmark monetary policy given by (18), there exists a steady state equilibrium with

Combining propositions 22 and 23 fully characterizes equilibria under the benchmark monetary
policy. Uniqueness of equilibrium for proposition 22 is given by our earlier results on uniqueness of
neoclassical equilibrium, and uniqueness of equilibrium for proposition 23 is given by our results on
uniqueness of constant-r equilibrium, substituting the right side of (101) as the r target.

Proof of proposition 3

Consider a one-time redistributive labor income shock. From lemma 13, this affects the path of consumption according to

We rewrite (102) using individual level responses. Define household i’s marginal propensity to consume at
time t out of date-0 income to be
∂(E0 [cit ])
MPCit ≡
∂yi0
i.e. the change in i’s expected spending at time t conditional on household i’s date-0 state, as we vary his
date-0 after-tax income.
59 The

right panel of figure 12 shows a neoclassical equilibrium does exist for sufficiently higher inflation targets.

67

Since (51) can be rewritten as Ct = E I [cit ], we have
∂Ct

= ∂(E I [cit ]) = ∂(E I [E0 [cit ]])

∂(E0 [cit ])
dyi0

(104)

where the second equality follows from the law of iterated expectations and the third equality follows
from interchanging the expectations and differential operators. The final step follows from (103) and (6):
since his is a redistributionary shock, E I [dyi0 ] = 0.
To prove that NPV (∂C) = 0, note that for any realized sequence of shocks, combining the household

as desired.

Proof of theorem 4

Case 1: ZLB and constant-r monetary policy. Let
g

xt ≡ (Kt , qt , rt , Lt , Wt , Pt , Yt , pt , dt , τt , Bt , Gt , πt , it , At )
and let x = [xt ] ∈ `∞ be the stacked vector with each of these 15 endogenous series. Also let ϕt ≡
({et (s)}, τtr ), and let ϕ = [ ϕt ] ∈ `∞ be the corresponding stacked vector of exogenous series.
For each t, define Ht (x, ϕ) to consist of 15 stacked equations: all 11 equations in appendix A.3 under
“firms and production”, “fiscal policy”, and “inflation and the Fisher equation”, plus the relevant monetary policy equation (either ZLB or constant-r), the binding nominal wage rigidity equation Wt = κWt−1 ,
the asset demand equation (64), and the asset market clearing condition (66). Let H(x, ϕ) = [Ht (x, ϕ)]
be the stacked set of equations for all t.
In the neighborhood of the steady state, general equilibrium is characterized60 by
Ht (x, ϕ) = 0.
Applying the implicit function theorem for Banach spaces, (for example Teschl 2018), assuming that
Hx (xss , ϕss ) is invertible,61 locally around (xss , ϕss ) there exists a function x( ϕ) mapping exogenous ϕ to
endogenous outcomes x. This function satisfies
1
dx = H−
x ( xss , ϕss ) H ϕ ( xss , ϕss ) dϕ

(106)

Let I A be the mapping that embeds A in the space of x. Since the components of ϕ, {et (s)} and τtr , only
enter into the asset demand equation (63), it follows from lemma 13 that
H ϕ (xss , ϕss )dϕ = I A ∂A
where ∂A is the vector of partial equilibrium asset responses. This links to the consumption responses
∂C characterized in the same lemma via the relation ∂C = −∆∂A, where the operator ∆ takes quasi-first
differences: (∆∂A)t = ∂At − (1 + r )∂At−1 .
60 In the calibrated steady state with ZLB or constant-r monetary policy, the economy is at L < 1. In the neighborhood of this, the nominal wage rigidity equation Wt = κWt−1 is strictly binding and labor market clearing is not
binding.
61 In computing the GE matrix, we numerically verify this invertibility for a truncated version of H . See the
x
online Computational Appendix for more details.

where GY is the desired GE matrix. The ∆−1 operator maps bounded ∂C with net present value zero into
bounded perturbations ∂A to assets. Using the same argument as that in the proof of proposition 3, all
transitory redistributive labor income shocks produce partial equilibrium ∂C that satisfy NPV (∂C) = 0.
In particular, GY ∂C is defined for all the shocks we consider.
Note, crucially, that GY is independent of the shock ϕ. We can analogously obtain a G matrix for any
g
of the aggregates (Kt , qt , rt , Lt , Wt , Pt , Yt , pt , dt , τt , Bt , Gt , πt , it , At ) in x.

Case 2: neoclassical monetary policy. This is similar, but there is now potentially nominal indeterminacy, so we will work with only real values. Let now
g

xt ≡ (Kt , qt , rt , Lt , Wt /Pt , Yt , pt , dt , τt , Bt , Gt , At )
and define Ht (x, ϕ) to consist of 12 stacked equations: all 9 equations in appendix A.3 under “firms and
production” and “fiscal policy”, the monetary policy equation Lt = 1, asset demand equation (64), and
the asset market clearing condition (66). The rest of the proof now proceeds as in case 1.

C.6

Proof of proposition 5

If τ r = 0, agents’ after-tax incomes are proportional to their endowments, which in turn are proportional
in all periods to eωi , where ωi are the fixed effects. It follows from the homogeneity result in corollary
15 that the average steady-state assets and consumption for agents with a particular fixed effect ωi are
proportional to eωi .
e i relative to the baseline ωi must leave the
Redistributive changes in the distribution of fixed effects ω
average endowment unchanged, implying that E I [eωe i − eωi ] = 0. But since average steady-state assets
and consumption are proportional to eωi , it follows that these are also unchanged, as desired.

Proofs of proposition 6, corollary 7 and proposition 8

Proposition 6 follows from (76), substituting in the special case assumptions B( L) = B and G ( L) = G
and using homotheticity to write â(r, L, σ) = â(r, σ).
For corollary 7 and proposition 8, start from equation (76) equating asset demand and supply

This makes fiscal policy neutral with respect to changes in technology that affect Y directly.
Let α now denote the labor share that is obtained in steady state equilibrium. (It was previously
equal to the parameter of the Cobb-Douglas production function, but not in the enriched model.)
We can split the non-labor share into income accruing to capital and monopolistic profits from
markups:

where we summarize the steady-state fiscal rules for debt and government spending by the expressions

follows that we can write asset supply normalized by after-tax labor income as

where we make the dependence of the labor share α on all inputs except L explicit.62
Asset market clearing can then be written as the equality of normalized asset supply and demand
âd (r, L) = âs (r, L; F, X, µ)

(113)

and, analogously to appendix C.7, we can get the equilibriating change following a shock by totally
differentiating and solving given the appropriate monetary rule. For neoclassical policy, the adjustment

2.2, we are assuming uniqueness throughout this paper, and therefore we assume that both these expressions are positive for comparative statics.63 Given this, any shock resulting in a positive d log âs,partial
will result in positive dr and dL/L in the neoclassical and constant-r/benchmark cases, respectively.
62 The labor share is unaffected by

L, which simply scales output and incomes conditional on r and the production
parameters F, X, and µ.
63 This is just another instance of the ubiquitous point that a condition needed for equilibrium uniqueness or
stability is also needed to characterize comparative statics.

Note that the sign on dαpartial in (116) is negative. Therefore, if there is a shock to either the production function F or investment prices X that results in a decline dαpartial < 0 in the labor share while
leaving markups unchanged, we have d log âs,partial > 0, as desired.
The coefficient on dµ−1 in (116) is negative, since 1/(r + δ) < 1/r. A rise in markups dµ > 0, which
implies dµ−1 < 0, therefore contributes positively to (116). If the rise in markups causes a decline in
the labor share, therefore, combined with our previous result, we have d log âs,partial > 0 as well. This
completes the proof.64

Labor supply in heterogeneous agent models

Most of the heterogeneous agent models with nominal rigidities in the literature remain as close as
possible to the canonical representative agent model by assuming sticky prices, flexible wages, and separable preferences (e.g., McKay et al. 2016, Kaplan et al. 2016, Athreya et al. 2017). Using the simplified
asset notation of section A.2, under this alternative assumption, households solve

in the labor share, because the direct negative effect is outweighed by the substitution away from capital. If this
rise in the labor share is large enough, then the effect of dαpartial > 0 can dominate and lead to the opposite macro
effects. Conditional on a rise in markups resulting in a decline in the labor share (the case commonly understood to
be true, and considered in proposition 9), however, the result is unambiguous.

Equation (120) implies a relationship between marginal propensities to earn MPEit and marginal propensity to consume MPCit that is at odds with the data in two dimensions.
First, the implied levels of marginal propensities to earn are much too high relative to the data. Many studies,
such as Chetty, Guren, Manoli and Weber (2011), find that the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is close to
or above our calibration of 0.5 for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (ψ ' ν = 0.5); while budget
constraints imply that post-tax income must account for an important part of consumption

E I [ MPCit ]. Most studies of the marginal propensity to earn, however, find extremely low levels of
E I [ MPEit ]. Using a sample of Swedish lottery winners matched to administrative data on earnings,
Cesarini et al. (2017), a paper representative of the studies in the literature, find an average MPE of
−0.01. This is inconsistent with studies of marginal propensities to consume, that find numbers in the
range of 0.25. Even in our model, in which the average marginal propensity to consume is 0.175, the
average marginal propensity to consume implied by (120) remains an order of magnitude too large
relative to these studies.
Second, the implied heterogeneity in marginal propensities to earn is at odds with the data. Equation (120)
implies that marginal propensities to consume and work should be inversely related in the cross-section:
high MPC should come together with high negative MPE, except for individuals with no labor earnings.
There is no evidence in the data to support this hypothesis. Cesarini et al. (2017) find no significant
evidence of heterogeneity in MPE by income. The limited heterogeneity suggested by the data goes in
the other direction as that implied by equation (120): the highest tercile of earners respond slightly more
to lottery wins, with an MPE of −0.01 relative to an MPE of −0.005 for the bottom two terciles (see their
figure 3, panel F).
An alternative to this preference specification that avoids
these implications for wealth effects on labor supply is to shut them down entirely by assuming GHH
preferences (eg, Bayer et al. 2017). In Auclert and Rognlie (2017b), we explain why the feedbacks from
consumption-labor complementarities implied by this specification are problematic. In a representative
∂y
agent model, we show that they imply that the fiscal multiplier ∂gtt is equal to to the inverse of the steady
state labor wedge, which in our model is equal to the marginal tax rate τ. Hence, in our model, such preferences would put the fiscal multiplier above 3, well outside of the range of empirical estimates. More
generally, in Auclert and Rognlie (2017b) we make the case that there is no specification of within period
utility U (cit , nit ) that maintains flexible wages and can both rationalize the microeconomic evidence on
marginal propensities to earn and the macroeconomic evidence on fiscal multipliers. We conclude that

our specification in the main text, which assumes wage rigidities and removes the short-run choice of
labor (118), is a better match to micro evidence than any of these leading alternatives from the literature.

D.2

Goods vs asset market clearing

While our short-run analysis focuses on flows and discussion of goods market equilibrium, our longrun analysis is based on asset market equilibrium instead. Could we conduct the long-run analysis in
the goods market instead? The answer is no.
For a simple example of why, consider the special case in section C.7. Start with the long-run goods
market clearing equation
C + I + G = F (K, L)
(121)
In steady state, I = δK = δκ (r ) L and F (K, L) = w(r ) L + (r + δ)K = w(r ) L + (r + δ)κ (r ) L. Further,
in our model, steady-state consumption C equals the steady state flow of after-tax income accruing to
households. Therefore, C = (1 − τ )w(r ) L(1 + r âd (r, σ)), where after-tax labor earnings are (1 − τ )w(r ) L
and the flow of income on assets is r â(r, σ) times this. Since τw(r ) L = G + rB by the government budget

constraint, this can be written as C = w(r ) L − ( G + rB) (1 + r â(r, σ)).
Substituting these into steady-state goods market clearing (121) gives

w(r ) L − ( G + rB) (1 + r â(r, σ)) + δκ (r ) L + G = w(r ) L + (r + δ)κ (r ) L

We immediately see that a w(r ) L and δκ (r ) L are on both the left and right and cancel, and G and − G

Notably, this goods market clearing condition is exactly r times the asset market clearing condition
(27) derived in appendix C.7. Equation (27) implies (123), but not the other way around. Instead, in
our benchmark calibration with r = 0, (123) reduces to the degenerate 0 = 0 and holds regardless of
whether the L is consistent with asset market clearing.
Effectively, Walras’ law breaks down in the steady state, and goods market clearing can be insufficient for equilibrium. We conclude that long-run macroeconomic adjustment is best understood in
terms of stocks, not flows.

D.3

Monetary policy implementation

We have assumed that monetary policy sets the nominal interest rate it , which is connected to the real
interest rate rt along perfect-foresight paths by the Fisher equation (17):
1 + rt =

1 + it
1 + π t +1

To clarify how this is possible, let us augment the set of assets that the household trades, introducing a
nominal bond bitn and money mit (where money is the numeraire, a nominal asset with no other special
properties).

To complete our description of this augmented economy, suppose that asset market clearing holds

Household optimization implies that along a perfect foresight path, the returns on real bonds, nominal
bonds, and money must be equalized. Equal return for real and nominal bonds is the Fisher equation
(17), while equal return for nominal bonds and money is
it = itm
Hence, we can think about monetary policy working as follows. Monetary policy sets the interest rate
paid on money itm , which through household optimization is equated with the nominal interest rate it
on bonds and then sets the real interest rate rt via the Fisher equation.65
In our model, we assume that nominal bonds and money are in zero net supply, and we calibrate
initial individual household positions such that each household has bi,n−1 = mi,n−1 = 0. Since there is no
distinction between these assets along perfect foresight paths, btn and mnt can also be rolled for t ≥ 0 into
the consolidated household asset position at as discussed in appendix A.2. These assumptions mean
that nominal bonds and money, aside from facilitating monetary policy, play no role in the model. They
are therefore omitted in the description (2) of the household budget constraint in the main text.66
For each monetary regime we consider, monetary policy sets it via itm . This is straightforward for our
benchmark Taylor rule with a zero lower bound, which directly specifies the choice of it . For neoclassical
65 This

is distinct from the traditional view of monetary policy, where there is a convenience yield on money due
to its value in overcoming transactional frictions, and where monetary policy controls the nominal interest rate by
changing the supply of money and therefore its marginal convenience yield.
This traditional view is no longer an accurate depiction of monetary policy in many large economies, including
the US, where post-2008 there has been an abundance of excess reserves and the prevailing short-term nominal
interest rate has been roughly equal to the interest rate on excess reserves. Interpreting itm as the interest rate on
excess reserves, therefore, we believe this model more accurately depicts the mechanics of monetary policy in its
current form.
66 It is worth noting that even if we did not assume zero net supply and zero initial household positions
n
bi,−1 = mi,n−1 = 0, the perfect foresight assumption means that neither nominal bonds or money make any difference to either the household or government budget constraints, except at date 0 following an unanticipated shock.
Our treatment of nominal bonds and money can therefore be viewed as a simplifying assumption for the date-0
calibration of asset positions, one that is relatively innocuous given the limited inflation response to our shocks. See
Auclert (2017) for more discussion of how different initial asset positions lead to redistributive effects from changes
in the price level and nominal interest rate.

policy, the central bank sets it such that the rt implied by expected inflation is consistent with Lt = 1
at all t. For constant-r policy, the central bank attempts to set it such that the rt implied by expected
inflation is constant at rt = r ∗ . This is not always feasible, since sometimes maintaining this target for rt
would require Lt > 1; it is feasible as long as constant r is consistent with Lt ≤ 1 in equilibrium, which
is the case in all of the experiments in this paper.

D.4

Taylor rules

Here we examine the robustness of our results to an alternative monetary regime with active Taylor
rules. We begin with our benchmark Taylor rule (18) with a zero lower bound i = 0:
∗

∗

it = max i, (1 + r )(1 + π )



Pt /Pt−1
1 + π∗

φ

!

−1

(18)

In the paper thus far, φ has turned out to be irrelevant, since the lower bound is always binding in our
experiments.
In this extension we start by supposing that the monetary authority follows the same monetary rule
but that it is not constrained by any lower bound (i.e. i = −∞). We then additionally consider a slightly
broader family of standard Taylor rules, which respond to both inflation and unemployment—where
we use Lt /Lss as our measure of the deviation of unemployment from steady state:
∗

∗

it = (1 + r )(1 + π )



Pt /Pt−1
1 + π∗

φπ 

Lt
Lss

 φL

−1

(126)

To see how these changes in the monetary regime affect the equilibrium response to temporary and
permanent inequality shocks in our model, we recompute the general equilibrium impulse responses
in figures 4 and 11. We continue to display the impulse responses under the ZLB monetary regime
(18) as a benchmark, but now we additionally display impulse responses under a Taylor rule (126) with
coefficients (φπ = 1.5, φL = 0) and (φπ = 1.5, φL = 0.5). The first specification captures a Taylor rule
that responds only to inflation, with a standard slope of 1.5, and the second specification captures a
Taylor rule that additionally responds to unemployment.
It is important to note that when we recalibrate the model to these alternative monetary regimes, we
continue to assume the same steady-state calibration targets, including i∗ = 0 and π ∗ = 0. This parallels
our earlier treatment of different monetary regimes (e.g. neoclassical vs. ZLB), and it facilitates easier
interpretation by ensuring that we only see differences in the impulse response to inequality shocks, not
in the steady states prior to those shocks.

Inequality in the short run. Figure D.1 displays the results from recomputing the GE impulse responses in figure 4 under our new Taylor rule specifications.
The Taylor rule that only responds to inflation, with φπ = 1.5, delivers results nearly identical
to our benchmark ZLB specification. The differences are minor and vary over the impulse response:
with φπ = 1.5, the initial drop in output is slightly smaller, but the persistent decline in output is
slightly larger. The impact here is small because our model features relatively little variability in inflation
when the downward nominal wage rigidity constraint is binding. Locally, changes in price inflation
come entirely from changes in the marginal product of labor as the capital/labor ratio varies due to the
business cycle, rather than from wage inflation.

Figure D.1: General equilibrium for temporary shock with Taylor rules
When we add φL = 0.5 to the Taylor rule, the output response to the inequality shock shrinks to
roughly half its previous magnitude. Qualitatively, most of the impulse responses look similar, with the
key difference being that there is now a positive net investment response to the contraction: the decline
in real interest rates from the Taylor rule overwhelms the declining marginal product of capital in (22).

Inequality in the long run. Figure D.2 displays the results from recomputing the GE impulse responses in figure 11 under our new Taylor rule specifications.
Again, the Taylor rule that only responds to inflation, with φπ = 1.5, delivers results that are nearly
identical to our benchmark along the transition path. Furthermore, both monetary regimes converge
to exactly the same steady state. The reason is that long-term inflation is locally pinned down by the
downward nominal wage rigidity constraint, and without any change in long-term inflation there can
be no difference between the long-term Taylor rule and ZLB responses.
By contrast, the Taylor rule that adds φL = 0.5 features an increase in steady-state gross output,
thanks to long-term capital accumulation driven by lower interest rates. Employment still declines, but
only by about one-tenth the ZLB benchmark response. Net output also declines, with an decrease in

Figure D.2: General equilibrium for permanent shock with Taylor rules
steady-state consumption offsetting a small increase in steady-state government spending.67
In short, with this Taylor rule response, the economy settles into a muted long-term malaise. The
effect of interest rate flexibility in this long run case is larger than in the short run, because permanent
changes in interest rates lead to substantial, permanent changes in labor and capital.

Summary discussion of Taylor rule results. Broadly, the lesson here is consistent with our earlier
discussion of the impact of inequality shocks: they are only recessionary when interest rates do not
move with sufficient speed and magnitude to offset their aggregate demand impact. More responsive
Taylor rules bring the economy closer to the neoclassical case, where the employment effect is zero and
the gross output effect is positive. In our calibration, however, the sensitivity of inflation to slack is too
weak for Taylor rules responding only to inflation to make much difference; we therefore only see this
effect with a Taylor rule that responds directly to employment. (In a alternative calibration with more
67 Since we start by calibrating to r = 0, the capital-labor ratio in the initial steady state is at its golden rule
level, and locally any change in the capital-labor ratio will have zero effect on steady-state combined private and
government consumption (which in this model, without growth, equal net output). The state-state employment
and net output effects here are therefore equal in percentage terms.

Figure D.3: Permanent shock under alternative initial portfolio allocations
responsive wage inflation, both components in the Taylor rule would most likely matter.)
In sum, although we prefer the ZLB case as a benchmark because we view it as the most transparent
and realistic case of interest rate insensitivity, any monetary regime with an insufficiently responsive
interest rate will deliver similar results.

D.5

The role of asset revaluations

Here we show that our results are nearly invariant to asset revaluation effects–that is, to the the particular θ (·) function we use. As described in section B.1, we consider θ u , θ b and θ eq as three possible
distributions of household portfolios. Figure D.3 considers the impact of our permanent shock under
ZLB monetary policy, depending on the initial assumption about θ. While it is clear that in the steady
state, reallocation should no longer matter, this figure makes clear that quantitatively, even for the initial
periods of the transition path these differential revaluation effects are very small. The only apparent
effect is that broader distributions of assets imply a slighly more contractionary effect of rising inequality since the wealth effect from falling asset prices is felt more broadly in the population—by contrast,
under our narrow definition of equity holdings, the lower-MPC, higher-asset agents tend to bear the
cost of the falling asset prices alone, mitigating the downturn.

Figure D.4: Possibility of multiple equilibria with countercyclical income risk
While there is a very small difference across impulse responses with different initial asset distributions in this example, the case of a transitory shock at the ZLB has all responses even more closely
aligned. The reason is that in that case investment barely moves on impact, so that q0 ' 1. As a result
the revaluation effects are extremely muted.

D.6

Multiple equilibria

Figure D.4 shows that our specification with countercyclical risk built into the income incidence function, i.e. (67) with Γ < 0, can potentially generate multiple equilibria. As employment L falls, income
risk increases, pushing up asset demand relative to our benchmark. This makes the asset demand curve
in figure D.4 steeper in A-L space, or even backward-bending around our calibrated steady state for
sufficiently negative Γ. And when asset demand is steeper than asset supply at our steady state, there
are multiple equilibria globally: this follows from the necessary condition for uniqueness in proposition
21 (which also turns out to be sufficient throughout the cases in figure D.4).
In addition to adding countercyclical risk, figure D.4 modifies our benchmark calibration by assuming that fiscal policy keeps debt and spending constant. This contributes to multiplicity by decreasing the slope of the asset supply curve. Indeed, in our benchmark calibration, countercyclical fiscal
policy makes asset supply slope downward (see figure 10), which would rule out multiplicity except
for extremely negative Γ < 0. Essentially, by providing assets in slumps where increased income risk
places those assets in heavy demand, countercyclical fiscal policy dampens feedback and pushes toward
uniqueness.
The steady-state multiplicity under countercyclical risk in figure D.4 is closely related to similar
steady-state multiplicity in Kreamer (2016) and Heathcote and Perri (2018).
