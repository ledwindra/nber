ABSTRACT
We construct and estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that features demandand supply-side uncertainty. Using term structure and macroeconomic data, we find sizable
effects of uncertainty on risk premia and business cycle fluctuations. Both demand-side and
supply-side uncertainty imply large contractions in real activity and an increase in term premia,
but supply-side uncertainty has larger effects on inflation and investment. We introduce a novel
analytical decomposition to illustrate how multiple distinct risk propagation channels account for
these differences. Supply and demand uncertainty are strongly correlated in the beginning of our
sample, but decouple in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

Introduction

It is well-established that broad measures of macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty vary significantly over time.1 There is also an emerging literature interested in studying how these changes in uncertainty
affect business cycle fluctuations in micro-founded general equilibrium models. With a few exceptions, this
literature tends to find that uncertainty is not among the main sources of macroeconomic fluctuations.
However, these papers typically only use macroeconomic data to pin down the effects of uncertainty, consider only one source of uncertainty, and rely on calibration exercises in which the process for uncertainty
is separately estimated.2 In this paper, we use both macroeconomic and term structure data, distinguish
between demand-side and supply-side uncertainty, and conduct a structural estimation of a micro-founded
model in which the process for uncertainty and its effects are jointly estimated. Our results demonstrate
that uncertainty matters. In particular, we uncover sizable effects of uncertainty shocks on business cycle
and term premia dynamics. The specific effects of demand-side and supply-side uncertainty are examined
through multiple endogenous risk propagation channels.
Asset prices contain valuable information about uncertainty, given that changes in macroeconomic uncertainty generate fluctuations in risk premia. We find that changes in nominal term premia contain key
identifying information disciplining the effects of uncertainty and its propagation through various risk channels. At the same time, there is empirical and anecdotal evidence suggesting that changes in measures of
uncertainty are related to heterogeneous sources (e.g., Bloom (2014)) and are also imperfectly correlated.
Figure 1 plots various uncertainty measures whose pairwise correlations range between -0.30 to 0.85. We
find it important to distinguish between different sources of uncertainty, and we explicitly model fluctuating
demand and supply uncertainty. We identify demand uncertainty as originating from shocks to the time
discount factor while supply uncertainty as emanating from shocks to TFP growth. In particular, we show
that these two types of uncertainty act through distinct channels. Finally, jointly estimating the process
for uncertainty and its effects on the economy has the important implication that uncertainty is not only
identified via changes in stochastic volatility, but also through its first-order effects on the economy.
Our quantitative analysis is based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model along the
lines of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), but with the following departures. First, we assume that
the representative household has Epstein and Zin (1989) recursive preferences to capture sensitivity towards
low-frequency consumption growth and discount rate risks. Second, we allow for stochastic volatility changes

in TFP and preference shocks, both modeled as distinct Markov chains, estimated jointly within our DSGE
model. Changes in stochastic volatility and the endogenous response of the economy to these changes
both contribute to fluctuations in uncertainty. Third, we use an iterative solution method to endogenously
capture sizable and time-varying risk premia. By modelling stochastic volatility as regime changes, we obtain
a conditionally log-linear solution that facilitates an estimation using a modification of the standard Kalman
filter. Lastly, we use data on nominal bond yields across different maturities in our estimation.
Our solution method captures the first- and second-order effects of uncertainty on agents’ decision policies, as well as effects on conditional risk premia. We show that this feature of our solution method sharpens
the identification of uncertainty dynamics. In addition, our solution method provides an approximate analytical risk decomposition that uncovers distinct risk propagation channels for which uncertainty affects
macroeconomic fluctuations. We use the risk decomposition to illustrate how uncertainty shocks produce
different effects depending on the origin (e.g., demand or supply). Our analysis therefore provides an economic interpretation for why there is not a consensus on the macroeconomic effects of uncertainty shocks.
More broadly, our risk decomposition can be utilized in a wide range of dynamic stochastic models, and is
therefore of independent interest.
Figure 2 illustrates the strong relation between real activity, measured as detrended GDP, the slope of the
nominal yield curve, and macroeconomic volatility.3 As the economy enters a recession, the slope of the yield
curve and macroeconomic volatility both tend to rise. In our model, movements from low to high volatility
regimes endogenously trigger a decline in real activity and a steepening of the yield curve, consistent with
the data. We find that the effects of uncertainty are quantitatively significant. The two uncertainty shocks
together explain over 14% of the variation in investment growth, around 10% for consumption growth, and
28% for the slope of the nominal yield curve. These shocks also produce significant countercyclical variation
in the nominal term premium. The effects of uncertainty are even more sizable when focusing on fluctuations
at business cycle frequencies. An economy that is exclusively affected by uncertainty shocks would generate
business cycle fluctuations for consumption and investment as large as 24.5% and 31%, respectively, of an
analogue economy with both uncertainty and traditional level shocks.
Both demand-side and supply-side uncertainty generate positive commovement between consumption and
investment, which is often a challenge for standard macroeconomic models. Thus, uncertainty shocks emerge
as an important source of business cycle fluctuations. However, the origin of uncertainty plays an important
role, as the two types of uncertainty impact the economy in very distinct ways. Compared to demand3
Detrended GDP is obtained by applying a bandpass filter. Similar results hold if GDP is detrended using an HP
filter. The slope of the term structure is computed as the difference between the five-year yields and the one-year
yield. Macroeconomic volatility is measured as a five-year moving average of the standard deviation of GDP growth.

side uncertainty, supply-side uncertainty has larger effects on inflation and is relatively more important
for explaining fluctuations in investment. Furthermore, while in the first half of our sample, demand- and
supply-side uncertainty tend to move together, they decouple in the second half of the sample.
Nominal term premia in our model is driven by time-varying demand and supply uncertainty. As such,
using the term structure of interest rates as observables in our estimation is important for disciplining the
effects of uncertainty. While both supply and demand uncertainty are important for the unconditional nominal term premia, we find that the conditional dynamics of nominal term premia are mostly attributed to
variation in demand-side uncertainty through the inflation risk premia component. Therefore, the observed
term structure dynamics help to sharpen the identification of the two different sources of uncertainty. Without using term structure data in our estimation, the timing of the uncertainty shocks is quite different, the
volatility regimes are less persistent, and the effects of the uncertainty shocks on the macroeconomy are
smaller.
To understand how uncertainty shocks affect the real economy and account for these differences, we use
an approximate model solution method that allows us to identify and quantify five distinct risk propagation
channels for uncertainty shocks that are labeled as precautionary savings, investment risk premium, inflation
risk premium, nominal pricing bias, and investment adjustment channel. The precautionary savings term
reflects the prudence of the representative household towards uncertainty about future income. This prudence
term arises through the households’ consumption-savings Euler equation. The investment risk premium term
emerges through the investment Euler equation, which depends on the covariance between the pricing kernel
and the return on investment. The inflation risk premium term shows up through the Fisherian equation,
and the nominal term premium imposes strong restrictions on this channel. The nominal pricing bias
arises in the Phillips curve due to the presence of nominal rigidities that makes firms more prudent when
setting nominal goods prices. Finally, the investment adjustment channel arises because of rigidities in the
household’s ability to immediately adjust investment to the desired level.
Our decomposition of the risk propagation channels show that different forces contribute to generating
empirically realistic macroeconomic and asset pricing dynamics. The precautionary savings, investment risk
premium, and the nominal pricing bias terms are the most quantitatively important risk propagation channels
for business cycles. The parameters governing price stickiness, capital adjustment costs, and elasticity of
labor supply are critical for determining the effects from these risk propagation channels. Price stickiness
and labor supply elasticity are important for determining the sign and magnitude of the precautionary
savings channel, while capital adjustment costs are important for determining the sign and magnitude of the
investment risk premium channel. The degree of price stickiness and labor supply elasticity determines the

3

sensitivity of labor demand shifts to uncertainty changes. The degree of capital adjustment costs affects the
covariance of the return on investment and the stochastic discount factor, which determines the effect of the
investment risk premium channel. The degree of price stickiness is important for determining the effects of
the nominal pricing bias.
The investment risk premium channel plays a key role in amplifying the response of investment to changes
in supply-driven uncertainty. The investment risk premium channel has opposite effects on investment for
supply- and demand-side uncertainty. The underlying reason is that physical capital is a poor hedge against
negative TFP shocks, but a good hedge for adverse preference shocks. In particular, demand and supply-side
shocks produce different signs in the covariance between the pricing kernel and the return on investment.
In response to a negative TFP shock, marginal utility increases but the value of physical capital decreases.
Therefore, investment in physical capital commands a positive risk premium with respect to TFP shocks.
In contrast, preference shocks produce the opposite pattern. A negative preference shock increases marginal
utility and the value of capital. Therefore, investment commands a negative risk premium with respect to
preference shocks. Consequently, when supply-side uncertainty increases, households have an incentive to
lower investment so as to reduce exposure to TFP shocks. Instead, when demand-side uncertainty increases,
households have an incentive to increase investment to hedge against preference shocks. Overall, this channel
plays a key role in explaining why the cumulative decline in investment to an increase supply-side (demandside) uncertainty is amplified (dampened).
We then use our decomposition to understand the small response of inflation to demand-driven uncertainty shocks, but a large response to supply-driven uncertainty. These inflation responses can be accounted
for by differences in how the precautionary savings and nominal pricing bias channels operate under the two
uncertainty shocks. Both demand- and supply-side uncertainty shocks trigger a strong precautionary savings
channel effect, which generates downward pressure on inflation. However, for demand-driven uncertainty,
another quantitatively important propagation channel is the nominal pricing bias, which is natural given
that level preference shocks are one of the main drivers of inflation dynamics. For demand-side uncertainty
shocks, the precautionary savings and nominal pricing bias channels have opposite effects on inflation that
cancel each other out, and consequently, the cumulative effect on inflation is close to zero. In contrast,
for supply-side uncertainty, the nominal pricing bias is not quantitatively important, since TFP growth
shocks are not important for explaining inflation dynamics. Therefore, the cumulative effect of an increase
in supply-side uncertainty is driven by the precautionary savings propagation channel, leading to a large
decline in inflation.
Our paper relates to Basu and Bundick (2017) in that we also consider the role of the precautionary

4

savings channel, in conjunction with sticky prices, for the propagation of demand-side uncertainty shocks.
In our estimation, we find that this channel is quantitatively important. Thus, we complement the findings
of Basu and Bundick (2017), but differ along the following dimensions. First, we develop a novel analytical decomposition that unveils four additional risk propagation channels. In our estimation, we find that
two of these four channels, the investment risk premium and nominal pricing bias, are as quantitatively
important as the precautionary savings channel. Second, we conduct a structural estimation of our model
using macroeconomic and bond yield data instead of calibration. In our structural estimation the process
for uncertainty is not exogenously given, but jointly estimated with the rest of the model. We find that uncertainty plays a key role for both macro and term structure dynamics. Finally, we allow for both demandand supply-side uncertainty changes, while Basu and Bundick (2017) only consider demand-side uncertainty
shocks. While both types of uncertainty shocks are important for explaining business cycles, we find that
the macroeconomic responses to these shocks to be quite different. For example, supply-side uncertainty
changes generate more severe recessions, with significantly larger effects on inflation and investment. Our
analytical decomposition allows us to carefully disentangle the economic margins that account for these
different responses.
Our paper connects to the broader literature studying the impact of uncertainty shocks in macroeconomic models (e.g., Bloom (2009), Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten, and Terry (2012),
Bachmann and Bayer (2014), Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, Rubio-Ramı́rez, and Uribe (2011),
Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, Kuester, and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2015), Justiniano and Primiceri
(2008), Bianchi, Ilut, and Schneider (2014), Schaal (2017), Fajgelbaum, Schaal, and Taschereau-Dumouchel
(2017), and Saijo (2017), etc.). We differ from these papers in that we (i) allow for multiple sources of
uncertainty, (ii) conduct a structural estimation, (iii) use asset pricing data, in the form of nominal bond
yields in the estimation and a prior on the investment risk premium, to discipline the effects of uncertainty,
and (iv) do not deviate from the assumption of rational expectations.
The pricing of consumption and volatility risks builds on the endowment economy models of Bansal and
Yaron (2004), Piazzesi and Schneider (2007), and Bansal and Shaliastovich (2013). However, we differ by
considering a general equilibrium framework with production, where the dynamics of stochastic consumption
volatility risks are linked to the time-varying second moments of structural macroeconomic shocks and to
the endogenous response of the macroeconomy to changes in the volatility of these shocks. Furthermore, our
production-based setting allows us to consider the endogenous feedback between risk premia and business
cycle fluctuations via uncertainty shocks. The role of preference shocks for generating a positive real term
premia relates to the endowment economy model of Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2016). We

5

build on this work, and show that time discount factor shocks also provide a novel endogenous source of
inflation risk premia in a New Keynesian framework.
More broadly, our paper relates to an emerging literature studying asset prices in New Keynesian models (e.g., Bekaert, Cho, and Moreno (2010), Bikbov and Chernov (2010), Hsu, Li, and Palomino (2014),
Rudebusch and Swanson (2012), Dew-Becker (2014), Bretscher, Hsu, and Tamoni (2017), Weber (2015),
Kung (2015), and Campbell, Pflueger, and Viceira (2014)). With respect to these papers, we conduct a
structural estimation of a micro-founded model assuming continuity between how assets are priced by the
representative agent in the model and by the econometrician.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a simplified model to introduce the decomposition
of the effects of uncertainty into five distinct risk channels. In this section, we also explain our solution
approach. Section 3 describes the full model. Section 4 contains the main results. Section 5 concludes.

Risk Propagation Channels

To illustrate the key model mechanisms and our solution method, we consider a simplified version of the
benchmark model used for structural estimation. We find that in a New-Keynesian model, uncertainty shocks
can be contractionary – even when the precautionary savings channel places upward pressure on investment
– due to the presence of four other risk propagation channels, unveiled in our analytical decomposition characterized below. Thus, the overall effect of uncertainty is determined by how uncertainty propagates through
the different channels. Analyzing uncertainty changes through the lens of these risk propagation channels
helps us to understand (i) the heterogeneous effects of different uncertainty shocks on the macroeconomy,
(ii) the role of risk premia for imposing restrictions on the propagation channels, and (iii) how various model
frictions pin down the effect of the propagation channels. This approach can be applied to other models and
it is therefore of independent interest.

Log-linearization with risk-adjustment

Our goal is to study the effects of uncertainty on both asset prices and the macroeconomy. If standard loglinearization techniques were applied, all of the effects of uncertainty would be lost. Instead, we implement a
risk-adjusted log-linearization of the model (e.g., Jermann (1998), Lettau (2003), Backus, Routledge, and Zin
(2010), Uhlig (2010), Dew-Becker (2012), Malkhozov (2014), and Bianchi, Ilut, and Schneider (2014)). The
idea behind this approximation method is that all expectational equations are approximated assuming that
the variables are conditionally log-normal. The approximate solution indeed satisfies this condition, because
it is linear in the state variables. Then we solve a resulting system of linear expectational difference equations
augmented with an iterative procedure designed to capture a risk-adjustment component. This procedure
allows us to solve rational expectation models in which uncertainty is controlled by a Markov-switching
process by using solution methods that have been developed for log-linear approximations. It is important
to emphasize that we allow risk to affect not only asset prices, but also the policy functions controlling the
macroeconomic variables. This is crucial to study the effects of uncertainty on the macroeconomy.
We apply the risk adjusted log-linearization to the first-order conditions and market clearing conditions
presented above. Define the risk-free rate, Rf,t as the return on a theoretical risk-free asset, which pays one

10

unit of consumption good in every state of the world next period. The risk-free rate satisfies the following

to the convexity of marginal utility (e.g., Kimball (1990)).
Log-linearizing and risk-adjusting the intertemporal first-order condition of the household (Eq. (8)) and
combining it with the expression for the log risk-free rate (Eq. (31)), we get:

bond in real terms is uncertain. Indeed, the rate of return on this bond in consumption units depends on the
realization of inflation next period. Therefore, the covariance of inflation with the pricing kernel determines
the inflation risk premium on the short-term nominal bond. If inflation tends to be high when the marginal
utility of wealth is high, then nominal short-term bonds are risky and investors demand a risk premium for
holding them.
We log-linearize and risk-adjust the equation characterizing the investment decision of the household,
Eq. (12), and use Eq. (31) to obtain:

Investment Risk Premium

The risk adjustment component in brackets embodies an investment risk premium. If the return on investment is low when the marginal utility of wealth is high, then the return on investment in physical capital
is risky and will command a risk premium. Therefore, in equilibrium, households will choose a level of
investment such that the expected investment return will be higher than the risk-free rate by an amount
sufficient to compensate them for the risk that they are exposed to.

is log investment growth. The risk adjustment term in this equation captures

the fact that when making an investment decision at time t, households consider its impact on the capital

Therefore, the household takes

into account uncertainty about future investment growth and how it co-varies with the shadow value of
capital and the pricing kernel.
Next, consider the price-setting decision of the intermediate firms. We apply the same risk-adjustment
technique to log-linearize the equation characterizing the price-setting decision of the intermediate firms
(Eq. (25)) to obtain the risk-adjusted Phillips Curve:

covariance term between inflation and the pricing kernel relates to the inflation risk premium. In addition,

12

The rest of the equations, which are needed to close the system, do not have terms which depend on
expectations of the endogenous variables. As a result, a simple log-linearization suffices and no additional

Note that this equation is only required to compute the risk-adjustment terms.
To summarize, based on the risk-adjusted log-linearization of the model above, we identify five risk
propagation channels through which uncertainty affects the economy: a precautionary savings motive channel
represented by the risk adjustment terms in the Eq. (33); an inflation risk premium channel represented by
the risk-adjustment terms in the equation for short-term nominal interest rate (Eq. (34)); an investment risk
premium channel captured by the risk adjustment terms in the intertemporal investment decision (Eq. (35));
a nominal pricing bias channel represented by the risk-adjustment terms in the Phillips Curve (Eq. (37)); a
investment adjustment channel captured by the risk adjustment terms in Eq. (36).

Solution Method

The key step for implementing our solution method is realizing that in a model in which stochastic volatility
is modeled as a Markov-switching process, uncertainty at time t only depends on the regime in place at time
t, denoted by ξt . Thus, the system of equations presented above can be written by using matrix notation as
in a standard log-linearization:
Γ0 S t

 Γ1 St1

Γσ Qξt εt

Γη ηt

Γc,ξt ,

(45)

where the DSGE state vector St contains all variables of the model known at time t, Qξt is a regimedependent diagonal matrix with all standard deviation of the shocks on the main diagonal, εt is a vector
with all structural shocks, ηt is a vector containing the expectation errors, and the Markov-switching constant
Γξt captures the effects of uncertainty:

where we have used the fact that uncertainty at time t only depends on the regime in place at time t,
denoted by ξt . Elements of Γc,ξt represent risk adjustment terms. ci , di are vectors of coefficients and ai are
constants, implied by our risk adjustment technique.
However, we cannot compute the volatility terms in Γc,ξt without knowing the solution for St . This is
because to compute the one-step-ahead variance and covariance terms, we need to know how the economy
reacts to the exogenous shocks, εt , and the regime changes themselves. Therefore, we employ the following

of uncertainty. Given the new value for Γ
t
r c,ξ . This iterative procedure continues until the desired level of accuracy is reached. It
and then update Γ
t

is worth emphasizing that only Cξt depends on Γc,ξt , while the matrices, T and R, do not depend on it,
so we only need to iterate on Cξt . Furthermore, standard conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a
stationary solution apply, given that regime changes enter the model additively. Thus, we know that a finite
level of uncertainty exists, as long as a solution exists and the shocks are stationary.
In the solution (Eq. 47), the matrices, T and R, are equivalent to a standard log-linear solution.
Therefore, conditional on the volatility regime, the dynamics of the model are the same as in a standard
log-linear solution. Volatility matters in two ways. First, like in log-linearized models, volatility affects the
size of the innovations, captured by Qξt . Second, volatility affects the level of uncertainty in endogenous
variables. Changes in uncertainty, in turn, impact the risk adjustment term, Cξt , which is not present in a
standard log-linear approximation. This term reflects the endogenous response of the economy to uncertainty
and it is a source of uncertainty itself. Thus, the overall level of uncertainty is larger than in a model with
no risk-adjustment. Thus, the risk adjustment term adjusts the levels of the variables, determines model
dynamics in response to a volatility regime change, and produces additional uncertainty.
Rewrite Eq. (47) in the following form to emphasize dependence of the solution on structural parameters,
p

Importantly, the Markov-switching constant, Cξt

C pξt , θv , θp , H q .

(49)

 C pξt , θv , θp , H q depends on the structural parameters

because for a given volatility of the exogenous disturbances, different structural parameters determine the
various levels of uncertainty. In a standard log-linearization, this term would always be zero. As shown
below, this approach allows us to capture salient asset pricing features despite having approximated a model
with a conditionally linear solution. Furthermore, given that agents are aware of the possibility of regime
changes, uncertainty also depends on the transition matrix, H. Finally, given that regime changes enter the
system of equations additively, the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution are not affected
by the presence of regime changes. The model can then be solved by using solution algorithms developed
for fixed coefficient general equilibrium models (Blanchard and Kahn (1980) and Sims (2002)). The model
can also be solved by using the solution algorithms explicitly developed for MS-DSGE models (Farmer,
Waggoner, and Zha (2009), Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2011), Cho (2016), and Foerster, Rubio-Ramı́rez,
Waggoner, and Zha (2016)), but these methods are more computationally expensive. The appendix shows
that the risk-adjusted log-linearization provides a good approximation of the model solution.

2.5

Uncertainty Decomposition

To understand the role of each of the five risk propagation channels described above, we consider a calibration
of the simplified model. The ensuing analysis shows that the overall effects of the different sources of
uncertainty on the macroeconomy are pinned down by how uncertainty propagates through these different
channels. We find that in a New-Keynesian model, uncertainty shocks can be contractionary and generate
positive comovement between investment and consumption – even when the precautionary savings motive
works in the opposite direction – due to the presence of the four other channels.
Figure 3 displays impulse response functions for an increase in the volatility of the preference shock

16

(panel a) and of the TFP growth shock (panel b). An increase in demand uncertainty generates positive
comovement between consumption, investment, and output (solid red line). The other lines illustrate the
contribution to the overall effect of heightened uncertainty from the following propagation channels: precautionary savings (dashed line), investment risk premium (line with circles), the nominal pricing bias (dotted
line) and investment adjustment channel (dotted line with diamond markers). The inflation risk premium
is not quantitatively important in this calibration and have small overall effects on the economy. Therefore
we plot it separately on a different scale (see Figure 4). The effects of the individual propagation channels
on each variable differ depending on the origin of uncertainty. Importantly, the degree of price adjustment
and capital adjustment costs are important for determining the sign and magnitude of these channels.
With higher supply or demand uncertainty, the precautionary savings channel increases the desire
for saving, reflected in the drop in consumption and a rise in investment. This effect is reflected in the
variance of marginal utility growth, given by Eq. (33). In this calibration, we only have a moderate degree
of price adjustment costs, however with a sufficiently high degree of price stickiness, higher uncertainty will
generate a large enough downward shift in labor demand that translates to a fall in investment, labor hours,
and output, which is the mechanism that Basu and Bundick (2017) uses to produce positive comovement
between macroeconomic aggregates. Importantly, our decomposition in this example illustrates how other
risk propagation channels – namely, the investment risk premium, nominal pricing bias, and investment
adjustment – can also help to offset the positive investment response from the precautionary savings channel
to deliver a negative overall investment response to an increase in uncertainty.
The sign of the investment risk premium channel depends mainly on the covariance between the return
on investment and the pricing kernel (see Eq. 35). This covariance is determined by the response to the
level shocks, and the impulse responses are depicted in Figure 5. The level preference and TFP shocks give
rise to negative comovement between the return on investment and the real stochastic discount factor, which
translates into a positive investment risk premium, on average. Therefore, when uncertainty increases, either
with demand or supply, the investment risk premium rises, as investing in capital becomes riskier; and in
equilibrium, investment declines. The fall in investment generates a subsequent decline in output. The fall
in investment also leads to an increase in consumption through the resource constraint.
The effect of the investment risk premium channel is not quantitatively large for demand-side uncertainty,
because the response of the return on investment to a level preference shock is quantitatively small (see the left
panel in figure 5). Therefore, the preference shock contributes relatively little to the riskiness of investing
in capital. In contrast, for supply-side uncertainty changes, the investment risk premium channel is the
most important for determining the investment response. It is also worth noting that the investment risk

17

premium channel is most important for determining the dynamics of investment relative to its effect on other
macroeconomic quantities. The equity premium is closely tied to the investment risk premium in the model,
and consequently, in our structural estimation, we require this term to be positive on average, and we verify
that it increases with an increase in investment risk.
The investment adjustment channel depends on the volatility of future investment growth, and how it
comoves with the real stochastic discount factor and marginal q (see Eq. 36). Both level supply- and demandside shocks produce similar comovement between these variables, and therefore, both types of uncertainty
propagates through this channel in a similar way. They lead to a decline in investment and output, while
also having a small positive effect on consumption. Qualitatively, the effect is similar to how an uncertainty
shock propagates through the investment risk premium channel.
The nominal pricing bias channel depends on (i) the variance of inflation and (ii) the covariance between
inflation and the real stochastic discount factor, output, and TFP growth (see Eq. 37). The variance
term relates to a precautionary price-setting effect highlighted in Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana,
Kuester, and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2015) that creates a desire for firms to increase prices more when uncertainty
is higher in the presence of sticky prices. However, the sign of the overall effect of the nominal pricing
bias also depends on the comovement between inflation and the pricing kernel, output, and TFP, which are
determined by the responses to the level shocks depicted in Figure 5. A demand shock generates positive
comovement between inflation and the real stochastic discount factor, while a TFP shock generates negative
comovement. Consequently, the response of the macroeconomy to an increase in TFP growth volatility has
the opposite sign with respect to the response to an increase in the volatility of preference shocks. Therefore,
the source of the uncertainty shock plays an important role in determining its effects through this channel.
As mentioned earlier the inflation risk premium channel has small quantitative effects in this calibration,
however for completeness, we provide economic intuition for how the effects of this channel are determined.
The inflation risk premium channel depends on the covariance between the stochastic discount factor and
inflation (see Eq. 34). In Figure 5, we can see that in this calibrated example, a preference shock generates
positive comovement between inflation and the real stochastic discount factor (therefore, positive nominal
term premium), while the technology shock generates negative comovement (therefore, negative nominal term
premium). Given the different signs in the covariances, supply-side and demand-side uncertainty generate
opposite responses (Figure 4).
Both the nominal pricing bias and the inflation risk premium channels depend on the covariance between
the real pricing kernel and inflation, and are therefore tightly linked to nominal term premia. Hence, we can
discipline these channels using asset pricing data, namely, nominal bond yields across different maturities. As

18

we show below, in the estimated model, both supply-side and demand-side uncertainty contribute positively
to term premia, albeit through two very different mechanisms.

Quantitative Model for Estimation

In this section, we describe the full model used for the structural estimation. We enrich the simplified model
from the section above with a series of ingredients that have been proven important to match macroeconomic
dynamics. We also allow for a rich set of shocks to show that even when additional disturbances are introduced, uncertainty plays a key role in explaining the bulk of business cycle and term structure fluctuations.
Overall the estimated model has seven exogenous shocks: preference, TFP growth, monetary policy shock,
markup, relative price of investment, government spending, and liquidity. We also allow for two stochastic
volatility processes to distinguish between supply-side (TFP) and demand-side (preferences) uncertainty.
The volatility processes are modeled as two independent Markov-chains, ξtS and ξtD , with transition matrices
H S and H D , where the letters, S and D, are used to label the supply- and demand-side shocks, respectively.
We then obtain a combined chain, ξt

Empirical Analysis

We estimate the model by using Bayesian methods. The sample 1984:Q2-2015:Q4 is considered. The model
solution retains the key non-linearity represented by regime changes, but it is linear conditional on a regime
sequence. Thus, Bayesian inference can be conducted using Kim’s modification of the basic Kalman filter
to compute the likelihood (i.e., Kim and Nelson (1999)). In addition to the priors on the single model
parameters, we also have priors on the unconditional means of inflation, the real interest rate, the slope

22

of the nominal yield curve, and the investment risk premium. Unlike in a linear model, the unconditional
means of these variables are not pinned down by a single parameter. Thus, these priors induce a joint prior
on the parameters of the model, in a way similar to Del Negro and Schorfheide (2008). The priors for the
model parameters are combined with the likelihood to obtain the posterior distribution.
Eleven observables are used: GDP per-capita growth, inflation, FFR, consumption growth, investment
growth, price of investment growth, one-year yield, two-year yield, three-year yield, four-year yield, and
five-year yield. Given that there are more observables than shocks (i.e., eleven variables compared to seven
shocks), we allow for observation errors on all variables, except for the FFR. We also repeated our estimation
excluding the zero-lower-bound period, with no significant changes in the results. Finally, alternative versions
of the model are estimated, such as, a specification in which both volatility processes are perfectly correlated
or another specification where all shocks exhibit stochastic volatility that are perfectly correlated, but these
versions did not lead to a better fit of the data. As it will become clear below, the data seems to favor a
separation between supply- and demand- side uncertainty shocks.

4.1

Parameter Estimates and Model Fit

Table 1 reports the posterior mean for the structural parameters together with the 90% error bands and the
priors. A few comments are in order. First, we fix the elasticity of intertemporal substitution to 1. Second,
the parameters controlling the magnitude of the price adjustment cost, φR , and the average markup, ν,
cannot be separately identified. Thus, when solving the model, we define and estimate the parameter,
κR

 νφ1 ,
R

while we fix the parameter, ν.6 The resulting estimated value for κR implies an elevated level

of price stickiness, in line with the existing New Keynesian literature. Third, in accordance with previous
results in the literature, we find a more than one-to-one response of the FFR to inflation, despite the long
time spent at the zero lower bound. The fact that the response is well above 1 guarantees that the Taylor
principle is satisfied.
Table 1 reports estimates for the volatilities of the shocks and the persistence of the two regimes. Figure
6 reports the probability of the High volatility regimes (Regime 2 for each chain) for the preference shock
(top panel) and the TFP shock (bottom panel). The high volatility regime for the preference shock is less
persistent than the low volatility regime, while the opposite is true for the high TFP-volatility regime.
Figure 7 compares the variables as implied by our model with the observed variables. Recall that we
have observation error on all variables except for the FFR. The figure shows that the model does a very good
6

The average markup (ν) affects the steady state of the model. For the purpose of computing the steady state
we fix this parameter to 6, a value that implies an average net markup of 20% and that is considered in the ballpark
(see Gali (1999)).

23

job in matching the behavior of both the macro variables and the term structure. We observe some visible
deviations between model-implied and observed variables only for the growth rate of the price of investment.
Thus, observation errors do not play a key role in matching the observed path for yields and macro variables.
The last panel of the figure also shows that the model tracks very well the behavior of the slope of the yield
curve, defined as the difference between the one-year and five-year yields. As we will see below, variations
of the term premium over the business cycle play a key role in generating such a close fit.

4.2

The Effects of Uncertainty

Given that the model allows for two TFP volatility regimes and two preferences volatility regimes, there are
a total of four regimes labeled as follows: (i) Low Preference-Low TFP volatility; (ii) Low Preference-High
TFP volatility; (iii) High Preference-Low TFP volatility; and (iv) High Preference-High TFP volatility. We
are interested in characterizing the level of uncertainty across the four regimes. Uncertainty is computed
taking into account the possibility of regime changes, following the methods developed in Bianchi (2016).
For each variable, zt , we measure uncertainty by computing the conditional standard deviation, sdt pzt

denotes the information available at

time t. We assume that It includes knowledge of the regime in place at time t, the data up to time t, and
the model parameters for each regime, while future regime realizations are unknown. These assumptions
are consistent with the information set available to agents in our model, and so our measure of uncertainty
reflects uncertainty supposedly faced by the agent in the model across the four regimes. Note that there
are two sources of uncertainty. The first one is straightforward: As the size of the Gaussian shocks hitting
the economy increases, uncertainty goes up. The second one is more subtle: The endogenous response of
the macroeconomy to uncertainty is in itself a source of uncertainty. Thus, the magnitude of the response
to uncertainty and the frequency of regime changes matter for the overall level of uncertainty. The relative
contribution of these two sources of uncertainty are described in detail below.
Figure 8 reports the levels of uncertainty across the different regimes. The time horizon s appears on
the x-axis. Solid and dashed lines are used to denote Low and High preference shock volatility regimes,
respectively. Conditional on these line styles, we use lines with dots and without dots to denote Low and
High TFP shock volatility, respectively. Not surprisingly, when both demand-side and supply-side volatilities
are high (dashed-line with dots), uncertainty is high for all variables at all horizons. When only one of the
shocks is in the high volatility regime, the effects differ across the variables. For inflation, the FFR, and
the slope of the yield curve, the main driver of uncertainty is the volatility of the preference shock. Instead,
uncertainty about the growth rate of the real variables is higher when TFP is in the high volatility regime.

24

It is also interesting to notice that uncertainty for consumption and GDP is slightly hump-shaped when
the High TFP volatility regime prevails. In other words, when TFP volatility is high, uncertainty is not
monotonically increasing with the time horizon, as agents are more uncertain about the short-run than the
long-run. This is because two competing forces are at play. On the one hand, events that are further into
the future are naturally harder to predict, as the possibility of shocks and regime changes increase. On the
other hand, in the long run, the probability of still being in the high volatility regime declines.
Figure 9 presents a simulation to understand the impact of these changes in uncertainty on business
cycle fluctuations and the term structure. We take the most likely regime sequence, as presented in Figure
6, and simulate the economy based on the parameters at the posterior mode, setting all Gaussian shocks to
zero. The top left panel reports the cyclical behavior of GDP and the slope of the yield curve implied by
the model. An increase in uncertainty produces a drop in real activity and an increase in the slope of the
yield curve, which consequently generates negative comovement between the slope of the yield curve and
real activity, as in the data (e.g., Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2006)). The four panels in the second and third
row of the figure compare the movements in the slope, GDP, consumption, and investment, induced by the
increase in uncertainty, with the business cycle fluctuations of the actual series. The estimated sequence of
the volatility regimes produces business cycle fluctuations and changes in the slope of the yield curve in a
way that closely tracks the observed fluctuations in the data.
The fluctuations in uncertainty also lead to significant breaks in the term premium. Term premium is
defined as the difference between the yield on a 5-year bond and the expected average short-term yield (1
quarter) over the same five years (following Rudebusch, Sack, and Swanson (2006)). The expected value
is computed taking into account the possibility of regime changes using the methods developed in Bianchi
(2016). The top-right panel of Figure 9 shows that both supply-side and demand-side uncertainty lead to an
increase in the term premium. Specifically, Table 4 shows that the nominal (real) term premia associated
with the different regimes are: (1) Low Preference - Low TFP volatility: 0.58% (0.33%); (2) Low Preference
- High TFP volatility: 0.84% (0.60%); (3) High Preference - Low TFP volatility: 1.03% (0.51%); and (4)
High Preference - High TFP volatility: 1.29% (0.78%). In Subsection 4.4, the mechanisms that lead to these
sizeable premia are explored in detail. For now, we are highlighting that term premia are large and vary
considerably in response to changes in uncertainty.
Our estimated model allows for a rich set of shocks to avoid forcing the estimation to artificially attribute
a large role to the uncertainty shocks. The results presented above suggest that uncertainty shocks can in
fact lead to sizeable fluctuations for both the macroeconomy and bond risk premia. In order to formally
quantify the importance of uncertainty shocks with respect to the other disturbances, we proceed in two

25

steps. First, we compute a variance decomposition by comparing the unconditional variance, as implied by
the model when only one shock is active, to the overall variance. Second, we explore how much variation
in endogenous variables at business cycle frequencies can be generated by uncertainty shocks. We do this
by computing the volatility of business cycle fluctuations in an economy where only uncertainty shocks are
present and comparing it to the volatility of business cycle fluctuations in an economy where both uncertainty
and level shocks are active.7
The decomposition of the unconditional variance for the observables is reported in the left panel of
Table 2. The results confirm that uncertainty shocks play an important role in explaining fluctuations in
the slope of the yield curve (28% of the unconditional variance), but they also account for a large fraction
of the variability of consumption and investment growth (14.26% and 9.67%, respectively). The right panel
of Table 2 highlights that uncertainty shocks appear even more important if we focus on their ability to
generate sizable business cycle fluctuations. Uncertainty shocks explain a substantial part of the variation
in consumption, investment, and output over the business cycle. In particular 24.52% of the variation in
consumption and around 31% of the variation in investment at business cycle frequencies can be explained
by uncertainty shocks. Finally, uncertainty shocks also explain 38.44% of business cycle variation in the
slope of the yield curve, confirming the evidence presented in Figure 9.
Finally, the variance decomposition in the left panel of Table 2 shows that the combination of TFP
shocks, preference shocks, and their corresponding volatility shocks accounts for a very large fraction of the
volatility of the macroeconomy and bond yields. Specifically, these shocks combined account for more than
80% of the variance of GDP growth, for more than 90% of the variance of consumption growth, for more
than 85% of the variance of investment growth, and for almost 60% of the variance of inflation and the slope
of the term structure of interest rates. The only other shock that plays a significant role is the markup shock.
However, this shock only appears to account for high-frequency movements in the volatility of inflation, as
it is often the case in estimated New-Keynesian models. Thus, the combination of first and second moments
shocks to TFP and preferences account for the bulk of the volatility of the observed variables, despite the
fact that we allow for a series of other shocks, like the liquidity shock, that generally play a significant role in
the estimation of New-Keynesian DSGE models without the risk-adjustment. This suggests that extending
standard estimation technique to include the first-order effects of uncertainty shocks can significantly change
the importance of the other shocks, possibly allowing for more parsimonious models to explain the observed
fluctuations.
7

From a technical point of view the contribution of uncertainty shocks is given by the amount of volatility generated
by the Markov-switching constant.

26

4.3

Inspecting the Mechanism

To better understand the mechanisms at work, we decompose the effects of the uncertainty shocks into the
five risk propagation channels that were discussed in the context of the simplified model of Section 2: Precautionary savings, investment risk premium, inflation risk premium, nominal pricing bias, and investment
adjustment. The results show that the origins of uncertainty are important to understand its effects.
Figure 10 presents the median and 90% error bands for the impulse responses to a demand-side (dashed
line) and a supply-side (solid line) uncertainty shock, while Figure 11 presents the median and 90% error
bands for the difference between these impulse responses. Impulse responses are computed as the change
in the expected path of the endogenous variables following an initial impulse, in line with the way impulse
responses are computed for shocks to levels. Specifically, these impulse responses assume a shift from low to
high uncertainty in the first period, but from that point on they are computed integrating out future regime
changes. Thus, the impulse responses are conceptually different from the simulations reported in Figure 9
where the posterior mode regime sequence was imposed.
Despite these technical differences that take into account uncertainty about the future regime path,
uncertainty shocks still emerge as a driving force of the business cycle. Both demand- and supply-side
uncertainty shocks generate positive comovement between consumption, investment, output, as there is an
economic contraction following heightened macroeconomic uncertainty. Also, higher uncertainty increases
the nominal and real slope and term premia, consistent with the observed dynamics in the data. However, a
supply-side uncertainty shock leads to a much larger decline in inflation. Furthermore, the recession generated
by a supply-side uncertainty shock is visibly larger, as confirmed by the first row of Figure 10. The effects
on term premia are also quantitatively different, with the supply-side uncertainty shock generating a smaller
increase in the nominal term premium and a larger increase in the real term premium.
Figure 12 decomposes the effect of uncertainty increases for preferences (Panel a) and in TFP (Panel b).
Note that, in contrast to the calibrated simplified model presented above, the precautionary savings channel
generates positive comovement between consumption, investment, and output. In our estimated model, the
magnitude of price adjustment costs is sufficiently high that it flips the sign of investment (due to a larger
downward shift in labor demand). However, while this channel plays a key role in driving consumption down
following an uncertainty shock, other channels play an equally important role to understand the effects of
uncertainty on the other macroeconomic variables.
When the economy experiences a supply-side uncertainty shock, the investment risk channel is equally
(and at certain horizons more) important than the precautionary savings channel in determining a decline

27

in investment. On the other hand, when the economy experiences a demand-side uncertainty shock, the
risk propagation channel works in the opposite direction and mitigates the decline in investment. Thus,
demand and supply uncertainty propagate differently through the investment risk premium channel. The
difference is determined by how the shadow value of capital responds to adverse demand and supply shocks
(figure 13). For the household, capital works as a hedge against adverse preference shocks, because the
return on investment is positive in a state of the world with high marginal utility of wealth (high SDF). The
opposite is true for a negative TFP shock, as the return on investment is negative in the high SDF state.
So, when supply side uncertainty increases, the effect of the investment risk premium channel is driven by
investment becoming riskier and households, keeping all else equal, optimally choosing to cut investment. In
contrast, when demand uncertainty increases, investment becomes less risky and the effect of this channel
is determined by the household choosing a relatively higher level of investment than it would choose if
investment risk premium remained constant.
Importantly, the net effect of demand-side uncertainty on investment is still negative because of the
combined effect of the precautionary savings and nominal pricing bias channels. Indeed, when the economy
experiences a demand-side uncertainty shock, the nominal pricing bias channel contributes to the decline in
consumption and investment. In response to an increase in demand-side uncertainty the nominal price bias
determines effects similar to a markup shock, given that it enters the New-Keynesian Phillips curve in an
isomorphic way. Inflation goes up, consumption and investment go down. This contributes to exacerbating
the recession while mitigating the effects on inflation.
The decomposition also helps in understanding why the response of inflation is so muted in the two
cases. In both cases, the precautionary savings channel determines deflationary pressure. However, following
a demand-side uncertainty shock the pricing bias channel essentially nullifies the effects on inflation, while
in the case of the supply-side uncertainty shock this channel plays a very little role. To understand why, it is
useful to revisit the impulse responses presented in Figure 13. Inflation experiences a persistent increase in
response to a demand shock, while a supply shock has very little quantitative impact on inflation dynamics.
As a result, the nominal pricing bias channel is not quantitatively important for supply side uncertainty:
Firms do not adjust their price-setting decision, as supply side uncertainty has limited impact on uncertainty
about future inflation. In contrast, the preference shock is an important driver of inflation dynamics, and
demand-side uncertainty directly translates into uncertainty about future inflation. Hence, the nominal
pricing bias is an important determinant of the economy’s response to demand-side uncertainty.
Finally the other two channels, inflation risk premium and investment adjustment, have small quantitative effects.

28

4.4

Yield Curve

In this section, we provide more details about the fit of the model and the mechanisms at play by inspecting
the ability of the model of matching movements in the term structure. We already conducted a first check on
the fit of the model in Figure 7 showing that the yields across various maturities, as implied by our model,
track very closely observed yields despite allowing for observation errors on all variables, except for the FFR.
In what follows, we analyze how the model is able to match the dynamics of yields and the slope so closely.
Table 3 reports the nominal and real yield curve as implied by our estimated model. Our model generates
an upward-sloping real and nominal yield curve with sizable average term spreads. Both preference and
TFP shocks are important for generating the unconditional real term premium, while the preference shock
is important for generating the unconditional inflation risk premium. It is worth emphasizing that in our
estimated model, the endogenous risk premium is significantly more important than the liquidity premium
in generating nominal premia and the only determinant of real premia. The liquidity premium is the
premium arising from a linear term that captures the preference of the household for short-term bonds, and
it is controlled by the parameter, ζB . Thus, liquidity shocks seem to play only a small role for explaining
business cycle fluctuations, and moreover, the liquidity premium seems less important in determining term
premia compared to the risk-based channels.
The right side of Table 3 shows that the overall nominal term premium is 0.96%, generating an unconditional slope of the term structure very much in line with the data (1.05%). The risk premium accounts
for the bulk of the term premium: 0.90% Vs. 0.06%. The real term premium is 0.56% and it is all due to
the risk premium arising from the preference and TFP shocks. To understand the relative importance of
demand-side versus supply-side uncertainty in generating the premia, we consider a counterfactual simulation
in which the standard deviations of all shocks are set to zero, except for preference (TFP) shocks. When
only preference (TFP) shocks are allowed, the nominal term premium is 0.77% (0.29%), while with only
preference (TFP) shocks, the real term premium is 0.26% (0.34%). These results show that demand-side
uncertainty is relatively more important in determining the nominal term premium, while the two sources of
uncertainty contribute to the real term premia of a similar magnitude. Next, we study how the two sources
of uncertainty lead to sizable risk premia.
Persistent shocks to time discount rates coupled with recursive preferences contributes significantly to
both the real term premia and inflation risk premia. To understand the mechanism behind this finding,
Figure 14 presents the impulse responses to such a shock for some key variables. A negative preference shock
(less patience) induces household to consume more and save less, which decreases the wealth-to-consumption

29

ratio. A drop in the wealth-to-consumption ratio implies a decline in the return on a claim to aggregate
consumption. When agents prefer an early resolution of uncertainty (ψ

¡ 1{γ), a decrease in the return on

the consumption claim increases marginal utility. When the shock is persistent, this leads to a sharp increase
in marginal utility. A persistent negative time preference shock also increases the real rate persistently, which
erodes the payoffs of long real bonds more than short ones. Given that a negative time preference shock is
associated with high marginal utility, long real bonds provide less insurance against bad states of the world
relative to short real bonds. In equilibrium, this helps to generate an upward-sloping real yield curve and a
positive real term premia, in a way similar to Albuquerque, Eichenbaum, Luo, and Rebelo (2016).
The time preference shock endogenously generates a negative relation between marginal utility and
inflation, which translates into positive inflation risk premia increasing with maturity. A persistent negative
time preference shock increases aggregate demand, which raises inflation persistently. The negative time
preference shock is also associated with high marginal utility as discussed above. Persistently higher inflation
erodes the value of long nominal bonds more than short nominal bonds during high marginal utility states.
Consequently, the nominal yield curve is upward-sloping.
The persistent TFP growth shocks in conjunction with habits contributes positively to real term premia. A negative TFP growth shock decreases consumption today relative to habit (proportional to lagged
consumption), decreasing surplus consumption (i.e., the difference between consumption and habits), and
raising marginal utility. However, next period, the habit catches up and increases expected surplus consumption growth. This induces a borrowing motive to smooth surplus consumption, which therefore increases
the real rate akin to Wachter (2006). A persistent increase in the real rate erodes the value of long-term
real bonds more than short-term ones. Therefore long-term real bonds provide less insurance against high
marginal utility states induced by negative TFP shocks, which contributes to the upward-sloping real yield
curve and positive real term premia. However, the TFP shocks do not generate significant inflation risk
premia as TFP shocks have a very small effect on inflation (see Figure 13). Therefore, the impact of TFP
shocks on the nominal term premia are primarily through the real term premia component.
Table 4 illustrates how the dynamics of real and nominal term premia are driven by the preference
and TFP uncertainty shocks. As preference uncertainty shocks contribute significantly to the unconditional
real term premia and inflation risk premia, changes in demand-side uncertainty generates sizable variation
in the conditional real term premia and the conditional inflation risk premia. In contrast, TFP uncertainty
shocks mainly contribute to real term premia and not towards inflation risk premia since the level TFP
shocks mainly contribute to the unconditional real term premia. Quantitatively, changes in demand-side
uncertainty produce large fluctuations in term premia through the effects on inflation risk premia.

30

4.5

Informational Content of the Term Structure

Given the importance of demand- and supply-side uncertainty for term premia movements, the use of term
structure data in our estimation is crucial for identifying the overall effects of uncertainty and distinguishing
between the two types of uncertainty. Figures 15 and 16 plot the impulse response functions for demand
and supply uncertainty shocks from our benchmark estimation using term structure data (solid line) and an
estimation without using term structure data (dashed line). Interestingly, the estimated effects of demandside uncertainty are significantly amplified using term structure data than without, while the effects are
muted for supply-side uncertainty. As demand-side uncertainty is more important for nominal term premia
compared to supply-side uncertainty, including term structure data in the estimation therefore increases the
relative importance of demand-side uncertainty.
Figure 17 illustrates that the inclusion of term structure data in the estimation affects the timing,
duration, and importance of uncertainty shocks. In particular, comparing this figure with Figure 9, it is
evident that using term structure data provides valuable information for the role of uncertainty in explaining
business cycle fluctuations. When the term structure is not included, periods of high uncertainty have a
shorter duration and produce smaller effects. Furthermore, in the 1991 recession there is no visible effect
from the increase in demand-side uncertainty, consistent with the impulse responses from Figure 15. Overall,
when the term structure is not included, liquidity shocks become more important for explaining business cycle
fluctuations as they account for around 77% and 29% of investment and consumption volatility, respectively,
compared to 2.31% and 0.94% in the benchmark estimation. On the other hand, the estimation excluding
the term structure also implies a counterfactual yield curve, as the unconditional nominal slope is only
0.27%, with most of the nominal spread coming from the real curve (see Table 5). This is due to the fact
that demand shocks are a key source of inflation risk premia, but when term structure data is excluded, the
role of demand shocks are significantly reduced as illustrated in Figure 15. Thus, the term structure encodes
important information about uncertainty and macroeconomic fluctuations, and also disciplines the relative
importance of liquidity shocks. The joint estimation exploits the strong relation between the slope of the
yield curve, business cycle fluctuations, and uncertainty.

Conclusion

This paper quantitatively explores the effects of different macroeconomic uncertainty shocks on business
cycle and asset pricing fluctuations. We build and estimate a DSGE model that features realistic bond
risk premia. We estimate the model using macroeconomic data, the term structure of interest rates, and

31

imposing restrictions on the average investment risk premium. Our model allows for stochastic changes in
the volatility of demand-side (preferences) and supply-side (TFP) shocks, while at the same time controlling
for other disturbances often included in the estimation of New-Keynesian DSGE models. Uncertainty shocks
are triggered by changes in stochastic volatility, but the endogenous response of the macroeconomy to these
changes is in itself a source of uncertainty.
We study the effects of uncertainty through the lens of a novel decomposition that identifies five endogenous risk propagation mechanisms: precautionary savings, investment risk premium, inflation risk premium,
nominal pricing bias, and investment adjustment channels. The effects arising from the investment and inflation risk premia channels are disciplined by the investment risk and nominal term premia, respectively.
We find sizable effects of changes in uncertainty. Both demand-side and supply-side generate a positive
comovement in consumption, investment, and output. The responses of inflation and term premia differ
depending on the source of uncertainty. Supply-side uncertainty leads to larger contractions in both investment and consumption. These differences are explained in light of the way uncertainty propagates through
the real economy. In response to an increase in supply-side uncertainty, an increase in the risk of investing in
physical capital contributes to determine a larger recession. Instead, when demand-side uncertainty is high,
investment in capital becomes more attractive, reducing the fall in investment. In response to an increase
in demand-side uncertainty, the negative effects on inflation from the precautionary savings channel are
nullified by a nominal bias in pricing. The joint estimation of macro and yield curve variables put additional
discipline on the relative importance of these channels, as the model is also asked to account for the negative
comovement between term premia and the macroeconomy. Overall, our results highlight the importance of
accounting for the origins of macroeconomic uncertainty and for using asset prices to discipline the various
risk propagation channels for uncertainty.

Figure 3: Calibrated model. The impulse responses represent a change in the expected path of
the corresponding variable in response to a volatility regime changes. The units of the y-axis are
percentage deviations from a steady state (values for inflation, FFR and Slope are annualized).
Units on the x axis are quarters. The red solid line depicts the total effect of the volatility regime
change. The black dashed line shows the contribution of the precautionary savings motive. The
black line with circles shows the contribution of the channel operating through change in risk
premium on investment return. The black dotted line shows the contribution of a channel operating
through the nominal pricing bias. The dotted line with diamond markers shows the contribution of
the investment adjustment channel. We use the following parameter values: β  0.996, ρβ  0.98,

Figure 8: Uncertainty. The figure reports the level of uncertainty at different horizons. Uncertainty
is computed taking into account the possibility of regime changes.

Figure 9: Uncertainty-driven fluctuations. The figure plots selected variables from the simulation
of the model with estimated volatility regime sequence (all Gaussian shocks are set to zero in
this simulation). Top left panel: simulated path of GDP, expressed in log-deviations from steady
state, and slope of the yield curve, expressed as a difference between 5-year yield and 1-year
yield. Top right panel: simulated dynamic of nominal term premium in the model, expressed as a
difference between 5-year nominal yield and an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal bond
over the next 20 quarters. Middle left panel: simulated slope of the yield curve and slope of the
yield curve observed in the data. The subsequent panels plot the model-implied path of GDP,
consumption, and investment in response to changes in uncertainty and the cyclical components of
the corresponding series in the data (obtained using bandpass filter). Units on the y-axis for macro
variables are percentage points (model and data). Units on the y-axis for Term premium and Slope
are annualized percent (data and model).

Figure 10: Responses to uncertainty shocks. This figure plots impulse responses to a change from
low uncertainty regime to high uncertainty regime for preference and TFP growth shocks. The
gray areas represent 90% credible sets. The impulse responses are computed as the change in
the expected path of the corresponding variables when the volatility regime changes. The figure
plots impulse responses of consumption, investment, GDP, inflation, Fed Funds Rate (1-quarter
nominal interest rate), the slope of the yield curve expressed as the difference between 5-year and
1-year nominal yields, nominal term premium defined as the difference between 5-year nominal
yield and an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal bond over the next 20 quarters, the real
term premium defined as the difference between 5-year real yield and an expected average yield on
1-quarter real bond over the next 20 quarters, the real slope expressed as the difference between
5-year and 1-year real yields. The units of the y-axis are percentage deviations from a steady
state (values for inflation, interest rates and term premia are annualized). Units on the x axis are
quarters.

Figure 11: Heterogenous effects of uncertainty. This figure plots the difference between the impulse
responses to demand and supply uncertainty. The gray areas represent 90% credible sets. The
impulse responses are computed as the change in the expected path of the corresponding variables
when the volatility regime changes. The figure plots impulse responses of consumption, investment,
GDP, inflation, Fed Funds Rate (1-quarter nominal interest rate), the slope of the yield curve
expressed as the difference between 5-year and 1-year nominal yields, nominal term premium defined
as the difference between 5-year nominal yield and an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal
bond over the next 20 quarters, the real term premium defined as the difference between 5-year
real yield and an expected average yield on 1-quarter real bond over the next 20 quarters, the real
slope expressed as the difference between 5-year and 1-year real yields. The units of the y-axis are
percentage deviations from a steady state (values for inflation, interest rates and term premia are
annualized). Units on the x axis are quarters.

Figure 12: Inspecting the mechanism. The impule responses represent a change in the expected path
of corresponding variables when volatility regime changes. The units of the y-axis are percentage
deviations from a steady state (values for inflation and FFR are annualized). Units on the x axis
are quarters. The red solid line depicts an IRF to volatility regime change in a benchmark model.
The black dashed line shows the contribution of a precautionary savings motive. The black line
with circles shows the contribution of the channel operating through change in the risk premium
on investment return. The black line with crosses shows the contribution of inflation risk premium
channel. The black dotted line shows the contribution of the nominal pricing bias channel. The

Figure 17: Uncertainty-driven fluctuations in an estimated model without the term structure. The
figure plots selected variables from the simulation of the model estimated without asset pricing
data. The simulation only considers the effects of uncertainty based on the estimated regime
sequence (all Gaussian shocks are set to zero in this simulation). Top left panel: simulated path
of GDP, expressed in log-deviations from steady state, and slope of the yield curve, expressed
as a difference between 5-year yield and 1-year yield. Top right panel: simulated dynamic of
nominal term premium in the model, expressed as a difference between 5-year nominal yield and
an expected average yield on 1-quarter nominal bond over the next 20 quarters. Middle left panel:
simulated slope of the yield curve and slope of the yield curve observed in the data. The subsequent
panels plot the model-implied path of GDP, consumption, and investment in response to changes
in uncertainty and the cyclical components of the corresponding series in the data (obtained using
bandpass filter). Units on the y-axis for macro variables are percentage points (model and data).
Units on the y-axis for Term premium and Slope are annualized percent (data and model).

Table 2: The left panel presents the contribution of the different shocks to the unconditional
variance of the macroeconomic variables and the slope of the yield curve. The right panel analyzes
the importance of uncertainty shocks in generating business cycle fluctuations with respect to
the traditional level shocks. Specifically, we use the posterior mode parameter values to simulate
two economies 1,000 times. In the first economy, only uncertainty shocks occur. In the second
economy, we have level shocks on top of the same uncertainty shocks. For each simulation and
for each variable we extract business cycle fluctuations using a bandpass filter. Finally, for each
simulation we compute the ratio between the volatilities of the business cycle fluctuations for the
two economies.

Appendix. Accuracy test

To assess the accuracy of the log-linear solution with risk adjustment employed in this paper, we
conduct a Den Haan and Marcet (1994) test for the estimated model. We simulate 5000 economies
for 3500 periods and drop first 500 observations using the posterior mode for the parameter values.
We use the conditionally linear policy functions for consumption, value function, and nominal
interest rate to compute the time path of the corresponding variables. We then use the original
non-linear Euler equation (64) to compute realized Euler equation errors:

Under the null hypothesis this statistic has a chi-squared distribution. We obtain 5, 000 statistics,
one for each simulated economy and we check how many of them are above the 95% and below
the 5% chi-squared critical values. Table 6 shows that the percentages of realized test statistics
below 5% and above 95% critical values of a χ2 distribution are very close to the theoretical ones.
This result shows that our log-linearization approach with risk adjustment terms provides a good
