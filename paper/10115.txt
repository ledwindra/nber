Cross-Border Valuation: The International Cost of Equity Capital
Gordon M. Bodnar, Bernard Dumas, and Richard C. Marston
NBER Working Paper No. 10115
November 2003
JEL No. G3, F3
ABSTRACT
How does a firm in one country evaluate an investment in a firm in another country, or how does it evaluate
a foreign project that the firm itself is undertaking? The firm must estimate future free cash flows just as in
a domestic project, but choosing an appropriate discount rate is a particular challenge. This study examines
the determinants of the discount rate for an international acquisition or project by examining the sources of
risk in an international setting. These risks include stock-market price risk measured with various versions
of the capital asset pricing model, as well as exchange rate risk and political risk. To measure stock market
risk, both segmented and integrated models of the world equity markets are considered. The emphasis of the
study is on some of the practical aspects of estimation, particular for markets where no comparable
investments exist on which to base estimates of risk premiums. To show how each of these risks might be
measured, the study reports estimates for a representative French firm, Thalès. The estimates range widely
depending on whether or not the equity market is globally integrated.

How does a firm in one country evaluate an investment in a firm in another
country, or how does it evaluate a foreign project that the firm itself is undertaking? Both
questions are increasingly important as international mergers and acquisitions grow and
as firms become more multinational in their operations. As in domestic finance, answers
to these questions require that the firm estimate future free cash flows to equity of the
investment and discount these cash flows at some appropriate discount rate. The discount
rate reflects the investment’s cost of equity financing.
Domestic finance teaches us that the classic Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
allows a systematic comparison of the costs of equity of various traded firms. The classic
CAPM recognizes but one source of risk and one risk premium to be charged on a share
of stock; namely, the systematic risk or risk of covariation of the stock with the broader
equity market, captured by the equity's β.2 The discount rate for equity-financed projects
is based on this β times the equity market premium, or the excess return of the broad
equity market portfolio over the risk-free rate. In the international setting, it’s not
obvious which country’s equity market premium should be used in the evaluation, that of
the acquiring firm or that of the target firm. In the international setting, moreover, the
matter is more complicated because there may be more dimensions of risk for which
financial market participants require a premium. The focal point of the discussion is then
the method by which the various dimensions of risk are incorporated in the cost of equity
that we seek.

2

More recent forms of the CAPM recognize that there may exist more than one risk premium that the
market charges on a share of stock. See Fama and French (1996).

3

The following example will help to illustrate some of the issues involved in crossborder cost of capital estimation. In July 1998, the Indonesian government decided to
privatize a cement firm, PT Semen Gresik, opening the bidding to firms throughout the
world. Cemex, a Mexico based firm, competed with Holcim, a Switzerland based firm,
in the bidding process. In advising Cemex, the French investment bank Paribas proposed
to base the bid on a discounted cash flow model using CAPM as the basis for valuation.
But which country’s stock market premium should be used for this valuation, that of the
Indonesian market or the Mexican market? The valuation might vary widely depending
on whether the CAPM was applied to one market or another. Would Holcim evaluate the
Indonesian firm differently because it was based in Switzerland? How should Cemex
take into account the political risk associated with ending of the Suharto regime? The
CAPM is not suited to measure political risk, so how should the discount rate for the
project be adjusted to account for this additional risk?
If the world’s stock markets were fully integrated, acquiring firms from different
countries would evaluate an acquisition in the same way. Cemex, and Holcim, would
base their discount rates for the acquisition on the same (world-wide) equity premium.
Since both potential acquirers would measure the beta of PT Semen Gresik vis-à-vis the
same world index, they would use the same discount rate for the cash flows (in a given
currency). If the cash flows expected by each bidding firm were identical, Cemex and
Holcim would come up with the same valuation for the Indonesian firm. But what if
markets are not fully integrated? What approach does one use then? ? This study will
consider these questions directly.

4

A second example will illustrate an additional problem with measuring the cost of
equity capital. In November 1994, Westmoreland Coal Company, a U.S. based firm,
intended to invest $ 540 million in an electric power project located in Zhangze, China.
In the Chinese market, there is no comparable publicly-traded project from which to
calculate a local β. This is a common problem in many projects in developing
economies. Should Westmoreland measure the beta using the returns of electric
companies in the U.S.? How should it adjust those returns for the beta of China’s market
vis-à-vis the U.S. market? If so, should it use China’s equity premium or the U.S. equity
premium? And how should it account for China’s political risk? These are the types of
questions addressed in this study.
Let’s just focus on equity premiums alone. A record of equity premiums in
sixteen countries, based on one hundred yearly observations is provided in a recent book
by Dimson, Marsh and Staunton, Triumph of the Optimists (2002). Figure 1 displays
these equity premiums measured in the respective local currency. Because the currency
units differ, these numbers are not directly comparable. Currency movements, however,
are not so large as to dramatically alter the general picture: equity premiums differ from
country to country. Their differences are economically meaningful: many more
investment projects would be deemed acceptable when using the equity premium of
Denmark (below 4%/year) than when using the equity premium of Italy (11%/year).
Furthermore, differences would be even more stark if more countries were considered, or
if sub-periods of the 20th century were examined.

5

Nonetheless, many of these differences are not statistically significant.3 This
observation led Goetzman and Jorion (1997) to entertain the hypothesis that the
differences observed across countries were only differences arising from statistical
sampling. Investors invested in Italy during the 20th century turned out to be lucky but
they did not expect such a return. Therefore, one should not look at the numbers in

Figure 1: Equity returns around the world 1900-2000, yearly
observations; local currencies.

Figure 1 as having differed ex ante or as representing expected returns that were required
by investors. They are just differences in the realized averages. Under this hypothesis, the
premium based on the largest number of observations, namely the world premium, is the
best estimate we have.4 It turns out to be equal to 6.2%.5
3

In Figure 1, the right-hand scale is for standard deviations. The lines, as opposed to the bars, indicate the
standard deviations of the realized premiums of each year (the rate of return of that year in excess of the
riskless rate in the local currency) or of the deflated return. The standard deviations of the estimates of
expected values of equity premiums are equal to these numbers divided by √100 = 10, since there are 100
years of observations in this sample. This gives a visual impression of the degree of significance.
4
The world equity premium is weighted by the market capitalizations of the various countries, whereas the
most reliable estimate (the most efficient, in statistical language) should be weighted in inverse proportion
to the variance of the average equity premium of each country.

6

To the extent that equity premiums differ across the world in an economically
meaningful way and to the extent that some are statistically significantly different from
each other, one would like to know, when evaluating a project in a country, whether one
should use the local premium (the premium observed in the country where the project is
to be undertaken), the home premium (the premium observed in the country where capital
comes from) or the world premium. One would also like to know whether the differences
in premiums are the sign of some segmentation of the financial markets of the world
along country lines. In other words, is capital cheaper in some places than others? If it
is, a further recommendation can be provided concerning the market where capital should
be raised.
The balance of this study is organized as follows. In Section 1, we review briefly
the dimensions of risk that prevail in the world economy and that are systematic enough
to receive a non-zero price in the financial market(s) of the world. In Section 2, we
describe the way in which the classic CAPM could be applied in a world context. In
Section 3, we consider the possibility that each dimension of risk could receive a
different price, the various premiums being added together to reach the total required rate
of return. We call this model the multi-β, or hybrid, CAPM. In Section 4, we show that
currency risk is a dimension of risk, which theoretically should receive a special price,
leading to the so-called “International CAPM”. In Section 5, we briefly discuss the
pricing of political risk. Finally, in Section 6, we consider the delicate problem of
5

Fama and French (2002) take that line of reasoning one step further. Even the most reliable estimate, say
the world average, is only an estimate, or a realized number, not an expected rate of return. We may have
legitimate reasons to argue that the realized average is too large or too small. Suppose, for instance, that it
can be argued that required returns have slowly drifted down during the second half of the 20th century.
During that period, therefore, stock prices rose, producing higher than expected rates of returns. When we
look at these realized returns ex post as estimates of ex ante, or expected, or required, returns, we make a
mistake.

transposing required premiums observed on a subset of securities, say the equity of
corporations operating in a subset of countries, to another subset of securities, a problem
which arises in many practical situations, especially when investing in developing
countries. Section 7, the conclusion, recapitulates the main points made in this study.

1. The dimensions of risk in the world
The main lesson of portfolio theory is that only systematic risks, i.e. risks to
which many securities are exposed, can fetch a non-zero premium in the financial market.
An investor who bears other dimensions of risk, that are specific to each security,
receives no reward because he could have diversified that risk away.
What are the dimensions of risk in the world financial market that are sufficiently
systematic to receive a non-zero reward? We can think of at least six such dimensions.
For each dimension, it is not enough to surmise that it receives a non-zero price. We
need also have in mind some index of security market prices that uniquely carries this
risk and can, therefore, help us determine what the going price is.
•

The world stock-market price risk. The classic CAPM says that this is the only
systematic source of risk but we intend to go beyond the classic CAPM. The index of
traded securities that carries this risk is, of course, the worldwide stock market index.
The fundamental source of this dimension of risk is the fluctuation in worldwide
business activity.

•

The stock-market price risk of each country. This risk is specific to the securities of
that country, but systematic to all of them. The index that carries this risk is each

8

country’s stock market index.6 The fundamental source of this dimension of risk is
the fluctuation in the country’s business activity. When world and country dimensions
are taken into account jointly, the fundamental source of this dimension of risk is the
fluctuation in the country’s business activity that deviates from world business
activity.
•

The stock-market price risk of each industry. This risk is specific to the securities
issued by firms of that industry, but systematic to all of them. The index that carries
this risk is each industry’s stock market index calculated across the world.7 The
fundamental source of this dimension of risk is the worldwide fluctuation in the
industry’s business activity. When world, country, and industry dimensions are taken
into account jointly, the fundamental source of this dimension of risk is the
fluctuation in the industry’s business activity that deviates from world and countries’
business activity.

•

Exchange rate risk affects many firms, depending on their foreign-exchange
exposures. The index of return is provided by returns on foreign-currency deposits.

•

Political risk cum crisis risk comprises the risk that the securities issued by entities of
a country may be in default. It is the risk generally that legal, financial contracts will
not be enforced. A possible return index is provided by sovereign bonds returns. We
discuss in Section 5 the validity of these returns as indexes of political risk pricing.

6

As an alternative to calculating stock market index return for each country, which is an arithmetic
average of securities return that trade on the stock market of the country, one can utilize a cross-sectional
statistical technique that reveals the factor, i.e., the dimension of rates of return, that is common to all the
securities of the country (here this can mean the securities that trade on the stock market of the country, or
it can mean the securities of the firms that operate in the country). See the various models of the consulting
firm BARRA, or the work of Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994). The drawback of this approach is that it
posits that a firm listed in one country has an exposure equal to 1 to the country factor.
7
Here again, one can utilize a cross-sectional statistical technique that reveals the factor that is common to
all the securities of the industry. This approach would posit that a firm belonging to an industry has an
exposure equal to 1 to the industry factor.

9

•

Liquidity risk is a dimension of risk that is especially present in developing capital
markets. It represents the risk that capital gains indicated by stock market quotes can
never be realized, because an attempt to realize them would produce a negative price
impact. An index can be provided by the difference in rates of return between less
liquid and highly liquid company shares, or by differences in rates of return between
country capital markets where liquidity is low and those where liquidity is high. We
do not discuss this dimension of risk any further in this study.8

2. The classic CAPM applied to the world
The classic CAPM asserts that the risk carried by the market portfolio is the only
dimension of risk that is priced. However, when applying the classic CAPM to the
securities that exist in the world, one is confronted with a decision: which is the relevant
market portfolio, the portfolio of the country of the investment, the portfolio of the
country of the investor, or a global market portfolio? It depends whether we are ready to
believe that the world financial market is fully integrated or, to the opposite, fully
segmented along country borders. Intermediate situations will be discussed in Section 3.

2.1. Full segmentation
If the world is fully segmented, investors of one country only have access to the
securities issued by the companies that trade in that country. A “domestic CAPM”
prevails in each country. According to that form of the CAPM, β is measured relative to

8

On this point, see: Chordia, Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1998) and Chordia, Roll and Subrahmanyam
(2001).

10

the country’s market index and the equity premium to be applied is the local market
premium:9
E [Ri − r ] = β i / c × E [Rc − r ]

(1)

In this expression, βi/c and the expected equity premium on the local stock market, E[Rc –
r], together determine the risk premium on the firm’s equity, E[Ri – r].
In the situation of complete market segmentation, it is necessarily the case that the
shareholders of a company are home stockholders, unless the company is listed in several
countries or has issued Depositary Receipts in foreign countries. If a firm contemplates
an investment abroad, therefore, it should use the CAPM of its home country. It should
measure the β of the foreign investment, or that of a comparable traded company, relative
to its home equity market, but it should charge the market premium that prevails in its
home market:
As an illustration, Table 1 shows the calculation of the required premium (or
required excess expected rate of return) in dollar units on the French firm Thalès (ex
Thomson-CSF) from the point of view of US stockholders in the hypothetical, fullsegmentation situation in which they hold US assets only. This required premium is to be
added to the current value of the riskless dollar rate of interest, to obtain a required rate of
return. Table 2, by contrast, shows the same calculation, with a different result, from the
point of view of a French investor who holds only French assets, abstracting from the fact
that a French investor would not want to calculate a required rate of return in dollar units.

As is well known, the coefficient β is equal to the slope coefficient of a simple regression, in this case, of
the (excess) rate of return of a firm’s equity in the stock market on the (excess) rate of return of the country
market portfolio. It is the exposure of that firm’s equity to the home market risk.

The betas measured relative to the two markets are quite different. However, perhaps by
accident, the risk premiums are almost the same.

2.2. Full integration
If the world is fully integrated, a company’s stockholders come from many
different countries because it is assumed that each one holds a globally diversified
portfolio. For all investors, a “worldwide, classic CAPM” prevails in which the return
premium to any investment, when measured in a specific currency unit, is the same for all
investors. This is because each security’s β is measured vis-à-vis the world market index
and the market premium to be used is the world equity premium:
E [Ri − r ] = β i / w × E [Rw − r ]

(2)

If a firm contemplates an investment abroad under a full integration assumption,
it should use the “worldwide, classic CAPM”. It should measure the β of the foreign
12

investment, or that of a comparable traded company, relative to the world equity market
portfolio. It should charge the market premium for the world equity market portfolio. We
defer to Section 4 the issue of the currency of measurement.
Table 3 shows the calculation of the required premium (or required excess
expected rate of return) in dollar units on the French firm Thalès from the point of view
of worldwide stockholders for the hypothetical, full-integration situation in which they
hold a worldwide, diversified portfolio of equity. This required premium is to be added to
the current value of the riskless USD rate of interest, to obtain a required rate of return in
USD. The risk premium obtained using this method is quite different from those reported
in Tables 1 and 2 using the segmented-market model. So the valuation of a project would
change markedly depending on which model applied.

The reader might think that currency risk is absent from the analysis, but this is
not true. If the beta of Thalès were measured after being hedged for exchange risk, the
result would be somewhat different from Table 3. To demonstrate this we first calculate
the beta of a bank deposit denominated in Euros against the world market portfolio. The
result is reported in Table 4. Observe that this foreign-currency deposit, as is typical for

13

major currencies, has a low β vis-à-vis the world market and consequently, a low
required excess rate of return.

If Thalès obeys the “worldwide, classic CAPM” and if a currency deposit
denominated in Euros obeys the “worldwide, classic CAPM”, a combination of these two
assets must do so as well. A share of Thalès hedged against the currency risk of the Euro
is one such combination. From the USD point of view, the exposure elasticity of a Thalès
share to the Euro is 0.391. This estimate can be ascertained by running a regression of the
USD excess rate of return on Thalès on the USD excess rate of return on a deposit
denominated in Euros. The slope coefficient is the exposure elasticity . This means that
one percent increase in the USD price of a euro results in a 0.391% increase in the price
of a share of Thalès. So to hedge the Thalès share from currency risk, one would need to
go short a euro deposit (borrow euro) in an amount equal to 39.1% of the Thalès
investment. Thus, one dollar invested in shares of Thalès hedged is one dollar invested in
a unhedged share of Thalès accompanied by an Euro borrowing equal to 39.1 US cents.
The net excess rate of return from this combination is equal to the excess rate of return on
Thalès minus 0.391 times the excess rate of return on a deposit (loan) denominated in
Euros. That net excess rate of return has a expected level required in the world financial
market which is equal to the required excess rate of return on Thalès (0.232%; see Table
14

3) minus 0.391 times the required excess rate of return on a deposit denominated in Euros
(0.012%; see Table 4). The result is equal to 0.228%.10

2.3. Testing integration and the classic CAPM
A person using the “worldwide classic CAPM” may want to know whether this
model is compatible with actual rate of return observations in the financial market. It is
difficult to produce a definitive answer to this question. If the dataset includes only
returns on the equity portfolios of various countries, a typical cross-sectional picture,
shown here as Figure 2, is not conclusive. However, if the dataset includes foreigncurrency denominated deposits in addition to equity portfolios , a picture such as Figure
3 emerges. A slightly distinct cross-sectional line seems to appear within the cloud of
points. 11

10

Another way to obtain the same result is to calculate the β of Thalès hedged. It is equal to the β of
Thalès before hedging (0.870; see Table 3) minus 0.391 times the β of a currency deposit denominated in
Euros (0.046; see Table 4). The result is 0.853. This value of β times the world premium (0.267% per
month) is equal to 0.228%.
11
Modern tests of the CAPM would not be performed simply by taking a line through the cloud of points of
Figure 2 or 3. Doing so assumes that the CAPM line one is trying to estimate never moves and that the
position of each security on the line never changes. Modern tests would utilize variables (called “indicator
variables”, “instrumental variables” or “information variables”) that track these movements. A CAPM with
moving parts is called a “conditional CAPM”. See Harvey (1991) for an application to world data. When
currencies are included in the dataset, the classic CAPM tends to be rejected by statistical tests, in favor of
the more sophisticated models we are about to explore.

3. Multi-β CAPM
Figure 2 represents an approximate test of the classic CAPM under the hypothesis
of full market integration. A rejection signal from the statistical test can mean that the
classic CAPM is incorrect and/or that the world financial market is not integrated. Since
the test is unlikely to be conclusive on either count, we need to remain agnostic on the
question of knowing whether we should use a country risk premium (as is the case under
full segmentation) or, instead, a world risk premium (under full integration). Driven by
the desire to remain agnostic and by the belief that the world financial market is probably
neither fully integrated nor fully segmented, one might be tempted to use a CAPM
including both kinds of premiums, determined on the basis of distinct βs and different
prices of risk for each dimension of risk. This leads to the idea of a multi-β or “hybrid”
CAPM.

3.1. A “hybrid”, multifactor CAPM
In a multi-factor, or multi-beta model, the measurement of risk is not onedimensional. Instead, there exist several dimensions to which an investor is sensitive
simultaneously. For instance, we mentioned above that a mean-variance investor should
only care about the security's sensitivities (exposure) to its portfolio return. At the market
level this implies that the market requires a premium only for a security's exposure to the
return on the market portfolio.
But when investors care only about the mean and variance of their return, it
means that they do not care when they receive a high return and when they receive a low

17

return. That may not be a realistic assumption. People may be interested in getting high
returns from their worldwide, diversified portfolio when their own country is in a
recession and are ready to accept lower returns from their portfolio when their own
country is in expansion. This may be because they collect some other income (such as
wages) intrinsically tied to the economic activity in their own country.12 Under these
circumstances, they may want to look carefully at their portfolio's exposure to their own
country, probably reducing the weight of their country's shares in order to diversify away
from their other income. Alternatively, consider a different case in which investors may
have a special liking for the shares of their own country's firms because they feel better
informed about them.
Whatever may be the reason for it, it can happen that the financial market prices a
portfolio or a security's exposure to countries differently from the way it prices exposure
to the world financial market as a whole.
In order to implement a model of this sort, one must generalize the concept of β as
a one-dimensional exposure to risk, to reach a concept of multidimensional exposure.
This is easily done by using the tool of multiple regression. The following equation is an
example of a multifactor model where the two “factors” are world rate of return risk, as
in the integrated version of the classic CAPM, and country rate of return risk as in the
segmented version of the classic CAPM. . Accordingly, it relates the excess rate of return
of the equity of firm i in country c, Ri –r, to the excess rate of return on the world market
portfolio, Rw –r, and the excess rate of return on the country market portfolio, Rc –r:
Ri − r = α i / c ,w + βˆi / w × (Rw − r ) + βˆ i / c × (Rc − r ) + ε i / c ,w

(3)

12

Non financial wealth can also be broadly seen as the underpinning of the well-accepted multifactor
CAPM of Fama and French (1996).

18

In the above, we have placed a ^ on the exposure coefficients to highlight the fact that
they are not equal to the β coefficients that we have considered in the previous
subsection. Those were coefficients in a simple regression. The coefficients in (3) are
calculated jointly by the procedure of multiple regression applied to the time series (i.e.,
history) of past returns.
What we have just explained is a multifactor statistical model that simply captures
the way in which random ex post returns relate to each other. A decomposition such as
(3) can always be achieved. It is only a matter of getting the computer to calculate the β
coefficients. This has no economic content. It does not tell us, for instance, what mean
rates of return on securities should be, so that investors would be willing to hold them.
The multifactor pricing model, however, gives us specifically that answer. It says
that the expected rate of return of each security should be linearly related to the security's
multiple exposures to the various dimensions of risk:
E [Ri − r ] = βˆi / w × E [Rw − r ] + βˆi / c × E [Rc − r ]

(4)

E[Rc - r] – expected value of the excess return on the world stock market -- and E[Rw - r]
– expected value of the excess return on the country’s stock market -- are the risk
premiums per unit of exposure risk, charged by the market to bear the systematic risks
inherent in the local market portfolio, Rc – r, and the world market portfolio, Rw - r
respectively. The total risk premium required of any security i is the sum of two
premiums: one for country risk equal to security i's exposure to country risk times the
premium per unit of country risk, and one for world market risk equal to security i's
exposure to world risk times the premium per unit of world risk. Again, the exposures to

19

the two risks are partial, or joint, exposures (also called “loadings”) calculated by a
multiple regression.
Let us illustrate on our example of Thalès how the “hybrid” model would
incorporate the two factors. The betas for the two-factor model are reported in Table 5.
The influence of the French market is evidently the dominant one, since the beta for the
world market is not even positive. Modifying the French-only model of Table 2 with the
addition of a world market return as in Table 5 seems to make little difference. Thalès
appears to be priced primarily with respect to the French market.

To gain some perspective on whether this phenomenon is a general one, we
produce Tables 6, 7, 8 and 9. These tables display the values of the joint β̂ s calculated

on an arbitrary sample of firms of an arbitrary subset of countries: the United States,
Belgium, France and Poland. Each table gives us, for each firm, the two joint β̂ s
obtained by regressing the firms’ excess rates of return on the local and the world stock
markets.13 In these tables, the excess rates of return are measured in the local currency

13

Admittedly, some of the firms in our list are part of the local country stock index. That fact undermines a
straight comparison of the sizes of the local and the word betas. Even when a firm is part of the local, the
betas we have calculated remain those that are relevant for CAPM application. Their relative sizes explain

20

but the exposure β̂ numbers would be roughly similar if the rates of return had been
measured in some other currency.14

For all countries, it is clear that the joint β̂ vis-à-vis the local market is much
larger than the joint β̂ vis-à-vis the world market and that local-country risk premium
dominates the pricing. This is a striking empirical fact, although it is a difficult one to
understand in theoretical terms. Unless the world is segmented generally – and not just
financially -- why should local stock indexes have such a dominant influence on stocks in
that country?
The CAPM by itself does not dictate what βs should be; it only indicates how
expected returns should differ from one security to another given the structure of βs.
However, βs come from somewhere; they are calculated from rates of return. In a broader
dynamic-pricing theory, prices – not just expected returns -- would be entirely calculated

24

from the fundamental cash flows paid by the security under consideration.15 In the
context of such a theory, under the hypothesis of full integration, common stochastic
discount factors are applied to all securities of the world. As these discount factors
fluctuate, so do the prices of all securities. The theory is likely to tell us that securities are
more exposed to the world market index than to country market index, contrary to what
we observed above in Tables 6-9.
The fact that βs do not seem to reflect very well the degree of international
involvement of firms was pointed out in an early paper by Jacquillat and Solnik (1978).
They focused on a set of U.S. multinationals and showed that their price movements are
markedly related to those of the NYSE, while they are poorly related to the stock indexes
of the countries where the multinationals are active.16
What we have observed in Tables 6-9 is also reminiscent of the phenomenon of
“local pricing” whereby, for unknown reasons, the securities traded on one stock
exchange seem to follow the gyrations of that stock exchange index. Consider an unusual
example discussed in Froot and Dabora (1999), the pricing of the shares of Royal Dutch
Shell. Since 1909, the sister companies of the Royal Dutch Shell group have shared all
dividends. Yet the stocks of the British company, Shell Trading and Transport, and the
Dutch company, Royal Dutch Shell, have often fetched different prices (when expressed
in the same currency). And, even more interestingly, the ratio of these prices follows the
ratio of the stock price indexes in London and Amsterdam. In other words, the local
15

For one such theory applied to the international context, see Dumas, Harvey, Ruiz (2000).
A recent paper by Diermeir and Solnik (2001) provides intriguing evidence about the relative influence
of domestic and foreign markets. They develop a domestic stock index consisting of firms that are
primarily exposed to the domestic economy only. They then find that the domestic index has a much
smaller influence on firms in that market than does an index consisting of rest-of-world stocks. More
research is needed to reconcile their results with earlier work by Jacquillat and Solnik (1978) and others
similar to that of Tables 6-9 showing the predominance of home country influences on stock prices.
16

25

stock market influence seems to pertain even for sister companies sharing the same
dividends.
Another example of local market pricing concerns closed-end country funds.
These funds, which typically invest in the stocks of a single foreign country, are offered
to investors in the American market as a convenient way to buy a diversified portfolio of
the foreign country’s stocks. When the prices of these closed end funds are compared
with the net asset value (NAV) of the underlying stocks, large differentials are often
discovered. This by itself is not surprising, since these differentials cannot be “arbitraged
away” unless the fund is forced to liquidate its holdings. But what is strange about the
differentials is that they are correlated with the American market.17 Why should the
differential between closed end fund prices and their NAV be correlated with the home
market of the investors in the fund? The U.S. market exerts an influence on closed end
fund prices even though the stocks in the fund are overseas.
We may have done well to have remained agnostic and, by applying the “hybrid”
model, to have left open the possibility that the world financial market may, at least
partially, be segmented. As is the case for many multi-factor CAPMs, it is not easy to
produce a rigorous theoretical foundation for the hybrid CAPM. This model is a strange
mix of the full-integration and the full-segmentation CAPMs. An intermediate situation
of partial segmentation may not lead to anything resembling the hybrid CAPM. In fact, it
is not easy to define a situation of partial segmentation in the first place. Partial
segmentation is a configuration in which each individual investor has access to an
incomplete but well-specified list of securities. Just specifying the situation in the first

Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler (1991) provide evidence regarding such pricing.

place requires information of I×N dimension, where I is the number of individuals and N
is the total number of existing securities!18

4. The pricing of currency risk
The world CAPM that have discussed in Section 2 was implicitly based on an
important assumption – that every investor has the same currency. When we applied the
CAPM in question to rates of return measured, for instance, in US$, we were implicitly
assuming that all investors of the world were choosing their portfolios on the basis of
anticipated US$ returns, or that all investors were US$ based investors, presumably living
and consuming the income from their portfolio in the United States. In reality, the world
is populated with investors who live in different countries. This creates among them a
degree of heterogeneity that has not been taken into account. When that heterogeneity is
taken into account, we have a picture of the world financial investor population that is
described in Figure 1.

4.1. Description of the IAPM
We shall now show that, when the world investor population is heterogeneous in
this manner, foreign exchange risk cannot be priced the same way as world market risk.
The reason for this difference is the following. As far as world equity risk is concerned,
every investor in the world basically holds a long position. Firms issue stock securities to
finance their investment and most everyone buys those securities. The cases in which
some investors short stocks only arise from a difference of opinion about the anticipated
returns of stocks; in that case, even more investors dollar-wise hold the same stocks long.
In order to reap the benefits of diversification, investors of the world hold
positively the stock securities of all countries. All these stock securities – but especially
the foreign stocks -- expose the investors to equity risk but also to currency risk. This last
risk may or may not be worth bearing depending on the equilibrium rates of return in the
market for currency deposits, to which we turn in the next paragraph. If it so happens that
the currency risk imbedded in foreign stock securities is not worth bearing (which means
that the cost of hedging is sufficiently low), investors who invest into foreign stocks will
want to hedge this investment against currency risk.
In the market for currencies, the situation is vastly different. Investors who reside
in one country consider the deposit denominated in their home currency to be a riskless
or quasi-riskless asset, since it guarantees a future purchasing power. Even if inflation in
their country is very volatile, the home currency deposit will often be the safest asset
available.19

19

Case situations in which residents of one country regard a foreign-currency deposit as less risky than the
home currency fall outside the theory that we are trying to develop.

28

Provided their risk aversions are sufficiently high,20 the investors of each country
hold the home-currency deposit positively. They stand ready to hold it because they want
to invest some of their wealth in what they view as a riskless asset. This is just an
application of the familiar Tobin separation theorem, whereby investors choose the
composition of a portfolio of risky securities and then, depending on their level of risk
aversion, decide what fraction of their wealth to invest in the riskless and what fraction in
the portfolio of risky securities. By holding the home-currency deposit, home investors
maintain the home-currency rate of interest at a level lower than it would otherwise be.
Foreign investors who are holding stocks of the country, in contrast, are candidates for
hedging. They may wish to borrow the home currency, or, equivalently, sell it forward or
generally hold it short. They will do so if the cost of hedging is sufficiently low. But a
low cost of hedging is precisely what home-country resident investors tend to bring about
since their situation induces them to hold the currency. The equilibrium that obtains is
one in which foreign investors short the home currency, taking advantage of the vast pool
of home residents who, by holding their home currency, stand ready to provide hedging
services, at a cost which is lower than it would be in their absence.
In this equilibrium, stock market risk is priced by investors who are all basically
holding that risk long, while each of the currency risk dimensions is priced by investors
some of whom structurally hold it long while others short it. Because of this structural
difference, the equilibrium pricing of currency risk cannot be subsumed in the pricing of
world stock market risk. It cannot be a redundant dimension of risk. To price it, we need

20

See Adler and Dumas (1983).

29

a separate risk premium, with a price of risk that is determined separately from the price
of world stock market risk. The result is the International Asset Pricing Model (IAPM):21
E [Ri − r ] = βˆ i / w × E [Rw − r ] + βˆ i / S × E [RS − r ]

(6)

where βˆi / w and βˆi / S are the coefficients of a multiple regression of the rate of return of
security i on the world market portfolio rate of return and on the rates of return of nonmeasurement currency deposits, all measured in some measurement currency, and where
E [RS − r ] is the expected excess rate of return on a non-measurement currency, also

measured in the measurement currency. Currency risk is priced by the average excess
returns on currencies. βˆi / S can be interpreted as the “exposures” of security i to currency
risks.22

4.2. IAPM applied to Thalès
In Table 10, we illustrate the working of the IAPM on the Thalès example. Since
the equity return on Thalès is measured in dollars, the table reports joint betas with
respect to both the world stock market and the Euro deposit (representing the foreign
currency risk factor). Adding the resulting risk premium to the dollar rate of interest
gives the dollar required rate of return on Thalès in a world market in which the investor
population is heterogeneous.

21

See Solnik (1974).
The sources of the exposures to currency risks are analyzed in Bodnar, Dumas and Marston (2002). Key
parameters are the firm’s market share abroad, the product’s elasticity of substitution with foreign products
and the fraction of inputs imported from abroad, all captured in some cases simply by the fractions of
revenues and costs originating from abroad and the rate of profit (see Bodnar and Marston (2001)).

In Table 11, we perform the same task on the same Thalès but using the Euro as
the measurement currency. This table indicates the required risk premium in Euro units.
This is the same required excess rate of return as in Table 9, only translated into Euros.
Adding it to the Euro rate of interest would give the Euro required rate of return on
Thalès.
Note the way in which exposures are translated from one currency to the other.
The exposure to the world remains unchanged at 0.856. The exposure to the currency, 0.159 is the result of the following formula: -0.159 = 1 – (0.856 – 0.303). This formula is
exact, and can be demonstrated by calculus, for returns calculated on extremely short
holding periods. When changing currency units, the currency exposure calculated from
the point of view of the new currency is equal to 1 minus the sum of the exposures
measured in the old currency.23

23

The proof of this result is based on a simple approximation, which is exact in the limit as the length of
the holding period becomes extremely small. Start with the statistical exposure relationship written in $
units:
Ri$ − r $ = βˆ i / w × [R w$ − r $ ] + βˆ i / S × [R S$ − r $ ] + ε i / w , S

We want to turn this relationship into one where returns are measured into Euros. An excellent
approximation to Ri€ − r € is Ri$ − r $ − RS$ − r $ . Let us calculate that quantity. First, we subtract [R S$ − r $ ]
from both sides of the equation:

[

(

]

)

Ri$ − r $ − [RS$ − r $ ] = βˆ i / w × [Rw$ − r $ ] + βˆ i / S − 1 × [RS$ − r $ ] + ε i / w, S

Finally, in Table 12, we compute the required excess rate of return on Thalès
according to the IAPM, but after hedging. To hedge Thalès shares, it is necessary to
determine the “exposure” of Thalès to the Euro by which we mean the sensitivity of
Thalès’ share price to movements in the Euro. From the USD point of view, the simple
exposure of a Thalès share to the Euro is equal to 0.391. One dollar invested in shares of
Thalès hedged is one dollar invested in a share of Thalès accompanied by an amount of
Euro borrowing equal to 39.1 US cents.24

But then we also want to express the world equity premium in Euro units. An excellent approximation to
R w€ − r € is R w$ − r $ − [R S$ − r $ ] :

(

)

Ri$ − r $ − [RS$ − r $ ] = βˆi / w × {[Rw$ − r $ ] − [RS$ − r $ ]}+ βˆi / S + βˆi / w − 1 × [RS$ − r $ ] + ε i / w , S

Finally, from the Euro point of view, we wish to show on the right-hand side, not the excess dollar rate of
return on a Euro deposit but the excess Euro rate of return on a dollar deposit. To the same degree of
approximation, they are equal and opposite to each other. Hence we get, as claimed:
Ri€ − r € = βˆi / w × [Rw€ − r € ] + 1 − βˆi / S − βˆi / w × [RS€ − r € ] + ε i / w, S
24
Trivially, a Euro deposit, from the dollar point of view, has a zero joint exposure to the world market and
a 100% exposure to itself. Hence, after hedging, the joint exposure of Thalès to the world market remains at
0.856, where it was before hedging, and the joint exposure to the Euro is equal to: -0.303 – 1×0.391 = 0.089.

The reader might wonder why Thalès in Table 12, after hedging, still has a non
zero joint exposure, -0.089, to the currency. The reason is that the table displays the joint
coefficients of a multiple regression of Thalès hedged on the world market unhedged and
on the currency. Hence, the coefficient –0.089 reflects the exposure of the world market
to the currency.25
In Table 13, we show another way to use the International Asset Pricing Model.
The coefficient of a regression of the return on a hedged share of Thalès on the hedged
world market portfolio is equal to 0.856. And the exposure to the currency is then
reduced to zero. When all returns are hedged against currency risk, the IAPM reduced to
a single-factor model.

25

In fact, it is equal to minus 0.856 times the simple exposure of the world market to the currency, which,
by a simple regression, would be found to be 0.104.

All the CAPMs we have discussed prior to this section have one major weakness
in common. If the CAPM in question applies to the rates of return measured in one
currency, then the same CAPM will no longer hold after translation into another
currency. If all securities lined up when their returns are measured in one unit, they no
longer will when measured in another unit. This deficiency is shared by any CAPM that
does not include a separate term for a currency risk premium. The International Asset
Pricing Model enjoys a property of consistency under a change of measurement unit.
One can show that the choice of the measurement currency, in terms of which the IAPM
is stated, is immaterial.27
The IAPM is not without drawback, however. One drawback of the IAPM is that
the list of non-measurement currency dimensions of risk to which security i may be
exposed is potentially very long. Moreover, premiums for these currency risk are often
much smaller than world market risk premiums28 and the calculation of the currency risk

26

The world hedged expected excess rate of return is equal to the expected excess rate of return on the
world before hedging minus the exposure of the world market times the cost of hedging: 0.271% = -0.267%
- 0.104×(-0.038%).
27
See Sercu (1980).
28
Nonetheless, Dumas and Solnik (1995) are able to show empirically, in a conditional version of the
IAPM, that these premiums are statistically significant. Furthermore, while they may appear small when an
average over many months is calculated, they fluctuate a great deal from month to month and may not be
small at all, in any given month. That is the reason for which their statistical significance can be

34

is based on a price of risk that is estimated with a wide margin of error. This is because it
is based on the average excess rate of return on just one asset, namely, the average excess
rate of return on each of the foreign currencies considered one by one. This is in contrast
to the price of world market risk, which is based on the average excess rate of return on
the wide world market portfolio. By a statistical analog of the diversification effect, the
average excess rate of return on a wide portfolio is a much better estimate of the
corresponding expected excess return than would be the average return on a single asset.
Nonetheless, the required risk premium on a security, incorporating the sum of all
premia, is likely to be estimated more reliably than is each individual term of the multifactor CAPM. Errors on average currency movements that are contained in the world
market premium are largely offset by errors on the average currency movements
contained in the currency premiums themselves. In fact, when the IAPM is applied to
rates of return after hedging, as in Table 12, average currency movements no longer play
any role at all. This is a comforting aspect of that particular formulation of the
International Asset Pricing Model.

5. The pricing of political risk
As far as financial-market pricing is concerned, there is a strong similarity
between currency risk and political risk. Both are borne differentially by the residents and
the non residents of a country. For similar reasons, therefore, it may be a good idea to
recognize a separate risk premiums for political risks. This again leads to a multi-β

demonstrated only in a conditional version of the IAPM, in which a number of indicator variables are used
to track these movements.

35

CAPM in which we would recognize a premium for world, or country, market risk and
one or several premiums for political risk.29
But what index can properly represent the political risk factor? Abuaf (1997)
proposes to treat political risk by including foreign, sovereign bonds or Brady bonds in
the multiple regression for the estimation of joint βs and, correspondingly, to estimate the
market price of political risk. There are both empirical and conceptual problems with this
approach. The empirical problem is that, for the last fifteen years, the Brady bonds of
some countries have had negative returns (as will be seen below). The conceptual
problem is that Brady bonds may not capture political risk properly. For one thing, they
are partly backed by U.S. Treasury bills. More crucially, the risk that a government will
not repay may differ from the risk that a company of the country will see its stock return
affected by political factors.
To illustrate the empirical problem with using Abuaf’s approach, we apply his
methodology to a sample of Latin American firms in Table 14. We calculate the required
risk premium on a number of ADRs which are written on Latin American stock securities
and which are traded on the NYSE. This is done on the basis of the excess dollar rate of
return on the corresponding Brady bonds of the respective Latin American country.30

29

For clarity of exposition, we consider each type of risk premium separately and discuss it in separate
sections but they can obviously be combined, provided that care is taken to estimate the βs in a joint
multiple regression.
30
To clarify the calculation, the required excess rate of return on “BBVA BANCO FRANCES SPN. ADR.”, 11.76%, is equal to: 0.812×0.32% + 0.948×(-12.68%).

The results in this table are not satisfactory because, during the sample period
under consideration, the average realized excess dollar rate of return on the Brady bonds
turned out to be negative or in several cases implausibly small. It is unlikely that

38

negative risk premiums or small positive risk premiums reflect the rates of return that
investors expected and required on these securities. And the relative ranking of countries
appears to be wrong. Surely the ex ante excess return on Argentina (which had defaulted
twice since the early 1980s even prior to its recent default) would be larger than the
excess return on Mexico (which had avoided defaults since the early 1980s and has
recently been upgraded to investment grade).
We might obtain more sensible estimates of the political risk factor if we replaced
the realized returns on Brady bonds by an estimate of the ex ante excess returns that
investors expected. In Table 14, the excess return on Mexican Brady bonds is 4.33%.
This is similar to the 4 % excess return on high yield bonds in the U.S. from 1984 to
2001. If we use 4 % as a lower bound on the ex ante excess return on Brady bonds, we
can obtain estimates of the political risk premiums for each firm in Table 14 by applying
the betas reported in that table. Although these numbers would be conditional on the 4%
figure and therefore must be treated as illustrative only, they do indicate that political risk
factors are potentially quite large.
How might these estimates be refined? We need to take into account differences
across countries in the political risk premium rather than use a 4 % figure for all
countries. Several avenues might be explored. First, we could consult yield spreads on
Brady bonds. The spreads themselves provide upward biased estimates of the excess
return on Brady bonds because the spreads reflect the probability of default as well as the
risk premium on the bonds. But the spreads might indicate the relative rankings of the
country premiums. The same can be said of ratings of Brady bonds by services such as

39

Moody’s.31 Third, we could use models of country risk based on objective indicators.
J.P. Morgan has a model for determining sovereign spreads based on a “scoring system”
for both external and internal “country risk factors”. External factors include exchange
rate, current account/GDP ratio, external debt/GDP ratio, debt service as percent of
foreign-exchange reserves, and interest services as percent of exports. Domestic factors
include change in growth rate of GDP, inflation rate, growth or fiscal deficit as percent of
GDP, real bank credit growth as percent of GDP. It’s not clear how successful these
factors would be in explaining political risk, but they could also help us to rank countries
vis-à-vis one another.
All of these approaches suggest the relative ranking of countries in terms of
political risk, but none give us a quantitative measure of the ex ante risk premium.
Clearly there is much work to be done in estimating political risk premiums.

6. Transposing required rates of return from one
country to another
In many situations encountered in practice, the exposure measurements that are required
for the application of the various CAPMs are not possible. For instance, a U.S.
automobile manufacturer wants to build a plant in Brazil. It is not possible to obtain
directly the βs of the project. The usual escape is to find a firm operating in Brazil that
would be comparable to the project. But there may not exist such a firm. It is then
necessary to measure stock-return relationships in one country (for instance, the U.S.),
and then transpose them to another country (Brazil). This guesswork can be aided by a
number of approximation methods, each one suggested by the form of a CAPM.
31

Pricing of political risk in Mexico is explored in Adler and Qi (2003).

40

6.1. The hierarchical statistical model: an approximate way
to obtain a security’s β vis-à-vis the world
Consider the excess rate of return, Ri – r, of a firm i. Let us assume for the purposes of
this model, that it is possible to say that firm i "belongs" to country c. The operational
meaning of that assumption will be apparent shortly.
In an attempt to represent the way in which the returns on the various firms co-vary with
each other within a country, we first relate the excess rate of return of firm i to the excess
rate of return on the stock market of the country:
Ri − r = α i / c + β i / c × (Rc − r ) + ε i / c

(7)

Recall that, the way a regression such as this is computed, the residual εi/c is (linearly)
independent of the regressor (Rc − r ) . That means that εi/c is purely specific to the firm
against the background of a common country movement.
Then, in an attempt to represent the way in which the various countries co-vary with each
other, we relate the country's excess rate of return to the excess rate of return on the world
stock market:
Rc − r = α c / w + β c / w × (Rw − r ) + ε c / w

(8)

In this regression again, the residual εc/w is (linearly) independent of the regressor

(Rw − r ) .
Now substitute Equation (8) into Equation (7):
Ri − r = α i / c + β i / c × [α c / w + β c / w × (Rw − r ) + ε c / w ] + ε i / c
Ri − r = (α i / c + β i / c × α c / w ) + β i / c × β c / w × (Rw − r ) + (β i / c × ε c / w + ε i / c )

41

In that new relationship, the intercept term is (α i / c + β i / c × α c / w ) , the slope coefficient of
firm i against the world is equal to β i / c × β c / w , or the product of the firm's β against its
country by the country's β against the world. The new residual is equal to:

(β i / c × ε c / w + ε i / c ) . Notice, however, that there is nothing to guarantee that this new
residual is linearly independent of the regressor, since εi/c has not been constructed to be
independent of (Rw − r ) . For this reason and this reason alone, the above relationship
would differ from the relationship one would obtain by relating directly the excess return
of firm i to the world index as in:
Ri − r = α i / w + β i / w × (Rc − r ) + ε i / w

We are saying that generally:

βi / w ≠ βi /c × βc/ w
because it is generally not true that εi/c is independent of (Rw − r ) .
What would it mean in practical terms for εi/c to be independent of (Rw − r ) ? It would
mean that, when firm i's return has been broken down as in Equation (7), the firm's
excess rate of return Ri − r is related to the world market only via the country return

(Rc − r ) . There would exist no separate relationship between the firm-specific return
(calculated relative to the country) and the world. The relationship between the firm and
the world would be channeled “hierarchically” through the country effect only.
This seems a very unlikely occurrence given that firm i presumably belongs to some
industry and there exist common worldwide industry movements, which are not fully
captured solely by country factors.

42

To illustrate the nature of the approximation, multiply Thalès’ exposure to the French
market risk (equal to 1.065; see Table 2) by the exposure of the French market to the
world market (found to be equal to 0.975):
1.065×0.975 = 1.0389
which differs from the full, direct exposure of Thalès to the world market, equal to 0.870
(see Table 3).
In the case of Thalès, there would be no point in settling for such an approximate number.
If we need its β because we intend to utilize the world classic CAPM, we can measure it
directly. The approximate procedure can become valuable, however, when attempting to
price an asset that is not yet traded and for which no comparable firm exists. In the
example of the U.S. automobile plant in Brazil, we could go through the following steps:
•

The β of the Brazilian plant vis-à-vis the world is approximately equal to the β of
the Brazilian plant vis-à-vis the Brazilian stock market multiplied by the β of the
Brazilian stock market vis-à-vis the world.

•

The second term of that product can be calculated directly.

•

The first term cannot be calculated since the Brazilian plan is not traded in the
financial market. But we can assume further that the β of the Brazilian plant vis-àvis the Brazilian stock market is similar in magnitude to the β of any automobile
plant vis-à-vis the country stock market measured in another country. So, perhaps
the β of GM vis-à-vis the U.S. stock market can be used instead.32

32

Needless to say, if leverage differs, a leverage adjustment must be performed.

43

How good an approximation is provided by this procedure?33 Tables 15 to 18 attempt to
address this issue. It compares the direct and the approximate βs of a number of firms in
four countries: France, the U.S., Belgium and Poland. Poland is the only country out of
the four where the approximation is very bad. Does that mean that there is a tendency for
the approximation to not work well in countries whose capital market is not well
integrated with the rest of the world. That would be bad news as developing capital
markets may be the ones for which we need this approximation most often.

6.2. Implications of the hybrid CAPM
We have repeatedly used the example of Thalès, a French company. Could we try
to guess what the stock market return on Thalès would have to be, if Thalès, instead of
being a company operating in France, were a company operating in the U.S.?
The model recognizing a world and a country factor may be helpful in this
respect. In Table 19, we have constructed the premium on the actual French Thalès in

45

Euros. This table is analogous to Table 5 above but, unlike Table 5, measurements have
been done in Euros directly from the original data.34
If we try to imagine what the exposure coefficients would have been if Thalès
were a U.S. company, one might venture the hypothesis that the coefficients (factor
loadings) would be identical to what they are for the actual French company, except that
the loading that falls on the French stock market factor would now fall on the U.S. stock
market factor. In addition,35 one might prefer to think that the coefficients, applying to
USD returns, would be identical to what they are for the actual French company’s Euro
returns.
This idea is implemented in Table 20 where the unit of measurement is the dollar.
Table 20 also contains the calculation of risk premiums for an actual U.S. company
engaged, like Thalès in the manufacturing of electrical equipment, namely General
Electric. The similarity of the two firms’ cost of equity capital and exposure coefficients
is intriguing.

34

Unlike the International Asset Pricing Model, the hybrid model, if it does not contain any premium for
currency factors, is not amenable to direct translation of the terms of the equation. A change of unit
requires that one go back and re-measure returns in the new currency.
35
But this is not intrinsic to this model, which does not emphasize currency differences.

The transposition that we have performed is quite naïve. Thalès presumably has
some activities in the U.S. and General Electric in the European Union. Furthermore,
General Electric, and perhaps also Thalès, have other activities than the manufacturing of
electrical equipment. It might be possible, along the lines of Diermeier and Solnik (2001)

47

to make use of information on the firm’s activities in order to refine the transposition
procedure.

6.3. Implications of the International Asset Pricing Model
There exists a third method of transposing returns from one country to another. It
is based on the International Asset Pricing Model, in which, as we saw, currency risk
plays center-stage.
Let us try to answer in this context the same question we asked in Subsection 6.2.
Could we try to guess what the stock market return on Thalès would have to be, if Thalès,
instead of being a company operating in France, were a company operating in the U.S.?
In Table 11, we calculated the required excess rate of return of Thalès in Euros.
This required rate of return reflected Thalès’ exposures to the world market and to the
dollar denominated deposit excess return, both measured in Euros. If Thalès had been a
company operating in the U.S., one might surmise that its exposures, measured in
dollars, would have been similar to what they are, when measured in Euros, for the actual

Thalès operating in France. This, of course, is pure guesswork but it makes some sense if
the U.S. version of Thalès conducts business vis-à-vis the rest of the world in a way that
is similar to the actual Thalès, the only difference being that it conducts it from a home
base functional currency that is the U.S. dollar, instead of being the Euro. In actuality, of
course, many other aspects of business in the U.S. may differ from business in Europe.
Presuming that the reader is willing to humor us in our flight of fancy, we show in
Table 21 our calculation of the rate of return on the fictional U.S. version of Thalès. To
illustrate the verisimilitude of our fictional story, Table 21 also contains a similar
calculation for General Electric, an actual U.S. company engaged, like Thalès, in the

48

manufacturing of electrical equipment. The similarity of the exposures of the two
companies – the fictional Thalès and the actual G.E. – is uncanny, although it may just be
a coincidence.

This exercise illustrates how the IAPM operates a neat separation between
currency risk and “business risk”. Transposing from one country to another, leaving the
exposures unchanged, only involves translating the risk premiums. Once risk premiums

49

have been obtained, the only remaining task needed to obtain required rates of return is
the replacement of one rate of interest with another.
The two approaches to evaluating Thalès’ risk premium, using the hybrid model
and the IAPM, give us intriguing results. In both cases, the risk premiums estimated for
Thalès are remarkably similar to those of General Electric. But another feature of the
results is important. The hybrid model leads to a much higher risk premium for Thalès
(0.773 %/month) than does the IAPM (0.235 %). So we have not resolved the problem
of choosing the “right model” for pricing a firm internationally. What the examples
suggest is that the cost of capital for a French firm like Thalès may not be that different
from that of an American firm like G.E. – as long as a similar model of pricing is used
and the conditions under which the firm operates are taken into account. But the
examples leave unresolved the issue of which model is right.

7. Conclusion
The main issue in determining the cost of equity capital on a venture
internationally is the degree of integration of the world financial markets. If it is believed
that some segmentation prevails along national borders, a home β and a home equity
premium is to be used. If it is believed that integration prevails, a world β and a world
equity premium is to be used. One way perhaps to remain agnostic on the issue is to use a
hybrid CAPM containing several risk premiums for home and world risks.
The general approach that we have tried to illustrate relies on an identification and
separation of individual dimensions of risk: home vs. world stock market risk, industry
risk (not discussed here), currency risk and political risk. It is not enough to identify each
dimension of risk. The price of each one must also be readable by watching the

50

tickertape. Dimensions of risk must be recognized in such a way that there exist traded
securities capable of indicating to us the price of each dimension. In some cases, some
audacious transposition must be performed so that a particular venture can be priced,
even if only approximately.
