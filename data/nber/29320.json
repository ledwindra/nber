    "abstract": "\n\nPost-war growth in agricultural productivity outpaced the US non-farm economy, spurred by steadily increasing crop yields. We argue that rising atmospheric CO\u2082 is responsible for a significant share of these yield gains. We present a novel methodology to estimate the CO\u2082 fertilization effect using data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. Our study complements the many field experiments by regressing county yields on local CO\u2082 levels across the majority of US cropland under actual growing conditions. For identification, we utilize year-to-year anomalies from county-specific trends, an instrument for those CO\u2082 anomalies using wind patterns, and a spatial first-differences approach. We consistently find a large CO\u2082 fertilization effect: a 1 ppm increase in CO\u2082 equates to a 0.4%, 0.6%, 1% yield increase for corn, soybeans, and wheat, respectively. In a thought exercise, we apply the CO\u2082 fertilization effect we estimated in our sample from 2015-2021 backwards to 1940, and, assuming no other limiting factors, find that CO\u2082 was the dominant driver of yield growth\u2014with implications for estimates of future climate change damages.\n\n",
