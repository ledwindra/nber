Has the U.S. Wage Phillips Curve Flattened? A Semi-Structural Exploration
Jordi Galí and Luca Gambetti
NBER Working Paper No. 25476
January 2019
JEL No. E24,E31
ABSTRACT
Unconditional reduced form estimates of a conventional wage Phillips curve for the U.S.
economy point to a decline in its slope coefficient in recent years, as well as a shrinking role of
lagged price inflation in the determination of wage inflation. We provide estimates of a
conditional wage Phillips curve, based on a structural decomposition of wage, price and
unemployment data generated by a VAR with time varying coefficients, identified by a
combination of long-run and sign restrictions. Our estimates show that the key qualitative
findings from the unconditional reduced form regressions also emerge in the conditional
evidence, suggesting that they are not entirely driven by endogeneity problems or possible
changes over time in the importance of of wage markup shocks. The conditional evidence,
however, suggests that actual changes in the slope of the wage Phillips curve may not have been
as large as implied by the unconditional estimates.

Introduction

The deep and prolonged recession triggered by the global …nancial crisis of
2007-2009 led to a large increase in the unemployment rate in most advanced
economies. Ten years later, at the time of writing this paper, the recession
has long ended, and the subsequent recoveries have brought the unemployment
rate to levels close to –and in some cases even below–those at the peak of the
previous expansion. In the U.S. the unemployment rate increased from 4.4.
percent in May 2007 to 10 percent in November 2009. Since that peak was
attained, the unemployment rate has decreased –albeit at a slower pace than in
earlier recoveries– down to its current level below 4 percent. Both movements
represent, respectively, the largest increase and the largest decrease in the unemployment rate experienced by the US economy during the postwar period.
Despite those wide and persistent ‡uctuations in unemployment, in‡ation has
remained surprisingly stable during the same period, as illustrated in Figure
1. The previous phenomenon, often referred to in the literature as the "twin
puzzle," appears to be robust to the measure of in‡ation and economic slack
used,1 and has also been observed in other advanced economies.2
Not surprisingly, central banks around the world have sounded the alarm in
the face of that development, and with good reason.3 For one, a ‡attening of
the Phillips curve implies a larger sacri…ce ratio and the need for more extreme
policy measures in order to eliminate deviations of in‡ation from target. Furthermore, an outright decoupling of in‡ation from indicators of economic slack
would call into question the in‡ation targeting framework widely adopted by
central banks over the past decades, since that framework hinges critically on
the existence of a positive relation between in‡ation and the level of economic
activity, given that it is only through its ability to in‡uence the latter through
an appropriate setting of the interest rate and other policy instruments that
central banks can aim at controlling in‡ation.

In the present paper we revisit a key link of the relation between prices and
economic activity, namely, the relation between wage in‡ation and unemployment. That empirical relation, which was the focus of Phillips’(1958) original
work, is widely perceived to be at the heart of the "twin puzzle." In particular,
the failure of wage in‡ation to respond su¢ ciently to the tightening of the labor
market in recent years is generally viewed as one of the main factors behind the
extremely accommodating monetary policies at central banks like the Federal
Reserve or the ECB. Figure 2 shows a scatterplot of wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate to illustrate that phenomenon. We use quarterly data for the
period 1964Q1-2017Q4.4 As discussed in Galí (2011a), the absence of a clear
inverse relation between the two variables over the full sample period can be
attributed to the large changes in mean in‡ation experienced by the US economy in the ’70s ("the Great In‡ation") and early ’80s (the Volcker disin‡ation).
When we restrict ourselves to the ’60s and the Great Moderation period, a clear
negative relation between the two variables becomes noticeable. Interestingly,
that relation can be seen to become nearly ‡at in the years of the …nancial
crisis and the subsequent recovery, in a way consistent with the "twin puzzle"
hypothesis for price in‡ation.
In the present paper we seek to accomplish two tasks. First, we document
changes in the U.S. wage Phillips curve, using simple reduced form regressions.
Secondly, and after discussing the limitations of such a reduced form approach,
we report estimates of a conditional wage Phillips curve, based on a structural
decomposition of wage, price and unemployment data generated by a VAR with
time-varying coe¢ cients and identi…ed by a combination of long-run and sign
restrictions.
Our main …ndings can be summarized as follows. First, our reduced form
estimates point to a substantial decline in the estimated coe¢ cients on both
lagged in‡ation and unemployment in the U.S. wage Phillips curve. Secondly,
our estimates of conditional wage Phillips curves display similar qualitative re4 The wage in‡ation measure is the (centered) year-on-year change in the (log) average

sults, suggesting that the reduced evidence is not driven by endogeneity problems or possible changes in the relative importance of wage markup shocks. The
conditional evidence, however, suggests that actual changes in the slope of the
wage Phillips curve may not have been as large as implied by the unconditional
estimates. Finally, we show that the reduced sensitivity of wage in‡ation to
unemployment is also re‡ected in the estimated changes in a dynamic multiplier statistic relating the time-varying joint responses of wage in‡ation and
unemployment to both demand and monetary policy shocks.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the reduced form
estimates of a wage Phillips curve and discusses some of its limitations. Section 3
presents our structural VAR model and describes the "semi-structural" evidence
based on it. Section 4 concludes.

Wage In‡ation and Unemployment: Reduced
Form Evidence

In the present section we provide some reduced form evidence on the changing
relation between wage in‡ation and the unemployment rate in the US economy.
The starting point of our empirical analysis is the estimation of a baseline wage
in‡ation Phillips curve given by:
w
t

where

is (annualized) quarterly wage in‡ation (with wt

p

is a measure of price in‡ation (also annual-

ized), and ut is the unemployment rate. A speci…cation similar to (1) has often
been proposed and used in empirical applications.5
Table 1A reports the OLS estimates of

periods, using our baseline speci…cation. We use average hourly earnings of
production and nonsupervisory workers in the private sector from the Establishment Survey to construct our wage in‡ation measure. Our baseline price

in‡ation measure is the (annualized) quarterly rate of change in the GDP de‡ator. The civilian unemployment rate is our measure of unemployment. We
take 2017Q2, which corresponds to the trough in the unemployment rate, to be
the cuto¤ date splitting the two sample periods.
Several observations stand out. First, for the sample period before the …nancial crisis, the coe¢ cients on both lagged in‡ation and unemployment are
highly signi…cant and with the expected sign. In particular, the estimated slope
coe¢ cient suggests that an increase of 1 percentage point in the unemployment
rate is associated with a reduction of (annualized) wage in‡ation of about 30
basis points, given price in‡ation.
We uncover substantial changes within the pre-crisis sample period, however.
Thus, in the 1986Q1-2007Q2 subsample (roughly corresponding to the Great
Moderation) the estimated in‡ation coe¢ cient becomes much smaller (though
still signi…cant), while the negative e¤ect of unemployment on wage in‡ation is
estimated to be about twice as large (and signi…cantly di¤erent from the pre-86
period, as re‡ected in the p-value reported).
Our estimates for the period of crisis and the subsequent recovery, shown
in the bottom panel of the table, point to a large decline in the sensitivity of
wage in‡ation to the unemployment rate, though the coe¢ cient on the latter
still remains signi…cant. While the test of equality of that coe¢ cient between
the full pre-crisis and the post-crisis samples can only reject that hypothesis at
the 10 percent level (see p-value 1), the equality with the "late" pre-crisis period
is rejected with very low p-values (see p-value 2). In addition, it is worth noting
that the estimated coe¢ cient on lagged in‡ation becomes insigni…cant in the
more recent subsample period, suggesting a further decline in the importance
of price indexation in wage setting over the past decade.6
Figures 3A and 3B show the time-varying estimates of ' and , respectively,
based on a rolling OLS regression with a 32-observation window. The estimates
illustrate, in a ‡exible way, the evidence reported earlier, namely, the consecutive

steepening (during the Great Moderation) and ‡attening (during the …nancial
crisis and its aftermath) of the wage Phillips curve in the US, as well as the
seeming irrelevance of lagged price in‡ation since the mid-1980s
The qualitative …ndings discussed above are, for the most part, robust to
alternative speci…cations of equation (1), as shown in Tables 1B (using CPI
in‡ation), 1C (using lagged unemployment), and 1D (using year-on-year lagged
price in‡ation).

2.1

Shortcomings

The evidence reported above, based on OLS estimates of equation (1), has several shortcomings as a measure of the sensitivity of wage in‡ation to variations
in unemployment. Firstly, the speci…cation of (1), while frequently found in
textbooks and empirical applications, is generally viewed as being largely adhoc. In Appendix A1 we provide some possible microfoundations for such a
speci…cation based on the staggered wage-setting model of Erceg et al. (2000)
augmented with partial indexation to (lagged) price in‡ation and reformulated
in terms of unemployment, as in Galí (2011a). The resulting microfounded wage
equation takes the form:
w
t

where , , ', and

=

+

p
t 1

'b
ut + bnw;t

are functions of structural parameters, and bnw;t represents

exogenous ‡uctuations in the natural wage markup.7

Under the previous microfounded interpretation, the assumption of orthogonality between the right hand side variables and the disturbance term in (1) that
would justify the use of OLS is unlikely to be satis…ed in practice. Estimated
DSGE models suggest that natural wage markup shocks are far from negligible sources of macro ‡uctuations. In particular they have signi…cant e¤ects on
both price in‡ation and unemployment.8 The latter observation suggests that
7 The natural wage markup is the gap between the average real wage and the marginal rate
of substitution that would prevail under ‡exible wages.
8 See, e.g. Smets and Wouters (2007) and Galí, smets and Wouters (2012).

reduced form OLS estimates of

and ' would likely be inconsistent. Further-

more, changes over time in the volatility of wage markup shocks could be a
source of spurious changes in the OLS estimates of those coe¢ cients across subsample periods, giving a misleading impression of a "structural change" in the
response of wage in‡ation to unemployment.
Below we propose and implement an empirical framework that aims at assessing possible changes in the responsiveness of wage in‡ation to unemployment
in a way that overcomes (at least in principle) some of the previous limitations
of unconditional reduced form estimates of the wage Phillips curve.

Wage In‡ation and Unemployment: Semi-Structural
Evidence

In the present section we describe our empirical approach to identifying the different components of unemployment, wage in‡ation and price in‡ation, based on
a structural vector autoregression model with time-varying coe¢ cients (TVCSVAR). Our empirical model provides a ‡exible speci…cation which allows for
structural changes in the relation between wage in‡ation and unemployment,
as well as other structural changes that the U.S. economy may have experienced over the sample period considered.9 In addition, our framework makes it
possible to overcome the potential endogeneity problem discussed above. More
generally, our approach allows us to estimate the joint dynamics of wage in‡ation and unemployment in response to monetary policy interventions, and to
uncover any changes over time in those dynamics.

We identify technology shocks, following Galí (1999), as the only shocks in
vector "t to have a long run e¤ect on labor productivity, implemented by imposing C1j
t (1) = 0 for all t and j = 2; 3; 4; 5. In addition to a technology shock,
we assume the existence of four additional shocks typically found in estimated
DSGE models: (non-monetary) demand shocks, monetary policy shocks, price
markup shocks, and wage markup shocks. By construction, those four shocks
are restricted to have only transitory e¤ects on labor productivity. We disentangle them through restrictions on the sign of their implied comovements between
certain variables over a four-quarter horizon after each shock.11 Our sign restrictions are motivated by the predictions of the estimated medium-scale New
Keynesian model with unemployment in Galí, Smets and Wouters (2012).12
Here are our short-run sign restrictions:
Demand shocks (to be understood as non-monetary) are assumed to generate a positive comovement among yt ,

and iL

Monetary policy shocks imply a positive comovement between yt and

Wage markup shocks are assumed to be the only structural disturbances
that generate a positive comovement between

and the unemployment

rate ut , with the latter variable interpreted as a proxy for the wage
markup, following Galí (2011a,b).
Table 2 summarizes our identi…cation strategy in a compact way.
1 1 The use of sign restrictions for identi…cation purposes in structural VARS was pioneered
by Uhlig (2005)
1 2 That model is itself an extension of those in Smets and Wouters (2007) that introduces
an explicit relation between the unemployment rate and the wage markup discussed in Galí
(2011b).

3.2

Conditional Wage Phillips Curves

The next step in our approach consists of re-estimating the wage Phillips curve
(1) using the time series for wage in‡ation, price in‡ation and unemployment,
purged of the component associated with wage markup shocks obtained using the
TVC-SVAR described above. To the extent that the error term in (1) captures
‡uctuations in wage markup shocks, the estimation of such a conditional wage
Phillips curve should overcome any bias resulting from the correlation between
the error term and the regressors.13
Table 3A reports estimates of coe¢ cients

and ' in (1) for di¤erent sample

periods, using the non-wage markup components of the three variables involved.
As in our TVC-SVAR speci…cation, price in‡ation is measured as the log …rstdi¤erence of the GDP de‡ator. As in our baseline estimates of (1) we annualize
both in‡ation variables before applying OLS. The estimates for the full precrisis period point to a smaller price in‡ation coe¢ cient (0:32) and a larger (in
absolute terms) unemployment coe¢ cient ( 0:55) than the "unconditional" estimates of Table 1A. Interestingly, when we now restrict ourselves to the Great
Moderation period, we still get a smaller in‡ation coe¢ cient and larger unemployment coe¢ cient than in the full pre-crisis period, but now the di¤erences
in the estimated coe¢ cients are much smaller (and in case of the in‡ation coe¢ cient, statistically insigni…cant). When we turn to the crisis and recovery
period, we obtain estimates of the in‡ation and unemployment coe¢ cients that
are smaller (in absolute value) than in the pre-crisis period. As in our unconditional estimates of Table 1A for this period, the coe¢ cient on lagged in‡ation
is now insigni…cant. The estimated coe¢ cient on unemployment is signi…cantly
smaller than in the pre-crisis period, though more than twice as large as its
unconditional counterpart.
Figures 4A and 4B reports time-varying estimates of ' and , respectively,
based on rolling OLS regressions with a 32-observation window, applied to the

a New Keynesian Phillips curve for price in‡ation using current and lagged monetary policy
shocks as instruments.

non-wage markup components of the time series involved. Note that, relative
to Figures 3A and 3B, and consistent with the evidence just discussed, the
coe¢ cient on unemployment appears to be more stable over time, and to experience a smaller decline in recent years. On the other hand, the conditional
rolling estimates of the in‡ation coe¢ cient display a pattern very similar to
their unconditional counterparts, though with slighly lower values in the 1980s.
The previous qualitative …ndings are largely robust to alternative speci…cations of conditional wage Phillips curves, as shown in Tables 3B (using lagged
unemployment), and 3C (using year-on-year lagged price in‡ation). An exception to this similarity is given by the estimates of the coe¢ cient on lagged
year-on-year in‡ation in Table 3C, which do not appear to vary signi…cantly
across sample periods.

3.3

Conditional Dynamic Multipliers

The empirical approach described in the previous subsection should in principle
overcome one of the shortcomings of the reduced form evidence, namely, the
potential biases in the OLS estimates of equation (1) resulting from the endogeneity of unemployment and in‡ation with respect to wage markup shocks.
Yet, the estimates of conditional wage Phillips curves are still subject to another important caveat, namely, the ad-hoc speci…cation of (1). In the present
subsection we uncover possible changes over time in the relation between unemployment and wage in‡ation without the straitjacket of any assumed functional
relation between the two variables. Instead, we focus on the estimated impulse
responses generated by our TVC-SVAR and trace the evolution over time of the
dynamic wage in‡ation-unemployment multiplier, de…ned as a ratio of the cumulative impulse responses of those two variables to a given shock "it at di¤erent
horizons:

for K = 0; 1; 2; :::8: A similar impulse response-based statistic was originally
proposed and implemented in Barnichon and Mesters (2018b) in order to mea-

10

sure the sensitivity of price in‡ation to di¤erent slack measures, using a constant
coe¢ cient SVAR.
Figure 5A displays the evolution of the above dynamic multiplier conditional
on monetary policy shocks. As expected, the multiplier is always negative, suggesting that a monetary shocks tends to move wage in‡ation and unemployment
in opposite directions. We also see that its absolute value declines with the horizon, suggesting a more persistent e¤ect of the shock on unemployment than on
wage in‡ation. More interestingly, however, the (absolute) size of the multiplier
appears to decrease over time. This is true at all the horizons considered (up to
eight quarters) but particularly so at the shortest horizons. Thus, in the early
part of the sample, we see how an expansionary monetary policy shock that
drove the unemployment rate down by one percentage point, simultaneously
raises (quarterly) wage in‡ation by about 3 percentage points, implying a multiplier of

3. That short run multiplier decreases over time in absolute value,

to a level close to

1. That …nding is consistent with the evidence in previous

sections pointing to a more muted response of wage in‡ation to ‡uctuations in
unemployment. In contrast with that evidence, however, the present estimates
suggest that such a change in responsiveness has been quite gradual, having
started well before the …nancial crisis.
Figure 5B displays analogous evidence for (non-monetary) demand shocks.
Many of the qualitative patterns observed in Figure 5A are also present here
including the gradual decline in the (absolute) size of the estimated multiplier at
all horizons. A di¤erent picture, however, emerges in Figure 5C, which displays
the dynamic multiplier for price markup shocks, and which does not suggest
any major changes over time.
The above evidence rules out a change in the relative importance of di¤erent
shocks as the main or only source of any reduction in the sensitivity of wage
in‡ation to unemployment ‡uctuations: a change in that relation appears to
have occurred even when one conditions on speci…c shocks. Unfortunately, our
approach cannot shed direct light on the nature of the structural change(s) that
may underlie the lower conditional dynamic multipliers. A greater decoupling
11

of wage in‡ation from price in‡ation, possibly due to a stronger anchoring of
in‡ation expectations associated with the adoption of a price stability-oriented
monetary policy, and captured in our estimates of the wage Phillips curve (both
conditional and unconditional) would limit the so-called second round e¤ects
on wage in‡ation and dampen the response of the latter variable to any given
variation in the unemployment rate, providing a possible explanation to the
evidence above.14

Conclusions

We have started the present paper by documenting the changes in the wage
Phillips curve, using simple reduced form regressions applied to aggregate U.S.
data. In particular, we have provided evidence of a substantial decline in the
estimated coe¢ cients on both lagged in‡ation and unemployment in our wage
Phillips curve. We have also provided estimates of conditional wage Phillips
curves, based on a structural decomposition of wage, price and unemployment
data generated by a VAR with time varying coe¢ cients identi…ed by a combination of long-run and sign restrictions. Our estimated conditional wage Phillips
curves show that most qualitative …ndings from the reduced form evidence are
not driven by endogeneity problems or possible changes in the relative importance of shocks, though such factors may have led unconditional reduced form
estimates to overstate the some of the actual changes. Finally, we have shown
that the reduced sensitivity of wage in‡ation to unemployment is also re‡ected
in the estimated changes in a dynamic multiplier statistic, based on the estimated time-varying impulse responses to monetary policy and demand shocks.
We draw two main conclusions from our …ndings. Firstly, we con…rm the
existence of a growing disconnect between wage in‡ation and unemployment.
Secondly, more research is needed in order to understand the nature of that
phenomenon.

macroeconomics e¤ects of oil price shocks in the 2000s relative to the 1970s.

APPENDIX 2
A1. Some microfoundations for the wage Phillips curve
In this appendix we sketch how one may derive our wage Phillips curve from a
microfounded model. As shown in Galí (2011), the aggregation of wage decisions
by monopolistically competitive unions reoptimizing the nominal wage with a
constant probability every period and with partial indexation to a measure of
p
t 1

lagged price in‡ation

in case of no reoptimization, implies the following

relation between wage in‡ation and the wage markup gap
gap between the average wage markup,

i.e. the

, and the natural (or ‡exible wage)

wage markup,

write:

In addition, and as shown in Galí (2011), the following relation between the
average wage markup and the unemployment rate obtains:

where a "hat" represent deviations from an assumed constant mean. Note that
the previous speci…cation is consistent with the estimated wage Phillips curve
(1), with the error term in the latter capturing exogenous ‡uctuations in the
natural wage markup.

Let

t

= vec(A0t ) where At = [A0;t ; A1;t :::; Ap;t ] and vec( ) is the column

stacking operator. We assume

t

evolves over time according to the following

t

=

equation:
t 1

+ !t

(4)

where ! t is Gaussian white noise vector process with covariance matrix
Time variation of

t

is modeled as follows. Let

t

=

Ft Dt F0t ,

.

where Ft is

lower triangular, with ones on the main diagonal, and Dt a diagonal matrix.

The vector containing the diagonal elements of Dt , denoted by

t,

is assumed

to evolve according to the process

for all j 6= i, and that ! t , "t ,

(for all i)

are mutually independent.

Gibbs sampling algorithm
The Gibbs sampling algorithm is identical to that described in the online
appendix of Galí and Gambetti (2015). We use all the data points available from
1964:Q2 to 2017:Q4. We draw 50000 realizations discarding the …rst 40000 and
then taking 1 out of 10 draws, therefore collecting a total of 1000 realizations.
