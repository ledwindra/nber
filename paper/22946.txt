ABSTRACT
In this paper we develop a new approach to measuring the gains from economic integration based
on a generalization of the Ricardian model in which heterogeneous factors of production are
allocated to multiple sectors in multiple local markets based on comparative advantage. We
implement this approach using data on crop markets in approximately 2,600 U.S. counties from
1880 to 1997. Central to our empirical analysis is the use of a novel agronomic data source on
predicted output by crop for small spatial units. Crucially, this dataset contains information about
the productivity of all units for all crops, not just those that are actually being grown—an
essential input for measuring the gains from trade. Using this new approach we find substantial
long-run gains from economic integration among US agricultural markets, benefits that are
similar in magnitude to those due to productivity improvements over that same period.

Introduction

How large are the gains from economic integration? Since researchers never observe
markets that are both closed and open at the same time, the fundamental challenge in
answering this question lies in predicting how local markets, either countries or regions,
would behave under counterfactual scenarios in which they suddenly become more or
less integrated with the rest of the world.
The standard approach in the international trade literature consists of estimating or
calibrating fully specified models of how countries behave under any trading regime.
Eaton and Kortum (2002) is the most influential application of this approach. A core ingredient of such models is that there exists a set of technologies that a country would have
no choice but to use if trade were restricted, but which the country can choose not to use
when it is able to trade. Estimates of the gains from economic integration, however defined, thereby require the researcher to compare “factual” technologies that are currently
being used to inferior, “counterfactual” technologies that are deliberately not being used
and are therefore unobservable to the researcher. Since information on these counterfactual technologies is not observed, this comparison is typically made through the use of
untestable functional form assumptions that allow an extrapolation from observed technologies to unobserved ones.
The goal of this paper is to develop a new approach to the study of economic integration that is less dependent on extrapolation by functional form assumptions in order
to obtain knowledge of counterfactual scenarios. Our basic idea is to focus on agriculture, a sector of the economy in which scientific knowledge of how essential inputs such
as water, soil and climatic conditions map into outputs is uniquely well understood. As
a consequence of this knowledge, agronomists are able to predict—typically with great
success—how productive a given parcel of land would be were it to be used to grow any
one of a set of crops. In short, both factual and counterfactual technologies are known in
this particular context.
Our theoretical framework is a multi-factor generalization of the Ricardian model of
international trade, as in Costinot (2009). We focus on an economy featuring multiple local markets in which heterogeneous factors of production, which we refer to as “fields,”
are allocated to multiple crops based on comparative advantage under perfect competition. The distinctive feature of our approach is that instead of making specific functional form assumptions about the pattern of comparative advantage across crops and
fields, we use detailed micro-level data from the Food and Agriculture Organization’s
(FAO) Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) project to construct the production possibil-

1

ity frontiers (PPFs) associated with each local market, and in turn, conduct counterfactual
experiments.
We implement our approach in the context of U.S. agricultural markets from 1880 to
1997. This setting offers an uncommonly long stretch of high-quality, comparable microdata from an important agricultural economy plausibly experiencing large changes in
transportation costs. Our dataset consists of approximately 2,600 U.S. counties which we
treat as separate local markets that may be segmented by barriers to trade—analogous
to countries in a standard trade model. Each county is endowed with many “fields” of
arable land—the median U.S. county contains 26 fields—and can produce up to 16 distinct
crops.
Figure 1 presents a sample of the GAEZ predictions about the pattern of comparative
advantage across crops and fields in 2011. Throughout our empirical analysis, we assume
that, within each county, the pattern of comparative advantage predicted by the GAEZ
data is stable over time. That is, if agronomists from the FAO predict that a field is 10%
more productive at producing wheat than cotton in 2011 compared to another field in the
same county, then we assume that it is 10% more productive in all prior years, though
productivity levels are free to vary across crops, across counties, and over time because of
technological innovations or weather shocks. For instance, our empirical analysis allows
the development and adoption of hybrid corn to raise corn productivity differentially
across counties at different points in time; it merely rules out that this technological innovation may have a differential effect on corn productivity across fields from the same
county at a given point in time. Given that counties are relatively small spatial units, we
find this assumption plausible. And it receives some empirical support (within the GAEZ
model), as we discuss below.
In order to quantify the gains from economic integration, we focus on the following
counterfactual question: “For any pair of years, t and t0 , what would the total value of
crops produced in year t have been if trade costs were those of year t0 rather than year
t?” To answer this question we first need estimates of trade costs at different points in
time. We proceed as follows. Under the assumption that the pattern of comparative advantage across crops and fields is stable over time, we show how to combine modern
GAEZ data and historical Census data to identify the spatial distribution of crop prices
and crop-specific productivity shocks across U.S. counties over time. The basic idea is to
find the vector of crop-specific productivity shocks such that the predictions of our perfectly competitive model exactly match total output per crop as well as the total acres of
land allocated to each crop in each county. Using classical results in general equilibrium
theory, we first provide mild sufficient conditions—which we can test in the data—under

wheat (in tonnes/ha) relative to productivity in cotton (in tonnes/ha). Source: Authors’
calculations based on data from the FAO GAEZ project.
which such a vector of shocks is unique. Having identified productivity shocks, we then
back out the vector of crop prices that, according to the model, must have supported this
allocation as a competitive equilibrium. The difference between local crop prices, estimated from the model at the county level, and prices in a “wholesale” market, observed
in historical data, finally give us a measure of trade costs faced by each U.S. county from
1880 to 1997.
Once changes in trade costs have been computed, addressing our main counterfactual
question reduces to solving a simple linear programming problem, namely finding the
vector of output on the PPF of each local market that would be produced given the counterfactual prices. Our results point towards substantial gains from economic integration.
For example, our estimates imply that the gains from integration that were realized between 1880 and 1920 on the supply-side of the US agricultural sector (which we obtain by
setting t = 1880 and t0 = 1920 in the counterfactual question posed above) were equivalent to 1.5% growth in real output per year throughout that 40-year period, or by 79% in
total. Similarly, from 1954-1997 the gains amounted to 1.0% growth per year.
Although our model of U.S. agricultural markets is admittedly stylized, it is rich
enough to fit perfectly historical data on output and land allocation for each crop, each
county, and each year in our dataset. In contrast, there is a priori no reason for the crop
3

prices estimated using our model to fit those observed in the data. As described above,
when inferring local prices, we do not use any direct information on prices: our estimates
are only based on data on historical quantities and modern technology. To explore the
validity of our model, we can therefore compare our estimates of county-level prices to
historical state-level prices, which are the most disaggregated price data available over
the long time period that we are interested in.1 Reassuringly, the fit of our model along
this key dimension is good. Despite the fact that we do not use any direct information on
prices in our estimation, we find a robust, positive correlation between our price estimates
and those observed in the data.
An attractive feature of our approach is that it allows us to estimate simultaneously
trade costs and productivity shocks. Thus we can compare—using the same theoretical
framework and the same data sources—how the gains from economic integration compare to productivity gains in agriculture (i.e., changes in the agricultural PPFs of each
county) over that same period. Formally, we ask: “What would the total value of crops
produced in year t have been if productivity shocks were those of period t0 rather than
period t?” Answering this question again boils down to solving a simple linear programming problem. Our main finding is that the gains from trade cost reductions are similar
in magnitude to those of pure agricultural productivity improvements. Put differently,
our results imply that the impressive growth of U.S. agriculture from 1880-1997 appears
to have been driven in roughly equal parts by improvements in agricultural technology
within locations and by economic integration across locations.
The last part of our paper discusses the sensitivity of this result to a number of strong
assumptions imposed in our baseline analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate that our estimates appear to be largely unaffected when: (i) we allow for a production technology that
uses (equipped) labor as well as land, with the labor intensity and local labor price free
to vary across locations and time; and (ii) when we use alternative methods for handling
corner solutions where a crop is not produced in a county at all. And we find smaller, but
still substantial, gains from economic integration when using an extremely conservative
interpretation of price gaps as pure distortions (rather than transportation costs).
In the existing trade literature, most structural work aimed at quantifying the gains
from international market integration is based on the seminal work of Eaton and Kortum (2002). The standard approach can be sketched as follows. First, combine data on
bilateral imports and trade costs between countries to estimate the elasticity of import demand (most often through a simple gravity equation). Second, use functional forms in the

above, that in which we estimate local prices, would be unnecessary.

model together with elasticity of import demand to predict changes in real consumption
associated with a counterfactual change in trade costs; see Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare
(2013) for an overview. A series of recent papers on economic geography have used a
similar approach to study the implications of domestic market integration; see e.g. Allen
and Arkolakis (2014), Caliendo et al. (2016), Ramondo et al. (2016), and Redding (2016).
Our approach, by contrast, focuses entirely on the supply-side of the economy. First
we combine data on output and productivity to estimate producer prices, and in turn,
trade costs. Second we use the exact same data to predict the value of output associated
with a counterfactual change in trade costs. As emphasized above, the main benefit of
our approach is that it weakens the need for extrapolation by functional form assumptions. The main cost of our approach—in addition to the fact that it applies only to agriculture—is that it does not allow us to talk about welfare. In order to estimate welfare
gains from trade, we would also need consumption data, which is not available at the
county-level in the United States over the extended time period that we consider. Our
gains from economic integration instead correspond to production efficiency gains, i.e. to
outward shifts in the aggregate PPF of the United States holding local PPFs fixed at the
county-level.
Our paper is related more broadly to work on the economic history of domestic market
integration. A first strand of this literature uses market-level price data to estimate the
magnitude of deviations from perfect market integration; see e.g. Slaughter (2001), Shiue
(2005), and Keller and Shiue (2008). Our approach, by contrast, first estimates marketlevel prices (and hence can be applied in settings, like ours, where local price data is not
available), and then goes beyond the previous literature by estimating the magnitude of
the production efficiency gains that would occur if market integration improved.
Another strand of the literature focuses on estimating the impact of past, large infrastructure investments such as railroads and highways; see e.g. Fogel (1964), Fishlow
(1965), Michaels (2008), Duranton and Turner (2012), Herrendorf et al. (2012), Fajgelbaum
and Redding (2014), Faber (2014), Asturias et al. (2016), Alder (2016), Donaldson (2016),
and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016). Here, we remain agnostic about the various potential sources of market integration and develop instead a procedure for measuring the
total gains from such integration by combining information about the observed choices
of farmers at different locations as well as the technologies they have access to.
Finally, we note that the GAEZ database has been used previously by Nunn and Qian
(2011) to obtain predictions about the potential productivity of European regions in producing potatoes, in order to estimate the effect of the discovery of the potato on population growth in Europe. In subsequent work, we have also used the GAEZ database to test
5

the predictions of the Ricardian model (Costinot and Donaldson, 2012) and to evaluate
the consequences of climate change (Costinot, Donaldson and Smith, 2016). In another
follow-up paper, Sotelo (2016) also uses the GAEZ database to quantify the contribution
of trade frictions to the low agricultural productivity of Peru. In addition to the fact that
these papers focus on different countries and time periods, none of them uses theory and
data to infer measures of trade costs and productivity shocks, nor is their focus on inferring realized gains from economic integration over time. As mentioned above, this is the
core of the approach developed here.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our theoretical
framework, describes how to measure local prices and, in turn, how to measure the gains
from economic integration. Section 3 describes the data that feed into our analysis. Section 4 presents our main empirical results. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks. All
formal proofs can be found in the Appendix.

2.1

Theoretical Framework
Basic Environment

Time is discrete and indexed by t. In our empirical analysis, t goes from 1880 to 1997.
At any date t, we consider a static economy with multiple local markets indexed by
i ∈ I ≡ {1, ..., I }, in which production occurs. Each local market is connected to a unique
wholesale market, in which goods are sold. In our empirical analysis, local markets will
be U.S. counties, whereas the unique wholesale market will be New York city. In each
local market, the only factors of production are different types of equipped land or fields
indexed by f ∈ Fi ≡ {1, ..., Fi }. All fields are of the same size, which we normalize to
one. Fields can be used to produce multiple goods indexed by k ∈ K ≡ {1, ..., K + 1}. In
our empirical analysis, goods 1, ..., K will be crops, of which there are 16 in our sample,
whereas good K + 1 will be an outside good. We think of the outside good as manufacturing, forestry, residences, or any agricultural activity (such as livestock production) that
uses land but does not correspond to the crops included in our dataset.
Fields are perfect substitutes in the production of each good, but vary in their exogefk
nous productivity, Ait > 0. Total output of good k in market i at date t is given by
Qitk =

∑ f ∈Fi Ait Lit ,
fk

fk

where Lit ≥ 0 denotes the endogenous share of field f allocated to good k in market i

fk

at date t. Note that Ait may vary both with f and k. Thus, although fields are perfect
substitutes in the production of each good, some fields may have a comparative as well
as an absolute advantage in producing particular goods.
All goods are produced by a large number of price-taking farms and shipped to a
wholesale market. The profits of a representative farm producing good k in a local market
i at date t are given by

where pitk is the farm-gate price of good k in market i at date t. Shipments from the local
markets to its wholesale market are subject to iceberg trade costs. In order to sell 1 unit
of good k in the wholesale market, farmers must ship 1 + τitk units with τitk ≥ 0. Thus,
non-arbitrage requires farm-gate prices, pitk , and prices of goods in the wholesale market,
p̄kt , to satisfy

Finally, factor market clearing in each local market requires

We leave goods market clearing conditions unspecified, thereby treating prices in the
wholesale market, p̄t ≡ ( p̄kt )k∈K , as exogenously given. In the remainder of this paper we

denote by pit ≡ pitk k∈K the vector of farm gate prices, rit ≡ (rit ) f ∈F the vector of field

prices, and Lit ≡ ( Lit )k∈K, f ∈F the allocation of fields to goods in local market i. Armed
with this notation, we formally define a competitive equilibrium as follows.
Definition 1. A competitive equilibrium in a local market i at date t is a field allocation, Lit , and
a price system, ( pit , rit ), such that conditions (1)-(3) hold.

2.2

Identification of Farm-Gate Prices and Productivity Shocks

In this section, we describe how we use theory and data to infer measures of local prices
and productivity across time and space. We separate this description into two parts. The
7

first part focuses on crops for which we observe production in a given location at a particular point in time, which we refer to as “non-zero crops,” while the second part deals
with crops for which we do not observe production, which we refer to as “zero crops.”
Non-zero crops. Our dataset contains, for each local market i ∈ I , year t, and crop
k 6= K + 1, historical measures of each of the following variables: (i ) total farms’ sales,
Ŝit , (ii ) total output per crop, Q̂itk , as well as (iii ) total amount of land allocated to each
crop, L̂itk . Throughout our empirical analysis, we assume that none of these variables is
subject to measurement error—that is, that these variables in the model (written without
hats) equal their equivalents in the data (written with hats).
A1. In all local markets i ∈ I and at all dates t, we assume that

∑k∈K/{K+1} pitk Qitk

= Ŝit ,

Qitk = Q̂itk , for all k 6= K + 1,

∑

fk
L
f ∈Fi it

= L̂itk , for all k 6= K + 1.

(4)
(5)
(6)

By contrast, we do not have access to historical productivity measures. Instead we
fk
have access to measures of productivity, Âi2011 , for each field in each market if that field
were to be allocated to the production of crop k in 2011—the agronomists who have assembled the GAEZ project data in 2011 aim for it to be relevant to contemporaneous
farmers, not those in the distant past. Since we only have access to these measures at one
fk
point in time, we assume that the true productivity Ait is equal to measured productivity,
fk
Âi2011 , times some crop-and-market-and-year specific productivity shock, αitk .
A2. In all local markets i ∈ I and at all dates t, we assume that
fk

fk

Ait = αitk Âi2011 , for all k 6= K + 1, f ∈ Fi .

(7)

The key restriction imposed by equation (7) on the structure of local productivity shocks
is that they do not affect the pattern of comparative advantage across fields within the
same market. If field f 1 is deemed to be relatively more productive than field f 2 at prof 1 k1
f 1 k2
f 2 k1
f 2 k2

f k
have been relatively more productive in all earlier periods, Ait1 1 /Ait1 2 > Ait2 1 /Ait2 2 .
fk
There is of course no available direct test of Assumption A2, since Ait is unobserved. But
fk
the GAEZ project provides calculations of Âi2011 under a range of technology scenarios,
some of which may be more relevant early in our 1880-1997 period, and it is reassuring
to note (as detailed in footnote 7) that the differences in GAEZ model output across such
scenarios are captured well by Assumption A2.
8

In addition, since we do not have any productivity data in the outside sector, we assume that in all local markets i ∈ I and at all dates t, all fields have a common productivf K +1
ity in the outside sector, Ait
= αitK+1 for all f ∈ Fi . For notational convenience, we use
f K +1
the convention Âi2011 ≡ 1 so that equation (7) also holds for the outside sector, though it
should be clear that we do not have any productivity data related to this sector.
fk
From now on we refer to Xit ≡ (Ŝit , Q̂itk , L̂itk , Âi2011 )k6=K +1, f ∈Fi as an observation for market i at date t and to X as the set of observations such that Assumptions A1 and A2 hold.
Given an observation Xit ∈ X , the first goal of our paper is to characterize the vectors of
unobservable productivity shocks and good prices (αit , pit ) that are consistent with perfect competition, as formalized in Definition 1. Let Kit+ ≡ {k ∈ K : Q̂itk > 0 or k = K + 1}
denote the set of non-zero crops, i.e. crops with strictly positive output in local market
K +1
: αk > 0 if k ∈ Kit+ }
i at date t, plus the outside good. In turn, let Ait+ ≡ {α ∈ R+
K +1
and Pit+ ≡ { p ∈ R+
: pk > 0 if k ∈ Kit+ } denote the set of productivity shocks and
prices, respectively, that are non-zero for all these goods k. We define admissible vectors of
productivity shocks and prices as follows.
Definition 2. Given Xit ∈ X , a vector of productivity shocks and good prices (αit , pit ) ∈ Ait+ ×
Pit+ is admissible if and only if there exists a field allocation, Lit , and a vector of field prices, rit ,
such that ( Lit , pit , rit ) is a competitive equilibrium consistent with Xit .
To characterize the set of admissible vectors of productivity shocks and good prices,
we build on the First and Second Welfare Theorems. Namely, we start from the observation that for an allocation to be profit-maximizing, it must be efficient (First Welfare Theorem) and conversely, that any efficient allocation must be profit-maximizing for some
non-zero price vectors (Second Welfare Theorem). Formally, for any Xit ∈ X and any
αit ∈ Ait+ , let L (αit , Xit ) denote the set of solutions of the following planning problem:
max
L ≥0

∑ f ∈Fi αitK+1 Âi2011 L f K+1
f K +1

(P)

subject to:

∑ f ∈Fi αitk Âi2011 L f k ≥ Q̂itk for all k 6= K + 1,
∑k∈K L f k ≤ 1 for all f ∈ Fi .
fk

(8)
(9)

Since constraint (8) must be binding at the solution of the previous linear programming
problem, L (αit , Xit ) characterizes the set of efficient allocations that, conditional on a
vector of productivity shocks αit , are consistent with output levels observed in the data.
9

Using the previous notation, the next theorem characterizes the set of admissible vectors of productivity shocks and good prices.
Theorem 1. For any Xit ∈ X , a vector (αit , pit ) ∈ Ait+ × Pit+ is admissible if and only if (i )
αit ∈ Ait+ is such that

∑ f ∈Fi Lit

fk

= L̂itk for all k ∈ Kit+ / {K + 1} .

(10)

for some Lit ∈ L (αit , Xit ) and (ii ) conditional on αit ∈ Ait+ and Lit ∈ L (αit , Xit ) satisfying
equation (10), pit ∈ Pit+ is such that

∑k∈Kit+ /{K+1} pitk Q̂itk

= Ŝit ,

(11)
fk

fk

αitk pitk Âi2011 ≤ αitk pitk Âi2011 for all k,k0 ∈ K, f ∈ Fi , if Lit > 0.

(12)

Theorem 1 shows that the problem of solving for admissible productivity shocks and
prices reduces to solving linear programs. According to equation (10), admissible vectors
of productivity shocks correspond to vectors of productivity shocks such that the associated solution of ( P)—which is necessarily consistent with output levels observed in the
data, as mentioned above—is consistent with the total amount of land allocated to each
crop in the data.2 Conditional on the vector of productivity shocks and the solutions of
the linear programming problem ( P), admissible prices are then jointly determined by
the zero-profit conditions (1) and (2)—which restricts relative prices through condition
(12)—and the total sales observed in the data—which restricts the overall level of prices
through equation (11).
Since our dataset includes approximately 2,600 counties over 12 decades, having only
to solve linear programs is very appealing from a computational standpoint. In spite
of the high-dimensionality of the problem that we are interested in—we have 16 crops
and the median U.S. county in our dataset features 26 fields—it is therefore possible to
characterize the set of unknowns, i.e. αit and pit for all i and t, in a short period of time
using standard software packages.
Theorem 1 characterizes the set of admissible vectors of productivity shocks and good
prices, but leaves open the possibility that, for arbitrary observations, this set may not
be a singleton. The next theorem provides sufficient conditions under which admissible
vectors of productivity shocks and crop prices are uniquely determined for all non-zero
a solution L of the planning problem ( P), if a crop has zero output, Q̂k = 0, then the acres of land
fk
allocated to that crop are necessarily equal to zero, ∑ f ∈Fi Lit = 0. Thus when matching the land allocation
across crops, we can restrict ourselves to non-zero crops, k ∈ Kit+ / {K + 1}.

Broadly speaking, there are two reasons why there may be more than one admissible
vector of productivity shocks and prices for non-zero crops. First, the pattern of comparative advantage across goods may be “weak.” Second, the output vector associated with
the equilibrium allocation may be collinear to a vertex of the PPF, i.e. we could be at a
“kink.” The proof of Theorem 2 rules out the first possibility by imposing Restriction R1
and the second by imposing Restriction R2. Away from these two knife-edge cases, establishing the uniqueness of an admissible vector of productivity shocks and prices is akin to
the problem of proving the uniqueness of a vector of competitive prices in an endowment
economy (with productivity shocks playing the role of prices, the field allocation playing
the role of demand, and the observed allocation L̂itk playing the role of the exogenous endowments). Since a version of the Gross-Substitute Property holds in our environment,
we can do so using standard arguments.3
Specifically, for N = 2, Restriction R1 states that there does not exist a pair of crops,
k1 and k2 , and a pair of fields, f 1 and f 2 , with the same relative measured productivity,

, but different absolute productivity, Âi2011

. If such

a pair of crops and fields existed, then there would be infinitely many productivity shocks
for which an efficient allocation can match both the observed output levels, Q̂itk1 and Q̂itk2 ,
as well as the total amount of land allocated to each crop, L̂itk1 and L̂itk2 . Starting from a
given field allocation, one could reallocate some acres of field f 1 from crop k1 to crop k2 ,
reallocate the same number of acres of field f 2 from crop k2 to crop k1 , and readjust crop
productivity, αitk1 and αitk2 , to maintain output levels unchanged. By construction, the new

productivity levels would be admissible as well. Restriction R1 extends that basic idea to
larger chains of crops and fields within which such reallocations would be possible.
In contrast, Restriction R2 focuses on cases where productivity shocks are uniquely
determined, but prices are not. At a kink, there is at least one pair of non-zero crops
for which no field is simultaneously producing both crops. For that particular pair of
crops, condition (12) merely puts bounds on admissible relative prices. To deal with such
non-uniqueness issues, Restriction R2 requires that for all pair of non-zero crops, there
exists a “marginal” field producing both crops. Under this restriction, condition (12) implies the stronger prediction that relative prices are uniquely determined by the relative
productivity of the marginal field, as stated at the end of Theorem 2.
While Restrictions R1 and R2 may be important in other contexts, in our particular
context we find that R2 is always satisfied and R1 is violated only extremely rarely—in
less than 0.1% of the county-year observations in our dataset. Our analysis below drops
these counties from all ensuing calculations and estimates.
Figure 2 illustrates graphically how we use aggregate data to infer unobserved farmgate prices and shocks to farmers’ productivity. We consider a hypothetical county with
three fields, and where the county is producing Q̂W units of wheat and Q̂C units of cotton
(and so the relevant two-dimensional component of the PPF is illustrated). For expositional purposes, we decompose our procedure into three steps. Figure 2a represents
how we would estimate prices under the assumption that productivity shocks are Hicksneutral. In this case, the shape of the PPF (solid line) is the same as in the GAEZ data
(dashed line). So, we would only need to use output data to locate the point on the PPF
such that the ratio of output is equal to the ratio observed in the data; the relative price
of cotton would then be given by the slope of the PPF at that point (red line); and the
absolute price would be such that total sales at that point are equal to those in the data,
as per equation (11). Figure 2b maintains the assumption that productivity shocks are
Hicks-neutral, but allows for an outside good. Thus not all land is allocated to cotton and
wheat, hence the change in the shape of the PPF. In this case, we use information on the
total amount of land allocated to crops to solve for the endogenous set of fields producing cotton and wheat. Finally, Figure 2c also allows for non-Hicks-neutral productivity
shocks (common across all fields), as we do in Theorems 1 and 2. In this case, we take
advantage of all the information in our dataset by using output as well as land allocation
data for each crop, not just the aggregate amount of land allocated to all crops. Intuitively,
knowing both total output and total acres of land allocated to each crop, we have then just
enough information to identify crop-specific productivity shocks.4

points to a key difference between crops and the outside good. While we can uniquely determine

Zero crops. Theorems 1 and 2 only provide information about crops that are produced
in a local market at a given date. This is intuitive. For k ∈
/ Kit+ , we know that output
is zero, but since the amount of resources allocated to these crops is also zero, we do
not know whether this outcome reflects low prices or low productivity levels. For our
counterfactual exercises, however, we will need to take a stand on what productivity
shocks and prices were for zero crops, i.e. crops that were not produced. To fill this gap
between theory and data, we make the following assumptions (and return to these in
Section 5.3). First, we assume that whenever a crop is not produced in a given countyyear, the productivity shock is equal to the national average of observed productivity
shocks for that crop, i.e. the average of shocks for counties where that crop is actually
produced in that year.

∑ j∈I :k∈K+jt αkjt , for all k ∈/ Kit+ ,

(13)

where nkt is the number of markets with positive output of crop k in period t.
Second we use the fact that conditional on αitk , condition (12) in Theorem 1 provides an
upper-bound on the relative price of crops with zero output. Ifnk ∈

Assumptions A3 and A4 highlight that our approach is not free of assumptions about
“counterfactual” technologies, as lack of information about zero crops still requires us to
make untestable assumptions about the productivity (and prices) such crops. It should
be clear, however, that this requirement is fairly mild in the sense that Assumptions A3
and A4 do not need to be invoked whenever a field does not produce a crop, they merely
need to be invoked when all fields in a local market do not produce a crop.
the price and productivity of crops under Restrictions R1 and R2, the lack of output data for the outside
good does not allow us to separately identify productivity and prices for that good. Variations in the total
amount of land allocated to crops only allow us to identify the value of the marginal product of land in
the outside sector, that this αitK +1 pitK +1 . This implies, in particular, that we will not be able to measure trade
costs in that sector, a point that we come back to in Section 2.3.

2.3

Counterfactual Analysis

The goal of Section 2.2 above was to infer the unknown farm-gate prices (pitk ) and productivity shocks (αitk ) that prevailed in each local market i, year t, and crop k in our dataset. We
have described a procedure by which these unknowns can be identified from aggregate,
i.e. county-wide, data on farmers’ choices about what to grow using how much land.
We now turn to the second stage of our analysis, in which we aim to measure the gains
from a counterfactual rise in economic integration and compare them to counterfactual
productivity gains in agriculture.
Gains from economic integration. In order to measure gains from economic integration,
we first need to estimate trade costs and how they vary over time. For any crop k 6= K + 1,
either Theorem 2 or Assumption A4 provides a measure of pitk . Thus we can estimate trade
costs by rearranging the non-arbitrage condition between farm-gate prices and prices in
wholesale markets:
p̄k
(15)
τitk = kt − 1, for all k ∈ K / {K + 1} .
pit
Given measures of τitk , we then estimate gains (or losses) from changes in the degree of
economic integration across markets between two years t and t0 by answering the following counterfactual question: “What would the total value of crops produced in year t
have been if trade costs were those of year t0 rather than year t?”
To construct this first set of counterfactual equilibria, we proceed as follows. For each
crop, we assume that farmers in market i at date t maximize profits facing the counterT


factual prices, pik = p̄kt / 1 + τitk 0 , rather than the inferred prices pitk = p̄kt / 1 + τitk ,
where trade costs at dates t and t0 are computed using equation (15). In addition, we as

to be equal to its allocation in the initial equilibrium, Lit
.5 Formally, the field allocation and the supporting field prices in the counterfactual equilibrium, LiT and riT are thus

5 This

assumption implies that our measure of the gains from economic integration will abstract from
any reallocation from the outside good to crops and vice versa. Given our lack of information about the
outside good, in general, and the trade costs that it might face at different points in time, in particular,
we believe that this is the right approach. The only role of the outside good in our paper is to solve for
endogenous sorting of fields into the economic activities for which we have data, i.e. crops.

By construction, ∆WttT0 measures by how much the total value of output across crops between years t and t0 increased (or decreased) because of the change in trade costs between
these two years. It is important to note that in equation (19), we use local prices to evaluate output both in the original and the counterfactual equilibrium. This is consistent
with the view that differences in local crop prices reflect “true” technological considerations: farmers face the “right” prices, but local prices are lower because of transportation
costs. One can therefore think of ∆WttT0 as a measure of aggregate productivity gains in
the transportation sector, broadly defined, between t and t0 .6 We discuss alternative interpretations of price gaps in Section 5.1.
Productivity gains in agriculture. We follow the same approach to estimate the gains (or
losses) from productivity changes in agriculture. Namely, for any pair of years t and t0 ,
we ask: “What would the total value of crops produced in year t have been if productivity
shocks were those of period t0 rather than period t?” The answer to this question provides
an aggregate measure of productivity changes in agriculture between these two periods.
To construct this second set of counterfactual equilibria, we assume that productivity
A
shocks in year t are given by αik = αitk 0 rather than the inferred productivity shocks αitk .
In line with the previous counterfactual exercise, we also assume that the land allocation
to the outside good is the same as in the initial equilibrium. Thus the new field allocation

particular, if there was only one crop and one county, then ∆WttT0 would simply be equal to (1 +
τitk )/(1 + τitk 0 ) − 1.

The rest of our analysis implements the approach described in this section in the context
of U.S. agricultural markets from 1880 to 1997.

Data

Our analysis draws on three main sources of data: modern data on predicted productivity
by field and crop from the FAO-GAEZ project; historical county-level data from the US
Agricultural Census on output by crop, cultivated area by crop, and total sales of all crops;
and historical data on prices. We describe these here in turn.

3.1

Modern Productivity Data

The first and most novel data source that we make use of provides measures of productivfk
ity, Âi2011 , by crop k, county i, and field f in 2011. These measures come from the Global
Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) project run by the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). The GAEZ aims to provide a resource that farmers and government agencies can
use (along with knowledge of prices) to make decisions about the optimal crop choice in
a given location that draw on the best available agronomic knowledge of how crops grow
under different conditions.
The core ingredient of the GAEZ predictions is a set of inputs that are known with
extremely high spatial resolution. This resolution governs the resolution of the final grid
cells in the GAEZ database and, equally, the resolution of the “fields” in our analysis.

17

There are a total of 114,071 fields in the U.S. counties that comprise our empirical analysis,
with 26 fields in the median county.
The inputs to the GAEZ database are data on an eight-dimensional vector of soil types
and conditions, the elevation, the average land gradient, and climatic variables (based on
rainfall, temperature, humidity, sun exposure), in each field. These inputs are then fed
into an agronomic model—one for each crop—that predicts how these inputs affect the
“microfoundations” of the plant growth process and thereby map into crop yields. Naturally, farmers’ decisions about how to grow their crops and what complementary inputs
(such as irrigation, fertilizers, machinery and labor) to use affect crop yields in addition
to those inputs (such as sun exposure and soil types) over which farmers have very little
control. For this reason the GAEZ project constructs different sets of productivity predictions for different scenarios of farmer inputs. Throughout we use the scenario that relates
to a high level of such inputs (including irrigation).7
Finally it is important to emphasize that while the GAEZ project has devoted a great
deal of attention to testing their predictions on knowledge of actual growing conditions
(e.g. under controlled experiments at agricultural research stations) the GAEZ project
does not form its predictions by estimating any sort of statistical relationship between
observed inputs around the world and observed outputs around the world. Indeed, the
model outlined above illustrates how inference from such relationships could be misleading; the average productivity among fields that produce a crop in any given market and
time period is endogenous and conditioned on the set of fields who choose to produce
that crop at prevailing prices.

3.2

Historical Output, Area and Sales Data

The second set of data on which we draw contains records of actual output by crop,
Q̂itk , area of land harvested under each crop, L̂itk , and the nominal value of total sales
of all crops taken together, Ŝit , in each U.S. county from 1880-1997.8 These measures
7 Since we allow for crop-and-market-and-year specific productivity shocks, different GAEZ scenarios
may only affect our estimates of changes in prices and productivity over time if they predict different
relative productivity across fields within the same county. To get a sense of the sensitivity of our results
to the choice of alternative GAEZ scenarios, we can therefore regress the predicted productivity of field
f for crop k in county i under each available alternative scenario on a crop-county-scenario fixed effect.
If the R-squared of that regression was 1, then choosing different GAEZ scenarios would have no effect
on our empirical results. We find that the R-squared ranges from 0.78 to 0.82. This suggests that using
alternative GAEZ scenarios is unlikely to have quantitatively important effects on our measure of the gains
from economic integration.
8 We refer to the years in our dataset by the years in which the corresponding Census was published
(e.g. 1880) rather than the year in which farmers were enumerated (1879).

come from the Census of Agriculture that began in 1840 and has been digitized in Haines
(2005).9 The Census was conducted decadally until 1950 and then roughly once every five
years thereafter; however, the 1930 and 1940 data are not available in digital form (for all
counties in our sample), and the 1950 data do not contain all of the information required
for comparison with later years. Although the total output of each crop in each decade in
each county is known, such measures are not available for spatial units smaller than the
county (such as the field, the resolution at which the GAEZ data are available).
An important consideration when using the data on total crop sales to construct Ŝi
is that farmers from 1880-1920 were asked to report the total value of crops produced,
whereas from 1954 onwards farmers were asked to report the value of crops actually
sold. For this reason in our use of the data here we simply avoid making comparisons
across the 1920-1954 period in which the two proxies for Ŝi differ.
Throughout, we use only the regions spanning the 2,636 counties that reported agricultural output data in 1880; see Figure 3.10 Finally, we work with 16 major crop categories that can be tracked across the entire 1880-1997 period (and for which output, area
and total sales data are available in each sample year). These crops are listed in Table 1
below.

3.3

Historical Price Data

In our empirical analysis, we assume that all of the counties in our sample (of Eastern U.S.
counties) were trading at least some of their output with one major agricultural wholesale
market, that in New York City. This implies that the New York City price can be used as
the reference price (since free arbitrage would ensure that, under this assumption, pitk =

p̄kt / 1 + τitk always holds). We further assume that trade costs within New York state
were small (relative to the costs of trading at longer distances) such that we can obtain an
estimate of the reference price, the New York City wholesale market price, from the New
York state farm-gate price.
We obtain New York state farm-gate prices from two data sources. First, we use the
Agricultural Time Series-Cross Section Dataset (ATICS) from Cooley et al. (1977), which

9 While the Agricultural Census began in 1840, it was not until 1880 that the question on value of total
crop sales was added. For this reason we begin our analysis in 1880.
10 The exact set of counties changed across Census years (rising to 2,993 by 1997) due to redefinitions of
county borders. None of our analysis requires the ability to track specific counties across time so we work
with this unbalanced panel of counties. When mapping a county in year t to the same county in year t0 we
use the county whose geographic centroid in year t0 is closest to the centroid of the county in question from
year t.

covers the period from 1866 (at the earliest) to 1970 (at the latest).11 Second, we have
extracted all of the post-1970 price data available on the USDA (NASS) website so as to
create a price series that extends from 1880 to 1997.
We use the same data sources to obtain historical crop prices in all other states. While
such data is not necessary for our counterfactual analysis, below we assess the goodness
of fit of our model by comparing farm-gate prices observed at the state-level to the withinstate average of county-level prices predicted by our model.12

Empirical Results

Our empirical analysis uses Theorems 1 and 2 to estimate the local prices and productivity
shocks for each of our 16 crops in each of our approximately 2,600 counties, in each of our
sample years from 1880 to 1997. In Sections 4.1 and 4.2, we start by presenting summary
statistics of these estimates and explore their plausibility. We then go on, in Section 4.3,
to use these estimates to compute the gains from economic integration and productivity
gains within U.S. crop agriculture from 1880 to 1997.

Estimates of Farm-Gate Prices and Productivity Shocks

Table 1 reports the national average and standard deviation of the farm-gate prices estimated using Theorems 1 and 2 for our 16 crops in 1880, 1920, 1950, and 1997. All prices are
reported relative to the New York price. Two broad trends are evident. First, the farmgate price (relative to the New York price) is rising over time, which is consistent with
a broad reduction in trade barriers. And second, the standard deviation (within crops,
across counties) appears to also be falling over time—consistent again with reductions in
trade barriers and market integration.13
Analogously to Table 1, our estimates of productivity shocks αitk are reported in Table
2. Naturally, the general trend here is of technological progress throughout the history
of US Agricultural Census data from 1880-1997, as the reported estimates of αitk are rising
almost uniformly over time from 1880-1997. And reassuringly, the magnitude of αitk for
13 In the discussion above, we have assumed that all local markets export to the wholesale market.

Under
this assumption, local prices should always be lower than prices in the wholesale market. In the data, they
are not. Thus our results implicitly rely on the assumption that there is measurement error in the prices of
the wholesale market, which we do not find implausible. As long as measurement error is constant across
crops and over time, measurement error does not affect the measure of the gains from economic integration
given by equation (19).

most crops appears to be converging to a level that is relatively close to 1 by 1997. This is
fk
consistent with the notion that GAEZ’s estimates of agricultural productivity (i.e. Âi2011 ),
which are designed to be relevant in 2011, are on average not far off the magnitudes
required for our model to rationalize the data in 1997.

4.2

Model Fit

By construction, our model perfectly fits data on (i ) total farms’ sales, Ŝit , (ii ) total output
per crop, Q̂itk , as well as (iii ) total amount of land allocated to each crop, L̂itk , in all counties
at all points in time. To evaluate the goodness of fit of our model, we therefore propose to
compare our estimates of local prices—estimates that have been computed without using
any direct information on prices—to the prices that are actually observed in the data.14
14 One could also imagine comparing the productivity shocks inferred form our model to those observed

in the data. It is less clear, however, how to define “observed productivity” and how to interpret differences
between our estimates of productivity shocks, αitk , and “observed productivity.” Suppose, for instance, that
we were to use Q̂itk / L̂itk as observed productivity in county i for crop k at date t. Seen through the lens of
our model, differences between αitk and Q̂itk / L̂itk can always be interpreted as a measure of the importance
of the endogenous sorting of heterogeneous fields across crops. This implies that these differences cannot
shed light on whether inferred productivity shocks are plausible or not.

Observations

Notes: Columns (1) and (5) report uncentered R-squared values. Columns (1)-(4) report regressions of our
estimates of farm-gate prices, pitk , (averaged across all counties i in a state) on state-level farm-gate price
data. Columns (5)-(8) do the same but with both variables in logs. Robust standard errors, clustered at the
state-level, are reported in parentheses. *** indicates statistically significant at 0.1% level.

As mentioned before, the best available farm-gate price data available are at the statelevel, whereas our price estimates are free to vary at the county-level. In order to compare
our price estimates to the state-level price data we therefore simply compute averages
across all counties within each state, for each crop and year.15 We then simply regress
our price estimates on the equivalent prices in the data, pooling across crops, states, and
years.
Table 3 contains the results of these simple regressions in logs or levels, with or without constant, with or without crop and year fixed effects. In all cases we find a positive
and statistically significant correlation between the two price series, with a coefficient
that varies between 0.69 and 1.05 depending on the specification.16 While most of the
coefficient estimates are below one (the result that would obtain if price estimates agreed
perfectly with price data) this is unsurprising given that the regressor, actual price data,
is potentially mis-measured from our perspective because it constitutes a state-level average of underlying price observations whose sampling procedure is unknown. Since our
procedure for estimating local prices had nothing to do with price data at all—its key
inputs were data on quantities and technology—we view the robust correlation between
our price estimates and price estimates in real data as reassuring.

have also looked at the correlation between relative, i.e. across crops, within state-years price
estimates and price data by running regressions across all (unique and non-trivial) such crop pairs for
which data are available. The coefficients are again positive, statistically significant, and range from 0.58 to
0.89.

Gains from Economic Integration

We now turn to our estimates of the gains from economic integration. As discussed in
Section 2.3 above, we estimate these gains between any dates t and t0 by answering the
following counterfactual question: “What would the total value of crops produced in year
t have been if trade costs were those of year t0 rather than year t?” Armed with estimates
of local farm-gate prices, we then compute these gains or losses using equations (15)-(19).
We focus on two groups of counterfactual scenarios that correspond to the periods
1880-1920 and 1954-1997. As mentioned in Section 3.2, the sales data (used to construct
Ŝi ) cannot be used to draw comparisons between years prior to 1920 and years after 1954.
In the first group of counterfactual scenarios, t0 corresponds to 1920 and t corresponds to
years from 1880 to 1920. In the second one, t0 corresponds to 1997 and t corresponds to
years from 1954 to 1997.
Our results are presented in Figure 4a (for 1880-1920) and Figure 4b (for 1954-1997). In
T , for the comparisons of t0 to t referred
each case, the blue line plots our estimates of ∆Wt,t

T is expressed as an annualized growth rate between year t and year t0 .17 For
time—∆Wt,t
0
example, the gains from 1880 to 1920 revealed here are equal to 1.46% of annual growth
in real output over each of the 40 years from 1880 to 1920—equivalent to 79.3% growth
in total over the 40-year time period.18 And the estimated gains from 1954 to 1997 are
equivalent to 1.02% annual growth per year for 43 years (i.e. 55.0% growth in total).
These estimates imply that substantial inter-spatial price differences have existed within
the United States, but that these differences have become smaller over time (both before
and after the second World War).
To put these estimates in context we compare them, in Figures 4a and 4b, to the growth
of productivity within the agricultural sector; that is, we plot (in green) the counterfactual
change in real output that value of output, ∆WttA0 , that would have occurred purely due
to the change in agricultural productivity between t and t0 (again expressed in terms of
annualized effects). If we consider instead this counterfactual scenario in which year t
technology is replaced with year t0 technology (holding trade costs and hence prices fixed
at their year t levels) we again find large per annum gains—for example, of 0.82% per
year from 1880 to 1920 or 1.22% per year from 1954 to 1997. That is, gains from economic
integration (shown in red) are in most years similar in magnitude to the gains from pure

Sensitivity Analysis

To measure the gains from economic integration and compare them to productivity gains
in agriculture, we have made a number of strong assumptions. First, we have interpreted
the price gaps inferred from our model as transportation costs between local and wholesale markets. Second, we have assumed that equipped land was the only factor of production. Third, we have assumed that for all zero-crops, productivity shocks were equal to
their national average and prices were equal to their upper-bounds. We now discuss the
sensitivity of our estimates of the gains from economic integration to these assumptions.

5.1

Alternative Interpretations of Price Gaps


In our baseline analysis, we have interpreted price gaps, τitk = p̄kt /pitk − 1, inferred from
our model as transportation costs. Under this interpretation, the prices used to estimate
the value of output should be local prices, as in equation (19). In the same spirit as the
work of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) on misallocations, we now propose to interpret price
gaps as “wedges,” i.e. taxes, that may vary across crops over space at different points
in time. The basic idea is that in order to maximize total agricultural revenue in the
United States, local farmers should be maximizing profits taking the reference prices p̄kt
as given, but because of various local policy reasons, summarized by τitk , they do not.
25

In practice, such distortions may reflect location-specific quotas on certain agricultural
commodities, as described by Bridgman et al. (2015), or commodity-specific exemptions
from transportation regulations, as discussed in Black (1955).19 Under this alternative
interpretation of price gaps, the gains from economic integration can be measured as:
∆WttD0

∑i∈I ∑k6=K +1 p̄kt Q̂itk

Like in Section 5, Qik denotes the counterfactual output level of crop k in market i at
date t when crop producers in market i at date t maximize profits facing the counterfac

T
tual prices, pik = p̄kt / 1 + τitk 0 , rather than the inferred prices pitk = p̄kt / 1 + τitk . The
only difference between equations (19) and (24) is that equation (24) evaluates the output bundle using prices in the wholesale market rather than (distorted) local prices. This
implies that under the interpretation of price gaps as distortions, the absolute level of
T
prices in the counterfactual equilibrium, pik , is irrelevant. Only relative prices matter
T
through their effect on the output decision in the counterfactual equilibrium, Qik . Under the interpretation of price gaps as transportation costs, in contrast, the absolute level
of prices has a direct effect on the gains from economic integration; see equation (19).20
Figure 5 displays our estimates of the gains from economic integration in US agricultural markets from 1880-1997 under the alternative, and more conservative, interpretation
of price gaps described above. Analogously to Figure 4, we plot (in Figure 5a) the value
of ∆WttD0 (in red), expressed in terms of percentage changes per year from t to t0 , for the
case where t0 = 1920 and t is each available Census year from 1880-1920; the equivalent is
shown for the 1954-1997 in Figure 5b. We similarly plot ∆WttA0 , the gains from pure productivity improvements, in green for the sake of comparison between gains from integration
and gains from movements in county PPFs. It is clear that, as expected, an interpretation of price gaps as pure transportation costs that consume resources in shipping (∆WttT0 ,
from Figure 4) leads to larger estimated gains than an interpretation of these price gaps
as pure policy distortions that redistribute revenue lump-sum (∆WttD0 , from Figure 5). But

way to relate the gains from economic integration given by equations (19) and (24) is to
rearrange equation (19) as
20 Another

∑i∈I ∑k6=K +1 p̄kt Qik /(1 + τitk 0 )
∑i∈I ∑k6=K +1 p̄kt Q̂itk /(1 + τitk )

− 1.

Both formulas therefore implicitly use prices in the wholesale market to compute the total value of output,
but if price gaps reflect trade costs, the output levels at the wholesale market should be scaled down by the
extent of the trade costs.

even the pure policy distortions interpretation of price gaps suggests that the gains from
economic integration have been significant—0.48% per year from 1880 to 1920 and 1.24%
per year from 1954 to 1997. These results imply that even under the conservative interpretation of price gaps as pure wedges, with no direct resource cost, the homogenization
of agricultural prices within the U.S. from 1880-1997 has led to sizable gains.

5.2

Multiple factors of production

The baseline results in Section 4 implicitly rely on the assumption that each crop is produced using land and other factors of production in a similar Leontief fashion over time.
fk
Namely, we assume that productivity in the GAEZ data, Âi2011 , can be interpreted as the
productivity of “equipped” land and that the time variation in land “equipment” does
not violate Assumption A2.
In this subsection, we generalize our approach to allow for some substitution between
factors of production and for factor intensity to vary over time and space. Formally, we
assume the production for each crop k in a local market i at date t is now given by

that land was interpreted as equipped land in our baseline model, labor should now be

Definition 1 generalizes to this new environment in a straightforward manner.
In order to implement our estimation approach in this new environment, we use historical data on an additional variable, also available from the U.S. Census of Agriculture:

21 Formally,

if Nit 6= 1, then we can change units of account for workers such that the the new number

Given this change of notation, Theorem 1 still holds in this richer environment. Accordingly, we can estimate trade costs and the gains from economic integration in the exact
same way as we did in Section 2.3.
Table 4 reports the estimated gains from economic integration using this alternative
procedure with multiple factors of production. For purposes comparison, the first row
summarizes the gains reported in Figures 4 and 5 above—the gains from integration under two extreme alternative interpretations of price gaps (∆WttT0 in columns 1 and 4, ∆WttT0
in columns 3 and 6) and the gains from pure agricultural productivity improvements
(∆WttA0 in columns 2 and 5). We focus on the early and late long-difference changes: from
t = 1880 to t0 = 1920 (columns 1-3), and from t = 1954 to t0 = 1997 (columns 4-6). The
second row of Table 4 then reports on an alternative set of estimates calculated using the
multi-factor production function in equation (25). Evidently, our baseline estimates (in
the first row) are not particularly sensitive to our earlier assumption that all counties and
and time periods used equipped land as the only factor of production in agriculture (the
restriction that β it = 0 for all counties i and years t). For example, we estimate in the second row that the gains from economic integration between 1880 and 1920 were 1.43% per
year, rather than 1.46% per year as in our baseline (first row). And the effect of this alternative modeling assumption on the estimated gains in the later period appears similarly
slight. So while the price of labor relative to land will have differed greatly over space
and time throughout our 1880-1997 sample period, these developments do not appear to
have large effects on our estimates of the gains from economic integration.

5.3

Alternative Treatment of Zero-Crops

Whenever a county does not produce a crop, we have much less information about the
price and productivity in that county. In Section 2.2, we have dealt with this issue by
assuming that: (i ) the productivity of zero-crops is equal to their national average (Assumption A3) and (ii ) the local price of zero-crops is such that farmers are indifferent
between producing this crop and other crops (Assumption A4). The previous strategy
implicitly gives the “extensive margin” an important role in our counterfactual exercises:
whenever the counterfactual productivity or price of a zero-crop goes up relative to other
crops, it should start being produced.
To assess the sensitivity of our results to this treatment of zero crops, we focus here
instead on the polar case in which the “extensive margin” is not in operation. Formally,
we assume that if a county i does not produce crop k at date t, then its productivity is
equal to zero:
αitk = 0, for all k ∈
/ Kit+ .
Under this assumption, whenever a crop has zero output in a county, its output must
remain equal to zero in all counterfactual scenarios.
The last row of Table 4 presents our counterfactual results under this alternative treatment of zero crops. We again see that none of our estimates (for WttT0 , WttA0 or WttD0 , and
for early or late pairs of years t and t0 ) changes a great deal in response to the alternative
treatment of zero-crops introduced here. The estimated gains from economic integration
that emerge from our procedure continue to be substantial—for example, ranging from
1.06% to 0.31% per year annually between 1954 and 1997, depending on the interpretation
of price gaps used.

Concluding Remarks

We live in a global world. Markets are probably more integrated today than at any point
in the past. What if they were not? What would an economy like the United States look
like in a counterfactual world without market integration? How much poorer would that
hypothetical economy be?
Answers to such questions typically rely on strong and untestable functional form assumptions—the production-side gains from trade hinge, unavoidably, on what happens
when producers reallocate from the technologies that are observable to the econometrician (because they are being used by producers) to ones that are simply unknown from
the econometrician’s perspective.
In this paper, we have proposed a new approach, applicable to the agriculture, whose
main goal is to weaken the reliance on functional form assumptions and, in turn, increase
the credibility of the answers building upon them. Central to our approach is the use of
a novel agronomic data source on predicted output by crop for small spatial units. Crucially, this dataset contains information about the productivity of all spatial units for all
crops, not just the endogenously selected crop that farmers at each spatial have chosen
to grow in some equilibrium. Using this new approach we have estimated (i ) the spatial
distribution of price wedges across U.S. counties in 1880 and 1997 and (ii ) the gains associated with changes in the level of these wedges over time. Our estimates imply that
the gains from integration amount US counties from 1880 to 1997 have been substantial—similar in magnitude to the considerable productivity gains over that period.
A similar approach could be used to study how agricultural trade policies set in developed economies affect households in developing countries. Since trade policies distort
relative prices and lead farmers to grow crops conditioned on these distorted prices, the
central challenge involved when studying proposed changes to these policies lies in predicting farmers’ productivities in crops that they are not currently growing (and hence
cannot be observed). We believe the GAEZ data offer a particularly credible way to solve
this identification problem, just as it did in the historical U.S. context, and hence could
be used to provide plausible answers to questions concerning the impact of proposed
agricultural trade policy adjustments, such as those discussed during the World Trade
Organization’s Doha Round, on food prices, trade flows, nutrition, poverty, and welfare.

Proof of Theorem 1

For notational convenience, and without any risk of confusion, we drop all market and time indices, i and t, from the proof of Theorem 1 and all subsequent proofs.
Proof of Theorem 1. We proceed in two steps.
Step 1: For any X ∈ X , if (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + are such that there exists L ∈ L (α, X ) satisfying conditions

(10)-(12), then it is admissible.
By Definitions 1 and 2, we want to show that one can construct a vector of field prices, r, and
an allocation of fields, L, such that conditions (1)-(6) hold. A natural candidate for the allocation
is L ∈ L (α, X ) such that equations (10)-(12) hold. The fact that equations (3) and (5) hold for
allocation L is immediate from the fact that L ∈ L (α, X ). The fact that equations (4) and (6)
hold as well derive from equations (10) and (11), together with the fact that if k ∈
/ K + , then
∑ f ∈F L f k = 0. Let us now construct the vector of field prices, r, such that r f = maxk∈K pk αk Â f k for
all f ∈ F . By Assumption A2, we can rearrange the previous expression as r f = maxk∈K pk A f k .
This immediately implies inequality (1). To conclude, note that by condition (12), together with
0

0

Assumption A2, we must have pk A f k = maxk0 ∈K pk A f k = r f if L f k > 0. Thus equation (2) holds
as well.
Step 2: For any X ∈ X, if (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + is admissible then there exists L ∈ L (α, X ) such that
conditions (10)-(12) hold.
By Definitions 1 and 2, if (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + is admissible given X ∈ X , then there exist r and
L such that conditions (1)-(7) hold. Equation (6) immediately implies equation (10). Conditions

(1) and (2)—together with Assumption A2—imply condition (12). Finally, equations (4) and (5)
imply equation (11). To conclude, note that by conditions (1)-(3), L is a feasible allocation that
maximizes total profits. Thus By the First Welfare Theorem (Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green
(1995) Proposition 5.F.1), we must have L ∈ L (α, X ).

Proof of Theorem 2

B.1

Preliminary Results

Before establishing the proof of Theorem 2, it is useful to establish a number of preliminary results.
Let L̃(α, X ) denote the set of solutions of
max
(L f k )

∑ f ∈F αK+1 Â f K+1 L f K+1

(27)

∑ f ∈F αk Â f k L f k ≥ ∑ f ∈F αK+1 Â f K+1 L f K+1 for all k ∈ K+ / {K + 1} ,
∑k∈K L f k ≤ V̂ f for all f ∈ F ,

(29)

L f k ≥ 0, for all k ∈ K, f ∈ F .

(30)

(28)

For future reference note that for any X ∈ X and α ∈ A+ , we can write L̃(α, X ) in a more compact
(K +1)× F

form as L̃(α, X ) = arg max L∈L mink∈K+ {∑ f ∈F αk Â f k L f k }, where L ≡ { L ∈ R+

: ∑k∈K L f k ≤
V̂ f } for all f ∈ F is the set of feasible allocations. The rest of this subsection establishes properties

of L̃(α, X ) that we will use to establish Theorem 2 in the next subsection. We first use a version of
the second welfare theorem to show that any allocation in L̃(α, X ) is associated with a competitive
equilibrium.
F such
Lemma 1. For any α ∈ A+ and any X ∈ X , if L ∈ L̃(α, X ), then there exist p ∈ P + and r ∈ R+

that ( L, p, r ) is a competitive equilibrium.

Proof. Let Q ≡ Qk

k ∈K

denote the production vector associated with L ∈ L̃(α, X ). By definition

of L̃(α, X ), Q is efficient. To see this, note that if there were Q0 ≥ Q with Q0 6= Q, then by
Assumption A2, we would have ∑ f ∈F A f k L0 f k ≥ ∑ f ∈F A f k L f k for all k, with strict inequality for
some k0 ∈ K. Thus starting from the allocation L0 associated with Q0 , we could reallocate a small
amount of at least one field from k0 to all other goods in K + . By construction, the new allocation
L00 would be such that mink∈K+ {∑ f ∈F A f k L00 f k } > mink∈K+ {∑ f ∈F A f k L f k }, which contradicts
L ∈ L̃(α, X ). Since Q is efficient and production functions are linear—which implies that the
production set is convex—Proposition 5.F.2 in Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995) implies the
K +1
F such that conditions 1 and 2 are
existence of non-zero price vectors p ∈ R+
and r ∈ R+
( )
( )

satisfied. Furthermore, p must be such that pk > 0 for all k ∈ K + . To see this note that if there
exists k0 ∈ K + such that pk0 = 0, then equation (2) implies r f = 0 for some f ; in turn, condition

(1) implies pk = 0 for all k ∈ K; and finally, equation (2) implies r f = 0 for all f , contradicting
the fact that ( p, r ) is non-zero. Finally, since L ∈ L̃(α, X ), equation (3) is satisfied as well, which
concludes our proof.
The next Lemma establishes joint properties of any pair of competitive equilibria.

Lemma 2. Consider α, α0 ∈ A+ and X ∈ X such that ( L, p, r ) is a competitive equilibrium conditional

(ii ) for any f ∈ F and k 6= k0 ∈ K + , L f k − L0 f k 6= 0 and L f k − L0 f k 6= 0 imply pk /pk = A f k /A f k .
Proof. Suppose that ( L, p, r ) is a competitive equilibrium conditional on α and X and that ( L0 , p0 , r 0 )
is a competitive equilibrium conditional on α0 and X. Let us introduce the following notation. First
let K0 = K̄0 = K + and for n ≥ 1, let K n and K̄n be such that

K n = arg min

k ∈K̄n−1

o
α0k p0k /αk pk ,

K̄n = K̄n−1 /K n .
By construction, there exists n ≥ 1 such that {K1 , ..., K n } is a partition of K + . Second for any


subset K̃ ⊂ K + , let L f K̃ ≡ ∑k∈K̃ L f k and L0 f K̃ ≡ ∑k∈K̃ L0 f k . Third let Fn and Fn0 denote the


subset of fields such that L f K̄n > 0 and L0 f K̄n > 0, respectively.


We will first show by iteration that for all n ≥ 0, (i ) L f (K n ) = L0 f (K n ) and L f K̄n = L0 f K̄n
for all f ∈ F , and (ii ) Fn = Fn0 . For n = 0, this is trivial since L, L0 being associated with
competitive equilibria imply L f (K + ) = L0 f (K + ) = V̂ f and Fn = Fn0 = F . Now suppose that
this it is true for n ≥ 0 and let us show that is true for n + 1. If Fn = Fn0 = ∅, this is trivial again


since L f (K n+1 ) = L0 f (K n+1 ) = 0, L f K̄n+1 = L0 f K̄n+1 = 0, and Fn+1 = Fn0 +1 = ∅. Thus
suppose that Fn = Fn0 6= ∅. We proceed in two steps.


Step 1: For all f ∈ F , L0 f K̄n+1 ≥ L f K̄n+1 .


First note that if f ∈
/ Fn , then L0 f K̄n+1 = L f K̄n+1 = 0. Thus the above inequality holds.


Now consider f ∈ Fn . We proceed by contradiction. Suppose that L0 f K̄n+1 < L f K̄n+1 . Since


L f K̄n = L0 f K̄n , this implies L0 f (K n+1 ) > L f (K n+1 ) ≥ 0. Thus there must be k1 ∈ K n+1
such that L0 f k1 > 0. By conditions (1) and (2), this further implies p0k1 α0k1 Â f k1 ≥ p0k αk Â f k for all
k ∈ K + , which can be rearranged as

Since α0k1 p0k1 /αk1 pk1 ≤ α0k p0k /αk pk for all k ∈ K̄n , with strict inequality for k ∈ K̄n+1 , this implies

αk Â f k

for all k ∈ K̄n , with strict inequality if k ∈ K̄n+1 .


Together with conditions (1) and (2), the previous series of inequalities implies L f K̄n+1 = 0,


which contradicts L f K̄n+1 > L0 f K̄n+1 ≥ 0.


Step 2: For all f ∈ F , L0 f K̄n+1 = L f K̄n+1 , L f (K n+1 ) = L0 f (K n+1 ), and Fn+1 = Fn0 +1 .

37



First note that if f ∈
/ Fn , then L0 f K̄n+1 = L f K̄n+1 = 0 and L f (K n+1 ) = L0 f (K n+1 ) = 0.
Thus the two previous equations hold. Now consider f ∈ Fn . Suppose that there exists f ∈ Fn

such that L0 f K̄n+1 > L f K̄n+1 . By Step 1, we know that L0 f K̄n+1 ≥ L f K̄n+1 for all

f 0 ∈ F . By assumption, we also know that L f K̄n = L0 f K̄n for all f 0 ∈ F . We must therefore

have L0 f (K n+1 ) ≤ L f (K n+1 ) with strict inequality for some f 0 . This implies that ∑ f ∈F L f k 6=
∑ f ∈F L0 f k for some k ∈ K + , which contradicts ∑ f ∈F L f k = ∑ f ∈F L0 f k for all k ∈ K + . Thus, we




must have L0 f K̄n+1 = L f K̄n+1 for all f ∈ F , L0 f K̄n+1 = L f K̄n+1 , which also implies
L f (K n+1 ) = L0 f (K n+1 ) and Fn+1 = Fn0 +1 .
We are now ready to establish Properties (i ) and (ii ). Consider f 0 ∈ F and k0 ∈ K + such that
L0 f0 k0 > 0. Let n0 be such that k0 ∈ K n0 . By the previous result we know that if L0 f0 k0 > 0, then
0

0

there must be k00 ∈ K n0 such that L f0 k0 > 0, which implies pk0 αk0 Â f0 k0 = maxk∈K+ { pk α f0 k Â f0 k }. Let

gether with pk0 αk0 Â f0 k0 = maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f0 k }, this implies pk0 αk0 Â f0 k0 = maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f0 k },
which establishes Property (i ). To establish Property (ii ), it suffices to show that if there exist
f 0 ∈ F and k0 ∈ K + such that L f0 k0 − L0 f0 k0 6= 0, then pk0 αk0 Â f0 k0 = maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f k }. To
do so note that L f0 k0 − L0 f0 k0 6= 0 implies that either L f0 k0 > 0 or L0 f0 k0 > 0. If L f0 k0 > 0, then
pk0 αk0 Â f0 k0 = maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f k } follows from the profit maximization condition (2). If L0 f0 k0 > 0,
then pk0 αk0 Â f0 k0 = maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f k } follows from Property (i ), which concludes the proof of
Lemma 2.
Let us now introduce the following stronger version of Restriction R1.
R1’. For any N ≥ 2, there does not exist a sequence {k n }n=1,...,N +1 ∈ Kit+ and a sequence { f n }n=1,...,N ∈

Fi such that (i ) k1 = k N +1 and k n 6= k n0 for all n0 6= n, n 6= 1, n0 6= 1; (ii ) f 1 6= f N and
f 1 k1
f N k1
f n 6= f n+1 for all n; and (iii ) measured productivity in local market i satisfies Âi2011
6= Âi2011
and
fn kn
f n k n +1
N
∏n=1 Âi2011 / Âi2011 = 1.
Using Lemma 2, the next lemma establishes that under Restriction R1’, all elements of L̃(α, X )
lead to the same aggregate land allocation across crops.
Lemma 3. For any α ∈ A+ and any X ∈ X satisfying Restriction R1’, if L, L0 ∈ L̃(α, X ), then
∑ f ∈F L f k = ∑ f ∈F L0 f k for all k ∈ K + .
Proof. We proceed by contradiction. Suppose that there exist L, L0 ∈ L̃(α, X ) such that ∑ f ∈F L f k 6=
∑ f ∈F L0 f k for some k ∈ K + . By Lemma 1, we know that there exist vectors of prices, ( p, r ) and

38

( p0 , r 0 ), such that ( L, p, r ) and ( L0 , p0 , r 0 ) are competitive equilibria. Let ∆L ≡ L − L0 . It must satisfy
the two following properties.
Property 1: If there exist f ∈ F and k ∈ K + such that ∆L f k 6= 0, then there exists k0 6= k ∈ K + such
0

that ∆L f k 6= 0.
Property 1 derives from the fact that if L, L0 ∈ L̃(α, X ), then we must have ∑k∈K+ L f k =
∑k∈K+ L0 f k = V̂f for all f ∈ F .
Property 2: If there exist f ∈ F and k ∈ K + such that ∆L f k 6= 0, then there exists f 0 6= f in F such that
∆L f

0k

6= 0.

Property 2 derives from the fact that if L, L0 ∈ L̃(α, X ), then we must have ∑ f ∈F A f k L f k =
∑ f ∈F A f k L0 f k for all k ∈ K + .
The rest of the proof of Lemma 3 proceeds as follows. Since L 6= L0 , there exist k1 ∈ K + and
f 1 ∈ F such that ∆L f1 k1 6= 0. This further implies the existence of k2 6= k1 such that ∆L f1 k2 6= 0,
by Property 1, and the existence of f 2 6= f 1 such that and ∆L f2 k2 6= 0, by Property 2. By iteration,
we can therefore construct an infinite sequence of goods {k n }n≥1 and an infinite sequence of fields

{ f n }n≥1 such that k n+1 6= k n and f n+1 6= f n . Since the number of goods in K + is finite, there must
be M < N such that k n 6= k n0 for all n 6= n0 , n,n0 ∈ { M, ..., N } but k M = k N +1 . By construction, this
subsequence is such that ∆L f n kn 6= 0 and ∆L f n kn+1 6= 0 for all n ∈ { M, ..., N }. Since L, L0 ∈ L̃(α, X ),
we must have ∑ f ∈F αk Â f k L f k = ∑ f ∈F αk Â f k L0 f k and, in turn, ∑ f ∈F L f k = ∑ f ∈F L0 f k for all k ∈ K + .
Thus Property (ii ) in Lemma 2 implies

By equations (31) and (32), we have therefore constructed a sequence of goods and fields {k M , ..., k N +1 }
and { f M , ..., f N } such that (i ) k M = k N +1 and k n 6= k n0 for all n0 6= n, n 6= M, n0 6= M; (ii ) f n 6= f n+1
for all n; and (iii ) measured productivity satisfies

Â f n kn

∏n= M Â f k +

There are two possible cases.
Case 1: There exists n0 ∈ { M, ..., N − 1} such that Â f n0 kn0 +1 6= Â f n0 +1 kn0 +1 .

39

(33)

In this case we can rearrange equation (33) as

If f M 6= f N , {k n0 +1 , k n0 +2 , ..., k N , k M , ..., k n0 } and { f n0 +1 , f n0 +2 ..., f N , f M , ..., f n0 } violate R1’. If f M =
f N , then Â f N k N +1 = Â f M k M . Thus {k n0 +1 , k n0 +2 , ..., k N , k M+1 , ..., k n0 } and { f n0 +1 , f n0 +2 ..., f N , f M+1 , ..., f n0 }
violate R1’.
Case 2: Â f n kn+1 = Â f n+1 kn+1 for all n ∈ { M, ..., N − 1}.
In this case starting from L1 ≡ L0 , we construct a new allocation L2 as follows. Without loss of
f kM

generality, assume that L f M k M − L1M

< 0. Thus the same arguments used to establish Property
f k
1 and Property 2 imply that {k M , ..., k N +1 } and { f M , ..., f N } are such that L f n kn − L1n n < 0 and
f k
L f n kn+1 − L1n n+1 > 0 for all n ∈ { M, ..., N }. We set L2 such that

By construction the new allocation L2 satisfies Constraints (29) and (30). Furthermore, L2 satisfies

∑ f ∈F L0 f k , for all k ∈ K,
∑ f ∈F A f k L0 f k , for all k ∈ K,

(34)
(35)

where the second equality uses Â f n kn+1 = Â f n+1 kn+1 for all n ∈ { M, ..., N − 1}. Since L2 satisfies
Constraints (29) and (30), equation (35) implies L2 ∈ L̃(α, X ).
Starting from L2 , we can therefore follow the same procedure as above to create a new sequence of goods and fields satisfying conditions (i ) and (ii ) as well as equation (33). Either the
new sequence falls into Case 1, which violates R1’, or it falls into Case 2, in which case we can
construct L3 ∈ L̃(α, X ) satisfying equation (34) in the exact same way we have just constructed
L2 . We can iterate the following process. Since after each iteration j ≥ 1, there is one less fieldgood pair ( f , k ) such that L − L j 6= 0, there must be a sequence that falls into Case 1 after a finite
number of iterations. Otherwise, given the finite number of fields and goods, there would be an
allocation L j satisfying equation (34) such that L j = L, which contradicts ∑ f ∈F L f k 6= ∑ f ∈F L0 f k
for some k ∈ K + . Thus R1’ must be violated, which concludes the proof of Lemma 3.
For all α ∈ A+ , all X ∈ X satisfying Restriction R1’, and all k ∈ K + , let L̃k (α, X ) ≡ ∑ f ∈F L f k for

40

all L ∈ L̃(α, X ). By Lemma 3 L̃k (α, X ) is well-defined. The next lemma shows that ( L̃k (·, X ))k∈K+
has the gross substitute property.
Lemma 4. For any X ∈ X satisfying Restriction R1’, if α, α0 ∈ A+ are such that α0k0 > αk0 for some
k0 ∈ K + and α0k = αk for all k 6= k0 in K + , then L̃k (α0 , X ) > L̃k (α, X ) for all k 6= k0 in K + .
Proof. Take α ∈ A+ . Consider a sequence of productivity shocks (αn )n≥0 ∈ A+ such that αkn0 > αk0
for some k0 ∈ K + , α0nk = αk for all k 6= k0 in K + , and limn→∞ αkn0 = αk0 and a sequence of land
allocations ( Ln )n≥0 such that Ln ∈ L̃(αn , X ) for all n and limn→∞ Ln → L. By the definition of

L̃(α, X ) and the Maximum Theorem, L̃(·, X ) is upper hemi-continuous. Thus L ∈ L̃(α, X ). We
fk
will first establish that if n is large enough, then ∑ f ∈F Ln > ∑ f ∈F L f k for all k 6= k0 in K + .

where we have used the fact that ∑ f ∈F αk Â f k L f k = ∑ f ∈F αk Â f k L f k . Since L ∈ L̃(α, X ), inequality

f k
the existence of ( f 1 , k1 ) such that L̃n1 1 > 0 and L f1 k1 = 0. By construction of L̃n , this further
requires f 1 = f (k1 ). Since k1 ∈ K + , we know that there exists f 6= f 1 = f (k1 ) such that L f k1 > 0.

Now starting from L, consider the following reallocation. Take ε ∈

field f from good k1 and reallocate them uniformly to all other goods in K + . Since L f1 k0 > 0,
L f k1 > 0 and inequality (45) holds, such a reallocation is feasible. Furthermore, the change in
the output of good k0 is equal to − Â f1 k0 ε + η Â f k0 > 0; the change in the output of good k1 is
equal to Â f1 k1 ε − η Â f k1 > 0; and the change in all other goods is strictly positive. This contradicts
L ∈ L̃(α, X ).
At this point we have shown that there exists N > 0 such that if n > N, then L̃n = Ln . By

fk

construction, we have ∑ f ∈F L̃n > ∑ f ∈F L f k for all k ∈ K + , k 6= k0 . Thus we have established
fk
that if n is large enough, then ∑ f ∈F Ln > ∑ f ∈F L f k for all k 6= k0 in K + . Now take α, α0 ∈ A+
such that α0k0 > αk0 for some k0 ∈ K + and α0k = αk for all k 6= k0 in K + . The previous result
implies that if α0k0 − αk0 is small enough, then for any L0 ∈ L̃(α0 , X ) and L ∈ L̃(α, X ), we must
have ∑ f ∈F L0 f k > ∑ f ∈F L f k for all k 6= k0 in K + . To see this note that if this were not the case,
we could construct a sequence (αn )n≥0 satisfying αkn0 > αk0 for some k0 ∈ K + , α0nk = αk for all
k 6= k0 in K + , and limn→∞ αkn0 = αk0 and a subsequence of the land allocations ( Ln )n≥0 satisfying
Ln ∈ L̃(αn , X ) that converges to L00 ∈ L̃(α, X ) such that for all n, there exists some k 6= k0 in K +
such that

∑ f ∈F Ln

(46)

By Lemma 3 we know that ∑ f ∈F L f k = ∑ f ∈F L00 f k for all k ∈ K + since L, L00 ∈ L̃(α, X ). Thus infk
equality (46) implies ∑ f ∈F Ln ≤ ∑ f ∈F L00 f k , which contradicts our previous result. Thus Lemma
4 holds for α0k0 − αk0 small enough. Since this is true for any initial value of α, Lemma 4 must hold
for large changes as well.
Using the fact that the gross substitute property holds, one can establish the uniqueness, up
to a normalization, of the vector of productivity shocks for goods in K + such that L ∈ L̃(α, X )
matches the observed land allocation.
Lemma 5. For any X ∈ X satisfying Restriction R1’, there exists at most one vector αk

to a normalization, such that
L̃k (α, X ) = L̂k for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1} .

(47)

Proof. In order to establish Lemma 5, it is sufficient to show that if L̃k (α, X ) = L̃k (α0 , X ) for all
k ∈ K + / {K + 1}, then there must be µ > 0 such that αk = µα0k for all k ∈ K + . Note that since
L̃(α, X ) is the set of solutions of (27), the two following properties must hold. First, L̃k (·, X ) is
homogeneous of degree zero for all all k ∈ K + . Second, using the fact that ∑k∈K+ ∑ f ∈F L f k =
∑ f ∈F V̂ f if L ∈ L̃(α, X ) or L̃(α0 , X ), we must also have L̃K+1 (α, X ) = L̃K+1 (α0 , X ). The rest of the
argument is the same as the one used to establish the uniqueness of a Walrasian equilibrium in
an endowment economy; see Proposition 17.F.3 in Mas-Colell, Whinston and Green (1995). One
can proceed by contradiction. Suppose that there exist α and α0 such that L̃k (α, X ) = L̃k (α0 , X )
for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}, but there does not exist µ > 0 such that αk = µα0k for all k ∈ K + .
Since L̃k (·, X ) is homogeneous of degree zero for all all k ∈ K + and L̃K+1 (α, X ) = L̃K+1 (α0 , X ), we

must have α00 such that (i ) L̃k (α00 , X ) = L̃k (α, X ) for all k ∈ K + and (ii ) α00k k∈K+ 6= αk k∈K+ ,
α00k ≥ αk for all k ∈ K + , and α00k0 = αk0 for some k0 ∈ K + . Now consider lowering α00 to obtain
α in K + − 1 steps, lowering (or keeping unaltered) the productivity shock associated with each
good k 6= k0 ∈ K + one at a time. By Lemma 4 and property (ii ), the excess demand for good k0

never increases and strictly decreases in at least one step since α00k k∈K∗ 6= αk k∈K∗ . This implies

L̃k0 (α, X ) < L̃k0 (α00 , X ), which contradicts property (i ).

Proof of Theorem 2

We are now ready to establish Theorem 2, which is restated below for expositional purposes.
Theorem 2. Suppose that an observation X ∈ X , an admissible vector (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + , and the
associated competitive allocation L ∈ L (α, X ) satisfy the two following restrictions.
R1. For any N ≥ 2, there does not exist {k n }n=1,...,N +1 ∈ K + and { f n }n=1,...,N ∈ F such that (i )

Then any admissible vector (α0 , p0 ) ∈ A+ × P + satisfies α0k , p0k = αk , pk for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}.

Furthermore, pk k∈K+ /{K+1} is uniquely determined by equation (11) and pk /pk = αk Â f k /αk Â f k , for
0

all k,k0 ∈ K + / {K + 1} and f ∈ F such that L f k , L f k > 0.
Proof. We proceed in four steps.
Step 1: For any α ∈ A+ and any X ∈ X , if L ∈ L(α, X ), then L ∈ L̃(α̃, X ), where α̃ ∈ A+ is such that:

(i ) α̃k = αk if k ∈
/ K + ; (ii ) α̃k = αk / Q̂k if k ∈ K + / {K + 1}; and (iii ) α̃K+1 = 1/ ∑ f ∈F Â f K+1 L f K+1 .
Consider L ∈ L(α, X ). Suppose that α̃ ∈ A+ satisfies properties (i )-(iii ), then L ∈ L(α, X )
implies that L satisfies Constraints (28)-(30) when productivity shocks are set to α̃. Now consider
an allocation L0 ∈ L̃(α̃, X ). Suppose, by contradiction, that

∑ f ∈F α̃K+1 Â f K+1 L0 f K+1 > ∑ f ∈F α̃K+1 Â f K+1 L f K+1 = 1.

(48)

Since Constraint (28) must hold as an equality at a solution of (27), we therefore have ∑ f ∈F α̃k Â f k L f k >
1 for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}. Thus L0 also satisfies all constraints in ( P). Since inequality (48) implies
∑ f ∈F αK+1 Â f K+1 L0 f K+1 > ∑ f ∈F αK+1 Â f K+1 L f K+1 , this contradicts L ∈ L(α, X ).
Step 2: For any X ∈ X satisfying Restriction R1’, if (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + is admissible, then any admissible
vector (α0 , p0 ) ∈ A+ × P + satisfies α0k = αk for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}.
We proceed by contradiction. Suppose that there exist two admissible vectors (α, p) and

(α0 , p0 )

∈ A+ × P + such that α0k 6= αk for some k ∈ K + / {K + 1}. By Theorem 1, α and α0 ∈ A+
are such that

∑ f ∈F L f k
∑ f ∈F L0 f k

= L̂k for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1} ,

(49)

= L̂k for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1} ,

(50)

where L ∈ L (α, X ) and L0 ∈ L (α0 , X ), respectively. By Step 1, we know that L ∈ L̃ (α̃, X )
with α̃ such that: (i ) α̃k = αk if k ∈
/ K + ; (ii ) α̃k = αk / Q̂k if k ∈ K + / {K + 1}; and (iii ) α̃K+1 =
1/ ∑ f ∈F Â f K+1 L f K+1 ; and similarly that L0 ∈ L̃ (α̃0 , X ) with α̃0 such that: (i ) α̃0k = α0k if k ∈
/ K+ ;

(ii ) α̃0k = α0k / Q̂k if k ∈ K + / {K + 1}; and (iii ) α̃0K+1 = 1/ ∑ f ∈F Â f K+1 L f K+1 . As argued in the
proof of Lemma 5 above, if equations (49) and (50) hold, then ∑ f ∈F L f K+1 = ∑ f ∈F L0 f K+1 , which
implies α̃K+1 = α̃0K+1 . To summarize, we have constructed L ∈ L̃(α̃, X ) and L0 ∈ L̃(α̃0 , X ) satisfying equations (49) and (50) with α̃ and α̃0 ∈ A+ such that α̃0 6= α̃k for some k ∈ K + / {K + 1} and
α̃0K+1 = α̃K+1 , which contradicts Lemma 5.
Step 3: Suppose that an observation X ∈ X , an admissible vector (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + , and the associated
competitive allocation L ∈ L (α, X ) satisfy Restriction R1, then any admissible vector (α0 , p0 ) ∈ A+ × P +
satisfies α0k = αk for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}.
Consider two admissible vectors (α, p) and (α0 , p0 ), with L and L0 the associated competitive
allocations, respectively. Let us construct fictitious productivity levels ( Ã f k ) f ∈F ,k∈K such that
Ã f k = Â f k if k ∈ arg maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f k } and Ã f k = 0 otherwise. By construction, (α, p) remains
an admissible vector for the economy characterized by fictitious productivity levels ( Ã f k ) f ∈F ,k∈K .
In addition, since X and (α, p) satisfy Restriction R1, X satisfies Restriction R1’ for the economy
characterized by fictitious productivity levels ( Ã f k ) f ∈F ,k∈K . Finally, by Lemma 2 Property (i ), we
know that if k ∈
/ arg maxk∈K+ { pk αk Â f k }, then L0 f k = 0. Thus (α0 , p0 ) also remains an admissible
vector for the economy characterized by fictitious productivity levels ( Ã f k ) f ∈F ,k∈K . By Step 2, the
three previous observations imply that α0k = αk for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}.
Step 4: Suppose that an observation X ∈ X , an admissible vector (α, p) ∈ A+ × P + , and the associated
competitive allocation L ∈ L (α, X ) satisfy Restrictions R1 and R2, then any admissible vector (α0 , p0 ) ∈

A+ × P + satisfies p0k = pk for all k ∈ K + / {K + 1}. Furthermore, pk k∈K+ /{K+1} is given by the
