ABSTRACT
We study the dynamics of residential electricity demand by exploiting a natural experiment that
produced large and long-lasting price changes in over 250 Illinois communities. Using a flexible
difference-in-differences matching approach, we estimate that the price elasticity of demand
grows from –0:09 in the first six months to –0:27 two years later. We also estimate a more
sophisticated model in which usage is a function of past and future prices, and we find similar
elasticity patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for consumption
dynamics when evaluating energy policy.

Economic theory suggests that demand is typically more elastic in the long run relative
to the short run. When consumption depends on goods that are durable or habit-forming,
consumers may take years to respond fully to a price change (Topel and Rosen, 1988;
Becker et al., 1994). These dynamics pose several challenges to demand estimation. In any
period, consumption may depend upon both current and past prices, and, when consumers
are forward looking, also upon future prices. When prices fluctuate, as they typically do,
the demand response will reflect a mix of both short-term and long-term changes in consumption. Finally, unless one accepts restrictive functional form assumptions, unbiased estimation requires a source of exogenous price variation large enough to produce detectable
effects in long-run behavior. Quantifying these demand-side dynamics is important in the
electricity sector, where suppliers, market regulators, and policymakers make decisions
with long-run ramifications.
We estimate how the price elasticity of electricity demand evolves over time by exploiting an Illinois policy that generated plausibly exogenous shocks to residential electricity
prices in over 250 communities. Because these price shocks are large and lasted over two
years, we are able to estimate the demand response more flexibly and over a longer period
than prior quasi-experimental studies. We show that residential electricity consumers take
multiple years to adjust to price changes. Our event study finds an elasticity of −0.27 in
the period 25–30 months after the policy change, almost three times the magnitude of the
elasticity in the first six months (−0.09).
Our monthly consumption and price data span 2007–2014 and come from the largest
utility in Illinois, ComEd, whose territory encompassed approximately 70 percent of residential consumers in the state. During this period, Illinois implemented a municipal aggregation program.1 The program allowed individual communities to select new electricity
suppliers on behalf of their residents with the approval of a local referendum. This policy change resulted in large, long-lasting price changes for communities that implemented
aggregation. Our setting provides a clean natural experiment: aggregation customers continued to receive their electricity bill from the utility in the same format as before, so the
price variation in our analysis is not confounded with other billing changes. Additionally,
Illinois employs a linear price schedule for residential electricity, consisting of a modest
fixed fee and a constant marginal price. With rare and short-lived exceptions, aggregation
affected only the marginal price of electricity, greatly simplifying our analysis.
1

In other settings, these programs are sometimes called “community choice aggregation.” Aggregation is
also available in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Rhode Island.

Our empirical approach combines a difference-in-differences methodology with the
matching estimator developed by Abadie and Imbens (2006, 2011). Matching estimators
are particularly well-suited to our study because electricity usage is highly seasonal, and
these seasonal patterns vary substantially across different communities and over time. The
relatively large number of ComEd communities that did not pass a referendum on aggregation (479 in our sample of 768) in combination with a lengthy pre-period provides an
excellent empirical setting for a matching estimator. We find that our matching estimator
obtains more precise estimates than a traditional regression. We view our application as
a useful demonstration of matching for applied researchers, in the vein of Fowlie et al.
(2012). In contrast to their paper, we conduct inference using subsampling, which allows
for a richer space of estimators whose distributions do not have pre-existing formulas.
Our estimator matches each aggregation community to five “nearest neighbors” that did
not pass a referendum on aggregation.2 We construct the matching criteria using communities’ monthly electricity usage profiles from 2008 and 2009. This matching period long
precedes our natural experiment: more than ninety percent of the referenda in our sample
are held after February 2012, over two years later. Our identifying assumption is that the
average observed differences in usage between aggregation communities and their matched
controls in the post period are caused only by aggregation. In support of this assumption,
we document that usage patterns between aggregation communities and matched controls
are parallel after the matching period but prior to the referenda. Because we observe usage at a high (monthly) frequency and community referenda occur only during infrequent
statewide elections, our finding of no effect in the months immediately preceding the referenda suggests that communities did not select into aggregation based on expected usage
changes. Whether or not a community pursued aggregation was likely influenced by social and political factors, including loyalty to the utility and trust in the local government.
To the best of our knowledge, expected future usage was not discussed when considering
aggregation. In light of these factors and the absence of pre-trends, aggregation therefore
provides plausibly exogenous price variation in our sample.
We find that prices fell by 24 percent and usage increased by 6.1 percent by the end of
the first year following an aggregation referendum, relative to control communities that did
not pass a referendum on aggregation. At the beginning of the second year, the expiration of

As a robustness check, we also estimate a traditional difference-in-differences regression model without
matching, using only communities that implemented aggregation. These results, presented in the Appendix,
are similar.

a long-term ComEd contract caused a price decrease and an accompanying usage increase
in control communities. Nevertheless, during our estimation period, the estimated price
elasticity declines smoothly from −0.09 in the first six months to −0.27 two years later,
illustrating the importance of long-run dynamics in this setting.
Although they are long-lasting, the relative price decreases in our sample are not constant over time. Thus, the estimates above reflect a mix of both short-run and longer-run
responses. To address this shortcoming, we also estimate a dynamic model of demand
in which usage is a flexible function of past, current, and future prices. As before, our
identifying variation comes only from price differences caused by aggregation. Using this
model, we estimate an elasticity of −0.08 in the first six months following a price change
and an elasticity of −0.21 19–24 months after a price change. Accounting for the fact that
the median community implements a price change four months after a referendum, we conclude that the patterns estimated by the more flexible dynamic model are similar to those
from the reduced-form approach described above. Finally, we employ a parametric formulation of the dynamic model to forecast that the long-run elasticity converges to −0.35 after
approximately 10 years.
Our results have significant implications for energy policy. Generators and distributors require forecasts of the long-run demand response to price changes to invest optimally
in capacity and infrastructure. Likewise, market regulators require these forecasts to design efficient allocation mechanisms and renewable energy subsidies. Utilizing a short-run
elasticity will lead to an underestimate of the longer-run demand response. Using simple
back-of-the-envelope calculations, we show that predicted quantity reductions following
the imposition of a carbon tax are 2.3–2.9 times larger when using the two-year price elasticity of demand compared to using the six-month elasticity, depending on the elasticity
of supply. This difference implies that the carbon tax required to reduce emissions by one
percent is 56–65 percent smaller. Although our exact estimates may not directly translate
to other settings, the relative magnitudes of the short- and longer-run elasticities suggest
that other energy policies can cause a substantially larger usage response in the long run
than in the short run.
The existing electricity demand literature relies on state-level data and dynamic panel
models to estimate consumption dynamics over a longer period. The long-run elasticity
estimates vary widely, from −0.3 to about −1.1 (e.g., Kamerschen and Porter, 2004; Dergiades and Tsoulfidis, 2008; Alberini and Filippini, 2011), and none of these estimates is

3

based on quasi-experimental variation.3 Consistency in these models generally requires
strong assumptions about the form of serial correlation, and the estimates are particularly
sensitive to the exact specification used (Alberini and Filippini, 2011). Conversely, our approach makes relatively few assumptions and is substantially more flexible than what has
been done previously.
Papers outside of the dynamic panel literature typically estimate only short-run or static
price elasticities.4 Ito (2014) uses quasi-experimental variation by comparing households
located near a boundary between two California utilities, which vary in when and by how
much they change prices. He estimates an average price elasticity of −0.09 in the first 4
months following a price change, which is similar in magnitude to our six-month estimate.
Reiss and White (2005) employ cross-sectional data from California and a structural model
that exploits the non-linearity of the electricity price schedule. They estimate an average
(static) price elasticity of −0.39, but do not investigate how it evolves following a price
change.5 Our findings demonstrate the importance of such dynamics with respect to the
price of electricity: residential electricity consumers are more than twice as responsive in
the longer run relative to the short run.
A few recent papers estimate consumption dynamics in response to non-price interventions or in other contexts. Allcott and Rogers (2014) estimate that the energy reductions
following random assignment of a home energy report are larger 7–12 months after the
beginning of the program, relative to 1–6 months after. On the other hand, Ito (2015) finds
that the one-year and three-year effects of an appliance rebate program are similar, suggesting that not every policy induces dynamics of the kind we find in our study. In the context
of borrowing, Karlan and Zinman (2018) find that the elasticity with respect to the interest
rate nearly triples over time, from −1.1 in the first year to −2.9 in the third year.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section I discusses the electricity market
3

See Alberini and Filippini (2011) for a review of this literature. Some have argued that a state’s average
price of electricity is exogenous because it is regulated (Paul et al., 2009) or because the unregulated component is driven by national trends (Bernstein and Griffin, 2005). However, electricity rates may be set based
on the anticipated cost of electricity to suppliers and that cost, in turn, may be based on anticipated demand.
Therefore, it is not possible to separate supply-side variation stemming from national changes in fuel prices
from demand-side variation without explicitly constructing instruments, and we are not aware of any papers
that employ instruments to estimate a longer-run price elasticity.

A growing literature investigates the impact of real-time pricing (e.g., Wolak, 2011; Allcott, 2011; Jessoe
and Rapson, 2014). The elasticity we identify here is fundamentally different from the elasticity estimated in
the real-time pricing literature, which reflects intra-day substitution patterns as well as any overall reductions
in electricity consumption.

Section V then extends to a dynamic framework. Section VI discusses the implications of
our main results, and Section VII concludes.

I

The Illinois Electricity Market

The provision of electricity to residential customers consists of two components: supply and distribution. Suppliers generate or procure electricity and distributors provide
the infrastructure to deliver it and often handle billing. Illinois has two regulated electricity distributors: Commonwealth Edison Co. (“ComEd”) and Ameren Illinois Utilities
(“Ameren”). Prior to 1997, they owned generating units as well as the distribution network. In 1997, the passage of the Consumer Choice Act allowed for competitive supply
in the market, due to widespread agreement that, unlike distribution, electricity generation
is not a natural monopoly (Illinois General Assembly, 1997). As part of the deregulation
measures, the two utilities were encouraged to divest their generation assets. These policies
led to the entry of several alternative suppliers into the market.
Customers are assigned their distributor on the basis of geographic location. ComEd,
the distributor for whom we have usage data, serves northern Illinois, where approximately
70 percent of the state’s residents live. The supply price component of electricity delivered by Ameren or ComEd is, by law, equal to their procurement cost and does not vary
geographically.6 While customers have no choice in distributors, in 2002 residential and
small commercial customers gained the ability to choose an alternative retail electric supplier (ARES) who would be responsible for supplying (but not delivering) their electricity.7
However, the residential ARES market was practically nonexistent between 2002 and 2005.
This was blamed on barriers to competition and a rate freeze that kept the default utility rate
low. In 2006, the state removed some of these barriers and instituted a discount program
for switchers, but this still had little effect on behavior. By 2009, only 234 residential customers had switched suppliers. By contrast, 71,000 small commercial, large commercial,
and industrial customers had switched (Spark Energy, 2011).
Motivated by these patterns, the Illinois Power Agency Act was amended in 2009
to allow for municipal aggregation, whereby municipalities and counties could negotiate

the purchase of electricity on behalf of their residential and small commercial customers.
Townships gained this ability in 2012. To ensure that individual consumers retained the
ability to choose their supplier, the amendment required municipalities to allow individuals
to opt out of aggregation.
To implement an opt-out aggregation program, a municipality had to publicize the proposal, hold a town hall meeting to educate the community, register the proposed aggregation program with the state, and hold a referendum. Referenda dates followed the state
electoral calendar: they were held in March or November in even years and in April in odd
years. The wording of the referendum question was specified in the Illinois Power Agency
Act and is reproduced in Section 1 of the Appendix. In most cases where the referendum
was approved, multiple suppliers submitted bids for predetermined contract lengths (e.g.,
one-, two-, and three-year contracts). In other cases, the municipality negotiated directly
with a supplier. The two main ways in which suppliers differentiated themselves were price
and the share of generation from renewable sources. Nearly all communities selected the
supplier with the lowest price, although environmental preferences occasionally induced
communities to select a more expensive one.
When determining the bid or negotiating directly, each supplier obtained communitylevel usage data from the distributor. These usage data, along with electricity futures, were
the main factors in each offered price.8 Importantly, our analysis employs the same usage
data, which reduces the likelihood that price changes are affected by confounding factors
that are unobservable to us. Because many of communities’ first contracts were in effect
through the end of our usage data, the price variation we employ comes mainly from the
first set of aggregation contracts in Illinois.
Overall, municipal aggregation was popular in Illinois. Of the roughly 2,100 communities in the ComEd and Ameren service territories, 741 had voted to implement aggregation
as of March 2016. In our setting, the realized savings from aggregation came largely from
the timing of the program. During our sample period, alternative suppliers were able to
offer lower rates due to the unexpected boom in shale gas, while ComEd was locked into a
long-term high-price procurement contract.
Customers in a community that passed an aggregation referendum were automatically
switched to the newly chosen electricity supplier unless they opted out by mailing in a

Suppliers may have also based their bids on the number of electric space heat customers, which we do
not observe. In Illinois, only about 10 percent of households heat their homes with electricity (U.S. Energy
Information Administration, 2009).

card, calling, or filling out a form online.9 Aggregation officially began at the conclusion
of the opt-out process. From the consumer’s point of view, the only visible change was the
supply price of electricity on her bill, which was still issued by the incumbent distributor
(Ameren or ComEd). The design of the bill, as well as the value of the non-supply prices,
remained identical for all customers in the distributor’s territory regardless of aggregation.
Conveniently, this means that the price effects of aggregation were not confounded with
changes in a bill’s appearance. Figures A.1–A.4 in the Appendix display a sample letter
notifying households of aggregation, a sample opt-out card, and a sample ComEd bill.
Our estimation approach assumes that municipal aggregation was not accompanied by
other programs that could also affect electricity usage. A careful review of news articles,
aggregation-related announcements, and other online materials did not turn up any evidence
contradicting this assumption. ComEd runs several energy-related rebate and discount programs, but these were offered uniformly to all communities in its service territory during
our sample period (with the exception of small pilot programs, which are typically conducted in communities near ComEd’s headquarters in Chicago). Moreover, ComEd does
not have a strong profit incentive to target its rebate and discount programs to aggregation or non-aggregation communities. By law, ComEd makes zero profits from electricity
supply. Instead, its profits come from distributing electricity, and ComEd remained the
distributor in all the aggregation communities in our sample.

Data

We obtained electricity usage data directly from ComEd. The data contain monthly residential electricity usage at the municipality level for ComEd’s 887 service territories from
February 2007 through June 2014. We drop 108 communities that were missing data, did
not appear to have consistent geographic boundaries during our sample period, or could
not be assigned an aggregation status with confidence. For our main analysis, we also drop
an additional 11 communities that passed a referendum approving aggregation but never
implemented the program. The resulting dataset is a balanced panel of monthly electricity
9

While we do not have an exact number, ComEd and several energy suppliers have told us that the optout rate was low. Community-specific opt-out rates mentioned in newspapers range from 3 to 10 percent
(e.g., Lotus, 2011; Wade, 2012; Ford, 2013). The number of non-aggregated customers did, however, grow
slowly over time because new residents who moved to an aggregation community were not defaulted into the
aggregation program. The few residential customers who had already opted into an ARES or into real-time
pricing prior to aggregation were not switched over to the chosen supplier.

usage for 768 ComEd communities.10
We constructed the time series of ComEd electricity rates using ComEd ratebooks obtained from the Illinois Commerce Commission. Prior to June of 2013, customers with
electric space heating faced a lower rate than those with non-electric space heating. Because only about 10 percent of households in Illinois heat their homes with electricity (U.S.
Energy Information Administration, 2009), we assume that the incumbent rate was equal to
the non-electric space heating rate, which was true for the majority of non-aggregation customers. Data on aggregation referenda dates, aggregation supply prices, and aggregation
implementation dates were obtained from a variety of sources, including PlugInIllinois,
websites of electricity suppliers, and municipal officials. We describe these sources in
further detail in Section 2 of the Appendix.
As shown in Table 1, 300 communities in the ComEd territory passed a referendum
on aggregation during our sample period, and 289 of those communities eventually implemented an aggregation program. In addition, 36 communities voted on, but did not pass,
the referendum.11 The geographic locations of the 768 aggregation and non-aggregation
communities in our sample are displayed in Figure 1. Aggregation communities are welldispersed throughout the ComEd territory but are slightly more prevalent in the greater
Chicago area.
Our discussions with industry participants suggest that social and political factors, such
as whether the local government should involve itself in negotiating electricity prices,

See Section 2 of the Appendix for additional data details. Ameren, the other distributor in Illinois,
declined our data request.
11
We investigated the possibility of employing a regression discontinuity approach based on the fraction
voting “yes” or “no”, but we do not have enough power. There are only 20 communities where the referendum
failed by less than five percentage points.

played a role in a community’s decision to hold a referendum. To the best of our knowledge,
changes in expected future usage were not a consideration.12 Anecdotally, the reasons why
some communities voted against aggregation include: (1) lack of trust in the local government to secure savings relative to the incumbent; (2) loyalty to the utility; (3) concern about
the environmental impact of the resulting electricity use increase; (4) a misunderstanding
about the opt-out provision; and (5) the belief that choosing an electricity provider for
residents was not an appropriate government function.
There is some variation in how long communities take to implement price changes after approving aggregation. The median length of time between passage of the aggregation
referendum and commencement of the aggregation program is 4 months. At least 10 percent of aggregation communities switched suppliers within 3 months of the referendum,
whereas 10 percent had not done so 6 months afterward. For our reduced-form results,
we construct estimates relative to the referendum date to capture any usage response that
occurred prior to the actual price change.
Many states employ a “block pricing” schedule where the marginal price of electricity
increases with quantity purchased. Illinois, by contrast, employs a constant marginal price
and a moderate fixed fee, which simplifies our analysis because it reduces confusion over
12

Our understanding of the motivations behind aggregation is guided by local news articles, local government meeting minutes, in-person discussions with ComEd and the Illinois Commerce Commission (Illinois’
electricity regulator), and phone conversations with industry participants.

the “price” to which consumers might be responding. This constant marginal price can be
broken down into three main components: supply, delivery, and taxes/fees. Implementing
aggregation entails a community signing a contract with a supplier for a particular supply
rate (the largest component of the marginal price); delivery charges and other fees remain
the same. Non-aggregation communities pay the default ComEd supply rate. Thus, aggregation only affects the marginal price of electricity. Nearly all suppliers offered contracts
with a constant supply rate, with most terms ranging from 9 months to 3 years.
Figure 2 demonstrates the price variation in our sample. The thick dashed line and thin
green line in panel (a) display ComEd’s monthly supply rate and the total of all other usage
rates, respectively, during and after our sample period. ComEd’s supply rate decreased significantly in 2013, when its long-term high-priced power contract expired. We discuss the
implications of this shock for the interpretation of our estimates in Section IV. In response
to this price drop, several communities switched back to ComEd when their aggregation
contracts expired in June of 2014. This reversal is visible in the black dashed line, which
displays the count of aggregation communities over time.
The thick blue line in panel (a) shows the average monthly supply rate for aggrega10

tion communities, starting from when the first community implemented aggregation (June
2011). During our sample period (2008–2014), the average aggregation supply rate is
always lower than the default ComEd supply rate, although the two rates converge in mid2015. We also note that the month-to-month variation in the ComEd rate is small relative
to the level shocks brought about by aggregation and the June 2013 ComEd contract expiration.
Another way to visualize the price variation in our sample is to plot the mean residential
electricity prices for aggregation communities relative to the referendum date (panel (b) of
Figure 2). The displayed price combines the supply rate with the other usage charges
from panel (a). For comparison, we also show the mean contemporaneous ComEd rate.
The figure illustrates the two large price reductions during the time period spanned by our
sample. Averaging the price changes along the x-axis, we observe a 25 percent reduction
for communities upon implementation, and a 10 percent reduction for non-aggregation
communities about 15 months after the average date of a successful referendum, reflecting
the June 2013 drop in the ComEd supply price. There was also significant cross-sectional
variation in the aggregation price shocks (see Figure A.5 in the Appendix), but, for nearly
all communities in nearly every month, aggregation reduced prices.
Variation in aggregation prices is due to differences in (i) the timing of the referenda; (ii)
community procurement strategies; and (iii) the load profiles of the communities. This last
source of variation raises the concern that suppliers might have charged different prices
to communities with different expected future usage. Our estimation approach mitigates
this issue because it matches aggregation communities to their non-aggregation controls
based on the same community-level usage data that suppliers used to determine prices.
Furthermore, we investigate the potential for price endogeneity by estimating elasticities
separately by percentiles of the realized price change, and we find no relationship (see
Section IV.B).13
Both the aggregation-driven price changes and the 2013 drop in the ComEd price were
likely more salient to customers than typical month-to-month changes in electricity rates.
Aggregation is publicized in advance of the referendum, and each household receives a
13

An additional concern is that the implementation of aggregation could influence the supply price paid
by remaining ComEd customers through a reverse causality channel: if communities with favorable load
profiles implemented aggregation, then the remaining ComEd communities would be more costly to serve,
causing ComEd to increase its price. However, ComEd still supplied a large pool of customers throughout
our sample period, and the fact that aggregation prices converged to the ComEd price in 2015–2016 suggests
that selection based on the load profile is not a significant concern in our setting.

11

mailer informing them of the new aggregation price. Likewise, the drop in ComEd prices
received statewide attention in the press.14 Though we cannot say whether other potential
energy policies (e.g., a carbon tax) that affect electricity prices will be more or less salient,
they are also likely to be anticipated and publicized. Aggregation therefore provides a good
setting for assessing the residential usage response to energy policies.
Finally, because ComEd’s supply price does not vary geographically, we can use our
raw data to calculate the savings aggregation communities obtained from switching suppliers. Specifically, we multiply aggregation communities’ observed electricity usage by the
price difference each month and aggregate over our sample period. We estimate that the
residential aggregation consumers in our sample saved $566 million through June 2014.

III

Empirical Strategy
A

Overview

Measuring price differences brought about by aggregation is straightforward. Each aggregation community has a constant marginal electricity supply rate that is set within a
few months of passing a referendum. The counterfactual supply price for each aggregation community is the ComEd price, as non-aggregation supply prices do not vary within
ComEd’s service area. Similarly, there is no meaningful geographic variation in the other
components of marginal price. Thus, the primary challenge is estimating counterfactual
electricity usage for aggregation communities.
We estimate the community-level usage response to changes in the electricity price by
matching communities that implemented aggregation (the “treated” group) to communities that did not (the “control” group) based on their pre-aggregation electricity usage. We
exploit the fact that the implementation of aggregation depended on a referendum, which
was plausibly exogenous with respect to expected changes in electricity usage. (We provide some empirical evidence for this identifying assumption in subsequent sections.) Our
setting is an ideal application for a matching estimator. The large, diverse set of control
communities makes it likely that a nearest-neighbor matching approach will successfully
find a suitable comparison group. Additionally, we have enough pre-aggregation usage
data for an internal validation of our approach.

“What’s happening to your electric bill June 1?” Citizens Utility Board, May 30, 2013.

12

We then estimate elasticities by regressing usage changes, as calculated by our matching estimator, on corresponding aggregation-driven price shocks. We measure how the
response of usage to contemporaneous electricity prices evolves following a successful aggregation referendum. The elasticities estimated by this model are accurate to the extent
that the post-period price changes in our sample can be reasonably approximated as a onetime, permanent change in price. We account for the empirical variation in prices over
time in Section V, where we estimate a more flexible model that disentangles the short-run
response to price changes from the longer-run response.
B

Difference-in-Differences Matching Estimator

To estimate changes in electricity usage brought about by aggregation, we apply a differencein-differences adjustment to the bias-corrected matching estimator developed by Abadie
and Imbens (2006, 2011). For each of the 289 treated communities, we use 2008–2009
electricity usage data to identify the five nearest neighbors from the 479 control communities available in our sample. We average annual log usage and monthly log deviations
from annual usage across 2008 and 2009 to construct 13 match variables. We standardize
the variables and use an equal-weight least squares metric to calculate distances between
communities. That distance is then used to select the five nearest neighbors for each treated
community.15 We allow non-aggregation communities to be selected as neighbors for multiple aggregation communities; i.e., each aggregation community draws from an identical
set of potential controls. We use these nearest neighbors to construct counterfactual usage
and employ standard difference-in-differences techniques to adjust for pre-period differences. The identifying assumption is that, conditional on 2008–2009 usage, the passage of
aggregation and subsequent price changes are unrelated to anticipated electricity use. We
provide evidence that this assumption is reasonable by showing that trends in usage for the
control and treated groups remain parallel after the matching period but before the passage
of aggregation.
Let Yit denote log usage for community i in period t, where t = 0 corresponds to the
referendum date for each treated community. For control communities, t = 0 corresponds
to the referendum date of the treated community to which they have been matched. Let
the indicator variable Di be equal to 1 if a community ever implements aggregation and 0
otherwise. The outcome Yit is a function of Di , so that, for aggregation communities, Yit (1)

Table A.1 in the Appendix shows that the results are very similar if we instead select the single nearest
neighbor or the ten nearest neighbors.

13

indicates usage when treated and Ybit (0) indicates estimated counterfactual usage when not
treated. Given Yit (1) and Ybit (0), we can obtain a community-specific estimate of the effect
d it :
of aggregation on usage, ∆Y
d it = Yit (1) − Ybit (0).
∆Y

(1)

We observe the outcome Yit (1) for the treated communities in our data. The counterfactual outcome, Ybit (0), is unobserved and is calculated as follows. For each treated community i, we select M = 5 nearest neighbors using the procedure previously discussed.
Let JM (i) denote the set of control communities for community i. The counterfactual
outcome, Ybit (0), is then equal to

community’s nearest neighbors plus the difference in usage between that community and
its neighbors averaged across the 2008–2009 calendar months corresponding to t.
Finally, we obtain a community-specific “difference-in-differences” estimate of the impact on usage by netting out the average change in usage in the year prior to treatment. This
estimate is defined as

where Ns indicates the number of periods in the year prior to the policy change.16 The ∆Y
terms on the right-hand side of equation (2) are defined in equation (1). Our difference-indifferences estimate τbit thus reflects the difference in usage between a treated community
and its matched control communities in period t, relative to the average difference in the
year leading up to the policy change. To quantify the average impact of the policy on usage,
we take the mean of the community-specific treatment effects:
N1
1 X
b
τt =

N1 i=1

(3)

where N1 denotes the number of treated communities in our sample. Because the policy
change occurs at the community level, and we only include communities that implement
aggregation, we interpret this estimate as the effect of the treatment on the treated.17
In our setting, the aggregation electricity price is announced months before the actual
price change takes place. Thus, consumers may respond to future price changes by, for
example, placing less weight on energy efficiency when replacing old appliances, changing
their thermostat program, or changing energy use habits. Failing to account for anticipation effects in a difference-in-differences framework can lead to biased treatment effect
estimates when consumers are forward-looking (Malani and Reif, 2015). Ample evidence
from the energy literature suggests that anticipation effects can be important determinants
of consumer behavior. For example, Myers (2016) finds that expected future heating costs
appear to be capitalized fully into housing values. While Allcott and Wozny (2014) reject full capitalization of gasoline prices into used vehicle prices, they nonetheless find
that vehicle prices are significantly affected by future expected fuel costs. Because we
do not observe exactly when the price change is announced, our main specification estimates effects that are relative to the referendum date, rather than when aggregation was
implemented. Section 4 of the Appendix presents evidence of anticipatory behavior by estimating changes in electricity use after the referendum is passed but before a community
switches to a new supplier.18
We estimate price changes the same way we estimate usage changes: by comparing
prices in the treated community to its matched controls. Because electricity rates do not
16

For monthly estimates, Ns = 12. For biannual estimates, Ns = 2.
Because a small proportion of households opted out of aggregation, at the household level our estimate
reflects an intent-to-treat effect (conditional on implementing aggregation).
18
It is also possible for consumers to make changes even prior to the passage of the referendum, in anticipation that it will pass and that electricity prices will fall. We find no evidence of such behavior.

vary in the cross-section for non-aggregation communities, the price difference is exactly
zero prior to a community’s implementation of aggregation. Therefore, the differencein-differences estimate of log price changes is simply the observed difference between the
community’s aggregation rate and the ComEd rate, ∆ ln pit . The mean effect of aggregation
on prices is the average of these differences:

Estimating Elasticities

To obtain elasticities, we regress community-specific estimates of the change in usage on
community-specific price changes. We estimate separate elasticities over time in order to
show how the elasticity changes dynamically. For a set of post-referendum periods, g, the
corresponding elasticity, βg , is obtained via the regression
τbit = βg · ∆ ln pit + ηit

∀t ∈ g.

(5)

We estimate two versions of this specification. First, we estimate equation (5) separately
for each month post-referendum (i.e., {g} = {t}). Second, to increase the precision of our
estimates, we group the data into six-month intervals and estimate equation (5) for each of
these groups. In this second specification, βg is the average elasticity for each six-month
period. We also report estimates of the mean change in log price and in log usage in each

Inference

Because matching estimators do not meet the regularity conditions required for bootstrapping (Abadie and Imbens, 2008), we employ a subsampling procedure to construct confidence intervals for our matching estimates.19 Subsampling, like bootstrapping, obtains a
distribution of parameter estimates by sampling from the observed data.

Abadie and Imbens (2006, 2011) provide a formula for the standard errors of bias-corrected matching
estimators of average treatment effects. Our panel data structure and the use of match-specific indexing for
the control communities relative to the treated communities preclude a simple implementation of this formula.
Further, our main estimates are not simple average treatment effects.

where R is a tuning parameter (Politis and Romano, 1994) and N0 is the number of control
communities. As before, N1 is the number of treated (aggregation) communities. For each

The lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals can then be estimated as Fb−1 (0.025)
and Fb−1 (0.975).
Subsampling requires a large number of effective observations (i.e., treated units) in
each subsample, but it also requires that this number be small relative to the total number
of effective observations in the full sample. We employ R = 3 (B1 = 51) for the confidence intervals and standard errors reported in the paper, which prioritizes the large-sample
properties within each subsample. Table A.2 in the Appendix compares standard errors for
different values of the tuning parameter R and shows they are robust.
E

Advantages of Matching Estimators with Electricity Data

A key advantage of the nearest-neighbor approach is that it eliminates control communities
that are not observationally similar to treated communities and whose inclusion would thus
add noise (and possibly bias) to the estimation. Electricity usage is highly seasonal, with
peaks in winter and summer and troughs in spring and fall (see Figure A.6 in the Appendix),
and the degree of seasonality varies widely across the different communities in our sample.
Identifying control communities with usage profiles similar to aggregation communities
can therefore greatly increase precision.
Figure 3 provides a demonstration of this benefit. Panel (a) displays electricity usm(t)
age adjusted for community-level monthly seasonal patterns (Yit − µ
bi ) for aggregation
(treated) and non-aggregation (control) communities. Even after accounting for communityspecific seasonality using monthly data from 2008 and 2009, usage varies greatly within
and across years: the largest peak occurs in July 2012, which corresponds to a record heat
wave. By contrast, summer peaks are much less pronounced in 2009 and 2013, when the
summers were mild. The difference between these two time series, which corresponds to an
event study regression with community-specific month-of-year fixed effects, is displayed
in panel (c). The increase in the difference is visible beginning in late-2011, which can be

attributed to the implementation of aggregation, but this difference is quite noisy. The heterogeneity in seasonal patterns poses a challenge for a standard regression that compares
treated communities to all control communities in the sample: it is difficult to estimate
an effect when the baseline month-to-month divergence in usage is of the same order of
magnitude as the effect.
Panels (b) and (d) of Figure 3 show analogous plots for the nearest-neighbor matching
approach discussed above. Vertical dotted lines indicate the matching window of 2008
18

through 2009. Panel (d) shows again that the difference in log usage between treatment and
(matched) control communities increases beginning in late-2011. The difference in panel
(d) exhibits far less noise than the difference displayed in panel (c), however, because
the matching estimator selects only those control communities that are similar to treated
communities. This method of selection allows the matching estimator to generate more
precise estimates than the standard difference-in-differences estimator.
To see whether matching also helps improve the similarity between treated and control communities on other dimensions, we matched the names of the communities in our
ComEd sample to data obtained from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS)
Summary File. We obtained ACS matches for 286 out of 289 aggregation communities,
and 385 out of 479 non-aggregation communities.20 Compared to all non-aggregation communities, communities that implemented aggregation are significantly larger, younger, and
more educated (see Table A.3 in the Appendix for more details). They are also less white,
and have more expensive and slightly newer housing. However, the 2010 electricity usage per capita is very similar for aggregation and non-aggregation communities. After
matching on monthly and annual electricity usage, the weighted pool of matched controls
is more similar to the aggregation communities. With two exceptions (percent black and
longitude), the differences between non-aggregation and aggregation communities are less
likely to be statistically significant, which indicates that matching on usage also selects
control communities with more similar socioeconomic characteristics.

Main Results

We first show that electricity prices fell substantially and persistently following the passage of aggregation referenda. Panel (a) in Figure 4 displays the average change in log
prices for aggregation communities, relative to their matched controls (∆ ln pt ). The price
change is exactly equal to zero in the pre-period because the treated communities face the
same ComEd supply prices as their matched control communities during that time period.
Within 12 months of passing the referendum, prices in aggregation communities decrease
by 0.27 log points (about 24 percent) relative to control communities, although they re20

Aggregation is generally implemented at the township, village, or city level. These different levels of
municipal governments frequently overlap and have similar names. In order to minimize incorrect matches,
we avoided ambiguous matches.

Notes: Panel (a) shows the effect of aggregation on the log of the electricity price, as calculated by equation
(4). Because treatment and control communities faced the same price prior to aggregation, the pre-period
difference is exactly zero. Panel (b) shows the effect of aggregation on average log electricity usage, as calculated by equation (3). These estimates are normalized so that the average usage difference in the year prior
to the referendum is zero. The short dashed line displayed in both panels indicates the median implementation date relative to when the referendum was passed (4 months). Confidence intervals are constructed via

Panel (b) in Figure 4 displays the corresponding estimates for electricity usage (b
Prior to the referendum, the difference in usage between aggregation and control communities is nearly constant and never significantly different from zero. We emphasize that
this result is not mechanical, as our 2008–2009 matching period predates the vast majority
of successful aggregation referenda by at least two years (see Table 1).21 Following the
referendum, relative usage in aggregation communities increases by about 0.06 log points
(6.1 percent) by the end of first year after the referendum. This difference shrinks to about
0.04 log points (4.1 percent) at month 15 because of the ComEd price decrease; it then
stabilizes. Because the aggregation prices are stable around the date of the ComEd price
drop (see Figure 2), this pattern provides persuasive evidence that both aggregation and
non-aggregation communities are responding to their respective price changes. Thus, our

Specifically, 270 of the 289 aggregation communities have virtually no overlap between the matching
period and the pre-period estimates in Figure 4.

Notes: This figure plots estimates of β̂g from equation (5). Each point estimate comes from a separate regression of estimated community-specific changes in usage on the corresponding price changes for a particular
post-referendum time period g. Panel (a) reports estimates from a series of monthly regressions. Panel (b)
reports estimates from an analogous specification that groups the data into six-month intervals. The estimates

results are not driven merely by the salience of the price change brought about by aggregation.
Figure 5 displays reduced-form estimates of the price elasticity of demand (equation
(5)). We present both monthly and biannual elasticities. Due to their greater precision, we
consider the biannual estimates our primary specification, and we summarize them in Table
2.22 The elasticity estimates increase in magnitude from about −0.09 in the first 6 months
following the referendum up to −0.27 two years later, indicating that consumers are much
more elastic in the long run than the short run and ruling out a constant price elasticity. In
other words, usage does not respond fully to price changes in the near term.
The time-varying elasticity shown in Figure 5 is not due to the delay between the dates
of the referenda and the dates of the actual price changes. While it is true that usage
patterns in Figure 4 reflect the lag between referenda and implementation, so do the price
patterns. As the usage changes are scaled by the price changes, the implementation lag does
not matter when calculating elasticities. For example, if the price elasticity were in fact
constant over time, we would estimate it as such, even in the presence of implementation
22
Point estimates for monthly elasticity estimates can be found in Table A.4 in the Appendix. Table A.5
reports the corresponding yearly estimates. We have also estimated a specification that models the price
elasticity as a quadratic function of the number of months since the referendum. The results, displayed in
Figure A.7, are very similar.

observations corresponds to the number of observations used for each elasticity estimate. Standard errors,

delays.
The sharp decrease in the estimated monthly elasticity at month 15 in Figure 5 corresponds to the large ComEd price decrease. Because the adjustment process is dynamic,
the usage difference does not shrink as quickly as the price difference, which causes the
estimated monthly price elasticity to increase in magnitude temporarily. This demonstrates
a challenge with interpreting the reduced-form price elasticity: our estimate captures a mix
of short-run and longer-run responses to (1) the price decrease due to aggregation; (2) the
drop in ComEd prices in June 2013; and (3) the monthly variation in the ComEd rate. In
addition, consumers may respond to anticipated price changes. These caveats aside, the
growth over time in the magnitude of the estimated elasticity suggests that the long-run
effects of aggregation dominate the shorter-run responses to other price changes.
The finding that consumers are more elastic in the long run than in the short run is
consistent with several mechanisms, including habit formation, inattention, learning, and
slow-moving investments in appliances and home insulation. For example, Brandon et al.
(2017) find that 35–55 percent of the energy reductions due to a non-price intervention (a

22

home energy report) persist even after the treated household moves out of the dwelling,
suggesting that investments in physical capital matter for energy consumption changes in
their setting. In order to gauge the potential role of appliance replacement in our setting, we
perform a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation. Suppose that new appliances bought in
non-aggregation communities used 10–20 percent less energy than new appliances bought
in aggregation communities.23 To account for the estimated 4 percent energy use difference two years after aggregation, 20–40 percent of appliances would need to be replaced
within this time period. This value is higher than the typical two-year replacement rate
for major household appliances, which ranges from 5–20 percent.24 Thus, while appliance
replacement behavior can explain some of our findings, other mechanisms—such as those
mentioned above—likely play a role. Because we do not have data on consumer behavior beyond electricity consumption, we do not attempt to further distinguish among these
different adjustment channels.

Robustness Checks and Extensions

Our main identifying assumption is that the price changes caused by aggregation were uncorrelated with expected future changes in usage, conditional on our control communities.
If suppliers offered different prices based on predicted future usage, this price targeting
might generate bias in our estimates. Our nearest-neighbor controls are selected based on a
community’s historical usage data, which are the same data used by suppliers to determine
prices. Therefore, we think that systematic correlation between price and unobservable factors that affect post-referendum usage is unlikely. We also perform a simple empirical test
for price targeting by suppliers. We split the treated communities into seven equal groups
based on the price change they experienced in the first two years following their referenda.
We then calculate the average elasticity separately for each group by pooling observations
in this two-year period and estimating equation (5). If suppliers were offering prices to
communities based on expected changes in demand, then we might find a systematic rela23

This difference reflects the gap between ENERGY STAR efficiency and the minimum required efficiency.
Houde (2018) shows that appliance manufacturers tend to bunch their product offerings at these two levels.
24
Clothes washers, clothes dryers, and water heaters have a lifespan of about 10 years, refrigerators have
a lifespan of about 15 years, and air conditioners have a lifespan of 15–20 years. Moreover, some aggregation households are likely to continue purchasing ENERGY STAR appliances, while some non-aggregation
households purchase non-ENERGY STAR appliances, implying that an even larger replacement rate would
be necessary to generate the effects we observe. For reference, in 2009, 54 percent of clothes washers, 4 percent of water heaters, 40 percent of refrigerators, 34 percent of air conditioners, and 76 percent of dishwashers
sold in Illinois were ENERGY STAR certified (Environmental Protection Agency, 2018).

tionship between estimated elasticities and prices. However, we find no clear relationship
between the two. Figure A.8 in the Appendix plots these estimates.
We chose January 2008 through December 2009 as our matching period because it
allowed us to closely match controls to treated communities while also providing a fairly
long post-matching period to test for pre-trends. We have also estimated our model using
an alternative matching period of February 2007 through January 2009.25 These results are
very similar to those in the paper and are available upon request. Additionally, we show in
Table A.1 of the Appendix that we obtain similar results if we match to the single nearest
neighbor or the ten nearest neighbors, instead of the five we use as our baseline.
As a placebo test, we estimate how usage evolves for communities that passed a referendum but never implemented aggregation (see Figure A.9 in the Appendix). Although the
estimates are noisy, they suggest that there was no increase in usage due to the referendum
itself in those communities.
We have also estimated the effect of aggregation on electricity usage using a differencein-differences reduced-form approach without matching. In this analysis, which we discuss
in detail in Section 3 of the Appendix, we exploit the variation of the timing of implementation among aggregation communities. The results are qualitatively similar to the
results presented in the main text. In particular, we again find a price elasticity that grows
post-referendum but no evidence of pre-trends, supporting the identifying assumption that
passage of aggregation was not prompted by expected growth in electricity usage.
Our setting also allows us to test for pre-period changes in behavior. Following the
passage of the aggregation referendum and choice of a new supplier, all residents were
notified by mail of the new price and the exact month it took effect. In results shown and
discussed in Section 4 of the Appendix, we find that consumers responded prior to the price
change: usage increased shortly after passage of the referendum, but before the actual price
decrease several months later. Unfortunately, we lack data to identify the primary mechanism driving this behavior, which could be rational anticipation or confusion. Regardless of
the mechanism, this result provides evidence that consumers begin adjusting their electricity usage prior to realized price changes, suggesting that the myopic “partial adjustment”
model typically estimated in the energy literature (Hughes et al., 2008; Alberini and Filippini, 2011; Blázquez et al., 2013) could be systematically biased.
25

We do not include January 2007 in the alternative matching period because reported usage in this month
is inexplicably low for many communities. This shortfall suggests that the usage data in the first month of the
sample are incomplete.

24

Finally, it is worth noting that Illinois is similar to the U.S. as a whole along several
dimensions related to electricity consumption. We describe the relationship between key
U.S. and Illinois demographics in Section 5 in the Appendix. To understand how our results
generalize to geographies with different demographics, that section also explores how our
elasticity estimates vary by communities’ socioeconomic characteristics.

V

Accounting for Dynamics
A

Framework

The presence of dynamics poses a challenge to interpreting the results in the previous section: because relative prices are changing over time (see Figure 4), contemporaneous usage
reflects both a short-run response to recent price changes and a longer-run response to
earlier price changes. In general, dynamics in consumer behavior imply that usage is a
function of past and (potentially) future prices.26 In this section, we explicitly account
for these dynamics by regressing our community-specific matching estimates of log usage
changes, τbit , on lags and leads of log price changes:
τbit =

L2
X

δr · ∆ ln pi(t−r) + ηit .

(6)

r=−L1

The number of leads in the regression is equal to L1 , and the number of lags is L2 . We consider four specifications, constructed such that each has a different set of 31 coefficients:
(L1 , L2 ) ∈ {(18, 12), (12, 18), (6, 24), (0, 30)}. To convert these estimates to a price elasticity s months after a price change, we construct the dynamic elasticity parameter
βs :=

s
X

δr .

(7)

r=−L1

Although our usage data end in June 2014, we observe prices through 2016, allowing us
to estimate equation (6) without losing observations. To reduce sensitivity to outliers, we
estimate this model using median (minimum absolute deviation) regressions instead of least
squares.27
26

See the conceptual framework presented in Section 6 of the Appendix for a simple demonstration.
Point estimates from least squares regressions are similar, but the subsampling routine described in Section III does not converge for some subsamples in the least squares specification. This reflects the sensitivity
of least squares to outliers and the relatively small size of each subsample.
27

25

To reduce noise in the estimates, we also estimate a parametric specification of equation
(6). This specification still relies on our quasi-experimental variation, but it restricts the
relationships among the set {δr } in equation (6). Specifically, we assume the cumulative
elasticity can be modeled as an exponential function of lags and a linear function of leads:
βs :=

s
X
r=−∞

δr = (γ1 −

γ1
s · 1[s ≤ 0]) · 1[s ≥ γ2 ] + γ3 (1 − exp(γ4 s)) · 1[s >= 0], (8)
γ2

where s is again the number of months since a price change. Thus, negative numbers
indicate the price change has not happened yet. According to equation (8), the elasticity
corresponding to an anticipated, contemporaneous price shock is equal to γ1 , and the longrun elasticity is equal to γ1 + γ3 . The parameters γ2 and γ4 govern the speed of adjustment.
In addition to delivering more precise estimates, the parametric specification also allows us
to calculate elasticities outside our data window. We estimate equation (8) by selecting the
parameters that minimize the mean absolute deviation between the observed usage response
and the response predicted by the model.
Equations (6) and (8) implicitly assume that consumers have perfect foresight. Following Anderson et al. (2013), we have also estimated the model using status quo (“no
change”) expectations. The results are similar to the ones we present below.
B

Results

The results from the dynamic model are presented in Figure 6. The markers report dynamic
elasticities, as estimated by equations (6) and (7), for the four specifications described
earlier. Each marker represents the cumulative electricity usage change (in percent) in
response to an anticipated one-percent price change that begins in month 0 and persists.
The solid line corresponds to the parametric model specified by equation (8) and lines up
closely with the unrestricted estimates.28 Note that the period t = 0 in Figure 6 corresponds
to the date of the price change, but in Figures 4 and 5, period t = 0 corresponds to the date
of the referendum, which occurs four months earlier for the median community.
Overall, the estimates follow a similar pattern to the reduced-form results presented
in Section IV. Following the price change, the usage response grows over time, with an
implied elasticity of about −0.1 six months post-implementation and an elasticity of about
−0.2 eighteen months post-implementation. Thus, consumer dynamics play an important

includes 12 leads and 18 lags. Each point displays the estimated elasticity as a function of the number of

role in the first two years after a price change. The dynamic model also estimates that
consumers begin to respond in advance of a price change, though the pre-price-change
elasticities are small, averaging −0.02 in the six months prior to a price change.
The first two columns of Table 3 summarize the non-parametric and parametric estimates of the dynamic elasticity curve, respectively. The reported coefficients are the mean
of the point estimates in Figure 6 within each interval indicated by each row. Again, these
estimates correspond to the effect of a permanent, anticipated increase in price beginning at
time t = 0 on usage s months after. These estimates indicate an elasticity of approximately
−0.085 in months 1–6 and an elasticity of −0.21 in months 19–24.29
For comparison, we also provide analogous reduced-form estimates in column (3) of

Section IV, but re-index the estimates to the date of the price change, rather than the date

plementation causes the reduced-form estimates to overstate the elasticity after this point,
as contemporaneous usage still partially reflects the earlier (larger) price difference. Nevertheless, the estimates are quite similar overall, which suggests that modeling municipal
aggregation as a permanent price shock is reasonable in our setting.
Although the primary benefit of the dynamic model is that it disentangles the effects of
contemporaneous versus lagged price changes on current usage, the estimated parameters
can also be used to project the usage response beyond the two-and-a-half-year post period
in our data. As a calibration exercise, we report the long-run projections arising from our
parametric model in Table 4. We estimate a three-year elasticity of −0.27 and a five-year
elasticity of −0.32. Both the ten-year and the long-run elasticity are close to −0.35. Thus,
over 90 percent of the long-run consumer response occurs within five years of the price
change, and nearly 100 percent occurs within ten years. These estimates imply that prices
from more than ten years ago have little (direct) impact on residential electricity consumption today. These dynamics are similar to those found in Allcott and Rogers (2014), who
find that the consumption effects of a home energy report decay by 10–20 percent per year
after it is discontinued, implying that consumers fully adjust after 5–10 years.

Discussion

The fact that the price elasticity of residential electricity demand grows significantly over
time has two important implications. First, regulations that increase the price of electricity
will have much larger effects on consumption in the long run than in the short run, and
policymakers who do not anticipate this will therefore underestimate the long-run effects of
such regulations. Second, the long-run share of the regulatory burden borne by consumers
will be smaller than the short-run share, at least in partial equilibrium.
We demonstrate the quantitative magnitudes of these implications with a few simple
calculations. Because our model was estimated using Illinois data, our exercises employ
Illinois data on electricity consumption, prices, and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions. The
exact data we use do not affect the primary implications of our analysis, however, as we
focus on relative comparisons (ratios) between the short- and longer-run elasticities.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2018), in 2016 Illinois generated 187,441,635 MWh of electricity at an average retail price of $93.8 per MWh. This
in turn produced 72,226 thousand metric tons of CO2 . For simplicity, we assume that the
residential electricity market is perfectly competitive and that all generated electricity is
sold at the average retail price. Because our goal is to highlight the role of the demand
elasticity, we abstract away from supply-side issues such as changes in the composition
of generation. Finally, because there is little consensus on the magnitude of the supply
elasticity, s , we perform all calculations under two different assumptions: s = 0.5 (low
elasticity of supply) and s = 5 (high elasticity of supply).
Our first exercise considers the implementation of a tax intended to reduce emissions.
Policymakers who wish to target a specific level of emissions must first predict how equilibrium electricity consumption responds to changes in taxes. In perfectly competitive
markets, the fall in equilibrium quantity following a small tax increase depends on both the
demand and supply elasticities (Salanie, 2011):

where Q is quantity, t is a per-unit tax, P is price, and s and d are the absolute values
of supply and demand elasticities, respectively. It is clear from this expression that underestimating the demand elasticity will underestimate the demand response following a
price change. We demonstrate the significance of this point in Table 5. Employing our sixmonth estimated elasticity and assuming a supply elasticity of s = 0.5, we calculate that

This table presents calculations of the effects of an electricity tax on electricity output; the size of a carbon
dioxide (CO2 ) tax required to reduce electricity-related emissions by 1%; and the incidence of these policies.
Column (1) presents results employing the estimated short-run (6-month) elasticity from Table 2 (−0.09).
Column (2) presents results using the corresponding two-year elasticity (−0.27). Calculations are based on
2016 Illinois statistics obtained from U.S. Energy Information Administration (2018): 187,441,635 MWh of
electricity generated; 72,226 thousand metric tons of CO2 emitted; average retail price of $93.8 per MWh.
All calculations assume perfectly competitive markets.

electricity output falls by 152,000 MWh per dollar increase in tax. By contrast, employing
our two-year estimate results in an estimate that is over twice as large, −350,000 MWh
per dollar. Panel (b) shows that this difference becomes even larger if we instead assume a
supply elasticity of s = 5.
Similarly, our second exercise shows that employing smaller demand elasticity estimates will reduce the predicted effectiveness of a carbon tax. Assuming that all emissions
reductions must come from reduced electricity generation, a demand elasticity of −0.09
implies that a 1 percent reduction in emissions would require a tax of $27.5–$31.9 per ton
of CO2 , while a demand elasticity of −0.27 implies that a $9.5–$13.9 tax would be sufficient.31 In other words, the two-year elasticity we estimate yields tax rates that are 56–65
percent smaller than our six-month elasticity would imply. It is worth noting that, because
both the six-month and two-year estimated elasticities are quite inelastic, the taxes required

then we estimate that consumers would bear 85 percent of the burden when the demand

When supply is elastic (s = 5), however, the consumer share of the tax burden is not
sensitive to our range of demand elasticity estimates.33

VII

Conclusion

Electricity suppliers, market regulators, and policymakers all need to understand how electricity consumption responds to changes in price. For example, accurately predicting the
long-run effect of a carbon tax on electricity consumption (and its accompanying emissions) requires a good estimate of the long-run price elasticity of demand. However, few
reliable estimates of this important parameter exist, because price changes in this market
are often endogenous, short-lived, small, or unnoticed. Our study provides the first quasiexperimental estimate of the two-year price elasticity of residential electricity demand, and
we find that it is more than double the short-run (six-month) elasticity, although it is still
inelastic. In addition, our long-run projections suggest that it takes ten years for consumers
to fully respond, which implies that consumer behavior may depend upon price changes
that occurred up to ten years ago.
There are several possible reasons why our estimated elasticity grows over time. It
takes time to change habits, such as turning off the lights or turning down the air conditioning when away from home. Usage also depends on the energy efficiency of durables
such as dishwashers, dryers, and air conditioners, which are purchased infrequently and are
continuously replaced within a population. Some consumers may need time to learn that
32

Weyl and Fabinger (2013) extend the analysis of incidence to imperfectly competitive markets and show
that, while the incidence formula becomes more complicated, it is still a function of the demand elasticity.
33
One concern that arises when discussing incidence in the electricity sector is that residential electricity
rates are often controlled by utility regulators. As of 2016, however, fifteen states had retail choice for
electricity supply (Morey and Kirsch, 2016). Some of these states, as well as others that do not allow retail
choice, impose profit constraints on incumbent suppliers (e.g., the zero-profit condition in Illinois). Thus, the
supply component of price is tightly linked to changes in the costs of electricity generation. In such cases,
the standard incidence framework remains relevant.

32

the electricity price has changed, especially if the benefit of tracking price changes is small
relative to the cost of paying attention. Whatever the underlying mechanism, our results underscore the importance of identifying settings that accurately capture longer-run responses
to price changes, as short-run data may cause the researcher to significantly underestimate
the long-run response.
Our results also matter for the organization of electricity markets. For example, there is
some debate as to whether to use a downward-sloping or vertical demand curve in forward
capacity auctions for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) electricity
area (Cook, 2016a,b). As the relevant time period for these auctions spans multiple years,
our findings suggest that using a downward-sloping demand curve in this setting is appropriate.
Finally, we note that the natural experiment created by municipal aggregation decreased
electricity prices, whereas price-based climate policies would increase prices to reduce total
carbon emissions. It is therefore important to know whether price increases and decreases
have symmetric effects on demand. In addition, other energy policies such as a carbon tax
may be less salient or more salient to consumers than aggregation, which in turn may affect
the speed and magnitude of the consumer response. Future research along these dimensions
would be valuable.

Municipal Aggregation Materials

After the proposed aggregation program has been registered with the state, the municipality must
hold a referendum. The wording of the referendum question is specified in the Illinois Power
Agency Act:1
The election authority must submit the question in substantially the following form:
Shall the (municipality, township, or county in which the question is being voted upon)
have the authority to arrange for the supply of electricity for its residential and small
commercial retail customers who have not opted out of such program?
The election authority must record the votes as “Yes” or “No”.
Figure A.1 displays an example of a letter sent to residents of a community following the
passage of an aggregation referendum and selection of a new aggregation supplier. The letter
informs residents about their new supply price for electricity, and lets them know that they will
have an opportunity to opt out of aggregation. Figure A.2 displays an example of the opt-out card
that a customer must fill out and mail if they wish to retain their current electricity supplier.
Figures A.3 and A.4 display the front and back page of a typical electricity bill for a customer
residing in ComEd’s service territory. If a customer switches suppliers, e.g., her community adopts
aggregation and she does not opt out, then the Electricity Supply Charge rate (see Figure A.4) will
change. Otherwise her bill will remain the same.

Data Appendix

Consistent Usage Data
In the usage data provided by ComEd, several communities change definitions over time, moving
customers from one community to another or creating a new community. These changes appears
as large, discrete jumps in our community-level aggregate usage data. To eliminate this noise, we
apply two filters to search for large structural breaks. For each community, we run 89 separate
regressions of log usage on month-of-year indicators and a structural break indicator, where we
start the structural break indicator at each month in the sample. We then compare the maximum
R-squared to the minimum R-squared among a community’s set of regressions. If this difference
exceeds 0.5, then the community is dropped from the sample.

For the second filter, we run a series of similar regressions with the addition of a linear time
trend. For this filter, we drop any communities for which the explanatory power of the break
increases the R-squared by more than 0.2.
Together, these two filters remove 79 communities from our initial sample of 887 service territories. We remove an additional 29 communities from our sample because they were missing data
and/or we could not confidently assign them to our treatment or control groups. Finally, we also
drop 11 communities that passed a referendum approving aggregation but never implemented the
program, leaving us with 768 (= 887 - 79 - 29 - 11) communities in our final sample.
One concern with the two filters that we applied is that we may eliminate actual structural
breaks arising from municipal aggregation. However, the communities that were removed in this
fashion were primarily small communities that did not implement aggregation.
Other Components of the Electricity Bill
All fixed fees and remaining usage rates are nearly identical across the aggregation and nonaggregation communities in our sample. The average fixed fee for customers residing in ComEd
service territories during our sample period is $12.52 per month. We ignore the fixed fees in our
analysis, because they do not vary across communities and because our independent variable is the
difference in the (log) marginal price between aggregation and non-aggregation communities. In
rare instances the aggregation supplier charged an additional fixed fee, but these scenarios were
short-lived. Municipal tax rates do vary across communities, but the variation is small and they
rarely change over time. For our analysis, we use the median tax rate across ComEd communities
(0.557 cents/kWh). The price variable in our estimating equations is equal to the aggregation supply rate plus all other usage rates if the community has implemented aggregation; otherwise, it is
equal to the ComEd supply rate plus all other usage rates.
Sources for Aggregation Rates
This section summarizes the data sources used to verify the rates obtained by aggregation communities. The primary data source is Plug In Illinois. If information was unavailable from Plug
In Illinois, we tried to retrieve it from websites of the participating communities or from FOIA
requests made to the local governments.
Plug In Illinois The website https://pluginillinois.org/MunicipalAggregationList.aspx lists the
current state of aggregation programs in Illinois. If a community is currently on an aggregation
plan, the rate and the end of the contract are listed. Repeated snapshots of the website were used

2

to track the rates over time. For many of the communities, Plug In Illinois provides a link to access
the opt-out letter and a link to the terms and conditions of service.
Opt-Out Letter The opt-out letter is sent to all households following passage of the referendum.
The letter confirms the aggregation program and provides them with an opportunity to opt out and
remain with ComEd. The letter also includes the aggregation rate and the relevant time period.
Terms and Conditions of Service The terms and conditions are sent to households that do not
opt out of the aggregation program. The terms and conditions are an agreement between a household and the alternative retail electric supplier, and they indicate the aggregation rate and the relevant time period.
Master Agreement The master agreement is the contract between the alternative retail electric
supplier and the local government. The agreement indicates the term of the agreement and the
agreed-upon rate. We obtained these through FOIA requests.

Difference-in-Differences Estimates without Matching

In this section, we describe how we estimate the effect of implementing aggregation on electricity
prices and usage using a standard difference-in-differences model with no matching. Our estimating equation is given by
Ycmy =

24
X

βτ Acτ + β25 Ac,25 + β−25 Ac,−25 + αcm + αmy + εcmy ,

(A.1)

τ =−24,τ 6=−1

where Ycmy is either the natural logarithm of the monthly price or the natural logarithm of total
monthly electricity use in community c in calendar month m and year y. The variable Acτ is an
indicator equal to 1 if, as of month m and year y, community c passed an aggregation referendum
τ months ago. The month before the referendum (τ = −1) is the omitted category. The main
parameter of interest is βτ .
To ensure that βτ reflects changes relative to the omitted category, we include indicators for
aggregation having been passed 25 or more months ago (Ac,25 ) and for aggregation being passed
25 or more months in the future (Ac,−25 ). We also include month-by-year (αmy ) and communityby-month (αcm ) fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the community level. We discuss the
robustness of our estimates to different sets of fixed effects below.
We also estimate a second, more parametric specification that assesses the effect by six-month

3

periods and uses the entire two years prior to the referendum as the reference period:
Ycmy = γ1 Ac,0 to 6 + γ2 Ac,7 to 12 + γ3 Ac,13 to 18 + γ4 Ac,19 to 24
+β25 Ac,25 + β−25 Ac,−25 + αcm + αmy + εcmy .

(A.2)

In this specification, Ac,0 to 6 is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the community passed aggregation
in the past 6 months and 0 otherwise. Similarly, Ac,7 to 12 is an indicator equal to 1 if the community
passed aggregation between 7 and 12 months ago, and so on. The other variables are defined as in
equation (A.1).
One could estimate the effect of implementing aggregation by comparing communities that
implemented aggregation to those that did not implement aggregation. However, the latter may not
serve as an adequate counterfactual for the former without correcting for systematic differences
via matching, as we do in the main text. We therefore restrict our estimation sample here to
communities that implemented aggregation.2 Our main identifying assumption is that, conditional
on the included fixed effects, the timing of aggregation adoption is exogenous with respect to
electricity use.
Figure A.10 presents the change in electricity prices following aggregation, in logs, as estimated by equation (A.1). Similar to our matching results, prices do not drop immediately following the referendum because it takes time for communities to switch to a new supplier. Unlike the matching estimator, the pre-period price change is not exactly equal to zero in the eventstudy difference-in-difference. Although treatment and control communities face identical prices
in the pre-period in calendar time, they do not face identical prices in event-study time because
ComEd’s prices fluctuate month-to-month. This distinction does not matter for the matching estimator, which creates counterfactuals separately for each treated community. The second vertical
dashed line in Figure A.10 shows the point at which half of all communities have implemented aggregation (4 months after passing the referendum). Prices continue to drop as more communities
switch and then eventually stabilize. Within 8 months of passing the referendum, the average electricity price has decreased by more than 0.3 log points (26 percent) in aggregation communities
relative to the control group.
Figure A.11 shows the corresponding estimates for electricity usage. Prior the referendum,
the difference in usage between aggregation and the control communities is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Usage in aggregation communities then begins to increase following the
referendum. By the end of the first year, usage in aggregation communities is about 0.1 log points
(9.5 percent) higher relative to the counterfactual.
Table A.6 shows the estimated impact of aggregation on the log of the electricity price in

We also estimated a specification that uses all non-aggregation communities as controls. Those estimates are
similar to the ones we present here, although the coefficients are much less stable.

these communities 0–6, 7–12, 13–18, and 19–24 months after implementation, as estimated by
equation (A.2). The results consistently show large and significant price drops, and are robust to
including different fixed effects. Our preferred specification is presented in Column 4 and includes
community-by-month and month-by-year fixed effects. This specification estimates that electricity
prices fell by 0.1 log points in the first six months, and eventually stabilizes around 0.3 log points
by the end of the first year.
Table A.7 shows the estimated change in usage as estimated by equation (A.2) for the sample
of communities that implemented aggregation. Our preferred specification, presented in Column
4, estimates that electricity usage is 0.048 log points higher in the first 6 months following the
referendum, and this increases to 0.114 log points within one year.
Finally, Figure A.12 shows the elasticities implied by the usage and price results. Similar to
the main text, we regress the predicted aggregation-driven log change in a community’s electricity
usage on the change in log prices. To account for uncertainty in the price and usage estimates, we
cluster bootstrap the confidence intervals using 1000 draws. The implied elasticity ranges from
−0.33 7–12 months after passage of aggregation to −0.45 two and a half years after passage. The
differences in the magnitude between these and our matching estimates may be due to the fact that
they reflect a slightly different mix of communities and a different combination of short-run and
longer-run responses.

Anticipation Effects

Forward-looking individuals should respond to policies prior to their implementation if those policies can be anticipated and if there is a benefit of responding in advance. For example, prior
studies have documented that expectations of future policies and prices matter when purchasing
durables such as cars or houses or when making human capital investments (e.g., Poterba, 1984;
Ryoo and Rosen, 2004; Allcott and Wozny, 2014; Myers, 2016). The effect of aggregation on electricity usage is a good setting for detecting anticipation effects: the implementation of aggregation
was widely announced months ahead of time, and electricity usage depends on durable goods like
air conditioners, water heaters, and dishwashers, as well as on consumer habits and knowledge.
Though a price decrease is unlikely to cause an immediate spike in purchases of energy-inefficient
appliances, depreciated durable goods are continuously being replaced within a population, and
the efficiency of the replacement should depend, at the margin, on the price of electricity.
Both dynamic specifications reported in Table 3 find a small but significant anticipation response in the six months prior to a price change. To further validate this result, we re-estimate the
reduced-form specification given in equation (5), setting t = 0 to be the date that aggregation was
implemented (which corresponds to the date of the price change) rather than the date of the aggregation referendum. The results are shown in panel (a) of Figure 7. The price difference between

Notes: The figure displays estimates of the anticipation effects of implementing aggregation. In Panel (a), the vertical

corresponds to the month when aggregation was passed, and the short-dashed line indicates the median implementation
period. Confidence intervals are constructed via subsampling.

aggregation communities and their matched controls is zero prior to implementation. However,
usage begins increasing three months prior to the price change.
To explicitly isolate the anticipation effect, Panel (b) of Figure 7 displays estimates of changes
in electricity usage relative to the referendum date, using only pre-implementation data. Electricity usage increases steadily and significantly 3-5 months after the referendum despite the fact that
prices have not yet changed for the observations in this sample. Specifically, usage is 0.012 log
points higher 3 months after the referendum and 0.035 log points higher 5 months after the referendum, confirming the existence of non-trivial anticipation effects in our sample. We do not observe
any significant change in usage prior the referendum.
Together, these results suggest that the referendum and/or the subsequent price change announcement alerted consumers to the impending price decrease and caused them to increase their
usage, perhaps by placing less weight on energy efficiency when replacing old appliances or by
changing their electricity usage habits (relative to their control counterparts). Alternatively, it is
possible that customers were confused about the timing of the price change, although we note that
mailers were sent to all residents informing them of the exact month of the price change. More
generally, while our estimates are consistent with a standard forward-looking model of rational
consumers, they are also consistent with confusion and other behavioral mechanisms. Regardless
of the precise mechanism, to the extent that other policies are implemented in a similar manner,
they are likely to generate pre-implementation effects similar to those we find here.

Demographic Characteristics

Illinois versus the United States
Illinois is similar to the U.S. as a whole along several dimensions related to electricity consumption. Using daily station-level weather data from NOAA, we calculate that the average number of
population-weighted heating degree days between 1965–2010 in Illinois (U.S.) is 5,997 (5,115),
while the average number of population-weighted cooling degree days is 881 (1,086). Considering
that the state-level standard deviations for these two measures are approximately 2,100 and 746,
Illinois provides a close proxy for the average U.S. temperature patterns. Likewise, from 2000
to 2015, the difference between the average annual electricity price in Illinois and the U.S. as a
whole was −0.4 cents per kWh, which is only about four percent of the U.S. mean (U.S. Energy
Information Administration, 2017).
From 2011 to 2015, Illinois had an average per capita income of $30,494 (in 2015 dollars),
which is very close to the U.S. average of $28,930. Similarly, the Illinois employment rate was
65.6 percent, while the U.S. employment rate was 63.6 percent (United States Census Bureau,
2016). The 2010 demographic characteristics of Illinois are also comparable to the U.S. average:
14.5 percent of the Illinois population is black (versus 12.6 percent for the U.S.), 12.5 percent is
over the age of 65 (versus 13 percent for the U.S.), and 24.4 percent is under the age of 18 (versus
24 percent in the U.S.).
Elasticities by Demographic Characteristics
Next, we investigate how much variation in the reduced-form price elasticity can be explained
by demographic characteristics. Doing so helps us understand both the distributional effects of
policies that affect electricity prices and the generalizability of our results. For this exercise, we
regress the log net usage change at time t on the contemporaneous log price change and add
interactions between the log price change and indicator variables for whether or not a community
is in the top half of the distribution for xj , a characteristic of interest:
τbit = βg · ∆ ln pit +

J
X

(βj · ∆ ln pit · 1[xji > median(xj ))] + ηit .

j=1

The indicator 1[xji > median(xj )] is equal to 1 if the value of the (time-invariant) variable
xj for community i is above the median of the distribution and 0 otherwise. We estimate this
regression using J = 8 different characteristics obtained from the ACS, and report our results in
Figures A.13 and A.14. Because the estimation is done jointly, the displayed elasticities for any
given characteristic control for the other characteristics.

7

Figure A.13 reports heterogeneity results for variables related to the housing stock. Estimates
that are statistically different from each other (at the 10 percent level) are indicated with a marker.
Communities with newer homes (as measured by “year built”) have a more elastic demand response, conditional on the other characteristics. This difference could arise because newer homes
are more likely to have technology such as programmable thermostats, which make it easier for
consumers to control electricity consumption.
Figure A.14 reports heterogeneity results for socioeconomic characteristics. Surprisingly, age
and race appear to matter for the elasticity of demand more than economic variables such as income
and education. Younger communities have a more elastic response, as do communities with a
greater percentage of white people. By contrast, our elasticity estimates are relatively stable across
economic characteristics.

Framework for Consumption Dynamics
Summary

Residential electricity usage is unlikely to adjust immediately to price changes. It takes time to
change habits, such as turning off the lights or turning down the air conditioning when away from
home. Usage also depends on the energy efficiency of durables such as dishwashers, dryers, and air
conditioners, which are purchased infrequently and are continuously replaced within a population.
Finally, some consumers may need time to learn that the electricity price has changed, especially
if the benefit of tracking price changes is small relative to the cost of paying attention.
The presence of such adjustment costs suggests that the long-run response to a price change will
exceed the short-run response. Moreover, if consumers are forward-looking, they may respond in
anticipation of future price changes. Here, we present a simple framework demonstrating that our
empirical approach in Section V is consistent with a standard rational model of a forward-looking
consumer.
We employ the habit model of Becker et al. (1994), and provide a full derivation of these results
at the end of this appendix. Utility in each period depends on yt , the consumption of electricity in
that period, and on yt−1 , the consumption of electricity in the previous period.3 The consumer’s
∞
problem is:
X
max
Rt−1 U (yt , yt−1 , xt ) ,
yt ,xt

t=1

where y0 is given, R < 1 is the consumer’s discount factor, and xt represents consumption of a
composite good that is taken as numeraire. The consumer’s budget constraint is
3

Similarly, one could allow utility in each period to depend on a “stock” of appliances (Filippini et al., 2015). The
resulting model will exhibit dynamics similar to what we present here.

8

W0 =

∞
X

Rt−1 (xt + pt yt ) ,

t=1

where W0 is the present value of wealth, and pt is the price of the electricity.
We assume that consumers are forward-looking, and, for expositional purposes, we assume
they have perfect foresight. Finally, to illustrate the dynamics that can arise in our setting, we
assume utility is quadratic.4 Under these assumptions, the demand equation is:
yt = α1 yt−1 + α2 yt+1 + α3 pt ,

(A.3)

where the coefficients in equation (A.3) depend on the parameters of the quadratic utility function.
The “adjustment cost” model frequently estimated in the energy demand literature corresponds to
the special case where consumers are myopic, in which case the demand equation simplifies to:
yt = θ1 yt−1 + θ2 pt .

(A.4)

In the forward-looking model (A.3), consumers adjust their consumption in anticipation of
future price changes, which are implicitly captured by yt+1 . They do not do so in the myopic
adjustment model (A.4). Prior studies have noted that one can therefore test the myopic model by
testing whether demand responds to future prices (Becker et al., 1994; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001).
One can equivalently express demand as a function of all past and future prices by solving the
second-order difference equation (A.3):
yt =

t−1
X

δt−s pt−s +

∞
X

δt+s pt+s .

(A.5)

s=1

s=0

The effect of a price change on consumption will depend on whether the change was anticipated
and on how long consumers expect the price change to last. Given estimates of equation (A.5), the
long-run effect of a permanent change in price, p∗ , on consumption can then be calculated as
∞

t−1

X
X
dy
bt−s +

δ

dp∗

(A.6)

An appealing feature of equation (A.5) is that it is more flexible than equation (A.3). For
example, it will generate a valid estimate of dy/dp∗ even if consumers do not discount the future
exponentially. This non-parametric specification is rarely estimated, however, because most studies
do not have data panels of sufficient length.
4

Alternatively, to analyze dynamics near a steady state, one could allow utility to be general and take a linear
approximation to the first-order conditions, which would yield identical equations.

Derivations
As shown in Becker et al. (1994), the effect of a price change on consumption at a particular point
in time depends on whether or not the change was anticipated; when the change occurred; and
whether the change is temporary or permanent. This can be shown by solving the second-order
difference equation (A.3) to obtain:

Equation (A.7) shows that consumption in period t is a function of all future prices, all past

(A.7) becomes zero, so that consumption no longer depends on the initial condition, y0 . The longrun effect of a permanent change in price in all periods is

which corresponds to equation (A.6) as t → ∞.
It is straightforward to show that the solution to the first-order difference equation (A.4), the
myopic “adjustment cost” model, depends only on past prices, and not on future prices.

Significance levels: * 10 percent, ** 5 percent, *** 1 percent. Estimates are constructed by a nearest-neighbor
matching approach where each aggregation community is matched to non-aggregation communities with the most
similar usage in 2008 and 2009. The number of price observations corresponds to the number of observations for each
elasticity estimate, as we always observe usage where we observe a price change. Standard errors are in parentheses.
Standard error are determined by subsampling.

Electricity usage data come from ComEd. All other characteristics are from the 2005-2009 American Community
Survey. Number of observations in column (1) is smaller for median year built (285). Number of observations in
column (2) is smaller for median housing value (383). Estimates in columns (4) and (5) are weighted by the number
of times the control community is a match for a treated community.

matching approach where each aggregation community is matched to the five non-aggregation communities with the
most similar usage in 2008 and 2009. Months 0–2 are not shown as no aggregation community switches suppliers
that quickly following a referenda, resulting in price changes that are identically zero and undefined reduced-form
elasticities. The number of price observations corresponds to the number of observations for each elasticity estimate,
as we always observe usage where we observe a price change. Standard errors are in parentheses. Significance is

Significance levels: * 10 percent, ** 5 percent, *** 1 percent. The elasticities are interpreted as the cumulative
effect of a permanent one-percent price change on current usage. Estimates are constructed from a regression of log
usage changes on leads and lags of log price changes. The coefficients are constrained to match a four-parameter
model. Changes in log usage and log price are estimated using a nearest-neighbor matching approach where each
aggregation community is matched to the five non-aggregation communities with the most similar usage in 2008 and
2009. Standard errors are constructed via subsampling.

the Supplier for its Municipal Aggregation program. This includes a 24-month program with a fixed price
of $0.06533 per kilowatt hour (kWh) for the first 12 months (August 2015 to August 2016) and steps down to
$0.06065 per kWh for the last 12 months (August 2016 to August 2017). DES is an independent seller of
power and energy service and is certified as an Alternative Retail Electricity Supplier by the Illinois
Commerce Commission (ICC Docket No. 14-0336).
As an eligible residential or small business customer located in unincorporated portions of Kane County,
you will be automatically enrolled unless you opt out.
HOW TO OPT-OUT
You need do nothing to receive this new fixed rate. However, if you choose not to participate, simply
return the enclosed Opt-Out Card or call DES at 844-351-7691 by July 10, 2015. For more information,
visit www.DynegyEnergyServices.com or contact DES Customer Care at 866-694-1262 from 8:00am to
7:00pm Mon- Fri or via email at DESCustCare@Dynegy.com.
There is no enrollment fee, no switching fee, and no early termination fee. This is a firm, fixed all-inclusive
rate guaranteed until August 2017. This program offers automatic enrollment in Traditionally-sourced
Power, but you have an option of purchasing Renewable Power at a rate of $0.06766 per kWh for the first
12 months (August 2015 to August 2016) which steps down to $0.06327 per kWh for the last 12 months
(August 2016 to August 2017).
ENROLLMENT PROCESS
Once your account is enrolled, you will receive a confirmation letter from ComEd confirming your switch
to DES. A sample ComEd notice is attached. Approximately 30 to 45 days after enrollment you will
receive your first bill with your new DES price. Please review the enclosed Terms and Conditions for
additional information.
Please be advised you also have the option to purchase electricity supply from a Retail Electric Supplier
(RES) or from ComEd pursuant to Section 16-103 of the Public Utilities Act. Information about your
options can be found at the Illinois Commerce Commission website: www.pluginilllinois.org and
www.ComEd.com. You may request a list of all supply options available to you from the Illinois Power
Agency.

Notes: This figure displays the distribution of (log) price changes for aggregation communities relative to the contemporaneous ComEd price. Panel (a) provides a histogram of the initial aggregation rate and the corresponding ComEd
rate in the first month of the program for each community. Panel (b) plots the the difference between aggregation and
ComEd rates over time. The solid line displays the mean, and the dashed lines represent the 10th and 90th percentiles.

Notes: The reduced-form, time-dependent elasticity is estimated using a quadratic specification. Community-month
changes in log usage are regressed on changes in log price, where the log price changes are also interacted with
months since referendum and the square of months since referendum. These three parameters are used to construct
the estimated elasticity response curve as a function of time. Confidence intervals are constructed via subsampling.

Notes: Communities are split into seven groups based on the average two-year price change they experienced in the
first two years following their referenda. Elasticities are calculated separately for each group by pooling observations
in this two-year period and estimating equation (5). The graph shows no relationship between the estimated group
elasticity and the price change, mitigating concerns that the price change might be correlated with a community’s
elasticity of demand. Confidence intervals are constructed via subsampling.

Notes: The figure displays estimates of the mean usage effect for the eleven communities that pass aggregation but
never implement it. The effect is estimated relative to that community’s five nearest neighbors, as defined by the
difference-in-differences matching procedure outlined in the main text. The short dashed line indicates the median implementation date relative to when the referendum was passed. Confidence intervals are constructed via subsampling.

Notes: These panels display elasticity estimates for communities that are below and above median for the specified
characteristic. The estimates are from a reduced-form specification augmented with an interaction term for whether
the community is in the upper half of the distribution. The regressions include eight interactions simultaneously:
total population, housing units per capita, percent owner occupied, median year built, median income, percent with
bachelor’s degree, median age, and percent white. Coefficients significant at the 10 percent level are indicated by a
marker.
