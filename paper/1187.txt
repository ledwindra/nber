CAPITAL CONTROLS NID C)ERED INTEREST PARITY

ABSTRACT

This

paper examines covered interest parity between Yen—denominated and

dollar—denominated assets: Euro—yen and Euro—dollar three month deposit rates,

and the representative and comparable three—month interest rates in Japan and

in the U.S.

An objective of this paper is to single out the portion of

deviations from covered interest parity that is caused by capital controls
Imposed by the Japanese authority.

To that end, new measures of one—way

arbitrage gain are defined taking Into account transactions costs associated

with the bid—ask spread of exchange rates and the transactions tax on
repurchase agreements, Gensaki,

in Japan. According to our measure, covered

interest parity has been holding, as theory predicts, in the Euro market since
1977.

The Euro—Yen market must have been thin to have caused violations to

parity in 1975 and 1976.

Capital controls imposed by the Japanese Government

are detected by one—way arbitrage measures between l3ensaki in Japan and Euro-

Dollar deposits between 1975 and 1980.

After a new law was enacted in

December 1980 which lifted most capital controls, covered interest parity has
been holding between Gensaki and dollar—denominated assets.

INTRODUCTION

Covered interest arbitrage must equaHze net yields of assets denominated

in different currencies taking inte account the currency appreciation (or

depreciation) expressed in the forward—spot spread.

Since simultaneous

transactions in the spot and forward markets eliminate any risks in the
exchange rate fluctuations, covered interest parity is expected to hold in a
theoretical model with perfect capital mobility all the time.

However, it is

not so straightforward to establish covered interest parity empirically.1
Deviations observed in data can be attributed to one of the following reasons:

(I) transactions costs associated with information gathering and processing,
brokerage fees and commissions, and taxes on transactions;

(ii)

differences

in treatment of income taxes on yields from assets in different currency
denominations; (iii)
investments;

capital

controls in place on movement of short—term

(iv) default risk of an asset and political (country) risk of

future capita) controls; and (v) errors in (observed) variables.

An objective of this paper is to single out the portion of deviations
from covered interest parity that is caused by capital controls imposed by the

Japanese authority.

To that end, data are carefully selected to avoid the

problem of timing and errors in observat4ons.

Monthly data are cross—checked

with daily data, when possible, in order to make sure that they are on the
end of months basis.

Transactions costs associated with the bid—ask spread

and the transactions tax on repurchase agreements in Japan are taken into
account.2

Political risks due to the fear of future capital controls are

discussed but not explicitly analyzed in this paper.

II, A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAPANESE CAPITAL CONTROLS

Deregulation of Japanese capital controls came in several steps during
the 1970's and was completed by the new Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade
Control Law in December 1980.

Before 1974, most short—term capital flows in

and out of Japan were in general restricted.

No Japanese security companies

could buy foreign bonds, and no foreign companies could buy

Japanese

securities. However, subsequent fluctuations in the Yen were accompanied by

deregulation of capital controls.

When the Yen was depreciating quickly,

deregulation to encourage inflows of capital took place, and when the Yen was

rapidly appreciating, deregulation to encourage outflows of capital

was

introduced.5 For example, in the wak. of Yen depreciation, short—term
government securities became available to non—residents

in August 1974,

although their interest rate was (and still is) fixed at a level
the market rate.

lower than

In an attempt to stop a long process of Yen appreciation in

1977, Japanese security firms and others (with security firms' intermediation)

were allowed acquire foreign securities.

After hitting an all—time high in

late 1978, the Yen depreciated rapidly in 1979.

In that year,

it became

possible for foreign companies to purchase any Japanese securities in February

and to trade repurchase agreements in May.

In December 1980, the new law

became effective. Under the new law, capital flows in and out of Japan are
free with a few exceptions.6 Investing in foreign securities is allowed to
anybody without a security firm's intermediation;

foreign loans need only

prior reporting; non—residents can purchase and sell Japanese securities
without any licensing; non-residents can issue bonds in Japan with prior
reporting; and Japanese residents can open deposit accounts denominated in
foreign currencies with market—determined interest rates.

The series of important deregulations mentioned above is expected to make

it would not be surprising to find unexploited profit opportunities

before 1974. The band of deviations from parity should diminish between 1974
and 1980, and should be at a minimum after 1980. Since the U.S. did not have

notable capital controls after the 1970's, any arbitrage
involving the U.S. market should not show much deviation.

the capital controls in Japan were significantly relaxed in December 1980,

well as for the entire period from 1975 to 1983.

Since transactions costs are minimal and there are no capital controls in the

Euro markets, large deviations from par it>' in measure GAIN! are due to a thin

market or observational errors. Variability represented by standard deviations
of GAIN! is reduced after December 1980 to a level less than a half of what it

was between 1975 and December 1980.

This may be due to the increase in

capital flows after the 1980 deregulation and the resulting expansion of the
Euro—Yen market. Compared to the decrease in variability of GAIN1, changes in

standard deviations of GAIN2 and GAIN5 over the two sub—periods are drastic:

they are reduced by 90 '..

For the period after December 1980, standard

deviations of GAIN2 and GAIN! are very close to 0.25, and those of GAIN3 and

OAJN4 are equal at 0.466.

This suggests that deviations from parity were

because of capital controls before the new law came into effect in December
1980.

However, parity has been holding closely since 1981.

The large

standard deviations of GA1N2 and GAIN5 before December 1980 do not tell us
which way the deviations were directed.

Means of GAIN measures 2 through 5

show that investing in Yen—denominated assets were on average more profitable

than otherwise by a slight margin, but standard deviations are too large to
conclude this with confidence. A plot of a gain measure should be examined to

determine whether deviations from parity are Just random or are serially
correlated. Figure 2 shows how GAINS changes over time.

That was particularly true in the beginning of 1975 and

1978. As explained in section 2, the purchase of Gensaki was

allowed in May 1979, and other restrictions were lifted in December 1980. It
can be seen from Figure 2 and Table I that these deregulations seems to have

until we separate deviations

due to capital controls from those due to transactions costs

In the next

section, we will propose new measure of 'one—way arbitrage gain which is more
explicit than the idea of a band of neutrality.

IV. ARBITRAGE GAINS DUE TO CAPITAL CONTROLS

In this section, we define measures for arbitrage gain taking into

account explicitly the bid—ask spread for the exchange rates and the
transactions tax for the Gensaki asset. The exchange rate available to a
seller of Yen is not the same as the one to a buyer.

Therefore, a measure of

interest arbitrage gain should involve different exchange rates depending on
the direction of a flow

of

funds.

Covered interest parity implies that there

are no gains of arbitrage in either direction, which show up as non—positive

entries for the two one—way gain measures involving the same assets.

The

transactions tax for Gensaki depends on the instrument and on who is trading.

The loss on the annualized yield of Gensaki arrangements between a security
company and a client with Government bonds as an instrument is estimated to be

0.16 X, as explained in Ito (1983).

Therefore, the yield for RJA should be

reduced by 0.16.

Let us denote the ask rate of spot and forward exchange rates by GA and
FA, respectively. Then our new measures of arbitrage gains are defined in two
directions.

The arbitrage gain of a dollar—denominated asset over Yen—

denominated asset has a suffix A after the number of the gain measure, and
a gain measure in the reverse direction has a suffix B:

For example, GAIN2B measures whether an economic agent in the Euro market
currently holding three—month Euro—dollar deposits would rather invest in
three—month Gensaki in Tokyo.

Since GAINS and GAIN6 are gain measures which

do not involve transactions costs of foreign exchange, they are the same as in

the last section.

The means of these measures, therefore, are negative. Standard deviations
become smaller, indicating that any factors affecting covered interest parity
have become stable.

For example, transactions costs other than the bid—ask

suggest that the Euro Yen market was thin at that time.

Gain measures between Euro—Dollars and Gensaki, GIN2A and GAIN2B, show a
different picture.

The number of positive entries and means of GAIN2B before

1979 suggest that there were substantial unexploited profit opportunities from

the Euro market toward the Gensaki asset.

This was due to the capital

This suggests that deregulation of outflows

of capital in 1977 was not enough to •stablish parity, and that it was the new
law of 1980 which made parity hold.

There are two

possible reasons for this anomaly. First, prime industrial paper In the U.S.,

used for the representative short—term interest rate in the Morgan Guarantee
data bank, may not be the appropriate domestic instrument for studying covered

interest arbitrage.

However, the Gensaki rate, which is listed as the

representative short—term rate in the same source, is appropriate for Japan.

Second, additional transactions costs or default risk in connection with
international debt crisis may be responsible for the deviations. See Kreicher
(1982) for discussion of default risk and balance sheet constraints to explain

apparent deviations in the GAIN6 measure using the CD rate as domestic
interest rate.

great interest to see whether covered interect oroitrage was holding during

addition to using the bid—ask spread for the exchange rates, the bid—ask
spread for three—month deposit rates could be used.

Consider an arbitrage

operation of borrowing the Euro—Yen at the ask rate and investing in the Euro-

Dollar at the bid rate. The GAINIA measure is modified by replacing the Euro—

yen and Euro—dollar rates when used as the origins of arbitrage by their ask
rates denoted by EIJROYA and EURODA, respectively.

Krelcher (1982) used the

bid—ask spead of Euro—Dollar deposit rates in his calculation of one-way
arbitrage gains between the Euro—Dollar and CD rates in the U.S., which are
similar to GAIN6 of our definition. Our modified gain measures are defined as
follows:

The number of violations to parity and means and standard deviations of these

modified GAIN measures are shown in the third and fourth columns of Table 4.

According to the modified measures, covered interest arbitrage has been
holding more than 95 > of the time since 1981, and the accuracy is improving

over time.

One problem with these measures is that since the mean is

significantly different from

zero,

the modified measurE is probably too strong

in the sense that the marginal arbitrageurs in the market are not agents who
issue th. deposit certificates.

V.2 Experience in the Early 1970's
Th. end—of—month Gensaki series dates back only to 1975.

In order to

investigate covered interest parity during the turbulent years of the early
1970's, a substitute for the Gensaki rate Is sought.

A natural candidate is

the (interbank) Bill Discount ('Tegata') rate with a maturity of two to three

months.12

The Tegata rate differs from the Gensaki rate in three respects

(i) the series is taken as 'average over the month' as opposed to the 'end of

the month';

(ii) the interbank market is closed to nonresident investors

(except foreign banks); (iii) the maturity of the instrument is classified as

'two to three months' (and it is 'two manths since October 1980). With these

changes in mind, let us construct the modified gain measures, GAIN2T and
GAIN4T, replacing RJA (Gensaki) by TEGATA in the definitions of GAIN2 and
GAIN4, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates the fluctuations in GAIN2T between

1972 and 1982;
GAIN2T.

and GAIN4T which is not shown here looks very similar to

How closely the Tegata rate is related to the Gensaki rate can be

understood by comparing movements of GAIN2 and GAIN2T between 1975 and 1982.

The modified series is quite comparable with the original series for that
period in terms of direction of movements and the amplitude of fluctuations.

periods.

This period

by fluctuations with amplitudes much wider than in later

For example, in December 1973, GAIN2T became 30X.

In that month

Tegata was 11.192Y. and EUROD was 10.13 X, while the spot rate was Y280/$ and

the forward rate was Y320/$.

This is in contrast to the case in February

1973, when GAIN2T was belv —lOX, The Japanese interest rates were determined

quite independently from the forward premium (expected depreciation of Yen,
I..., S < F) and the Euro—dollar interest rate. Most of thes. fluctuations in

GAIN2T can be attributed to the fluctuations In the forward premium or
discount, with comparable Interest rates. These are sufficient evidence that
in the early 1970's, the Japanese capital market was isolated from the rest of

the world, as conjectured in Section 2. Any unexploited gains from arbitrage
in these periods were due to capital controls which made Japanese instruments
unavailable to non—residents and placed strong restrictions on the acquisition
of

foreign

securities by the Japanese.

VI, CONCLUDING REIiRKS
This paper examines covered interest parity between Yen—denominated and
dollar—denominated assets.

We propose a measure of one—way arbitrage gain

which singles out the deviations from parity due to capital controls.
According to our measure, covered interest parity has been holding, as theory

predicts, in the Euro market since 1977.

The Euro—Yen market must have been

thin to have caused violations to parity in 1975 and 1976.

SInce 1977, the

standard deviations of the measure have been reduced gradually.

14

This is

confirmed in daily data as well as monthly data.
In order to consider capital controls imposed by the Japanese Government,

measures of one—way arbitrage gains between the Gensaki and Euro—dollar assets

are examined from 1975 to 1983.

The measure shows apparent unexploited

arbitrag. gains between 1975 and 1978.

In particular, strong arbitrage gains

existed in 1978 in the direction from Euro—Dollars to Sensaki. This is caused

both by capital controls, in that non—residents were not allowed to purchase
Gensaki, and by the low interest rate policy, in that assets available to non—

residents had interest rates lower than the market (Gensaki) rate.

After

Gensaki became available to non—residents in May 1979 and the new Foreign
Exchange Law became effective in December 1980, one—way arbitrage gains have
almost disappeared, showing that these institutional changes were successful
in establishing smooth short—term capital flows in and out of Japan.

Using the Tegata rate, a measure of arbitrage gain is extended back to
1972. The large fluctuations of the measure from 1973 to 1974 are due to very
strict capital controls before 1974.

To sum up, we found in this paper that Japanese capital controls in place

caused deviations from covered interest parity during 1972 to 1979.

Gradual

deregulation of capital controls from 1975 to 1980 contributed to smaller
standard deviations in measures of arbitrage gains. Allowing non—residents to
purchase Gensaki in May 1979 and the across—the—board deregulation of capital
flows in December 1980 made significant changes in the behavior of measures of

one—way arbitrage gains. Since January 1981, we have seldom observed positive
unexploited arbitrage left in the market.

theoretical model but he considers purchasing power parity rather than covered
interest parity.

3.

The Japanese deregulation of capital controls is in contrast to that in

France which is described in Frankel (1982).

Strictly speaking, we cannot

reject an alternative interpretation that the deviations result 4rom the
combination of capital controls already in place with a fear of the imposition
of additional capital controls.

4.

Otani and Tiwari (1981) use a definition of transactions costs which Is

broader than ours. Their transactions costs Include 'not only brokerage fees

but also costs in terms of taxes, search time, political risks, and ways in
which market participants need to maneuver around any capital controls.'

5.

However, there were a few occasions when controls were tightend, only to

be deregulated shortly. See Otani (1981; Appendix) for details.

FOOTNOTES-i

6.

The law specifies various conditions under which controls can be

reimposed: a dangerously unstable Yen; a threat to domestic capital markets,

monetary policy, or balance of payments; a substantial threat to a domestic
industry; or the inability of Japan to meet international agreements.

7.

See appendices for the reasons we select these data and sources and

definitions of data.

8.

Most of the studies of interest rate parity use the difference between

the on—shore and off—shore interest rates.

Euro—Yen and Gensaki rates

Otani and Tiwari (1981) compared

Claassen and Wyplosz (1982) studied the

difference between the domestic Franc and Euro—Franc rates. It was the German
Mark in

9.

Frankfurt

and Zurich on which Dooley and Isard (1980) focused.

Although the name of 'one—way arbitrage is adopted from Deardorff, our

definition is slightly different from

his.

We mean by one—way arbitrage a

one—directional arbitrage between three—month assets denominated in home
currency and an a set of operations consisting of selling home currency in the

spot market, investing in foreign assets, and buying home currency in the
forward market.

Deardorff considered an arbitrage between buying

foreign

currency in the spot market and a set of operations consisting of investing
(lending) In an asset denominated in home currency, selling home currency in
the forward market, and selling short (borrowing) a foreign asset. Since both

usages express the same phenomenon, cov•red interest arbitrage, our modified
usage is appropriate.
