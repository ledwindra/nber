    "abstract": "\n\nGlobalization, in the form of financial flows, which is always advantageous on an aggregative level, typically creates winners and losers, if left exclusively to market forces. The paper demonstrates that typical welfare-state redistribution policies, governed by a majority of the population, spreads the globalization\u2019s gains from trade to all income groups, even those who are low skilled and have small capital endowments. Therefore, financial globalization of a welfare-state economy generates a Pareto improvement.\n\n",
