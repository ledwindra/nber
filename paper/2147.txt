Are Cyclical Fluctuations in Productivity
Due More to Supply Shocks or Demand Shocks?

ABSTRACT

Measured productivity is strongly procyclical. Real business cycle theories
suggest that actual fluctuations in productivity are the source of
fluctuations in aggregate output. Keynesian theories maintain that
fluctuations in aggregate output come from shocks to aggregate demand.
Keynesian theories appeal to labor hoarding or off the production function
behavior to explain the procyclicality of productivity. If observed
productivity shocks are true productivity shocks, a function of factor
prices should covary exactly with productivity. In annual data for U.S.
industries, that function of factor prices and conventionally-measured
productivity move together very closely. Moreover, their difference is
uncorrelated with aggregate output.

Productivity plays a central role in the business cycle. Measured
productivity varies positively with output. The procyclicality of
productivity is a focus of recent debates over the sources of economic

fluctuations. Real business cycle theories take shocks in productivity as a
source of business cycles.1 (See Kydland and Prescott (1982), Long and
Plosser (1983), Prescott (1986), and Shapiro (1986)). These theories
explain the joint movement of output and measured productivity virtually by
definition.

Keynesian theories, on the other hand, attribute the business cycle to

demand shocks. Such shocks include changes in fiscal policy, taste,
velocity, and autonomous investment or animal spirits. Keynesian theories
must explain the procyclical fluctuation in productivity. The sticky wage
version of the Keynesian model found in the General Theory and more recently
in models of overlapping contracts (see Fischer (1977) for example) do not

explain procyclical productivity. In these models, firms are always on
their demand for labor schedules. Hence, shocks to output demand would
reduce the marginal product of labor and lead to counter-cyclical

productivity. The counter-cyclicality of productivity in sticky wage models
is the dual of the counter-cyclicality of real wages. That unsatisfactory
feature of the sticky wage model has been widely discussed since the DunlopTarshis -Keynes debate.

The Keynesian explanation for procyclical productivity is that firms do
not adjust their labor input in light of short run fluctuation in demand

because it is too costly to do so. This leads to "labor hoarding" or short
run "off the production function" behavior. Such behavior on the part of

-2-

firms need not be irrational, but can be motivated by complications in the
production technology (costs of adjustment, overhead labor) not captured in

standard short run production functions. Such behavior also provides part
of the theoretical underpinnings of Okun's Law.

(See Dornbusch and Fischer

(1981, pp. 368-371) for a Keynesian account of procyclical productivity.)

Hall, in an important series of papers (l986a, b, c), reinterprets the

finding that productivity is procyclical. If a demand shock can lead to an
increase in output with little increase in input, then marginal cost must be

low. Competitive firms with the ability to increase output with little
increase in input would cut price. Demand would increase and hence

attenuate

-

the procyclicality of measured productivity. Hence, Hall

interprets the procyclicality of productivity as evidence that firms behave

monopolistically and that they have consistent excess capacity. Hall's
explanation is within the standard Keynesian tradition discussed in the
previous paragraph, although it is important and distinct in its

implications for market structure. Yet in either Hall's or the textbook
Keynesian model, cyclical fluctuations in productivity arise from shocks to
aggregate demand rather than shocks to true productivity.

In this paper, I attempt to test whether observed fluctuations in
productivity are more from supply (real business cycles) or from demand (the

Keynesian theory). To do so, I appeal to data on product and factor prices.
Prices should provide an independent indication of the source of the

productivity fluctuations. Implementations of real business cycle models
have been criticized for neglecting their predictions about factor prices
despite their strong implications for them (see Suinniers (1986)). In this

-3-

paper, I ask whether the observed fluctuations in factor prices are
consistent with hypothesis that measured productivity shocks are true

productivity shocks. Further, I ask whether departures from the predicted
joint movement of measured productivity and factor prices are consistent
with Keynesian alternatives.

I. Productivity and Prices
Productivity is measured here as the percent change of the residual in

the value-added production function. Consider a constant returns to scale

production function with Hicks-neutral technological progress. Output, Y,
is a function of labor, Nt, and capital, K:

—

(1)

f(N,K)E

The level of the true productivity shock is denoted E. Solow (1957) shows

that the percent change in the shock E (denoted &) can be measured from
observed data. Taking logarithmic time derivatives of (1), setting the
marginal product of labor equal to the real wage, and applying Euler's Law

for linearly homogenous functions yields Solow's famous residual

—

(2)

The

—

wage and

WtN/PY

- Akt)

- Ak)

is the share of labor income in nominal output (Wt is the

the price level) and the time derivative of the logarithm of a

variable Z is denoted Az. In the empirical work, these are approximated

-4-

as logarithmic differences. Solow's residual is a measure of the percent
change in total factor productivity for any constant returns to scale
technology; for it to be a valid measure, only labor need be paid its
marginal product.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the measured Solow
residual is a true shift in the production function or whether it has a

demand component as Keynesian theories suggest. In the next section, I
outline how data on prices help distinguish between these competing

hypotheses. Before considering the precise implications of the competing
hypotheses, it is worthwhile to examine the basic co-movements of prices and
measured productivity.

Table 1 gives the correlation of the Solow residual with rates of
change of aggregate GNP, of prices, and of wages for industries in the U.S.

economy.2 The first column gives the correlation of the Solow residual with
aggregate CNP growth, the second column gives the correlation with the
growth in the industry price divided by the GNP deflator, and the third
column

gives the

correlation with growth in the real wage (compensation per

manhour divided by industry price). The first column indicates that
measured productivity growth varies positively with aggregate output growth.

The

procyclicality is particularly strong in aggregate and in manufacturing.

Construction

is an interesting exception. Even though its output moves

with aggregate output, its productivity is acyclical.
For virtually every industry, and for the aggregate economy, the

strongly

changes in measured productivity are negatively correlated with real price

growth. This finding is closely related to Houthakker's (1979) that price

-5-

growth and output growth are negatively correlated in industry data. The
negative correlation of price growth and the Solow residual provides some
evidence that the industry level shocks to productivity are shocks to

supply. Nonetheless, this evidence is only suggestive. Keynesian models
with sticky prices have no restriction in general on the price-productivity

correlation. Moreover, it is difficult to interpret the correlation if
there are aggregate shocks to true productivity. If a productivity shock
hits all industries equally, it may not change relative output prices.

Hence, the price-productivity correlations, although they suggest that
idiosyncratic supply shocks are important, are not helpful in studying the
sources of cyclical fluctuation in industry productivity.

Fluctuations in the real (product) wage should, on the other hand, shed

light on whether there are aggregate shocks to productivity. Specifically,
real wages should increase if productivity increases either

idiosyncratically or in aggregate. In Table 1, the correlation of real wage
growth and the Solow residual is almost always positive. Hence, the data
admit the possibility that the observed fluctuations in productivity are

indeed from supply. In the next section, I outline a dual approach to
measuring factor productivity that uses the factor price data. There is a
price-based measure of productivity that should be identical to the Solow
residual if the measured Solow residual is a true shock to the production

function. In the subsequent section, I apply these measurements to the data
to see whether movements in the two measures are similar. I also study
whether their deviations are cyclical as Keynesian alternatives suggest.

-6II. Dual Measurement of Productivity
Under almost the same conditions that Solow uses to derive his famous
residual, it is possible to derive an alternative one based on factor
prices.

If a firm has a constant returns to scale technology such as that given
in equation (1), it will have a cost function C(.) of the following form:

(3)

C(Y,W,R) —

g(WR)

Y/E

Here, Rt is the rental rate of capital. The function g(.) is, of course,
linearly homogenous. Shephard's lemma gives conditional factor demand

equation. Defining marginal cost as X,

(4)

X Cy(Y,W,R) — g(WR)

E.

/

To derive an expression for the productivity shock in terms of the dual, we

follow identical steps as with the production function. Logarithmic
differentiation of (4) yields

where

is the percent change in the marginal cost. Shephard's lemma

Using Euler's Law, substituting into equation (5), and setting price equal

to marginal cost yields the standard pricing equation. Denote the percent
change in the wage as

a (w

-

+ (l-a)

(Are - Ape)

where the price-based measurement of the productivity shock is labeled Lc
to distinguish it from the Solow residual

defined in (2).

This productivity residual is derived under almost as general

assumptions as is Solow's. The only extra assumption made is that capital
is paid its marginal product within the period. This assumption is clearly
unrealistic because of costs of adjustment and time to build. It can be
relaxed at some cost in generality. Suppose that changes in capital must be
decided at least one period in advance. Then marginal cost becomes
simply

0

-8-

The derivative of labor with respect to output will be a function of the

capital stock, the level of output, and the productivity shock. Equation
(10) can be logarithmically differentiated and an expression similar to (9)

can be derived. Unfortunately, to obtain an analytic expression, it is
necessary to parameterize the production function. The ensuing result is
not as general as (9). Suppose that the production function is constant
elasticity of substitution (CES) so

(11)

—

[(l-a)K

where a is a distribution parameter and p is a parameter such that l/(l-p)
is the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. For the Cobb-

Douglas case (pO), the dual measure of productivity growth becomes

(1-a)

-

k)

In the general CES case, it is

(13)

—

[a(w

+

-

k)]/(lp(lat))

These expressions are similar to (9). They are still importantly dependent
on the real wage. Instead of the term in the cost of capital, they have
terms that reflects the marginal product of capital in terms of quantities.

These capture the short run increasing marginal cost due to the fixity of

capital. Kydland and Prescott (1982) assume that the change in the capital

-9-

stock is pre-determined and that the production function is Cobb-Douglas, so
it seems appropriate to consider that case here.3

II. Primal versus Dual Productivity: Empirical Findings
There are two ways to measure productivity change: the standard,
output-based measure and the dual, price-based measure. Under the null
hypothesis that the measured changes in productivity are true changes in
productivity, these measures should be identical except for measurement
errors or specification errors from incorrect parameterization of the

production function. In this section, I compare these two measures.
Moreover, I study whether the two measures depart from each other in a way

that would be predicted by a Keynesian alternative. Under such an
alternative, the Solow residual moves independently with aggregate demand.

Cyclical fluctuations in quantity-based productivity occur because firms

hoard labor or are off their production functions. Under the Keynesian
alternative, the cyclical fluctuations in the quantity-based measure of
productivity have nothing to do with the true productivity of the factors of
production, so factor prices should not move in response to these cyclical

fluctuations. Hence, the deviation of the quantity-based and price-based
measures should be cyclical under the Keynesian alternative.
Consider first a regression of the Solow residual

residual

on the dual

and a constant. Under the null hypothesis that the two

productivity measurements are equal, the slope coefficient and the R2 should

both equal one. For aggregate manufacturing, using the unrealistic

- 10

specification
follows

(14)

-

that capital is flexible (equation (9)), the estimates are as

4

— 0.03 + 0.79

s.e.e.—3.0l,

,

D.W.—1.95, R2—O.13

(0.95) (0.35)

Even in this specification, the hypothesis that the slope coefficient is one
cannot be rejected although the fraction of variance explained is very low.

Ignoring the short run fixity of capital understates the variability of

marginal cost. In the Cobb-Douglas specification (equation (12)), the
results are as follows5:

(15)

= -0.31 + 1.10

,

s.e.e.—l.58,

D.W.—2.03, R2=0.76

(0.34) (0.11)

The slope coefficient is close to one and fairly tightly estimated.

Moveover, variation in the factor prices explains about three-fourth the

variance in the quantity-based measure. Finally, in a CES specification
with p constrained to equal -l (elasticity of substitution equal to 0.5),
the estimates are:

(16)

= 0.54 + 0.88

,

s.e.e.=l.23,

D.W.=1.98, R2=0.86

(0.22) (0.07)

Again the slope coefficient is precisely estimated to be close to one and

the R2 is very high. Therefore, in the specifications where the short run

- 11

fixity

-

of capital is taken into account, the two measures of productivity

appear to be very similar.

Now consider the prediction of a Keynesian alternative where movements

in measured Solow residuals are accounted for by movements in demand. This
alternative can be tested directly by including a measure of demand, say the

growth rate of aggregate GNP. We know from Table 1 that a regression of GNP
growth alone on manufacturing productivity explains about half of the

variance of measured productivity. Because the Cobb-Douglas and the case
with lower elasticity of substitution yield similar results, only the

results for Cobb-Douglas are presented. They are as follows:

(17) E — -0.63

+ 0.92 A1
(0.42) (0.18)

+ 0.21 GNP , s.e.e.—l.57,

D.W.—1.86, R2—0.77

(0.17)

The addition of GNP growth adds almost nothing to the explanatory power of

the equation. Moreover, the null hypothesis that the coefficient on

is

one and the coefficient on ACNPt is zero cannot be rejected (the F(2,33)
1.25 statistic has marginal significance 0.30).

In the Cobb-Douglas case, the difference of
-

(wtApt)].

and

is simply

Hence, imposing the restriction that the slope

coefficient in equation (17) is one yields a regression of the difference of

labor productivity and real wage growth on aggregate output growth. This

difference, as equation (17) indicates, is not cyclical. When the
restriction is imposed on equation (17), the coefficient of aggregate GNP
growth remains insignificant and the equation has a R2 of only 0.07.

- 12

-

Table 2 gives similar results for all the industries studied. The
first column reports the estimated slope coefficient for equation (15), that
is a regression of the Solow residual on the Cobb-Douglas dual residual.

Many of the point estimates are close to one and precisely estimated. In
about a quarter of the estimates, it is possible to reject the null

hypothesis. The final two columns give the fraction of variance in
explained by either

or by GNPt.6 In general, a much higher fraction is

explained by the prices than by aggregate output. The result reported in
equation (17) of the text holds for many industries: the deviation of the
two productivity measures is acyclical.

III. Discussion
Productivity can be measured by either prices or quantities. If
measured productivity is equal to true productivity, these two measures

should be identical. Indeed, the two measures are very closely related: for
the aggregate and for most industries, the coefficient of the dual measure
in a regression of the primal is precisely estimated to be one; the fraction

of variance explained by dual measure is high. Of course, the estimated
is not exactly unity as the theory predicts, but the deviations from that
value can easily be attributed to specification and measurement errors.
More importantly, the deviation of the two measures is not cyclical.
Under the hypothesis that the coefficient of

is one in equation (17),

which cannot be rejected for two-thirds of the industries, equation (17) can
be interpreted as a regression of the difference of labor productivity and

real wage growth rates on aggregate output growth. Keynesian theories of

- 13

labor

-

hoarding or of monopolistic excess capacity predict that measured

labor productivity is procyclical. Output can increase autonomously from an
increase in inputs when demand increases. Because true productivity is not
increasing, there is no reason to expect an equal increase in the product

wage. In the absence of a Keynesian theory that has the real wage as a
better proxy for demand shocks than is aggregate GNP growth, it seems very
hard to reconcile the findings in this paper with theories that make changes
in conventionally measured productivity a consequence of fluctuations in

aggregate demand. A possible Keynesian explanation of procyclical
productivity is monopolistic theories with rent sharing arrangements. Such
theories would require marginal cost to rise precisely with the rise in
observed labor productivity.

The results need to be somewhat qualified. The two measures of
productivity are not exactly the same. In a few industries, the supply
shock story fails importantly. More importantly, the data used in this
paper are annual. Perhaps rigidities such as sticky prices and labor
hoarding are confined to operate within the year. Further tests are needed
on data of higher frequency. Nonetheless, if these Keynesian phenomena are
indeed confined to operate over a horizon of a year, the supply shock model
has explained much of the conventionally-defined business cycle.

FOOTNOTES

1Given the finding that most of the variance of output changes is

explained by a permanent component (see Campbell and Mankiw (1987)), it is

necessary to clarify what is meant by the business cycle. Here, a variable
is said to be cyclical if it moves positively with innovations in aggregate
output.

2The data are from the annual U.S. National Income and Product Accounts

from 1950 to 1985; they are revised as of July 1986. Data on output,
deflators, wages, and hours are taken from section six of the NIPA (see

Survey of Current Business, July 1986, for example). The capital stock are
from the revised industry level data (see Survey of Current Business, August

1986). See Shapiro (1987) for details about the data.
3They also consider inventories, which are ignored here.

4The rental price of capital is calculated as
=
where & is the average depreciation rate (0.125 for manufacturing),

v

the required rate of return (measured by the dividend-price ratio on the
Standard and Poor's Composite), z in the present discounted value of
depreciation allowances,

is the investment tax credit rate, and

corporate profits tax rate. The variables z and

is the

are computed by DRI.

Note that if this measure of profits were found in the national accounts,

which of course it is not, equation (14) would be tautologous. As Hall
