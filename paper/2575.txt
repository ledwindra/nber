The Information in the Term Structure: Some Further Results

ABSTRACT

This paper provides some refinements and updating of Fama's (1984)
evidence on the information in the term structure about future spot

interest rate movements. First, it uses econometric techniques that
properly correct standard errors for overlapping data and for conditional

heteroscedasticity. Second, it makes use of a new data set that has some
potential advantages over Fama's and which has more recent data.

Overall, the results are in broad agreement with those of Fama. The term
structure does help predict spot interest rate moventents several months

into the future. Indeed, updating Fama's results indicates that the
forecast power of forward rates is generally higher during the October
1982 to June 1986 period than it was during the sample periods Fama examined.

I. Introduction

In a recent important paper, Fama (1984) resurrects the view that
the term structure of interest rates contains information about the

future movements of spot interest rates. Using ordinary least squares
estimation, Fama finds evidence that the forward rate—spot rate
differential helps predict changes in the spot rate, while the difference

between adjacent maturity nrward rates helps predict the future
one-month changes in the spot rate.

This paper provides some refinements of Fama's regression evidence.
First, it uses econometric techniques that properly correct standard
errors for overlapping data and for conditional heteroscedasticity.
Second, it uses an econometric procedure which can exploit additional

information in the term structure. Finally, it makes use of a new data
set that has some potential advantages over Fama's and which has more
recent data.'

II. The Methodology and Data

In examining the information in the term structure about future
movements in spot interest rates, Fama runs the following ordinary least
squares (OLS) regressions:

Because of the resulting serial correlation, the OLS

A solution to this problem is provided by Hansen and 1{odrick (1980)

who develop the following consistent estimate of the variance—covariance

matrix of the parameter estimates.

Recause researchers have found that interest rate volatility has
changed markedly in the postwar sample period that Fama examined, the
error terms in equations (1) and (2) are likely to be conditionally

heteroscedastic.2 To obtain correct standard errors when there is
conditional heteroscedasticity, the Ilansen—ilodrick variance-covariance

matrix needs to be modified using the method described by White (1980).

This involves redefining w(i,j) to be,
(5)

2There is some evidence for conditional heteroscedasticity in the
regression equations here, but it is not always very stronj. In Fama's
February 1959 to July 1982 sample period when t = 2, for example, White's
(1980) test for c2nditional heteroscedasticity yields a test statistic
(distributed as x (1)) of 3.65. This statistic indicates a rejection of
conditional hoinoscedasticity at the 10% level but not at the 5% level.
On the other hand, Engl&s (1982) test for autoregressive conditional
heteroscedasticity, in which squared residuals are regressed on one lag
of the squared residuals, provides strong evidence for conditional
heteroscedasticity: in the February 1959 to July 1982 sam?le period when
t = 2, the lagrange multiplier statistic (distributed as x (1)) equals
21.95 which is highly significant. To check on the robustness of the
results, I also have calculated the standard errors for the coefficients
of regressions (1) and (2) under the assumption of conditional
homoscedasticity. Although the calculated standard errors do sometimes
differ appreciably from those found in the text (sometimes larger and
sometimes smaller), the conclusions from these results are the same as
the conclusions discussed in the text.

4

A problem with the Ifansen—Jiodrick estimate of the variance-

covariance matrix and the variant allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity is that it need not be positive—definite in finite samples.
In practice this means that standard errors of coefficients and test

statistics may turn out to be negative. Newey and West (1985) have
proposed a solution to this problem which involves down-weighting the
off-diagonal elements of the

matrix to produce a consistent estimate

of the variance-covariance matrix which is guaranteed to be

positive—definite. The Newey-West estimate of the variance-covariance
matrix allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity calculates the w1(i,j)
elements of

otherwise

information is available in the term structure that is
not being used in ordinary least squares estimation because
Additional

contemporaneous errors in forecasting changes in the spot rate may be

highly correlated for different t's. Therefore, seemingly unrelated
regression (SIJR) estimates of the system of equations with different t's
may produce substantial gains in efficiency. Indeed in other research on
the information in the term structure, Ilishkin (1987) finds that taking
into account the

in

cross-equation correlation of the error terms resulted

the estimated standard errors of coefficients falling by over 50%.
The SUR standard error estimates will again be incorrect because of

the serial correlation of the error terms. The Hansen—Hodrick,
Newey-West estimate of the variance—covariance matrix allowing for

S

conditional heteroscedasticity can be generalized to apply to a seemingly
unrelated regression system of & equations as follows. The StJR method
assumes that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals is

Using the Choleski decomposition Xl =

P'P,

we get the GLS (i.e.,

the SUR) estimates by premultiplying the system by PHI,. and then proceed

with OLS estimation. Allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity, the
Mansen-Hodrick variance—covariance matrix of the parameter estimates of
the transformed system is then,

As in Fama (1984), the end-of-month Treasury bill rate data was
obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the
University of Chicago and the one—month bill was defined to have a
maturity of 30.4 days, the two—month bill 60.8 days, on up to the six

month bill with a maturity of 182.5 days. For each defined maturity the
interest rate was interpolated from the bills that were closest to the

defined maturity. In effect, this means that the slope of the term
structure is assumed to be constant between these two bills. Fama (1984)
instead chooses a bill that has a maturity closest to six months and then
keeps on taking the interest rate from this same bill every month as its
maturity shortens in order to get interest rates on one to six-month

bills. In effect, Fama is assuming that the slope of the term structure
is zero around the desired maturity of the bill. The procedure used here

7

which assumes the slope around the desired maturity is constant rather
than zero is less restrictive, which is an advantage when you are
examining the ability to predict future spot rate movements as in this

paper. However, Fama's procedure makes use of actual transaction price
data, which is an advantage when you are focusing on predicting future
premiums as in his paper.

III. The Results

Table 1, which corresponds to Fama's (1984) Table 4, shows the

estimated r,

their

standard errors and the R2's for regression equation

(1), which regresses the change in the spot rate on the forward-

spot differential. The first six rows contain the results for the sample
periods in Fama (1984), and the coefficient estimates are typically quite

close to those found there. The standard errors of the coefficients,
however, are sometimes quite different from those found in Fama (1984))
For example, in Fama's full sample period, February 1959 to July 1982,
the standard errors of the coefficients for t = 2 to 6 were .07, .10,

.12, .10, and .10; the corresponding standard errors in the first row of
Table I are .11, .18, .24, .15, and .11, which are larger and in one case

is twice as large.4 In general, however, the conclusion from the results

3This stems from the estimation technique and not from the
modification of Fain's data set. Ordinary least squares estimates wtth
the modified data set used here produced standard error estimates that
were very close to those reported in Fama (1984).

is similar to Fama's. In all cases, the forward rate-spot differential
for one month ahead, F2t -

R÷1,

has significant predictive power for the

change in the spot rate one month ahead, Rt+2 -

R÷i.

The forward-spot

differential also has significant explanatory power for changes in spot
rates further out in the future, although the number of significant
B-coefficients (five) is le-s than in Fama's Table 4 (nine).
The last four rows of Table 1 contain results for a longer sample

period than Fama's, January 1959 to June 1986 and for three subperiods
January 1959 to September 1979, October 1979 to September 1982, and

October 1982 to June 1986. These subperiods are examined because the
Federal Reserve altered its techniques of monetary control in October
1979 and October 1982 and because previous research [Huizinga and Ilishkin

(1986) and Roley (1986fl have documented shifts in the stochastic process

of interest rates in October 1979 and October 1982. The results in these
sample periods indicate that forward rates do have predictive power for

spot rates several months in the future. The D—coefficient estimates for
one, two and three mouths in the future (I

=2

to 4) are statistically

significant at the 1% level in both the pre-October 1979 and post-October

1982 sample periods. However, since the B-coefficient estimates for t =
2 to 4 are higher in the October 1979to September 1982 period than in

the pre-October 1979 period, the failure to find statistical significance
when t = 3 and 4 in the October 1979 to September 1982 period is probably

it is not always-the case that the estimated standard

Fama's Table 4.

due to the shortness of the sample period, which is only three years

long. Indeed, the p-coefficient estimates are generally higher in both
the post—October 1979 periods than in the pre—October 1979 period, as are

the R2's of the regressions. These results provide some support to the
conclusion in liardouvelis (1986) that the term structure has more

predictive power for spot rates after October 1979 than before.
Table 2 provides Wald tests for whether the coefficients remain
unchanged in Fama's five subperiods and the three subperiods with breaks

in October 1979 and October 1982. The tests do not indicate that the
coefficients change over Fama's five subperiods; the marginal
significance levels of the test statistics are quite high, indicating
that the probability of obtaining the value of the test statistic or
higher under the null hypothesis that the coefficient estimates are equal

in the five periods is high. The tests for whether the coefficients
change in October 1979 and October 1982 do provide some evidence that the
a and

coefficients shift when t

= 2 or 3. However, tests for changes

in the p—coefficients alone do not provide significant rejections of the

equality of the n—coefficients in the three subperiods. Overall, there
is little support for instability of the information in the term

structure about future spot rate movements. However, it should be
recalled that the Wald tests reported here may not have very great
statistical power, and in addition, there is some evidence that for one
and two months in the future, the information in the term structure did
change with the shift in the Federal Reserve's operating procedures in
October 1979 and October 1982.

The results on the marginal predictive power of forward rates on the
one-month changes in future spot rates is obtained from the equation (2)

regression of the future one—month changes in the spot rate, Rt+ -

on the forward rate spread, Ft -

F(t—i).

Table 3 (which

corresponds to Fama's (1984) Table 5) provides the n-coefficients, their

standard errors and the R2's for these regressions. Although the results
are similar to those of Fama (1984), they are slightly less favorable to
the view that the term structure has marginal predictive power for

changes in the spot rate that are more than one month in the future. For
two months ahead or more Ct > 3), only four n-coefficients are
significant and positive in the Faoa sample periods and one coefficient

is even significantly negative; in contrast, Fama found six significant

positive coefficients and no significant negative coefficients. The
results for the post-October 1982 sample period, however, provide
additional evidence that the term structure has marginal predictive power

for changes in the spot rate more than one month in the future. The
results in the last row of Table 3 indicate that forward rate spreads
provide significant predictive power for the change in the spot rate up
to three months in the future (r C 4), a result also found in Hardouvelis
(1986).

Table 4 which provides tests for shifts in the coefficients of the
Table 3 regressions suggests that there is more coefficient instability
for the marginal prediction equations of Table 3 than there were for the
regressions in Table 1.

In the first row of the table, there are two

significant rejections of the equality of the n—coefficients in the Fama

subperiods; while the last two rows of the table indicate that for I =

2, 3 and 4 there are significant shifts in the coefficients in October
1979 and October 1982.

Tables S and 6 provide the seemingly unrelated regression (SUB)
estimates of the n-coefficients for the regression equations (1) and (2).
In contrast to results in Nishkin (1987) which finds large gains in
efficiency from SUB estimation when examining the information in the term
structure about future inflation, the estimated standard errors do not

decline substantially when SUB estimation is used here.5 An explanation
for the lack of success of the seemingly unrelated regression tecluiiqae

to produce large gains in efficiency is that the error terms of the
regression equations examined here are not that highly correlated across

equations. The contemporaneous correlations of the error terms across
equations in the Table S regressions ranges from .4 to .9, while the

correlations are near zero for the Table 6 regressions. Not
surprisingly, then, the Tables S and 6 results are very similar to those
found in Tables I and 3.

IV. Conclusion

This paper provides some refinements and updating of Faina's (1984)

evidence on the information in the term

structure

about future spot

interest rate movements. Overall, the results are in broad agreement
with those of Fama. The term structure does help predict spot interest
rate movements several months into the future. Indeed, updating Fama's

5lndeed, in some cases the estimated standard errors are higher in
Tables S and 6 than they are in Tables 1 and 3. Even though the SUB
estimates are asymptotically more efficient than OLS estimates, in small
samples estimated SUR standard errors can turn out to be larger than OLS
standard errors.

higher during the October 1982 to June 1985 period than it was during the
sample periods Fania examined.
