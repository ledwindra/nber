Illegal Immigration, State Law, and Deterrence
Mark Hoekstra and Sandra Orozco-Aleman
NBER Working Paper No. 20801
December 2014
JEL No. J6,K37
ABSTRACT
A critical immigration policy question is whether state and federal policy can deter undocumented
workers from entering the U.S. We examine whether Arizona SB 1070, arguably the most restrictive
and controversial state immigration law ever passed, deterred entry into Arizona. We do so by exploiting
a unique data set from a survey of undocumented workers passing through Mexican border towns
on their way to the U.S. Results indicate the bill’s passage reduced the flow of undocumented immigrants
into Arizona by 30 to 70 percent, suggesting that undocumented workers from Mexico are responsive
to changes in state immigration policy. In contrast, we find no evidence that the law induced undocumented
immigrants already in Arizona to return to Mexico.

1. Introduction
Current estimates indicate there are nearly 12 million undocumented immigrants living in
the U.S (Passel, Cohn and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2013). There exists considerable debate regarding
how to address this issue—options range from deportation to amnesty—as well as how to reduce
the flow of undocumented workers into the U.S. With respect to reducing illegal immigration,
there are two general types of policies. The first is improving border security directly through
the increased use of fencing, aircraft, border patrol, and other measures. The second – and less
direct – policy is to lower the expected benefits from being in the U.S. illegally, thereby
deterring entry. Some of these policies target labor demand by imposing penalties on employers
of undocumented workers, while others target labor supply by imposing penalties on
undocumented workers themselves.
While there is a large literature examining the determinants and impacts of immigrant
locational choice generally (e.g., Card, 2001; Borjas, 1999 and 2006), there is less research on
the impact of these state and federal policies on illegal immigration. Much of the existing
research has focused on the labor market impact of policies such as the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act (IRCA) (Bansak and Raphael, 2001; Lowell, Teachman, and Jing,
1995), the enforcement measures put into place after 9/11 (Orrenius and Zavodny, 2009), or
Immigration and Naturalization Service monitoring strategies (Davila and Pagan, 1997). In
addition, among the papers that directly examine the effect of policies on illegal immigration
flows, most have largely focused on the impact of either border security or demand-side
penalties such as employer sanctions. For example, Hanson and Spilimbergo (1999) exploit
time-series variation in border enforcement due to electoral cycles and changes in federal
national defense spending to identify the impact of enforcement on border apprehensions.

1

Orrenius and Zavodny (2009) examine whether the amnesty aspect of IRCA affected the longterm flow of undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and find no evidence that it did. Bohn,
Lofstrom, and Raphael (2014) use synthetic control methods and Census data to examine the
effect of a 2007 Arizona law mandating employers use E-Verify on the presence of foreign-born
Hispanics, and find that it lead to the exit of Hispanics. Amuedo-Dorantes and Lozano (2015)
and Sanchez (2015) use similar synthetic control methods to examine the impact of the antiimmigration law Arizona SB 1070 on the stock of non-citizen Hispanics in Arizona. AmuedoDorantes and Lozano (2015) find that the law had minimal effect, while Sanchez (2015) reports
that the law resulted in a temporary one-year reduction of 10 to 16 percent in the proportion of
noncitizen Hispanics. Finally, Watson (2013) examines how state and local enforcement of
federal immigration law affects immigrants’ locational decisions.
This paper complements this existing research by examining the impact of Arizona SB
1070 on the flows of illegal immigrants to and from Arizona from Mexico. We focus on Arizona
SB 1070 because it is arguably the most restrictive and controversial immigration bill ever
passed by a state, though the legal battles regarding its enactment have made it particularly
difficult to study. The law, which was passed in April of 2010 and scheduled to take effect on
July 29, targeted labor supply by making applying for or holding a job in Arizona a crime. It
also required police officers to check the immigration status of anyone they believe may be in the
country illegally, and allowed them to stop and arrest anyone they have reason to believe lack
proper immigration papers. The law also allowed police to arrest an individual they believe to
have committed a crime that would cause him or her to be deported.

In short, the law

substantially increased the expected costs of being an unauthorized immigrant in Arizona.

2

One unique feature of the law critical to its evaluation is that it never went into full effect.
On July 28, one day before the law was scheduled to go into effect, a federal judge issued a
temporary injunction blocking much of the law pending the outcome of a legal challenge by the
federal government. Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down several components
of the law. As a result, the primary way in which one can evaluate the impact of the law is to
study the effect of the law’s announcement from April through July. This complicates the
evaluation for several reasons. The first is that because the announcement period lasts fewer
than 4 months, it is difficult to estimate its impact using annual data coming from the American
Community Survey (ACS) or the detailed March Supplement of the Current Population Survey
(CPS). The second is that while the CPS has less detailed data available at the monthly level
measuring the stock of foreign-born non-citizen Hispanics already in Arizona, one might well
expect this settled population to wait for the enactment of the law before moving, rather than
responding to the announcement. Finally, it may be difficult to detect a small change in the
stock of Hispanics in Arizona due to a reduction in immigration into Arizona by new
immigrants, who are likely more sensitive to the announcement of the new law.
We overcome these issues by exploiting a unique data set from Mexico in which
undocumented workers were surveyed in Mexican border towns and Mexican airports on their
way to or from the United States. These data have three major advantages. First, they are
available at the monthly level, which is critical given the short time frame between passage and
the temporary injunction. Second, these data focus on a population that is considerably more
likely to be responsive to the announcement of a new law, since they have not yet settled into a
location. Third, since the survey is given in Mexico and not in the U.S., there is much less
concern about asking and having respondents honestly answer whether they have papers,

3

enabling us to study the precise population targeted by the legislation. In fact, more than 94
percent of those surveyed who intend to cross into the U.S. in the next 30 days report that they
do not have legal permission to work in the United States. As a result, we can directly identify
the population being targeted by SB 1070, which is not possible using other data sources.1
Results indicate that the passage and announcement of the law significantly deterred
undocumented immigrants from settling in Arizona. Event study and difference-in-differences
estimates indicate that the law reduced illegal immigration into Arizona from Mexico by a
statistically significant 30 to 70 percent.

Unsurprisingly, this effect was reduced by

approximately half when the judge issued the preliminary injunction blocking much of the bill,
which likely reflects the reduced certainty that the law would end up going into effect.
On the other hand, we find little evidence that the passage of the law induced
undocumented immigrants already residing in Arizona to return to Mexico.
Collectively, these results suggest that the locational decisions of unauthorized
immigrants entering the U.S. are responsive to state legal climates, at least in the case of the
restrictive and well-publicized Arizona SB 1070.

2. Background of Arizona SB 1070
In the mid to late 2000s, the Arizona border was by far the most commonly crossed
border with Mexico. For example, in 2009 the U.S. Border Patrol reported that 46 percent of
apprehensions made along the border with Mexico were made in Arizona. Similarly, in our data

1

For example, Passel and Cohn (2010) estimate that of foreign-born non-citizen Hispanics residing in the U.S.—a
group often studied as a proxy for unauthorized immigrants in Census data—more than half are actually authorized
to be in the U.S. Similarly, our own estimates using the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) indicate
that even among the population of non-citizen, foreign-born Hispanics with less than 12 years of education, fewer
than 60 percent are unauthorized.
4

76 percent of undocumented immigrants crossing into the United States say they plan to do so in
Arizona.
As a result of this traffic, Arizona has had a longer history than most states in passing
legislation in an attempt to deter illegal immigration. In 1996, the legislature passed a law that
required proof of legal status in order to obtain a driver’s license. In 2000, voters banned
bilingual education by a vote of 63 to 37, effectively requiring all courses to be taught in English.
In 2004, voters passed Proposition 200, which denied public benefits to those not in the country
legally. Three years later, Arizona passed the Legal Arizona Workers Act, which required the
use of the E-Verify system by all Arizona employers to assess the legal eligibility of all new
hires, and imposes penalties on employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers.
In 2010, Arizona passed SB 1070, which was signed by the governor on April 23, 2010,
after having passed both houses in the legislature earlier that month. As passed, SB 1070
contained several different provisions. One of the provisions, referred to by critics as “show
your papers,” required police to check the immigration status of any individual they arrested or
detained. It also allowed police to stop and arrest anyone they had reason to believe was an
undocumented immigrant. Other provisions made it a crime to be in Arizona as well as to apply
for or hold a job in Arizona if one did not have valid immigration papers. Finally, another
provision allowed police to arrest anyone suspected of having committed a crime that would
cause him to be deported.
Importantly, the passage of the law received significant media attention in both the U.S.
and Mexico. For example, after the governor signed the bill, the Office of the President of
Mexico issued a statement condemning the law, as did the Organization of American States,
which said the law creates a basis for racial discrimination (Reséndiz, 2010; OEA Cuestiona Ley

5

Antiinmigrante, 2010). Marcelo Ebrard, the mayor of Mexico City, also issued a statement
condemning the law, saying it violated “all conventions” on human rights, and thousands of
Latinos demonstrated outside the parliament building in Phoenix (Ebrard Condena Ley Arizona,
2010). Governors and legislatures of Mexican states also denounced the law (Martínez, 2010;
Sonora Protesta Contra Ley Antiinmigrante, 2010; and Ley Arizona Afectaría Michoacanos,
2010). Word of the law even made its way to Major League Baseball – protestors greeted the
Arizona Diamondbacks in Chicago and Denver, and a US Senator urged players to boycott the
2011 All-Star game, which was to take place in Phoenix (McGrath, 2010; Herszenhorn, 2010).
Thus, given the high profile and controversial nature of the law, we believe it is likely that those
immigrating illegally to the US over this time would be aware of it.
The law was scheduled to go into effect on July 29, 2010. However, on July 28, U.S.
District Judge Susan Bolton blocked much of the bill, pending the outcome of a challenge to the
law filed by the federal government. On June 25, 2012 the Supreme Court struck down much of
the law, upholding only a provision that allows police to check immigration status under some
circumstances.

3. Data
The data used in this project come from the Survey of Migration to the Northern Border
(EMIF). The EMIF is a cross-sectional survey conducted by Mexican authorities with the
objective of measuring a representative sample of the migrant flow across the U.S.-Mexico
border. It is conducted in 8 border cities and 5 Mexican airports, which enables it to account for
approximately 94 percent of the migrant flow between Mexico and the United States (Consejo
Nacional de Población, 2013). Within localities, the survey is conducted at different zones (bus

6

stations, train stations, international bridges, and customs inspection points) and at different
points (access doors, boarding zones, gates, and baggage claim areas) that migrants must pass.
The survey consists of four separate questionnaires, each of which is targeted at a
different group of immigrants. We focus on two of those questionaires.2 The first is a survey of
individuals who are in Mexican border cities, but are not residents of those cities. Specifically,
we focus on those born in Mexico who were at least 15 years old and who reported an intention
to cross the border in the next 30 days to work in the U.S., but do not have documentation to
work there legally.3 The second is conducted in border cities and Mexican airports and surveys
migrants returning from the United States to Mexico. Again, we focus primarily on adults who
had been working in the U.S. without legal authorization.
These data offer several advantages in evaluating the impact of SB 1070 on immigration
into Arizona. A primary advantage is that the data are monthly level observations on the
locational decisions of immigrants who are likely to be sensitive to the announcement of a law.
This is important because while one would reasonably expect the decisions of those leaving
Mexico for the U.S. to be affected by the announcement of the new law, one might also
reasonably expect Hispanics already there to wait until the law went into effect before uprooting
and moving elsewhere. Thus, given the complicated legal challenges that followed and the
uncertainty of whether the law would ever go into effect, it is not clear when exactly one would
expect current Hispanic residents to be impacted. In addition, monthly data on entry into
Arizona from Mexico enable us to observe changes in flows directly, even if those monthly
flows are small relative to the total stock of foreign-born non-citizen Hispanics in Arizona. This
2

One unused survey is conducted among migrants apprehended by the U.S. border authorities and returned to
Mexico. The other is conducted among individuals in border cities returning to different Mexican states, but who
had not previously been in the U.S.

Of those who report they intend to cross the border to work in the U.S., 94 percent report that they do not have
documentation to do so legally. In addition, 99 percent report that they intend to cross within the next 30 days.

is a critical advantage of the EMIF data compared to the Current Population Survey (CPS) and
American Community Survey (ACS). Those data allow for either a monthly measure of the
population stock of Hispanics in Arizona, who likely are not sensitive to the announcement of
SB 1070, or an annual measure of the number of Hispanics who have immigrated from Mexico
in the previous year.
A second advantage is that we observe directly whether the individuals in our data have
papers to work in the United States. Importantly, not only is this question asked, but since the
survey is administered in Mexico, there is likely less fear of answering these questions truthfully.
This is reflected in the fact that 94 percent of the immigrants surveyed who will cross to the U.S.
report that they do not have papers. In contrast, using the CPS or ACS data limits one to
examining the impact on a subset of Hispanics, such as foreign-born non-citizens, that serves as
a proxy for undocumented immigrants. This can be somewhat problematic; Passel and Cohn
(2010) estimate that fewer than half of all foreign-born, non-citizen Hispanics residing in the
U.S. are unauthorized, and our own calculations using the National Agricultural Workers Survey
suggests that fewer than 60 percent of foreign-born, non-citizen Hispanics with fewer than 12
years education are unauthorized.4 In addition, one might worry that unauthorized immigrants
may be less likely to respond to a U.S. government survey after a restrictive law such as SB 1070
is passed. One might also worry that to the extent documented and undocumented immigrants
are substitutes, it may be difficult to observe a decline in undocumented immigrants using CPS
or ACS data.
Finally, in contrast to data on border patrol apprehensions, these data provide a measure
of flows that is independent of enforcement measures, which could change in response to a law
like SB 1070. And perhaps more importantly, the EMIF data have information on the ultimate

destination of immigrants once they enter the United States, in addition to where they plan on
crossing.

This is a critical distinction, as our data show that while 76 percent of illegal

immigrants cross the border in Arizona, the majority of them were headed to other states. Thus,
while Border Patrol apprehension data are likely useful in assessing the impact of national
policies (e.g., Hanson and Spilimbergo, 1999), they are of limited use in studying the impact of
state policies.5
For the main analysis, we limit our sample to undocumented immigrants who are entering
the United States, though we also examine undocumented migrants returning permanently to
Mexico from the U.S. We focus on the time period from January of 2009 through December of
2010. Over this time period, we have observations on a total of 16,251 unauthorized immigrants
heading to the U.S., and 4,005 immigrants returning to Mexico from the U.S.
Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. Ninety percent of those who intend to cross the
border are male. Average age is 30 years old, while average years of schooling is 7.3. Nine
percent of those entering the U.S. speak English, and 10 percent have previously worked in the
U.S. California is the most popular destination at 26 percent, while 13 percent of immigrants
report they are headed to Arizona. Twenty-nine percent report that they do not know the state of
destination; consequently, we perform tests to ensure that any reduction in the likelihood of
immigrating to Arizona does not merely reflect a shift into this category and find no evidence
that this was the case.
Of those returning to Mexico permanently, average age and education are somewhat
higher (33 years old and 8.2 years of education.) In addition, because the airport survey is larger

5

We also note that we were unable to acquire monthly border apprehension data by location. We were told that
while these data had been available in the past, they were no longer being released due to concern that the
information would be used by those illegally crossing the border.
9

than the land survey for return migrants, 71 percent are surveyed in an airport.6 Ninety percent
of them worked in the U.S., and the average time spent there was 37.1 months. Twenty-three
percent of returning undocumented immigrants report spending the most time in California,
compared to 4 percent for Arizona.
A limitation of these data is that we know only that respondents intend to cross the border
in the next 30 days and reside in a given state, not whether they ultimately do so. For example,
some may not do so because they are apprehended at the border. However, using estimates on
the probability of apprehension by the Border Patrol along with the probability of attempting to
re-enter the U.S., we calculate a probability of successfully entering the U.S. of more than 90
percent.

Still, we unfortunately have no way to verify that the immigrants surveyed do

ultimately reside in the intended state.7 Thus, while an advantage of the EMIF data is that we
know whether or not the immigrants are unauthorized and can directly detect changes in the
monthly flow of immigrants into Arizona from Mexico, a disadvantage is we must rely on survey
responses with respect to intended destination.

4. Methodology
To identify effects of SB 1070 on immigration flows into Arizona from Mexico, we ask
whether undocumented immigrants headed for the United States were any less likely to go to
Arizona once the law was passed and set to go into effect. Specifically, we ask whether

6

We note, however, that results for return immigrants are similar regardless of whether use both the land and airport
surveys or focus only on one or the other.
7
Table A1 in Appendix A shows a comparison between recent immigrant location shares from the ACS and the
EMIF. Across all 50 states, the correlation between the two measures is 0.78 and 0.77 for 2009 and 2010,
respectively. Immigrants who intend to reside in California are more likely to appear relative to the proportion
surveyed in California by the ACS, while the opposite is true for Texas. It is difficult to know the source of the
discrepancies. One possibility is that one or both of the surveys are not representative as intended, while another is
that the discrepancies are driven by the roughly 40 percent of the respondents in the ACS who are authorized
immigrants, whereas all those we use in the EMIF data are unauthorized.
10

immigrants were less likely to report that their ultimate destination across the border was
Arizona during the time period of April through July of 2010, when the law was passed and set
to go into effect, but before the federal judged issued a temporary block of much of the law.
We do this in two ways. First, we perform an event study using individual-level data to
examine whether the proportion of unauthorized immigrants destined for Arizona fell between
April and July of 2009, when the law had been passed but not yet enacted or blocked.8
Formally, we estimate the following using ordinary least squares:

(1)

Destination _ AZ it   0  1Post _ Passageit   2 Post _ Injunctionit  X it   it

where Destination_AZ is an indicator equal to one for individual i at time period t if the
individual plans to reside in Arizona, Post_Passage is an indicator equal to 1 after the law was
passed but before the federal injunction was issued (April through July of 2010), and
Post_Injunction is an indicator equal to one after the federal injunction was issued. The vector X
contains a set of time-varying controls that one might expect would affect immigration decisions,
including the unemployment and per capita person income for the U.S. and the states of Arizona,
California, Florida, and Texas.
The identifying assumption is that in absence of the passage of SB 1070, the rate at which
entering undocumented immigrants went to Arizona would have remained the same as it was
prior to the passage of the law in April of 2010. We address the validity of this assumption in
8

An alternative methodology would be to use a synthetic control approach as proposed by Abadie, Diamond, and
Hainmueller (2010) and implemented by Bohn, Lofstrom, and Raphael (2014) in examining the impact of the Legal
Arizona Workers Act passed in Arizona in 2007. We do not implement this approach because it relies heavily on
using a long time-series of data before the treatment to construct a synthetic counterfactual that closely tracks the
treated state. This is difficult because Arizona passed several laws prior to 2010 that would likely impact flows of
undocumented workers into Arizona. For example, Bohn, Lofstrom, and Raphael (2014) document the significant
impact that the Legal Arizona Workers Act of 2007 had on the presence of various subgroups of Hispanics.
11

several ways. First, we show that the rate at which undocumented immigrants went to Arizona
was remarkably stable over the 15 months prior to the passage of the law, suggesting that time
effects over this period seem relatively minor.

Second, we show that the estimates are

unaffected by the inclusion of controls measuring the unemployment and per capita income in
Arizona and other states, which means there is little evidence that the decline in immigration to
Arizona is driven by Arizona-specific time shocks. Third, we show that allowing for more
general linear and quadratic time trends does not affect our estimates.
The second approach we use is a difference-in-differences research design, which
requires a somewhat different assumption. Specifically, we assume that the relative change in
the number of immigrants destined for Arizona would have been similar to the relative change in
the number of immigrants destined for elsewhere. To implement this approach, we collapse the
individual-level data into group-by-month cells, where one cell per month measures the number
of immigrants destined for Arizona, and the other measures the number of immigrants destined
elsewhere. Formally, we estimate the following:

(2)

ln(immigrants )it  t  1 Destination _ AZ   2 (( Destination _ AZ ) * ( Post _ Passage )) it
  3 (( Destination _ AZ ) * ( Post _ Injunction ))it   it

where i denotes whether the observation measures the number of immigrants headed to Arizona,
or elsewhere, and t denotes year-by-month. Destination_AZ is an indicator equal to one if the
observation is for immigrants headed to Arizona, and zero otherwise, and  is a set of year-bymonth fixed effects. The coefficients of interest are θ2 and θ3, which measure the reduction in the
number of immigrants headed to Arizona after the law was passed, relative to the change in the
number of immigrants headed elsewhere.
12

The primary drawback to this approach is to the extent that the Arizona law induced
immigrants to go elsewhere in the U.S., as opposed to stay in Mexico, the difference-indifferences estimate can be overstated. To address that, we define the control group in three
ways: all other immigrants, all immigrants with known destinations other than Arizona, and all
immigrants destined for Texas or Florida. Thus, for this last sample, we assume that those
headed to Arizona would not be displaced to either Texas or Florida, and thus changes in the
number of immigrants headed to Texas or Florida provides a reasonable counterfactual for how
immigration into Arizona would have changed in the absence of SB 1070.
In addition to asking whether the law impacts immigration into Arizona, we also ask
whether the law affects return migration decisions. That is, we ask whether SB 1070 induced
undocumented immigrants to return to Mexico from Arizona. To do so, we estimate a modified
version of equation (1) in which we instead use a dependent variable equal to one if the
individual returned to Mexico from Arizona.
It is important to acknowledge the limitation of the approaches outlined above. While
our data and approaches are well-suited for examining whether a state law deterred
undocumented immigrants from entering that state, it is much more difficult to know whether
those individuals stayed in Mexico, or if they went to another state. Thus, while we can assess
the deterrent effect of state policy for that state, we cannot easily answer whether that law has
spillover effects on other states, or what the implication of these laws would be if passed by all
states.

13

5. Results
We begin by examining the graphical evidence of immigrant flows into the U.S. from
Mexico.

Figure 1a shows the number of survey respondents immigrating to the U.S., by

destination. It shows that there was a steep decline in the number of undocumented immigrants
headed for Arizona beginning in April of 2010, the month the bill was passed, continuing
through July of 2010, the last month before the federal injunction was issued.
Figure 1b shows the proportion of immigrants destined for Arizona, and shows that a
similar pattern holds in relative terms. While the proportion of undocumented immigrants going
to Arizona had previously fluctuated between 15 and 20 percent, it steadily declined from April
through July of 2010, reaching a low of just below 5 percent. After the federal injunction was
issued at the end of July, signaling uncertainty that many of the provisions in the law would ever
go into effect, the proportion of immigrants headed to Arizona increased to around 12 percent.
In short, the raw data suggest that undocumented immigrants were deterred from going to
Arizona by the announcement of the law, though that effect was diminished by approximately
one-half by the federal injunction blocking much of the law.
Corresponding estimates are shown in Table 2.

Estimates in column 1 include no

controls, while our preferred specification in column 2 includes the unemployment rate and per
capita personal income for the U.S. overall as well as for Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas.
Column 3 additionally tests for whether there is any evidence of a drop-off in the likelihood of
going to Arizona before the law was passed. Column 4 includes both time-varying controls as
well as a linear time trend, and column 5 includes time-varying controls and a quadratic time
trend.

14

As shown in column 1, the unconditional estimate of the impact of the law on the
likelihood of immigrating to Arizona is a reduction of 7.3 percentage points, which represents a
44 percent relative decline and is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The estimate is
remarkably stable: adding time-varying controls for economic conditions as well as general
linear and quadratic time trends have only slight impacts on the estimate. Estimates in columns
2 through 5 range from 4.9 to 6.3 percentage points, and all are significant at the 1 percent level.
This confirms the visual evidence in Figures 1 and 2: the announcement of SB 1070 is associated
with a statistically significant and economically meaningful reduction in illegal immigration into
Arizona.
Table 2 also shows estimates of the impact of the law announcement after the federal
judge issued an injunction at the end of July. Consistent with Figure 1, estimates are about half
the size of those of the pure announcement effect.
Importantly, there is little evidence that the significant reduction in the proportion of
immigrants saying they intend to reside in Arizona is due to a shift toward not reporting where
they intend to reside.9 In unreported results from a specification similar to column 2 of Table 2,
we find that the announcement and post-injunction periods are associated with changes in the
likelihood of not reporting where one intends to reside of 2.3 and -2.1 percentage points,
respectively, neither of which is statistically significant.
In addition, we also examine the behavior of first-time migrants and migrants with
previous migration experience separately. To the extent that SB 1070 is responsible for the
reduction in overall immigration into Arizona shown in Figure 1, we would expect to see a larger
reduction among new migrants who have not yet established social and work networks. Figure 2

9

One could be worried, for example, that immigrants no longer say they intend to reside in Arizona and instead
report that they do not know, but they end up residing in Arizona anyway.
15

shows this is indeed the case: Figure 2a shows a large reduction in the likelihood of unauthorized
new migrants going to Arizona, while Figure 2b shows little evidence that the locational
decisions of experienced migrants were affected. This pattern of results also provides additional
evidence that it would be difficult to detect an impact of the announcement of SB 1070 using
Census data on the stock of Hispanics already in Arizona; if the locational decisions of
experienced migrants are unaffected, it seems likely that the decisions of those already in
Arizona would also be unaffected.10
Next, we examine the difference-in-differences estimates, which are shown in Table 3.
Column 1 includes the entire sample of undocumented workers, while column 2 uses only those
with known destinations, and column 3 uses only those who were destined for Arizona, Texas, or
Florida.

Estimates for columns 1 through 3 are -0.77, -0.74, and -0.72, all of which are

statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The robustness of the estimates is striking given
how significantly the identifying assumption changes across the three specifications.

For

example, the estimate of -0.72 in column 5 represents the causal impact of SB 1070 under the
assumption that i) SB 1070 did not displace any immigrants to Texas or Florida, and ii) changes
in unauthorized immigration to Texas and Florida form a proper counterfactual for what would
have happened in Arizona absent the law.11 Under those assumptions, estimates in column 5
indicate that the passage of SB 1070 significantly reduced illegal immigration by 72 percent,
though again this deterrent effect was diminished by about half after the federal injunction was
issued.

10

An open question remains whether the locational decisions of return migrants and migrants already residing in
Arizona would have been affected if SB 1070 had been fully implemented.
11
We expect that to the extent there was displacement, it would have been most likely to happen in California and
New Mexico, which border Arizona, though we unfortunately do not have a way to test this empirically.
16

Given these findings, it is worth thinking about what would have to be true for some
other factor to be driving the decline in immigration into Arizona from Mexico over this time
period. One would have to believe that, coincidental with the passage of the law, some other
factor (say, labor demand) made entry into Arizona less attractive. That factor would have to
change starting in April of 2010, coincidental with the passage of SB 1070, but not in the months
prior. It must also have reversed somewhat in August, coincidental with the federal judge
blocking much of the law from going into effect. In addition, this factor would have to be
uncorrelated with the state per capita income and unemployment rates in high-immigration
states. It would also have to reduce immigration into Arizona, but not other states such as Texas,
California, or Florida. And finally, this factor would have to reduce immigration by new
migrants, but not by migrants with previous migration experience. We are unable to think of
such a confounding variable. As a result, we feel confident that the observed decline in illegal
immigration into Arizona, as shown in the figures and tables, is due to Arizona’s passage of
perhaps the toughest anti-immigration bill ever passed by a state, and not some other factor.
Finally, as discussed earlier, while it is difficult for us to assess whether the reduction in
illegal immigration flows into Arizona represents an overall reduction in illegal immigration to
the U.S. or a shifting of unauthorized immigrants to other states, we can directly examine
whether the law induced undocumented workers to leave Arizona for Mexico. The number and
proportion of undocumented immigrants returning permanently from Arizona to Mexico are
shown in Figure 3. Based on those figures, there is little evidence to suggest that SB 1070
induced workers to leave Arizona for Mexico. This lack of evidence is also evident in the
corresponding regression estimates, shown in Table 4. All estimates are small, and only 1 of 10

17

estimates is statistically significant at the 10 percent level. None are significant at the 5 percent
level.
In summary, we find that the passage and announcement of SB 1070 significantly
reduced immigration into Arizona by 30 to 70 percent. In contrast, we find no evidence that the
law induced unauthorized immigrants already in Arizona to return to Mexico.

6. Conclusion
This paper examines whether the passage of Arizona SB 1070, arguably the most
restrictive and controversial anti-illegal immigration legislation ever passed by a state, deterred
entry of undocumented workers into Arizona. More broadly, it asks whether state policies that
increase the expected costs associated with unauthorized immigration can serve as effective
deterrents.
Results indicate that the passage of Arizona SB 1070 significantly reduced the flow of
undocumented workers into Arizona from Mexico by 30 to 70 percent. This deterrent effect was
diminished when a federal judge issued an injunction blocking much of the bill from going into
effect. However, we find no evidence that the bill induced undocumented workers currently
living in Arizona to return to Mexico.
Collectively, these results suggest that the decision to immigrate without authorization is
sensitive to expected benefits and costs, even to the point that a law that has only been
announced, but not enacted, impacts the immigration and locational decisions of new immigrants
from Mexico. While this does not mean that laws like Arizona SB 1070 are socially desirable—
much less constitutional—it does suggest that laws like this will continue to have appeal among
states attempting to reduce the inflow of unauthorized immigrants.
