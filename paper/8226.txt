Should Monetary Policy Respond Strongly to Output Gaps?
Bennett T. McCallum
Recent years have seen a marked convergence, among academic
and central bank researchers, on a general framework for conducting
analysis of monetary policy.

There is more of a convergence in

terms of method, however, than specific models, for crucial features of the framework are flexible enough to accommodate quite
divergent views regarding the workings of the economy.

In this

paper, I will review the framework, describe some leading disputes
concerning model specification, and discuss one particular policy
issue—mentioned in the title—that is of great practical importance.
1. Agreement on Framework
The method or approach on which there is substantial agreement
can be described as follows: the researcher specifies a quantitative macro model that is intended to be structural (invariant to
policy changes) and consistent with both theory and data.

Then, by

stochastic simulation or analytical means, he determines how crucial variables (such as inflation and the output gap) behave on
average under various alternative policy rules.
expectations (RE) is assumed in both stages.

Usually, rational

Evaluation of the

different outcomes can be accomplished by means of an optimal control exercise, or by reference to an explicit loss function, or
left to the judgement (i.e., loss function) of the implied policymaker.

To an extent, this approach has been used for decades, but

the tendency to be more explicit, to show respect for both theory
and evidence, to utilize RE, and to stress performance under alternative maintained rules is much stronger than in the past.





There is also considerable agreement about the general, broad
structure of the macroeconomic model to be used.1

It can be out-

lined in terms of a simplified three-sector representation in which
Rt is a one-period interest rate while pt and yt are logs of the
price level and output, with  t the natural-rate value of yt:
(1)

yt = bo + b1(Rt−Et∆pt+1) + Etyt+1 + vt

(2)

∆pt = βEt∆pt+1 + α(yt−  t) + ut

(3)

Rt = (1−µ3)[r + ∆pt + µ1(∆pt−π*) + µ2(yt−  t)] + µ3Rt-1 + et.

Here (1) represents an optimizing IS-type relation or set of relations, (2) a price adjustment relation or set of relations, and (3)
a monetary policy rule for period-by-period (quarters) setting of
the policy instrument Rt.

Also, Etzt+j is the expectation of zt+j con-

ditional on information available in t, while vt, ut, and et are exogenous shocks, vt reflecting tastes and fiscal policy.

If capital

and therefore  t are treated as exogenous, as in the simplest versions, then (1)-(3) determine time paths for yt, ∆pt, and Rt.2 If
investment is treated endogenously, then capital and  t are endogenous and additional relations must be included in the sector here
represented by (1).

With no money stock terms in (1), there is no

need to include a money demand equation even though one may be implied by the optimizing analysis.
It should be noted briefly that the private behavior portions
of the model are often justified by full-blown dynamic optimizing

analysis in a general equilibrium setting.

Thus it would be incor-

rect to suggest, as in Neil Wallace (2000, p. 933), that the body
of research under discussion "build[s] models one equation at a
time and justif[ies] each equation with a separate story."

That

all of the private sector relations can be obtained from one unified analysis is demonstrated in several papers going back to Robert King and Alexander Wolman (1996) and Tack Yun (1996).
The policy rule may or may not reflect optimizing behavior by
the central bank (CB), depending on the purpose of the analysis. If
the object is to find the optimal policy for the particular model
under consideration, then (3) will be replaced by the implied rule
for Rt that results from optimization with respect to the CB’s objective function—which itself may or may not be explicitly based on
the utility function of private agents.

But it is not true that

all worthwhile analysis presumes optimization by the CB; positive
analysis of the effects of different hypothetical rules represents
an alternative approach that some analysts find more useful.3
2. Disagreement on Specifics
Let us now consider some of the leading issues concerning behavior represented by (1), (2), and (3).

In doing so it will be

helpful to have a particular quantitative example at hand so that
the effects of different specifications can be illustrated.

Sup-

pose then that the model’s parameters are b1 =−0.4, β=0.99, α=0.03,
µ1=0.5, µ2=0.5, µ3=0.8. (The latter reflects a realistic degree of
interest rate smoothing.)

Also, vt, ut, et, and  t are AR(1) proc-



esses with AR parameters 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, and 0.95, respectively, and
innovation standard deviations of 0.03, 0.002, 0.0017, and 0.007.
Then we can examine the model’s impulse response functions to learn
about its properties.

These are shown for unit realizations of et,

vt, ut, and ηt (innovation in  t) as the dashed curves in Figure 1.
With regard to the "IS" relation (1), note that only one of
the impulse response functions (IRFs) shows much inertia in the
series for yt.

In this model, as a consequence, neither yt nor the

output gap,  t = yt-  t, features persistence in the implied autocovariance functions.

Since high persistence is present in the

data, this reflects a weakness of the model, as emphasized by
Fuhrer (2000) and others.4

That weakness can be remedied to a con-

siderable extent, while still representing optimizing behavior, by
adoption of a household utility function in which current-period
utility depends upon Ct/Ct-1h, rather than just Ct, where the latter
is per-capita consumption.

With Fuhrer’s estimated value of h=0.8,

much more persistence is generated (as will be shown below).
Another IS-related dispute concerns the value of b1 (or its
counterpart if we take h>0).

Thus Julio Rotemberg and Michael

Woodford (1999) use –6 whereas McCallum and Edward Nelson (1999)
suggest −0.2.

My present belief is that −0.4 is more appropriate

than either; this supposes that −0.2 is about right for consumption
alone but needs to be increased to reflect the investment spending

that is not explicit in the simplified structure (1)-(3).
More controversial still is the price adjustment specification.

With the basic relation (2) and a white noise ut, the IRFs

for ∆pt show very little inertia, as shown by the dashed curves in
Figure 1.5

Again the absence of persistence follows, and again it

is counterfactual.
persistence.
(2’)

There are two common routes for introducing

One is to respecify the price adjustment equation as

∆pt = (1−φ)Et∆pt+1 + φ∆pt-1 + α(yt−  t) + ut.

Here the value φ=0.5 is suggested by the approach of Fuhrer and
Moore (1995), but some argue for a higher value of φ.

With φ=0.5,

and also using the h=0.8 case with habit formation in consumption,
the results are as shown by the solid curves in Figure 1.

These

seem much more consistent with empirical reality. As yet, however,
no one has produced a convincing optimizing rationale for (2’).
It has been suggested that one could retain (2) but specify
that ut is serially correlated, e.g., ut=ρut-1+εt (with εt white noise)
with ρ=0.8.

That change could result in realistic persistence in

inflation, but would not affect the first three IRFs in Figure 1.
Also, it is again the case that the theoretical rationale is quite
weak.

Indeed, it is not clear just what phenomena ut is supposed to

represent, even when assumed to be white noise.
McCallum and Nelson (1999) implicitly object to both (2) and
(2’) on the grounds that neither satisfies the strict version of
the natural rate hypothesis.

They propose instead the P-bar model,

which does satisfy the NRH and implies much persistence for yt and
 .
t

It does not generate adequate inflation persistence, however,

and leads to a few counter-intuitive responses to certain shocks.
A leading dispute concerning policy is whether it is desirable
for the CB to respond strongly to the output gap,  t.

To set the

stage, adopt (2') and h=0.8 and consider the standard deviations
(SDs) of ∆pt,  t, and Rt in Table 1. Since constant terms are ignored in the simulations, these SDs reflect root-mean-square targeting misses for ∆pt and yt.

In Table 1, it is assumed that the CB

responds to the variables Et-1∆pt+1−π* and  t.

As the response to  t

is strengthened (µ2 is increased), the variability of  t is reduced,
as can be seen readily from each row.

The variability of ∆pt−π* is,

however, increased for large values of µ2.

In this sense there is a

tradeoff between inflation and output-gap variability.

Interest-

ingly, such a tradeoff does not exist if there is no shock term ut
in equation (2').

If Table 1 were redone with σu=0, the entries for

µ1=0.5 and µ2=50 would be 0.47, 0.83, and 11.23.

So one issue need-

ing resolution is the existence and nature of the ut shock term.
3. Policy Rule Operationality
We now turn to the dispute concerning the role of the output
gap in the CB’s policy rule.
of data.

One point concerns the availability

Whereas many analysts proceed under the presumption that

the CB can observe and respond to ∆pt and  t when setting Rt, McCallum and Nelson (1999) and Athanasios Orphanides (2000) have disagreed strongly.


An obvious first step in the direction of realism


is to replace  t in (3) with Et-1  t.

To see whether this replacement

has much effect on the CB’s ability to conduct a successful stabilization policy, consider next the SDs reported in Table 2.

Here

we see that for large values of µ2 the effectiveness of the rule, in
terms of the SD of  t, is reduced.

The reduction is not large,

however, and for small values of µ2 there is almost none.
A second point of concern is, therefore, of greater practical
importance.

It involves the unobservability of the natural-rate

level of output that goes into the CB’s measure of the output gap.
In this case the nature of the problem is quite different.

Rather

than reflecting merely a lack of current information, the problem
in this case is largely conceptual—that is, stems from the existence of various different concepts of the relevant reference value
(which we have been calling "natural-rate").

That there are sev-

eral distinct concepts in use is implicit in the terms used by different researchers and practitioners.

In addition to "natural

rate," other terms involve the words "potential," "trend," "capacity," "NAIRU," "market-clearing," and "flexible-price."

There are

perhaps fewer distinct concepts than terms, but there are at least
three fundamentally different ones: trend, NAIRU, and flexibleprice.

And of course there are many ways of measuring trend output

that are quite different in their effects.

Crucially, since reli-

ance on any particular concept will persist over time, differences
will not have the orthogonality properties of pure "noise."
Which of the concepts is most appropriate theoretically?
From the perspective of dynamic, optimizing analysis, the answer is




the flexible-price concept—i.e., the output level that would prevail in the absence of nominal price stickiness.

There have been

very few attempts to implement this approach empirically, but there
is a brief one in McCallum and Nelson (M-N) (1999). It begins with
the assumption that output is produced according to a production
function linearly relating yt to the logs of labor and capital (nt
and kt), a deterministic trend, and a shock term at reflecting the
stochastic component of technological change.

Then, since kt and at

are given in t whether or not prices are flexible, the difference
yt−  t (i.e., the output gap) will be proportional to the difference
between actual and flexible-price labor input, nt−
ity M-N assumed that

t

.

t

For simplic-

(per period, per person) is a constant.

Numerically, M-N measured nt for the United States, 1955.1-1996.4,
as total manhours employed in non-agricultural private industry
divided by the civilian labor force, and scaled the measure so that
the average value of nt−

t

would equal zero.

The necessity of that

last step is undesirable, but on the positive side there was no
need to remove any trend from the resulting nt−

t

series.

Then us-

ing 0.7 as the elasticity of output with respect to labor, M-N constructed a series for the output gap  t.

This series, with the

corresponding output series, gives a series for  t. It has approximately the time series properties assumed above for that variable.
An important point is that non-zero realizations of the technology shock at affect the M-N measure of  t one-for-one whereas
many detrending procedures remove at almost entirely from each period’s measure of  t.


The same is true, furthermore, for many


NAIRU-based procedures.

So the question now is whether this con-

ceptual discrepancy is of quantitative importance—i.e., whether use
of a mistaken concept would induce a large extent of suboptimality
into policy rules that rely upon measures of the output gap.
To approach this question I now suppose that the M-N measure
of the gap is correct but the CB incorrectly uses the measure based
on linear detrending.

I pretend that the CB has accurate knowledge

of the true trend, which is overly optimistic, so the error as implemented is only that the CB neglects the influence of at on  t.
Results are reported in Table 3.

The SD values shown there

differ from those in Table 2 only because of the postulated mismeasurement of  t.

It is clear that the consequences of the con-

ceptual error are quite substantial for large values of µ2.6 Also,
large values for both µ1 and µ2 entail excessive Rt variability,
which requires either a high target inflation rate or frequent
problems of Rt approaching its zero lower bound.

Thus these results

support the view that it is undesirable to respond strongly to the
output gap.
