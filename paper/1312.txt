Insurance

ABSTRACT

This paper studies the economic role of financial institutions in
economies where agents' incomes are subject to privately observable,

idiosyncratic random events. The information strLlcture precludes conventional

insurance arrangements. However, a financial institution——perhaps best viewed
as a savings bank——can provide partial insurance by generating a time pattern of
deposit returns that redistributes wealth from agents with high incomes to those
with low incomes, resulting in a level of expected utility higher than that
achievable

in simple security markets. Insurance is incomplete because the bank

faces a tradeoff between provision of insurance and maintenance of private
incentives.

Introduction
Economic

analysis

of

institutions,

institutions such as banks,

that

of

financial

is entering an important third stage of

development. Theoretical models of institutional organization are currently

being developed on a wide variety of fronts1 with a common emphasis on the
importance of private information, incentives and contract enforcement. This

third stage of economic analysis holds out the promise of providing
theoretical explanations of the patterns of institutional structure and
behavior catalogued in the initial stage, the detailed classificatory studies

initiated early in the present century.

Further, current theoretical

explanations promise to be more intellectually satisfying and empirically

relevant than earlier second-stage explanations that stressed amorphous
transactions costs.

This paper investigates the nature of financial arrangements in an
environment where individual agents' incomes are subject to idiosyncratic

random shocks.

Risk averse individuals desire insurance against such

disturbances, but conventional insurance arrangements are not feasible because

these income fluctuations

are not publicly observed.

A financial

institution- -perhaps best visualized as a savings bank- -can provide partial

insurance by generating a time pattern of deposit returns that redistributes
income from agents with high incomes to those with low incomes, resulting in a

level of expected utility for depositors that exceeds other market
alternatives. Our development of this banking theory builds on the earlier
analysis of Diamond and Dybvig [1983] and stresses the similarity of expected

utility maximizing banking arrangements to optimal taxation of saving,

for example, Radner [1981] and Fama-Jensen [1982].

analogous

to

discusioxis of income taxation by Mirrlees [1971]. As in the

public finance literature, the bank faces a tradeoff between provision of
insurance and maintenance of private incentives. Consequently, insurance is
typically incomplete.

The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. In section

II, we specify the economic environment and individuals' preferences.

In

section III, we compare three market institutions: full insurance, autarky and

an ex post security market.

The former is not feasible given the

informational requirements of such a system, but serves as a useful "ideal."
An ex post security market dominates autarky, but neither provides insurance

against individual income shocks. In section IV, we discuss the nature of

banking and its provision of partial insurance in our economy, with an
explicit derivation and analysis of the nature of the optimal bank in a
limited (linear) class of candidate institutions.

In section V, we analyze

two topics concerning the relationship between deposit banking and ex
security markets: (I) an equivalence between deposit banking and an ex post

market in derivative claims and (ii) potential arbitrage opportunities
occasioned by simultaneous operation of deposit banking and markets in
underlying securities,

In section VI, we further consider the insurance

aspects of deposit banking in our model and the types of alterations that
would yield more conventional insurance companies. We also provide a summary
of our work and discussion of related ongoing research in section VII.

II. The Model Economy

The hypothetical economy that we study has three periods: a planning
period (t0) and two periods with production and consumption (tl,2), as in
Diamond and Dybvig (1983).

each agent receives a privately observable income level y1(8)

y1 + 0, where

y1 is the level of per capita income at date 1. The idiosyncratic component
of income, 0, has expected value of zero and is continuously distributed on

(0,9) with strictly positive density function f(0).

As our model has a

continuum of traders, who may be indexed at date 1 by the realized value of 0,

each value of the distribution is realized. That is, there are no 'aggregate
shocks' in our model because per capita income is simply y1.

Production Opportunities

In addition to these endowments, agents have intertemporal production
opportunities--storage technologies--of two types.

Consumption Demand and Lifetime jit

In the bulk of our discussion below, we will view our individual agent as

facing sequential market opportunities with (1) the rate of return r0 earned

between t=0 and t1; and (ii) the rate of return r1 earned between t1 and
t=2. Thus, upon realization of 6 at t1, our agent maximizes (1) subject to
the constraint

a(r0,r1,6).

Preferences represented by (1) imply that the consumption demands are
proportional to wealth

where h(r1) =

a(r01r1,0)

r1(l-h(r1)) a(r0,r118).

[l+r1

1.] is the first-period propensity to consume out of

wealth.

In these settings, because our agents face uncertainty about "lifetime
wealth," we can separate the effects of attitudes toward risk aversion from
those concerning the time pattern of consumption. That is, once individuals
enter period 1, they face neither uncertain income nor risky assets. Lifetime

utility, but not the consumption strategy, depends on the risk aversion
To

see this, recall that lifetime utility has the form

u1/(l-fl,

where u(c1,c2) is the CES function specified above. The

parameter .

(4)

v u(c,c) (r1)a(r0,r1,0)

h(r1)1'U0)

is the marginal effect of a change in wealth.

Thus, lifetime realized utility--conditional on a value of 0--is

(5)

G(v) ---

[a(r1)][a(r0,r1,0)],

where (as discussed above)

controls the individuals' aversion to bets on

lifetime wealth. For 3 > 0, individuals are risk averse.

III.

Markets, Insurance and Liquidity
A useful starting point for our analysis is consideration of three

alternative 'trading arrangements' that might arise in our economy.

6

C9je
The case of complete insurance is a useful benchmark case.

In this

benchmarking discussion, we assume that individual incomes/outputs are

publicly observable at zero cost, although this strictly violates the
character of our economic environment as detailed above. Since enforceable

contracts must be contingent on observable variables, public knowledge of
endowments allows standard insurance policies.

As idiosyncratic income (8) has zero mean, each individual should be able

to fully and costlessly insure against 8 at date t0. This insurance is
desirable so long as individuals are risk averse.

With full insurance arranged at date t0, individuals need not engage in
any other market transactions. That is,, they may directly invest in process A

and process B to the points that are efficient given the returns implied by
this technology (r01 and r1R). These investments will yield the consumption
levels shown in Figure 1, where c1 =

h(R)a(l,R,O)

where the post-insurance value of wealth is just

and c2 =
+

y1

+

R[l-h(R)ja(l,R,O),

y2/R

a(i,R,O).2

Aut arky

The polar extreme to the regime of perfect insurance is autarky, in which

an individual agent cannot make any trades.3 In autarky, our model implies

that agents face two types of uncertainty as a result of 8, which are
illustrated in Figure 2a.

For a given value of k, the fraction of wealth

2 In our analysis, here and below, we assume that
is sufficiently large
relative to y1 and y2 so that market equilibrium takes place "off the
corner" at the aggregate level as shown in Figure 1. That is, individuals
will want to save some portion of .
This might be viewed as the outcome of an explicit restriction on trade or
on information that rules out exchange of investments, securities, etc.

The first of these involves parallel shifts in the

budget line (M] A2) induced by variations in 8. The second of these involves
variation in the position of the vertical segment (LL').

With a historically determined value of k, our individual may find that a

particular realization of 0 has confronted him with one of two possible
situations, as illustrated in Figures 2b,c.

In Figure 2b, the agent has a

high draw of 0 and 'regrets' that more was not invested in process B, as he
faces a return of 1 <

R

in his current use of process A. In Figure 2c, the

agent has a low draw of 8 and 'regrets' that so much was invested in process
B, as he would like to 'borrow' at the return of 1 reflected by the short-term
process.

Efficient selection of k involves trading off these costs and

benefits, which we discuss in detail in Appendix A.

We demonstrate two

appealing results, First, in autarky, agents hold more of the liquid asset

for higher returns (R >

Second, agents will always hold some of the

if initial wealth is sufficiently large.

Ex Post Security Market

In autarky, at date 1, there are some individuals who would like to sell

part of their investments in technology B (those that have low values of 0
and, hence, are liquidity constrained) and some who would like to buy Units of

B since these offer a superior return to the alternative of reinvesting in A
(i.e., R >

1).

We now introduce an ex p security market on which such

trades can take place.

this

On

market, c1aiis on type B storage may be bought and sold, so that

the strategy of storing at date 0 and selling off at date 1 generates another
'liquid asset' for the agents in this economy. As a convention, let one share

be a claim to a physical unit stored at date 0 and let P denote its price at
date 1.

At date t1, agents have the following budget constraint,

(6)

c1+Pqk+P(l-k)+y1+8

in which k is the predetermined fraction invested in the short term asset and

in which q is holdings of the long term asset chosen at t1. Thus,
consumption at t=2 is given by c2 =

y2 + Rq. Equivalently, the two period

consumption opportunities are given by

(7)

Py2

c1+c2=k+P(l-k)+y1++8.

Solving for a rational expectations equilibrium involves four stages:

Ci)

finding an agent's optimal consumption profile, subject to the date 1 budget
constraint, at given P; (ii) finding the P that clears the asset market, given

the supply of long term assets, (l-k); (iii) finding an optimal date 0 choice

of k given that agents know the value of P that will prevail; and (iv)
requiring that date 0 market equilibrium occur. A modest amount of intuition,

however, suggests that our economy will have the following solution: P1 and
where k1 is full information portfolio share discussed above.' That is,

with our CES preference specification, the individual income distribution is

unimportant for the determination of date 1 prices and date U investments.
'

Notice that in equilibrium, individual portfolio choice is indeterminate,
because the strategy of buying a long-term asset at 0 and selling it at
date 1 has the same return as the short term technology. However, market
equilibrium requires that a 'representative agent' hold k1.

11

The ex post securities market banishes liquidity risk, as individuals can
trade claims to B storage at P1, as illustrated in Figure 3. However, since

agents are subject to income risk, expected utility E{G[a(R)a(l,R,6)J) is
lower than under the full insurance scheme.

IV. Alternative

In

Banking Structures

this section, we explore some alternative banking structures that could

arise in the economic environment outlined in section 1 above. One important
object is to develop the welfare implications of alternative arrangements, as
our presumption is that competition produces banks that maximize the expected
utility of the representative consumer.

Throughout our discussion, we imagine banks operating in the following
at date 0 with the bank,

way. Individuals 'deposit' the initial endowment

which will pay an interest rate r0 from period 0 to 1 and r1 from period 1 to
2 on deposits held during these periods.

Conditional on realization of 8, the individual decides on an amount of
funds to be withdrawn from the bank. From our discussion in section II above,
we know that we can write the optimal withdrawal pattern as

h(r1)[r0

where the second equality follows from (3) above.

For the bank, assets must be structured so as to meet the deterministic
pattern of withdrawals, i.e., investment in the short-term technology so as to
meet period one withdrawals

Banking Without Income Insurance

It is possible to interpret the ax post securities market as a deposit

banking institution, which provides a convenient starting point for our
discussion.

it

follows that agents simply accomplish their consumption patterns just as
above, withdrawing more or less depending on 0.

These individual withdrawal

fluctuations were represented as security trades in the ax post market.

Thus, this basic banking arrangement has some features that are typically

employed in analysis of banking markets: (i) interest rates on deposits are

equal to the returns on underlying securities over the relevant horizon
(r0 = 1 and r1 = R) and (ii) individual circumstances cause changes in deposit

balances that are stochastic, but cancel out across depositors.

In the

current setup, however, these individual "riskst' involve imply a lower level

of expected utility at date 0 than that obtained in the full insurance case,

so long as individuals are risk averse (G" <

0).

Thus, other banking

arrangements can potentially dominate this basic structure.

a tension arises between redistribution and

individual incentives that is analagous to the tradeoffs in the analysis of
principal-agent problems (e.g., Ross [1973]) and optimal income taxation (as
initially investigated by iirrlees [1971] and with a good overview provided by
Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980, sections 13-3,4]).

Deposit Rates and Income Insurance

By raising the interest rate r0 and lowering r1, the bank can induce a
redistribution from agents with higher incomes to those with lower incomes.

We begin by considering a small increase in r0 and a small decrease in r1.
The bank, of course, must respect its budget constraint, which is obtained
from

The form of this expression reflects that increases in r0 have an identical
wealth effect on all consumers, where a is the marginal benefit (in u units)

of a unit of period 1 wealth. As discussed above, a is invariant to 0 in our

CES example. By contrast, the wealth effect of an increase in r1 is largest
for individuals who are the greatest lenders in period 1, i.e., for those whom

Imposing the condition that dr0 and dr1 be feasible and

0,

the covariance term is unambiguosly negative, so

that a small decline in r1 raises welfare. Intuitively, by- raising r0 and

lowering r1, the bank has shifted wealth from those with high 0's to the
average individual.

In effect, at date 0, the bank offers an individual

security that has a certain date 1 expected return (dr0) and pays off
negatively when high 0's occur, so reducing individual risks.

Valuing Fractional Insurance

The extent of the demand for insurance in our economy is best measured by

the price that individuals would pay for artificial assets with individualspecific returns. That is, for any individual at date 0. wealth is a random

variable a(r0,r1,0) because of the idiosyncratic component of individual

Equivalently, the price must be less than unity if the covariance of x(8) with

increases in r0. Two further elements enter the formula that were not present
above: higher values of second consumption response to the interest rate or to

wealth raise the efficient value of r1, i.e, z/32 > 0 and z/(}E_) > 0.
These additional effects can readily be explained by returning to the bank's
feasibility condition and exploring the effects of changes in r0 and r1 laid

out in (15) above. The bank receives a return R on funds held over from t1

t t2, but must pay out only r1, yielding a 'surplus' that can be distributd

implies consumers withdraw much of the wealth,

leaving the bank with a small deposit base and little surplus, able to pay
only a low r1.

In fact, this idea of deposit base erosion brings us naturally to
discussion of a constraint not explicitly imposed in derivation of formula
(15) above. That is, in order for the income redistribution to work, it is
necessary that r1

at date tl so as to invest in technology A from period t1 to t2.

levels of an 'average' agent, i.e., one with 0

0. The budget constraint

facing this agent reflects the fact that r1 <

under deposit banking and

R

induces a substitution from consumption in period 2 to period 1. The 'tax on

19

saving' that the banking system• imposes lowers the welfare of this average

agent, since his consumption must fundamentally be constrained by the (per
capita) nature of social opportunities. Although the welfare of the 'average'
agent depicted in Figure 4 declines, the expected utility of agents (prior to
the realization of 0) is increased by deposit banking, because of a reduction
in the range of variability of individual circumstances.

Nonlinear Schedules and Ex Post Arbitrage

A priori, nothing restricts the bank to a linear pay-off schedule.
Indeed, throughout our discussion, we have employed the analogy between
deposit banking and distributive taxation: Mirrlees [1971] and others have
explored non-linear tax structures in some detail.

Although we have so far not made it explicit in our discussion and in
particular have not formally incorporated this constraint into Appendix B, we
assume that ex post arbitrage by groups of depositors would rule out any bank

contracts that made the interest rates r0 and r1 functions of withdrawal
amounts.

That is, even if depositors were limited to one withdrawal per

period, then nonlinearities in the bank schedules would make coalition
formation feasible and desirable.

1arkets in Derivative Claims

The deposit banking institution discussed above utilized no resources but

was a pure intermediary, purchasing one set of claims and issuing another.

This observation suggests that similar insurance could be delivered by a

particular type of financial instrument without the demand deposit
characteristic.

That is, suppose that at date 0 individuals can only purchase shares on a
"fund" that combines kB units of the short-term asset and (i_kB) units of the
long-term asset, where kB is the amounted invested by the optimal linear bank

discussed in the preceeding section. To make this conform as closely to our
previous discussion, let the "fund" announce that its policy will be to pay

Further, let the fund announce that it will pay shareholders r1 (principal

suppose that the market price

bank rates r0,r1 are feasible from the perspective of the "fund". Further,

is a rational expectations equilibrium price in the market for "fund"

shares since supply and demand for "fund" shares will be equated at that
price.

Notice

that the "fund" does not have a policy of "pegging" the price of

its

shares at one, which is one interpretation of the bank's policy in section

IV

above.

Similarly, it is commonly observed that banks have date 1

22

liabilities [(1+r0)} that exceed their date 1 cash flows [kB], which is
sometimes asserted to lead to banking instability. The "fund" described above
should not have such a problem.

The fact that a market in this type of derivative security can replicate
the allocations of the optimal linear bank has

important consequences for the

analysis of Diamond and Dybvig (1983). These authors suggest that the demand

characteristic is a necessary outcome of environments where individuals
circumstances are subject to privately observable random shocks.5 They go on

to argue that banking runs--viewed as self-fulfilling expectations that all
agents will demand funds in period 1--are a consequent potential outcome of

this sort of environment.

The ex p market in the derivative security

outlined above would not be susceptible to runs and thus would dominate the
sort of bank deposit scheme considered by Diamond and Dybvig (1983).
Derivative Claims and Ex Ante Incentives

Throughout the preceeding discussion, we confronted individual agents with
extreme choices of date 0: remain in autarky or purchase claims at date 0 from

the bank (by depositing one's funds) or from the "fund"

Now, we want to

imagine a single agent pursuing the following strategy: (i) at date 0, invest

a unit (part of fl

in

the long-term asset and (ii) at date 1, sell this to a

depositor from the bank at a price that the depositor will find yields a
higher return than the bank deposit, i.e., p

some c >

0.

Diamond and Dybvig (1983) consider a two state model with preference shocks
and a slightly different technology (see fn 6 below) but these differences
are inessential for the present discussion.

23

Is this strategy profitable from the stand-point of our agent? The answer
turns on whether the rate of return from 0 to 1 exceeds the bank deposit rate

r0. That is, we want to know whether p >

r

for some

>

0.

To discuss

this, we need to return to the bank's budget constraint in present value form,

Thus, there are incentives for individual agents to Ci)

asset accumulation rather than consumption. Basically, this result ref lects

the fact that the bank is engaged in insurance (redistribution) so that its
returns do not correspond to those given by the technology (in particular, the
return

Similar ex ante arbitrage opportunities (i.e., based on

decisions at date 0) would also occur in the "fund" case discussed above. The

incentives for individuals to avoid joining the bank in period 0 mean that

without binding contracts, the bank would not arise. This points out the
importance of refining the equilibrium concept employed in our analysis, a
subject which is on our agenda for further research.

24

V. Comparisons of Alternative Structures
In

autarky, each individual agent is subject to two types of private risks

stemming from individual income fluctuations

(0): (1)

pure income risk and

(ii) illiquidity risk, which arise from the interaction of the information
technology (the private character of 0) and the

production technology (process

B is irreversible).

Ex

security markets remove the illiquidity risk from

fluctuating

individual circumstances (9) by enabling agents to sell claims against the
returns from long term investment projects.

Consequently, in our setup, ex

p security markets dominate autarky, according to the expected utility
(pareto) criterion at date 0.6

Equivalently,

a simple banking arrangement,

could provide the necessary tpooling' of liquidity risks, as it replicates the

ex p security market. Such possibilities for pooling of liquidity risks
induce agents to invest more in long-term projects than they would under
autarky.

The optimal linear banking structure provides agents with a higher level

of expected utility than such a. simple banking structure or an ex
security market, however, as it partially insures agents against income risks

as well as fully against liquidity risks.

The provision of insurance is

typically incomplete because the bank faces a tradeoff between insurance and

6 This result
contrasts to Diamond-Dybvig [1983], who show an equivalence
between autarky and ex p security markets, in a model where agents are
subject to individual (privately observable)
preference shocks.
If our
technology B is modified to be partly reversible, with
payoffs (1-b) at t1
and R at t=2, then ex post security markets
will dominate autarky so long
as b > 0, i.e., there is a positive
opportunity cost to investing in B
rather than A. If b=0, the only
technology B will be employed and agents
will face no ttiliiquidity risks" in autarky.
Thus, there will be an
equivalence of autarky and ex p security markets as only pure income
risks will be relevant in each case.
ex post markets.

Further, no trade will occur on these

25

incentives for saving. Relative to ex post security markets, banks offer

higher short term yields (r0>l) and lower long term yields (r1<R). The
banking-insurance mechanism induces substitutions that imply that more
investment will take place in projects of shorter duration. Without income

uncertainty (if 620), an optimal bank would set r0 =

1

and r1 = R,

thus

serving no economic purpose.

In viewing an economic role of banking as providing insurance against
unobservable private risks, it is useful to consider two related insurance
concepts. First, in environments where there are substantial idiosyncratic
private risks, borrowing and lending can serve as 'buffer' that permits long-

lived individuals to smooth consumption and, hence, reduce the risks of
individual shocks. However, this insurance role of saving is bounded as long

as agents have finite lives or are sufficiently impatient.7 Thus, we expect
that our results would be robust to extensions to more time periods. Second,

it is natural to ask why one sees both cooperative institutions such as
savings banks and companies providing traditional insurance. We believe that

traditional insurance typically arises when individual circumstances can be
verified but not costlessly.

(Townsend, [1979].) Consequently, equilibrium

insurance contracts involve 'deductability,' i.e., the decision by the insured
agent that particular events are not sufficiently costly to warrant payment of

verification costs. By contrast, the insurance provided by our 'savings bank'

scheme does not require state verification. Thus, these institutions coexist

because there are many types of idiosyncratic risks, with varying costs of
state verification.

Grossman and Weiss [1982] suggest that the bond market can provide perfect

insurance, but a careful reading of their discussion makes clear that
incomes must be observable to obtain such a result.

26

VI.

Summary and Conclusions

In

this paper, we have discussed how a private financial institution--such

as a savings bank--can provide partial insurance against fluctuations in
individual incomes that are private information. In our model, fluctuations
in individual incomes cause income and illiquidity risks in autarky. Lx
security markets or simple banking structures that are pure intermediaries can

remove illiquidity risks, but insurance against income fluctuations requires

that bank deposit returns differ from those on individual securities.
Insurance is partial because the cooperative banking institution faces a
tradeoff between insurance and (intertemporal) allocative efficiency.

As macroeconomists, our principal interest in this framework is to have a

secure foundation for aggregate analysis and, consequently, several comments

are in order.

First, our formal model is the standard sort that most

macroeconomists have in mind when concerned with tmicro structure?: all agents

have identical preferences that can be aggregated, but individual agents
differ due to fluctuations in individual conditions that average out across

individuals (see, for example, Friedman [l969]), Yet, risk aversion and the

private character of individual income fluctuations, however, imply that
banking institutions of the sort discussed in section IV dominate conventional

market structures. Second, one might conjecture that responses to aggregate
disturbances--such as shifts in per capita incomes (y1,y2) or rates of return

(R) in our framework- -would be unaffected by the institutional structure,
since no risk pooling can occur against these shocks. But, in extensions to
our analysis, such an invariance to micro structure requires that aggregate

disturbances not be associated with changes in the dispersion of individual

security

27

income fluctuations. In fact, Haubrich [1983] demonstrates that the existence

of banks alters the temporal structure of equilibrium interest rates and
consumption-investment quantities

if there are effects of aggregate

disturbances on the income distribution.

Consequently, taking these two

observations together, explicit analysis of factors that lead to development

of specific institutional structures--such as private information--may also
alter our conclusions about aggregate responses.

Portfolio

Composition and Consumption in Autarky

We discuss optimal decisions of the autarkic individual using the typical
dynamic programming method of recursive optimization..

Decisions at Date.1

At date 1, our individual's portfolio composition (k) is predetermined.
The agent maximizes utility G(u) subject to the following two constraints:

The former of these constraints is the liquidity constraint. It does not bind

vNB(O,k) =

a(l)A(6,k).

Correspondingly, with the liquidity constrint binding, an agent has indirect

utility vB(O,k) [Ll +

(A_L)l']0.

In Figure A-i, we graph the

indirect utility function against 0. Notice that v is not linear in current
income, 6, when the constraint is binding, i.e., when 6 <

U

c - y1

-

and that agents have a higher marginal utility of 6 over this range.

Decisions at Date 0

At date 0, the autarchic individual selects k so as to maximize expected

utility, which is (A3) in autarky, where 6 is the value of k at which the
constraint just binds.

so that the first and third

Efficient Investment in the Liquid Asset

First, we demonstrate that an individual will subject himself to some
illiquidity risk in autarky, providing--as assumed in the main text--that
wealth is sufficiently large. Specifically, we require that if income is at

This is a variant of Arrow's famous proposition [1964] that a

risk averse agent will always accept a small amount of a bet with positive
expected return.

31

Second, we want to demonstrate that an individual will hold more of the
liquid asset in autarky than with an ex post security market. Consider the
value kE that is efficient in an ex p security market. This satisfies

IG(vNB(O,K))Jf(e)de = 0.

(A7)

Now, consider the crossover value

0E implied by kE. Above 0E agents are

equally well off in autarky and in an ex post security market. Evaluate

at kE. Then, it follows that

=

-

G(vNB(8,k))] IkEf(O)dO

The utility derived from a marginal increment of investment in the liquid
asset is always higher with the constraint binding for two reasons: Ci) as may
be seen from Figure A-i, the level of unconstrained "u unit" Utility (vB) lies

above the constrained level (vNB) and the strict concavity of G insures that
G' is diminishing in v; and (ii) the marginal "U
unit

of

unit"

utility obtained from a

period are resources is higher when the constraint is binding, i.e.,

vB/ak > avNB/ak.

Thus, it follows that EU/k is negative at
kE.

It is

tedious but straightforward to show that CA3) is strictly concave in k, so
that the efficient proportion of investment in the liquid asset under autarky
(kA) must be greater than kE.
