ABSTRACT
Intensive and controversial marketing of infant formula is believed to be responsible for millions
of infant deaths in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet to date there have been no
rigorous analyses that quantify these effects. To estimate the impact of infant formula on infant
mortality, we pair country-specific data from the annual corporate reports of Nestlé, the largest
producer of infant formula, with a sample of 2.48 million births in 46 LMICs from 1970-2011.
Our key finding is that the availability of formula increased infant mortality by 9.4 per 1000
births, 95%CI [3.6, 15.6] among mothers without access to clean water, suggesting that unclean
water acted as a vector for the transmission of water-borne pathogens to infants. We estimate that
the availability of formula in LIMCs resulted in approximately 66,000 infant deaths in 1981 at the
peak of the infant formula controversy.

Introduction
There is strong scientific consensus that breastfeeding is optimal for child health and

development (1-3). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants are
breastfed within an hour birth, exclusively breastfed for the first 4-6 months of life, and then
continue to receive breastmilk for up to two years (4). A recent meta-analysis presented
evidence on the importance of breastfeeding for child survival due to the unique biological
contribution of breast milk to the child’s immune response (5). The risk of all-cause mortality
is substantially lower in children who are exclusively breastfed for the first 5 months of their
lives when compared with children who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all,
receiving breastmilk substitutes instead (e.g. infant formula) (6). Children who receive
breastmilk instead of a breastmilk substitutes benefit from reduced severity of diarrheal
disease and respiratory infections (7), benefits in cognitive function (5), and longer-term
benefits for cardiovascular health (8). In 2012, the estimated aggregate economic loss from
shortened breastfeeding was $302 billion, and that 820,000 infant lives per year could be
saved if breastfeeding were increased to near universal levels (9).
Despite the scientifically supported benefits of breastfeeding, the use of infant
formula as an alternative to breast milk remains widespread (10). Less than half of
newborns worldwide are breastfed within an hour of birth, and only 43% are exclusively
breastfed from birth to 6 months (11). There are many reasons cited for why a mother may
choose to use infant formula over breastfeeding, including insufficient or the perception of
insufficient breast milk, lack of ability to pump breast milk at work, lack of family support,
depression, poverty, and other socio-cultural factors (12-14).
A key factor contributing to low rates of breast feeding has been the private sector
development and marketing of infant formula (15). Globally, the sales of infant formula
totaled US$44.8 billion in 2016, and are expected to rise to US$70.6 billion by 2019 (16). In
the early part of the 20th century, companies in the United States and Europe developed
commercial breast milk substitutes, partly in response to demand from women who had
difficulty breastfeeding. The use of infant formula rose steadily in the industrialized world
with post World War II baby boom breastfeeding rates dropping by half from earlier in the
century (17). Formula sales in the United States peaked in the 1950s and began to recede in

1

the 1960s due both to lower birth rates and mothers returning to breastfeeding. Infant
formula companies then looked to new markets in the developing world to make up falling
revenues, raising widespread alarm among public health and humanitarian advocacy
groups.
The beginning of the public controversy over infant formula marketing practices in
the developing world began in August 1973 when an article, The Baby Killer, was published
in the New Industrialist. The article stressed the nutritional inadequacy of infant formula
relative to breast milk (18), and provided examples of specific marketing abuses by Nestlé,
the first major formula manufacturer to enter LMICs (19) and the largest supplier worldwide
(20).1 At the same time, public health researchers documented a large decline in breastfeeding contemporaneous with the introduction of infant formula (Figure 1), and published
estimates of infant deaths resulting from the introduction of infant formula into LMICs
ranging from annual figures of 1 million to 10 million (21, 22). The article and research
became catalysts for activism against the infant formula industry, which ultimately led to an
international boycott of Nestlé products starting in 1977 and public hearings on the Nestlé
controversy in the U.S. Senate in May 1978 (17).
In response, the World Health Organization and UNICEF organized a meeting of
stakeholders out of which the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes
(ICMBS) was created and later enacted in 1981 (23). Nestlé, faced with the boycott, lawsuits,
and increasing public pressure, eventually agreed to abide by the ICMBS in 1984. However,
in 1988 the International Baby Food Action Network called for a reinstatement of the boycott
after evidence was produced that Nestlé had returned to marketing practices banned by the
ICMBS (24-26, 33).
Nestlé was accused of providing health clinics with free or low-cost supplies of infant
formula, often dispensed by “milk nurses” (saleswomen dressed in nurses uniforms), to
encourage new mothers in the use of infant formula (24-26). This practice is particularly
egregious because formula use among neonates increases the risk that mothers release the
prolactin-inhibiting factor, which signals their milk production to shut down, thereby

1

Nestle has consistently denied allegations of unethical marketing (17).

2

creating a future dependence on breast milk substitutes (27). In addition, critics were
concerned that Nestlé’s marketing included promoting formula to mothers unlikely to have
access to clean water and likely to possess limited technical understanding of nutrition,
physiology, or disease mechanisms due to relatively little formal education (19).
Inappropriately prepared formula (e.g. mixed with unclean water, or mixed with too much
water), can increase the risk of infant mortality due to the increased likelihood of diarrhea
and other intestinal infections (28).
In this paper we present, to our knowledge, the first causal estimates of the effect on
infant mortality of Nestlé’s entrance into LIMC formula markets for the both population
overall, and for vulnerable subpopulations believed to be most at risk. Nestlé’s phased
geographic entry into national infant formula markets over time in LMICs provides plausibly
exogenous variation in the market availability of formula conditional on location fixed
effects. We exploit this variation to identify the causal effect of formula availability using
difference-in-differences and event-history models. We estimate these models by combining
data on the timing of formula imports provided in Nestlé’s own annual corporate report with
data on infant mortality from 2.48 million individual birth records in 48 countries for 1970
through 2011 collected in Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (29).
2.

Data
Infant Formula Availability: Since Nestlé was the first major formula manufacturer to

enter LMICs (19) and the largest supplier by far worldwide (20), we proxy infant formula
being available in a country by whether Nestlé was actively marketing and selling formula in
that country. Annual data on the countries where Nestlé sells infant formula are found in
Nestlé’s 1966 to 2014 corporate annual reports, in the Manufacturing and Sale of Products
section describing international market activity (Supplementary Materials Figure A). We
8exclude six countries where there was already local production of formula before 1966.
Infant Mortality: We merged Nestlé’s information on infant formula availability in a
country with individual infant birth and mortality records from the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS), a set of nationally and regionally representative surveys of women between
the ages of 15 and 49, covering a large sample of low and middle-income countries. We

3

identified all DHS countries for which Nestlé began selling formula between 1966 and 2014,
creating a sample of all children born within the +/- 5 years surrounding the year formula
imports began, and added control countries from the same geographic region as each
treatment country, leaving us with a sample of the 18 treated countries and 28 control
countries, for a total sample of 2,478,842 children in 46 countries as seen in Table 1.
The DHS survey includes recall data for all children including date of birth, and age at
death if the child died, allowing us to construct location and year-specific infant-level
mortality data set. We designate any death of a child age 12 months or younger as infant
mortality and rescale the variable to deaths per thousand so as to yield rate-comparable
estimates (in deaths per 1000 live births) for population prevalence.
Maternal and Household Characteristics: We use several other variables of interest
taken at time of survey including children's basic demographic characteristics (sex, birth
order, date of birth), and mother's and household’s characteristics (education, type of water
access, asset quartile measure of wealth, and location). We use two indicators for broadly
comparable measures of socio-economic status: a variable indicating that the mother has
completed less than primary education, and a variable indicating that a household is below
the country median in the DHS’s asset index to proxy for household wealth.
Appropriate preparation of powdered infant formula requires combining the powder
with clean drinking water; safe water is critically important here because mixing infant
formula with unclean water presents a severe health risk to newborn infants. We measure
a mother’s inability to access clean water using the DHS water source variable that indicates
the water source most commonly used by the household. Surface water, the lowest-quality
water source in the DHS, is the water source associated with the highest levels of infant
mortality regardless of infant formula use (30). In our sample, surface water is used by
15.4% of households.
An indicator of surface water as the household’s primary water serves as our measure
of poor water quality. We assume that any woman currently using unsanitary water was
likely to be doing so in the past. However, there is some measurement error in this variable
as the steady decrease in unsanitary water use globally over this period implies that there

4

are likely to be observations that had unsanitary water in the past but do not today.
Improvements in water quality access in LMICs that have occurred since the birth of children
in the dataset would likely attenuate our estimates of the impact on mortality for the sample
designated to use unsafe water, implying that our estimates would be lower bound effects.
Macroeconomic Data: To control for the possibility that the timing of Nestlé imports
and choice of countries were endogenously related to economic conditions that could also
affect infant mortality, we include a set of country-level macroeconomic controls for
economic growth and foreign investment. Data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) were taken from the World Bank Development
Indicators.
3.

Identification and Estimation
Nestlé’s phased entry over time into national infant formula markets provides

plausibly exogenous variation in the market availability of formula conditional on location
fixed effects. We exploit this variation to identify the causal effect of formula availability by
estimating difference-in-differences models with location and year fixed effects. We
interpret the results as Intent-to-Treat (ITT) estimates that capture the average mortality
response to the availability of infant formula for purchase proxied by whether Nestlé is
actively selling formula in the country. Our estimated treatment effects represent the
intersection of adoption of infant formula by mothers within the exposed population and
the impacts on infants from consuming the formula. The impact on infant mortality will
also vary depending on whether formula is combined with clean water and whether it
substitutes for breast milk or for some inferior nutritional supplementation such as water,
diluted condensed milk, juice, rice water, or other low-quality substitute.
Specifically, we estimate the following difference-in-differences model using a linear
probability specification:
𝑚"#$%& = 𝛽𝑁"% + 𝛼$ + 𝛾& + 𝜆"% + 𝜑" + 𝝁0 𝒁𝒋 + 𝝓′𝑪𝒄𝒕 + 𝜖"#$%& ,

(1)

where 𝑚"#$%& is an indicator variable equal to 1000 if child i died during or prior to his or her
12th month of life to a mother in DHS region k, in country c, and in year t j and equals zero is
the child lived through its 12th month of life,; β is the treatment effect and is the coefficient

5

on 𝑁"% , which indicates whether the child i was born in the five year period after Nestlé began
selling formula in country c; 𝛼$ represents a regional fixed effect; 𝛾& is a fixed effect for year
of the child's birth; 𝜆"% is a vector of country⋅birth-month fixed effects to control for countrylevel seasonality in mortality; 𝜑" is a gender⋅birth order fixed effect for child i; 𝒁𝒋 is a vector
of mother and household-level characteristics that include household water access, mother’s
education, and whether the household is in the lowest wealth quartile in the country; 𝑪𝒄𝒕 is
a vector of macroeconomic controls that includes GDP per capita and Foreign Direct
Investment in country c in year t, and 𝜖"#$%& is the error term. We cluster the standard errors
at the level of the first-level DHS administrative unit, and weight the data using the DHS
survey weights.
We test whether the treatment effects are different for households that use surface
water versus clean sources of water, low educated mothers versus high educated mothers,
and poor households versus non-poor households. Specifically, we estimate versions of
equation (1) with interactions of β𝑁"% with indictors separately for surface water, low
education, and poverty.
Finally, we estimate an “event study” version of the difference-in-difference model
that allows the treatment effects to vary in the years prior to and following formula
introduction. Specifically,
𝑚"#$%& = 𝛼$ + 𝛾& + 𝜆"% + 𝜑" + 𝝁0 𝒁𝒋 + 𝝓0 𝑪𝒄𝒕 +

&<=
;>&?= 𝜏 ;

𝑇%; + 𝜖"#$%& ,

(2)

where coefficients in (2) are as in (1) except that 𝜏 ; is a set of 2m + 1 coefficients that
represent a child’s birth in different years within the event window surrounding the
introduction of infant formula within a country. We use an event window in (2) that ranges
from five years before (T = -5) to five years after (T = +5) Nestlé began selling formula. The
event-study estimations allow us to examine pre-treatment trends before formula
introduction and whether introduction of formula creates a break in these pre-treatment
trends.

Results
Table 2 reports estimates of the average treatment effects for the mortality effect of

formula from our difference-in-differences models. First, we note that drinking surface
water, having low maternal education, and being in a below median poverty household all
significantly predict increased mortality in all model specifications. Our estimates indicate
that a child born into a household in the bottom quartile of income that uses surface water
as its major source of drinking water, where the mother has less than primary education and
lives in poverty has a 40.1 per 1000 live births higher probability of infant mortality, or 55%
higher than the mean mortality rate of the sample.
The introduction of infant formula shows no statistically significant average impact
on infant mortality for the population as a whole (Table 2, Model 1). However, our results
show large and significant infant mortality deaths from formula introduction concentrated
in vulnerable sub-populations. Specifically, infant formula availability had a significantly
negative effect on mortality of infants born in households that used surface water (Table 2,
Model 2). The availability of formula increased infant mortality by 12.9 per 1000 for
households that used surface water relative to higher-quality water using households. The
net effect of formula availability is an increase of 9.4 infant deaths per 1000 among mothers
with poor-quality water.
We test whether exposure to surface water is a proxy for socioeconomic status by
adding interactions of formula availability with indicators for both low maternal education
and below-median asset poverty (model 3). We find that the estimate is practically
unchanged, and that mother’s education and wealth are insignificant. Thus, our results
indicate it is the combination of infant formula availability and lack of clean water access
rather than poverty that drives our results.
Although the combination of formula introduction and women’s education itself is
insignificant, we investigate whether uneducated mothers without clean water access were
more likely use infant formula in ways that put infant lives at risk, following reports that lesseducated mothers did not know that the surface water mixed with the formula needed to be
boiled or purified in some other way (19). We investigate this using a triple interaction of

7

formula availability with surface water and low mother’s education (model 4) and indeed
find that the elevated infant mortality from formula introduction is concentrated among lowliteracy mothers in surface-water using households. Estimating the effect of formula
availability on just that group (model 5) confirms this result and shows an even stronger
difference of 14.2 per thousand relative to the high-quality water counterfactual group.
Our event study estimates in Figure 2 show estimated differences in mortality
between those eventually treated countries and those not treated for the years before and
after formula imports began. We estimated the model for infants born to two types of
mothers, those using surface water and those using non-surface (higher quality) water.
There are minimal and statistically insignificant differences in infant mortality for treatment
and control countries for surface water and non-surface water households in the years prior
to the introduction of infant formula, minimizing concerns over possibly confounding nonparallel pre-trends in the difference-in-differences estimates reported in Table 2. The
introduction of Nestlé formula, however, generates a visibly distinct increase in infant
mortality in surface-water households relative to high-quality water households, one that
peaks three years after introduction, suggesting a wave of mortality coinciding with
increasing market penetration.
Finally, we test for any effect of Nestlé agreeing to abide by the International Code of
Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes in 1984. Model (6) reports the results of restricting the
sample to only children born after 1984, finding that the impact on infant mortality from the
introduction of Nestlé formula post-1984 for surface water households changes slightly from
9.40 to 8.34 but remains high and statistically significant (p < 0.01), providing no evidence
that the international marketing code changed mortality dynamics.
5.

Robustness
Table 3 shows four alternative specifications and robustness checks for our main

results. Model (1) reproduces the results from our preferred specification in main results in
Model (2) in Table 2 for comparison purposes. Model (2) replicates the same specification
using mother-level, instead of region-level fixed effects, allowing us to better control for
maternal and family characteristics. Identification, however, relies on the differential effect

8

of formula on mortality across two or more children born within the same family over the
sample period, implying that identification is driven by differences in older versus younger
siblings and a reduced the sample size. The coefficient on formula availability remains
virtually unchanged, and the effect of formula among surface water exposed infants
decreases slightly to 8.9 deaths per 1000.
We also estimate the same specifications using country-level fixed effects in model
(3). The coefficient on formula availability remains insignificant, but the effect of formula
availability on surface water households increases to 14.15, or a net effect of an increase in
11.42 infant deaths per 1000 among surface water households, indicating a slightly greater
impact than our regional-fixed effect estimations.
The DHS data relies on mothers’ recall to answer questions related to infant births
and deaths, which may add noise to our estimate and increase measurement error when the
window surrounding the introduction of formula predates DHS surveys by many years. In
model (4) we limit the treatment sample to the subset of 11 countries that were surveyed by
DHS within fifteen years of the beginning of Nestlé sales. We see that the results again
remain essentially unchanged.
6.

Discussion
The Nestlé controversy, one of most notorious allegations of corporate malfeasance

in the modern era, has been driven by concerns that the controversial marketing practices
used Nestlé to sell infant formula in LMICs had a large impact on infant mortality. In this
research, we combine information from Nestlé’s annual corporate reports on country level
activity with infant mortality from 2.48 million births in 46 countries to estimate the effect
of infant formula availability on infant mortality. Although we find insignificant effects on
infant mortality for the population as a whole, we find a large and statistically significant
increase in infant mortality among households without access to clean water, especially for
infants of less-educated mothers, corroborating many of the observations of health
practitioners made during the peak of the infant formula controversy.
The strengths of our study include the large number of countries for which there are
longitudinal data available, the use of corporate data to identify the year of Nestlé’s entry

9

into a country, and a very large sample of births over a long time period. Other strengths
include our ability to exploit the phased entry into LIMC markets over time to identify causal
effects using difference-in-differences models, confirmation of parallel pre-trends in the
event-history specifications, and the robustness of our estimates to a wide variety of
alternative specifications.
There are also limitations. First, we use only data from Nestlé, and although the
company has the largest market infant formula share in LMICs, we do not have data from
other infant formula manufacturers. Second, we only have data on whether infant formula
is being marketed in a country and not on the intensity of the marketing or its penetration,
nor on formula use. Third, we are limited to using infant mortality data and do not have data
on child morbidity; given the large effects of infant formula in immune system function, we
are missing the calculation of effects of infant formula consumption on diarrhea, respiratory
functioning and other types of infant morbidity.
How many infant deaths resulted from the introduction of Nestlé infant formula to
mothers with poor access to clean water? We estimate the number of deaths for 1981,
arguably the peak year of the controversy when media attention was the highest. We do this
by multiplying the 47.8 million 1981 live births that occurred in Nestlé formula sales
countries by the fraction of those households with surface water in those countries and by
our estimate of the impact of formula on infants from households with only unclean surface
water access, i.e. 0.0094 from Table 2. This yields an estimate of 65,676 infant deaths with a
95% confidence interval of [24,868, 106,485], lower than earlier estimates of one million or
more, but unquestionably a substantial loss of human life.
We compare the magnitude of the effect on infant mortality due to infant formula to
the effect sizes of other factors impacting infant mortality in LMICs. Specifically, we compare
our results to the effects of having an uneducated mother, lacking post-natal care,
experiencing a loss of 10% of a country’s GDP, lacking access to clean water generally, and
having no pre-natal care (Figure 3). Our estimated infant-mortality effects of formula
availability on surface-water-using households are on the same order of magnitude as these
other threats to infant life. For example, the introduction of infant formula to mothers
without access to clean water results in an increase in infant mortality that is roughly similar

10

to a loss in 10% of GDP, and somewhat greater than the effect of unclean water itself or the
absence of prenatal care.
Many of these deaths could have been avoided if more mothers had breastfed. There
are a number of effective antenatal and postnatal behavioral change interventions that
improve breastfeeding practices and thereby reduce infant formula use (35). Examples
include education and counseling during the prenatal period as well as hospital and homebased support in the postpartum period (36, 37), and effects of which can be enhanced by
including fathers (38). A very effective program is the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative,
which bans promotion of bottle feeding infants post-partum and supports breastfeeding
immediately after birth and throughout the crucial first few days (38).
Even with interventions that promote breastfeeding, some mothers will undoubtedly
choose to use formula. One message that emerges from our analysis is the critical importance
of making sure that mothers who choose to use formula, use it safely. Clear instructions
comprehensible to mothers of all education levels need to be included in marketing
materials, and for households that do not have access to clean water, chlorine tablets could
be included in the powdered formula or the pre-mixing of formula with clean water.
Finally, infant mortality may be averted by regulating unethical marketing practices.
The international community’s response to concerns over marketing was to create the
International Code of Marketing Breastmilk Substitutes (ICMBS) (31), which has recently
been extended to include inappropriate marketing of all foods to infants and young children
(32). However, compliance with the ICMBS is voluntary and violations of banned marketing
practices continue. A global watch-dog group, “Breaking the Rules, Stretching the Rules
2017” documented over 800 violations of the ICMBS by 28 formula companies in 79
countries between 2014-2017 (34).

The violations range from promotions claims that

mislead consumers, and surreptitious methods to influence doctors and other health
professionals, such as sponsoring medical conferences and partnering with healthpromoting NGOs. To combat these abuses, WHO, UNICEF and the International Baby Food
Action Network have called for countries to enact ICMBS legislation with stringent
enforcement mechanisms and penalties for nonadherence, and to closely monitor adherence
(16).

region. Model (2) replaces those with mother fixed-effects and therefor the main effect of surface water,

DHS survey conducted within 15 years of Nestle entry. Model (5) estimates model (1) restricted to the
sample of countries for which Nestle entered after 1984 plus controls All models additionally include
fixed effects gender, sex-specific birth order of child, country-specific birth month, and year as well as
linear controls for log per capita GDP and per capita GDP growth observed at year of birth. Standard

Supplemental Online Appendix
Data Nestle participation in country infant formula markets are taken from a table listing import and
production of different categories of Nestlé products across all countries in which the company operates, a
table which has stayed remarkably consistent over the five decades of data we examine (Figure A). While this
section has had slightly different titles over time, the layout and structure has been consistent throughout (See
Figures A below). We identify the specific category in each year in which baby formula is reported, a category
which changes over time and in some cases explicitly identifies infant formula and in others groups it under
“Milk-based Dietetic Products” and similar headings which we cross-reference from within the reports. We are
able to specifically identify the year Nestlé infant formula imports begin based on the coding of the reports and
the year infant formula begins to appear as an import into a given country.
