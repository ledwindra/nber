Employing hours of work in diaries collected by the American Time Use Survey, 2003-12, along with the same respondents\u2019 recalled usual hours, we show that the latter yield elasticities that are positively biased. We argue that this bias arises from the salience on recalled hours of differences in wage rates.\n\n",
