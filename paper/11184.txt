Outsourcing Price Decisions: Evidence from U.S. 9802 Imports

JEL No. F1, F2
ABSTRACT
This paper studies U.S. overseas assembly imports to identify whether factors related to information
or search costs appear to condition outsourcing decisions. The data for 1991-2000 show that U.S.
overseas assembly imports were characterized by incomplete pass-through of production and trade
costs to import prices, though products assembled in more highly educated countries passed-through
a much larger portion of their cost changes. In addition, the price of outsourcing imports responded
to competing suppliers' prices, with the largest responses occurring for products in capital-intense
industries. These differential price responses suggest that information issues play an important role
in the mediation of outsourcing relationships.

Introduction
A growing body of work in international trade focuses on the institutions and
economic conditions that facilitate the formation of international trading relationships.
For example, information is now recognized as a pivotal element in the globalization
process. Nonetheless, the benefits of informational improvements, such as reduced costs
of telephone calls or increasingly sophisticated bar code transmission and management
tools, are not likely to affect all producers uniformly. Rauch and Trindade (2003) show
that product differentiation in consumption or production produces a degree of “natural
protection”. As a result, improvements in information technology are likely to render the
greatest increases in the global integration for those markets where the matching of
differentiated partners is critical to the formation of successful international partnerships.
Overseas outsourcing is a component of the globalization process that has
attracted particular concern as the public has become familiar with the idea that
improvements in information technologies enable companies to reduce costs by
outsourcing inputs and assembly from lower cost overseas locations.1 Indeed, the growth
in overseas outsourcing has contributed significantly to the growth of trade volumes.2
It is certainly true that internationally fragmented production processes allow
producers to take advantage of factor price differences, and may even facilitate factor

1

Popular attention is especially focused on the domestic employment impacts of overseas outsourcing.
However, Amiti and Wei (2004) provide evidence showing that the presumption of outsourcing job loss
may be reversed if one also accounts for the simultaneous job gains associated with international
“insourcing”.
2
Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) present evidence from 10 OECD and four emerging markets which
indicates that increases in vertical specialization accounts for 30% of export growth between 1970 and
1990. By 1990 vertical specialization accounted for 21% of these countries' exports. A broad review of the
trends is contained in Feenstra (1998). In related work Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2003) document
that U.S. multinationals increased their vertical activities in the 1990’s, while Gorg (2000) and Swenson
(2004) study the empirical determinants of outsourcing location choices.

price equalization.3 However, Grossman and Helpman (2004) show that country cost
differences are not sufficient in of themselves to generate overseas fragmentation. Search
and customization costs, in conjunction with incomplete contracting issues, also influence
the outsourcing location choice. This is because the magnitude of search and adaptation
costs ultimately influences the market thickness of potential partners, which helps
determine whether Northern firms search for partners at home or in the lower-cost South.
A key goal of this paper is to examine whether outsourcing relationships exhibit
characteristics that are consistent with international trade theories based on information
search and matching issues. To set the stage, this paper documents pricing regularities
that characterize the pricing decisions for U.S. outsourcing imports that arrived via the
9802 overseas assembly program, which assists firms that use U.S.-origin parts, materials
or components in their overseas assembly operations.
The empirical estimates of pricing decisions are based on a simple Bertrand
model with differentiated goods which is modified to account for the cost structure and
tariff treatment facing outsourcing producers who participated in the 9802 program. This
framework allows one to pay particular attention to the pass-through of production costs
and the degree to which producers emulate their competitors’ price changes. A major
benefit of studying the 9802 program is that heterogeneity in producer input choices
provides rich variation in the production and trade cost measures which can be exploited
to identify the price responses for these outsourcing imports.
Use of these cost measures enables me to verify that U.S. 9802 assembly imports
between 1991 to 2000 exhibited a number of pricing regularities. First, only twenty to
forty percent of the changes in production costs were passed through to product prices.

See Jones and Kierkowski (1990), Arndt (2001) and Deardorff (2001).

More notably, the degree of production cost pass-through differed across country
suppliers. The pass-through was highest for products assembled in countries that had
more highly, and likely more diversely, educated workforces. There was also a weak
positive relationship between the capital-intensity of the industry, and the degree of
production cost pass-through. Finally trade costs were generally passed-through at a
higher rate than assembly costs, suggesting that firms can pass through costs that are
commonly borne by all producers to a greater degree than they pass through idiosyncratic
cost increases.
The prices chosen by producers of U.S. 9802 imports also responded to the prices
selected by competing assemblers in other countries. A ten percent increase in prices
chosen by competitors resulted in a two to four percent increase in prices chosen. In
addition, the responsiveness to competitor prices differed across industries in a manner
related to industry differences in capital-intensity: prices were strongly correlated with
competitors’ prices in capital-intense industries, while there was little correlation for
industries that were not capital-intense. Making the reasonable assumption that industry
capital-intensity is correlated with matching costs and information uncertainty, this
evidence suppports theories in which matching and information gathering problems lead
to differential trade elasticities. Furthermore, to the extent that capital-intensity drives
firms to choose intra-firm rather than arm’s length transactions, it suggests that the
identity of traders in international transactions has implications for trade prices.4

4

Antras(2003) provides a model based on difficulties in contracting to explain the prevalence of intra-firm
trade in capital-intense industries, and for capital abundant countries. However, while Antras shows how
capital will affect the mode of trade relationships, he does not explore whether the methods selected
influence other transaction characteristics that may affect country welfare.
3

These findings contribute to the growing empirical literature in international
trade, which shows how the identity of traders and the features of trading relationships
affect trade outcomes. Other work in this vein includes Feenstra and Hanson’s (2001)
examination Hong Kong entrepot trader markups.

Feenstra and Hanson find that

variation in mark-ups, both across products and across countries, is consistent with an
economic story in which entrepot traders add value, by providing quality sorting services
for Chinese-origin products. Another example is the work of Besedes and Prusa (2004)
which shows that heterogeneity in the duration of trading relationships is consistent with
the predictions from Rauch and Watson’s (2003) model of trading relationships. In
particular, most trade relationships appear to start small, suggesting that search costs
cause traders to test

suppliers first, only expanding their order volume once the

supplier’s reliability is ascertained.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

Section two describes

characteristics of 9802 outsourcing activities to help provide an overview of the
outsourcing relationships that are examined in this paper. Section 3 provides a model of
pricing, and the associated regression framework. It also develops detailed measures of
cost which are based on the procedural features of the 9802 program. The empirical
analysis in section four quantifies how production costs, trade costs and competitor prices
affected the prices of 9802 imports. It also examines the importance industry and country
characteristics for these responses and discusses their economic implications. The paper
ends with a brief conclusion.

2. Overseas Assembly and the 9802 program
To gain insight into outsourcing relationships I use data from the US program
often referred to as the Overseas Assembly Provision, which is codified in section 9802
of the current harmonized system (HS) of tariffs. The 9802 program is designed to assist
firms that use U.S.-origin parts or materials in their overseas assembly operations, by
providing a tariff exemption for the U.S.-origin parts and materials contained in the final
products.5 While the Overseas Assembly Provision, or 9802, comprises only one strand
of outsourcing activities – it does not capture U.S. assembly of foreign parts, or overseas
contract manufacturing that is based on U.S. designs and specifications – it represents a
non-negligible portion of U.S. trade. Almost 8.5 percent of all U.S. imports during the
sample period, 1991-2000, entered through the 9802 program. In comparison with the
broad outsourcing measures presented in Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001) or Yi (2003),
9802 outsourcing did not grow more rapidly than overall trade. However, the general
decline in U.S. manufacturing activity may explain why this form of outsourcing, which
is based on the use of U.S. parts and materials, did not grow faster than U.S. trade.
The major benefit of examining 9802 activities, is that the import data enable one
to observe outsourcing relationships at the product level. During the sample period, the
U.S. imported 4,676 distinct 8-digit HS (HS8) products through the 9802 program. Table
1 displays the country composition for these import transactions. Geographical proximity
appears to have played an important role in determining 9802 participation. While U.S.
9802 imports arrived from 182 different countries, many countries had only a slight
participation in the program. In contrast, Canada and Mexico were the most frequent

5

See Hanson (1997) to see a description of the program’s evolution.
5

participants, registering 3,518 and 7,940 unique (HS8-product)-year transactions,
respectively.
Measured by frequency, the majority of 9802 transactions involved assembly in a
developing country. If development is defined by membership in the OECD, only 19%
of the positive HS8-year pairs involved developed country activity. If development is
defined instead by country educational attainment averaging six or more years, 37% of
the positive HS8-year import observations were shipped from developed countries.
To provide a snapshot of the industry composition of overseas assembly, Table 2
displays 9802 activity for 2-digit HS industries (HS2). When the data are sorted by the
value of U.S. inputs in the 9802 products, the top three 9802 outsourcing industries were
electrical machinery (85), transportation equipment (87), and apparel and clothing, not
knitted or crocheted (62).6 For each of the HS2 categories, the table also lists the identity
of the primary country supplier, where the primary supplier is defined as the country that
shipped the largest total value of 9802 products in that HS2 category. This cut of the data
also suggests that the location of 9802 activities is greatly influenced by geographical
proximity. Of the thirty largest 9802 industries, either Mexico or Canada was the prime
location for nineteen. However, more distant country sources do top the list for some
industries. The fact that the biggest supplier for footwear (64) was Malaysia, imitation
jewelry (71) was Hong Kong, and clocks and watches (91) was Switzerland, suggests that
production decisions are also influenced by traditional notions of comparative advantage.

6

These are followed by, non-electrical machinery (84), apparel and clothing, knitted or crocheted (61),
Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments
and apparatus (90), Aircraft and spacecraft (88), and footwear (64). Table 2 is based on activity in 1993 to
prevent the possibility that the composition was affected by Mexico’s joining the NAFTA.
6

Finally, to characterize input usage Table 2 reports the U.S. percentage, which is
defined as the percentage of total product value attributable to U.S. parts and materials.
In order to reap the tariff benefits of the 9802 program, firms are required to record the
portion of product value that derives from dutiable 9802 import as opposed to nondutiable U.S. components and parts. The benefit of using these declarations is that one
can observe the relative reliance on foreign inputs at a product-country level, rather than
making an estimate that relies on input-output tables, and the undesirable assumption that
imported inputs are used in production in a proportion that is exactly equal to ratio of
imports relative to domestic consumption. The average U.S. percentage for products in
the sample of 9802 imports was 36%.

A cross-industry comparison of the U.S.

percentage shows that industries varied dramatically in their relative reliance on U.S.
inputs. This variation could be driven by a number of factors, including cross-industry
differences in U.S. comparative advantage, in organizational form, or in the relative
importance of parts and assembly. Cross product tariff differences should also influence
the incentive to use U.S.-origin parts and materials. However, while the U.S. percentage
of product value and MFN tariffs have the expected positive correlation, it is only 0.075.
Because the value of U.S. percentage varies greatly across products and countries,
it is possible to construct detailed cost measures at the product-country level that are
based on variation in production, tariff and transportation costs. For example, consider a
range of products produced in Mexico through the 9802 program. Each product i is
characterized by the percentage U.S. content associated with its production, or αus,ic.7 If
Mexican wages rise, production cost increases will be especially pronounced for those

7

The subscript c refers generally to the country of assembly, which in this case is Mexico.
7

products with the highest percentage (1- αus,ic) of their production activities located in
Mexico. A high percentage of activity in Mexico is also costly for those products that
face the highest U.S. import duties. In contrast, products characterized by a high value of
(1- αus,ic) benefit from lower transportation costs since there is less back and forth
shipment of U.S.-origin parts and material.

3. A model of pricing decisions
In this section I provide a model of outsourcing prices that I modify to examine
issues related to the roles of information and search in outsourcing relationships. I begin
by introducing measures of outsourcing costs that account for the unique input and tariff
structure of imports shipped through the 9802 program. I then modify a Bertrand model
of competition in internationally differentiated goods to relate the pricing of 9802 imports
to a producer’s outsourcing costs as well as the pricing decisions of its competitors.
Finally, I add interaction terms to the common pass-through framework to test whether
price responses are related to country or industry characteristics, and more importantly
whether such interactions are related to theories based on information and matching.

3.1 Production
Following Mendez (1993), 9802 assembly is modeled as a Leontieff production
process. To produce product i in country c, 9802 producers combine a fixed bundle of
U.S. inputs with a fixed bundle of foreign inputs and assembly. To characterize input
bundles, I assume that 9802 assembly involves a set of tasks on the unit interval that must
be completed in sequence.

A firm’s decision to participate in 9802 indicates that the

8

U.S. has comparative advantage in the early stage tasks, while the foreign country has
comparative advantage in the later tasks and assembly. If the point on the unit interval at
which U.S. processing ends and foreign production begins is denoted by βic, and each
task requires physical labor input Li, then U.S. input requirements are given by βic*Li
while the foreign input requirement is (1- βic)* Li.

Assume the price of U.S. inputs is

given by wus, while the U.S. dollar price of foreign inputs is wc. If U.S. inputs are
transported to the foreign assembler at ad valorem cost gic, the resulting production cost
when product i is assembled in country c is:
(1) Cic = [βic*wus* (1+gic) + (1- βic)*wc]*Li.
Since assembly countries differ in their abilities and distance from the U.S., the value of
βic will not be the same for all countries involved in the assembly of good i.8
When 9802 products are shipped from the assembly country to the U.S. two
further costs arise. First, the appropriate U.S. import tariff τi is applied to the foreign
contribution to product value, (1- βic)*wc*Li. In addition, the return of the completed
product to the U.S. incurs the ad valorem shipping cost gic.
As the description of production indicates, the underlying cost of 9802 imports
will differ across assembly locations for a number of reasons, including cross-country
differences in factor and transportation costs for the movement of parts and materials.
Cross-country variation is also generated by differences in production techniques that
cause the Leontieff input choices to vary by location as dictated by skills, endowments
and production costs. Finally, while time subscripts have been excluded for notational

8

Distance matters not only due to transportation costs, which are directly included in the measure of costs,
but also due to time costs associated with distance, as highlighted by Hummels (2001) and Evans and
Harrigan (2003).
9

simplicity, the costs related to overseas assembly will also change over time as wages,
transportation costs and tariffs change.

3.2 Demand
To model pricing decisions, I assume that product market competition is Bertrand.
Each country produces a unique variety of the outsourced good, which is an imperfect
substitute for the products arriving from other country locations. This implies that the
producer of any particular good faces product demand qic = d(PicC, PicC*, Ei), where the
demand for each product is negatively related to the producer’s own choice of consumer
price PicC, and positively related to the price vector of its competitors’ consumer prices
PicC* and to overall expenditure Ei on product i.
Although firm profit depends the producer price, product demand depends on the
consumer price. If we now define αus,ic as the U.S. share of product value that is exempt
from tariff, the relationship between the consumer and producer (PicP) price is given by:9

(3) PicC = [PicP *(1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* PicP * τi].

This can be rearranged to yield,

(3’) PicP = PicC * [ (1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi ]-1.

Firms now choose PicP to maximize profits:

9

The U.S.-origin contribution to product value is given by: αus,ic = [βic*wus* (1+gic)]/[βic*wus* (1+gic) + (1βic)*wc].
10

(4) π = PicC * [ (1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi]-1* d(PicC, PicC*, Ei) - Cic*d(PicC, PicC*, Ei).

This generates the familiar first order condition:

(5) PicC (1+ 1/ η) = [ (1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi ]*Cic.

Prices are determined by a markup over marginal cost. The marginal cost has two
components: trade costs are given by [(1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi ], while marginal production
costs are represented by Cic. The markup is determined by the elasticity of demand (η)
for product i. For purposes of estimation, we can follow Feenstra (1989) and arrive at the
reduced form relationship (6).

(6) PicC = Г [ {(1+gic) + (1-αus,ic)* τi }*Cic ), Pic*, Ei ]

Restoring time subscripts and adopting a log-linear form generates the familiar passthrough regression framework:

(7) lnPictC = α + β1ln([ (1+gict) + (1-αus,ic)* τit]) + β2ln(Cict) + γln(Pict*) + δlnEit + εict

However, this equation needs to be modified since recent work on import price data
demonstrates that cross country differences in quality are present even when trade data

11

are disaggregated to the fine product level.10 To account for unobserved differences in
product quality that are correlated with country development I add a measure of
development Dc to the basic specification. This yields the primary estimating equation
that is to analyze the prices of outsourcing imports.

(7’) lnPictC = α + β1ln([(1+gict)+ (1-αus,ic)* τit])+ β2ln(Cict) +γln(Pict*) +δlnEit +λlnDc + εict
As in the pass-through literature, the coefficients β1 and β2 are both expected to be in the
interval [0,1], which run the gamut from no pass-through of cost changes to complete
pass-through of any changes in cost. 11 In addition, the coefficients on competitor prices
γ and country development λ are both expected to be positive.

3.3 Heterogeneous Product Responses
The primary estimating equation assumes that pass-through and market reactions
are the same for all products in the sample. However, these assumptions fail if market
characteristics condition the degree of competition in product markets. Such differential
product elasticities are a feature of Rauch and Trindade’s (2003) model of matching in
which improved information increases the elasticity of substitution between
internationally differentiated product varieties, since improved information enables firms
to rule out unacceptably poor matches before conducting international partner searches.

10

See Hummels & Skiba (2002), Hummels and Irwin (2002) and Schott (2003).
Blonigen and Haynes (2002) predict and discover pass-through rates exceeding one in magnitude for
products that are subject to anti-dumping treatment. However this exception is caused by the incentives
created by the administration of anti-dumping cases.
See Goldberg and Knetter (1997) for a thorough discussion of the literature on pass-through. While I
examine the pass-through of costs converted to dollars, rather than the separate exchange rate and cost
terms, this is motivated by the idea that the majority of cost changes are driven by currency movements
rather than underlying changes in country production costs denominated in national currency.

11

12

While Rauch and Trindade explore the implications of informational improvements for
the evolution of trade relationships, their ideas can be applied to comparisons of trading
relationships across products. In particular, the effect of informational uncertainty in
reducing product trade elasticities should be greatest for those products where
informational uncertainty is the greatest. While Rauch and Trindade provide a model of
international joint ventures, it seems reasonable to expect that informationally-based
matching frictions will be every bit as critical to the formation of overseas outsourcing
relationships.
Grossman and Helpman’s (2004) work provides further reasons to expect
different pricing responses for different product outsourcing relationships. When search
costs are sufficiently high, Northern firms may seek partners in the high-wage North, if
the costs of search and adaptation have hindered the entry of potential partners in the
South. In particular, a greater number of Northern firms to attempt a Northern search,
since thinness of potential Southern partners reduces the probability of a successful
match, and consequently expected profits associated with search in the low-wage South.
While Grossman and Helpman (2004) focus on a particular equilibrium in which partner
search occurs in both the North and the South, one can imagine extending their
framework to a multiple country setting with wage shocks. In particular, if the relative
wage of one country’s workers rise, the interest in seeking a replacement country location
for assembly is likely to be greatest for products in industries that involve the lowest
search and modification costs.
Since there are no straightforward measures of search costs or uncertainty by
industry, I assume that the costs of search and modification, as well as search uncertainty,

13

are highest for technologically sophisticated industries and for partner searches in more
highly skilled countries. Search and adaptation costs are likely to be especially high in
sophisticated industries, for example, since these industries are likely to be characterized
by a large set of search criteria whose presence is difficult to verify. To examine whether
pricing decisions respond in a fashion that is consistent with the notion of costly or
uncertain search, I add interaction terms to examine whether industry capital-intensity Ki
influences the degree of response to competitor price changes or the degree of production
cost pass-through.

(8) lnPictC = α + (β1 + β1K*ln(Ki))*ln([(1+gict)+ (1-αus,ic)* τit])+ (β2 + β2K*ln(Ki))*ln(Cict)
+ (γ + γK*ln(Ki))*ln(Pict*) + δlnEit + θ*ln(Ki) +λlnDc + εict

The choice of specification (8) is further motivated by work on the organizational
form of international production. A notable contribution in this area is Antras’s (2003)
work demonstrating how greater reliance on intra-firm trade transactions can emerge to
solve contracting problems in settings that involve more capital.

Including capital-

intensity terms in specification (8) allows me to explore whether capital-intensity, which
correlated with differences in the organizational form of trade transactions, is also related
to transaction characteristics that may affect country welfare.
Of course, industry capital-intensity is only one transaction characteristic that
affects search and modification costs as well as incentives that affect the organizational
form of trade. Another way to proxy matching issues is to use education as a measure of
skill. While lower levels of education generally comprise a common set of skills, higher

14

education levels are likely to result in more heterogeneous skill outcomes in the educated
populace.12 When a firm seeks more highly skilled workers, its managers are likely to
face a more difficult search, since their criteria are no longer based on a minimum
education, but on identifying workers who possess training in particular skills and
methods.

To account for this possibility I also investigate the effects of including

interaction terms based on country education HEc.

(9) lnPictC = αic + (β1 + β1HE*HEc)*ln([(1+gict)+ (1-αus,ic)* τit])+ (β2 + β2HE*HEc)*ln(Cict)
+ (γ + γHE*HEc)*ln(Pict*) + δlnEit +λHEc + εict

4. Results
I estimate the pricing relationship using both OLS and panel regression
techniques that control for serial correlation. The findings support the price predictions
emerging from a Bertrand model of competition. In particular, unit import prices for
9802 products are positively related to production and trade costs. They are also
positively related to the prices charged by competitors. In addition, price levels and
responsiveness are found to vary with industry capital-intensity and country education
levels.

12

While low grades of education commonly provide students with an ability to read or do calculations,
higher education is more likely to be characterized by differentiation. (E.g., think of college educated
workers who choose not only majors, but subspecialties, or highly skilled technicians who have received
training in particular techniques and procedures.)
15

4.1 Data
My primary data for this project follow U.S. 9802 imports between 1991 and
2000. To quantify price responses in an outsourcing context, I use unit import values for
9802 imports as the dependent variable. These data are also used to construct competitor
prices P* which are defined as the average unit import value for competing country
producers in the same HS8 industry in that year. Finally, I use the U.S. and foreign
content declarations to create measures of αus,ic, which are fundamental to construction of
the production and trade cost measures.

The data appendix provides more details

regarding the construction of the data set, including the sources for the other variables
used in the analysis.

4.2 Estimation
Table 3 presents the benchmark estimates for price equation (7’). The estimated
coefficients uniformly show that 9802 import prices were positively related to
production costs, though the implied degree of pass-through was only ten to forty
percent. The regressions also imply that trade costs were incompletely passed through.
In each of the specifications the pass-through of trade costs was somewhat higher than
the pass-through of production costs.

The difference in estimated pass-through of

producer costs versus trade costs is statistically distinct, though the weakest results which
are displayed in column (3) are only statistically different at the 6% level. The greater

16

pass through of trade costs suggests that firms are able to pass-through common cost
changes to a greater extent than idiosyncratic cost changes.13
The results in Table 3 also show that there was a strong positive relationship
between prices charged by 9802 assemblers and the prices charged by their competitors.
The OLS regressions imply that assemblers incorporated forty percent of competitor
price changes in their own prices, while the later panel regressions in columns (2), (3)
and (4) imply that 9802 producers mimicked twenty-five percent of their competitors’
price changes.
Similar to Schott (2003), Hummels and Irwin (2002) and Hummels and Klenow
(2002), 9802 import prices were highly correlated with country development.

The

positive and significant coefficient on the OECD variable indicates that even within fine
8-digit HS products, those imported from developed countries commanded higher prices.
The most likely interpretation of the development coefficient is that developed countries
produced higher quality varieties of the HS8 goods. To examine whether the correlation
between assembler country development and product import values was robust, I turned
to two alternative development measures - an indicator variable for highly educated
countries, and the log of country per capita income.14 The coefficients on alternative
development measures were always positive and significant, while the remaining
coefficients in the price regression were qualitatively unchanged by the choice of
development measure.

13

Gron and Swenson (2000) find a similar phenomenon in U.S. car prices, while Besanko, Dranove, and
Shanley (2001) provide empirical evidence showing that firms pass-through common shocks to a greater
degree than they pass through idiosyncratic cost shocks.
14
Following Riker and Brainard (1997), countries are defined as “highly educated” if the average
education level for the country is six or more years.
17

The only coefficient that changed in magnitude as the definition of development
was changed was the coefficient on production cost. The coefficient magnitude rose
when development was measured by country education, and fell when country
development was represented by per capita GDP.

Since per-capita GDP is highly

correlated with wages, and hence, country costs, the coefficient on per-capita GDP may
have picked up some of the effects of production costs, thus causing the estimated
coefficient on production cost to fall in size. In contrast, when country development was
measured by the country education variable, the apparent pass-through of production
costs rose. This result is sensible since accounting for country education helps to control
for differences in country costs that were related to otherwise unmeasured differences in
worker quality.
Recent work on outsourcing such as Grossman and Helpman (2004) emphasizes
that the initiation and development of outsourcing relationships can be complicated by
issues related to partner search. Firms will only seek outsourcing partners, rather than
completing projects in house, when an outsourcing relationship is expected to yield
higher profits. In this context the relative attractiveness of outsourcing relationships
depends on the difficulty and cost of finding a partner in addition to the relative costs of
outsourcing versus in house production. On the industry dimension, I assume that the
difficulty and cost of finding a partner is highest for products that require complex and
highly specified production skills.
Before turning to the full capital interaction specification (8), I first examined
how the estimated pass-through changed if controls for capital were included in the
regression. To proxy production skill-intensity and specificity, I added the capital output

18

ratio as a control in the regressions displayed in table 4.15 The results in the first three
columns of table 4 show that industry capital-intensity was highly correlated with the unit
values of 9802 imports. In addition, the results show that magnitude of the effect of
industry capital-intensity on the unit import values differed for developed and developing
countries. The most notable effect of including capital-intensity in the regressions, is that
the estimated production cost pass-through rises somewhat, to roughly 28 percent. In
contrast, the magnitude of the coefficient on competitor prices remains unchanged.
The one coefficient that becomes unstable when industry capital-intensity is
directly included in the estimating equation is the coefficient measuring the pass-through
of trade costs. The most likely reason for the instability of the trade cost term was the
underlying correlation between industry capital-intensity and the level of tariffs, which
are a component of trade costs. In particular, U.S. tariffs were higher in less capitalintense industries.16

When capital-intensity is directly included in the estimating

equation, the capital-intensity term may pick up some of the variation that was related to
tariffs, consequently changing the apparent magnitude of the trade cost coefficient.
To examine whether industry capital-intensity influenced the degree of response
to competitor price changes or the degree of production cost pass-through, I estimated
interaction specification (8).

The estimates reveal a positive coefficient on the

interaction between industry capital-intensity and competitor prices, indicating that the
tendency to mimic competitor country price increases was positively related to industry

15

The number of observations declines since it is not possible to map all HS 8 codes to a 1987-value SIC
code, which is needed to connect the product data to industry variables.
16
In this sample, the regression of an industry’s tariff rate on the industry’s capital-intensity and time
yields: Tariff Rateit = .185(.015)-.031(.001)*ln(average KY)i - .0016(.0002)*yr. This regression is based
on the 24,253 unique HS8 product-year combinations.

capital-intensity. If capital-intensity increases search uncertainty, or search costs, then
producers in those industries may have felt confident that they could match their
competitors’ price increases without losing their assembly work to other country
suppliers.
To examine whether the availability of alternative outsourcing partners was
conditioned by industry capital-intensity, I regressed the count of competitors on
measures of industry capital-intensity.17 The negative coefficient on average industry
capital-intensity shown in specification (1) documents that the number of competing
source countries was negatively related to the capital-intensity of 9802 products.

To further explore how capital-intensity conditioned the number of competing
9802 country suppliers, I created separate competitor counts for OECD and non-OECD
suppliers. This distinction makes sense if developed countries were better suited for
17

“Competitors” were measured by the count of countries that provided a particular HS8 product for at
least one of the years between 1991 and 2000.
20

some assembly tasks, while developing countries were better suited for others. When the
count of competitors was defined by OECD membership status, as in specifications (2)
and (3), the regression results show that capital-intensity exerted a much greater barrier to
the presence of non-OECD suppliers than it did to the presence of competing OECD
suppliers. This could mean that products assembled in non-OECD locations were better
substitutes for each other, than were products assembled in OECD locations.
Alternatively, if OECD countries were more heavily engaged in the most skill-intensive
activities of skill-using capital-intense industries, they may have faced less risk of
displacement based on costs.
Since the capital-intensity data are only available through 1996 it is not feasible to
track the connection between yearly changes in capital-intensity and changes in
competitor counts for the entire sample period. However, examination of the time-series
data for 1991-1996 in specification (4), shows that the number of countries providing
overseas assembly assistance declined for U.S. industries that became more capitalintense.
Each of the auxiliary regressions demonstrates that the presence of competing
country locations was smaller in capital-intense industries. This may explain why firms
in more capital-intense industries were more likely to match their competitor’s price
changes. If these producers raised their prices, the greater difficulties and requirements
involved in successfully switching partners in capital-intense industries may have
insulated them from displacement by competitors from other countries. Alternatively, the
correlation may have arisen from market power, if an industry’s capital-intensity elevates
market power.

This view of competition bears resemblance to Feenstra, Gagnon and

21

Knetter’s (1996) finding that exchange rate pass-through for passenger cars was higher
for producers with higher market share. While it would be attractive to run a comparable
analysis to test whether their market share model explains pricing relationships in 9802
data, the lack of similarly disaggregated U.S. industry production data for each of the
HS8 products precludes the creation of appropriate market share terms.18
An alternative way to look for evidence that industry matching matters is to
include industry skill requirements rather than capital-intensity in the regressions. Table
5 does this by examining whether industry skill requirements affected product prices or
price sensitivity.

To measure industry skill intensity, I defined the skilled wage

percentage at the industry level as [non-production worker wages]i/[Total wages]i.
Columns (1) and (2) begin the inquiry by examining the direct effects of including skill
measures in the regressions. The coefficients on the skill measures show that the unit
values for 9802 imports were higher in industries that were characterized by a relatively
high skilled wage percentage. In addition, unit import values were higher for products
assembled in countries with more highly educated workforces.
Grossman and Helpman’s work on outsourcing shows how low search costs
enable firms to conduct more intensive searches, and how in general equilibrium the
expansion of search efforts will create a “thick markets” externality, due to the greater
entry of potential partners. In the 9802 context, we might expect that the search costs for
highly skilled assembly partners would have been the highest in countries that had highly
18

The data in this sample do reveal a high correlation between capital-intensity and 9802 market share,
defined as a country’s share of 9802 product exports in a given industry. In this sample, OLS regression of
a country’s average market share in an industry on the industry’s average capital-intensity and a set of
country dummies yielded: Average Market Shareic = .216(.006)*ln(average KY)i + ∑CC. When I estimated
the regression using panel techniques and random effects for country-industry pairs , or Market Shareict =
177(.006)*ln(KY)it + εict, the results show that for the years of available data to 1996, that country market
shares grew as the capital-intensity of the U.S. rose.

22

educated workforces, since the types of skills matter as much as the level of education. If
this is the source of the “thick markets” externalities, then country education should
matter the most for those industries that most heavily utilized skilled workers. To test
this idea, columns (3) and (4) added an interaction term multiplying the industry skilled
wage percentage by an indicator variable denoting whether the country’s population was
highly educated. In support of the “thick markets” idea, the strong positive coefficient on
the interaction term suggests that unit values were particularly high when a skilled
industry product was produced in a more highly educated country.
Finally, I estimated interaction equation (9) to determine whether country
education levels affected the pricing responses. The results show that country education
levels influenced the ability of assemblers to pass-through production costs to prices.
Column (6) of Table 5 suggests that assemblers located in low education countries could
only pass-through thirty percent of their production costs changes. In contrast, producers
located in highly educated countries were able to pass-through 97 percent of their
production cost changes.
To further investigate the effects of education, I replaced the indicator variable for
highly educated countries with the actual educational attainment for each country’s adult
population aged 25 or over. Overall, the results reported in Table 6 echo the findings
from Table 5. However, the use of a direct schooling measure allows one to ask whether
an additional year of education had a uniform effect on low and high education countries.
In particular, did an additional year of schooling provide a greater boost to the product
value of high or low education countries? To look at this issue, column (4) adds an
interaction term to measure the benefits of extra education for those countries that had 6

23

years or greater education. The results show that extra education proved especially
valuable to producers in more educated locations. While a 10% increase in educational
attainment for countries whose attainment was less than 6 years, implied a 3.5% increase
in product prices, a 10% increase in educational attainment was correlated with a 7.5%
increase in product prices for products imported from countries whose residents averaged
6 or more years of education.
As before, I tested for evidence consistent with Grossman and Helpman style
“thick market” externalities by adding an interaction term to the regression reported in
column (3), which multiplied the industry skilled wage measure with country educational
attainment.19 The strong positive coefficient on the new interaction term, indicates that
product prices were especially high when a skill-intensive product was assembled in a
country with a highly educated workforce.
Finally, I tested whether the level of education affected the pass through of
production costs. As column (6) of Table 6 shows, the ability to pass through production
cost changes to import prices was strongly related to the education level of the assembly
location. The coefficients imply that the median country was able to pass through 25% of
its cost changes. In contrast, a country in the top 25%, by education, was able pass
through 94% of its cost changes, while a country in the top 10% was able to pass through
99%.

19

I assume here that the supply of high skilled assemblers is greater in countries that have highly educated
workers, and that the cost of locating a match is highest for industries that require skilled workers. The
effect may be more complicated if, as in Grossman and Helpman (2003), the compensation paid to the
foreign assembler depends on the assemblers’ outside options, which are themselves correlated with
education levels. The indicator variables HEc in equation (9) are now replaced with HEc*ln(Education)c.
24

4.3 Robustness Checks
To check the stability of the pass-through results, I ran a number of robustness
checks. In each case, I employed the same estimating equation, as that reported in
column (2) of Table 3.
I began by running individual regressions for each of the HS2 industries rather
than the pooled sample, to learn whether there was significant heterogeneity in passthrough across industries. However, while estimation at the HS2 industry level does
reveals heterogeneity in the value of the production cost pass-through coefficient the
median value for the HS2 production cost coefficients was 0.229, which was very similar
to the result in the pooled sample. In addition, since textiles and footwear are believed to
be among the most footloose industries, I also estimated the pass-through equation for
this group of products (HS2 chapters 61 to 64).

It is interesting to note that the

production cost pass-through for those sectors was a bit lower, with a coefficient of
0.158. However, this degree of pass-through was not statistically distinct from the full
sample value of 0.200.
A second question is whether the production cost measures, which were based on
country price deflators, rather than country-industry deflators, provided too little variation
in the production cost to get good identification. While it would have been desirable to
use industrial production indices for each country-industry pair, no such comprehensive
and internationally comparable measure exists.

However, to get an idea whether

measurement error in the cost term affected the results, I replaced the general U.S. price
measure used in the creation of the production cost measure with 4-digit SIC U.S. price
deflators from Bartlesman, Becker and Gray. Since their data end with 1996, estimation

25

is limited to the years 1991-1996. However, when I run the regression for those years
with the old cost measure, and the modified cost measure, the coefficients on the
production cost terms are 0.253(.048) and 0.339(.047), respectively. While the degree of
measured pass-through is a bit higher with the new cost measure, the similarity of the
results seems to suggest that measurement error did not dramatically affect the results.
It may be noted that both regressions based on 1991-1996 prices yielded
production cost coefficients that were slightly higher than those arriving from estimation
covering the full sample period, 1991-2000.

This may indicate that the degree of

production cost pass-through declined over time. However, when I added interaction
terms to equation (8) which replaced the capital-intensity interactions with interactions
based on a time trend, the interaction terms failed to reveal any time trend in the pass
through of production costs.
Another question is whether the availability of alternative trade programs, such as
the NAFTA, affected the results.20 The phase-in of alternative trade programs is only
problematic if there was a correlation between pricing behavior, and the identity of those
producers who decided to enter their U.S. imports through NAFTA rather than 9802. To
provide a crude indication whether NAFTA participation affected the results, I estimated
the pricing equation without Mexico or Canada.

In their absence, the estimated

production cost pass-through coefficient is 0.259(.003), which is again very similar to the
estimate in the full sample. This suggests that there were no systematic differences
between the pricing behavior of firms that left the 9802 program in lieu of NAFTA trade

20

Provisions regarding the general custom’s user’s fee continued to provide benefits to 9802 participants,
even after NAFTA was in force. In addition, U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports were generally non-zero
during the sample period, since they were undergoing the phase-in process.
26

provisions and the pricing behavior of firms that continued to participate in 9802.
Finally, I experimented with changes in the expenditure term in the regressions.
While the regressions are run with HS8 expenditures as a control, it may be preferable to
use more aggregated measures of expenditure. However, when I ran the regressions with
HS6 or HS4 expenditure instead, the primary coefficients of interest were hardly
changed, suggesting that the choice of expenditure measure had no effect on the
estimated pass-through or emulation effects.

5. Conclusion
I document pricing regularities in U.S. 9802 imports to provide stylized facts
related to outsourcing decisions, and to examine whether the pricing responses are
consistent with economic theories of international trade that feature search and
modification costs or search uncertainty.
Pricing decisions for U.S. 9802 outsourcing imports show that changes in
production costs were only partially passed through to import prices; the full sample
results imply that a country assembling 9802 products was only able to pass-through 20
to 40 percent of any production cost shock it faced. However, assemblers located in
countries with highly educated workforces were able to pass-through a much larger
percentage of production cost changes than were assemblers located in countries whose
workers were less educated. The results also show that the degree of price response to
competitor price changes was magnified for products produced by capital-intense
industries. If search costs and search uncertainty are increasing in industry capital-

27

intensity, then the greater emulation of competitor price changes is consistent with
informational theories in which the elasticity of substitutions between internationally
differentiated products is diminished by search costs and difficulties. In additions, since
auxiliary regressions show that there were fewer competing country suppliers in capitalintense industries, it appears that capital-intensity was negatively related to Grossman and
Helpman (2004) style market thickness externalities, in the market for 9802 sourcing
locations.
There are a number of reasons to be cautious in applying the lessons from 9802
imports to the full range of overseas outsourcing relationships. Since 9802 is designed to
promote the use of U.S.-origin parts in foreign assembly, assembly represents a large
portion of many foreign countries’ contributions. If 9802 assembly tasks are well defined
and simpler to match and conduct than other forms of overseas outsourcing, then the
effects of search costs or search uncertainty are likely to be much larger in other
outsourcing contexts.

Data Appendix
Trade data
Data on U.S. 9802 imports for 1991-2000 were taken from United States International Trade
Commission (USITC) trade data as reported in the December editions of the IM146A. While the
data are recorded at the 10-digit HS level, the 10-digit data were first aggregated to the 8-digit
level. The dependent variable for the analysis is the CIF unit value of imports, based on the 8digit aggregates. Unit values were defined for each country-product year observation and
calculated as, Unit Valuecit = [Import value]cit /[Import quantity]cit. The subscripts refer to country
(c), product (i) and year (t), respectively.
Competitor prices P* were given by the average price of similar 8-digit HS products imported
from all other countries in that year through the 9802 program. Expenditure was defined by
overall spending for 9802 imports from all countries within an HS 8 grouping in the year, though
other higher industry levels of aggregation were also tested for robustness.
The 9802 data were also used to construct the U.S percentage of product value, αus,ic, which is
defined in footnote 9. The U.S. percentage αus,ic was used in the creation of the production and
trade cost measures. To avoid endogeneity problems, the sample average of αus,ic for each countyproduct pair was used when I applied the cost formulas.
To facilitate the use of industry data, the connection between HS product codes and 4-digit SIC
industry identifiers was made feasible by Peter Schott’s “HTS10 to SIC4 Concordance, 1989 to
2001” available on his web site: http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/pks4/sub_international.htm.
Tariff rates and transportation costs used to create the trade cost measure, [(1+gict) + (1-αus,ic)* τit],
were also collected from Schott’s website. A detailed description of Schott’s data is contained in
Feenstra, Romalis and Schott (2002).
Industry Characteristics
Data on 4-digit SIC industry capital-intensity, and skill requirements were collected from the
NBER Manufacturing Database, which is available from the National Bureau of Economic
Research data site, at http://www.nber.org/data_index.html, as constructed by Bartlesman, Becker
and Gray. Capital-intensity was measured as the ratio of Capital to output, while worker skill
requirements were measured by the ratio of non-production worker wages to total wages.
Macroeconomic Variables
Macroeconomic Variables were collected from the Penn World Tables: Alan Heston, Robert
Summers and Bettina Aten, Penn World Table Version 6.1, Center for International Comparisons
at the University of Pennsylvania (CICUP), October 2002. The variable p, the price level of
GDP, was used to measure country input costs when I used cost equation (1) to calculate
production costs.
Education
Data on educational attainment were taken from Barro and Lee’s data, which are maintained at
the, National Bureau of Economic Research, at http://www.nber.org/data_index.html. Following
Riker and Brainard (1997), the high education indicator variable was set to one for all countries
whose education level for adults 25 and older averaged 6 or more years in 1990.
