    "abstract": "\n\nWe study a reform that granted European cross-border workers free access to the Swiss labor market and had a stronger effect on regions close to the border. The greater availability of cross-border workers increased foreign employment substantially. Although many cross-border workers were highly educated, wages of highly educated natives increased. The reason is a simultaneous increase in labor demand: the reform increased the size, productivity, and innovation performance of skill-intensive incumbent firms and attracted new firms, creating opportunities for natives to pursue managerial jobs. These effects are mainly driven by firms that reported skill shortages before the reform.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nThe present study builds on the insights of two papers that were concurrently written: Beerli and Peri (2018) and Ruffner and Siegenthaler (2017). The first paper analyzed the employment, wage, mobility and occupational specialization effects of the labor market liberalization in Switzerland. The second studied the firm-level impact of the same reform, establishing its effects on the employment of foreigners within firms and on size, productivity, innovation, location and staffing decisions of firms.
