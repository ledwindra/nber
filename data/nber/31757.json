    "abstract": "\n\nTo improve public services at scale, public sector managers must encourage reticent civil servants to enact effective reforms. We show through a randomized controlled trial that when existing school managers have the tools to act as leaders, they can improve school management, student learning, and reduce teacher turnover. Additional management training differentially improved management but not student test scores. Managerial enhancements and student test score gains persisted. Our findings resolve conflicting results regarding the role of management in public sector productivity and demonstrate how public sector managers can signal reform effectiveness through personal effort, acting as leaders.\n\n",
