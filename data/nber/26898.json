    "abstract": "\n\nA financial constraint that prevents access to external funds induces non-classical measurement error in average q as a proxy for unobservable marginal q. Unlike classical measurement error, this measurement error biases upward the coefficient on average q in a univariate regression of investment on average q. In a multiple regression of investment on average  q and cash flow, the coefficient on cash flow is positive. The positive cash-flow coefficient indicates the presence of a financial constraint, but it does not indicate a shortage of liquidity to fund current investment. In addition, the coefficient on average q is biased downward.\n\n",
