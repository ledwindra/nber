ABSTRACT
The boom and bust in housing during the 2000s has led to renewed interest in the boom and bust in
housing between 1920 and 1940. The most commonly used housing value series for this period is
reported by Robert Shiller in Irrational Exuberance. We investigate the changes in housing values
in cities between 1920 and 1940 using a variety of alternative sources with many more cities available
for comparison than in the Shiller series. We find that all nominal housing value series show a strong
decline between the late 1920s and the early 1930s. However, all of the series except the Shiller series
imply that housing values in 1920 were well below the 1930 value and thus imply much stronger growth
rates in housing values during the 1920s housing boom. Only the Shiller series predicts a strong recovery
in housing values to within 5 percent of the 1930 level. All of the others suggest that nominal housing
values in 1940 remained at least 18 percent below the 1930 values and several series suggest that values
lurched downward between 1933 and 1940. The results suggest that a significant reconsideration
of the operation of housing markets in the 1920s and 1930s is required.

New Multi-City Estimates of the Changes in Home Values, 1920-1940
Price Fishback and Trevor Kollmann
The boom and bust in housing during the 2000s has led to renewed interest in the boom
and bust in housing between 1920 and 1940. Unfortunately, current multi-city estimates of the
changes in nominal housing values for the period are based on series designed for long run
comparisons. Leo Grebler, David Blank, and Louis Winnick (GBW, 1956, 342-356) created two
series, one adjusted for depreciation and another unadjusted, that covered 22 cities from 1890
through 1934. They created the series as a robustness check for their estimates of building costs
over time. Both series have received a great deal of attention because they are reported in the
past two Historical Statistics of the United States.1 In Irrational Exuberance Robert Shiller
(2006, 2009) extended the series to 1953 by splicing a time series of average asking prices in 5
major cities onto the unadjusted GBW series. This Shiller-GBW Hybrid series is now widely
cited in papers, in the press, and on the internet because it is combined with the modern CaseShiller/S&P Repeat Sales Price Index to create a continuous series from 1890 to the present.
Because the series are meant to both provide annual estimates and to be consistent across
long time periods, the scholars creating them did not use a great deal of information that is
available from other sources for specific time periods. Currently, the two GBW series suggest
conflicting stories about the path of nominal housing values during the 1920s housing boom.
The unadjusted series combined into the Shiller-GBW Hybrid has housing values in 1920 that
were 7.3 percent higher than in 1920, while the adjusted series has values that were 6.5 percent
lower; therefore, they describe drastically different pictures of growth rates in nominal housing
prices during the 1920s. During the New Deal period from 1934 to 1940, we have only the one

multi-city series used in the Shiller-GBW Hybrid series. It suggests a very strong recovery of
housing values to 95 percent of the level seen in 1930. Recent hedonic price indices created for
Manhattan by Tom Nicholas and Anna Scherbina (2010) raise some doubt about that figure
because they find housing values that are roughly 70 percent of the 1930 level and New York
City is among the 5 cities in the Shiller-GBW Hybrid.
We investigate the changes in housing values in cities between 1920 and 1940 using a
variety of alternative sources: the mortgage census of 1920, the family census of 1930, the
housing census of 1940, HOLC surveys of real estate professionals, results of housing
inventories performed under New Deal works projects for over 100 cities, and archival
information from the financial housing surveys performed by the Civil Works Administration
and used by GBW that allows us to more than double the number of cities in the GBW index.
We compare the new estimates to the BLS estimates of the rent CPI and the values of building
permits per family taken care of, for further robustness checks.
We find that all nominal housing value series show a strong decline between the late
1920s and the early 1930s. However, there are sharp differences between the Shiller-GBW
hybrid and the rest of the series circa 1920 and 1940. All of the series except the Shiller-GBW
hybrid imply that housing values in 1920 were well below the 1930 value and thus imply much
stronger growth rates in housing values during the 1920s housing boom. Only the Shiller-GBW
hybrid predicts a strong recovery in housing values to within 5 percent of the 1930 level. All of
the others suggest that nominal housing values in 1940 remained at least 18 percent below the
1930 values and several series suggest that values lurched downward between 1933 and 1940.

In addition, we compare the boom and bust in housing values in the 2000s with the 19201940 period, showing changes in nominal housing values, housing values adjusted for CPI
inflation, and housing values relative to income. In all comparisons, the rise in housing prices
during the 2000s was dramatically more rapid than in the 1920s boom. After 2007 the nominal
and inflation-adjusted national median values reported by all home owners fell sharply but not to
year 2000 levels. However, nominal and real sales price indices suggest that actual sale prices
have fallen back to the 2000 level.
The comparisons of the busts after the peak during the Depression are much more
complicated because of the major deflation between 1929 and 1933 and the huge drop in per
capita incomes during that period. Both the nominal and inflation-adjusted series show that
housing values reported by all home owners had fallen below their 1922 levels by 1940. If the
experience in the Depression is repeated over the next few years, and that is a big if, home
owners face the scary prospect that nominal and real home values might well continue to fall to
levels well below the 2000 level. On the other hand, the affordability of housing rose sharply in
both periods as housing prices fell and incomes grew.
I.

The Existing Multi-City Estimates
Currently there are two multi-city time series that are being used to describe how home

prices and housing values changed between 1920 and 1940. The coverage is limited and the
focus of the series is on developing consistent annual series that run from 1890 to the present.
The estimates that are getting the most attention come from a time series reported by Robert
Shiller (2005) in Rational Exuberance. Between 1920 and 1940 the series splices together two
time series: a series of home prices unadjusted for depreciation reported by Grebler, Blank, and

Winnick for 1890 through 1934 and a series of median home asking prices for 1935 through
1953.
For the period from 1890 through 1934 Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956, 342-356)
used information for 22 cities from Wickens (1937, Table 3 for each city). The information
comes from a series of surveys conducted by the Civil Works Administration in the winter of
1934 in 64 cities.2 Each home owner was asked the original cost of the home in the year the
home was purchased as well as the owner’s assessment of the current sale price he might
anticipate receiving for the home. GBW then used this information to construct a set of home
price indices for single family homes for each of the cities and then aggregated them. They
provided a raw set of estimates and then reported a set of estimates that took into account an
annual compound depreciation rate of 1 3/8 percent in the homes that they based on a careful
analysis of other data (GBW, Appendix E). Their discussion suggests that they felt that the
adjusted estimates were more accurate. They showed that their unadjusted estimates for
Cleveland and Seattle showed a much smaller rise in prices in the 1920s than three-year moving
averages of prices paid for newly constructed 1-family homes developed by Frank Garfield and
William Hoad for the same cities.3 This finding was consistent with their expectation that the
unadjusted series biased downward the home price rise.

2

The surveys were conducted in two ways, by visits from personal enumerators and a survey handed out
and then returned by mail. “A house-to-house canvas was made of all occupied residential properties within the
boundaries of every tenth block in larger cities and every seventh block within smaller cities. Where necessary to
insure sampling of all important areas, additional blocks, chosen by informed local agencies, were also covered by
the enumerators.” Surveys for a separate sample were distributed and to be returned by mail to four out of every
nine remaining blocks. The combined totals of returned surveys covered about 15 percent of all families in the
cities included in the survey. Wickens 1937, xv-xvi.
3

Garfield and Hoad (1937) used the underlying information from the CWA surveys of Cleveland and
Seattle that allowed them to focus on newly constructed costs of purchase of 1-family wood homes with 5 or 6
rooms.

In a sense the GBW indices are similar to a repeat sale price index because the owners
reported their estimated 1934 sale value and the price they paid in the year they purchased the
home. Shiller likely chose the unadjusted GBW index because it is most like the repeat sales
index that he and Karl Case have developed for the modern period. The argument for the repeat
sales index is that quality is held constant because the same house is being evaluated in the
earlier and later period. However, if the service quality of the home is depreciating with wear
and tear over time, the home being evaluated in 1934 is of lower quality relative to the home
when it was first purchased. The diminution of quality is greater the longer the gap between the
date of purchase and the time of evaluation in 1934. Had the home kept the same quality over
time, its value in 1934 would have been higher than a depreciated home in 1934, and therefore, if
the price index is not adjusted for depreciation, the growth in prices for homes of the same
quality will be underestimated. This problem led GBW to create the second index adjusted for
depreciation.4
Since the GBW index ended in 1934, Shiller spliced in new information for the years
1935 through 1953. Shiller (2006, 269-70) reports that the home price index for 1934 through
1953 is a simple average over 5 cities of median home asking prices advertised in newspapers for
Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, and Washington, D.C. For all but Washington,
D.C. students used microfilmed newspapers from the Yale University Library and collected
“approximately thirty prices for each city and year.” The information for Washington, D.C. for
1934-48 data came from a median asking price series collected by E. M. Fisher (1951), which is
also reported separately as series Dc828 in the Millennial Historical Statistics (Snowden 2006, 4The indices also suffer from measurement error that likely arises because in many cities the purchase date
for roughly half the homes was more than a decade earlier and it relied on the home owner having an accurate
impression of the selling price of the home in 1934, a year in which very few homes were selling.

515). Shiller notes that “the median series does not make any attempt to correct for home quality
change,” unlike the modern series that he and Karl Case developed. “Improvements in home
size and quality gives median home prices an upward bias, and this is why [he] avoided using
median prices outside the 1934-53 interval.”
Figure 1 shows the paths followed by the Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (GBW) adjusted
series and the Shiller-GBW hybrid series Washington, D.C. Figure 1 also includes three
additional series for comparison. The first two are the average value of residential building
permits per family taken care of for 257 cities: 1) all types of housing and 2) one-family houses.
This is a rough estimate of what builders considered a likely value added of new housing, a key
component of the overall value of the home with the value of the lot included. The third is the
rent portion of the Urban Consumer Price Index, which shows how rents paid by tenants moved
over time in 32 cities. Rents generally tend to move in the same direction as housing values; of
the 394 counties with over 50,000 people in 1930, less than 1 percent experienced a change in
median rents between 1930 and 1940 that moved in the opposite direction of the change in
median home values, while the correlation weighted by population was 0.36. All series are
indexed so that the 1930 value equals 100.5
All the series show a peak in values sometime in the mid to late 1920s The average
permit value series both peak around 1929 and 1930, while the Shiller-GBW Hybrid, the GBW
Adjusted and the Rent CPI reach peaks in 1925, ranging from 6.2 to 13.7 percent higher than the

5

Both measures of the average value of building permits per family provided for come from U.S. Bureau of
Labor (1941b, 16) and then were indexed so that the 1930 value equals 100. Measures were provided for onefamily units and for multi-family units. The CPI rent index is from U.S. Bureau of Labor (1941a) and adjusted so
that the 1930 value equaled 100.

1930 price. One potential reason for the difference in the timing of the peak for permit values
and for the remaining series is that the permit values likely do not incorporate the value of the lot
on which the building is located. All five series hit troughs between 1933 and 1935 that are
about 19.4 to 26.7 percent below the 1930 price.
On the other hand, there are distinct differences at the 1920 and 1940 endpoints. By
using the unadjusted GBW series, the Shiller-GBW hybrid shows that housing prices in 1920
were 7.3 percent higher in 1920 than in 1930 while all of the other series on the graph suggest
that housing prices and rents were 6.5 to 20 percent lower than in 1920 or 1921 than in 1930.
The Shiller-GBW hybrid index also leads to much higher estimates of the recovery to
1940 in home prices than the other series, as it reaches 95 percent of the 1930 value, 21 percent
above the trough in 1933. In contrast, the rent CPI and the average values of building permits in
1940 were at most 82 percent of their 1930 value.
II.

Single-City Indices
As might be expected, the multi-city indices disguise a great deal of variance in the

experiences across the country. Figure 2 plots the Shiller-GBW hybrid and the GBW adjusted
indices against the Garfield-Hoad indices for prices of new single-family homes in Cleveland
and Seattle, two of the 22 cities underlying the GBW indices up to 1934. The Fisher asking price
series for Washington, D.C., and a new hedonic price index series for Manhattan created by Tom
Nicholas and Anna Scherbina are added since Washington and New York City were two of the 5
cities used by Shiller to create the hybrid index after 1934.6 All of the series peak sometime

Tom Nicholas and Anna Scherbina (2010) created a price index for real estate transactions for Manhattan
between 1920 and 1939. For each month they collected 30 prices from real estate transactions and ran a pooled
hedonic regression and employed time dummies to capture the change in price adjusted for the features of the
6

during the 1920s although the timing varies such that Seattle peaks in 1924 and Manhattan in
1929 while the rest peak around 1925. They all hit troughs in the early 1930s, although the
Manhattan series bounces upward in 1933 and 1934 before dropping again.
Once again, the series differ sharply at the 1920 and 1940 endpoints. The Shiller-GBW
Hybrid and Manhattan indices are well above 100 in 1920 even though Manhattan is not among
the cities in the Shiller-GBW hybrid until after 1934. The Cleveland, GBW adjusted, and
Washington indices are all well below 100, although Washington is not among the cities in the
Shiller-GBW hybrid index at that time. In 1939, the Manhattan index is well below the ShillerGBW Hybrid and the Washington asking price index.
III.

Alternative Estimates of Housing Values
The advantage of the series discussed above is that they have values each year over an

extended period of time. However, they generally are very limited in the number of cities
covered. To complement and potentially replace these series, we show the results of
comparisons at key points in time during the period 1920 through 1940. We use two sets of data
to examine the changes in home values over the period. The first set are based on reports by
home owners of the sale value of their homes in the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses and in a
series of surveys of the housing inventory undertaken by the Civil Works Administration and

housing over time. Unlike the other series, the Manhattan series includes some commercial buildings and a number
of multi-family tenements that included stores on the first floor. They control for these features with their hedonic
regressions with dummy variables for the presence of a store on the first floor, although they do not provide separate
estimates without these groups. As a contrast, in the estimates of home values used below, home owners were
expected to provide values for only the residential part of the building if there was a store present.
The Cleveland and Seattle series were created by Garfield and Hoad (1937) used unpublished information
for the CWA survey that Grebler, Blank, and Winnick used. They focused on new 1-family homes with 6 rooms
and used the answers to the same questions about cost of homes at the time of purchase used by Grebler, Blank, and
Winnick. Fisher (1956) collected asking prices for Washington, D.C. homes.

over 110 other cities during the mid-1930s. The second are based on reports by real estate agents
to the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation of the minimum and maximum sale values in all of the
neighborhoods within over 100 cities of homes for key years between 1929 and 1939.
III.1 An Index for Average Home Values in 1920, 1930, 1933, 1934, and 1940
Constructing a consistent index for housing prices requires information reported on the
same basis for the same types of homes and information reported for the same sets of geographic
areas. We construct an index for home values for 1920, 1930, 1933, 1934, and 1940 from
average values for nonfarm owner-occupied mortgaged homes using information from the 1920
and 1940 censuses and from the financial survey performed by the Civil Works Administration
in 1934.
The 1920 Census performed a mail survey of mortgage holders as to the “market value of
the home on January 1, 1920 (amount for which the home could be sold within a reasonable
time)” and reported average values for 273 cities (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1923, 18,173-8).7
The 1930 Census Report on Families reported median housing values and the distribution of
As seen in the text, the while the Financial Housing Survey in 1934, and the 1930 and 1940 Censuses all explicitly
stated in their instructions that the value of the lot (what the Census termed as real estate) was included in the value.
The Mortgage Census volume (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1923) never explicitly makes the statements that the value
of the lot is included, although statements throughout the text suggest that it is, and E.M. Fisher (1951, 51) later
treats estimates of average values for 1920, 1930, and 1940 as comparable except for the fact that the 1920 estimates
were mortgaged. Sales of homes and the mortgages for homes, particularly one-family homes, typically included
the real estate beneath it, and the question in the survey asked about the value at which the home could be sold
within a reasonable time. Statements in the text suggest that the writers believe the value of the lot (real estate) to
be included in the average values. For example, in comparing differences in the rise in average values across cities
between 1890 and 1920, the report stated that “the high average values in the rapidly growing cities were partly due
to the expected rise in real estate values which has since taken place” (U.S. Bureau of Census 1923, 69). The
statement referred to 1890 values, which the census compared directly with 1920 values in several tables without
further comment. On p. 43 the Census reported that the average value of homes had not risen nearly as fast as the
rise in real estate prices, building costs, and interest rate on other securities. They argued that this “seems to indicate
that there has been an increase in the ownership of smaller homes,” which would have come about because declines
in the size of the home offset the rise in these other factors in determining the value. As can be seen below, the
Census and the Financial Housing Surveys were more careful in their wording in the instructions. To the extent that
respondents did not include the value of the lot in their sale value of the homes, a rise in values between 1920 and
1930 is overstated.

7

housing values for owner-occupied homes but did not specify the mortgage status or report
average values, so the information is not directly comparable with the 1920 information.
Fortunately, the Civil Works Administration in 1934 performed a financial housing survey in 64
cities spread across the country and reported information on the average value of mortgaged
owner-occupied properties for 40 cities that overlap with the 273 cities from the 1920 Census.
The CWA survey asked owners to provide an “estimated market value of the property” on
January 1 of the years 1930, 1933, and 1934. Values were “understood as the estimated market
values reported by the owners” and “not assessed valuations.” The values also included the cost
of the lot or site (Wickens 1937, pp. xxv, xxvi). We located hand-written summary tables for 61
of the 64 cities surveyed by the CWA at the National Archives Branch in Missouri in a group of
boxes under an entry titled “Drugstore Survey, St. Louis, MO 1926-1927.” The summary tables
provided average values for owner-occupied properties, owner-occupied properties free of
mortgage, and owner-occupied properties that were mortgaged.8 Separate averages were
reported in each category for single-families, as well. Wickens (1937) reported much of the
information (but not all) from these hand-written tables for 22 of the cities. Grebler, Blank, and
Winnick (1956, 344-358) then used information on the cost of the house at the time of purchase
for those 22 cities to construct the housing price index that Shiller used for his home price series
from 1890 through 1934. Wickens (1941) later reported some of the information on values for
the original 22 and an additional 30 cities. Michael Brocker and Chris Hanes (2012) use this

The tables were unnumbered but were titled Value and Debt Status of Urban Residential Property, by Type of
Dwelling: Mortgaged Properties and Properties Free of Mortgage , and Owner Occupied with and without Rental
Parts, January 1, 1930, 1933, and 1934. From that information we collected the information on all owner-occupied
properties, owner-occupied properties that were mortgaged, and owner-occupied properties that were free of
mortgage for each of the three years. We collected the same information for 1-family homes as well.

information for his analysis of the determinants of the rise in fall in housing values in this
volume.9
The 1940 Census surveyed home owners as to their mortgage status and the “value of an
owner-occupied home,” which represented “the amount for which the dwelling unit, including
the land as belongs with it, would sell under ordinary circumstances—not at forced sale. If the
owner-occupied unit is in a structure that contains more than one dwelling unit, or if part of the
structure is used for business purposes, only that portion occupied by the owner and his
household” is considered (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1943, 4). Volume IV of the Housing
Census on Mortgages reported the average value of properties for owner-occupied mortgaged 1family properties for 185 cities with more than 100,000 people (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1943,
Volume IV, Part 1, p. 80, 88-9). Volume II of the Housing Census also reported averages for all
owner-occupied homes for all cities and towns in Tables 21 and 23 for each state (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1943.
From this information we construct a spliced index for the average value of owneroccupied mortgaged homes (AVOOMS) with values of 100 for 1930 for the 40 cities for which
information was reported in the sources covering 1920, 1930, 1933, 1934, and 1940. The
AVOOMS index is created by splicing together two overlapping series with the 1930 value equal
to 100: a series for the average value of owner-occupied mortgaged homes (AVOOM) for 1920,
1930, 1933, and 1934 and a series for the average value of 1-family mortgaged owner-occupied
(AVOOM1F) for the years 1930, 1933, 1934, and 1940.

Wickens (1937, xxvi and Tables 5 8, 31, 32, 33 for each city) reported values of owner-occupied properties and
values of owner-occupied mortgaged properties for each of the 22 cities but did not include all of the detail found in
the hand-written tables. Wickens (1941, Table A10) later reported information on average values of owneroccupied 1-family nonfarm homes for 50 cities, which included the 22 from the 1937 volume.

9

To develop the 1920 value of the index, we used city averages for owner-occupied
mortgaged homes from the 1920 census and for 1930 from the CWA study. We calculated the
ratio of the average value in 1920 (AVi20) to the average value in 1930 (AVi30) for each city i and
then calculated a weighted average across cities using the number of families in owner-occupied
homes in 1930 (Ni30) in each city as the weight.
AVOOM Index20 = (Σ (AVi20/AVi30)*Ni30 )/Σ Ni30 * 100.
All other indices that were built up from individual cities are constructed with the same
procedure. In the 1920-1940 period the number of owner-occupied homes in 1930 in each city is
used as the weight. For the 2000s we use the number of owner-occupied homes in 2000 for each
city as the weight.
Since the 1940 Census reported average values for owner-occupied mortgaged homes for
only 1-family dwellings, we created a separate (AVOOM1F) index for 1930, 1933, 1934, and
1940 using the CWA information and the 1940 Census information for those types of homes.
The AVOOM and AVOOM1F indices in Table 1 use information from 40 cities that have
715,328 owner-occupied homes in 1930. As shown in the bottom of table 1, the cities include 1
of the 10 largest cities, 14 of the top 50, 27 of the top 100, and 36 of the top 200. We developed
the spliced AVOOMS by calculating the AVOOM/AVOOM1F ratio for 1930, 1933, and 1934
and then calculating the average of the three ratios. The AVOOM and AVOOM1F indices were
so close together that the average ratio was 0.99957. We then multiplied the average ratio by the
AVOOM1F values for 1933, 1934, and 1940 to get the spliced index for the average value of
owner-occupied mortgaged homes (AVOOMS) in Table 1. The values underneath the index

values are standard deviations of the indexes across cities using the number of nonfarm
homeowners as a frequency weight.
III.2 Comparisons of Indices for 1920 through 1934
The AVOOMS index in 1920 contrasts sharply with the Shiller-GBW Hybrid Index,
while resembling more closely the rent CPI and the GBW adjusted index. The AVOOMS index
in Table 1 rises from 86.1 in 1920 to 100 in 1930. This rise differs quite a bit from the decline
from 107.3 to 100 in the Shiller-GBW Index, which is the unadjusted GBW index until 1934.
Meanwhile, the rise is more consistent with the rises seen in Figure 1 from 87.8 to 100 by the
CPI rent index, from 93.5 to 100 in the GBW Adjusted Index, from 90 to 100 in the average
value of all residential permits and from 79 to 100 in the average value of single family building
permits.
Between 1930 and 1934 all of the indexes show sharp drops in prices. The AVOOMS
index falls to 82.5 in 1933 and then 79.3 in 1934. Meanwhile, both the Shiller-GBW Hybrid and
the GBW unadjusted index fall to 79.1 and 81.4, because they are identical from 1920 through
1934. Note that the GBW index adjusted for depreciation falls to similar levels of 82.4 in 1933
and 80.6 in 1934 because the adjustments for depreciation diminish markedly as the series comes
to an end in 1934. The CPI rent index falls even more than the other series to a low of 68.6 in
1934.
The relationships between the GBW adjusted and unadjusted indices and the AVOOMS
index can be investigated further because the indices share 20 of the 22 cities used by the GBW
indices. Casper, Wyoming and Reno, Nevada are the missing cities. We can also construct
AVOOM1F and an index for the average value of owner occupied homes (AVOO) using all 22

cities from the GBW Index for the years 1930, 1933, and 1934. Grebler, Blank, and Winnick
(1956, 344-358) developed their series as a check on the estimates of construction costs over a
long period of time; therefore, they wanted to create a long time series that stretched back to
1890. With the information from the CWA surveys the only way to achieve this goal was to use
the information that owners reported on the prices they paid for the homes at the time of
purchase, which included homes that had been purchased in the 1890s. As a result, they did not
make use of the value information reported by home owners for January 1, 1930, 1933, and 1934
or the information in the 1920 census.
The AVOOMS index of 84.4 for 1920 for the shared 20 cities looks much more like the
GBW adjusted index of 93.5 than like the unadjusted GBW index of 107.3. In 1933 and 1934 all
of the indices are much more similar ranging from 79.1 to 82.1 for 1933 and 78.5 to 81.4 in
1934. The AVOOMS, AVOOM1F, and AVOO are no farther apart than 0.3 index points from
each other in either year, while the GBW unadjusted and adjusted indices are within 3 index
points. The underlying information in each series has flaws. The GBW series rely on memories
of purchase prices paid at the time of purchase over an extended period of time and then needs to
be adjusted for depreciation in the home, while the AVOOMS relies on owners’ perceptions of
the market price in 1934 and how it compared to 1933 and 1930.
III.3 Comparisons of Indices for 1940
The AVOOMS index also contrasts sharply with the Shiller-GBW hybrid in 1940. The
AVOOMS suggests that home prices fell by 7.2 percent from 1934 to 1940 to a level that was
only 73.6 percent of the 1940 level. The Shiller-GBW hybrid index suggests a strong rise that
brought housing prices back within 5 percent of the 1930 values. Given that the 1934 to 1940

portion of the Shiller-GBW hybrid was composed of asking prices, it might be that sellers were
far more optimistic than most home owners as to the rise in prices over time. It should be noted,
however, that the Manhattan hedonic sale price index constructed by Nicholas and Scherbina
(2010) also shows a drop from the 1933 and 1934 prices that left the 1939 sale prices
approximately 30 percent lower than in 1930.
IV.

Expanding the Coverage of Cities Using Medians for the Period 1930 to 1940
One limitation of all of the indices discussed so far is their limited coverage of cities.

The AVOOMS index has the broadest coverage but it covers only 40 cities. The coverage can be
expanded a great deal for the period 1930 to 1940 using the 1930 and 1940 Census reported
values and a greatly expanded set of cities in 1934, 1935, and 1936 for which housing inventory
surveys were conducted. This requires a shift from the use of averages to the use of medians
because the Census did not report averages for cities in 1930 but did report medians. The
housing inventory surveys generally did not report averages or medians but did report
distributions of values by value categories. We used a formula for calculating medians using the
distributions of values that led to estimated medians that were very close to the 1930 and 1940
reported medians and thus appear useful for calculating medians for the 1934, 1935, and 1936
housing inventory surveys. See Appendix I for the method used and discussion of the
comparability of the housing value categories.
One advantage of following this median approach with the data from the Census and
housing inventories in the 1930s is that we can use similar methods to estimate median values for
the period 2000 to 2010 for reports of housing values in the 2000 Census, and in the American
Community Survey from 2003 through 2010. The Census and ACS asked home owners to

report values in categories and not as a continuous measure, so we use the same methods for
estimating medians in the modern era as in the 1930s. Even though there are other modern
measures of housing value in the form of resale prices of the same homes and median sales
prices of new homes, such measures are not currently available without a couple of years of
digging into local records for the 1930s. The use of median values for the reported sale values of
all owner-occupied homes including those not for sale can be used in both time periods. The
disadvantage is that we are relying on self-reported estimates and not actual transactions prices in
both periods. The estimates of changes over time should therefore be consistent as long as the
biases from such self-reported estimates are consistent over the time frame examined.
The resulting indices for median value for owner-occupied (MVOO) homes indices are
reported in Table 2 for a variety of sets of cities that reported in different years. The goal is to
show differences across time within the same sets of cities. Comparisons are also included using
median indices that use the same cities used by the AVOOMS index and the Shiller-GBW
Hybrid indices.
All of the indices indicate a sharp drop in home prices between 1930 and the middle1930s. For the 181 cities with median values in 1930, sometime in the mid 1930s, and 1940 the
MVOO index is 79.7 in the mid 1930s and then drops further to 62.8 by 1940. The 47 small
cities that performed inventory surveys for 1935 had experienced an even larger drop to 64 by
1935 and the values fell only slightly more to 63.5 by 1940. Forty more cities that did
inventories in 1936 reported a drop to 67.9 by 1936 and then to 66.9 by 1940. The AVOOMS
index followed a similar path as the medians, dropping to 79.3 percent of the 1930 level in 1934.
After 1934 it continues to drop but only to 73.6 percent by 1940. When the median index is used
for the same 40 cities as used in the AVOOMS index the drop to 80 in 1934 is almost the same

as for the medians for more cities. The median index for the 40 AVOOMS cities drops to 64.5 in
1940, which is similar to the drops seen for the other median indexes. The difference in the
drops for the averages and the medians suggests that the prices for higher-valued homes were
recovering better in the late 1930s than for the lower valued homes.
As was the case for comparisons of the AVOOMS with the Shiller-GBW hybrid, there is
a sharp contrast between the picture drawn by the Shiller-GBW hybrid and the median indices in
the late 1930s. The Shiller-GBW hybrid index for shows that asking prices in 1940 were 95
percent of the 1930 level. An index of median home values based on the 1930 and 1940
Censuses for the same 5 cities shows a value of 58.9 when it is not weighted by the number of
home owners, and 54.5 when it is weighted. In essence, these cities fared much worse than the
vast majority of cities because the median index for 1940 relative to 1930 values ranged from 62
to 67 percent for the largest 978 cities, including these 5. The median value reported for
Washington, D.C. in the census in 1940 was 81.9 percent of the 1930 value, roughly 9 percent
lower than the 91.2 percent value for asking prices reported in the Historical Statistics. This
implies that the gap between the changes in asking prices and census reported values was much
larger for New York, Chicago, New Orleans, and Los Angeles, the other four cities in Shiller’s
index. The 1940 values in those cities in the bottom of Table 3 ranged from 45 to 58 percent of
the 1930 value. The 22 cities examined by Grebler, Blank, and Winnick fared somewhat better
than the 5 cities examined by Shiller. Their 1940 median values were 63.5 percent of the 1930
values.
The coverage is largest for the census years 1930 and 1940. Information on medians and
value distributions for 978 cities includes all of the cities with more than 2500 population in the
United States and many smaller towns and cities. For each of the cities in 1930 and 1940 the

census either directly reported the median value or the distribution of values across categories
from which we could calculate a median value. For each city we calculated the ratio of the
median value in 1940 to the median value in 1930 to create an index with 1930 =100. Then we
calculated means and standard deviations, unweighted and weighted by the number of families
owning homes and reporting values in 1930, for different combinations of cities. For all 978
cities with 5.9 million families reporting values in 1930, the median value in 1940 was 62.2
percent of the 1930 value. Table 3 also contains comparisons of the averages across different
rankings of cities in terms of families reporting. Home values fell the most in the largest 10
cities in the country. The weighted index shows that the 1940 values were 54.7 percent of the
1930 values in the top 10 cities, which accounted for roughly one-fourth of the households
among the 978 cities. The standard deviation across this group of cities was also low at 5.57. As
more and more cities are included in the index, the 1940 value rises relative to the 1930 value so
that with all cities included the weighted average shows that 1940 values were 62.2 percent of
the 1930 values with a standard deviation of 10.2.
The situation looks the same whether using averages or medians for the values reported
in 1930 and 1940. The focus has been on medians because the family census of 1930 did not
report averages.10

From IPUMS datasets downloaded from Ruggles, et. al. (2010) we calculate

averages and medians for 89 cities in both 1930 and 1940. The 89 cities account for about 2.9
million families in 1930. The number of cities is limited to 89 due to limits on local geographic
coding of cities in the 1940 IPUMS sample. Using the medians, the weighted averages across

10

Wickens (1941) calculated averages for 1930 from census figures on the housing distribution data by making
assumptions about the distributions within each category.

cities showed that housing values in 1940 were 59.5 percent of the 1930 value, while using
averages for the cities, the values in 1940 were at 55 percent of the 1930 value.
In sum, comparisons of housing values using Census data for 1930 and 1940 show a
dramatic decline in housing values of over 40 percent for the decade. This is a sharp contrast to
the limited data on median housing asking prices for the five large cities used by Shiller in his
housing index.
V.

HOLC Values from 1929 Through 1938 Reported by Real Estate Professionals
An alternative set of information on housing prices is available from surveys of

neighborhoods performed by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation between 1935 and 1939. The
surveys asked local real estate professionals with working knowledge of the neighborhoods to
provide information on a variety of features of the neighborhoods, including estimates of the
range of housing values and the changes in those values over time within the neighborhoods for
up to three kinds of housing. In establishing the range the real estate experts gave a low and high
price for the typical homes in the neighborhood. We have compiled information for 83 cities
that allow comparisons between prices circa 1929 and the early 1930s (1932 through 1936). For
88 cities comparisons can be made between 1929 and 1937-1938. Table 4 shows the
comparisons when values for multiple years are grouped and for each specific year with the
number of cities and coverage of home owner households in each comparison. In all cases the
index is set such that the 1929 value is equal to 100.
The HOLC data show an even sharper drop in home values between 1929 and the early
1930s than the Shiller-Hybrid index or the census-housing-inventory information. In Table 4 the
lowest that the Shiller-Hybrid dropped was to 75.7 percent of the 1929 level in 1933, while the

low home values reported to the HOLC dropped to an average of 65.8 percent of the 1929 level
across the years 1932 to 1936. The drop was greatest at almost 40 percent for the 5 cities
reporting information for 1929 and 1934. Table 5 shows that the drop from 1929 to the early to
mid 1930s was even greater for the high-value homes. The average across cities for the high
value homes over the period 1932 to 1936 was 62.1 percent of the 1929 values with lows around
58 percent in 1933 and 1934.
Later in the decade the HOLC data suggests that housing prices recovered somewhat but
nowhere nearly as much as the Shiller-GBW Hybrid index suggests. The HOLC data in Tables 4
and 5 show that housing values in 1937 and 1938 had recovered to around 75 to 79 percent of the
1929 level for the high valued homes and 70 to 79 percent of the 1929 level for the low valued
homes. In contrast, the Shiller-GBW Hybrid suggests a recovery to around 90 percent of the
1929 level. However, this contrasts with the continued drop in housing prices shown by the
census-housing inventory indices, which had fallen to less than 67 percent of the 1930 value,
which likely was lower than the 1929 value.
VI.

Adding an Estimate for a 1920 Median
Thus far, we have not included a measure of medians that includes 1920 because the

1920 Census did not report the medians for all owner-occupied homes. The AVOOMS index for
average values of mortgaged owner-occupied homes is useful but it only covers 40 cities when
comparing 1920 to 1930 and 1940. As a robustness check on the AVOOMS index, we have
developed an alternative estimate based on comparing the average prices of mortgaged homes
for the 273 cities reported in 1920 to the median price of all homes in 1930. This comparison
has the advantage in that it includes all of the top 80 cities in terms of number of home owners in

1930 and 183 of the top 200 and covers 4.8 million homes in 1930. It has the disadvantage that
the ideal comparison would be between the median value of owner-occupied homes in 1920 and
the median value of owner-occupied homes in 1930. We can estimate a median value of owneroccupied homes in 1920 by assuming that the ratio of the median value of owner-occupied
homes to the average value of mortgaged owner-occupied homes in 1930 is the same as in 1920
and then multiplying the 1930 ratio by the 1920 average value of mortgaged owner-occupied
home.
Using data for 52 cities covering 758 thousand homes in the CWA 1934 survey, we
calculated a 1930 ratio for the median value of all owner-occupied homes to the average value of
mortgaged owner-occupied homes of 0.9235 with a standard deviation of .09. The unweighted
average was 0.922. We then multiplied the 0.9235 ratio by the average value of owner-occupied
mortgaged homes in 1920 to obtain an estimate of the median value of all owner-occupied
homes in 1920 in each city.
Table 6 shows the estimated indices for median values for 1920, 1930, 1934, and 1940
using different groupings of cities and offers comparisons with the AVOOMS and Shiller GBW
Hybrid and GBW adjusted indices. When all 273 cities from the 1920 Census reports are
included, the estimated median home value in 1920 is 81.5 percent of the 1930 value, rises to
100 in 1930 and then drops to 60.9 percent in 1940. We can add a 1934 median estimate for 75
cities for which information was reported in 1920, 1930, 1934, and 1940. For just those 75
cities, the median index rises from 83 in 1920 to 100 in 1930 then falls to 79.3 in 1934 and then
62.6 in 1940. For the 40 cities included in the AVOOMS index, the median index and
AVOOMS indices track pretty closely. They both move from 86 in 1920 to 100 in 1930, to
around 79 or 80 in 1934 and then fall off further by 1940. The median index drops substantially

more by 1940 than does the AVOOMS. Given how well the AVOOMS tracks the Median
measure for the 40 cities, it seems reasonable to think that the differences between the median
indices for the 40 cities and the 273 cities are based on the selection of the cities. Since the
median index covers nearly all of the largest cities and a much larger share of the population
base, the median index might well give a more accurate picture of the nationwide change in
housing values over time.
The indices based on home prices reported by home owners in the censuses of 1920,
1930, and 1940 look quite different from the Shiller-GBW hybrid index. The census reports
suggest that home values rose between 1920 and 1930 rather than the fall described by the
Shiller-GBW index. The GBW adjusted index more closely matches the census information. In
the 1930s all measures agree that there was a significant drop in housing prices between
1929/1930 and the middle 1930s. But the measures diverge again thereafter. The Shiller-GBW
asking price measures suggest a rise in prices that almost reached the 1930 level, while the
remaining measures all suggest that home values in the late 1930s remained 26 to 40 percent
below the 1930 values.
VII.

When and How High Was the Peak Home Value in the 1920s?

Currently, there are five multi-city indices that describe or might proxy the path of housing
values during the 1920s: the GBW adjusted and unadjusted series, the rent CPI, the average
value of all building permits per family taken care of, and the average value of one-family
building permits. The two most closely aligned with our AVOOMS are the unadjusted and
adjusted series created by Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956) with homeowners reporting
values at various points in time. We can improve on the GBW series by adding an additional 31

cities to the 22 cities that they used. The information for the additional cities comes from the
hand-written tables derived from the CWA financial survey of 1934 and found in the U.S.
Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce Record Group at the National Archives. We
followed Grebler, Blank, and Winnick’s methods in constructing the index. For example, to
create the unadjusted index for the year 1920 for each city, we divided the average “cost of
purchase of homes” bought in 1920 from the survey and divided by the average “value of the
homes” the home owner reported for January 1, 1934 for that same group of homes. To match
all of our other comparisons, we then indexed the series so that the 1930 value in the city was
equal to 100.11 We then aggregated across cities in two ways: an unweighted average across
cities and a weighted average using the number of families in owner-occupied homes reporting
values in the 1930 census. To create a series adjusted for depreciation, we followed Grebler,
Blank, and Winnick by using a 1 3/8 percent compounded annual depreciation rate.
The original GBW series and the New GBW-Style series using different weighting schemes
are reported in Table 7 along with the number of cities covered and the number of families in
those cities reporting values for owner-occupied homes in the 1930 census. In comparisons of
the unadjusted series, the new weighted series starts 1.6 points lower than the original GBW
unadjusted series, hits a peak that is 0.5 points higher in 1925, and then falls to a trough in 1933
that is 2.3 points higher. For the series adjusted for depreciation, the new weighted series starts
1.5 points lower than the original GBW series in 1920 hits at peak in 1926 that is 4 points higher
than hits a trough in 1933 that is 4.2 points higher than the trough in 1934 for the original GBW
adjusted series.

11

Our calculations for Seattle and Cleveland exactly matched those reported by Grebler, Blank, and Winnick
(1956).

Another way to use the New Series is to use the information to interpolate between the
benchmark estimates for the AVOOMS for 40 cities for the years 1920, 1930, 1933, 1934 and
the benchmarks for 46 cities using the median estimates for 1920, 1930, and 1934.12 We
interpolate for each city individually and then aggregate across cities. Consider the
interpolations for the AVOOMS using the New Adjusted Series as an example. We start with
the benchmark values for 1920, 1930, 1933, and 1934. We then create ratios of the AVOOMS to
the New GBW-Style Adjusted Series in each of those years. For the period between 1920 and
1930 we used a straight-line interpolation to create interpolated ratios for each year. To get the
value for 1921 we then multiply the interpolated ratio by the New Adjusted GBW-Style value in
1921; similar calculations were made for 1922 through 1939. A similar process was used to
obtain values for 1931 and 1932.13 This method was used for all other interpolations. We then
aggregated across cities using weighted averages with the number of families in owner-occupied
homes reporting values in the 1930 Census as the weights.
We have interpolated the AVOOMS and the median series using both the new unadjusted
series and the new adjusted series. The two AVOOMS series in Table 7 show that there is not
much difference in the values that are interpolated by the adjusted and those interpolated by the
unadjusted series for the 1920s, as they are never more than 0.4 points apart. When the time
series are forced to match the benchmarks in 1920 and 1930, the main differences come in the
We can create the AVOOMS interpolated series for up to 45 cities if we stop in 1934. The requirement to have a
value for 1940 from the Census drops 5 cities that are all outside the top 100 cities in terms of population. The
number of families in 1930 lost is 21536. The difference in the index is at most 0.4 in any one of the years. We
reported the AVOOMS for 40 cities only to save space.

The formula used was the following with the number referring to the year, the ratio is R, AV is the AVOOMS
index and AS is the adjusted series. We calculated R20=AV20/AS20 and R30=AV30/AS30. For the 1921 ratio the
ratio is
R21=R20*0.9+R30*0.1, the 1921 interpolated value (IAV21) is IAV21=R21*AS21.

timing and the size of the peaks and both the unadjusted and adjusted time series have peaks at
roughly the same time.
In addition to the AVOOMS and Median series, we have included the Shiller-GBW hybrid,
the rent CPI, and the average values of building permit series in Table 7 so that it is easy to
compare all rises and falls in housing values. Many of the series also appear in Figure 4. Table
7 also includes 1940 values for the series that have values in that year. All of the series show a
peak in housing values in 1925 or 1926 with the exception of the average values for building
permits, which peak in 1929 and 1930. The largest growth rate in value between 1920 and the
peak is 26 percent for the rent CPI, followed by the AVOOMS and Median indices at around 21
or 22 percent. The smallest growth is 3.6 percent for the unweighted new series and only 6
percent for the original GBW unadjusted series and the Shiller-GBW Hybrid.
The largest decline in value between the peak in the 1920s and the trough after 1930 is a 38.6
percent decline for the median series from a peak of 104.9 in 1926 to a low of 64.4 in 1940. This
is rivaled by the drops for the rent CPI of 38 percent from the peak of 110.7 in 1925 to the
bottom of 68.6 in 1934. Both AVOOMS series fall roughly 30 percent from peaks above 105 in
1926 to a low of 73.6 in 1940. The Shiller-GBW Hybrid also falls about 30 percent from a peak
of 113.8 in 1925 to a bottom of 79.1 in 1933. The smallest declines are the falls of around 21
percent for the New Adjusted series for 53 cities from peaks in 1925 to troughs in 1933.
The bottom line for all of the series is that they all peak sometime between 1925 and 1930,
and they all fall sharply by 20 to 30 percent by around 1933 or 1934. The differences lie in the
estimates of the rise from 1920 to the peak and the changes in prices after 1934. The indices
based on the unadjusted GBW methods, including the Shiller-GBW Hybrid all start in 1920 at a

level above the value in 1930 and thus end up with a relatively small rise to the peak of 3 to 8
percent between 1920 and the mid 1920s. All of the remaining indices start at least 6.5 percent
below the 1920 level and thus show rises to from 1920 to the 1920s peak of 13.5 to 26 percent.
After 1940, the Shiller-GBW Hybrid suggests a rise in home values to 95 percent of the 1930
value, while all other series show 1940 values that are 18 to 36 percent below the 1930 values.
VIII. COMPARISONS TO MODERN SERIES
To make the comparisons in of housing price trends across periods, we sought to use
similar data and the same methods in the 2000s as we used in the 1920s and 1930s. There are a
number of home price and value series available in the 2000s. We focus on the surveys followed
the lead of surveys in the 1920s and 1930s by asking all home owners to report the sale value of
their home, whether the home was for sale or not. The Census of 2000 and the American
Community Surveys between 2003 and 2010 asked home owners “to estimate the full current
market value of the property, including both house and land, even if the respondents owned only
part of the property.” “Apart from group quarters, all owner-occupied or vacant-for-sale units
were covered, including mobile homes, condominiums, units with offices or businesses attached,
and houses on lots of any size. For mobile homes in pre-2008 ACS and PRCS data, the value of
the land was included in the value; in the 2008 ACS…, land value was included only if the
owner of the mobile home also owned the land.”
The 2000 Survey and the ACS surveys asked people to report their home sale values by
marking the value category for the home. As a result, the reporting of the information looks very
much like the summary tables in the 1930 and 1940 censuses and in the inventory surveys in the

mid 1930s. Therefore, we used the method for calculating medians that we used for the
inventory surveys in the mid-1930s.
Table 8 shows medians indexed so that the 2000 value is equal to 100 for a variety of
groupings of cities. Indexes across time were calculated for each city using the medians in that
city and then were aggregated as a weighted average with the number of owner-occupied homes
reporting values in 2000 as the weight. The Case-Shiller repeat sales price index for 10 cities
and for 20 cities receives a great deal of attention; therefore, we show the median home values
for the Case-Shiller 10-city and 20-city groupings, as well as information for the Top 50, 100,
400, and all cities. Table 8 also contains the Case-Shiller and Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) Repeat Sales Indices and the Median New Home Sale Price
Index for comparisons.
The rise in nominal house prices in the 2000 to 2007 housing boom far outstrips the rise
in prices during the housing boom of the 1920s. All of the median values in Table 8 peaked in
2007. The increases between 2000 and 2007 ranged from a high of 125 percent for the 10 cities
used in the Case Shiller Index to a low of 91.6 percent for the 400 cities with the most home
owners in 2000. These growth rates are 4 to 5 times greater than the growth rates of 21 to 22
percent between 1920 and the peak in the mid 1920s shown by the AVOOMS and Median
indices in Table 7. The housing value growth in the 1920s is also substantially lower than
housing price growth rates shown by the sale price indices in Table 8, which range from 46.4
percent for new home prices to 109.1 percent for the Case-Shiller-10-city index.
Arguably, the fall in nominal housing prices between 1930 and 1933 was worse than the
fall in prices between 2007 and 2010. Here is a case where percentage drops do not tell the

whole story. The AVOOMS and Median indices in Table 7 fell by roughly 17 to 20 percent
between 1930 and 1933. The median home values in 2000 fell by 12 to 17 percent from 2007 to
2010, depending on the group of homes examined. A better comparison to the damage done to
housing values is how the housing values compared to the start of the periods in 1920 and 2000.
In 2010 all the housing indices all show prices that are 32 to 86.8 percent higher than they were
in 2000. In contrast, by 1933 the home values were lower than they were in 1920. Whereas in
the Great Recession people saw part of the rise in housing values fall away, during the Great
Depression, the entire rise was eliminated and housing prices fell still more. The AVOOMS and
the Median estimates in Tables 6 and 7 show that the situation got even worse by 1940, such that
home values were 14.5 to 25.5 percent lower than in 1920.

IX.

Deflating the Home Price Series by the CPI and Nominal Per Capita Income
The focus has been on nominal price changes because so much of the groundwork starts

with getting the nominal prices right. Other prices and incomes were not standing still during
these periods; therefore, we show changes in housing prices relative to all prices by deflating by
the CPI. In addition, we examine the affordability of housing by dividing the indices by an index
for nominal GDP per capita in the two periods.
The experiences for all prices and nominal incomes were quite different in the 1920-1940
period and the 2000s. The 2000s was a period of mild CPI price inflation of 2.5 percent per year
while nominal GDP per capita grew fast enough that real per capita incomes grew through 2007
before a decline during the recession. Real per capita incomes have nearly caught up to the 2007
level again in 2011. In contrast the 1920s followed the end of a dramatic inflation during World

War I. The CPI fell 20 percent between 1920 and 1922; then the economy went through mild
inflations and deflations through 1929. The Great Contraction was associated with a 25 percent
drop in the CPI from 1929 to 1933. During the rest of the 1930s, there was a mild inflation of
2.7 percent per year from 1933 to 1937, followed by mild deflation from 1937 to 1939.
Meanwhile, per real capita incomes fell sharply in the recession at the beginning of the 1920s,
grew relatively quickly until 1929 and then fell by 30 percent between 1929 and 1933. Real
income per capita did not reach its 1929 level again until 1940.
IX.1 Adjusting for the CPI.
The adjustment for CPI inflation does not change the story of housing prices in the 2000s
much. The rise in relative housing prices from 2000 to 2006/2007 is dampened relative to the
rise in nominal housing prices. For example, real median housing values for the Top 400 cities
rose only 46.9 percent in Table 9 compared with the nominal price rise of 91.6% shown in Table
7. The decline in real housing prices from 2006/2007 to 2010 looks worse. The Median index
for the top 400 cities fell 16.6 percent to 132.9. Meanwhile, the resale price indices adjusted for
CPI inflation and new home sales price indices fell to roughly the same levels they had reached
in 2000.
The wild gyrations in the price level in the 1920s and 1930s cause the housing prices
adjusted for inflation to follow a substantially different path than nominal housing prices did.
Instead of rising to a peak in the mid-1920s and then declining until 1940, as the nominal
housing prices did, the AVOOMS and Median indices adjusted for inflation in Table 10 and
Figure 5 rose roughly 41 percent to a peak in 1928, fell slightly to 1930 and then rose to a new
higher peak in 1933. The real housing prices then declined to a level in 1940 that lay somewhere

between the 1920 and 1922 levels.14 Whatever home owners gained in real value after 1920,
they had largely lost by 1940. The other series all follow a similar pattern of a temporary peak in
the 1920s and then a higher peak around 1931, 1932 or 1933. All but the GBW-Hybrid series
also then experience a decline in real value. In contrast, the GBW-Hybrid series rises to a new
peak in 1940 that is more than 27 percent higher than the 1920 value.
IX.2 Affordability: Housing Prices Relative to Income
The affordability indices shows the ratio of the indices for home prices to indices for
nominal GDP per capita. When the index rises, houses become more expensive relative to
people’s incomes. As with the adjustments for the CPI, scaling housing prices relative to
incomes dampens the growth rate in relative housing prices relative to the growth rate in nominal
housing prices. Nominal Median Housing Values for the top 400 cities rose 91.6 percent, but
they rose only 47 percent faster than incomes rose during the period, as seen in Table 9. Housing
prices than fell relative to incomes afterward so that housing values relative to incomes were
somewhere between the values in 2003 and 2005.

Most studies adjust for inflation by dividing by a measure of the price level, either the Consumer Price Index or
the Implicit Price Deflator used to deflate Gross Domestic Product. The idea is to adjust for changes in the price
level driven by changes in the money supply. This makes perfect sense with a neutral inflation or deflation where
most prices are moving in the same direction. It becomes a trickier question when relative prices are changing
dramatically, as they did in the 1920s and 1930s and again in the 2000s. Rents rose rapidly until 1925 while the
prices of the rest of the goods had fallen sharply between 1920 and 1922. Between 1925 and 1933 rents fell more
than the prices of the rest of the goods and rents stayed substantially lower than prices for the remaining goods for
the rest of the 1930s. However, it turns out that it does not make too much difference to the index when it is
deflated by either the overall CPI or by the nonrent CPI. The magnitudes are different but the same story is told.
The AVOOMS home value index relative to the overall CPI rises from 71.9 in 1920 to 100 in 1930. It then rises to
106.6 because there was severe deflation during the early 1930s before falling to 98.9 and then 87.7. When the
adjustment is relative to the price index for nonrent goods, the rise is from 67.9 in 1920 to 100 in 1930 to 105.5 in
1933 then a decline to 95.9 and 85.9. The median housing value estimates follow a similar path from 68 in 1920 to
100 in 1933 to 72.6 in 1940 relative to the full CPI, and from 64.3 to 100 to 71.1 relative to the nonhousing CPI.
14

In the earlier period every series in the right side of Table 10 and in Figure 6 shows that
housing price rose much faster than incomes between 1920 and 1922. The houses became 23 to
33 percent less affordable in that 2 year span. Incomes grew faster than housing prices until 1929
when nearly all of the indices bottom out around 89 to 93. Then all hell broke loose. Housing
prices fell, but incomes fell much faster. By 1933 the index had risen to over 130 in every
housing value index. From the peak affordability level reached in 1929, houses had become 44
to 50 percent less affordable. For the rest of the decade every series except the Shiller-GBW
hybrid shows a large drop in the index to levels that made housing 11.8 to 30.4 percent more
affordable relative to income than in 1929 and 7 to 20 percent more affordable than in 1920. In
all cases incomes rose much faster than housing prices over the rest of the decade.

Conclusions
The most commonly cited time series for nonfarm home values and prices between 1920

and 1940 was created by Robert Shiller with a goal of showing long run housing prices from
1890 to the present. Shiller relied on a series developed by Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956)
for 1890 to 1934 and then spliced in a new series based on 30 asking prices per year in five
major cities to extend the series from 1934 to 1953. The emphasis on obtaining annual series
that are consist over the long run caused the scholars to avoid using information from the U.S.
Censuses and other sources to more carefully examine the period from 1920 to 1940. In this
paper we develop a new version of the Grebler, Blank, and Winnick series for 1920 to 1934 that
includes nearly 2.5 times as many cities, as well several alternative measures for changes in
housing prices between 1920 and 1940 that are based on information collected from other

government publications and archival sources. We then use the information to compare and
contrast the changes in housing prices during the boom and bust in housing prices between 1920
and 1940 and the modern day boom and bust in the 2000s.
The new indices and the Shiller-GBW Hybrid Indices all show that nominal housing
prices fell by somewhere between 20 and 30 percent from a peak between 1925 and 1930 to a
low level around 1933 and 1934. However, there is substantial disagreement about the values
circa 1920 and 1940. For 1920 the Shiller-GBW Hybrid suggests that housing values were 4.9
to 7.3 percent higher than they were in 1930, while all the series based on 1920 mortgage Census
information, the rent CPI, average values of residential building permits and Grebler, Blank, and
Winnick’s preferred series adjusted for depreciation show that housing values circa 1920 were
anywhere from 6.5 to 20 percent lower than in 1930.
For 1940 the Shiller-GBW Hybrid index shows that housing prices had returned to within
5 percent of the 1930 value. In contrast, all of the other series have 1940 values that are 18.7 to
35.6 percent lower than in 1930. In summary, the most commonly cited current series suggests
much lower growth rates in nominal housing prices between 1920 and the mid-1920s peak than
all of the other series show and a much stronger recovery after 1933 than any other series. In
fact, several of the series suggest declines from 1933 to 1940 rather than recovery.
Comparisons of the booms and busts in nominal home values show that the growth in
nominal home values between 2000 and 2006/2007 was much more rapid than in the 1920s
boom. Home values fell significantly between 2007 and 2010, but nominal values remained
substantially higher than in 2000. For every housing measure except the current Shiller-GBW
Hybrid the situation in the 1930s will give people pause in the modern era. After housing prices

fell sharply between 1930 and 1933, nominal housing values failed to rebound by 1940 to
anywhere near their 1930 level, nor did they reach their 1920 level. In fact, several series
suggest that housing prices continued to fall until 1940.
When housing values are adjusted for CPI inflation, the growth rate in housing values is
dampened between 2000 and 2006/2007, but it is still substantially larger than the growth in the
1920s boom. The median values reported by all home owners for the top 200 cities grew 59.4
percent between 2000 and 2006, compared with growth rates of 35 to 42 percent for similar
indices in the boom period between 1920 and 1928. The bust from 2007 to 2010 shows strong
declines in median real home values reported by all home owners but leave people with values at
least 30 percent above the values in 2000. The changes in inflation-adjusted home values from
1928 to 1933 look quite different from the sharp declines in nominal home values because of the
30 percent deflation in all prices between 1929 and 1933. Between 1928 and 1933, inflationadjusted home values declined for a couple of years and then rose to a new peak that was higher
than the peak in the 1920s. Between 1933 and 1940 real home prices fell for every series except
the extant GBW-Shiller Hybrid series to levels that were between the levels seen between 1920
and 1922. If by some chance the modern era repeats the pattern in the 1930s, home values may
continue to decline over the next several years.
The affordability of housing was examined by comparing the ratio of home values to per
capita income over time. In the 2000s boom, median housing values reported by all home
owners rose 47 percent faster than income before the index fell back to a level 27 percent above
the 2000 ratio. In the 1920s the sharp recession in 1921-1922 caused incomes to fall while
housing prices were rising, leading to an early peak in 1922 in the ratio. By 1929 home price
affordability had risen sharply, as nominal housing prices started declining after 1925 and per

capita incomes rose. The Great Contraction caused per capita incomes to fall much more quickly
than housing prices fell between 1929 and 1933, and housing became much less affordable. The
situation reversed itself by 1940, causing the ratio of housing prices to incomes to fall below the
ratios in 1920, so that relative to income housing was more affordable than at any time in the
intervening period.

Appendix I
Calculating Medians from the Reported Distributions of Housing Values
The 1940 Census of Housing reported median values for homes in each city for both 1930 and
1940. They also reported distributions of housing values for 1940 and the 1930 Census of Housing
reported both medians and distributions of housing values for 1930. We also calculated medians for
housing values from the distribution in the following way. The most commonly reported categories for
cities in the 1930 and 1940 census and in the housing inventories were values from $1-$999, $1000$1499, $1500-$1999, $2000-$2499, $2500-$2999, $3000-$3999, $4000-$4999, $5000-$7499, $7500$9999, and $10000 and over. The 1930 census also included categories for $10,000-$14999, $15000$19999 and $20000 and over. 67 of 960 cities with information in 1930 had medians higher than
$10,000, but the census reported those medians. By 1940 only 13 of 956 cities had median housing
values higher than $10,000. When we calculated the medians from the distribution information, we
followed a procedure similar to the following procedure. Create the cumulative distribution for the
categories, pick the category in which the cumulative percentage (CPH) is higher than 50 with a top
income of YH and the cumulative percentage of the next lower category (CPL) is less than 50 with a top
income of YL. The formula used to calculate the median is (50-CPL)/(CPH-CPL)*(YH-YL). For
example, if 46 percent of the homes were valued at $2999 or less and 53 percent were values at $3999 or
less, the median is calculated as (50-46)/(53-46)*(3999-2999).
The housing inventories for 1934, 1935, and 1936 from the property inventories and the financial
survey of housing in 1934 did not report median or average values, although they did report distributional
information. We used the same formula for the median as described above. The categories used in the
1934 Financial Survey of Housing for 65 cities were $1-$999, $1000-$1499, $1500-$1999, $2000-$2999,
$3000-$3999, $4000-$4999, $5000-$7499, $7500-$9999, $10000-$14999, $15000-$19999; and $20,000
and over. The only difference was the lack of a split at $2500 within the $2000-$2999 category.
Another 31 city inventories in 1934 reported information for $1-$999, $1000-$1499, $1500-$1999,
$2000-$4999, $5000-$9999, $10000-$19999; and $20,000 and over. The estimates of the medians for
these cities are therefore subject to more measurement error.
The categories for the 1935 inventories were the same as for 1930 for 11 of the 49 cities except
the category for $1000-$2000 was not split at the $1500 value. The remaining 38 cities had the same
categories as in 1930 except that the values from $5,000 to $10,000 were split into $5000-$5999, $6000$7999 and $8000-$9999. These same categories were also used in city inventories for 41 cities in 1936.

Appendix II
Comparability of the Surveys in 1930, 1940, and the 2000s.
The IPUMS description of how housing values were reported in the original census manuscripts
for 1930 and 1940 say that “enumerators consulted with the owners to estimate the sale value of the
housing unit. For single-family, non-farm houses, the estimate included the value of the house and
land….For owner-occupied units that were part of a building containing other households or businesses
(except a small room used by the owner for an office), the estimate included only the value of the part of

the house in which the owner's household lived. For example, if the owning household of a two-family
house rented half of the house to another household, only half of the house's value would have been
reported….” This information was downloaded from IPUMS USA website http://usa.ipums.org/usaaction/variables/VALUEH#comparability_tab on April 17, 2012.
For the 2000 census and the American Community Surveys of 2003 and 2005-2010, “respondents
estimated the full current market value of the property, including both house and land, even if the
respondents owned only part of the property.” “Apart from group quarters, all owner-occupied or vacantfor-sale units were covered, including mobile homes, condominiums, units with offices or businesses
attached, and houses on lots of any size. For mobile homes in pre-2008 ACS…data, the value of the land
was included in the value; in the 2008 ACS…land value was included only if the owner of the mobile
home also owned the land.” Downloaded from IPUMS USA website http://usa.ipums.org/usaaction/variables/VALUEH#comparability_tab on April 17, 2012.

Sources: AVOOM stands for average value of mortgaged owner-occupied homes. The 1F refers to one-family homes. The index uses
only cities with information in all three sources. The average values of mortgaged owner-occupied homes were reported for 1920 in U.S. Bureau
of the Census (1923, 18,173-8) and for 1930 in hand written tables from U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce (undated). The average

values of mortgaged one-family owner-occupied homes were reported for 1930, 1933, and 1934 in Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (undated)
and for 1940 in (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1943, Volume IV, Part 1, p. 80, 88-9). The Shiller-GBW Hybrid adjusted for inflation is graphed in
Shiller (2005, 36) and was downloaded from http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm on April 24, 2012. From 1920 through 1934 it is the
same as the Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (GBW) unadjusted index. The GBW adjusted and unadjusted indices are from Grebler, Blank, and
Winnick (1956, 342-356) and are reported as series Dc826 and Dc827 in Snowden (2006, 4-515).

Source: Information on median values for each city in 1930 and 1940 comes from U.S. Bureau of Census (1943, Volume II, Parts 1-5, Table 24 for
each state). Information on median values was calculated from distributional information reported in Wickens (1937), U.S. Bureau of Foreign
and Domestic Commerce (undated), and Works Progress Administration and Stapp, Peyton (1938). Weighted means and standard
deviations use the number of families owning and occupying nonfarm homes who reported home values in the city in 1930 from the U.S. Bureau
of the Census (1933, pp. 60, 73-81 and Tables 7, 21, and 23 for each state).

Sources: Median Sale Values Reported by All Home Owners created indices for medians within each city over the years with year 2000 values
=100 and then aggregated across cities with averages weighted by the number of home owners reporting values in the year 2000. The data
come from microdata samples from the 2000 Census and 2003-2010 American Community Surveys downloaded from Ruggles, et. al. (2010) at
www.ipums.org. The S&P/Case-Shiller Repeat Sales Price was downloaded from http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shillerhome-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=spusa-cashpidff--p-us---- on April 24, 2012 and the monthly data were averaged for each year. The OFHEO
