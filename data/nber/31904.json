    "abstract": "\n\nIn over-the-counter (OTC) markets, customers must find a counterparty to trade. Little is known about this process, however, because existing data is comprised of transaction records, which are only informative about the end of a search. Leveraging data from the leading trading platform for corporate bonds, we study the search process: we analyze customers\u2019 repeated attempts to trade (successful and unsuccessful). We estimate that it takes two to three days to complete a transaction after an unsuccessful attempt, with substantial variation across trade and customer characteristics. Our analysis offers insights into the sources of trading delays in OTC markets.\n\n",
