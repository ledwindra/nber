February, 1980

The Evolution of the American Labor Market, 1948-1980

ABSTRACT

The United States' Labor Market has experienced significant changes
in the composition of the work force, the type of work performed, the
institutional rules of operation and the structure of wages, employment,
and unemployment since World War II.

Some of these changes continue historic

trends while others have diverged from developments in earlier decades.

This

paper identifies seven of the most important changes, documents their
magnitude, and seeks to estimate their impact on the economy.
The seven changes are:

1. a decrease in the rate of growth of real

wages and labor productivity; 2. a change in the age, sex, and education
composition of the work force; 3. a significant change in the composition
of labor demand and employment; 4. a decline in the proportion of workers
in trade unions; 5. changes in operations rules and procedures of firms
and unions; 6. the altered structure of wages; and 7. changes in the rate
and composition of unemployment and its relation to wage inflation.

Since World War II, the labor market in the United States has experienced
significant changes in the composition of the work force, type of work performed,
institutional rules of operation and structure of wages, employment and unemployment.

Some of the changes continue historic trends.

Others. however, have

diverged from developments of earlier decades to create new labor market conditions and problems.

In this paper, I identify seven of the most important

changes, document their magnitude, and seek to estimate their impact on the
economy.
(1)

The

s~ven

changes are:

A decreasing rate of growth of real wages and labor productivity.
For the first time in recent American economic history, the real
(constant dollar) pay and average output per worker have failed to
increase substantially over an extended period of time.
1966, real earnings increased by 2.1% per annum.

From 1900 to

From 1966 to 1978,

real compensation per manhour increased by jUdt 1.7% per annum.

Output

per worker grew by 2.4% from 1900 to 1966, compared to just 1.8% from
1966 to 1978.

Slackened growth of real earnings and productivity in

the 1970s represent one of the major changes in the United States' labor

(2)

market.
A changed 1se; sex, and education composition of the work force.
Continuing historic trends, the percentage of the work force that is
female, and the percentage with high school and college training have iocreased, while the labor participatioorate of older men has declined.

The

age structure of the work force was also altered as a result of the post
World War II "baby boom".

These de!:1ographic changes make the typical worker

io the latter part of the 20th century different from the typical worker in
earlier decades and have led to different market problems.
(3)

A significant change in the composition of labor demand and employment.
Continuing long-term historic .trends, the fraction of workers employed in

/

-2white collar occupations, in government, and in the service industries
increased in the period under study, while the fraction working as factory
operatives or laborers, and in agriculture declined.

In Dore detailed

sectors, there were also marked changes in the composition of employment,
with the number of workers in some industries (i.e., coal) decreasing in
early postwar years and then increasing in the latter years, while the converse occurred in other industries (i.e., education).

In a strikingly new

development, the growth of demand for educated wQrkers fell short of the
growth of supply, with the result that the quality of jobs obtained by the
educated declined.

The sizeable changes in employment by industry and

occupation highlight the flexibility of the work force in response to .
dynamic changes in demand for labor in a modern economy.
(4)

A declining proportion of workers in trade unions
In 1954, 35% of nonagricultural workers in the U.S. were in trade
in 1974, only 26% were so organized -organizati~n

in the 1920s.

in the extent of union

of comparable magnitude to the decline in percentage organized
The decline in the proportion organized is the resultant of

two divergent trends:

a steep fall in the proportion of private wage and

salary workers who are organized, even in traditional union strongholds;
contrasted with a sharp rise in the proportion of public sector workers
who are organized.

Thus, unionism has become less prevalent and qualitatively

different than in the immediate post-World War II period.
(5)

Changes in the rules and procedures of operation of firms and unions.
Three important sets of forces have fundamentally altered the way in which
companies hire, fire, promote, and otherwise treat workers:

equal oppor-

tunity and affirmative action legislation by the federal government; other
federal laws such as in occupational health and safety; and the advent of
computerized personnel files.
practices of

These forces have transformed the personnel

companies to an· extent unprecedented since the onset of the

-3scientific management movement of the l890-l920s.

They have had a particularl}

significant effect on the way enterprises treat minority and women workers.
(6)

An altered structure of wages.
Differentials in wages by race, age, educati?n, and occupation have undergone fundamental changes in the period.

The wages of young workers have

fallen relative to the wages of older workers.
to whites.

Blacks have gained relative

The composition of the wage package has also altered, with

becoming an increasingly large share of labor cost.

Sizeable

medium term changes in the differentials paid different groups of workers
highlight the flexibility of wage structures.

Changes in the rate and composition of unemployment and its relation to
wage inflation.
The average rate of unemployment in the United States drifted upward in the
period under study.

In the 1950s, unemployment averaged 4.5%; in the 19705,

The fraction of the unemployed who are young workers, particularly

young minority workers, has risen noticeably as has the fraction in
high skill groups.

The rate of change in money wages coincident with

given levels of unemployment rose over the period, destroying the once
widely held belief in the existence of a stable Phillipps curve linking
wage inflation to unemployoent.
Plan of Study
What are the quantitative dimensions of the seven changes sketched out
above?
To what extent do the changes represent continuance of past labor market
developments or fundamentally new patterns of change?
What caused the seven major changes?
The paper seeks to answer these questions.

First it analyzes the magnitude

of each of the seven changes and the extent to which they represent a continuation

Change (1):

Growth of Real Earnings and Labor

Perhaps the most distrubing

Productivi~

post-\~or1d

War II trend in the American

labor market has been the notable retardation in the growth of real wages
and output per manhour that began in the late 1960s.

As Table 1 shows, long-

term increases in real compensation per manhour on the order of 2.1% per annum,
which had risen in the 1947 to 1966 period, declined to just 1.7% from
1966 to 1978.

The rate of growth of real average hourly earnings (which exclude

fringe benefits and are thus a less desireable measure of earnings, but which
is

widely used in analyses) fell from 2.4% (1947 to 1966) to just 0.8% (1966

to 1978).

Concomitant with the decline in real earnings was a sharp fall in

the growth of output per manhour.
Is the retardation in the growth of real earnings and productivity
the result of sectoral shifts in the economy, such as the reduced flow of
workers out of agriculture or the shift into services?

Analysis by the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that 22% of the reduction in growth from
1947-1966 to 1967-1978 can be attributed to sectoral shifts,
short of accounting for the bulk of the retardation.

1/

which falls far

That sectoral changes

are not the prime force at work is documented by the fact that productivity
growth has decreased in most industries: in 47 of the 62 industries for which
the B.L.S. calculates productivity, rates of change in output per employee hour
~ere

lower from 1966 to 1976 than from 1947 to 1966.

Similarly, while rates of

change in earnings differ for various groups of workers [see the discussion of
Change (6)] only in coal was the rate of increase in real earnings
post-1969 than pre-l969.

higher

The seventies's retardation is not the result of

the changing industrial mix of the economy.

sluggish state or the economy in the 1970s.

Regression analyses of the log of real

on a trend variable, a 1970 trend, and a rnea-

sure of business cycle, the level of unemployment, yield significant negative 1970
trend coefficients.

Comparable regressions using a first difference format and
3/
using different trend breaks yield similar results.Accepting the retardation of growth as real, what factors can be
adduced to explain the pattern of change?
A

~~jor

effect to account for the 1950s slowdown has been made by

Denison, who has used standard growth accounting methods to attribute the
decline in productivity to selected factors.

Table 2 presents the results of his

analysis for the period 1948-1973 and 1973-1976.

While Denison's period.is shorter

than that in Table 1, suffers from reflecting cyclical (the 1974-1975 recession)
as well as secular patterns and other problems, his estimates offer the best
available evaluation of the magnitude of factors at work.
With respect to labor inputs, Denison finds little impact of changes in
workers' hours and attributes to the decelerated growth rate: the sizeable increase
in the.educated work force in the period,

~hich

tends to raise growth, is balanced

off by the decrease in labor input due to fewer hours worked and the changing
age-sex composition of employment.

Extending these calculations over a longer

period of time is unlikely to greatly alter the results [see Change (2)].
With respect to the other major input, capital, Denison's calculations
suggest only a modest role to slower capital formation per person in the retardation.

From 1948 to 1973 Denison finds a growth of capital and per person

employed of .35 points, compared to .24 points from 1973 to 1976, a modest retardation of .11 points compared to the decline in productivity of 2.97 points.

Using

different data, Mark obtains an even stronger result as he finds that "the capitallabor ratio grew at about the same rate from 1966 to 1976 as it did from 1947 to
1966" (p. 198), eliminating it as an explanatory factor.

-7Three other possibilities for explaining the retardation deserve
attention.
output.

First is the decline in expenditures on R&D relative to national

Hhile the drop in R&D may have complex effects on the economy, estimates

of its contribution to the retardation of growth using standard growth accounting
suggest only a modest impact (Denison, Griliches).
Second is what Denison calls "changes in the legal and human environment," due in large measure to governmental regulation [see Change (6)].

While

there is general agreement that regulations have reduced measured productivity,
estimates of their magnitude are difficult to obtain.

Those of Denison indicate

that costs incurred to protect the physical environment and health and safety of
workers may explain as much as 13% of the retardation (-.40/-2.97).
The third, and most controversial factor, is the rise in energy prices.
Some analysts place great weight on the increase in energy prices and resultant
decline in energy used in their analyses of productivity (Jorgenson & Hudson).

The

fact that the timing of the drop in productivity and real wages was concentrated
after 1973, which is roughly coincident with the rise in oil prices due to.OPEC,
tends to support this interpretation.

On" the other' hand, other analysts (Perry,

Denison, Bruno & Sachs) attribute a smaller impact to the rise in energy prices,
largely because energy use has not declined dramatically and does not constitute
a large share of national product.
As Table 2 shows, the bottom line in Denison's calculations for productivity growth in the 1970s, like those for earlier times, leaves the final explanation open to question, for the key factor is changes in the residual "advances
in knowledge and miscellaneous determinants", which dropped from positive 1.41 to
negative -.75 in the period covered.

In sum, while there is general agreement

that there was a marked break in trend in productivity and real wage growth in
the period covered, the cause and possible long-term persistence of the change
remain open to question.
Is the retardation a phenomenon unique to the United States in the

Table 3 presents evidence on the growth of productivity and real wages
in several developed countries and in the United States which suggest that the
retardation has characterized most of the developed countries, and is thus more
likely due to worldwide economic trends than to developments specific to the
United States.
What stands out in Table 3 is the fact that both before and after the
period of retardation, the growth rate of the United States was exceedingly dismal:
worse than that of every country save the United Kingdom.

Change (2):

The Composition of the Work Force

In 1978, there were over 103 million persons aged 16 and over in the U.S.
work force, of whom 94.4 million were in the civilian work force.

Forty-one

percent of the work force were women; nearly half were less than 35 years of age;
and about one-fourth were between 16 and 24; approximately one in three had
attended college for at least one year and one in six was a college graduate;
over 70% were high school graduates; and about lOr. may have been illegal

!!-/
aliens.
Thirty years earlier, the composition of the labor force was quite different, with relatively fewer women, young persons, and highly educated workers.
The labor force participation rate of married women with spouse present more than
doubled over the period, and the proportion of married.wbmen in the labor force
with children under six nearly tripled.

TDe participation of men, by contrast,

fell, especially those in the 55 to 64 age bracket and non-white.

In the span

of only three decades, the work force had chaneed to a remarkable extent (see
figure 1).
The most important change was the influx of wor-en into the job market,
particularly of married women with children.

In the early part of the post-

World War II period, most of the increase occurred among older women, many of
whom were returning to work as their children reached school age.

Nearly

80% of the growth in the female workforce between 1947 and 1965 resulted
from increased numbers of women aged 35 and over, whose labor force participation
rate rose sharply.

By contrast, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the major

source of growth of the female work force was among younger women, with
of the increase coming from persons less than 35 years old.

77~

From 1965 to 1977,

the participation rate of women aged 20 to 24 rose from 50% to 677..while that of

Jj
women aged 25 to 34 rose from 39% to 60%.

The proportion of workers under 35 years of age jumped from

35% to 50% in the span of only one decade.

As the proportion of the young

going on to higher education increased in the period, much of the
growth in the labor force of younger workers occurred among the college-trained.
In 1966, there were 0.49 male college graduates aged 25 .to 34 per gradua te 35
10/
years of age and over; by 1976 the ratio had jumped to 0.78.-The large size of the youth population has had several socio-economic
consequences.

It has, as will be seen later, altered the earnings of younger

relative to older workers and made youth unemployment a oajor national concern.
Coupled with 19605 increases in the proportion of young choosing to go on to

-14college, the increased number of youths sparked a large expansion of the education sector and a IIgolden age ll for colleges and universities.

Because crime is

an activity disproportionately conducted by the young, it also raised rates of
criminal activity (see Freeoan and Hedoff, 1980).
Despite the extraordinary increase in the number of young persons and
growth in their labor participation rate, youth unemployment did not rise drarnatically in the period studied.

Among white youth aged 16 to 19 the number em-

played rose from 4.1 million in 1964 to 7.0 million in 1977 as the proportion
employed actually increased.

Among minority youth, however, the proportion in

the labor force and the proportion employed fell while the proportion unemployed
rose.

The differential

employment prospects facing white and black youth" became

11/
one of the major problemG of the decade.

.

One of the most surprising labor force changes shown in figure 1 is the
marked drop in the participation of adult males, particularly older men and
non-white men.

In 1954, 86% of men 16 and over were in the work force; in 1977,

79%.

Aoong non-whites the decline was even more precipitous, from 85% in 1954 to

71%.

The downward trend in non-white male participation is the major discordent

pattern in a period of broad non-white economic advance.

Both among whites and

non-whites the drop in participation was concentrated among older men, with the
participation of all 55 to 64 year old men falling by 16 percentage points.
The principal qualitative chanBe in the labor force in post-Uorld
War II years was the increased educational attainment of workers.

In contrast to

high school graduation became common among the

young, while a substantial fraction of young men and women chose to go on to college
during the 19605.

Between 1954 and 1969, the proportion of 18 to 19 year old men
\

going to college rose from .30 to .44 while the proportion of 18 to 19 year old
women going to college increased from .23 to .36.

As a result of increased

The proportion of 18 to 19 year old men in college dropped

to just 34% by 1974; whereas in 1969 there were 0.5 graduate level enrollees
per college graduate aged 22 to 29, in 1975, there were 0.4 enrollees per bachelor's
graduate in the 22 to 29 year old age bracket.

In some Ph.D. specialties, enroll-

ments and degrees granted fell by as much as 40%.

Causes of Change
The economic model of labor supply, in which supply decisions reflect
economic incentives, can be used to analyze changes in female participation, male
participation, and educational investments.
In the siDple economic

model, changes in labor force participation are

due to changes in narket wages and in the value of tiDe spent working at" horne
(the 'shadow wage' for household activities).

Increases in market wages

~ill

raise

labor participation (substitution effect), while increases in the value of working
at horne, due to higher income of other household members, will reduce participation
(incol!le effect).
Improve=ents in household technology, which take the form either of

-16-

new machines or

tec~.niques

or of lower prices for given techniques, can

increase or decrease work activity depending on the extent to which they substitute for household time, among other things.
The basic effort to explain participation rate patterns follows
a two-stage procedure.

First, the effects of the

~~ges

of women and of their

husbands on participation are estimated by cross-sectional (more recently, longitudinal) data.

Then the changes in these explanatory factors over time are

multiplied by their estiMated effects to assess the impact of the changes on
participation.

Because the wages of men and of WOMen have risen at roughly

the same rate over tiQe, the model requires greater female responsiveness to
female wages than to the incomes of their husbands to account for the upward
trends in participation.
to their

ow~

\{hile most studies have found that women react more

wages than to their husbands' earnings, the differences have not

_13/
been sufficiently large to explain the bulk of increased female participation.
Addition of other factors, such as number of children, does not greatly enhance
the ability to track the trend.

Perhaps most discouragingly, the most recent

results for the 1970 Census of Population show that the economic factors "which
together once explained three-quarters of the variation in wives' participation
rates across SHSAs (Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas) now account for
only one-third of it.

of women in terQS of simple economic factors.
One possible missing element from standard Qodels is the nature of household technology.

The household sector is surprisingly capital intensive.

In 1975,

the average household had $6,900 in consumer durables. From 1952 to 1975, the
15/
accumulation of durables increased by 5.4% per annum.-Refrigerators, washing
machincs, and related equipMcnt became increasinr.ly prevalent in the

cannot be readily disentangled, the growth of fast

and other restaurants have come to offer a more readily available

(and chosen) alternative for one of the main household products.

In the absence

of estimates of the quantitative effect of these factors (and of the substitution
between time and goods in household production), however, we can do no more than
speculate about the effect of technology in "freeing" ·women's time.
Another possible missing element, which must be brought into the
story with care, is attitudinal changes, potentially associated with the
women's liberation movement

~f

the late sixties and seventies.

That there ·toJere

significant changes in attitudes over the period is apparent from diverse
opinion surveys.

As late as 1967,

44:~

of first-year college women and

67% of first-year college men thought "a woman's pl,ace is best at home."
In 1974, only 19% of entering college women and 40% of entering college men agreed
};if
with that view. Clearly, it had become (for whatever reason) more socially
. acceptable for women to devote themselves to careers as opposed to marriage and
family.

The extent to which these changes in attitudes were caused by or

caused the labor force patterns is difficult to determine.
The basic economic model can also be used to analyze the decline in
the labor participation of older men.

One important economic factor that can

be expected to reduce participation of men 65 and over has been the expansion
of social security coverage, which places a higher tax on earnings after that
age.
Another fat tor likely to lower older male participation is private
pension plans, which have also become more widespread in recent years (Skolnik)
and which typically provide strong incentives to leave the job, often in the
form of mandatory retirement.

Indeed, mandatory retirement provisions are

sufficiently widespread as to constitute a major institutional provision in
labor contracts (Lazear).

Recent changes in the law regarding vesting of

-18pensions and mandatory retire~ent [see Change (6)] may provide an ioportant
"test" of how private pensions and mandatory retirement rules in fact affect
retirement decisions.
Host empirical studies find sizeable response parameters to economic
variables in retirement behavior, with older men estimated to be Dare sensitive
to wages or nor:..age income than men in general (Cain & \o:atts, 1973).

Although

detailed analysis of the effect of social security on retirement is just beginning, the evidence seems to support the attribution of a considerable effect
to the social security mode of retirement pay (Baskin & Hurd, Boskin. Burkhauser
and Turner, Pellechio, Quinn). Recent analysis of the work incentive effects
of social security -- the strong dependence of benefits on final years' pay,
which can increase participation -- does, however, raise some doubts about its impact
(Blinder, Gordon & Wise).
The puzzling drop :.0 the labor force participation of black men has
been explained in part by another component of Social.Security:
Insurance (SSDI).

Disability

About half of older black men out of the labor force are

recipients of SSDI.

Because of their concentration in blue-collar jobs with

substantial risk of job-related injuries and lower wage rates. black nen turn out
to have been more affected by

~he

program than white men (Leonard).

Still, a

significant proportion of their decline in participation remains unexplained.
Finally. the

h~~an-capital

analysis of investment in skills provides a

reasonably successful explanation of the changes in the qualifications of the
work force.

In the human-capital model, decisions to obtain a certain level

of schooling or skill are made by comparing tW6 income streams:

the stream

tllat results from the investment and the stream that would obtain in its absence.
If. at a given interest rate r, the present value of the former exceeds the
latter plus the direct cost of the investment, the individual is expected to
choose the investnent.

Because about two-thirds of the private cost of educa-

-19~

cation turns out to consist of foregone income, as opposed to direct costs,
the analysis directs attention to differences in the wages of more and less
qualified persons as the major factor in investcents in schooling.
Analyses of the link between enrollment patterns suggest that cuch of
the postwar expansion and the seventies' contraction

~n

the higher educati9D sys-

teQ can be attributed to changes in economic incentives, measured by wages
or other indicators of rates of return.

The growth of enrollments in the

1960s was spurred by improved earnings opportunities for college graduates while
the decline of enrollments in the 1970s appears to be the result of the falling
return to college workers [see Change (5)].

Cross-section

(Ro~en

and Willis)

and time series (Freeman,1975) analyses find sufficiently high elasticities of
response as to account for the bulk of the changes in male enrollments in terms
of the economic model.

The slow-down in doctorate production also appears

explicable in terms of the economic factors at work in that market, although,
in this case, nonprice factors, notably the difficulty of obtaining academic
employment, may be as important as wages in causing changes (Freeman, 1980a).
Finally, the selection of particular fields of study has also been found to
respond to market factors with, for example, relatively many students choosing
education in the 1960s when the school system was expanding and few choosing
this concentration in the 1970s when the teacher's job carket deteriorated
(Hebl).

Though by no means without problems, the economic analysis does appear

to provide a good handle on the changing educational attainment of the work
force.
Overall,if one single conclusion about the labor force is to be
drawn from the post-World

t~ar

II experience, it is that the labor supply

undergoes substantial dynamic shifts and evinces high supply responsiveness
in several dimensions and thus cannot be

Change (3):

Demand and Employoent

Figure 2 highlights some of the most signjficant changes in the composition of employment in the post-Horld Uar II period.

With respect to occupa-

tions it shows a nassive shift in employment from blue-collar work, including
agricultural, to white-collar work, particularly into professional, technical
and clerical jobs.

Note, however, that the rate of expansion of the white-

collar sector levels off noticeably in the 19705.

Between 1950 and 1960 the

proportion in white-collar jobs increased by 4 percentage points; between 1960
and 1970, the increase is by 7 points, whereas from 1970 to 1978 it is just
3 points.

Among professionals the slackened rate of increase in the 1970s

is even more striking:

after increasing by 3 points between 1950 and 1960 and

by 4 points between 1960 and 1970, the professional share of employment was virtually unchanged between 1970 and 1978.
The slowdown in the growth of professional and white-collar employment at
a time when the number of college graduates is increasing rapidly caused a
&Jajor "underemployment" problem in the college job market.

As Table 4 shows,

there was a substantial downgrading in the types of jobs held by graduates,
with fewer holding professional and technical positions and more in b1uecollar and lower level white-collar jobs.

The modest increase in the propor-

tion of male graduates in managerial positions and the sizeable increase in
the proportion of women in those jobs is, it should be stressed, dwarfed by
the decline in the proportion in technical and professional jobs.

The Bureau

of Labor Statistics predicts that in the next decade or so the demand for
professionals will continue to exPand more slowly than supply, creating an
even greater underemployment problem.
The reduction in the quality of jobs and in the relative earnings of
the more highly educated might expect a drop in the job satisfaction of more
highly educated workers, and, according to the University of Michigan Quality

general agreement as to the best mode of dealing with public sector industira1
relations problens.
Another widely heralded shift in employment, shown in figure 2, is the
relative decline of employment in the Eastern and Midwestern industrial belt.
The fastest gro\.ing regions of the country were "the South, Southwest, and, to a
lesser extent, the West Coast.

r~ny

industries moved into the South and South-

west in this period, locating new plants in such states as Texas, Louisianna,
Florida, Arizona, and Colorado.

Industrialization of those areas and loss of

employment in New England and the Midwest became a subject of considerable
controversy, due to, in part, the federal government's alle&ed spending
decisions which favored the Sun Belt over the Snow Belt.
The shifts in jobs among occupations, .industries, and areas are the
tip of an iceberg of changes in employment in the job market.

Among dis-

aggregated categories there were large changes in employment, with some groups
growing rapidly and others declining and with the grow.th sectors of one decade
often being the declining sectors of the next and vice versus.

School teaching,

for example, was a booming occupation in the 19605, but not in the 1970s.
Employment in aircraft and parts rose by 184% from 1950 to 1969 and then fell
by 42% from 1969 to 1977.

Employment in all mining dropped from 901,000 in
19/
1950 to 619,000 in 1969 and then shot up to 837,000 in 1978.-It is important to recognize that the changes in the composition of
eoployment are more extensive than the changes in the structure of wages.

The standard deviation of log changes in employment in three-digit Census of
Population occupations from 1960 to 1970 was .39 compared to a standard deviation in the log changes of earnings in those occupations of .13.

Similarly,

the standard deviations in log changes in employment among two-digit manufacturing industries far exceed those in wages.

From 1961 to 1977 (which hav.e

roughly similar cyclical conditions) the standard deviation on log changes in
production worker employment in 20 two-digit durable and non-durable industries

-25\.;as . 25,

'~'hi1e

the standard de:viation in the log changes of average hourly

J:Q/
earnings, exclusive of overtime, was .09.

.

One of the fundamental features of the United ·States' economy appears
to be much greater variability in employment by sector than in earn{ngs by
sector.

Though the

~age

structure changes over time, it has greater stability

than employment.

The principal cause of the structural change in employment among occupations 'and industries appears to be dynamic shifts in demanc:LJor labor,
alters enployrnent along relatively elastic supply schedules.

which

While there are

other possible explanations for the concordance of large changes in employment
with more modest changes in wages, the demand/elastic supply interpretation
of the patterns appears to offer the best explanation of the observed phenomenon
(Free:;Jan, 1980b).

Some or the shifts in deraand are attributable to broad

economic swings, such as growth of demand for some goods rather than others,
while others are attributable to technological changes.

Employment and Productivitx
Considerable concern has often been expressed about the effect of
technological change on the level of employment in industry.

Does el:lp10ynent

increase or decrease in industries undergoing significant technological
progress?

The impact of differential increases in productivity and industry

of enployrnent is twofold.

All else being the same, industries with large in-

creases in productivity will experience relative declines in emp10ynent since
fewer workers are needed for production.

But all else will not remain the same.

An industry with substantial gains in labor productivity will find that labor
costs per unit of output and total costs decline rapidly.

The decline in cost

causes prices to fall and induces consumers to purchase more of the industry's

-26output.

Hence, the decline in labor demand associated with the need for fewer

workers per unit of output

~ay

be offset by the increased demand for output.

Empirical evidence for the United States in the postwar period indicates
that the

employ~ent

creating effect of the growth of output are roughly offset

by the disemployment effect of rapid productivity gains.

Specifically, the

correlation between changes in output per employee hour and employee hours in
the industries for which the B.L.S. calculates productivity indexes is a bare
21/
-.03:--Thus, rapid productivity is essentially unrelated to growth of employment
by sector.

Technological change alters the distribution of

industries and occupations, but does not have the feared

emp1o~ent

among

effect of creating

significant loss of jobs in sectors with rapid productivity growth.
Change (4):

Unionism

Collective organization of the U.S. labor force has changed substantially
in the postwar period.

Since the mid-1950s, the fraction of private sector workers

who are unionized has fallen gradually while, by contrast, organization of public
sector workers has jumped en~rmously.

These two changes have altered the labor

movement in the country and the operation.of the labor market.
The two divergent patterns and their net impact on unionization in the
country are depicted in figure 3, which records the fraction organized in the
private and public sectors and in the country overall.

In 1956 the Bureau of

Labor Statistics data showed 34% of private nonagricultural workers to be organized; by 1974, the fraction had dropped to 26%.

In the public sector organization

grew from 12% in 1956 to 19% in 1974, reaching 34% if members of associations,
like the National Education Association,are included as union members.

Because

the majority of workers are private employees, the overall percentage has also fallen.
Data on the success of unions in National Labor Relations Board representative elections tell a similar story about the diminution of private sector
unionism in the United States.

In 1950 unions won 74% of NLRB elections; in 1976

their victory rate was below 50%.

The fraction of eligible-to-vote workers in

election:; won by unions fell even more sharply as unions had increasing difficulty

Barely a third of workers in elections

As a result, the ratio of workers organized

due to the NLRB elections to the total nonagricultural private work force fell

E:./
from 1.7% in 1950 to a bare 0.3% in 1977.
While trade unions have contracted in earlier time periods -- notably
the 19205 when the percentage of nonagricultural workers organized fell
from 20% to 12% -- the drop in the 19505 to 19705 represents a sharp break with
the long-term trend and a pattern in carked contrast to the growth or stability
of unionism in other developed countries, including Canada, where many of the same
unions and firms operate.
\Vhat explains the erosion of private sector organization of the United
States' labor force?

One important factor has been the demographic and employment

changes in the composition of the work force.

The proportion of workers who have

historically tended to be less organized -- women, the young, Southwestern workers,
white-collar workers, and so on -- have grown while the proportion in the traditionally organized categories have fallen.

Esti.cates by Freeman and Hedoff suggest

that about 60% of the decline in unionism can be explained by such structural
23/
changes (Table 4, p. 24).-Still, even among blue-collar workers in traditional
strongholds of unionism, there was a sizeable drop in union coverage:

These figures are merely illustrative as the concepts and sources

-29A second major factor underlying the erosion of unionism among private
wage and salary workers has been increased managerial opposition, abetted in part
by changes in the law.

In the early years of the Wagner Act, employers were

severely limited in what they could say or do to oppose unionism. Since the
late 1940s, however, legal enactment (Section 8C) of Taft-Hartley and diverse
NLRB and Supreme Court decisions regarding managemeni: right to "free speech"
in opposition to unionism has significantly altered the nature of the election
process.

Nowadays, managements contest elections, ffiakin8 extensive eiforts to con-

vince workers to vote against union, and often enp10ying specialized labor
consultants to advise or run their campaigns.

~anagement

In Canada, where the same unions

and management often deal with one another but where the method of recognizing
unions does not allow for management campaigns against organization, trade union
organization of the work force has grown.
Quantitative data from the AFL-CIO and National Industrial Conference
Board suggest that active management opposition has significant effects on the
success of unions.

According to the AFL-CIO study, unions won 97% of elections

with no opposition compared to 30% to 40% °in which management opposition was
extensive.

According to the NIGB study, unions won 85% of elections in which

companies made either no effort or a limited effort in the form of a written
.letter opposing organization; won 51% in which the company held anti-union
meetings, but won only 34% of elections in which written communication, group
and individual meetings were used to communicate.

w~i1e

these studies suffer

from potential simu1taneous·problems due to the: possibility that management
does not fight when the outcome isa foregone conclusion in the union's favor,
both union and management officials place great stress on the impact of
opposition, particularly use of expert labor/management consulting firms.
In addition to legal opposition, however, there has been a marked increase in illegal opposition to unions.

Gallup Polls

This drop in public approval for unions has occurred within broad occupational
categories (professional and business, white-collar, blue-collar, and faroers).
According to Gallup, it has dropped oost rapidly in the past decade among
adults under 30.
Even with changing attitudes, however, a relatively large fraction of
nonunion workers would like to be unionized.
Quality of Enployment Survey

Kochan found that in the 1977

39% of blue-collar workers would vote for

union representation in their workplace, if an election were held,
while 28% of white-collar workers, excluding the self-employed and managers,
would also vote for unions.

"Perhaps the most striking finding was that 67%

of all black and other minority workers would vote to unionize"

(Kochan .. p. 25).

While all of these workers could be in pliints where even in the absence of
management campaigns·to discourage organization the 1!Iajority 'of workers would
vote down unions, it is more likely that at least some are in plants that would
be-organized if instillNtional procedures were

Will private sector unionism continue to diminish in the future?

The

reform the labor laws in the United States in such a way as to reduce the ability

As noted earlier,

these distinct characteristics create new industrial relations issues.
What explains the success of unionism in the public sector compared to
the diminution of organization in the private sector?
A good case can be made that the direct cause of union success in the
public sector has been explicit changes in the law regarding public sector
labor relations.

First, states with laws that are more favorable to public

sector collective bargaining have the highest proportion unionized.

Second,

study, it was found that organization of police increased sizeably following passage of

a: law that required localities to meet and confer with unions (Lauer).

Third, at the federal level, President Kennedy's Executive Order 10988 and
ensuing policies toward unionism clearly precipitated the successful organization of federal employees.

While the political and attitudinal changes that

underlie the new laws may be properly viewed as the fundamental causes of the increased public sector unionism, new laws appear to be a necessary condition for
organizational success.
Concomitant with an increase in unionization in the public sector has
been a growth of strikes among public employees, including white-collar workers
like teachers.

In 1956 BLS data show that outside of education there were just

For the education sector, National Center for Education Statistics data

reveal only two teacher work stoppages (involving just 210 people) in 1959 compared to 218 stoppages (involving 182,300 teachers) in 1975 (UCES 1978, Table 4.9,
p. 182).

Despite the illegality of public sector strikes in most states, teachers

and other public sector workers (except for polic,e and firemen) have come to
view the strikes' asa legitimate mode of seeking contract changes.
Most studies of the effects of public sector unionism on the pay of
,public employees have found moderate differences between the wages of public
sector workers in cities that are organized and cities that are not (see Lewin
for a smnnary),

a surprising result in view of widespread concern with

public sector unions and belief that absence of competition for government
functions would create inelastic demands for their services and thus, great
pow'er in bargaining (Wellington & Winter).

One reason for the modest estimated

effect of public sector unions appears to be the extensive "spillover" of ""ages

-34across cities asci result of the extensive r.eliance of local governmerits on
cooparabflitycolTIparisons in wage set ting (Ehr~nb~rg

&

Gol,<is t~in) •

A nonunion

city near a unidncityin the same state is likely to pay wages similar to those
in the union city.

One study has fOUtld that while police in union and nonunion

cities in the same state teceiveroughly similar pay, police in highly unionized
states obtain a considerable advantage over those in less organized states,
suggesting that public sector unionism hasilldeed had sizeable e.conomic con~
sequences that escape detection from city comparisons (Lauer).

Other studie.s

have found that public sector unions have larger effects on fringe benefits .than
on direct pay {Gustman & Segal,Ichniowski, Edwards & Edwards}.

Change (5):

Governmental Regulations

One of the major changes in the labor market·in·post-l\Torld War II years
has been an increased role of governmental regulations in determining market
behavior and outcomes.

In the area of collective

bargaining~

legislative

enactment and NLRB and court decisions have brought internal union affairs
and the bargaining process under greater regulation than ever conceived by the
proponents of the l.;Tagner Act.

In the area of personnel policy, the antibias

and affirmative action ruies of the f~deral government have revolutionized
employee selection, promotion, and remuneration

policies.

In the area of

work place conditions, occupational health and safety acts and enVironmental,
policies have brought governmentalr~l~s and regulations into thewor~ places
of thousands of enterprises.

Compensation has also been affected, both·by

equal pay legislatiori and regulation of pension plans.

Finally, through its

taxation and social welfare programs, the government has altered the rewards
from working and th~;'fl~or b~neithVhfch thds'e who d3.nnot workmayfalJ.

-35Regulation of Collective Bargainins
In the period under study, two major pieces of labor legislation
were enacted by the U.S. Congress.

The Taft-Hartley Act attempted to redress

what was viewed by many as an imbalance in the labor law favoring unions.
The main purpose of the Landrum-Griffin Act was to regulate the internal
affairs of trade unions to guarantee democratic procedures and reduce the
possibilities of corruption.

The laws, interpreted by the National Labor

Relations Board, the Representative of Labor (expressly responsible for the
Landrum-Griffin Act), and the courts have established the method of determining
union representation, modes of bargaining and conflicts, and internal union
practices.
Representation
As noted in Change (4), court rulings and the Taft-Hartley "free speech
provision" have greatly expanded the extent to which employers can campaign
against unions in NLRB elections, making the electoral process more an adversary
procedure than had previously been the case.

In addition, the Taft-Hartley

Act outlawed closed shop clauses, which "made union membership a prerequisite
for a job, and permited states to outlaw the union shop, which required membership after employment.

Evidence suggests that these changes have

contributed to the gradual diminution of private sector unionism.(Frccnan

~nd

Medoff, 1976; Ellwood and Fine) •.

Bargaining Topics and

P~ocedures

The government has also come to play a role in determining the subjects
of collective. bargaining, prescribing mandatory topics about which parties must
bargain (as opposed to permissive topics, about which they can choose not to
discuss), and outlawing other topics.

When the Supreme Court ruled in 1949 that

pensions were a mandatory topic, there was a sharp increase in the proportion of
the wage bill going to pensions in unionized industries.

In the 1964 Fibreboard

Gase (which made contracting out a mandatory bargaining topic under certain con-

-36.Htions) the Supreme Court noted the extent to which the original intent of the
Wagner Act (to get parties into a room to negotiate, but not to affect the substance of the negotiations) had been changed.
"There was a time when one mieht have taken the view that ••• the courts

comple~

legal obligation on the two parties is

'~argaining

In several important decisions, the NLRB and the courts have

outlawed certain forms of bargaining -- such as Boulwarism, (the General Electric
strategy of making its first offer the full and final offer' and engaging in
a tough propaganda program to sell the offer to workers) -- and have sought to
interpret the state of mind called "good faith".

As there are no obligations to

reach an agreement, however, it is unclear what effect the duty to bargain has on

yJ
negotiations.
Weapons of Conflict
The Taft-Hartley Act

outla~ed

certain forms of conflict, making it an

unfair labor practice for unions, as well as managments, to coerce employees,
for instance by masspicketing,to engage in secondary boycotts, and to strike
for jurisdictional purposes.

The Landrum-Griffin Act added "hot cargo" clauses

(in which management agrees to refuse to deal with other enterprises having
labor disputes) to the list of illegal weapons of conflict.
Internal Union Practices
Far-reaching federal controls on the governance of unions were established
by the Landrum-Griffin Act, passed following the sensational HcClellan Committee
hearings on criminal elements in trade unions:
"Here

the electoral procedures in unions

brought under the law; a "bill of rights" was enacted to guarantee normal

1emocratic freedoms to members;

To some extent the extensive anddet:ailedregulatioh of collective

-37bargaining and internal union.democracy may be a necessary concomitant of the use of
government-regulated elections to establish unions.

Once the governnent has set

up a procedure for organizing, next it can reasonably be expected to concern
itself with the process and outcome.
Antibias Regulation of Personnel Policies
No institutional change has transfor~ed the labor market more than
the outlawing of discriminatory employment practices by Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and the requirement that federal contractors engage in
Affirmative Action under Executive Order 11246.

"The world of the personnel manager

was changed drastically as the EEO and the courts have enforced and implemented
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act" (Miner and Miner, p.4).

Hany traditional modes of

recruiting, testing, and selecting workers.were ended by the EEO laws, replaced
by Affirmative Action searches and "fast tracks" to promote women and minorities.
As Table 4 indicates, a whole set of new personnel practices were initiated as a
result of the Equal Employment Opportunity pressures

As the

Bureau of National Affairs puts it:
Equal Employment Opportunity (£EO) Programs complete with
Affirmative Action Plans (AAP) are viewed as 'a fact of
life' by nearly all employers, and the personnel function
has changed in a variety of ways as a' result of the
government's efforts to enforce the employment provisions
of the act (p. 1).
The nuscle behind the EEO effort has been the court decisions, whic;l first
tended to weigh heavily the interests of protected groups as opposed to other workers.
Through the early 1970s most court decisions tended to favor active Equal Employment and Affirmative Action programs.

The decision of the court in favor of Kaiser Steel

There is a wide variety. of evidence indicating that governmental
equal employment efforts have substantially improved the economic position
of black workers.

As might be expected given pressures of affirmative action pro- ..

grams to place and pronate minorities into higher level jobs that were previously
closed to thee, many of the gains were concentrated among the better educated and
skilled.

For the first time in American history, blacks began to obtain manager-

ial and professional jobs in major corporations •. The most rapid gains were made,
it is important to recognize, by young blacks and by black women, both of whom
attained rough economic parity with whites in many markets.

Finally, most studies

of the employment of blacks have found greater increases in employment in companies
influenced by federal antibias and affirmative action pressures than in companies
that are less influenced by such pressure (Burman, Ashenfelter & Heckman, Heckman
and Wolpin; see Goldman and Smith for an exception).
w~ile

most would agree that at least some of the post-l964 black

economic progress is due to the effect of antibias laws on company employment
practices, some have cited other factors as being important

policies designed to alleviate: under-representation in high level jobs.
S;omputerization
In addition to EEO pressures, the personnel practices of major corporations were also greatly affected by new computer techniques in the period.

For

the first tiQe companies have computerized personnel files available (some put
together as a result of court cases regarding discrimination) which permit more
detailed and rigorous tracking and analysis of internal labor markets.

The new

technology has begun and will continue to transform personnel policy into
a more integral part of corporate policy making.
Other Market Regulations
The federal government enacted several other
regulating the labor market in the period under study.

~ajor

pieces of legislation

Among the most important

were:
(a)

The Coal Hine Health and Safety Act (1969), which established

dust and ventilation standards in mines and compensation for victims of black lung
disease.

In the

year~

following the Act, fatality rates fell in bituminous coal,

apparently, at least partially, as a result of the regulations (Connerton).
(b)

The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (OSHA), which requires

that places of employment be free from "recognized hazards that are causing or are
likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees" and mandates the
Department of Labor to promulgate and enforce occupational health and safety
standards.

Despite the significant powers given to OSHA and efforts of the agency

to monitor work places, it is generally agreed that OSHA failed to live up to
its potential for reducing job injury and disease.

There is increasing realiza-

tion of the cOQplexities involved with health and safety prob1eQs, which will
not yield to simplistic strategies based on simple approaches (see Ashford,
SQith, Viscusi).
(c)

The Employee Retirement. Income Security Act, which ffiandated that

all retirement plans be vested after ten years, established financial stan-

-42dards for pensions, and ~hich provided federal insurance for pension plans.

As

is often the case with governmental regulations, in addition to its planned
effects on pension plans, ERISA appears to have unanticipated effects causing a
26/
number of plans by small companies to be closed down.-(d) Extension of Minimum Wage coverage.

While the level of the

minimum wage has not changed relative to average wages, the fraction. of the
work force covered has increased greatly, which can be expected to
its effect.

increase

In 1947 56% of workers were covered by the minimum wage; by 1963

the fraction covered had risen to
(e)

79%.

Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which outlaws discrimination

against workers between the ages of 40 and 70, and the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, which outlaws discrimination against handicapped workers.
Sepnding and Taxation
In addition to direct regulations, the government has influenced the
operation of the labor market through its social insurance and welfare manpower
training and taxation policies.

In the post-World War II period, many new pro-

grams were initiated and expenditures on existing programs increased while. tax
rates rose significantly.
In 1960 the United States federal expenditure on manpower programs was
approximately $250 million; in 1975 expenditures were over $5 billion a year, more
than a 20-fo1d increase.

The legislative cornerstone of this expansion is the

Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 (CETA), and its subsequent
amendments, which is designed to provide

training,emplo)~ent,

and related ser-

vices for economically disadvantaged, unemployed, and under-employed persons.
.

The

.

major titles of CETA authorize: a nationwide program of eI:lployment and training
services, including training, employment, counseling, testing, and placement administered for the most part by state and local govern::lents; transitional public
service employment and other manpower services in areas with high rates of un-

-43employment; nationally sponsor,ed training and job placement progr~II:s for such
special groups as youth, criminal

offenders~

persons of limited English-speaking

abili'ty, seasonal farmworkers, and others with particular market disadvantages;
the Job Corps program of intensive education, training, and counseling for disadvantaged youth; and temporary emergency public service jobs to reduce the
impact"of hiBh uQemp10yment.

For persons on we1fare,the Work Incentive (WIN)

Program is designed to provide comparable aid in obtaining skills and finding
jobs.

In 1976 there were about 2.5 million persons in CETA programs and over

two million registered for WIN.

Other programs gave direct financial aid to persons unable to work or
temporarily out of work.

Public, social welfare expenditures broadly defined,

the most important of which is Aid to Dependent Children, which provides money
largely for families lacking a male head of household, increased drastically in
the 1960s and 1970s, from 10% of GNP in 1960 to 19% in 1975.

Other major

programs include Social Security disability insurance, and workmen's compensation, which assist persons injured at work.

On the one hand,

they clearly raise the economic well-being of persOns suffering economic distress.
One estimate of the net effect of the welfare programs suggests that upwards of
30/

On the
other hand, the programs 'also reduce the incentive to work and thus reduce labor
force participation.

Uni ted States, by which I mean the differentials pi:lid workers categorized in

While differentials may not have

changed as rapidly as might be desired for optimal allocation of workers or elimination of discriminatory differences, there is no gainsaying the flexibility of
relative wages in responding to the changes in the supply-demand balance.
Table 6 summarizes evidence on some of the principal changes in the wage
structure in post-World War II years.
Education
One of the most widely heralded changes in the structure of wages has
been the decline in the advantage received by college graduate cen.

As the

table shows, from the 1950s through the 1960s, college men earned a sizeable
differential over men with just high school training.

In the 1970s, however, the

differential eroded rapidly -- part and parcel of the declining occupational

-46position of graduates depicted in Table 3 earlier.

The drop in the advantage

to college workers was most pronounced among the young, with starting bachelor's
graduates in several cases earning much less in real terms in the mid-1970s than
comparable workers earned at the end of the 1960s.

For instance, the real pay

for beginning B.S. science majors dropped by 21% from 1969 to 1975 and that of
32/
social science or humanities majors by 23%.
Since the direct costs of college
rose in the period, the rate of return to college fell carkedly which in turn
lowered enrollment rates among young persons.
The principal cause of the decline in the relative earnings of
young college graduates appears to be the enormous increase in the number of
graduates in the 1970s -- the result of the high fraction of (baby boom) young
persons enrolling for higher

~ducation

college relative to high school graduates.

rather than decreased demand for
Viewed.strictly from a human capital

investment interpretation, however, an alternative explanation of the change
can be developed: namely that the wages of young graduates have fallen because
graduates are caking greater investcents in on-the-job training as a means of
coping with the increased supply.

This view suggests that the

earnings of the workers who graduated in the 1970s will rise rapidly in the
1980s (Welch & Smith).

While the long-term significance of the depressed college

market of the 1970s thus will rtot be clear for some time,-- thecha.nges of the
period show dramatically the impact of supply and demand on relative earnings
and investments in skills.
Another important change in the structure of wages has been a marked
twist in age-earnings profiles.

As Table 6 shows, in 1968 25-34 year old men

earned 15% less than 45-54 year old men.
21%.

By 1975 the differential had risen to

Among college men, the ratio of 25-34 year. aIds earnin5s to those of

45-54 year olds fell from .72 in 1968 to .61 in 1975.

The remarkable increase in

the income advantage of older over young male workers in the period appears to
be primarily due to the changed age composition of the work force noted earlier,
apparently because younger and older male workers are imperfect substitutes in

-47production.

It previously eased the inflow of the large numbers 'of young

workers of the period into employQent and enabled the market to adjust to the
baby boom cohort without oassive increases in youth unemployment.

It may also

have created, however, a lifetillle· "cCiI.ort earnings gap" for the entrants of the
1970s.

Whether the sizeable drop in the earnings ·of the young in the 1970s will

persist, however, remains to be seen

(Welch and Smith).

Specific Skills Groups
Workers in certain occupational and industrial groups also experienced
marked changes in earnings relative to other workers in the postwar period.

In

the 1960s,construction average hourly earnings zoomed, rising from 1.26 times
those in manufacturing in 1947 to 1.56 times those in manufacturing in 1969,
only to fall to 1.37 times those in manufacturing by 1979.

Scientists, engineers,

college faculty and doctorate personnel enjoyed substantial increases in income
in the sixties and sluggish increases in the seventies.. Workers in the oil
industry had sizeable gains in the 1970s, as did those in coal.
Overall, the pattern of the 1970s was toward lower differentials between
more and less skilled workers, in contrast to stable or rising differentials in
the 1950s and 1960s.

As in other changes in the wage structure, the prime reason

appears to be shifts in the demand for those workers compared to the supply.
Finally, as noted earlier, one of the oajor changes in the wage structure
occurred along the racial dimension.

Black-white differences diminished signifi-

cantly, apparently as a result of increased demand for labor spurred by governmental EEO efforts.
Significance
The finding that relative wages have changed in the postwar
period in response to labor market conditions sugbests that the price system has
at the least operated in the right direction in rewarding and allocating workers among
sectors.

According to the post-war experience, largeillcrcdses in numbers of

workers in particular groups, relative to demand, produced sizeable drops in

-48wages relative to those of other workers, while large decLeases had the
opposite effect.

Composition of the Wage Bill
Table 7
in the U.S.:

docu~ents

another important chan&e in the pattern of wage payments

the increased importance of fringe or supplementary benefits.

By

1977 over one-third of compensation in major companies consisted of fringes, with
pension plans, vacation and holiday pay, and health insurance constituting
the bulk of privately agreed-upon fringes and social security, the most important
component of legally-required payments.
There are several reasons for the growth of fringe benefits:

the tax

advantages which accrue to most fringes, increased worker desires for certain benefits.as incomes rise, union pressures for fringes following rulings that fringes
are valid bargaining topics (fringe benefits are n larger share of wage bills in
union than in nonunion companies) and changes in social security and other l;:at.fQ.
While there are serious problems in international comparisons of wage
bills, particularly with regard to the institutional structure of work forces.
(distinction between regular and temporary workers, for example) available
data suggest that the tendency for

a

larger share of compensation to take the

form of fringes is not unique to the United States, and that the ratio of
supplementary payments to earnings in the U.S. is by no means high on an international scale.

Change (7):

Unemployl:lent and tolage Inflation

From the point of view of national policy two basic labor market problems
plague national economics:

unemployment and hourly wage inflation.

In the post-

World tolar II period under study, the level of unemployment' drifted up·...ards. the
composition pf unemployment changed, and there was a significant change in the
level of wage inflation and its link to unemployment and aggregate economic activity.
Level of Composition and

Unemploymen~

The level of unemployment in the United States appears to have increased
in the 1970s relative to the 1950s and 1960s.

From 1950 to 1959 unemployment

averaged 4.5% per year, with a range from 2.9% to 6.8%.

From 1960 to 1969, the

average was slightly higher at 4.8%, with a range from 3.5% to 6.7%.

From 1970 to
34/
1977 , however, unemployment averaged 6.3%, with a range from 4.8% to 8.5%.Analysis of the unemployment rates of separate groups of workers shows that
while changes in the demographic composition of the work force have contributed
to the higher rate, the up\-lard drift in the'1970s is not primarily the result of
changing mix of workers but is, instead, a phenomenon found among virtually all
groups of workers, though it is

-51governmental macroeconomic policy.

Most other

~~jor

countries have also

experien~ed

an increase in unemployment rates in the 1970s, pointing to world market conditions
as an underlyinK cause of the problem.
The incidence of unemployment in the U.S. has also changed significantly,
with young workers in general and black teenagers in particular having higher
rates of unemployment relative to other workers than in the past, exacerbating
the concentration of and inequality in unemplcynent.

On the other end of the

spectrum, white-collar workers and more highly educated workers have also had higher
rates of unemployment relative to others than in the past.
The changing patterns of unemployment rates over time is examined in
figure 4 in terms of the rates of unemployment for selected groups of workers and
the rates predicted by regression of those rates on those of other workers.

When

the deviation between actual and predicted rates rises over time, the rate of the
specified group worsens relative to the other group, and conversely, if the
deviations decline over time.
The figure shows:
a moderate increase in the unemployment rate of 16 to 19 year old

..

white young persons at given levels of total unemployment in the

,

1960s but not in the 1970s.
a more surprising and less noticed increase in the unemployment of
25 to 34 year old white men relative to older workers, possibly
attributable to demographic forces;
a marked increase in the unemployment rate of black teenagers relative
to the total unemployment rate.

The causes of the extraordinary

deterioration in the employment position of these youth has yet
to be satisfactorily explained.

\{hatever the causes, however, few

would disagree with the propositio~ that the deteriorated employment
of non-white youth constitutes one of the major ,socia-economic
problems of the period.

an increase in the unemployment rate of professional and college

workers relative to the less·skilled and ~ducated workers,

yet another indicator of the turnaround in the college job market
discussed earlier.
As a result of the changed pattern of unemployment rates and changes in
the composition of the work force, the unemployed worker of the late 1970s had
very different characteristics than the unemployed worker in earlier years.

highly educated and skilled than in the past.
The changing composition of unemployment suggests the need for different
policies to aid the jobless than in

th~

past.

Young unemployed workers, particu-

larly minority youth in inner cities, have a greater

ne~d

for job training and

related skill acquisition than the unemployed experienced heads of households
of previous periods.

Unemployed

profess~onal,

managerial, and other white-collar

or college educated workers also represent a new problem, for which existing
policies may be inadequate.
Wage Inflation
Concordant with the upward drift in unemployment over the period has been
an increase in the average rate of wage inflation, creating a substantial policy
problem.

From 1950 to 1959, hourly compensation of all persons in private busi-

nesses increased by 5.1% per annum; from 1960 to 1969, hourly compensation of
all persons in private business increased by 4.9% per annum; from 1970 to 1977,
the rate of increase was 7.1%.

in the 1970s despite increased unemployment appears to have significantly

Conclusion
"Each generation believes itself on the verge of a new economic era, an
era of fundamental change" (NBER, Receht Economic Changes in the United States,
1929, p. ix).
In three decades examined in this study, seven major changes have
taken place in the American labor market, signif~cantly altering the wages,
employment, and institutions at the work

plac~.

real wages and productivity declined sharply.

First, the rate of growth of

the retardation

in growth is a story of changes in the famous "residual", about which, by definition, we know little.
Second, there have been sizeable demographic changes in the composition
of employment:

more women workers, more younKworkers, m01?e educated workers,

and fewer older male workers.

In part these changes can be explained by changes

in labor market incentives, but at. least" some remain a puzzle.
Third, the composition of employment has changed sUb~tantially, with
the, number of 'workers .in white-collar and skilled jobs, in the South and
,', Southwest, and in local and state government employment rising while the number
in

blue-collar and lower skilled jobs has declined.

One noticeable pattern

',. h~s been that employment in skilled areas has fallen short of the growth of
the supply of educated labor, with a resultant drop in the quality of jobs
held by' the educated.

sector,s than wage changes.
Fou~th,

the trade union share of the work force has diminishe.d 5Mb-

"

effectiveness in contesting NLRB elections is also important in accounting for
the diminished number of private sector unionism.

Growth of public sector

organization appears to be closely linked to changes in public sector labor
relations laws.
Fifth, governmental regulation of the labor market and of the internal
operation of management and labor has been greatly expanded.

Equal employment

legislation and affirmative action requirements have "changed the personnel
function.

A wide variety of acts, like Occupation Health and Safety or the

Employee Retirement Insurance Security Act, have changed the "rules" of labor
market behavior, in some cases with sizeable effects on basic economic factors.

COtl)parisons With 1929 NBER Conference
The changes delineated in this paper can be fruitfully compared to
those

exatl)in~d

half a century earlier at the 1929 NBER Conference on Recent

Economic Changes, in which Leo Wolman wrote a section on labor.
Which of the seven changes are similar to those cited in the earlier
volume?

To what extent do our changes represent continuation of long-term

developments and to what extent do they significantly diverge from historical

-60changes?
An~wers to these questions should provide perspective on the nature of

changes in the post-World War II period.
Four of our changes, while different in some cases in direction, have
definite parallels with those in the earlier period.
In 1929, as in 1979, the changing demographic structure of the work force ,
due to declining birth rates and immigration wa~ of SOI:le concern.

In 1929, however,

the increased participation of women was not given serious attention.
Similarly, in 1929, as in 1979, patterns of change in the composition of
employment -- increases in white-collar and skilled jobs, declines in farming -_
received attention.

While the 1970s may be relatively unique in that growth of

employment in skilled areas has fallen short of the growth of educated labor
there is nothing surprising

~n

the existence of significant shifts in employment

among sectors.
Sizeable changes in the wage structure were also observed in the 1929
volume.

Though the direction and nature of changes differed fundamentally

between the periods, changes in relative wages appear to be a .hallmark of the
United States' labor market.
Decline in unionization in the 1920s

parallels to some extent the

decline in the post-World 1.Jar II period, though here more fundamental differences
also arise.

In the 1920s, the total number of union members, as well as the union

share of the work force fell, whereas in the post-World \-lar II period, union
membership rose, while the proportion of workers covered fell.

}loreover, there

was nothing in the 1920s comparable to the spurt in public sector organization
in the later period.

Still, in the period covered by this essay and in the

earlier period, declines in unionization were a major development.
Three of oui seven changes, by contrast, seem to differ greatly from those
stressed in the 1929 volume.
First is the increased governmental regulation of the labor market and

-61-

of the internnl opcrntiono of

r~nn~encnt ~nd

1nbor.

Governncntnl ir.tcrvcntion

in the market following World War I seems to have been sufficiently modest as to
draw virtually no attention from analysts.

Peace time growth of governmental

regulation in the recent decades appears to be a relatively unique development.
Second is the 1970s concern over the growth of real wages and productivity,
which has no parallel in the earlier period of time.

In the 1929 conference,

continued rapid advance of the economy was assured by all:

liThe spread of

higher living standards [is] not new, but in its degree and scope it has taken
on new importance" (NBER, P. xi).

The loss of confidence in growth, due to the slug&isl

performance in the 1970s, is a strikingly new development.
Third is the drift upwards in both unempioyment and rates of wage
inflation, which

~')nstitutes

the aggregate economic problem of the 1970s.

By

contrast, in 1929, there was little concern with overall levels of unemployment
(which were viewed as satisfactory) or with inflation, due to an "increasing
tendency" toward price staibility.
Finally, it is important to remember that all of the labor market
changes stressed in the 1929 conference were, of course, completely over-·
shadowed by the change about to occur -- the Great Depression, the development
of which no analyst managed to foresee.

Hopefully, the changes examined in

this paper will not be overshadowed by forces escaping current attention that
will yield a new economic disaster.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics data are contained in U.S. Department
of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Productivity and Technology,
"Estimated Hourly Compensation of Workers in Manufacturing; Ten Countries,
1960, 1965-1978", (October 1978).
If one correlates the rate of growth of real wage for 1967 to 1977 ,.lith
the level of real wages in 1967 in that document, one does find a negative

-63Spearman rank correlation of -.55, indicating that there is a pattern for slower
growth in higher wage countries.

However, less than 25% of the country varia-

tion in real wage growth can be explained by bariation in initial levels.
Thus the United States lags more in real wage ·growth than in productivity
growth.
