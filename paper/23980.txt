Taxing Humans: Pitfalls of the Mechanism Design Approach and Potential Resolutions

                                         ABSTRACT

A growing body of evidence suggests that psychological biases can lead different
implementations of otherwise equivalent tax incentives to result in meaningfully different
behaviors. We argue that in the presence of such failures of “implementation invariance,”
decoupling the question of optimal feasible allocations from the tax system used to induce
them—the “mechanism design approach” to tax analysis—cannot be the right approach
to analyzing optimal tax systems. After reviewing the diverse psychologies that lead to failures
of implementation invariance, we illustrate our argument by formally deriving three basic
lessons that arise in the presence of these biases. First, the mechanism design approach neither
estimates nor bounds the welfare computed under psychologically realistic assumptions about
individuals' responses to the tax instruments used in practice. Second, the optimal allocations
from abstract mechanisms may not be implementable with concrete tax policies, and vice-
versa. Third, the integration of these biases may mitigate the importance of information
asymmetries, resulting in optimal tax formulas more closely approximated by classical Ramsey
results. We conclude by proposing that a “behavioral” extension of the “sufficient statistics”
approach is a more fruitful way forward in the presence of such psychological biases.

1     Introduction

A standard assumption in optimal tax policy design is that individuals' behavior is governed


only by the choice-sets induced by the tax systemconditional on the choice-set induced, be-


havior does not vary across the tax systems that could be used to implement that choice set.


This assumptionwhich we refer to as     implementation invariance reduces     the question of


optimal tax-system design to an optimization problem over a set of feasible consumption bun-


dles satisfying incentive compatibility and government revenue constraints. The abstraction


from the practical considerations of tax policy implementation results in a framework that


is tractable and fruitful. This mechanism design approach to taxation has been broadly


applied to characterize the features of optimal policy in both static (e.g., Mirrlees, 1971) and


dynamic settings (for a review, see Golosov   et al.,   2007).


    In this paper, we articulate a challenge to the practical value of this approach: due to


the psychological complexity of how individuals respond to taxation, the details of the tax


system that induces a given choice set can substantially inuence the resulting behavior. The


growing evidence on the prevalence of taxpayer confusion, of heuristic optimization, and of


imperfect attention suggests that the assumption of implementation invariance does not hold


in practice. When this assumption fails, a policy analyst can be lead awry by the common


two-step procedure of rst considering the incentives induced by the optimal mechanism and


only later considering its implementation.


    In section 2, we summarize a series of recent empirical demonstrations of confusion, inat-


tention, and heuristic use, all of which lead people to suboptimally respond to tax incentives.


For each class of biases, we illustrate concretely the violations of implementation invariance


that result. We argue that biases in the understanding of taxes are widespread, that these bi-


ases aect central economic behaviors, and that these biases are shaped by the idiosyncrasies




                                               2
of dierent tax mechanisms in complex and subtle ways.


      In section 3, we formalize the consequences of violations of implementation invariance for


normative tax analysis. We build on a simple two-type model of optimal income taxation


proposed by Stiglitz (1982) in which individuals choose between pairs of before-tax income


z    (which corresponds to a choice of labor supply) and the resulting after-tax consumption


c.   Using several behavioral biases as examples, we formalize three implications. First, the


presence of these biases prevents the application of the revelation principle, a core tool of


mechanism design that allows the analyst to separate the question of analyzing optimal


behavior under a direct mechanism from the specics of the tax which implements it. As a


result, welfare under a direct mechanism neither estimates nor bounds the welfare attainable


at the true optimal policy. Second, we illustrate that there are biases that can render the


optimal allocation in a direct mechanism unimplementable with taxes, while the allocation


resulting from the optimal taxes is unimplementable with a direct mechanism. Third, we


show that the presence of these biases can mitigate the role of information rentsa central


concept of mechanism designand can ultimately result in tax analysis that more closely


resemble that of frameworks that are not tightly centered on understanding information


asymmetries, such as the Ramsey approach.


      In section 4, we assess the comparative advantages of alternative approaches to tax


policy analysis in the presence of psychological biases.     We argue that a modication to


the sucient statistics approach (for a review, see Chetty, 2009) provides a fruitful way


forward.    This approach works with an allowable set of tax instruments directly, deriving


optimal tax formulas involving elasticities and empirically-estimable formulations of bias.


In addition to its tractability, this approach also transparently highlights deviations from


standard optimal tax formulas. We present and discuss the key challenges to this approach,


and discuss its comparative advantages to the mechanism design approach.




                                                3
2    Violations of implementation invariance

To focus ideas and dene basic concepts, we begin by discussing a recent experiment that


cleanly demonstrates a failure of implementation invariance.     We then turn to a series of


examples demonstrating this phenomenon, and its causes, in the eld.




2.1 A stylized lab example
The cleanest possible demonstration of a violation of implementation invariance would consist


of a comparison of behavior under two meaningfully dierent tax instruments that induce


the same choice sets. Tax policies in the eld are rarely deployed in a manner that oers


this comparison directly. However, as pursued in Abeler & Jäger (2015), labor markets may


be designed in a laboratory setting that exactly satisfy these constraints.


    Abeler & Jäger create a simple approximation to a labor-supply decision within the


microcosm of the lab.   The participants in their experiment must decide how much labor


to provide in order to fund consumption. Labor is measured in the context of a real-eort


task adopted from Gill & Prowse (2012), in which the participant may move a series of


hundred-point slider scales to prespecied values. When time expires, participants receive


a piece-rate wage for each slider that is positioned on its assigned value. This experimental


task is arguably tedious, but it provides the participant with a means to trade current leisure


for experimental earnings.


    In the experiment, earnings from this task are subject to a progressive tax.        Across


treatment arms, the experimenters apply two tax systems that induce similar choice sets,


but are of signicantly diering complexity. In the simple treatment, the progressive tax is


implemented with two simply-articulated rules. The tax schedule traced by these rules can


be calculated with relatively little eort. In the complex treatment, the progressive tax is


implemented with 22 tax rules. The tax schedule traced by these rules closely approximates


that in the simple treatmentand thus induces approximately the same choices setsbut




                                              4
the calculation of this tax schedule is substantially more cognitively demanding.


   While the traditional mechanism design approach would treat these experimental taxes


as interchangeable tools for achieving the same behavior, Abeler & Jäger document substan-


tially dierent behavior across treatment arms. When nearly identical tax incentives were in-


duced through the complex system, subjects were less likely to choose the payo-maximizing


output level, and on average earned 23% less than subjects in the simple treatment arm.


Furthermore, as new tax rules were introduced across rounds in the experiment, subjects


were systematically less responsive to tax changes in the complex frame.         In short, these


mechanisms had diering eects on the distortionary impact of taxation, despite the near


equivalence of the choice-sets that the policies induced.


   The mechanism design approach takes as given that we may use arbitrarily complex tools


to induce the choice sets, and thus choices, that the mechanism designer views as desirable.


In practice, however, the quality of decision-making might decline if the choice environment


is imperfectly understood. This worry is undoubtedly relevant for behavior in the current


U.S. income tax system, commonly lamented for its extraordinary complexity.




2.2 Field evidence
Laboratory experiments such as those of Abeler & Jäger provide compelling illustrations


of failures of implementation invariance, but do not inform us about the biases that shape


people's responses to the actual tax systems used in practice. We now discuss the evidence


on biased responses to tax incentives in the eld. We focus on biases caused by confusion,


by heuristic adoption, and by dierential salience of dierent tax provisions.




2.2.1 Confusion

Perhaps the most straightforward and psychologically uncomplicated manner in which psy-


chological realism might inuence our tax policy analysis is through the serious treatment


of confusion.   If a taxpayer misunderstands the provisions of the tax, he will come to be-



                                              5
lieve he faces a dierent choice-set than he actually does. Under such circumstances, even an


otherwise-optimizing agent would appear to generate violations of implementation invariance


if the details of a tax instrument aect the manner in which it might be misunderstood.


   Given the dramatic complexity of taxes in the United States, it is perhaps unsurprising


that substantial confusion regarding tax provisions has been documented.        When directly


surveyed about the key parameters characterizing their federal income tax burdenlike their


marginal tax ratetaxpayers regularly report values with substantial individual error (Fujii


& Hawley, 1988; Blaufus   et al., 2013; Gideon, 2015; Rees-Jones & Taubinsky, 2016).   Analysis


of observational data reveals that there are large dierences in knowledge of taxpayers'


understanding of the tax code: Chetty    et al.   (2013) nd signicant dierences in bunching


at the refund-maximizing kink of the earned income tax credit (EITC), and show that


individuals who move from low-bunching neighborhoods to high bunching neighborhoods


increase their EITC refunds due to new information diusion. Moreover, signicant amounts


of tax benets are left on the table every tax year through, e.g., failures to claim itemized


deductions (Benzarti, 2016) or failures to claim the EITC (Bhargava & Manoli, 2015). The


diculty individuals face in understanding the complex tax code is argued to have generated


the large professional-tax-preparation industry in the United States (Slemrod & Bakija,


2008). Attempts to teach the tax code have been shown to be ineective, on average, but


can be eective when paired with expert advice (as in, e.g., Chetty & Saez, 2013).


   To concretely illustrate the potential for confusion to generate violations of implementa-


tion invariance, we focus on recent evidence arising from the work of Feldman    et al.   (2016).


The authors present a clear test of the possibility that taxpayers mistake predictable changes


in lump-sum transfers for changes in marginal tax incentives.


   Feldman   et al.   examine the eect of the Child Tax Credit (CTC), a transfer given


to households with a child younger than 17 in the calendar year.        While the size of this


transfer varies with income, virtually all lers with adjusted gross income between $30,000


and $100,000 were able to claim the maximum $1,000 credit in the window studied by the




                                                  6
authors. For this group, a loss of the CTC constitutes a lump-sum change in tax liability.


   The requirement that a household have a child under 17 at the end of the calendar


year introduces a discontinuity in the average tax credit received. A household whose child


ages out on December 31, 2010 could not claim the CTC for 2010, whereas a household


whose child ages out on January 1, 2011 could. This distinction is perfectly predictable.


Furthermore, the distinction does not change the marginal tax rate, and thus should not


inuence marginal tax incentives except through small income eects.       However, using a


regression discontinuity design, the authors document that the loss of the CTC is associated


with an approximately 0.5 percent decline in reported wage income relative to households


who have just retained the credit for another year. The authors document that this eect


is not driven by strategic timing of earnings, nor by direct eects of a child aging.   They


interpret their result as evidence that at least some households confuse factors that inuence


average tax rates with those that determine marginal tax rates.


   Under the assumption that households with a child born in late December do not have


meaningfully dierent preferences than those with a child born in early January, these results


illustrate a clear violation of implementation invariance.   Given that the CTC does not


mechanically aect marginal tax rates for the group studied, the loss of this credit does not


meaningfully induce dierent tradeos between lesiure and consumption. But by nevertheless


changing labor supply, the CTC must therefore have shaped taxpayers' misunderstanding of


the tax system. Upon observing an increase in their tax bill, the taxpayer incorrectly infers


that marginal tax rates have gone up, and changes choice behavior.




2.2.2 Heuristic Adoption

As documented by a large literature in psychology, decision makers often adopt simple


heuristics to approximate complex decision-rules when cognitively eortful decisions must be


quickly and regularly made. In an inuential paper, Liebman & Zeckhauser (2004) consider


and formalize two heuristics that they argue are sensible, and potentially common, means




                                              7
of approximating a convex schedule like the US income tax. These heuristics are presented


in gure 1, and are described below. Our notation and summary of these heuristics draws


heavily from our prior work on their empirical measurement (Rees-Jones & Taubinsky, 2016),


which we also summarize below.


     The rst heuristic,   ironing,   is applied by individuals who know the average tax rate they


face, and forecast tax liability by applying their average tax rate to all incomes. Using the


ironing heuristic, the forecasted tax at income            z   is given by   T̃I (z|z ∗ , θ) = A(z ∗ |θ) ∗ z ,   where


z∗   denotes the individual's own income,       θ   denotes all individual-specic characteristics that


determine the applicable tax schedule, and          A(z ∗ |θ) denotes the individual's average tax rate.
This heuristic has the practical benet that it leads to reasonably accurate beliefs about the


levels   of taxes when considering small deviations from one's current income.                           Thus, for


decisions about how to budget one's annual income, this heuristic leads to minimal errors.


     However, when used to infer the leisure/consumption combinations that form an indi-


vidual's choice set, this heuristic leads to meaningful errors. Specically, it leads to overes-


timation of the tax burden for comparatively low incomes and underestimation of the tax


burden for comparatively high incomes. This heuristic directly generates inaccurate beliefs


about marginal tax rates: because the tax schedule is convex, average tax rates are system-


atically smaller than marginal tax rates, and thus the application of this heuristic generates


a attening of perceived schedules.


     Feldman   et al.   (2016) argue that this heuristic potentially generates the confusion over


marginal tax rates they document, and similar responsiveness to shocks to average tax rates


have been documented in lab settings (de Bartolome, 1995). In a recent survey experiment


directly eliciting perceptions of tax schedules, Rees-Jones & Taubinsky (2016) nd evidence


that the ironing heuristic is adopted by 29-43% of US tax lers. In a non-tax application,


Ito (2014) shows that this heuristic rationalizes consumer response to non-linear electricity


pricing schedules.


     The second heuristic,    spotlighting,   is applied by individuals who know their own tax and




                                                       8
own   marginal   tax rate, and forecast tax liability by applying their marginal rate to the


dierence between their own income and the income amount under consideration. Using the


spotlighting heuristic, the forecasted tax at income         z   is given by   T̃S (z|z ∗ , θ) = T (z ∗ |θ) +
M T R(z ∗ |θ) ∗ (z − z ∗ ),   where   z∗   again denotes the individual's own income,         M T R(z ∗ |θ)
denotes the marginal tax rate at that income, and         T (z ∗ |θ)   denotes the true tax due at that


income.


    Within one's own tax bracket, the spotlighting heuristic leads to correct beliefs about the


level and slope of the tax schedule; as a result, under the assumption that leisure/consumption


pairs falling under other tax brackets are irrelevant alternatives in the choice set, this heuristic


does not meaningfully violate implementation invariance. While this heuristic has received


some theoretical attention, Rees-Jones & Taubinsky (2016) nd little evidence of its adoption


in their forecasting experiment.




2.2.3 Salience

A recent and growing literature has demonstrated that the visibility of taxes substantially


inuences behavioral response, and that this feature can be incorporated into standard tax


formulas with appropriate care.            In two pioneering studies, Chetty      et al.   (2009) demon-


strated that experimentally manipulated integration of taxes into posted prices for groceries


and alcohol meaningfully inuenced the resulting demand curves, and Finkelstein (2009)


demonstrated that the reduced visibility of road-use tax induced by the adoption of EZ-


pass reduced taxes' (dis)incentive eect on road use. Other recent advancements have stud-


ied how issues of salience aect the regressivity of commodity taxes (Goldin & Homono,


2013), how a social planner would optimally choose between dierentially salient tax instru-


ments (Goldin, 2015), and how issues of endogenous salience might aect tax policy analysis


(Feldman    et al.,   2015; Taubinsky & Rees-Jones, Forthcoming).              In short, in the context


of commodity taxation, salience has come to be viewed as an increasingly well-understood


instrument that shapes the welfare evaluation of tax policy.




                                                     9
   While the tax salience literature has often focused on commodity taxation, its core nd-


ings appear to apply to tax incentives administered through the income tax as well. Miller


& Mumford (2015) examine a change to the Child and Dependent Care Credit (CDCC)


introduced in 2003; this change aected the direct, visible value that could be claimed for


this credit that, considered in isolation, increased the subsidization of child and dependent


care administered through the income tax. However, this policy change also interacted with


provisions of the existing Child Tax Credit in a non-salient but osetting manner, in many


cases resulting in a net decrease in subsidization when all interactions are taken into account.


Miller & Mumford demonstrate that taxpayer response was most consistent with reaction


to the salient direct incentives of the tax, and with complete ignorance of the arguably non-


salient interactions with other provisions of the tax code. As summarized by the authors,


taxpayers increased their expenditure on child care in response to the expansion of the


CDCC regardless of whether the actual after-tax price of child care increased or decreased.


   Under reasonably mild assumptions on the demand for child care, these results imply a


violation of implementation invariance. For consumers facing an increase in the after-subsidy


price of childcare, the larger amount of childcare demanded post-reform was available in


their choice set prior to the tax change. Under the assumption that this change in subsidies


does not introduce implausibly large income eects, this necessitates a violation of our key


assumption. As a concrete illustration of the failure of implementation invariance, one may


consider the predicted eect of a completely transparent price change as contrasted with the


price-change introduced through interactions with multiple price interactions. If one believes


that transparently raising the price of child care would lower its demandi.e., that child


care is not a Gien goodthen behavior under these two choice-set-equivalent instruments


would vary.




                                              10
2.3 Summary
While we have emphasized several classes of psychological response that generate failures


of implementation invariance, we note that this list is not exhaustive. Even in the absence


of psychological biases, similar issues can arise when otherwise-similar tax systems induce


dierent compliance costs on taxpayers. In the domain of psychological responses, we have


not reviewed the substantial literature studying the inuence of heuristics and biases on tax

                         1
compliance decisions,        instead focusing our attention on demonstrations directly tied to the


labor supply and commodity demand issues that are central to welfare analysis.


    Even in the settings of greatest policy interest, our empirical understanding of taxpayer


psychology remains highly incomplete.             Absent a complete theory that species, e.g., the


formation of misperceptions and the adoption or rejection of biases, it is not possibly to fully


characterize the situations in which the failure of implementation invariance will become


rst-order. These caveats aside, across the examples we have considered, we nd empirical


support for the notion that implementation invariance fails in several eld settings of direct


policy interest. Furthermore, we present evidence that misperceptions of the tax schedule


are suciently widespread that such failures could conceivably extend to any decisions that


rely on accurate calculation of marginal tax incentives. While further work is needed to trace


the limits of when these failures do, and do not arise, the current literature suggests these


issues arise often enough that attention to their theoretical consequences is warranted.




3      Consequences of the failure of implementation invari-

       ance

In this section, we illustrate several key consequences of the failure of implementation invari-


ance for the formal analysis of tax policy. While the lessons we present are quite general, we

illustrate these lessons in the context of a standard, but simple, two-type model of income


taxation. We proceed by presenting the model, describing the mechanism-design approach


to its analysis, and then illustrate the key complications that arise when biases depend on


tax instruments.




3.1 A standard optimal income tax model
We consider a simple model of income taxation based on Stiglitz (1982).                          There are two


types of individuals in the economy, indexed by their earnings abilityθ                   ∈ {L, H}.   Those of


low earnings ability (θ     = L)    earn a wage     w(L)      per unit of labor and those of high earnings


ability (θ    = H)    earn a wage    w(H)    per unit of labor, where       w(H) > w(L).        The fraction of


each type in the population is denoted by          α(θ).   An agent with wage       w generates gross income
of   z =w·l       when he supplies   l   units of labor. All post-tax income is spent on consumption


c   which, together with the labor output          l,   generates utility   U (c, l).   This utility is typically


assumed to be concave, increasing in consumption, and decreasing in labor. In some of the


analysis that follows, we make the simplifying assumption that                     U (c, l) = c − ψ(l),   where


ψ 0 , ψ 00 > 0.
     The government's objective is to maximize social welfare:



                                             X
                                     W =          α(θ) · G(U (c(θ), l(θ)))                                   (1)
                                              θ

We assume that the government's evaluation of individual utility,                G, is a smooth and concave
function.


     The policy decision faced by the government is to specify a tax-and-transfer system


that maximizes social welfare. The assumption that                 G   is concave reects the government's


disfavor of inequality, and thus the optimal tax system would redistribute income from those


with high earnings ability to those with low earnings ability. Ability is not observed, however,


and so the tax must depend on the signal of ability contained in observable earnings (z(θ)).




                                                         12
   In contrast to taxing ability, taxing earnings is distortionary.    When those with high


earnings are taxed and those with low earnings are subsidized, a high-earnings-ability worker


might choose to reduce his labor supply in order to represent himself as a low-earnings-ability


worker.




3.2 A two-step approach to solving the optimal tax problem
This formulation of the social welfare problem illustrates a key trade-o in tax policy design.


On the one hand, the tax system must redistribute income from those of high earnings ability


to those of low earnings ability. On the other hand, this tax system must simultaneously


account for the fact that such redistribution can lead workers to misrepresent their ability


type through the earnings that they choose. Simultaneously mathematically accommodating


both the policy motives of the government and the misrepresentation motives of the individ-


ual can be challenging. However, a powerful result from mechanism designthe revelation


principlecan dramatically simplify the necessary analysis, and forms the heart of what we


term the mechanism design approach to tax policy.


   The revelation principle, as originally articulated in Myerson (1979), states that any


equilibrium allocation that can arise among fully optimizing agents can be achieved as an


equilibrium allocation in a   direct mechanism that   is, a mechanism that induces agents to


truthfully report their type.   This allows analysis to be divided into two simplied steps:


rst, characterizing behavior in a world where agents are incentivized to report their type,


and second, characterizing the tax system that induces those incentives. We illustrate these


two steps in the context of our simple model below.


   Step 1: characterizing the direct mechanism.      Rather than assuming that the govern-


ment only observes earnings, now assume that agents announce their type,        θ ∈ {L, H}.
The planner assigns an allocation that depends on that announcement,         (z(θ), c(θ)).   The


set of allocations must satisfy incentive compatibility (IC) constraintswhich ensure that


individuals are incentivized to announce their types honestlyand a budget balance (B)



                                              13
constraintwhich ensures that total consumption in the economy does not exceed total


earnings. Formally, the government maximizes



                                              X                       z(θ)
                                  max             α(θ) · G(U (c(θ),        ))                                 (2)
                                (c(θ),z(θ))
                                              θ
                                                                      w(θ)

subject to the constraints




 c(H) − ψ(z(H)/w(H)) ≥ c(L) − ψ(z(L)/w(H)) (IC-H :                      no incentive for   H   types to lie)


   c(L) − ψ(z(L)/w(L)) ≥ c(H) − ψ(z(H)/w(L)) (IC-L:                     no incentive for   L   types to lie)


            z(H) + z(L) ≥ c(H) + c(L) (B)


Typically, only conditions IC-H and B are binding at the optimum. If high-ability taxpayers


are indierent between their allocation and the allocation of the low-ability taxpayers, then


low-ability taxpayers will strictly prefer the allocation that entails less consumption since


generating income is more costly for them.


   Step 2: implementing the direct mechanism.              Once the optimal direct mechanism is char-


acterized, the second step is to reverse-engineer the tax system that would implement the


incentives in that optimum.        In the simple optimal taxation model presented here, this


is straightforward.    The income tax function must satisfy               T (z(θ)) = z(θ) − c(θ),       and it


must assign suciently high punishments to deviations from earning                     z(H)      or   z(L).    A


smooth tax function would, for example, have to satisfy               (1 − T 0 (z(θ)))Uc (c(θ), z(θ)/w(θ)) +
 1
    U (c(θ), z(θ)/w(θ))
w(θ) l
                          = 0   to ensure that individuals do not want to deviate from their


assigned allocations   (c(θ), z(θ)).   Generally, while the optimal direct mechanism is unique, it


can be implemented with many dierent kinds of tax functions.




                                                      14
3.3 Implementation invariance and its failure
In the context of this simple model, we may dene implementation invariance as a restriction


that taxpayers' preferences over consumption and labor cannot be inuenced by the step-


two tax system induced. Consider an individual who chooses a consumption-earnings bundle


(c, z) over (c0 , z 0 ) when both options are available.     This decision is implementation invariant


if any tax system   T   satisfying   z − T (z) = c   and   z 0 − T (z 0 ) = c0   results in the same apparent


preference. The literature reviewed in the previous section suggests violations of this principle


arise in situations where inattention, misperception, or heuristics guide decisions.


    Notice that individuals whose decisions are not implementation invariant violate ba-


sic tenants of optimization appealed to in the statement of the revelation principle. As a


result, use of the two-stage procedure in the previous section is no longer ensured to be


valid. This failure may be understood to be generated by a disjoint between the incentive-


compatability constraints that restrict a fully-optimal decision maker and the                      perceived

incentive-compatibility constraints that govern a biased decision-maker. Stated informally,


the incentive-compatability constraint generates a threshold on how much you can tax an


individual before inducing a misrepresentation of type.                 If dierent tax systems generate


dierent types of misunderstanding, then they similarly generate dierent such thresholds.


This complicates analysis, but also introduces new tools to the policy maker.


    It is worth noting that many commonly-studied biases do not operate through this chan-


nel of misunderstood incentive compatibility constraints. For example, behavioral models of


prospect theory or sophisticated present bias are better understood as cases where the deci-


sion maker does accurately understand the constraints faced, but holds an individual utility


function that is viewed as normatively undesirable by the social planner (e.g., attending


to irrelevant reference comparisons or applying impatient time discounting). Cases such


as these need not generate violations of implementation invariance; indeed, variants of the


mechanism design approach have been successfully applied to these biases (see, e.g., Kanbur


et al.,   2008; Lockwood, 2015).



                                                     15
3.4 Consequences of the failure of implementation invariance
We use a series of examples to illustrate several key implications of the violation of implemen-


tation invariance. In each example, we assume that choices reveal preferences under a direct


mechanism, whereas choices may be biased when incentives must be inferred from a tax.


While the contrasts and consequences that we highlight are exposited under highly stylized


assumptions, we believe they illustrate the the broader point that the welfare analysis of tax


policies can lead to meaningfully dierent conclusions in the presence of this class of biases.


In cases where the results are not proven in-text, proofs may be found in the Appendix.




Lesson 1: The optimal tax system may induce a consumption-labor allocation
that is dierent than the one implemented with the optimal direct mechanism.
The allocation induced by the optimal tax system may generate higher or lower
welfare than would be induced under the direct mechanism.

To demonstrate Lesson 1, consider the consequences of the salience of an income tax. Suppose


that when individuals choose labor supply, they make decisions based on a perception of the


tax represented by   T̃ = σT .   When   σ = 1,   individuals correctly attend to the taxes in place.


When   σ > 1,   taxes are overly salient. When     0 ≤ σ < 1,   taxes are partially ignored.


   To illustrate the impact of salience on welfare, consider rst the extreme case where


individuals choose labor supply as if there is no tax in place (σ      = 0).    In this case, the tax is


entirely ignored, and as a result it does not distort behavior: regardless of the tax, individuals


choose the ecient level of labor supply satisfying        ψ 0 (l(θ)) = w(θ).   This means that it is


possible to achieve full redistribution without creating ineciencies, simply by choosing a tax


function that satises   z(H) − T (z(H)) = z(L) − T (z(L)).       In constrast, under the approach


taken in the mechanism design problem of section 3.2, this rst-best level of labor supply


would be viewed as unobtainable. The presence of this bias facilitates the maximization of


our social welfare function.


   In contrast, when taxes are overly salient (σ        > 1),   the distortionary consequences of a



                                                   16
tax are even greater than they would be under the assumption of optimal behavior. Since


distortionary motives are the primary cost of redistribution, in this case the presence of this


bias hinders the maximization of our social welfare function.


   This may be summarized in the following formal result:



Proposition 1. At the optimal tax system, the social welfare function expressed in equation
1 is decreasing in scaling parameter σ . When σ < 1, the welfare that results in the optimal

tax system is higher than would be obtained under the optimal direct mechanism. When

σ > 1, the welfare that results in the optimal tax system is lower than would be obtained
under the optimal direct mechanism.


Lesson 2: The allocation implemented by the optimal direct mechanism may
not be implementable by any income tax. Conversely, equilibrium allocations
obtainable under some biases may not be implementable by a direct mechanism
among optimizers.

We illustrate this point by a simple example of a taxpayer who adopts the ironing heuristic.


As reviewed in section 2.2.2, this taxpayer perceives the tax schedule to be linear, with slope


τ (z(θ)) = T (z(θ))/z(θ).   Further suppose that   ψ(l) = l2 /2.
   Under the direct mechanism, the binding IC constraint is given by




                                  z(H)2 − z(L)2
                     c(H)-c(L)=                      (Direct Mechanism IC)                      (3)
                                     2w(H)2

   Under ironing, the misperception of the tax schedule leads to the dierent rst-order


condition   1 − T (z(θ))/z(θ) = z(θ)/w(θ)2 .    Since   c(θ) = z(θ) − T (z(θ)),   this implies that


c(θ)/z(θ) = z(θ)/w(θ)2 ,    and thus that   c(θ) = z(θ)2 /w(θ)2 .   Thus under ironing, the con-


sumption allocations must satisfy




                                                17
                                         z(H)2 z(L)2
                            c(H)-c(L)=        -             (Ironing IC)                         (4)
                                         w(H)2 w(L)2

                                          z(H)2 z(L)2       z(H)2 −z(L)2
Generically, it cannot be the case that        -
                                          w(H)2 w(L)2
                                                        =     2w(H)2
                                                                         , which implies that the op-


timal bundle under the direct revelation mechanism cannot be implemented with an income


tax when individuals iron.


   Conversely, because in the two-type model ironing leads the high wage types to think


that the tax on low wage types is higher than it actually is, the low type's actual labor-


consumption allocation would appear much more appealing to the high types were it shown


in a direct mechanism. This suggests that the direct mechanism frame may provide a higher


incentive for the high types to deviate downward.           Proposition 2 below provides a more


general characterization.



Proposition 2.   Consider the social welfare function in equation 1 and suppose individuals

are ironers. Generically, there does not exist a tax function T that implements the optimal

allocation of the optimal direct mechanism. Moreover, the resulting allocation of consumption

that is obtained from solving for the optimal tax function T cannot be implemented using a

direct mechanism when ψ(l) = lρ /ρ for ρ > 1 suciently small.

   This leads to the broader lesson that the set of allocations that are are feasible when


taxpayers are perfect optimizers might not be feasible when considering taxpayers' imperfect


reactions to real-world policy tools. Conversely, desirable real-world outcomes may seem


infeasible when analyzed under the assumption of perfect optimization.




Lesson 3: The reaction to information asymmetries that generates the key ten-
sion of the mechanism design approach may be mitigated or eliminated.

Recall that in the standard model, perfect redistribution is not possible because the high type


must have incentives that are high enough to not imitate the low type. With        ψ(l) = l2 /2, this

                                               18
incentive compatibility constraint is presented in equation (3). The constraint captures the


key innovation of optimal tax analysis in the spirit of Mirrlees (1971): because of asymmetric


information, taxes can still be distortionary even without any arbitrary constraints on the


tax tools such as linearity. The optimal taxation problem thus builds on broader principles


of mechanism design of maximizing transfers from the high types by paying them minimal


information rents.


    Misperceptions of taxes can fundamentally change the principles of optimal tax analysis,


and may completely eliminate the role of concepts such as information rents.                             Indeed,


this outcome has already been demonstrated when discussing Lesson 1 above, in which


distortionary behavior was eliminated in the case where perceived taxes were scaled to zero.


Intuitively, these ndings mirror the growing set of demonstrations that behavioral biases


can mitigate the negative consequences of information asymmetries in insurance markets,


for the similar reason that agents cannot claim rent for information that they have ignored


(Handel, 2013; Handel & Kolstad, 2015; Handel                      et al.,   2015; Spinnewijn, 2017).        While


the assumptions of the illustration in Lesson 1 are extreme, more generally the impact of


heuristics and biases can be to mitigate the role of information rents and to push optimal


tax analysis more towards the mechanics represented in models of Ramsey taxation.


    We illustrate this idea by demonstrating the reversal of a core principle of taxation: that


in the presence of income taxation, commodity taxes should only be used if they help to


target taxes to those of high earnings ability.


    Consider, following Stiglitz (1982), an extension of the model insection 3.1, in which


individuals choose before-tax income               z and a consumption bundle (c1 , c2 ).    One interpretation


is that    c1   and   c2   are dierent commodities.         Another interpretation is that       c1   is period 1


consumption and            c2   is period   2   consumption.    For simplicity, assume that      U (c1 , c2 , l, θ) =
u(c1 ) + v(c2 , θ) − ψ(l).
    In the standard model, when both types                  L   and   H   have the same subutility      v(c2 , θ) ≡
v(c2 ),   the optimal allocation must always satisfy            v 0 (c2 (θ)) = u0 (c1 (θ)) for each type (Stiglitz,


                                                           19
1982). This means that linear, nonlinear, or means-tested taxes on                                       c2   are   not   justied when


dierent types' preferences are homogeneous. This result is not specic to a two-type model


and holds more generally for a continuum of types (Atkinson & Stiglitz, 1976; Saez, 2002;


Golosov       et al.,     2013).


     For unbiased consumers, taxes (or subsidies) on                                c2   are justied only when they can be


used to better screen between low and high types. When those of higher earnings ability

                                                            vc2 (c2 ,θ)
have a greater preference for                c2    (i.e.,
                                                             u0 (c1 )
                                                                        is increasing in         θ),   it then becomes optimal to


have some form of a tax on               c2 . 2   Greater consumption of                 c2   now serves as an additional signal


that an individual has high earnings ability, and thus taxing these individuals can eciently


increase the redistributive properties of the tax system. Explicit formulas for optimal taxes


on   c2   are complex, however, as they depend intricately on the informational advantages that


the commodity taxes have over the income tax.


     The case for commodity taxation can be fundamentally aected by the presence of more


realistic psychological assumptions. In particular, the psychological assumption that indi-


viduals perfectly compute the labor-supply incentives induced by commodity taxes is quite


demanding; more realistically, consumers might at least partially neglect the labor-supply


incentives induced by taxes on                    c2 .
     To illustrate formally, suppose the government chooses an income tax                                           T (z) on before-tax
earnings and a linear commodity tax                         t   on   c2 .   The individual rst chooses earnings               z   and a


consumption bundle             c1   and   c2      such that         c1 + (1 + t)c2 ≤ z − T (z).           Suppose, however, that


individuals neglect to consider the tax                         t   on   c2   when choosing their labor supply, and only


react to the commodity tax after they have generated their income and are observing the


after-tax prices of both            c1   and      c2 .   Letting     g(θ)     denote the social marginal utility of income


to a type      θ,   the eects of increasing the commodity tax are now as follows:


     •    A decrease in revenue following a substitution away from                                 c2 , given by t dcdt2 = −tζ 1+t
                                                                                                                                c̄2
                                                                                                                                    dt,
          where     c̄2   denote aggregate consumption of                     c2   and   ζ   is the price elasticity of (aggregate)

     2 Conversely, when higher types have a lower preference for c , it is optimal to have some form of a subsidy
                                                                  2
on   c2   (Atkinson & Stiglitz, 1976; Saez, 2002; Golosov et al., 2013).



                                                                         20
       demand for      c2 .

   •   A mechanical revenue eect given by         c̄2 dt,   where   c̄2   denotes total consumption of     c2 .

   •   A mechanical welfare eect given by        −E[g(θ)c2 (θ)]dt.

The sum of these eects must be zero at the optimum:




                                      c̄2
                              −λtζ        dt + λc̄2 dt − E[g(θ)c2 (θ)]dt = 0.
                                     1+t

where   λ   is the marginal value of public funds. Solving the above equation for                t   then yields


the following result:



Proposition 3.        When individuals are inattentive to the commodity tax on the labor supply

margin, the optimal commodity tax t satises


                                         t    λ − E[g(θ)c̃2 (θ)]
                                            =                                                                (5)
                                        1+t         λζ

where c̃2 (θ) = c2 (θ)/c̄2 is the share of c2 consumption by type θ, and λ is the marginal value

of public funds.

   There are several noteworthy features of formula (5). First, notice that it is the standard


Ramsey formula with redistributive concerns (Diamond, 1975).                          Second, notice that the


formula holds regardless of the extent to which preferences for                  c2   dier between high and


low types:     whether the Engel curve for        c2   is driven by income eects or heterogeneous


preferences correlated with earnings ability does not matter. In contrast to the core lessons


from mechanism design, the formula for the optimal commodity tax here does not depend

                                                                     vc2 (c2 ,θ)
at all on the extent to which introducing distortions to                         allows the designer to reduce
                                                                      u0 (c1 )

the information rents that must be payed to the high types.                     This is because individuals


ignore the tax    t   on the labor supply margin, and thus the presence of the income tax does


not fundamentally change the basic logic eshed out in the classical Ramsey approach.

3.5 Broader implications for mechanism design
In this paper, we have been critical of what we've termed the "mechanism design approach",


specically referring to the 2-step procedure outlined in section 3.2.   We do not mean to


suggest that the general approach of mechanism design itself should be abandoned. Rather,


when pursuing the goals of mechanism or policy design, we urge caution when making


use of simplifying short-cuts that rely critically on perfect individual understanding and


rationality in situations where behavioral biases are widespread, We have documented the


consequences of these simplifying assumptions in the tax setting, but we note that similar


tensions have been documented when analyzing consumers' failures to reveal their valuation


type ' in Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanisms (Cason & Plott, 2014) or auctions (Kagel


et al.,   1987), or student's failure to reveal their preference type in matching mechanisms


(Rees-Jones, Forthcoming; Hassidim      et al.,   2016).




4     Discussion

If the manner in which taxes are implemented is fundamentally intertwined with the manner


in which decisions are made, the two-stage procedure of separating the question of optimal


behavior under direct mechanisms from the question of implementing the direct mechanism


poses a dicult foundation for the integration of psychological realism. Instead, the com-


putation of optimal feasible allocations and the implementation of these allocations must be


considered simultaneously.


    The simultaneous consideration of these two questions is implicit in the alternative ap-


proach summarized by Diamond & Saez (2011), which is to rst write down a limited set of


possible tax instruments and then to optimize over those instruments. Within this frame-


work, a particularly fruitful technique has been to express optimal tax formulas in terms


of measurable sucient statistics such as elasticities or social marginal welfare weights.


Because of the emphasis on measurable responses to actual tax instruments, this approach is




                                                   22
more easily extended to incorporate psychological biases. The key additional statistic needed


to compute optimal tax policy is a price-metric measure of bias: a monetized measure of the


dierence between what people would optimally do and what they actually do.




4.1 A concrete illustration of the sucient statistics approach
To provide a more concrete illustration of the sucient statistics approach, we summarize


the formula provided by Farhi & Gabaix (2015) for a nonlinear income tax with a continuum


of productivity types, and for utility functions of the form                                U (c, l) = c − ψ(l).        In particular,


assume that individuals perceive the actual income tax                                  T   to be   T̃ ,   where   T̃ (z)   depends on


the actual income tax                      T (z)   on earnings      z,   as well as the the individual's actual earnings                 z∗,
and the tax paid on those earnings                           T (z ∗ ).
     This formulation captures both the salience and ironing examples studied in the previous


section. In the case of salience,                       T̃ (z) = σT (z).        In the case of ironing,      T̃ (z) = T (z ∗ ) + (z −
         ∗
z ∗ ) T (z
        z∗
           )
             .


     Farhi & Gabaix (2015) show that for this broad class of misperceptions, the optimal tax
                                                                                              0 (z)
                                                                                             TR
rates depend on the sum of two terms.                                    The rst term,         0 (z) , is the standard optimal
                                                                                            1−TR

tax formula for rational consumers, as characterized by Saez (2001). This depends on the


governments' redistributive preferences as well as the usual measurable statistics: the distri-


bution of earned income and the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the marginal

                  3
tax rate.


     The second term, denoted                        τ̃ b (z),   is essentially a price metric for consumers biases. This


term answers the following question:                               if consumers were fully debiased, by what percent


would the marginal keep rate,                         1 − T 0 (z),   need to be increased so that consumers choose the

    3 To dene this term formally, let                  H   be the cumulative density function of income, with a probability
density      h.       Let   ζ   be the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the keep rate            1 − T 0 (z).   Let   h∗   be the
                                 ∗                 h(z)
virtual density               h (z) :=   1−T 0 (z)+ζzT 00 (z) . Then the optimal income tax satises

                                                     TR0 (z)      1 1 − H(z)
                                                               =             E[g(z 0 )|z 0 ≥ z]
                                                   1 − TR0 (z)   ζ(z) λzh(z)

   where     λ is the marginal value of public funds and g(z) is the social marginal utility of income to a z -earner.

                                                                           23
                                                                                                      (1−T 0 (z))− 21 ψ 0 (z/w)
same amount of labor as they do in the biased state? Formally,                           τ̃ b (z) =            1−T 0
                                                                                                                                .


    With these two terms in hand, Farhi & Gabaix (2015) show that the optimal income tax


satises




                                          T 0 (z)        b     TR0 (z)
                                                    = τ̃   +                                                                    (6)
                                        1 − T 0 (z)          1 − TR0 (z)

Formula (6) provides an immediate characterization of the optimal income taxes for the


salience and ironing biases we have discussed.               In the case of salience, we have                          τ̃ b (z) =
            0
         T (z)                                                T 0 (z)          1      T 0 (z)
(1 − σ) 1−T 0 (z) ,   which leads to the simple formula
                                                             1−T 0 (z)
                                                                           =   σ
                                                                                   · 1−TR 0 (z) .   In the case of ironing,
                                                                                          R
                              A(z)
we have     τ̃ b (z) = 1 −   1−T 0 (z)
                                       , which can also be plugged into (6) to obtain a formula for the


optimal income tax.


    An under-appreciated insight is that while             τ̃ b (z)    could be the result of many dierent


psychologies, the empirical strategy used to quantify                 τ̃   does not have to depend on the psy-


chology in play, and can be largely an extension of standard revealed preference methods.


Once the welfare-relevant domain (Bernheim & Rangel, 2009) is identied, the bias mea-


sure is constructed as the wedge between choices in the welfare relevant domain and the


choices normally observed.          This approach has been applied to assess the welfare costs of


biases in a variety of tax settings, such as quantifying the consequences of salience (see, e.g.,


Chetty     et al.,    2009; Taubinsky & Rees-Jones, Forthcoming). In these approaches, the au-


thors compute the change in posted prices that would alter demand as much as a debiasing


intervention that displays tax-inclusive nal pricesthe assumed welfare relevant domain.


    A simple example of empirically quantifying such price-metrics in a non-income tax do-


main is provided by Allcott & Taubinsky (2015), who run an experiment that provides a


direct estimate of bias for each consumer's valuation of energy ecient lightbulbs (CFLs).


They compute willingness to pay (WTP) for more versus less energy ecient lightbulbs in a


standard market frame, and then measure how the distribution of WTP changes when biases


arising from inattention or incorrect beliefs are eliminated via an informational intervention


that directs attention.



                                                      24
    While experiments of this nature are compelling, they place signicant demands on em-

                                                                                                  4
pirical implementation: they rely on within-subject manipulation of the welfare frame                 and


observation of the consequences of that change on behavior holding all else constant.                  In


some cases, experiments satisfying these desiderata are infeasible, such as when assessing


labor supply response to income tax misperception. However, other strategies for measur-


ing bias are still available.    For example, Gerritsen (2016) measures the disjoint between


chosen and happiness-maximizing labor supply based on subjective well-being data, and


integrates the resulting wedge into optimal tax analysis.          Rees-Jones & Taubinsky (2016)


directly measure individual heuristic use in the context of a forecasting experiment, and


then assess the predicted consequences of these biases if they were acted upon in a standard


model of labor-supply determination.


    Through the adoption of empirical strategies like those discussed above, sucient statis-


tics formulas such as those presented by Farhi & Gabaix (2015) are fully implementable using


standard methods for estimating elasticities, and extensions of standard revealed preference


methods for computing price-metric measures of bias.




4.2 Challenges for future work
An important challenge with extending the sucient statistics approach to incorporate indi-


viduals' mistakes is the critical need to have individual-level measures of biases, rather than


just population means. In the context of Allcott and Taubinsky's (2015) welfare analysis of


taxes on inecient lightbulbs, the eects of a tax change are determined not by the popula-


tion average of bias, but rather by the bias of consumers who are marginal to a tax change.


Allcott and Taubinsky show that without restrictive assumptions, the only way to obtain


the necessary measures of bias is to estimate bias at the individual level. In the context of


Taubinsky and Rees-Jones's (Forthcoming) analysis of sales taxes in the presence of hetero-


geneous inattention, the mean and the variance of consumers' scaling of the tax, together

   4 E.g., manipulating the presentation of tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive prices, or examining CFL pur-
chasing behavior before and after information provision.



                                                    25
with the standard components of rational deadweight-loss calculations, are necessary and


sucient for computing eciency costs. Thus, in contrast to the case when bias is homoge-


nous (Chetty   et al.,   2009), aggregate data is insucient for policy analysis: measurement of


heterogeneity across individuals is necessary for understanding welfare eects.


   These examples illustrate a key challenge that arises in economic welfare analysis when


biased decision-makers are present. In a standard model of optimizing consumers, marginal


benets must equal the marginal costs or the price at the margin. Thus, even if consumers


are heterogeneous, the marginal consumers who determine market prices have homongenous


valuations. This marginal homogeneity is essential for inferring welfare by observing only


aggregate changes in behavior. In the presence of behavioral biases, however, marginal bene-


ts need not equal marginal costs, and this dierence will be heterogeneous when consumers


are heterogeneous in their biases.      While analysts often restrict their attention to biases'


impact on average incentives, the role of biases as hetereogeneity-inducing devices can be,


at times, of greater quantiative importance to policy analysis.


   While the presence of heterogeneity on the margin does complicate analysis, it does not


fundamentally change the principles by which the standard sucient statistics approach may


be deployed, nor does it fundamentally change the strategies for how bias should be mea-


sured. However, applying these strategies in the presence of this heterogeneity does require


especially rich data sets that allow for robust measurement at the individual level. Observa-


tional or quasi-experimental data of this type is not always available, requiring researchers to


design new experiments that allow more granular measurement. As the literature progresses,


an iterative application of the sucient statistics approach to welfare, paired with granular


measurement of heterogeneous biases in tax settings, appears to be both a conceptually jus-


tied and practically implementable approach to the development of empirically informed


tax policy.

A.1 Proof of Proposition 1
We show that welfare under the optimal income tax is decreasing in        σ.   This will establish


the whole proposition since for   σ = 1,   consumers perceive the taxes correctly and thus the


                                                31
direct mechanism formulation is equivalent to the the optimal income tax formulation.


   For a given   σ,   let   Tσ   be the optimal income tax.       Note that it must bind at the high


types' IC constraint:




        z(H) − σTσ (z(H)) − (z(L) − σTσ (z(L)) = ψ(z(H)/w(H)) − ψ(z(L)/w(H)).


We now show that if         σ   decreases by some small amount       dσ ,   it will be possible to achieve


more redistribution while keeping the before-tax choices            z(H)     and   z(L)   constant. To that

                                                                                                  σ
end, dene   Tσ−dσ    to satisfy    (σ − dσ)Tσ−dσ (z) = σTσ (z);      that is,     Tσ−dσ (z) =       T (z).
                                                                                                 σ−dσ σ

Then, because   Tσ (z(H)) > 0       and   Tσ (z(L)) < 0   at the optimum, this tax must achieve more


redistribution, which increases social welfare. And by construction, it still satises the high


types' IC constraint:




z(H)−(σ−dσ)Tσ−dσ (z(H))−(z(L)−(σ−dσ)Tσ−dσ (z(L)) = ψ(z(H)/w(H))−ψ(z(L)/w(H)).


This new allocation must increase welfare since the labor earnings are held constant while


the distribution of consumption becomes more equal.




A.2 Proof of Proposition 2
First we show that the consumption bundle from the optimal direct mechanism can't be


implemented with an income tax amongst ironers.                 The optimal direct mechanism must


satisfy the classic no distortion at the top result:        ψ 0 (l(H)) = wH .     Now the only way an


income tax can implement the same result for the              H   types is by putting no tax on those


consumers; if they do see a positive tax       T (z(H)), then their average tax rate will be positive,
which will make them think that their marginal tax rate is positive because of the ironing


heuristic, and so they will want to choose labor satisfying          ψ 0 (l(H)) < w(H).       But since the


tax raises no money from the high types, it must then also satisfy                 T (z(L)) = 0.   Thus, if


                                                    32
the income tax does not distort the high types' labor earnings, then it cannot achieve any


redistribution.     However, the optimal direct mechanism achieves a partially redistributive


allocation satisfying       c(H) < z(H)       and   c(L) > z(L).      To summarize, the optimal direct


mechanism achieves some redistribution, while generating no distortion to the high types'


labor earnings.       With the ironing psychology, however, it is impossible to satisfy both of


these criteria.


      Second, we show that the consumption bundle from the optimal tax cannot be imple-


mented with an optimal direct mechanism.                  When individuals are ironers, the rst order

                ψ 0 (z(θ)/w(θ))
condition is
                      w(θ)
                                  = 1 − T (z(θ))/z(θ).   But since   c(θ) = z(θ) − T (θ),   this implies that


c(θ) = ψ 0 (z(θ)/w(θ)) · (z(θ)/w(θ)).         Thus for this allocation to be implementable in a direct


mechanism under the assumption that              ψ(l) = lρ /ρ,   it must satisfy




              (z(H)/w(H))ρ /ρ − (z(L)/w(H))ρ /ρ ≤ (z(H)/w(H))ρ − (z(L)/w(L))ρ .

For   ρ   suciently close to 1, however, the left-hand side of the above inequality will actually


be greater than the right-hand side because              z(L)/w(H) < z(L)/w(L).

Notes:    This gure presents an illustration of the ironing and spotlighting heuristics applied
to a generic convex schedule. When using these heuristics, the taxpayer linearizes the convex
schedule according to parameters local to his own position on the schedule, indicated by the
red dot. Under the ironing heuristic, the taxpayer forecasts by applying his average tax rate
at all points, resulting in the observed secant line.    Under the spotlighting heuristic, the
taxpayer forecasts by applying his marginal tax rate to the change in income that would
occur, resulting in the observed tangent line.
