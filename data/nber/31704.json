    "abstract": "\n\nMany countries subsidize agricultural inputs but require farmers to travel to retailers to access inputs, just as for normal purchases. What effect do travel costs have on subsidy take-up and input usage, particularly for remote farmers? We analyze Malawi's Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP), and show that travel-cost-adjusted prices are substantially higher in remote areas. However, subsidy redemption is nearly universal. We make use of a policy change in 2017-19 which took centralized control of beneficiary selection and find that FISP eliminates the sizeable remoteness gradient that exists for non-beneficiaries. Our results demonstrate that subsidy programs may narrow spatial inequities.\n\n",
