ABSTRACT
What a country has done in the past, and what other countries are doing in the present, can
feedback for good or for ill in debt markets. We develop a simple model of sovereign bond
markets with global investors and endogenous information acquisition about fundamental default
probabilities. This model displays hysteresis and contagion in sovereign bond spreads. Small
fundamental shocks in one country can induce investors to acquire information, generating price
volatility and increased risk premia. These changes may also induce investors to rebalance their
portfolio, generating market segmentation and information acquisition in seemingly unrelated
economies. Information regimes may persist over time, requiring large improvements in
fundamentals to return to more stable bond spread conditions.

Introduction

The behavior of sovereign debt markets is challenging to understand, particularly
during crises with spiking bond yield spreads. This leads us to examine a novel
source for these crises: changes in the information about sovereign default risk acquired by the agents that lend to these sovereigns. Along with this, we consider a
novel mechanism for contagion: shifts in the information regime in one country may
generate incentives for investors to reallocate funds and acquire information in other
countries, thereby altering the pricing of default risk globally. In this framework,
small shocks to fundamentals in one country can trigger waves of information acquisition in other countries, generating endogenous market segmentation and sharp
increases in bond yield volatility in seemingly unrelated countries.
Sovereign risk premia frequently exhibit sudden fluctuations without obvious changes
in underlying fundamentals. They may also react differently to a given change in fundamentals at different points in time. Nevertheless, there seems to be history dependence in the borrowing conditions faced by different countries: the same change in
fundamentals can have different effects in different countries, and these differences
are persistent over time. Indeed, a given country’s past behavior seems to matter
for how sovereign spreads react to changes in current fundamentals. (For discussion
and documentation of these facts see Reinhart, Rogoff, and Savastano (2003), Tomz
and Wright (2007), Broner, Martin, and Ventura (2010), Tomz and Wright (2013) and
Aguiar and Amador (2014)).1
Aguiar et al. (2016) document that there are several important common components
that drive sovereign spreads globally. However, they find that only a limited share
of these components can be accounted for by global financial factors or changes in
the risk-free rate. These large and largely unexplained common components suggest
some form of contagion. Indeed, sovereign debt crises tend to be highly correlated
across countries and sovereign spreads (the sovereign’s cost of external funding) tend
to co-move strongly. The most recent example is the 2010 debt crisis in Europe, but
similar forces were at play in the wave of debt crises initiated by Poland in 1981,
Mexico in 1994, Thailand in 1997, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2001.2

There is a large quantitative literature that seeks to account for sovereign spreads and defaults; see
for example Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), Arellano (2008), Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012), Hatchondo
and Martinez (2009). Aguiar et al. (2016) surveys this literature.

For the recent European crisis, Beirne and Fratzscher (2013) use information on 31 advanced and

Previous work has attempted to explain contagion by appealing to different types of
linkages between countries. One branch of the literature focuses on real linkages. For
example, trade in goods or financial assets between countries may transmit negative
shocks from one country to the next and lead to co-movements in sovereign spreads.
A second branch of the literature focuses on belief linkages through learning and herding. In this view, contagion is driven by the correlation of beliefs about fundamentals
in different countries, so that bad news about one country make investors pessimistic
about other countries. Of course, a prerequisite for belief correlation to cause contagion is that observations about one country hold information about other countries.
This again requires correlation in fundamentals across countries, or the existence of a
common unobservable variable linking all countries. Finding evidence for structural
linkages across countries is therefore crucial in providing support for the many theories of contagion that rely on them. Problematically, however, it is often difficult to
empirically identify linkages that are plausibly powerful enough to induce the degree
of contagion observed in many debt crisis episodes.
This in turn lead to a third set of explanations that rely on self-fulfilling debt crises either through feedback effects as Calvo (1988) and Lorenzoni and Werning (2013), and
rollover problems as in Cole and Kehoe (1996), Aguiar et al. (2015), and Bocola and
Dovis (2015). Aguiar et al. (2016) consider a one-country model and report that it is
surprisingly difficult to explain the large amount of volatility we observe in sovereign
spread data by including self-fulfilling debt crises. To explain contagion, this literature requires a correlated structure of sunspots to induce simultaneous roll-over crisis
episodes in many countries at the same time.
These deficiencies in the literature motivate us to explore another novel form of linkages between countries that stem not from country fundamentals (the demand side)
but rather from the investment and information acquisition decisions of investors (the
supply side). To the extent that investors are exposed to several countries sovereign
bond risk, changes in one country’s fundamentals induce a portfolio reallocation that
can naturally spill over to spreads in another country. A reenforcing factor is the
change in information acquisition. An investor may have more incentives to obtain
information about the country suffering the change in fundamentals, making its bond
prices more volatile as a reflection of more information. This may lead investors withemerging economies and find that there was a sharp and simultaneous increase in sovereign spreads
in both European and non-European countries. For a survey of previous crises see Reinhart and Rogoff
(2009).

out information to reduce their exposure to this additional price risk, moving funds to
a different country, which alters their incentives to acquire information about those
other countries. This information spillover channel reinforces the simple portfolio
reallocation channel.
We examine the potential of this new portfolio-information channel in a model of
sovereign bond markets with multiple countries and two key elements. First, there is
a global pool of risk-averse investors who freely allocate funds across sovereign bond
markets. Second, these investors can choose to produce information about countries’
fundamentals at a cost. This information is valuable because informed investors can
use it to outbid uninformed investors in particularly attractive states of the world. In
equilibrium, this benefit is exactly offset by the cost of becoming informed.
Our first result is that the flow of capital across countries can generate contagion in
spreads even in the absence of any real linkages, correlation of fundamentals, or belief
updating about one country due to equilibrium outcomes in another country. Specifically, when investor preferences exhibit prudence (that is, u000 (c) > 0, as is the case
for CRRA utility functions), an increase in the probability of default in one country
increases sovereign spreads for all sovereign bonds held by the investor. This is because an increase in the default risk of a given country increases the background risk
inherent in the entire portfolio of sovereign bonds, and thereby reduces the investor’s
appetite to invest in sovereign debt more generally. Hence, sovereign bond prices fall
across in all countries when one country becomes more likely to default. If this effect
is sufficiently large and the increase in spreads is severe enough, it may no longer be
feasible for countries to roll over their debt, causing a wave of debt crises.
This basic contagion result relies only on investor prudence and the fact that there
is a common pool of investors for all countries. Hence it does not rely on changes
in investors’ wealth (as in Kyle and Xiong (2001) or Goldstein and Pauzner (2004)),
borrowing constraints (as in Yuan (2005)) or short-selling constraints (as in Calvo and
Mendoza (1999)). Indeed, contagion stems only from the portfolio rebalancing of
prudent investors in response to an increase in the riskiness of a subset of investment
assets. Broner, Gelos, and Reinhart (2004) provide empirical evidence about the importance of portfolio effects for contagion, while Lizarazo (2013) and Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013) discuss the importance of risk aversion for explaining the
behavior of sovereign spreads.
Our second result is that the option to produce information about countries’ funda4

mentals can generate multiple equilibria. In particular, an uninformed equilibrium
in which no investor acquires information about the country’s fundamentals may
co-exist with an informed equilibrium in which some investors do acquire information about the country’s fundamentals. These information regimes have real effects:
taking as given the stochastic process for fundamentals, the average level and the
volatility of spreads differ across regimes. In the uninformed equilibrium, spreads
are stable and low on average, because investors are relatively insensitive to fundamental variations that they are uninformed about. In the informed equilibrium, in
contrast, spreads are volatile and high on average, because investors are informed
about fundamental variations and strongly react to their realization, demanding high
risk premia in bad states of the world. For this reason, sovereigns strictly prefer an uninformed equilibrium to an informed equilibrium. The same is true for investors, because information acquisition is costly and information rents stem from rent-seeking
at the expense of other investors. That is, the informed equilibrium is Pareto-inferior
to the uninformed equilibrium whenever they co-exist. 3
The second result magnifies the first result, as changes in fundamentals not only
induce contagion in sovereign spreads but also in information regimes. Take two
countries. When fundamentals in Country 1 change and induce information acquisition, any investors who remain uninformed about Country 1 reallocate funds towards
Country 2 (segmentation) and away from sovereign bonds (due to higher background
risk). As those investors become more exposed to Country 2, however, they have
stronger incentives acquire information about Country 2. As a result, more information in one country induces segmentation and thereby spurs information acquisition
in other countries. Instability, then, can also be contagious. This is our third key result. The finding is consistent with Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2010), who
show that information acquisition may lead to segmentation and further incentives
to acquire information, rationalizing features deemed as anomalous in asset markets.
In our paper the source of information incentives is quite different, as it relies on
how countries raise funds and it applies to contagion of the mean and volatility of
sovereign spreads. As in Calvo and Mendoza (2000), moreover, we highlight the role
3

This result is driven in part by the fact information does not affect any real production or allocation decisions in our setting. Accordingly, there are no real benefits of information. More generally,
of course, information may have benefits in terms of disciplining governments or allocating funds to
productive investment opportunities. We assume away those benefits to focus on the forces behind
information acquisition. Any real benefit of information will naturally make the uninformed equilibrium less desirable.

of information on sovereign crises. In contrast to them, however, our emphasis is on
the contagion of information acquisition incentives. This also differentiates our work
from Fostel and Geanakoplos (2008), who provide a theory of price contagion across
asset classes that is based on leverage.
An important upshot from our analysis is that, because investors’ optimal portfolio choice and the information regime jointly determine the mapping from country
fundamentals to sovereign bond spreads and crises, there need not exist a unique
mapping from economic fundamentals to spreads in sovereign bond markets even
in the absence of roll-over crises driven by coordination failures. Indeed, since investors choose their portfolio by taking the fundamentals and information regimes in
all countries into account, the mapping from fundamentals to prices in one country
depends on equilibrium outcomes in all other countries. To the extent that a given
pool of investors prices sovereign bonds in multiple countries, understanding contagion and default risk therefore requires a “global” view of bond markets.
Finally, to the extent that informational regimes are persistent (in that there is a change
in regime if the only if the old regime can no longer be sustained), only large changes
in fundamentals can force transitions across regimes. This refinement, which is conservative in that it restricts the frequency of transitions to those that are strictly necessary, implies that a country starting out in an uninformed equilibrium begins to
attract informed investors only if its fiscal situation worsens substantially, while a
country starting out in an informed equilibrium must improve dramatically to discourage informed investors. In the absence of large shocks, two countries may therefore face different informational regimes and spreads even when their current fundamentals are similar. As a result, a country’s past sins or virtues may be important
determinants of current borrowing conditions. This hysteresis in spreads implies that
understanding contagion and default requires a “historical” view of bond markets.
We begin by studying a single-country model in Section 2. We show how information acquisition can generate equilibrium multiplicity and discuss its effects on bond
yields. In Section 3 we extend the results to two countries, and discuss contagion
through the portfolio channel and the information spillover channel. In Section 4
we interpret the dynamics of sovereign spreads in the recent European debt crisis
through the lens our model. Section 5 concludes. All proofs are in Appendix A.

A Single Country Model

2.1

Setting

Environment: There are two periods, t = 1, 2. The economy is populated by a government and a unit mass of investors. Investors receive an endowment of wealth W
in the first period and derive utility from consumption c in the second period. Their
preferences over consumption are ordered by a strictly concave utility function u(c)
that satisfies the Inada conditions. In the first period, investors decide whether to
invest in a safe asset that has gross return 1 (storage) or in risky debt issued by the
government.
The government is risk-neutral and has legacy debt D coming due in period 1. This
debt is owed to previous investors outside of the model. The government has no
income in period 1, and receives stochastic income Y in period 2. The government
must roll over the debt in period 1 in order to service its creditors. We assume that it
does so by issuing pure-discount bonds using a discriminatory price auction.4 In this
auction, investors specify combinations (possibly menus) of prices P and quantities B
of bonds that they wish to purchase. The government sells debt to the highest bidder
until it either exhausts the bids or sells enough to roll over its debt. If the government
cannot roll over its debt then it must default on initial investors, a situation we call a
debt crisis.
In period 2, the debt issued in period 1 comes due, and the government decides
whether to service the debt using income Y or to default. If the government defaults
in either period, it can abscond with (1 ✓)Y in income, where ✓ 2 [0, 1] is the cost of
default in terms of lost income. We assume that this cost of default is independent of
whether the government defaults in period 1 or period 2. The government’s objective
is to maximize its second period consumption. Since the government is just seeking
to roll over its debt during the first period, it will always do so if it can, reserving the
decision to default for the second period.
While the realization of Y is drawn in period 2 from a distribution F (Y ), the realization of ✓ is drawn in period 1 from a discrete distribution with S elements ⇥ =

Brenner, Galai, and Sade (2009) show that a majority of countries in their sample of 84 countries
use discriminatory auctions to sell bonds. Their sample includes 83% of OECD countries. Our pricediscriminating auction works in a similar fashion to limit order books in markets intermediated by
brokers/dealers; see Parlour and Seppi (2008) for a discussion of limit orders.

{✓1 , .., ✓S }, such that ✓1 > .. > ✓s > .. > ✓S . The realization of ✓ is unknown to both
the government and the investors in period 1. Investors can choose to learn the realization of ✓ in period 1 at a utility cost K. Or, they and the government can wait
until it revealed for free in period 2. Since the emphasis of our paper is on the strategic behavior of investors in terms of acquiring information. We therefore abstract
from the government acquiring information about ✓ and strategically signaling this
information through its behavior.
Auctions: We now describe the auction market used by the government to raise funds
in period 1. While investors are ex-ante identical, they may end up being either
informed or uniformed depending on whether they choose to acquire information
about ✓ or not. We denote by n 2 [0, 1] the fraction of informed investors and by P
the marginal price of government debt in period 1.
When there are informed investors, this marginal price will depend upon the realized
✓ because informed investors condition their bids on ✓. In this case, we denote the
marginal price by P (✓). Without loss of generality, we take as given that informed
investors always offer the marginal price P (✓) in state ✓, and summarize their bidding
behavior by the (conditional) quantity that they wish to purchase at that price, B I (✓).
The uninformed traders instead may find it advantageous to bid a menu of pricequantity pairs. That is, given the set of potential marginal prices {P (✓1 ), ..., P (✓S )},
they choose the quantities to bid at each one of these prices. Let B U (✓) denote the
amount that an uninformed trader bids if he chooses to bid at price P (✓). Whether
the uninformed end up purchasing the bonds they offered to buy ultimately depends
on which state of the world is realized. Specifically, the uninformed bids’ are accepted
whenever they offer a price that is above the realized marginal price.
Taking as given that the government can roll over its debt in period 1, the auction
arrangement leads to the following government budget constraint for each ✓.

The first term on the left-hand side is the informed investors’ bond purchases. The
second term on the left-hand side is the uninformed investors’ bond purchases, taking
into account that their bids are accepted whenever they offer to buy bonds at a price
above the realized marginal price P (✓).

If the government does not default in period 2, its payoff in period 2 is Y R(✓). If it
does default in period 2 its payoff is (1 ✓)Y . This leads to a simple cut-off rule: the
government defaults in period 2 if and only if Y < Ȳ (✓), where
Ȳ (✓) ⌘

(2)

Given this default rule, the realized return to an investor on each bond is 1 if Y
Ȳ (✓)
and 0 otherwise, and the bond’s default probability is 1 Pr Y
Ȳ (✓) . So long as
the total amount of debt coming due, R(✓), is weakly decreasing in ✓ (the higher the
cost of default, the higher the price of debt and the less debt comes due in period
2) the default cut-off is strictly decreasing in ✓ and the default probability is weakly
decreasing in ✓. That is, defaults are less likely when the cost of default is high. A
lower default probability in turn decreases the total bond issuance required to roll
over the debt, which is again consistent with lower rollover costs and prices.
Short-sale prohibition: We assume that private investors cannot short the government’s bond. We do so for two reasons. First, shorting the bond is not equivalent to
pledging to deliver a unit of the bond at a later date. Rather, it requires committing
to the same state-contingent payoff profile as the government. But in order to do this,
the private investor would need access to exactly the sort of commitment technology
as the government (taxation and non-anonymity, for example). Second, only the uninformed may have an incentive to short-sell the bond in any equilibrium with both
informed and uninformed investors, as the informed can always buy bonds at the
correct marginal price. The counterparty to a short-sale attempt by the uninformed
must therefore be an informed investor. But an informed investor is only willing to
9

buy the bond when it is weakly underpriced. The very fact that an offer to short-sell
is accepted would therefore reveal information that the state of the world is such that
the uninformed would not want to short-sell at the relevant marginal price in the first
place. Hence there is no scope for short-selling in our setting.
We now turn to describing investors’ decision problems in detail.
Investors’ problem: An informed investor knows ✓ and takes the marginal price of
debt P (✓) as given. The maximization problem is thus

Finally, the decision to become informed must be consistent with individual optimality. That is, if an interior fraction n 2 (0, 1), of investors chooses to become informed,
10

investors must be indifferent between becoming informed and staying uninformed.
If there are no informed investors, then it must be weakly preferred to remain uninformed. If there are no uninformed investors, then it must be weakly preferred to

We now formally define the equilibrium.
Definition 1 An equilibrium consists of a set of cut-offs Ȳ (✓), prices P (✓), quantities for
the informed and uninformed (B I (✓) and B U (✓) respectively) and a fraction of informed investors (n) such that the following conditions are satisfied.
1. The bond market clears in the first period for each state according to (1), unless P (✓) =
0, Ȳ (✓) = 1 and there is a debt crisis in state ✓.
2. The cut-offs Ȳ (✓) satisfy the threshold condition (2).
3. The choices of B I (✓) and B U (✓) are solutions to the informed and uniformed investors’
problems (first-order conditions (4) and (6), respectively).
4. The fraction of informed investors n satisfies the indifference condition (7). The country
is in an informed equilibrium when n > 0 and in an uninformed equilibrium when
n = 0.
There are a variety of equilibria. This is in part because the price of government debt
affects the likelihood of repayment, which can in turn rationalize different prices of
debt. For example, no-lending with P (✓) = 0 and Ȳ (✓) = 1 for all ✓ is always an
equilibrium. At a zero price the government will not be able to rollover its debt and
therefore must default, this in turn rationalizes the zero price. This multiplicity is
well-known since the work of Calvo (1988) and Cole and Kehoe (1996). Next we
present a simplified special case to characterize the other (potentially multiple, because
of information acquisition) equilibria in a tractable and intuitive way.
Simplifications: To illustrate the key forces determining the pricing of debt and the
decision to become informed, we make the following simplifying assumptions. First,
11

there are two possible costs of default (S = 2). That is, ✓ 2 {✓L , ✓H } with 0 < ✓L <
✓H < 1. We say that ✓H is the “good state” and ✓L is the “bad state,” with Pr(✓H ) = a and
Pr(✓L ) = 1 a. Second, we assume that there are three possible income realizations
in period 2: Y 2 {YL , YM , YH }, with YL < YM < YH and (YL ) = x and Pr(YM ) = z.
Finally, we assume that the parameter values for ✓, Y and prices are such that default
cutoffs are always independent of changes in prices. This assumption allows us to
focus on the direct effects of price changes on information acquisition, abstracting
from the indirect effect through changes in default probabilities induced by the same
price changes. Formally,
Assumption 1
YL < Ȳ (✓H ) < YM < Ȳ (✓L ) < YH
Given this assumption, we can focus on two possible states of the world. When the
cost of default is high, the country only defaults when the income is low, which implies a default probability of H ⌘ x. We call this the “good state.” When the cost
of default is low, the country only repays when the income is high, which implies a
default probability of L ⌘ x + z. We call this the “bad state.”
Assumption 1 concerns both exogenous and endogenous variables since it depends
on the bond prices P (✓L ) and P (✓H ). Its advantage is that fixes the period 2 default
probabilities and allows them to be treated parametrically. It will become clear that a
more general setting in which falling bond prices lead to higher default probabilities
would further strengthen the channels we highlight. We therefore choose to treat
default probabilities parametrically so as to cleanly discuss these channels. Moreover,
we show that endogenous information acquisition is sufficient to generate multiple
equilibria even when default probabilities are fixed and there is no feedback from
prices to default.

2.2

Characterization of Equilibria

We now characterize equilibrium in our baseline setting. We begin by studying the
uninformed equilibium in which no investor acquires information about the state of
the world. Next, we study the informed equilibrium in which some investors decide
to become informed about the state of the world. Finally, we describe that informed
12

and uninformed equilibrium may co-exist, giving rise to equilibrium multiplicity, and
show how changes in fundamentals can trigger switches across equilibrium types.
2.2.1

Uninformed Equilibrium

Define the expected probability of default as

b ⌘ ax + (1

a)(x + z).

Since there is no information about the country’s state, there is a single marginal
price P = P (✓) for all ✓. Given this price, the first-order condition (4) pins down the
demand for bonds B as
u0 (W + [1 P ]B)
=
u0 (W P B)

The next proposition characterizes how this demand reacts to changes in parameters.
Proposition 1 The investors’ demand of sovereign bonds is decreasing in the price of the
bond P and its expected default probability 
b.
Substituting the government’s budget constraint P B = D into (8) implies that the
equilibrium price P ⇤ is defined by

(9)

Proposition 2 A debt crisis in the first period (this is, P ⇤ = 0) is always an equilibrium. If
there exist equilibria with P ⇤ > 0, then the equilibrium price in the highest-price equilibrium
decreases with the probability of default 
b and with the country’s debt D.
The comparative statics for the maximum sustainable equilibrium price are intuitive.
The price falls if an increase in the probability of default reduces the demand for the
sovereign bond, and when an increase in total debt increases its supply. The first
panel of figure 1 shows these effects on demand and supply for the sovereign bond.

The second panel of figure 1 shows the right hand side of equation (9) in black and
the right hand side in different colors for three different levels of D/W . As before,
the equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of the two curves. The higher
is the relative indebtedness of the country, the higher is the left hand side and the
smallest the price P in equilibrium. When D/W is large enough, the only feasible
equilibrium is a P ⇤ = 0 and there is a debt crisis.
In our setting, information acquisition is a choice. As a result, an uninformed equilibrium is sustainable only if no single investor has an incentive to pay the utility cost K
to become informed. Because no individual agent’s bidding behavior impacts equilibrium prices, the benefit of acquiring information in the uninformed equilibrium is
the ability to make optimal state-contingent bids at the fixed marginal price P ⇤ .
Naturally, an investor wants to buy more bonds when he learns that the state is good.
This is immediate from the first order condition (8) evaluated at P ⇤ and H , as the
optimal quantity is decreasing in the probability of default H < 
b. Accordingly, he
would like to buy less bonds when he learns that the state is bad.
Formally, the expected benefits from acquiring information gross of the information

The expected gross benefits of acquiring information are (i) increasing in z, (ii) nonmonotonic in a and (iii) increasing in D/W . To see why, note that the difference
between the optimal informed bid in each state and the optimal uninformed bid (that
is, B(s , P ⇤ ) B(b
, P ⇤ )) is increasing in the absolute difference s 
b. Since 
b H =
(1 a)z and L 
b = az, this difference increases with z. Second, the absolute
difference is maximized at intermediate levels of a. In the extremes, when a = 0 or
a = 1, U (B(L , P )) = U (B(b
, P )) and U = 0. Finally, the larger D/W the larger
the investors’ exposure to the risky asset. These higher stakes increases the benefit of
knowing the probability of default in each state.
2.2.2

Informed Equilibrium

We now turn to characterizing the informed equilibrium in which a strictly positive
fraction of investors acquires information.The critical difference to the uninformed
equilibrium is that the informed equilibriums feature as many marginal prices as
states of the world because informed investors make state-contingent bids. In this
sense, the existence of informed investors thus changes the structure of the equilibrium.
Given that there are two states of the world, we have two prices: PL ⌘ P (✓L ) and
PH ⌘ P (✓H ). We can then rewrite the first order condition (4) as
u0 (W + [1 Ps ]BsI )
=
u0 (W Ps BsI )
(1

Ps  s
Ps )(1

s )

(10)

where s 2 {L , H } are the expected probabilities of default in each state s and Ps 2
{PL , PH } are the prices in each state s.
The next proposition describes the properties of the informed investors’ demand for
15

sovereign bonds in each state. The results are analogous to Proposition 1 in our discussion of the uninformed equilibrium.
Proposition 3 The informed investors’ demand of sovereign bonds in each state s is decreasing in the price of the bond Ps and its expected default probability s .
The crucial distinction between investor types is that the uninformed must post the
same (menu of) bids for each state of the world. Because the auction is discriminatory,
any bids submitted at the high-state marginal price PH will thus also be accepted in
the low state where the realized marginal price is PL < PH . If the uninformed do
not submit any bids at PH instead, they fail to purchase bonds in the high state. This
exposes the uninformed to sources of bidding risk: (i) the risk of overpaying in the
low state, and (ii) the risk of failing to participate in the high-state.
Formally, we can rewrite the uninformed investors’ first-order condition (6) for the
low-price bid BLU as
PL L u0 (W

(12)

These conditions reflected the aforementioned overpayment risk in that the uninU
formed investors end up purchasing BH
no matter the state. The next proposition describes general properties of the total expenditures on sovereign debt by uninformed
investors vis-a-vis those of the informed.
Proposition 4 Compared to informed investors, uninformed investors spend more in the bad
state and less in the good state.
The intuition for this result is as follows. On the one hand, uninformed investors
U
BH
overpay for a fraction B U +B
U of the debt that they purchase in the bad state. If unL
H
informed investors were to spend the same amount as informed investors in the bad
16

state, they would incur the same losses as the informed in case of default but receive
smaller gains in case of repayment. The marginal benefits of spending more in the
bad state are thus larger than the marginal costs, which induces the uninformed to
spend more than informed in the bad state. On the other hand, the uninformed must
spend whatever they spend in the good state in the bad state as well. As they are
overexposed to sovereign debt in the bad state, they would rather reduce their exposure in the good state when compared to informed investors.
U
I
Since BH
< BH
, it may be the case that uninformed investors find it optimal to bid
nothing at the high price (or indeed would want to short the high-price bond if doU
ing so were feasible). We refer to the set of parameters under which BH
= 0 (that is,
parameters under which the short-selling constraint binds and uninformed investors
refrain from bidding for the high-price bond), as the partial participation region. ConU
versely, we refer to the set of parameters under which BH
> 0 as the full participation
region.

In the partial-participation region, the uninformed can infer that the state of the world
must be low whenever their (low-price) bids are accepted. As a result, they can bid
on the low-state bond as if they were informed about the probability of default, and
U
thus bid the same as informed investors. This follows directly from setting BH
=0
in the first-order condition (11) and comparing it with (10). All information rents in
the partial-participation region thus stem from informed investors’ buying bonds in
both states of the world. In the full-participation region, these participation rents are
augmented by price rents because the uninformed buy at the high price no matter
the state of the world.
We analyze the impact of information acquisition in two steps. First, we take the
fraction of informed investors n to be exogenous, and show how information rents
and prices vary with n. Next, we endogenize n by exploiting a free-entry condition
that states investors must be indifferent between being informed and uninformed.
For a given n, prices in each state are determined by equalizing total demand with
with the supply of sovereign bond D in both states. The government budget constraints for the high and low state, respectively, are thus

(13)

and
nPL BLI + (1

U
n)[PH BH

(14)

In Figure 2 we illustrate how the prices PH and PL depend on the fraction of informed
investors n in the economy. As a reference point, we also plot the bond price in
uninformed equilibrium PU . The economy is in the full-participation region when
n < 0.7, and transitions to the partial-participation region when n 0.7.
Proposition 5 The good state price, PH , increases with the fraction of informed investors, n.
This is straightforward to see from equation (14). Since informed investors demand
more than uninformed investors in the good state, an increase in the mass of informed
investors boosts total bond demand in this state. PL typically decreases with n, but
this is not as straightforward to show. There are two competing effects at work. On
the one hand, informed investors demand less in the bad state than uninformed investors, which pushes down prices. On the other hand, an increase in PH can in
principle increase the total demand from the uninformed, as they now buy a fraction
of their low-state bonds at this higher price.
In the partial participation region instead, PL is independent of n. The reason is that
the uninformed now operate under de-facto symmetric information, and so both investor types behave symmetrically. In contrast, PH continues to increase in n because
a larger mass of informed investors pushes up demand and prices in the good state.
Indeed, this cannibalization effect among informed investors leads PH to grow faster
than in the full-participation region.
The partial-participation region begins when n is large because the price gap PH
PL is larger when there are more informed investors. A larger price grap in turn
exposes uninformed investors to more overpayment risk. As the gap grows, this
force becomes sufficiently strong so as to deter the uninformed from bidding at the
high price entirely.
Figure 3 depicts the utility of informed investors (U I ) and uninformed investors (U U )
in the informed equilibrium as a function of n. For reference, we also plot investor
utility in the uninformed equilibrium in blue. Investor utility does not vary directly
with n. Instead, the effect of increased information operates through prices.

Several features are worth noting. First, the utility of informed (uninformed) investors in the informed equilibrium gross of the information cost is always above
(below) the utility of investors in the uninformed equilibrium. This does not imply,
however, that informed investors are better-off in the informed equilibrium, since
they have to incur utility costs to become informed in the first place. Once we account for these costs, the relevant utility level for all investors is that of uninformed
19

investors. Critically, investor utility is lower in the informed equilibrium than in the
uninformed equilibrium because information is costly to acquire and only serves to
extract rents from uninformed investors. Second, the utility of both informed and
uninformed investors decline with n. The reason is that a higher fraction of informed
investors pushes up prices in the aggregate and reduces the rents earned by all investors.
To complete the characterization of the informed equilibrium, we now impose the
free-entry condition that investors are indifferent between becoming informed and
remaining uninformed to pin down the equilibrium fraction of informed investors.
In Figure 4 we plot the utility gap between investors U I (n) U U (n). The point of
intersection with the information cost K defines n⇤ . The utility gap may be nonmonotonic in n, giving rise to two informed equilibria: one with relatively low n⇤ and
one with relatively high n⇤ . Whenever this is the case, we always focus on the latter
because (i) it is the only stable informed equilibrium, and (ii) only stable informed
equilibria exist when the utility gap is strictly decreasing in n. Taking this restriction
as given, we now discuss the forces that determine the shape of the utility gap.
Sources of information rents. There are two kinds of information rents: participation rents and price rents. Participation rents accrue because the informed buy more
bonds in the good state, and bonds are always priced such that investors earn inframarginal rents on their purchases. Price rents accrue because the informed buy bonds
bU = B U + B U
at the marginal price PL in the bad state, while the uninformed
buy
L
H
L
⇣ U⌘
⇣ B
⌘
U

b
bonds in the bad state at a higher average price PL = BbU PH + BbU PL . This avL
L
erage price is large and close to PH when uninformed investors bid heavily at the
U
high-state price, i.e. when BH
is large relative to BLU .
Suppose first that we are in the full-participation region where the uninformed buy
bonds in both states. Information rents depend on n as follows. When there are few
informed investors and n is small, uninformed investors must participate heavily
in the good state to clear the market. As a result, the portfolios of the two types
are similar in the high state, and participation rents are small. On the other hand,
uninformed investors buy a large fraction of their low-state bonds at PH rather than
PL , and so price rents are large because PbL is close to PH .

How do these information rents evolve as n grows? We showed above that an increase in n leads to an increase in PH . This hurts both types of investors, and leads
to a reduction in bond purchases in the good state. Yet the speed at which portfolios
20

adjust is asymmetric. The uninformed reduce their purchases of good-state bonds by
more than the informed because (i) they end up purchasing the high-priced bonds in
both states of the world, and (ii) higher PH means that the price gap PH PL at which
the uninformed overpay in the low state is increasing. This disproportionate retreat
from the good state leads to increased participation rents.
Next, consider the effects of an increase in n on price rents. There are three forces.
First, an increase in n leads to a reduction in PL because the uninformed spend more
in the low state than the informed. This price reduction benefits both groups of investors, but differentially so. Holding the uninformed’s portfolio fixed, a widening
price gap PH PL leads to increased price rents. Yet precisely because the uninformed
adjust their portfolio optimally, growing PH and falling PL induce the uninformed to
reallocate funds away from the high-price bond. Because the uninformed only get to
buy at PL whenever the state is indeed bad, they can buy low-state bonds as if they
were informed. As a result, the uninformed’s low-state portfolio grows closer to that
of the informed. At the margin, this effect allows the uninformed to benefit disproportionately from falling PL . The effect is reinforced by the fact that the gap PbL PL
falls endogenously as the informed shift their purchases to the bad-state bond and
the weight on the high-state price PH falls. As a result, there are reduced price rents for
the informed.
The net change in utility gap after an increase in n is then determined by the relative
change in participation and price rents. Net increases in the utility gap are more likely
when the informed retreat from the good state more slowly, as the bad-state portfolio
of the uninformed remains sufficiently different from that of the informed and price
rents shrink slowly even as participation rents increase. Moreover, the utility gap is
more likely to be increasing when n is small, as small n necessitates heavy participation of the uninformed in the high state, and thus sufficiently different low-state
portfolios.
The utility gap in the full-participation region may therefore display an inverted-U
shape whenever price rents decline slowly, but is strictly decreasing in n when price
rents fall sharply. The non-monotonicity is more likely for large D and low z, because
both contribute to a slower retreat of the uninformed from the high state: higher D
increases the infra-marginal rents earned by both types of investors by depressing
price levels, and makes withdrawing from the good state more costly; lower z means
that the high-state bond is less overpriced because the default probabilities in the two
21

states are relatively transparent.
The forces shaping the utility gap are particularly transparent in the partial-participation
region. Because the uninformed buy bonds at the correct marginal price in the low
state and do not buy any bonds in the high state, their low-state portfolio is the same
as that of the informed. As a result, there are no price rents. Yet there are large participation rents because the uninformed do not participate in the high-state at all. At
the same time, partial participation means that the uninformed are insulated against
high-state price increases. Increases in n therefore do not lead to a further reallocation of funds away from the good state and accordingly do not boost participation
rents. Instead, price increases in the high state now only hurt the informed, leading
to a cannibalization of rents among the informed. In the partial-participation region,
increases in n thus unequivocally lead to a reduction in the utility gap.
2.2.3

Multiplicity

We now show that uninformed and informed equilibrium can coexist. Figure 4 depicts an example where there is a unique informed equilibrium (i.e. the utility gap
is strictly decreasing), and this informed equilibrium co-exists with an uninformed
equilibrium. That is, the utility gap in the informed equilibrium is exactly equal to
the cost of information ( I = K) at some n⇤ > 0, but the gains from becoming informed in the uninformed equilibrium do not outweigh the costs ( U < K).
The economic force underpinning this multiplicity is that the fundamental benefit of
becoming informed is the ability to buy the bond at the right marginal price in all
states. For this reason, the value of information depends on how different marginal
prices are across states of the world. In an uninformed equilibrium, prices are independent of the state of the world. A newly informed investor can thus only adjusts
quantities, but earns no rents from buying at the correct marginal price. An informed
equilibrium instead features an endogenous price gap PH PL > 0 that the newly
informed investor can exploit: in addition to adjusting quantities, he also no longer
overpays for the bond in the low state. The very presence of informed investors thus
boosts the incentives for further information acquisition by generating a price rent
that can be exploited at the expense of uninformed investors.
We now discuss the comparative statics of equilibrium outcomes with respect to
fundamentals, and show how shocks to fundamentals can trigger switches from in22

formed to uninformed equilibrium and vice versa. Specifically, we analyze changes in
the countries’ debt burden and default probability. Default probabilities can increase
in three ways: an increase in the probability of a mediocre output z, an increase in
the probability of a bad output x, and an increase in the probability of a bad state, a.
Naturally, the ultimate source of the shock will have different implications for price
levels, volatility and information acquisition.
We focus on analyzing an increase in z (a reduction in the probability of a high income
realization and an increase in the probability of a mediocre realization). This change
induces an increase in the gap between default probabilities in the low state (H = x)
and the high state(L = x+z) by boosting the default probability in the low state only.
It thus represents an increase in the country’s downside risk. Because the focus of our
paper is on crises events, we therefore view changes in z as the key comparative static
of interest. Figure 5 shows how the set of possible equilibria changes in response to
an increase in z from zlow = 0.15 to zhigh = 0.195 .
The solid lines represent zlow = 0.15. The dotted lines zhigh = 0.195. We find that an
increase in the probability of default driven by an increase in z leads to more information acquisition. The intuition is that information is more valuable when there is
more variation in default probabilities across states. In the uninformed equilibrium,
an increase in z boosts the individual incentives to acquire information so as to buy

less of the bond when the default probability is x + z (low state) rather than x (high
state). That is, U increases. In this numerical example, this effect is large enough for
the uninformed equilibrium to become unsustainable. In the informed equilibrium,
increases in z grow the utility gap through its effect on price rents because the uninformed overpay by more when z is large. As a result, n⇤ must increase to equalize
returns. We obtain a similar result when we compare two levels of indebtedness: an
increase in per-capita debt D/W also increases the incentives to become informed in
both equilibria. The intuition is that higher debt levels force investors to hold a larger
fraction of their assets in risky debt, increasing the value of not overpaying for the
bond. Figure 6 depicts these results graphically by plotting the equilibrium fraction
of informed investors n⇤ as we vary z and D/W . Note that these two mechanisms
naturally reinforce each other in a more general model in which default probabilities
endogenously increase when increased indebtedness erodes bond prices.
Figure 7 plots the uninformed-equilibrium price PU and the informed-equilibrium
prices PH and PL as a function of z (evaluated at the equilibrium fraction of informed n⇤ at each fundamental z). The graph features three distinct regions. When
z is low, there are low incentives to acquire information and only the uninformed
equilibrium is sustainable. When z is high, there are large incentives to acquire information and only the informed equilibrium is sustainable. Both equilibria coex24

bonds bought at the high price, shows that the informed equilibrium is not only characterized by higher price volatility, but also by a lower average price E(P ). While
more informed investors boost the price in the good state, the bad-state price falls
disproportionately as the high marginal utility of wealth in a default state depresses
investor’s risk appetite. Accordingly, Figure 8 shows that the government’s average
debt burden is also higher in the informed equilibrium. That is, not only is increased
information acquisition harmful to investors, it also hurts the government’s fiscal position.
Remark on robustness. We emphasize that the co-existence of informed and uninformed equilibrium does not rely on the fact there are precisely zero informed investors when no investor spends resources to become informed. In particular, the
same forces persist even in the presence of a (small) fraction of exogenously informed
investors n. While the presence of these investors would generate an exploitable price
gap even in the “uninformed” equilibrium, this gap would be smaller than the one
in an informed equilibrium in which an additional mass of investors endogenously
acquires information. As a result, there continues to be a “burst” in the the value of
information so long as utility gap is initially increasing in the total mass of informed
investors. We have shown this to be the case as long as the uninformed retreat from

informed equilibria above, the “uninformed” equilibrium with exactly n exogenously
informed investors would be an unstable informed equilibrium, while the informed
equilibrium with additional endogenous information is stable.

26

2.2.4

Persistent Information Regimes and Bond Price Hysteresis

The equilibrium multiplicity characterized above has implications for interpreting
how shocks to fundamentals affect a country’s debt burden, as well as the volatility
that countries experience in their sovereign spreads. Consider a simple and plausible equilibrium selection rule: a country remains in a given equilibrium (informed or
uninformed) as long doing so is sustainable, but switches when it must. This “conservative” equilibrium selection greatly restricts the role of multiplicity, but necessarily
introduces history dependence, or hysteresis, in that two countries with the same current fundamentals may face different bond prices, debt burdens, and volatility only
because their past was different.5 Such a rule also implies that small changes to fundamentals may sometimes lead to large price changes, while at other times they do
not, and that some countries may have to undergo dramatic fiscal consolidations in
order to benefit from a move to an uninformed regime, while those who have been
less profligate in the past are given more leeway.
These results are also relevant in interpreting the mapping from fundamentals to
sovereign debt prices. Periods of relative calm in bond prices do not necessarily
imply that fundamentals are calm, as it may be that the country raises funds in an
uninformed equilibrium in which prices are relatively insensitive to fundamentals.
In contrast, turbulent periods do not necessarily imply that fundamentals have become much more turbulent than normal, as it may be that the country transitioned to
an informed equilibrium in which prices are more sensitive to movements in fundamentals.

2.3

Information Rents in the Presence of Secondary Markets

Our analysis above assumes that government bonds are only traded once upon their
issuance. In practice, of course, government bonds typically trade in deep and liquid
secondary markets that dynamically incorporate investors’ private information. This
raises the question of whether informed investors can still earn information rents
in the presence of such markets. To address this issue, we introduce a secondary
market in which investors competitively trade government bonds bought during the
primary market. This secondary market takes place after the primary market has
5

A history-dependent selection criterion is formally proposed and solved by Cooper (1994).

27

closed, but before the government makes its default decision. To account for the fact
that any private information held by investors during the initial auction may have
been incorporated into prices or otherwise revealed, we assume that the state of the
world ✓ is publicly observed prior to the opening of the secondary market, but after
the closing of the primary market. This information structure implies that secondary
market prices and quantities are state-contingent. We denote the secondary market
prices in state ✓ 2 {L, H} by ⇢✓ . We relegate the full analysis to Appendix B and
focus here on discussing informally the main implications of secondary markets for
the robustness of our previous results.
We show that, even with secondary markets, there exist informed equilibria in which
informed investors earn rents that exactly offset the cost of acquiring information.
Moreover, the presence of secondary markets may exacerbate the price volatility in
primary auctions, and with secondary markets there may exist informed equilibria
that are not sustainable without secondary markets. The benefits of information in
a setting with secondary markets arise from differences between primary and secondary market prices. This differential allows informed investors to capture arbitrage profits by buying low in the primary market and selling high in the secondary
market, with the price gap endogenously determined to exactly deliver the required
rents. The next proposition formalizes this basic insight
Proposition 6 In any informed equilibrium (n⇤ > 0) the high-state primary market price
is lower than the high-state secondary market price (PH < ⇢H ), while the low-state primary
market price is equal to the low-state secondary market price (PL = ⇢L ).
Informed investors thus earn arbitrage profits because there are price differences
across primary and secondary markets conditional on the state. Compared to the
model without secondary markets, information rents thus consist purely of price
rents rather than participation rents, as the uninformed always end up holding bonds
even when they do not purchase any in the primary market. Uninformed investors
thus “pay” for the ability to make state-contingent bids by buying in the high-price
secondary market, while informed investors pay for this ability directly by buying
information.
The degree of arbitrage is modulated by two endogenous variables: the fraction of
informed investors n and the primary market price PH . Informed investors always
28

fully exploit the arbitrage opportunity and buy as many primary market bonds as
I
possible: BH
= PWH . The total supply of bonds in the secondary market is thus limited
only by the wealth and mass of the informed investor pool. That is, arbitrage rents are
decreasing in n because an increase in bond supply depresses prices. An increase in
the primary market price in turn decreases arbitrage rents in two ways: by lowering
the price gap ⇢H PH and by reducing the number of primary market bonds each
informed investor can afford to buy.
The extension thus shows that, even in the presence of secondary markets whose
prices convey information about ✓, there are incentives to acquire information as long
as investors do not have access to unlimited arbitrage capital. Furthermore, these
incentives may indeed exacerbate in occasions multiplicity of equilibria, contagion
and volatility of prices.

Two-Country Model

So far we have studied the role of information in determining the funding conditions for a single country. We now extend the model and study two countries that
raise funds by issuing debt to the same unit mass of investors. For simplicity, we abstract from secondary markets and assume that both countries are characterized by
the same stochastic structure for income Y and default costs ✓, albeit with possibly
different parameters.
Our analysis is in two steps. First, we study the two-country problem in the absence
of information acquisition. We show that negative shocks to one country’s fundamentals increase spreads in both countries through a portfolio reallocation effect as
long as investors exhibit prudence (u000 (c) > 0) . Second, we introduce endogenous information acquisition and show that there are complementarities across countries in
the incentives to acquire information. This leads to a second form of contagion based
on information regimes: shocks that induce local information acquisition may trigger
global information acquisition, generating increased sensitivity to fundamentals and
higher volatility in both countries.
We use the following structure to maintain tractability in our two-country setting.
First, we assume that every investor is a household consisting of two members, each
29

of whom is assigned to participate in the bond auction of one particular country. Second, auctions in both countries take place simultaneously, and the investor must split
its wealth across its two members prior to the auctions. Third, each household member can acquire information about the country it has been assigned to, but members
cannot communicate this information to each other prior to the auction. As a result,
each member’s bids are not explicitly contingent on the bids of the other member.
Household members can, of course, coordinate on an information acquisition strategy ex ante.
These assumptions allow us to simplify the analysis by restricting the number of equilibrium prices. If all bids were contingent on the realization of the state and bids in
the other country, each investor would have to optimally choose bids at J 2 potential marginal prices in each country, where J is the number of possible states of the
world. Moreover, these optimal bids would be globally linked through the first-order
conditions of uninformed investors, greatly complicating the demand system. Our
structure reduces the number of marginal prices and bids to J in each country, but
preserves the essential features of a two-country setting: investors must make a portfolio choice about which country to invest in, and the optimal portfolio and information acquisition choices depends on the information environment in each country.

3.1

Contagion Without Information Acquisition

We start by analyzing the two-country model without information acquisition in
which both countries are in the uninformed equilibrium. Note that no-informationacquisition is always an equilibrium of the model with endogenous information for
sufficiently high information costs. This case turns out to be a fairly straightforward
extension of the one-country uniformed equilibrium. Since there are now three possible assets (storage, country 1’s bonds and country 2’s bonds) the household’s maximization problem is

The next proposition shows that, when u satisfies constant relative risk aversion
(CRRA), an increase in the expected default probability in one country reduces the
sovereign price in the other country. This result holds despite the fact that bond returns in each country are i.i.d and there is no feedback other than through portfolio
reallocation. The reason is prudence (u000 > 0): the “background risk” introduced
by increased default risk in one country induces investors to hold less risky assets
overall, depressing bond prices globally.
Proposition 7 There is contagion (i.e.

@Pi
@b
 i

< 0) when preferences are CRRA.

Because contagion relies on prudence, the magnitude of contagion is increasing in
1
the degree of prudence. For the CRRA utility function u(c) = c1 , the coefficient
of relative prudence is (1 + ). To understand how prudence affects spillovers, we
now specialize the first-order condition (17) to country 1, and ask how changes in
country two’s default probability ̂2 affect country 1’s bond price for various levels
of . Figure 9 graphically depicts the first-order condition. The red and blue lines
depict its left-hand side, consisting of the ratio of marginal utilities across default and
no-default in country 1. Because the investor holds both bonds, this ratio generically
depends the default probability in country 2. Blue represents ̂2 = 0.3, while red
represents ̂2 = 0.7. The black line depicts its right-hand side, which is independent
of and ̂2 .
We find three results. First, the larger prudence (and, thus, risk aversion), the lower
the bond price for any ̂2 . Second, the larger ̂2 , the lower the bond price, for any
31

given . Third, the larger prudence, the sharper the fall in country 1’s bond price upon
an increase ̂2 . In other words, the sensitivity of country 1 to country 2’s fundamentals
is increasing in the degree of investor prudence.

Contagion on the Informational Regime

We now turn to endogenous information acquisition with two countries. Given that
household members do not share acquired information prior to bidding, the set of
marginal prices in country i is independent of ✓j , the realized default cost in country j.
We denote the marginal price in state of the world j in country i by Pij , and investors’
bids at this price in state ✓i by Bij (✓i ). The investor’s terminal wealth, or consumption,
in state s = (✓1 , ✓2 , Y1 , Y2 ) is

(15)

where Pr{s} denotes the probability of state s. The net utility of the investor is (15)
if he does not acquire information in any country, (15) minus K if he acquires information in one country, and (15) minus n
2K if he acquires
o information in both. The
investors’ decision problem is to choose {Bij (✓i )}j=1,2
to maximize (15). Given
i=1,2

that information is endogenous, investor bids must satisfy the measurability constraint
Bij (✓j ) = Bij (✓j 0 ) for all j and j 0 .
(16)

for any country i in which the investor did not acquire information. This condition
ensures that investors bid the same amount in states of the world that they cannot
distinguish.
We focus our analysis on demonstrating how the presence of informed investors in
one country shapes the incentives to acquire information in the other country. To do
so, we construct the value of becoming informed in four different types of equilibrium, and ask how this value varies with the global information environment. Whenever possible, we focus on symmetric equilibria in which the number of informed and
the set of marginal prices is the same in both countries. As a result, the value of information is also symmetric. Such symmetric equilibria naturally exist when the country’s fundamentals are identical, which we assume throughout. Figure 10 depicts our
results graphically by plotting the value of information as a function of n.
The first case we consider is the uninformed equilibrium in which no investor acquires information in either country. As a result, there is a single marginal price in
each country that is identical across countries. The value of becoming informed is the
increase in utility obtained by a single new informed investor who takes as given that
UU
no other investors are informed about any country. We denote this value by IU
UU
and depict it in blue.
The second case is an equilibrium in which there are informed investors in the “home”
country, but we exogenously impose that no investor acquires information about the
“foreign” country. In this asymmetric equilibrium, there is a single price in the foreign country, and two state-contingent prices in the home country. We compute the
incentives to acquire information by comparing the payoffs of investors who are informed about the home country to those who are not, taking as given that no investor
is informed about the foreign country. We denote the information incentives in this
UU
equilibrium by IU
and depict it in black.
IU
33

The third case we consider in Figure 10 is a symmetric equilibrium in which n  0.5
investors are informed about the home country, a further n investors are informed
about the foreign country, but no investor is informed about both countries. Given
that both countries are symmetric and fundamentals are i.i.d, the marginal benefit of
acquiring information in one country is higher than that of acquiring information in
the second country. As a result, no investor will acquire information in both countries until all investors are informed about at least one country. There are now two
marginal prices in each country, and these state-contingent price are identical across
countries. We compute the incentives to acquire information by comparing the utility
obtained by those informed in one country and those informed in neither. We denote
UU
this value by IU
and depict it in solid green.
II
Once n = 0.5, all investors are informed about one of the two countries, with exactly
0.25 investors informed about each. For n > 0.5, we therefore construct the symmetric
equilibrium in which n 0.5 investors are informed about both countries, and n 20.5 of
investors are each informed about one of the two countries. That is, all investors are
informed about each country, and some investors are informed about both. As beIU
fore, there is an (identical) set of two marginal prices in each country. II
, plotted
II
in dashed green, shows the incentives to acquire information in the second country
by comparing the utility obtained by investors informed in both countries to that of
investors informed in only one country.
Finally, the solid red line depicts K, the per-country cost of acquiring information.
We find that the incentives to acquire information in one country are strictly higher
when there are informed investors in the other country than when there are not. The
intuition is as follows: as long as there is a country without informed investors, uninformed investors can invest in the uninformed country without running the risk of
buying the bonds at the wrong marginal price. The uninformed country thus acts as
a “safe haven” by providing the opportunity to buy bonds without price risk. This
dulls the uninformed’s incentives to acquire information. When there are informed
investors in both countries instead, the remaining uninformed investors cannot avoid
paying excessive prices in some states of the world if they want to buy bonds, increasing their incentives to acquire information. The existence of informed investors thus
begets further information acquisition.
We present an example in table 1 to show how the information environment shapes
the individual investor’s portfolio allocation. To do this, we fix the number of in34

vestors who are informed about country 1 at 1/4 of the total. We consider two cases
with respect country 2: no one is informed about this country and 1/4 of the total
investors are informed about it. This example corresponds to n = 0.25 in figure 10,
hence note that no investor is informed about both countries.
In the first part of the table we compare the total expenditures of an informed investor
in the country in which he is informed to the expenditures in the country in which
he is uninformed, as a fraction of his total wealth W . In the second part we make a
similar comparison for an investor who is uninformed in both countries. The table
illustrates several stark patterns. First, while the informed investors always tilt their
investments toward the country they are informed about, this tilting is much stronger
when the other country is also in the informed equilibrium (from 30.5% to 36.7%).
Moreover, the reduction in their investment in country 2 (where they are uniformed)
when there are informed investors also in country 2 (from 19.3% to 8.3%) is so strong
that their overall average investment in risky bonds falls (from 49.8% to 45.0%).
When we look at the investment expenditures of investors who are uninformed in
both countries, we see that they too tilt their investments away from a country which

is in the informed equilibrium. This leads them to invest more in a country without
informed investors (11.0% in country 1 as opposed to 20.2% in country 2 where no
investor is informed) and to invest symmetrically invest in both countries (9% in each)
when there are the same fraction of informed investors participating. However, in the
second case, the uninformed have very sharply reduced their average expenditures
on risky bonds (from 31.2% to 18%).
The concentration of investment by the informed increases the benefits they gain from
becoming informed. At the same time, as uninformed investors will shrink their participation in risky sovereign bonds as there is more information lowers their welfare
and increases the relative gains from becoming an informed investor. These forces
contribute the extent of cross-country information complementarities.
Figure 10 illustrates the strength of this equilibrium cross-country information complementarity. We choose the cost of information K to be such that, conditional on no
investors being informed in the foreign country, only the uninformed equilibrium is
sustainable. That is, no investor acquires information about the home country at cost
K when no investor is informed about the foreign country. If instead we allow for
endogenous information acquisition in both countries, a symmetric informed equilibrium exists in addition to the uninformed equilibrium. In this particular example,
the informed equilibrium is such that 20% of investors are informed about both countries and the remaining 80% are informed about exactly one country. The scope for
information acquisition in both countries thus boosts the degree of equilibrium information acquisition. We have already shown that information is reflected in higher
spreads, debt burdens, and volatility. The cross-country information complementarity result we establish thus immediately leads to important implications for the
contagion of sovereign debt crises: a switch to an informed equilibrium in one coun36

try may be enough to trigger information acquisition globally, raising the specter of
rising yields and default risk.

The impact of this mechanism on investment segmentation is corroborated in Figure 11. We plot the equilibrium bids of an investor who has acquired information in
country 1 but not 2, in the symmetrically informed equilibrium in which n⇤ investors
are informed about one of the two countries and 1 2n⇤ investors are uninformed
about both. The black line depicts the investor’s bids at the high marginal price in
country 1 (the country in which he is uninformed), while the red line depicts his bids
at the low marginal price in that country. For comparison, the blue line depicts the
bids of an uninformed investor in the uninformed equilibrium. All bids are plotted
as a function of z1 = z2 , the increment in the bad state’s default probability. The investor optimally invests less in the country in which he is uninformed when other
investors are informed about this country. An increase in z1 , which leads to to an increase in information acquisition incentives and, thus, n⇤ , only strengthens this effect.
Investors thus tend to invest more in the country in which they are less informationally disadvantaged, and the fact that they concentrate their holdings further boosts
information acquisition incentives. These forces can be sufficiently strong that these
37

investors invest exclusively in the country in which they are informed.

An illustration Based on the European Debt Crisis

We now illustrate our model’s mechanism using the recent European Debt Crisis. Figure 12 shows that European sovereign bond yields exhibited substantial heterogeneity prior to the 1999 introduction of the Euro, but were stable and remarkably similar
for almost a decade thereafter. A divergence of bond yields sets in with the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing Irish banking crisis. This divergence
intensifies during 2010 and 2011 (during the so-called “Greek sovereign crisis”), with
yields rising sharply for some countries (notably Greece, Ireland and Portugal), and
declining for others (notably Germany, France and Netherlands). This “fanning out”
of European bond yields stopped right after Mario Draghi’s proclamation that the
ECB ”...is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will
be enough.” Since then, the yields of most countries started a process of convergence.

One explanation of this pattern is that bond yields closely reflect sharply diverging
fundamentals after the 2008 global crisis, substantially deteriorating in countries like
Greece and Ireland but improving in Germany, France and the Netherlands. Another
explanation is that fundamentals did not diverge substantially, but that the sensitivity
of yields to fundamentals increased, for example due to more private information
acquisition.
To capture these explanations we run the following simple OLS regression

fundamentals we include are the yearly change of real GDP per capita, GDPit and

the outstanding level of public debt over GDP, GDP
. We allow for country and
it
year fixed effects, and for the possibility that the sensitivity of yields to fundamentals
changes during crises. We capture this concern by the indicator Ic , which is equal to
1 for the crisis years 2009-2013.
The regression results show that the the first explanation is partially correct, as GDP
growth and debt over GDP are significant variables explaining the evolution of yields.
Yet the second explanation plays a role as well, as the sensitivity of yields to GDP
growth and debt over GDP increase significantly during the crisis. Yet even together,
the explanatory power of fundamentals declines during the crisis, as evidenced by

out.7 More specifically, the standard deviation of the regression errors increased by
a factor of three during the crisis when compared to normal times. Consistent with
these results, Bocola and Dovis (2015) find that standard empirical models that tend
to capture the evolution of yields in normal times are not able to accommodate their
dynamics during the recent European sovereign crisis. This implies the divergence
cannot be explained by the observed behavior of the usual fundamentals alone.

may be due to increased private information acquisition by investors. Indeed, both
the larger sensitivity to observed fundamentals and the larger errors from a regression
based on those fundamentals can be rationalized by our model when one country
suffers a shock that triggers a switch to a global informed equilibrium.
To see this, imagine a situation with seven countries with different z levels, which
can be interpreted as the inverse of the GDP growth (the larger the GDP growth, the

lower the expected probability of default for the country). Imagine also that during
normal times these countries are all in an uninformed equilibrium. In Figure 14 this
is captured by the seven green dots having a sovereign price according to pU . As can
be seen, prices are not very sensitive to fundamentals and can be perfectly explained
by the observed fundamental z (in this extreme there would be no errors if running a
regression as the one above).

Imagine now that the country with the largest z (or the smaller GDP growth)
has a
negative, relatively small, shock that reduces its GDP growth even more. The uninformed equilibrium becomes unsustainable for such a country, and investors begin
acquiring information about its economy. Cross-country complementarities in information acquisiton then imply that investors may find it optimal to also learn about
countries that were not directly hit by the initial shock. As a result, Figure 14 may
change to Figure 15.

In Figure 15, the five countries with the lowest GDP growth (highest z) have moved
to an informed equilibrium. Sovereign bond prices now reflect information not only
about z but also about ✓, which is not publicly observable and is not included in the
regression. Indeed, information acquisition in our model may well involve learning
about non-public shocks to variables that may not always be relevant for bond yields,
such as the political cost of default, the health of the domestic financial institutions,
or the exposure of domestic banks to certain assets. This has two implications. First,

for some countries information about ✓ is “positive” (✓H or high cost of default)
and
their price will be pH > pU . For other countries, information about ✓ is “negative” (✓L
or low cost of default) and their price will be pL < pU . This immediately implies that
any regression model that uses standard publicly observable data to explain yields
will have more errors during a crisis than in normal times, as there are variables not
observed by the econometrician that enter into the pricing of debt.

Second, since average price is lower in the informed equilibrium than in the uninformed equilibrium, having more countries in the informed equilibrium makes the
sensitivity of prices to fundamentals z larger. Specifically, the relevant coefficient is
represents the average effect on the blue pU faced by uninformed countries, and the
purple E(p) faced by informed countries.
Moreover, our analysis of the two-country model shows that increases in information
acquisition and default risk lead to the segmentation of investor portfolios, and to
higher debt burdens overall. This is consistent with the evidence in Battistini, Pagano,
and Simonelli (2013) and Cipollini, Coakley, and Lee (2015), who show that there was
increased segmentation in the European sovereign market during the crisis period.

Conclusions

This paper constructs a simple model of portfolio choice with information acquisition
in which a global pool of risk-averse investors holds sovereign debt issued by a number of different countries and information about some determinants of default are not
easily observable and costly to acquire.
For a single country we have shown that the participation of informed investors (informed equilibrium) is more likely when the country is highly indebted and when
there is more certainty about its fundamentals. An equilibrium in which a country
raises funds from informed investors is Pareto-inferior, as investors obtain less utility
and the country faces higher yields, bond price volatility, and debt levels.
Given that an informed and a uninformed equilibrium may coexist, small changes
in fundamentals can generate large changes in realized spreads and debt burdens.
If the selection of equilibrium is history-dependent (the country remains in a given
equilibrium as long as this equilibrium is sustainable) then the sovereign price of
two countries with the same fundamentals but different past may be substantially
different.
Once we allow for many countries, there are two important sources of contagion.
On the one hand, contagion of sovereign debt prices does not require fundamental
linkages or common factors, just a common pool of investors that react to changes
in fundamentals of each country and rebalance the portfolio. On the other hand, the
information regime is also contagious, as one country moving to an informed equilibrium increases the incentives to acquire information about other countries, even in
the absence of economies of scale to acquire information.
Our results show why it is not straightforward to interpret changes in sovereign debt
prices as informative about the country’s fundamentals, as they depend not only on
publicly observable fundamentals but sometimes also on fundamentals that are not
easily observable, as they depends not only on the country’s own fundamentals but
also on other countries’ fundamentals, as they depend not only on the country’s informational regime (and thus, potentially on past fundamentals) but also on other
countries’ informational regime.
We have highlighted the main forces behind information acquisition and the mapping from observable and non-observable fundamentals to sovereign debt spreads,
43

but did not focus on their quantitative power. However, there are many reasons why
we may expect these forces to be also quantitatively relevant. Just to mention a few
magnifying forces: First, an endogenous probability of default that responds to bond
prices itself would mean that small changes in information would have dramatic effects on prices and default risk. Moreover, there would also be a feedback effect across
countries: an exogenous increase in default probability in one country induces a reduction of prices in several other countries, increasing the probabilities of default in
all those countries, further reduction of prices, and so on. Second, fundamental linkages across countries naturally magnify contagion. Third, time varying prudence, for
example because of time varying risk-aversion or time varying wealth, would magnify contagion and informationa acquisition during crises. Fourth, market segmentation can concentrate contagion in certain regions, buffering others. Finally, how a
shock in a country changes the informational equilibrium in other countries depend
on the structure of the costs to acquire information: if a country attracts informed
investors and then makes it cheaper for them to acquire information about other similar countries, then it is more likely that those other countries also attract informed
investors.

An equilibrium price P ⇤ satisfies F (P ⇤ |b

b,
F (P = 1 

Proof of Proposition 6: Begin with the high-state prices. Suppose for a contradiction
that PH
⇢H . PH > ⇢H cannot be part of an equilibrium since all investors would
prefer to wait and buy bonds in the secondary market. If PH = ⇢H , uninformed investors strictly prefer to wait for the secondary market so as to make state-contingent
bids once ✓ is revealed. We have already seen that uninformed investors can always
make state-contingent bids on the low-state bond, since they only get to buy at PL
when the state of the world is indeed low. Conditional on PH = ⇢H , individual optimality then dictates that the uninformed buy the same portfolio as the informed, and
obtain the same gross utility. This is a contradiction with n⇤ > 0. Now turn to the
low-state prices. We have already argued that both uninformed and informed can
make state-contingent bids at PL . Thus if PL 6= ⇢L , all investors would either prefer
to buy in the secondary markets only, or to buy in the primary market and sell in the
secondary market. In both cases, market clearing fails. Hence PL = ⇢L . Q.E.D.

This condition holds because the relative change in the gains from bidding in country

Appendix: Extension to Secondary Markets

In this appendix we augment the baseline one-country model to include a secondary
market stage. Secondary market trading occurs after the initial bond auction (primary
bond market) but before the bonds pay out (default decision).
We take as given that all investors learn ✓ prior to the secondary market, and denote
the associated state of the world by subscript s 2 {L, H}. Let ⇢s denote the secondary
market price in that state, and let Bsi and bis denote the primary and secondary market
state-s bond purchases of agent type i, respectively. Let Xsi denote agent i’s total
primary market expenditure on bonds in state s, and let B̂si denote agent i’s total
bond holdings at the beginning of the secondary market in that state. As the state of
the world is revealed prior to the secondary market, we can analyze the secondary
market state-by-state, conditional on the primary market bond purchases by each

50

agent. To this end, define the following variables:
Wsi = W

Xsi

W̃s = nWsI + (1

n)WsU

B̃s = nB̂sI + (1

n)B̂sU ,

where Wsi is the amount of safe assets that the agent enters the state-s secondary
market with and the latter two variables represent aggregate safe assets and bond
holdings in that state.

B.1

Optimal Secondary Market Bids

In each state s, agent i’s secondary-market objective is to maximize:
⇣
⌘
uis = s log Wsi ⇢bis + (1 s ) log Wsi + B̂si + (1 ⇢)bis ,

where s denotes the default probability in state s. Taking first-order conditions with
respect to bis yields the secondary market demand function
bis =

Wsi (1

⇢s s ) s ⇢B̂si
⇢s (1 ⇢s )

(18)

The secondary market clearing condition is
nbIs + (1

n)bUs = 0

Accordingly, the market-clearing secondary market price is
⇢⇤s =

(1 s )W̃s
,
W̃s + B̃s

and is pinned down by agents’ aggregate beginning-of-period bond holdings. Secondary market quantities are
⇤

bis =

(W̃s + s B̃s )(B̃Wsi W̃s B̂si )
W̃s (W̃s + B̃s )

(19)

B.2

Informed Equilibrium with Secondary Markets

From Proposition 6, prices must satisfy ⇢H > PH and ⇢L = PL . High-state price differences across primary and secondary market allow the informed to capture arbitrage
rents that rationalize their information cost. We now construct equilibria that satisfy
these conditions. As before, let n > 0 denote the fraction of informed investors.
Begin by considering the optimal portfolio of an informed investor. Since ⇢H > PH
and the informed can buy bonds state-by-state, every informed investor will buy as
I
many bonds as possible in the high state. That is, BH
= W/PH and so WHI = 0. As a
result, the secondary market demand of an informed investor is bIH = (1 ⇢HHW)PH . The
informed’s high-state secondary market supply is this strictly increasing in ⇢H and
strictly decreasing in PH . Given that there are no low-state price differences between
primary and secondary market, the informed are indifferent between buying in either
market. Indeed, the first-order condition (18) pins down the total demand in the low
state: bIL + BLI = WP(1L (1PLPL)L ) . We will later allocate this demand across primary and
secondary markets so as to satisfy market clearing in both.
We now turn to the decision problem of an uninformed investor, taking as given that
PL⇤ = ⇢⇤L . We begin by specializing the indirect utility functions given above to the
case of the uninformed investor. Start with the low state. Because the uninformed
purchase the high-price bonds they bid for in every state of the world, our definitions
above imply that
WLU = W

U
PH B H

PL BLU

U
B̂LU = BH
+ BLU

⇣
⌘
Simplify notation by defining L ⌘ log (W̃L + B̃L )L W̃L1 L . Then the uninformed’s
secondary market indirect utility function in the low state is:

⇤

uUL = log W̃L W + (1 PH )BH

(1 L )W̃L
W̃L +L B̃L

implies that BLU drops

U
U
uL = log W W̃L + L B̃L + BH (1

L )W̃L

⇣

PH W̃L + L B̃L

⌘i⌘

L

That is, the uninformed’s primary market bids in the low state are irrelevant for their
utility because they can always choose to buy more (or less) in the secondary market
at the same price. Accordingly, as was the case for the informed, the low-state secondary market demand funtion 18 pins down the total amount of bonds purchased
at PL = ⇢L but is silent on whether this is done in the primary or secondary market.
Given that secondary market quantities are chosen optimally, the uninformed’s lowstate utility thus depends only on the amount of primary-market bonds purchased at
U
the high price, BH
.
Next turn to the uninformed’s high-state secondary market indirect utility function.

The first term on the RHS is strictly positive because ⇢H > PH . It follows that the
U
second term must be negative. If not, then BH
= W , which cannot be part of an
equilibrium, because then all agents would be trying to sell in the secondary market.
As a result, we must have PH > ⇢L = PL .
U
There are two cases: (i) an interior equilibrium in which BH
> 0, and (ii) a corner
equilibrium in which the uninformed do not buy any primary-market bonds in the
U
high state, BH
= 0. We now discuss these in turn.

B.2.1

U
Corner equilibrium with BH

Begin by assuming that the uninformed do not buy any bonds in the high-state pri@U U

mary market, BH
= 0. For this to be an optimal choice, we need @B
U |B U =0  0. By
H
H
(22), this condition is
a (⇢H PH )  (1 a) (PH ⇢L ) .
(23)
The uninformed thus do not participate in the high-state primary market whenever
the price gap between primary and secondary market in the high-state is smaller than
the price gap between high state and low state, adjusted for the probability of the high
state.
Suppose that condition (23) indeed holds and the uninformed do not participate in
the high-state primary market. We can then construct the competitive equilibrium in
closed form. First note that the high-state primary market-clearing condition is:
I
nPH BH
= nW = D

which immediately implies that
D
W
⇤
Note that because n is pinned down by market-clearing but PH is not, PH is the free
variable that adjusts to fix the informed’s rents at exactly K.
n⇤ =

In the high-state secondary market, we then have WHI = 0, WHU = W , B̂ I =
B̂ U = 0. This implies that

Hence the secondary-market price is given by:
⇢⇤H =

PH (W D) + H D

(24)

and is strictly increasing in PH .
Next, we want to pin down the primary-market high-state price. We can derive this
price from the utility indifference condition across investor types because, in the corner equilibrium, the uninformed and the informed behave symmetrically in the low
state. All rents thus stem from the high state. The utility of the informed in the high
state is:

Note that PH⇤ is decreasing in K. Moreover, ⇢⇤H > PH⇤ for any K > 0 and the price gap

To complete the equilibrium characterization, we now need to derive the equilibrium price in the low state. As mentioned above, the uninformed’s low-state decision
55

problem is exactly the same as that of the informed. As a result, we must have that
bUL + BLU =

W (1 PL L )
.
PL (1 PL )

Secondary market quantities are thus
bUL =

W (1 PL L )
PL (1 PL )

and

BLU

bIL =

W (1 PL L )
PL (1 PL )

BLI

Guess and verify that the solution is of the form BLI = BLU = BL⇤ and bIL = bUL = 0.
That is, guess that both types of investors choose the same low-state primary market
portfolio and do not trade in the low-state secondary market. Then
b⇤L =

W (1 L PL )
,
PL (1 PL )

and the primary market equilibrium price is
L W
W D

PL⇤ = 1

It follows that WLI = WLU = W PL⇤ BL⇤ and B̃L = BL⇤ . We can use (18) to verify that
bIL = bUL = 0. Moreover, it is then straightforward to verify that ⇢⇤ = PL⇤ as well. This
completes the argument. Note that the low-state price is just the full information price
– which is also true in the partial-participation region of the model without secondary
markets.

We now turn to the case where the uninformed optimally choose to participate in the

high-state primary market, that is BH

then solve for {PL , ⇢H , PH , bL , BL , bH , BH

can reduce this problem to a system of five equations in the five unknowns
U = {PL , ⇢H , PH , BLU , n}.

Given U , we can derive BH
from the first-order condition (22):
U
BH
=

W [a(⇢H PH ) (1 a)(PH

(25)

We can then pin down bUH from (18). Equation (18) also pins down bUL conditional on
BLU . We have therefore pinned down all uninformed quantities given U .

Turning to the informed, we know that BH

Using the secondary market demand functions (18) then shows that all informed
quantities are also pinned down by U . We can then solve for the remaining endogenous variables U using the following five equations:

2. High-state secondary market clearing: nbIH + (1
3. Low-state secondary market clearing: nbIL + (1

Illustration

We now provide an illustration of the equilibrium with secondary markets. To do
so, Figure 16 contrasts primary market prices with and without secondary markets
as a function of z. We use the same parameter values as in Figure 7 in the main text.
Black denotes the high state and red denotes the low state. Solid lines depict the
equilibrium without secondary markets, while dashed lines depict the equilibrium
with secondary markets. The uninformed equilibrium price is in blue.
The illustration shows that the model with secondary markets can give rise to two results. First, primary market prices can be more volatile in the presence of secondary
markets. In our example, the high-state price is higher throughout, while the lowstate price is lower for relatively low values of z. As discussed above, the low-state
price is the same when z is sufficiently large to trigger the partial-participation region
without secondary markets. Second, an informed equilibrium with secondary markets exists even when an informed equilibrium without secondary markets does not
exist. The illustration thus suggests that the advent of secondary market in and of
itself may trigger information acquisition and price volatility. Countries with low z
may therefore be hurt by secondary markets, while countries with high z, who are in
an informed equilibrium regardless, may reap benefits from higher high-state prices
without suffering any downsides.
