Does Falling Smoking Lead to Rising Obesity?
Jonathan Gruber and Michael Frakes
NBER Working Paper No. 11483
July 2005
JEL No. H1, I1
ABSTRACT
The strong negative correlation over time between smoking rates and obesity have led some to
suggest that reduced smoking is increasing weight gain in the U.S. This conclusion is supported by
findnigs of Chou et al. (2004), who conclude that higher cigarette prices lead to increased body
weight. We investigate this issue and find no evidence that reduced smoking leads to weight gain.
Using the cigarette tax rather than the cigarette price and controlling for non-linear time effects, we
find a negative effect of cigarette taxes on body implying that reduced smoking leads to lower body
weights. Yet our results, as ell as Chou et al., imply implausibly large effects of smoking on body
weight. Thus, we cannot confirm that falling smoking leads in a major way to rising obesity rates
in the U.S.

Two of the most noticeable trends in the health of Americans over the past thirty years
are shown in Figure 1. On the one hand, there has been a striking decline in the incidence of
cigarette smoking among Americans; whereas 37.4% of the population smoked in 1970, only
22.5% of the population smoked in 2002. On the other hand, there has been a large rise in the
rate of obesity among Americans over this same time period. The obesity rate for Americans
over the age of 20 has more than doubled from an average rate of 14.6% between 1971 and 1974
to over 30% today (Flegal et al. 2002).1 As Figure 1 shows, while the U.S. used to have more
than twice as many smokers as obese persons, since the mid 1990s there have been more obese
persons than smokers.
Are these trends related? Some suggest so. After all, it has long been believed that
quitting smoking can lead to weight gain. In 1990, the U.S. Surgeon General found that between
58% and 87% of those individuals who quit smoking gain weight and, on average, those who
quit gain 4 pounds more than those who continue to smoke. While there is clear evidence of
short-run weight gains, however, there is little evidence to show a direct link between smoking
and steady state weight. Whether or not there is any merit to the perceived wisdom that smoking
facilitates weight loss, research suggests that many smokers, particularly women, make no
attempt to quit smoking because of fear of ensuing weight gain (Caan et al. 1996)
A large literature documents the welfare gains from reduced smoking in the U.S., both in
terms of external gains to society from lower medical costs, and internal gains to individuals
from living longer. At the same time, a number of recent studies have emphasized the welfare

costs from increased obesity in the United States. Medical expenses attributed to individuals
being either overweight or obese accounted for 9.1 percent of total U.S. medical expenditures in
1998 (Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, and Wang, 2003). Additionally, obesity accounts for an almost
equal amount of indirect costs, mostly due to the reduced productivity resulting from obesityrelated mortality and morbidity (Wolf and Colditz 1998; Wolf 1998). If efforts to reduce
smoking do, in fact, lead to increased obesity among Americans, then the welfare costs
attributable to the expanding obesity problem may offset the public health benefits of the decline
in smoking.
A recent suggestive piece of evidence on the link between smoking and obesity was
provided by Chou, Grossman and Saffer (2004). They showed that higher cigarette prices,
which reduce smoking, are associated with higher rates of obesity. This suggests a direct link
between smoking and weight, and has formed the basis for Rashad and Grossman’s (2004) view
that rising obesity due to falling smoking is an example of “the price that must be paid to achieve
goals that are in general favored by society”.
In this paper, we revisit the question of the impact of smoking on obesity. Using the
same BRFSS data source as Chou et al., we estimate a negative relationship between cigarette
taxes and body weight: higher cigarette taxes lead to lower rates of obesity. Assuming that
cigarette tax effects run only through smoking, this implies that reducing smoking actually
lowers body weight. We can largely explain our differences from Chou et al. by the use of more
complete controls for time trends in smoking, and use of cigarette tax rates rather than potentially
endogenous cigarette prices. One limitation we highlight for both our results and those of Chou
et al., however, is that the findings imply implausibly large effects of smoking on body weight.
Overall, we cannot confirm that higher cigarette taxes will lead to increased obesity.

3

Part I: Background
Smoking and Weight Gain
An extensive medical literature has supported the popular contention that smoking
facilitates weight control. In 1990, the U.S. Surgeon General reviewed 15 medical studies
involving a total of roughly 20,000 test subjects (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
1990). Between 58% and 87% of those who had quit smoking gained weight. On average,
quitters gained four pounds more than those who continued smoking. Individual weight gains of
20 pounds or more following smoking cessation were found to be rare and occur in only 3.5% of
cases.
The followup periods employed in the 15 studies reviewed by the Surgeon General
ranged from 1.5 months to 6 years, with a median followup of 2 years. Several studies, however,
have shown that the rate of weight gain following cessation is transient, slowing down after 6
months in response to a return in energy intake to baseline levels (Caan et al. 1996). The weight
gained prior to this return to equilibrium is generally retained for at least 6 years (Froom et. al.
1999). However, some studies have found that quitters ultimately lose at least a portion of this
initially gained weight (Mizoue et al. 1998). Employing a cross-sectional analysis with data from
periodic health examinations of Japanese workers, Mizoue et al. find that steady state weight
levels for former smokers approach those of never smokers. While heavy smokers may
experience large weight gain and weigh more than never smokers in the few years following
smoking cessation, they will ultimately lose this weight and return to the never-smoking weight

4
levels. Mizoue et al. further find that light or moderate smokers may gain weight following
smoking, but only up to the never smoker levels
Regardless of the merits of the perceived link between smoking and steady-state body
weight, the perception itself is very real. According to numerous studies, the fear of weight-gain
following smoking cessation discourages many smokers from attempting to quit (Caan et al.
1996). The 1986 Adult Use of Tobacco Survey asked current smokers who had tried to quit to
evaluate numerous reasons for the decision to continue smoking (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services 1990). Twenty-seven percent of respondents indicated that “actual weight gain”
was a “very important” or “somewhat important” reason for their decision not to quit and fortyseven percent reported that they agreed with the statement that “smoking helps control weight.”
Thus, aside from any actual connection between weight and smoking, this perception alone may
be contributing to negative outcomes.
Even if there is an effect of quitting smoking on weight gain, researchers frequently stress
that any such effect is small in relation to the significant health benefits from discontinued
smoking. Furthermore, research also indicates that smokers generally exhibit less healthful
behavioral habits. For instance, they consume less fruits and vegetables (particularly those high
in vitamins A and C), high fiber grains, low fat milk, and vitamin and mineral supplements
(Subar, Harlan, and Mattson 1990). According to the 1990 Report by the Surgeon General, some
prospective medical studies report increased physical activity following smoking cessation.
Moreover, the Surgeon General’s Report also notes that any effects from post-cessation weight
gain are mitigated by favorable changes in lipid profiles and body fat distribution.

5
The Decline in Smoking and the Rise in Obesity
The decline in smoking in the U.S. has been one of the major public health victories of
the second half of the twentieth century. After rising rapidly until 1953, cigarette consumption
per capita rose much more slowly until the late-1970s, and then began to decline. The major
determinant is assumed to be changing public attitudes towards the health risks posed by
smoking, beginning with the release in 1954 of information on the health hazards of smoking.
Another contributing factor may have been a slow but steady rise in the real price of
cigarettes during the 1980s. A large literature shows that smoking is sensitive to cigarette prices,
with a consensus elasticity in the range of -0.4 to -0.6.2 From a minimum of 76 cents per pack in
1980 (in $1982), cigarette prices rose to $1.30 per pack by 1992. This period saw the steepest
decline in per capita cigarette consumption, from roughly 2800 cigarettes per capita in 1980 to
2000 cigarettes per capita in 1992. At an elasticity of -0.5, this 70% rise in prices can explain
almost all of the 40% decline in cigarette consumption per capita over this period. Prices then
fell due to a cigarette industry price war in 1993, and were flat before rising again starting in
1997 due to a series of tobacco industry settlements with the states and private litigants.
Smoking was likewise fairly flat in the mid-1990s before declining sharply in the late 1990s.
Over this same time period, the United States has also witnessed considerable growth in
the rate of obesity among both the adult and youth populations. The U.S. Surgeon General has
recently noted that obesity in the United States has reached “epidemic proportions” (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services 2001). Obesity is determined according to the Body
Mass Index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared
2

The review in Chaloupka and Warner (2001) points to -0.4 to -0.45 as consensus estimates, but
recent work has produced higher elasticities, such as in Gruber and Koszegi (2004).

6
(kg/m^2). Those with BMI greater than or equal to 30 are considered obese. BMI of less than
18.5 is considered underweight, while 18.5-25 is normal and 25-30 is overweight. Over the last
several decades, the rate of obesity among U.S. adults has doubled, reaching over 30% today.3
These trends in dietary outcomes are of particular importance to national health policy.
The public health arena has long recognized the connection between dietary behavior and
various health outcomes, including mortality. In 1999, heart disease was the leading cause of
mortality in the United States, amounting to 30.3% of deaths (CDC 1999). Roughly threequarters of these deaths were due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) (CDC 1999). Medical
evidence establishes a strong link between IHD and diet / sedentary lifestyle (Campbell, Parpia
and Chen 1988). All told, experts estimate that obesity contributes to over 300,000 premature
deaths per year (McGinnis and Foege 1993).
The time series causes of the rise in obesity are not altogether clear. Two leading
theories are proposed by Philipson and Posner (1999) and Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro (2003).
Philipson and Posner attribute the rise in obesity to technological change, which has lowered
both the real cost of food and the level of physical intensity in the workplace. In a modern postindustrial society, such as that of the United States today, work tends to be relatively sedentary
and non-strenuous, leading to a reduction in the level of calories expended daily. This
technological explanation helps in interpreting the puzzling observation of rising obesity during a
period of time in which there had been only a modest increase in caloric consumption and a rise
in recreational exercise and dieting.

7
Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro also attribute the rising obesity trends to technological
factors. However, unlike Philipson and Posner who focus on the effect of technology on caloric
expenditure, Cutler et al. propose that technological innovations led to increased food
consumption. The development of microwave ovens and various innovations in food processing,
packaging, and storage have led to a shift in the division of labor in food production. The switch
from individual food preparation within the home to mass food production at centralized
shipping locations led to a decrease in the time cost of food consumption and to an increase in
the quantity and variety of food consumed.

Causal Evidence on the Smoking/Obesity Link
We are aware of only one article in the economics literature which has tried to provide
causal evidence on the smoking/obesity link, Chou et al. (2004). Using micro level data from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (1984-1999), Chou et al. attempt to determine how
much of the trend in obesity is explained by various state-specific factors, including the real price
of cigarettes. Employing state fixed effects and a quadratic time trend, they run a reduced form
model to find an elasticity of BMI with respect to cigarette price (inclusive of state and federal
excise taxes) of 0.025 and an elasticity of the probability of being obese with respect to cigarette
price of 0.445. They conclude that the effect of smoking on body weight does indeed work in the
commonly perceived direction.

Part II: Data

8
Our basic data source for this analysis is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS). The data consists of repeated cross-sections for the years 1984 through 2002, collected
via monthly telephone surveys of individuals aged 18 years and older. The BRFSS is a nationally
representative survey of the United States and has been conducted by state health departments in
coordination with the CDC for the purpose of collecting state-level data pertaining to risky
personal health behaviors. 15 states took part in the first survey in 1984. By 1994, all 50 states
and the District of Columbia became involved. The survey was administered to an average of
817 individuals per state in 1984, rising to an average of 4700 per state in 2002.
The data contain information on respondents’ weight, height, smoking behavior and
survey month, along with various demographic characteristics. Self-reported weights and heights
allow us to calculate the BMI of each respondent, as well as a dummy variable for whether BMI
exceeds 30, the generally recognized classification for obese.
We combine responses from two survey questions to construct an indicator for whether
or not the respondent currently smokes, conditional on having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in
his or her lifetime. The 1984-2000 surveys also contain information on the number of cigarettes
smoked per day, on average, by each reported smoker. With this information we construct the
average number of cigarettes smoked by all respondents (with 0 values for non-smokers).
We match the BRFSS data to monthly cigarette excise tax data from The Tax Burden on
Tobacco (Orzechowski and Walker 2000). To allow a slight lag, we match on the tax rate at the
end of the previous month. We create real excise tax data using monthly CPI measures from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. We also match onto each respondent state-level data on the average
annual real retail price of cigarettes (per pack) from The Tax Burden on Tobacco. Finally, we

9
match onto our data unemployment rates by state, year, and month, obtained from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics4.
An advantage of the BRFSS is that it contains information on both smoking behavior and
body weight/height. Another advantage is that the survey has been carried on for many years
and ultimately across every state. Over the relevant time period, there has been significant
variation in the excise tax rates imposed by the states, in both absolute and relative terms. This
extensive variation allows for identification of the effect of smoking on BMI.
In the analysis below we restrict our sample to those respondents under 65 years of age in
order to ameliorate a possible health bias. Higher cigarette taxes result in reduced smoking,
which in turn results in fewer sick individuals. Since sicker individuals are generally skinnier
than healthy ones, we should expect to find a negative bias in the relationship between smoking
and weight measures due to this general health mechanism. Restricting the sample to those
respondents under 65 should minimize the impact of these more general health factors and focus
our results on those behavioral and metabolic forces of interest.
Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations of the relevant variables in the BRFSS.
These figures are computed based on BRFSS sampling weights and are representative of the
population at large. The BRFSS data are weighted for the probability of selection of a telephone
number, the number of adults in a household, and the number of telephones in a household. To
generate final sample weights, a poststratification adjustment is made to account for other
factors, including the nonresponse and noncoverage of households without telephones. In order

to ensure consistency of our estimates, these sample weights are also employed in our regression
models below (DuMouchel and Duncan 1983).
The average BMI across the sample is 25.8, and 16.8% of the sample is obese (somewhat
lower than the average found in the numerous National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys, as reported in Flegal et al.). Average BMI for smokers is 2.7% lower than that for nonsmokers (25.9 v. 25.2), and the obesity rate is 4% lower for smokers than that for non-smokers
(13.9% v. 17.6%). It is unclear, however, whether or not these numbers suggest a causal link
between decreased smoking and obesity, particularly where these two behaviors are part of a
more complex decision-making process.
Table 1 also reports the means and standard deviations of the cigarette excise tax and
price data. The average state excise tax (in 2002 dollars) across the sample is $0.44, with a
standard deviation of $0.28. The data show a significant variation in excise taxes across states,
within any given time period. The standard deviation of real excise taxes in year 2002 is $0.43
(with a mean of $0.60). About 25% of the variation in excise taxes is within states over time
(Gruber and Mullainathan 2002). The substantial within-state variation in excise taxes will allow
us to identify the impact of smoking on obesity measures while controlling for fixed differences
across states, as well fixed differences across sample years.
Finally, Table 1 also shows the means and standard deviations for the control variables
used in our analysis. Some interesting observations are worth noting. 48% of the sample is male.
Obesity is roughly the same across sexes. However, male BMI’s are an average of 1.2 higher
than females. Reconciling these two results, males are roughly 17% more likely to be in the
“overweight or obese” classification. Males are also more likely to smoke than females (25% v.

11
21%). 27% of the sample has at least a bachelor’s or an associate’s degree. 14% did not complete
high school. 33% have a high school degree or a GED equivalent. Finally, 26% attended some
college or completed a technical degree. Those respondents who have a high school degree or
lesser education have a 5% higher obesity rate and have, on average, a higher BMI (26.1 v.
25.4). They also are roughly 10 percentage points more likely to smoke (28.9% v. 18.3%
smoking rate). These cursory demographic observations suggest caution in inferring a causal
relationship between the smoking and obesity trends.

Part III: Empirical Strategy
We begin our analysis by showing reduced form estimates of the impact of cigarette taxes
on measures of body weight. In particular, we estimate regression equations of the form:
BMIijt = α + β1RTAXjt + β2Xijt + β3URjt + λj + τt + εijt
where i indexes individuals, j indexes states, and t indexes years
BMI is body mass index or some other measure of body weight
RTAX is the real cigarette tax in state j in year t
X are a set of individual-specific covariates (e.g. age)
UR is the unemployment rate in state j in year t
λj and τt are fixed effects for state and year, respectively
This model estimates the impact of cigarette taxes on body weight controlling for fixed
differences in taxes and body weight both across states and over time. In addition, we include
controls for a number of individual characteristics: sex, race, age, income, marital status and
education. In order to control for time-varying economic conditions of the separate states, we
also include monthly state unemployment rates.

12
In this model, therefore, it is changes in cigarette taxes within states, relative to other
states that do not change their tax, that identifies the effect of taxes on body weight measures. Of
course, even this fixed effects specification does not control for all potential threats to causal
estimation of the impact of cigarette taxation on obesity. For example, it could be that states
raise cigarette taxes in times of recession, and body weight goes down (or up) in recessionary
periods. We attempt to control for this in two ways in the estimation below: by including
controls for state economic conditions, and by including state-specific trends in the analysis.

Part IV: Results
Table 2 presents our initial results from estimating equations such as that shown above.
We estimate our model for two different measures of body weight: the level of the BMI (results
are similar if we use the logarithm of BMI instead) and an indicator for obesity (BMI>30). We
express the cigarette tax in fractions of a dollar, rather than cents (e.g. 0.4 not 40) for ease of
interpretation of the coefficients.
Surprisingly, we find that there is a negative relationship between cigarette taxes and
BMI; higher taxes lead to a lower BMI. This finding implies that the reduced smoking due to
higher taxes lowers, rather than raises, weight, although the estimated effects are fairly small.
For example, for BMI, our estimates imply that a $1.00 rise in cigarette taxes would lower BMI
by 0.15, or less than 1% of the sample mean; this estimate is significant. This same $1.00 rise in
cigarette taxes would lower the odds of being obese by 0.015 percentage points, or about 1% of
the sample mean, and the estimate here is more highly significant.

13
Table 2 also shows the coefficients of the control variables used in the initial BMI and
obese regressions. We find a negative and statistically significant relationship between real
household income and BMI, although the estimated effect is quite small, with an implied
elasticity of 0.02. However, the estimated effect of real income on the probability of being obese
is of greater magnitude, with an implied income elasticity of 0.18. We estimate a strong negative
effect of years of education on both BMI and the probability of being obese. The state-specific
unemployment rate has a negative and statistically insignificant effect on BMI and a negative
and marginally significant effect on the odds of obesity.
Blacks, whites, and Hispanics all have higher BMI’s than individuals of other racial
groups, along with higher probabilities of being obese. In particular, blacks have significantly
higher measures of both outcomes. Females have lower BMI’s than males. However, males and
females have roughly equivalent probabilities of being obese. Age follows a non-linear
relationship with both BMI and the probability of obesity, with younger individuals having lower
weight outcomes. BMI and obesity appear to rise with age and then peak in the 50's, thereafter
lowering again for those in their 60's. Married and widowed individuals have higher BMI and
obesity odds than divorced and never-married individuals; divorced individuals, in turn, have
lower weight outcomes than those who have never married.

Comparison to Chou et. al.
These striking “wrong-signed” findings stand in direct contrast to the results of Chou et
al., who found significant positive effects of cigarette prices on body weight. In this section, we

14
reconcile these two sets of findings (thanks to the generosity of Chou et. al. in sharing their data),
over the same 1984-1999 period used by Chou et al.
There are three fundamental differences between our approach and that of Chou et. al.
The first is the sample and control variables used. Chou et al. include all those age 18 and over
(whereas we exclude those over 65 for health reasons), and also control for numerous statespecific measures, including the density of restaurants, fast-food prices, full-service restaurant
prices, food-at-home prices, and clean indoor air laws. The second source of difference is the
treatment of time controls. While we include dummies for every year, Chou et. al. use a
quadratic time trend instead. The third source of difference is the measure of smoking cost. We
use the cigarette tax rate, while Chou et. al. use the state-specific cigarette price.
Table 3 shows the comparison of our results, for BMI and obesity; we show just the
coefficient of interest, that on cigarette price (or tax). We begin by showing the results for Chou
et al. in the first column, and our replication in the second column, which is very close to their
result. In the third column, we change the controls for time, moving from a quadratic trend to a
full set of year and month dummies. Doing so substantially reduces the coefficients of interest,
which are now about half as large, along with the corresponding t-statistics. In the fourth
column, we also replace the cigarette price with the cigarette tax. This has a dramatic effect,
making the coefficients negative and, in the case of BMI, significant. Indeed, as a comparison
with the next-to-last column (which shows our basic specification) illustrates, the results using
year/month dummies and cigarette tax rather than price is very similar to our basic findings.
Both of these changes seem reasonable. Given the available data, and the large
movements in obesity and smoking over time, it is more careful to control non-parametrically for

15
time trends; doing so causes only a very small rise in the standard errors, so there is little loss in
precision. Moreover, while cigarette tax may suffer from political endogeneity, it is clearly a
more exogenous measure than price. Price changes within states are largely driven by tax
changes, but may also be driven by other market factors which affect both the rate of smoking
and eating. For example, suppose there is a demographic shift in a state (e.g. more young
persons) which leads to both more smoking and less eating. Cigarette companies may raises
prices in the face of this increased cigarette demand, leading to a spurious correlation between
cigarette prices and both smoking and body weight.
Robustness to State-Specific Time Trends
One natural concern about using cigarette taxes (or prices) as a regressor is reverse
causality: perhaps taxes (or prices) are reacting to the underlying trends in smoking (and body
weight). To address this concern, we have also included in our model state-specific linear time
trends. These interactions of each state dummy variable with a time trend will pick up generally
increasing or decreasing body weight trends in each state that might be correlated with cigarette
tax (or price) policy.
The final column of Table 3 shows the effect of including state-specific time trends in our
models. The results do not change much at all. This suggests that reverse causality that is
caused by a slow-moving trend in the data is not driving any of our results.

Interpretation
One troubling aspect of both the Chou et al. results and our results, however, is that the
coefficient on the cigarette price/tax seems much too large. Consider the coefficient on cigarette

16
tax/price in the obesity regression. For our basic specification, we find that each $1 rise in
cigarette taxes raises the odds of being obese by 0.015 percentage points. The first column of
Table 4 shows corresponding “first stage” regressions of the odds of smoking on the cigarette tax
in the BRFSS data. We find that each $1 rise in cigarette taxes lowers the odds of smoking by
0.026 percentage points. Thus, as the second column shows, the “instrumental variables”
estimate of the effect of smoking on obesity is enormous: the estimate implies that individuals
who quit smoking are 56% less likely to be obese! Since the Chou et al. results are of a similar
magnitude (but of an opposite sign), the implication is correspondingly large (in the opposite
direction). Such a large effect, in either direction, is clearly implausible and is inconsistent with
the relatively small weight gain discussed in observational studies.
Of course, rising taxes lead individuals not only to quit smoking, but also to smoke less,
and this second effect may also affect body weight. Thus, in the third column, we show the first
stage results using as the dependent variable the number of cigarettes smoked (including zeros
for non-smokers). Here we get a coefficient of -0.726, indicating that each dollar of taxation
leads individuals to smoke 0.7 fewer cigarettes on average. The second stage coefficient in this
case is 0.02, indicating that smoking one fewer pack of cigarettes (20 fewer cigarettes) would
lower the odds of obesity by 40%; this is once again implausibly large.
These results are worrisome in that they indicate an effect which seems too large to be
plausible. One limitation of these findings, however, is that the BRFSS data seem to indicate an
very low price elasticity of cigarette consumption. The overall elasticity is only -0.2, which is
much lower than that estimated with aggregate data (-0.5 to -0.6; see Chaloupka and Warner
(2001) and Gruber and Koszegi (2001)). Part of the reason may be that aggregate estimates

17
include smuggling across state lines, but part of the reason may also be measurement error in
micro-data on smoking.
Yet, even if the true elasticity is -0.5, the implied effect of smoking on body weight
remains surprisingly large. By our estimates, at a true elasticity of -0.5, reducing smoking by a
pack a day would lower the odds of obesity by 15%, which is still a very large effect relative to
the observational literature.

Part V: Conclusions
Smoking and obesity are the two largest (at least partially) self-imposed health risks
facing Americans today. The notion that there is a tradeoff between these risks, with lower
smoking causing more weight gain, is the type of “common knowledge” that has in fact found
relatively little support in the literature. We provide such analysis in this paper and are unable to
detect any evidence that higher cigarette taxes, which lead to lower smoking, also lead to higher
weight. The existing study purporting to find such a relationship is not robust to reasonable
changes to the specification, and neither our approach nor theirs yields results of plausible
magnitudes.
We therefore find, in agreement with the medical literature, that there is no evidence for a
large weight effect from smoking cessation. Our finding does not, however, rule out a moderatesized effect. Future research to ascertain such smaller effects must use research designs which
yield much more precise inferences about the effects of smoking cessation on weight gain.

Notes: T-statistics in parentheses. Standard errors are corrected to allow for grouped error terms at the state level.
The two columns provide the regression results for the two alternative dependent variables employed: BMI and
OBESE (BMI >= 30). Fixed effects for state and month/year combinations employed in all regressions. Only those
respondents under the age of 65 are included in the regressions. Observations in each regression are weighted by the
corresponding BRFSS sampling weight.

Notes: Results correspond to the regression coefficients for the cigarette price (or tax) variable. Column 1 provides
the published coefficients from Chou et al. In column 2, we present the results from our replication of the model
employed by Chou et al.. In column 3, we modify our replication model, replacing quadratic time trends with a full
set of year/month dummies. In column 4, we modify the model used in column 3 to replace cigarette price with
cigarette tax. In column 5, we present the results from our basic model. Finally, in column 6 we add state-specific
linear time trends to our basic reduced form model.
