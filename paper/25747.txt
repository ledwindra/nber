Reflexivity in Credit Markets
Robin Greenwood, Samuel G. Hanson, and Lawrence J. Jin
NBER Working Paper No. 25747
April 2019
JEL No. G01,G40
ABSTRACT
Reflexivity is the idea that investors' biased beliefs affect market outcomes, and that market
outcomes in turn affect investors' beliefs. We develop a behavioral model of the credit cycle
featuring such a two-way feedback loop. In our model, investors form beliefs about firms'
creditworthiness, in part, by extrapolating past default rates. Investor beliefs influence firms'
actual creditworthiness because firms that can refinance maturing debt on favorable terms are less
likely to default in the short-run—even if fundamentals do not justify investors' generosity. Our
model is able to match many features of credit booms and busts, including the imperfect
synchronization of credit cycles with the real economy, the negative relationship between past
credit growth and the future return on risky bonds, and "calm before the storm" periods in which
firm fundamentals have deteriorated but the credit market has not yet turned.

Introduction
Current views about …nancing re‡ect the opinions bankers ... hold about the uncertainties they must face. These current views re‡ect ... the recent past ... A history of success
will tend to diminish the margin of safety ... bankers require ...; a history of failure will do
the opposite.— Hyman Minsky, Stabilizing an Unstable Economy, 1986.

Over the past decade, researchers in …nance and economics have documented a number of
new facts about the credit cycle. High credit growth is associated with both a higher probability
of a future …nancial crisis and lower GDP growth at a horizon of two years (Schularick and
Taylor [2012], López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek [2017], Mian, Su…, and Verner [2017]). Other
research has documented predictability of returns in credit markets, suggesting a role for investor
sentiment in driving the credit cycle. Greenwood and Hanson (2013) show that periods of elevated
corporate credit growth and low average issuer quality forecast low returns to credit. In a large
panel of countries, Baron and Xiong (2017) …nd that high bank credit growth forecasts low
returns to bank stocks.
Another underappreciated feature of the credit cycle is how disconnected it can be from the
stock market or the broader macroeconomy in the short run. In post-war U.S.history, credit
expansions and contractions have often followed a similar pattern. Credit grows slowly as the
economy emerges from a recession, picks up steam, but continues to expand even as the overall
economy cools. For example, in the upswing preceding the 2008 …nancial crisis, GDP growth
peaked in March 2005, but credit growth peaked two years later in March 2007, a period when
credit spreads were at near historical lows. Put simply, the credit cycle seems to have some life
of its own at short horizons. However, these disconnects pose a challenge for most well-known
models of the credit cycle— e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Holmström and Tirole (1997),
Bernanke, Gertler, Gilchrist (1999)— and even for more recent behavioral models like Bordalo,
Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2018). Speci…cally, although credit market frictions amplify business
cycle ‡uctuations in these models, the business cycle and the credit cycle are essentially one and
the same.
In this paper, we present a new behavioral model of the credit cycle that is consistent with
much of the accumulating evidence on credit cycles, but also speaks to periods of disconnect
between credit markets and the fundamentals of the economy. A key feature of our model is
“re‡exivity”, the idea that there is a feedback loop between investors’ biased perceptions and
market outcomes. In …nance, the idea of re‡exivity is most prominently associated with the
investor George Soros, who argued that “distorted views can in‡uence the situation to which they
relate because false views lead to inappropriate actions.” (Financial Times, October 26, 2009).
In credit markets, re‡exivity arises because investors who overestimate the creditworthiness of
1

a borrower are likely to re…nance maturing debt on more favorable terms, thereby making the
borrower less likely to default, at least in the short run.
In our baseline model, a representative …rm invests in a sequence of one-period projects. Each
project requires an upfront investment of capital, which the …rm …nances using short-term debt
that it must re…nance each period. Projects generate a random cash ‡ow that varies exogenously
according to the state of the economy. Debt …nancing is provided by investors whose beliefs are
partly rational and forward-looking, but also partly extrapolative and backward-looking. To the
extent that they are backward-looking, investors extrapolate the …rm’s recent repayment history
to infer the probability that the …rm will repay its debt in the next period. Following periods of
low defaults, investors believe that debt is safe, and re…nance maturing debt on attractive terms.
Because investors hold extrapolative beliefs based on defaults— which are endogenously determined in the model— and not on the exogenously given cash ‡ow fundamentals, this leads
to a dynamic feedback loop between investor beliefs and defaults. The feedback loop arises because current investor beliefs a¤ect future defaults via the terms on which investors are willing
to re…nance debt today.
Figure 1 illustrates this feedback loop. During credit booms, default rates are low, so investors
believe that future default rates will continue to be low. In the near term, these beliefs can be
self-ful…lling: the perception of low future defaults leads to elevated bond prices, which in turn,
makes it easier for …rms to re…nance their maturing debt. Holding constant …rms’ cash ‡ows,
cheaper debt …nancing leads to slower debt accumulation and a near-term decline in future
defaults, which further reinforces investor beliefs. If cash ‡ow fundamentals deteriorate, the
backward-looking nature of investors’beliefs may allow …rms to “skate by” for some amount of
time, a phenomenon that we refer to as the “calm before the storm.” Eventually, the reality
of poor cash ‡ow fundamentals catches up with …rms, and defaults escalate. As a result, the
disconnect between investors’beliefs and economic fundamentals is often the greatest just before
such an spike in borrower defaults.
Conversely, suppose that the economy has just been through a wave of defaults. Since investors over-extrapolate these recent outcomes, investors believe that the likelihood of future
defaults is high. Investor beliefs turn out to be partially self-ful…lling in the short run: bearish
credit market sentiment makes it harder for …rms to re…nance existing debts, leading to an increase in defaults in the short run. In some circumstances, this can lead to “default spirals” in
which a default leads to further investor pessimism and an extended spell of further defaults,
much like what has been observed in instances of sovereign debt restructuring (Das, Papaioannou,
and Trebesch [2012]).
In our model, transitions between credit booms and credit busts are ultimately caused by
changes in cash ‡ow fundamentals. However, because investors extrapolate past defaults and
not cash ‡ows, changes in credit markets are not fully synchronized with changes in fundamental
2

cash ‡ows, and can be highly path-dependent. For example, as noted, our model generates
“calm before the storm” periods in which the fundamentals of the economy have turned, but
credit markets are still buoyant. Such episodes are consistent with Krishnamurthy and Muir
(2018), who show that credit spreads are typically “too low” in the years preceding …nancial
crises. But, because investors are also partially forward-looking in our model, credit spreads will
jump up on the eve of a crisis, just as documented by Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018).
The model is also useful for understanding how credit evolves following an exogenous shock
to investor beliefs. For example, suppose that investors become more optimistic about …rms’
creditworthiness. In this case, …rms are able to roll over debt at more attractive rates, which in
turn makes default less likely in the near term. For an investor looking back at past defaults,
lending to …rms now appears to be even safer, leading investors to become even more optimistic,
further reducing credit spreads. Over time, a shock to beliefs can be self-perpetuating. There is
a limit to this self-perpetuation, however, because ultimately the …rm can become over-leveraged
and default. Moreover, although this feedback loop between expectations and outcomes is always
present, there are times when it is stronger. We describe the conditions under which changes
in investors’ expectations have the most powerful impact on market outcomes: these “highly
re‡exive”conditions often arise when the …rm is near default.
While the credit market investors in our model are not fully rational, their beliefs are often
similar to those of fully rational agents. In part, this is due to re‡exivity: when investors believe
that default probabilities are low, these optimistic beliefs cause default probabilities to be low.
Thus, while the investors in our model do make predictable mistakes, those mistakes need not
be large in order to generate rich and realistic credit market dynamics.
The model matches a number of facts that researchers have documented in recent years about
credit cycles. First, rapid credit growth appears to be quite useful for predicting future …nancial
crises and business cycle downturns (Schularick and Taylor [2012], Mian, Su…, and Verner [2017],
López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek [2017]), a result that is consistent with our model because
outstanding credit will grow rapidly when sentiment is high but cash ‡ow fundamentals are poor.
Relatedly, economies that have experienced high credit growth are more fragile, in the sense that
they are vulnerable to shocks (Krishnamurthy and Muir [2017]). Second, high credit growth
predicts low future returns on risky bonds in a univariate forecasting regression (Greenwood
and Hanson [2013] and Baron and Xiong [2017]), a result that obtains in our model because
investors do not fully understand that when credit is growing rapidly that they are often quickly
heading towards a credit bust. Furthermore, in a multivariate forecasting speci…cation, low
quality issuance negatively predicts future returns and credit spreads positively predict future
returns (Greenwood and Hanson [2013] and López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek [2017]). In fact,
in our model, credit spreads are typically too low just before the economy experiences a wave of
defaults, consistent with the evidence of Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018) about the behavior of
3

credit spreads before …nancial crises. Third, when credit markets become highly overheated, our
model generates negative conditional expected excess returns on risky bonds. This result, which
is consistent with empirical …ndings in Greenwood and Hanson (2013) and Baron and Xiong
(2017), is di¢ cult to square with rational, risk-based models of credit cycles and is a powerful
motivator for models of the credit cycle, such as ours, which prominently feature biased investor
beliefs.
After developing our baseline model, we brie‡y consider two extensions. First, we allow …rms
to opportunistically issue more debt when investors are underpricing credit risk. This opportunistic supply response means that credit booms have the potential to sow the seeds of their
own destruction. Speci…cally, overly optimistic investor beliefs about future defaults can sometimes lead …rms to issue more debt— especially since extrapolative investors underreact to the
resulting increase in …rm leverage— raising the likelihood of a future credit market bust. Our
second extension features multiple issuing …rms who face idiosyncratic cash ‡ow shocks. This
extension addresses a limitation of the baseline model which is that, with a single representative …rm, defaults are necessarily binary events. Allowing for multiple …rms naturally yields a
continuous default rate for the economy and leads to more realistic model-implied dynamics.
Our paper has much in common with Austrian theories of the credit cycle, including Mises
(1924) and Hayek (1925), as well as the accounts of booms, panics, and crashes by Minksy
(1986) and Kindleberger (1978). More recently, the idea that investors may neglect tail risk in
credit markets was developed theoretically by Greenwood and Hanson (2013), Gennaioli, Shleifer,
and Vishny (2012, 2015), and Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2018) and has been supported
by numerous accounts of the 2007-2009 …nancial crisis (Coval, Jurek, and Sta¤ord [2009] and
Gennaioli and Shleifer [2018]). We also draw on growing evidence that investors extrapolate cash
‡ows, past returns, or past crash occurrences (Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny [1998], Greenwood
and Shleifer [2014], Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer [2015, 2018], Jin [2015], Greenwood
and Hanson [2015]). Most related here is Jin (2015), who presents a model in which investors’
perceptions of crash risk depend on recent experience.
Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer (2018) also provide a model of credit cycles in which extrapolative investor expectations play an important role and in which bond returns are predictable.
Their model is similar to ours in several respects, but extrapolative expectations in their model
are perfectly tied to cash ‡ow fundamentals, rather than to endogenous credit market outcomes.
Extrapolative expectations amplify exogenous ‡uctuations in fundamentals, but in their model
the credit cycle and the business cycle are fully synchronized. The fact that investors extrapolate
an endogenous outcome in our model leads to episodes in which the credit market can become
quite disconnected from the economy, acquiring a life of its own in the short run.1

In Section 2, we summarize a number of stylized facts about the credit cycle, drawing on
the papers cited above but also presenting some novel observations about the synchronicity of
the credit cycle and the business cycle. Section 3 develops the baseline model featuring a single
representative …rm, and explain the two-way feedback mechanism that is at the heart of our
model. In Section 4, we then discuss how the model can match a number of features of credit
cycles that researchers have documented in recent years, such as the predictability of returns
and low credit spreads before crises. Section 5 brie‡y explores two extensions of the baseline
model: one featuring an opportunistic supply response by …rms when investors are mispricing
risky bonds and a second featuring multiple heterogeneous …rms. Section 6 concludes.

Motivating facts about the credit cycle

We begin by summarizing a set of stylized facts about credit cycles. The …rst four facts are
drawn from previous work; the …fth is based on some new empirical work of our own.
Observation 1. Rapid credit growth predicts …nancial crises and business cycle downturns.
In a panel of 14 countries dating back to 1870, Schularick and Taylor (2012) show that
periods of rapid credit growth predict …nancial crises. Schularick and Taylor (2012) interpret
their evidence as suggesting that …nancial crises are episodes of “credit booms gone bust.”More
recently, Mian, Su…, and Verner (2017) show that rapid credit growth— and especially growth in
household credit— predicts future declines in GDP growth in an panel of 30 countries from 1960
to 2012. López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017) show that frothy credit market conditions—
proxied using declines in the credit quality of debt issuers and low credit spreads— predict low
GDP growth in U.S. data from 1929 to 2015. López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017) attribute
their …ndings to predictable reversals in credit market sentiment. Consistent with this view,
using an international panel of 38 countries, Kirti (2018) shows that rapid credit growth that is
accompanied by a deterioration in lending standards— i.e., by declining debt issuer quality— is
associated with low future GDP growth. By contrast, when rapid credit growth is accompanied
by stable lending standards, there is no such decline in future GDP growth.
A corollary of Observation 1— i.e., that credit growth predicts …nancial crises— is that economies
that have experienced high credit growth are more fragile. Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018) argue
that the natural way to interpret Schularick and Taylor’s (2012) …ndings about credit growth and
…nancial crises is that credit growth creates …nancial fragility. When a more leveraged economy
is exogenously hit by a negative fundamental shock, such as a large decline in house prices, this
results in a …nancial crisis. And, as one would expect, Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018) …nd
that credit spreads spike on the eve of a …nancial crisis. Alternately, crises may be triggered by
model in which self-ful…lling credit market freezes can arise because of interdependence between …rms.

5

predictable reversals in credit market sentiment as argued by López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek
(2017). Consistent with this view, Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018) show that credit spreads are
typically “too low” in the years preceding …nancial crises. The model we develop re‡ects both
of these ideas: as leverage grows, the probability of a default becomes more and more sensitive
to both changes in underlying fundamentals and to changes in biased investor beliefs.
Observation 2. Credit market overheating— signaled either by (i) a rapid growth in debt outstanding or (ii) by a decline in the credit quality of debt issuers set against the backdrop of
(relatively) low credit spreads— predicts low future returns on risky bonds.
A growing literature has demonstrated that credit market overheating predicts low future
returns on risky bonds. Greenwood and Hanson (2013) …nd that rapid growth in outstanding
corporate credit is associated with low future returns on risky bonds in U.S. data. Adopting
a similar intuition, Baron and Xiong (2017) show that bank credit expansion also predicts low
bank equity returns— which are naturally tied to the realized returns on risky debt— in a panel
of 20 developed economies from 1920 to 2012.
Greenwood and Hanson (2013) develop an even more statistically powerful measure of credit
market overheating based on the credit quality of corporate debt issuers. Their “high yield share”
measure— the share of all corporate bond issuance in a given year that is from high-yield-rated
…rms— captures the intuition that when credit markets are overheated, low quality …rms increase
their borrowing to take advantage. Greenwood and Hanson (2013) show that declines in issuer
credit quality predict low future corporate bond returns in a univariate sense. Furthermore, as
emphasized by Greenwood and Hanson (2013) and López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017),
issuer quality contains information about future bond returns beyond that contained in credit
spreads. Speci…cally, in a multivariate regression speci…cation, low-quality issuance negatively
predicts future returns and credit spreads positively predict future bond returns.
Table 1 updates the data from Greenwood and Hanson (2013) and also considers a set of
additional proxies for credit market overheating. The table shows annual return forecasting
regressions of the form:
rxHY
t!t+k = a + b Overheatingt + et!t+k ;

(1)

where rxHY
t!t+k denotes the log return on high yield bonds in excess of the log returns on likematurity Treasuries over a k = 2- or 3-year horizon beginning in year t. Here Overheatingt is a
proxy for credit market overheating, measured using data through the end of year t. All of our
data begin in 1983 and run through 2014.2
Columns (1) and (5) show that the log high yield share (log(HY St )) signi…cantly predicts
2

For results over di¤erent time horizons and with additional controls, see Greenwood and Hanson (2013) who
compute alternate proxies for issuer quality that extend back as far as 1926.

low future excess bond returns. A one standard deviation in log(HY St ) is associated with an
8.3 percentage point reduction in log excess bond returns over the next two years, and a 9.7
percentage point reduction over the next three years.
Columns (2) and (6) of Table 1 show that the same forecasting results hold when credit market
overheating is measured using the growth in aggregate non…nancial corporate credit outstanding,
Credit Growtht . Aggregate non…nancial corporate credit is the sum of non…nancial corporate
debt securities and loans from Table L103 of the Federal Reserve’s Financial Accounts of the U.S.
A one standard deviation increase in Credit Growtht forecasts a 7.4 percentage point reduction
in excess bond returns over the next two years, and a 9.3 percentage point reduction over the
next three years.
Table 1 shows results for two additional measures of credit market overheating. The …rst,
Easy Creditt , is based on the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan O¢ cer Opinion Survey (SLOOS),
and the second,

1

EBPt , is negative one times the Excess Bond Premium (EBPt ) from

Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012).3;4 Table 1 shows that both of these additional measures of credit
market overheating forecast low future returns on corporate bonds. To summarize, Table 1
con…rms that periods of credit market overheating— periods featuring low credit quality debt
issuance, rapid growth in outstanding credit, loose credit standards, and tight credit spreads—
are followed by low subsequent returns on risky corporate bonds.
Observation 3. Signi…cant credit market overheating is associated with negative expected future
returns on risky bonds.
Of course, the fact that corporate bond returns are predictable does not imply that corporate
bonds are occasionally mispriced. For instance, if the rationally-required return on risky corporate
bonds ‡uctuates over time— e.g., due to movements in investor risk aversion (Campbell and
Cochrane [1999]) or in the quantity of aggregate risk (Bansal and Yaron [2004], Gabaix [2012],
Wachter [2013]), then the level of credit spreads might forecast future returns on corporate
bonds. And, combining such ‡uctuations in rationally-required returns with the neoclassical qtheory of investment, one might expect recent credit growth and declines in debt issuer quality to
forecast low future returns on risky corporate bonds (Greenwood and Hanson [2013] and Gomes,
3

Every quarter, the Federal Reserve surveys senior loan o¢ cers of major domestic banks concerning their
lending standards. O¢ cers report whether they have eased or tightened lending standards in the past quarter.
We construct a measure of credit market overheating, Easy Creditt , by taking the three-year average percentage
of banks that have reported easing credit standards to …rms in any given quarter. The idea behind this averaging
procedure is that we want to capture the level of bankers’ beliefs about future creditworthiness, whereas the
quarterly survey tracks changes from the previous quarter. The SLOOS begins in the …rst quarter of 1990, so
this measure of overheating begins in December 1992. Easy Creditt is 55% correlated with the high yield share
(HY St ) and 68% correlated with Credit Growtht .
4
Gilchrist and Zakrajšek’s (2012) EBPt variable is a measure of average corporate credit spreads after deducting an estimate of each bond’s expected credit losses and, thus, can be interpreted as a proxy for expected future
credit returns.

7

Grotteria, and Wachter [2019]).
However, Greenwood and Hanson (2013) and Baron and Xiong (2017) present evidence that
conditional expected excess returns on risky corporate bonds and bank stocks become reliably
negative when credit markets appear to be signi…cantly overheated— i.e., when many low quality
borrowers are able to obtain credit and when credit growth is rapid. Furthermore, these same
authors …nd that future risk is high when credit markets appear to be most overheated. These
negative expected returns and the negative conditional relationship between expected future risk
and return are quite di¢ cult to square with rational risk-based models— even rational models
with intermediation frictions5 — and are powerful motivations for the behavioral approach we
adopt in this paper. Speci…cally, these facts are most consistent with the idea that credit market
investors make biased forecasts of future corporate bond defaults, arguably because they overextrapolate recent outcomes.
Observation 4. Variables that forecast returns on risky bonds often do not forecast returns on
equities, and vice versa. Moreover, episodes of credit market overheating tend to follow periods
of tranquility in credit markets, namely periods when defaults are low and when the returns on
risky bonds are high.
What outcomes are credit-market investors over-extrapolating? One view is that investors
over-extrapolate some underlying set of economic fundamentals— e.g., …rm cash ‡ows or the state
of broader macroeconomy. This view leads to behavioral version of the q-theory of investment
(Greenwood and Hanson [2015], Gennaioli, Ma, and Shleifer [2016], Bordalo, Gennaioli, and
Shleifer [2017]) and generally suggests that equity-market sentiment and credit-market sentiment
should be tightly linked over time. However, in the data, many measures that predict credit
returns are not strong predictors of equity returns and vice versa (Greenwood and Hanson [2013]
and Ma [2018]). This disconnect between equity and credit market sentiment recommends a
more nuanced behavioral view in which equity and credit markets are partially-segmented and
investors in each market extrapolate past market-speci…c outcomes.
Consistent with the idea that credit market investors tend to over-extrapolate recent credit
market outcomes, Greenwood and Hanson (2013) show that past defaults and credit returns play
a dominant role in shaping credit-market sentiment. Speci…cally, Greenwood and Hanson (2013)
…nd that debt issuer quality tends to deteriorate following periods with low realized corporate
defaults and high realized returns on risky corporate bonds. However, after controlling for
these recent credit market outcomes, recent equity returns and macro variables have relatively
little impact on debt issuer quality. These …ndings motivate our model where credit investors
5

In models with intermediation frictions, changes in the health of intermediary balance sheets and the resulting
shifts in risk appetite play an important role in determining asset prices. See, for example, He and Krishnamurthy
(2013), Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014), and He, Kelly, and Manela (2017).

extrapolate past bond defaults, which themselves are not perfectly tied to …rm fundamentals.6
Table 2 presents additional evidence that periods of credit market overheating follow times
when corporate defaults are low. Speci…cally, Table 2 shows the results from estimating timeseries regressions of the form:
Overheatingt = a + b Deft + c Deft

1

+ et ;

(2)

where Deft denotes the default rate on high yield bonds in year t. We estimate this regression
using the same four measures of credit market overheating from Table 1. Table 2 shows that
there is a strong negative relationship between recent default rates and current credit market
overheating. Some measures of overheating (log(HY St ) and

1

EBPt ) are more highly corre-

lated with most recent default rates, while others are also strongly correlated with lagged default
rates (Credit Growtht and Easy Creditt ).
Observation 5. The credit cycle and the business cycle can be quite disconnected in the shortrun.
Consistent with the market-speci…c extrapolation view discussed above, the credit cycle can
become quite disconnected from both the broader business cycle as well as equity market conditions in the short-run.
Figure 2 plots the annual growth rate of U.S. GDP alongside the annual growth rate of
outstanding debt at non…nancial corporations, both expressed in real terms. In the upswing
proceeding the 2008 …nancial crisis, GDP growth peaked in March 2005, but credit growth
peaked more than two years later. This pattern of credit expansion at the end of an economic
expansion is also apparent in the late 1990s, with credit growth rising only at the end of the
business cycle. During downturns, the economy often recovers well before credit growth returns
to normal rates. In the most recent economic recovery, real credit growth …rst reached 3% in
2013, several years after the economy began its recovery. Overall, the correlation between credit
growth and GDP growth is only 43%.
Figure 3 illustrates the disconnect between the credit cycle and the business cycle in U.S.
data. Here we provide additional perspective on the lack of synchronicity between the credit
cycle and the business cycle. In particular, we show that credit growth tends to increase towards
the end of a business cycle boom. In Panel A of Figure 3, we plot real GDP growth from trough
to peak of the business cycle, by business cycle expansion quarter. As can be seen, GDP growth
is high in the beginning of business cycle expansions, but after quarter …ve, it stabilizes and if
anything, declines slightly in later quarters. In contrast, Panel B shows credit growth over the
6

Similarly, Greenwood and Shleifer (2014) show that past equity returns play an outsized role in shaping
equity-market sentiment, motivating the model in Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer (2015) where equity
investors extrapolate past equity returns (as opposed to …rm fundamentals).

same periods. As the …gure makes clear, credit expansion is particularly high in the latter part
of the business cycle.

A model of credit market sentiment

In this section, we consider an in…nite-horizon model with a representative …rm and a set of
identical, risk-neutral bond investors. Our assumption of a representative …rm is made purely
for simplicity. In Section 5, we introduce a continuum of …rms which are subject to heterogeneous
cash ‡ow shocks.
We …rst describe …rm borrowing behavior and then explain investor beliefs, collecting several
preliminary results along the way. We then present a series of formal results and numerical
simulations that trace out the model’s key implications for credit market dynamics.

3.1

Firm borrowing

In order to focus on the dynamic interplay between investor beliefs and …rm defaults, we model
…rm borrowing behavior in a deliberately sparing fashion. Each period t, the representative …rm
invests in a one-period project that requires a …xed up-front cost of c > 0. The next period, the
project generates a random cash ‡ow, xt+1 , that follows an exogenously given AR(1) process
xt+1
where x

x = (xt

x) + "t+1 ;

c and the fundamental cash ‡ow shock "t+1

is i:i:d. over time.

The …rm issues one-period bonds in order to …nance these one-period projects. Each bond is
a promise to pay back one dollar to investors in one period. At time t, the price of each bond is
denoted pt . The total face amount of debt outstanding at time t is Ft , meaning that the …rm is
obligated to repay Ft dollars to investors at time t + 1.
At time t, the …rm must repay the face amount of debt issued the prior period Ft 1 . The
…rm also must pay the cost c to begin a new project and receives the cash ‡ow xt from the prior
period’s project. Finally, the …rm can issue new bonds at a price of pt . Assuming the …rm does
not default and does not pay dividends to equity holders at time t, the total face amount of
bonds outstanding at time t is
Ft = (Ft

1

+c

xt )=pt ,

(4)

which is obtained by equating sources and uses.7 This law of motion is consistent with the fact
7

We assume that the …rm always decides to invest, even when expected cash ‡ows tomorrow do not cover the
current cost— i.e., when c > x + (xt x). There are two possible interpretations of this assumption. First, we
could assume that the …rm is operating a long-run technology that generates the stream fxt g, that c is the cost
of continuation each period, and that continuation is (almost) always e¢ cient. Alternately, we could assume that

10

that non…nancial leverage is typically counter-cyclical, falling in good times when xt is high and
rising in bad times when xt is low (Korajczyk and Levy [2003] and Halling, Yu, and Zechner
[2016]).
We assume a simple mechanistic default rule. One should interpret a default by the representative …rm in our model as a “credit market bust” in which there is an economy-wide spike
in corporate defaults. Speci…cally, if at any time t, Ft

1

+c

xt rises above a threshold of F ,

the representative …rm defaults. The existence of this threshold F can be seen as a reduced
form for informational or agency frictions that grow more severe as the amount of required external …nancing rises. Alternately, such a threshold may arise from the optimal exercise of the
…rm’s default option by equity holders as in Leland (1994). Formally, letting Dt denote a binary
variable indicating whether or not a default occurs at time t, we have
Dt = 1fFt

1 +c

xt F g .

(5)

The “default boundary”is the line in (Ft 1 ; xt ) space where this default indicator switches on or
o¤— i.e., the line Ft

1

=F

c + xt .

In the event of default, the …rm continues to operate. However, the …rms’ existing equityholders are wiped out and the …rm writes o¤ a fraction of its debt much like under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Speci…cally, if the …rm defaults, a fraction 1

of the …rm’s debt

is written o¤, generating losses for existing bondholders, and the remaining fraction

2 (0; 1)

is re…nanced at current market prices. Thus, if the …rm defaults at time t, the amount of debt
outstanding becomes
Ft = (Ft
Finally, we assume that if Ft

+c

xt )=pt .

(6)

F , the …rm sets Ft = F =pt and pays all residual

cash ‡ows to equity holders as a dividend. The idea underlying the lower barrier F > 0 for
debt outstanding can be motivated via the pecking order theory of capital structure (Myers and
Majluf [1984]). Firms only raise external …nance in the form of debt. And when there is available
free cash ‡ow, the …rm …rst uses this cash ‡ow to retire existing debts. However, once the face
value of debt reaches a su¢ ciently low level, the …rm chooses to pay out all available free cash
‡ow to its equity holders.8
managers receive private bene…ts from running the …rm and will always choose continuation even if continuation
is value destroying.
8
To endogenize the upper threshold F , we could assume that at any time, equity holders can default on the
…rm’s outstanding debt and abscond with some fraction of the …rm’s total enterprise value. Equity holders decide
whether or not to exercise this default option by comparing the present value of expected future dividends to
the value of this outside default option. Since, all else equal, the present value of expected future dividends is
decreasing in the amount of outstanding debt, this means that equity holders will choose to default once the face
value of debt reaches a su¢ ciently high level.
Similarly, the lower threshold F could be endogenized by assuming that the …rm’s equity holders trade o¤ the
value of receiving dividends today versus the value of further debt reduction. Further debt reduction lowers the

In summary, our assumptions imply that the …rm defaults and its debt is written down when
outstanding debt grows too large relative to the …rm’s current free cash ‡ows (xt

c)— i.e., when

c). Conversely, the …rm stops paying down its debt and instead pays all residual

cash ‡ows to equity holders when outstanding debt grows small relative to the …rm’s current free
cash ‡ows— i.e., when Ft

c). In between these upper and lower boundaries, all else

F + (xt

equal, the …rm’s debt outstanding grows faster when re…nancing conditions are less favorable—
i.e., when the price of new bonds pt is lower— and when the ratio of the …rm’s free cash ‡ow to
outstanding debt (xt

c) =Ft

1

is lower.9 While clearly simplistic, these dynamics can be seen

as a shorthand for the kinds of behavior that emerge from more complex, dynamic models of
…rm investment and capital structure choice.
Before turning to investor beliefs, we note that, taking Ft as given, it is straightforward to
compute the fully-rational, forward-looking probability of a default at time t+1, which we denote
R
t .

of debt reduction decline with the level of debt, the …rm chooses to pay out free cash ‡ow to equity holders once
the face value of debt reaches a su¢ ciently low level.

These statements follow from the fact that (Ft Ft 1 ) =Ft 1 = ((1 pt ) (xt c) =Ft 1 ) =pt if the …rm does
not default or pay dividends at time t.

This formulation of beliefs is in the spirit of Fuster, Laibson, and Mendel (2010) and Fuster,
Hebert, and Laibson (2011) who argue that many agents have “natural expectations” which
are a combination of fully-rational expectations and extrapolative expectations. Equation (8)
conveniently covers the polar cases of fully-rational expectations ( = 0) and fully-extrapolative
expectations ( = 1).
Our formulation of beliefs in equation (8) embeds two distinct notions of “credit market
B
t

sentiment.” First, one might say that credit market sentiment is elevated when

is low— i.e.,

when future defaults are perceived as being unlikely according to the extrapolative component
of investor beliefs. Alternately, one might say that credit market sentiment is elevated when
B
t

R

is high— i.e., when investors are underestimating the true likelihood of a future default.

In a moment, we will detail precisely how
a rational-expectations equilibrium when

B

B

< 1. For now, we take

The default rule in equations (5) and (6) and the bond pricing equation (9) give rise to the
following law of motion for the amount of debt outstanding:

Since p(

for the amount of debt outstanding.
The model is fully characterized by equations (3), (9), and (10), together with the speci…cations for

R
t

in equation (13) which will be introduced below.

We now introduce our speci…cation

the extrapolative, backward-looking component of investors’ time-t beliefs about the

likelihood of a default at time t+1. We assume that

B
t

depends solely on past default realizations

and past “sentiment” shocks that are unrelated to cash ‡ow fundamentals. Speci…cally, we
assume that the law of motion for this backward-looking component of beliefs is
B
t

= max 0; min 1;

is independent of the fundamental cash ‡ow shocks "t . The min and max functions in equation

( Dt

j

is always between 0 and 1, we have
(12)

+ !t j ) :

In this case, the extrapolative component of beliefs is just a geometric moving average of past
defaults and past sentiment shocks.
The speci…cation for extrapolative beliefs in equation (11) is similar to speci…cations in Barberis, Greenwood, Jin, and Shleifer (2015, 2018), and Nagel and Xu (2018). Empirically, equation
(11) is motivated by the …ndings in Greenwood and Hanson (2013) who present evidence that
credit market investors tend to extrapolate recent credit market outcomes. They show that
credit market sentiment rises following periods when default rates have fallen and the returns on
high-yield bonds have been high. These results hold controlling for contemporaneous conditions
in the macroeconomy and in the stock market, suggesting that it is credit market outcomes, not
fundamentals, that are being extrapolated.10
The following lemma explains how this extrapolative component of beliefs evolves over time.
Lemma 1 Assume there are no sentiment shocks (i.e., ! t = 0 for all t), so the law of motion
of for the extrapolative component of beliefs is simply

We do not take a strong stance of the psychological underpinnings of over-extrapolation. Overextrapolation
could stem from the representativeness heuristic and a belief in the “law of small numbers” (Kahneman and
Tversky [1972], Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny [1998], Rabin [2002], Gennaioli and Shleifer [2010])) or from
experience e¤ects and reinforcement learning in the presence of fading memory (Malmendier and Nagel [2011,
2016], Nagel and Xu [2018], Malmedier, Pouzo, and Vanasco [2018]).

14

Naturally, the dynamics of

B
t

and the rate of memory decay (1

are governed by the incremental impact of a default on beliefs
). As we will see below, the potential for backward-looking

beliefs to drive persistent default cycles is greatest when the incremental belief impact
and when

is high

is close to 1 so memory fades slowly. In this case, a default episode makes investors

much more pessimistic, which in turn makes it more di¢ cult for …rms to re…nance maturing
debt.
Solving for rational expectations equilibrium. We now close the model by explaining how
R
t
R
t

is pinned down in a rational expectations equilibrium when

< 1. According to equation (7),
R
t

depends on Ft . However, equations (9) and (10) imply that Ft depends on

and Ft must be simultaneously determined in equilibrium.
R
t

The simultaneous determination of Ft and

introduces the potential for multiple equilib-

ria. The potential for equilibrium multiplicity re‡ects a straightforward self-ful…lling-prophecy
intuition. If the rational component of investor beliefs about future default probabilities is low
(high), then current bond prices are high (low). As a result, the face value of debt …rms that
must promise to repay tomorrow is low (high), leading to a true probability of default tomorrow
that is indeed low (high). Unlike in classic bank run models (e.g., Diamond and Dybvig [1983]
and Goldstein and Pauzner [2005]), multiple equilibria in our model do not arise from strategic
complementarities between the …nancing decisions of individual short-run creditors: the investors
in our model are nonstrategic price-takers. Instead, multiple equilibria arise for reasons similar
to those in classic models of sovereign default (e.g., Calvo [1988] and Cole and Kehoe [2000]).

is

a continuous function that maps the unit interval into itself, so a …xed point always exists by
Brouwer’s …xed-point theorem.
Multiple equilibria are more likely to arise (i) when investor beliefs are more rational and
forward-looking (i.e., when

is low); (ii) when the con…guration of (Ft 1 ;

B
t ; xt )

means that the

…rm will be near the default boundary at time t + 1; and (iii) when cash ‡ow volatility

"

is low.

First, rational beliefs have a larger impact on current bond prices and hence on the likelihood of
future defaults when

is low. Indeed, there is always a single unique equilibrium when
15

= 1 and

beliefs are completely extrapolative. Second, multiple equilibria will only arise when the …rm
will be near the default boundary at time t + 1. If the …rm is very far from the default boundary,
then @g(

R
t j

)=@

R
t

is always small— there is no scope for self-ful…lling rational beliefs— and there

is a unique equilibrium. Finally, when future cash ‡ows are volatile (i.e., when

"

is high), the

downside risk for the future cash ‡ows is generally high which reduces the e¤ect of self-ful…lling
rational beliefs on future defaults. In this case, the model has a unique equilibrium. Conversely,
when future cash ‡ows are not very volatile, self-fulling rational beliefs have a bigger impact on
future defaults and sometimes lead to multiple equilibria.11
How do we select amongst these equilibria when more than one exists? We focus on the smallR

est

R

that solves

= g(

R

j )— i.e., the model’s “best”stable equilibrium.12 An equilibrium is

“stable” if it is robust to a small perturbation in investors’beliefs regarding the likelihood of a
default tomorrow. In our setting, if @g(

R

j )=@

R

is stable; if @g(

R

> 1,

is unstable. Since g(0j ) > 0 and g(1j ) < 1, our model always has at least one stable

equilibrium. Following the correspondence principle of Samuelson (1947), stable equilibria have
local comparative statics that accord with common sense. For example, at a stable equilibrium,
R
t

is locally increasing in Ft

Next, assume that the economy is near the default boundary at time t, so small changes in

small increase in Ft

Similarly, near the default boundary, a small increase in

We obtain very similar simulation results if we instead focus on the the largest R that solves R = g( R j )—
i.e., the model’s “worst” stable equilibrium.

Understanding Re‡exivity

Our model captures the idea that, in credit markets, investors’biased beliefs can impact …nancial
reality. Past defaults and sentiment shocks a¤ect investors’ beliefs about future defaults via
equation (11). These biased beliefs then impact bond prices via equation (9). And, since bond
prices in‡uence the ease with which the …rm can re…nance its existing debt, they in turn a¤ect the
evolution of debt outstanding via equation (10) and hence the true probability of future defaults
in equation (7). As a result, biased investor beliefs have the potential to become partially selfful…lling.
In this section, we provide a set of formal results and simulations to illustrate the key implications of the model. We …rst introduce a baseline set of model parameters and demonstrate
that the impact of biased investor beliefs on market outcomes is not constant: there are states
where biased beliefs have a large impact on market outcomes and states where the impact is
much smaller. We then lay out three main implications of the model: the “calm before the
storm”phenomenon, the “default spiral”phenomenon, and the predictability of corporate bond
returns. As we emphasize, these three novel implications re‡ect the interaction between default
extrapolation and the re‡exive nature of credit markets. In other words, these three results arise
because (i) investors hold beliefs that are (partially) backward-looking— i.e., they extrapolate
past defaults when forming beliefs about future defaults— and (ii) beliefs about future defaults
are (partially) self-ful…lling. We also use the model to draw impulse-response functions which
show how shocks to cash ‡ow fundamentals and investor beliefs impact credit markets.

4.1

Model parameters and simulated data

When using the model to generate simulated data, we use the following set of baseline parameters:
Cash ‡ow dynamics: x = 2:4,

= 0:8,

"

= 0:5.

Investment cost: c = 2.
Default and dividend barriers: F = 5, F = 1:5.

17

While these parameters are only illustrative, they have a number of desirable properties based
on simulating the model for 100; 000 periods (each period is one year):
1. The unconditional default probability is realistic. Here the unconditional probability
of default is 12%. As noted above, one should interpret a default by our representative …rm
as a “credit market bust” in which there is an economy-wide spike in corporate defaults.
Thus, these parameters imply that roughly one in ten years corresponds to such a bust.

Figure 4 shows a typical sample path of simulated data using these parameters. Notice that
the time-series distribution of

is bimodal:

R
t

is typically either close to zero or 1. This bimodal

distribution is largely a function of the short-term nature of debt in our model: short-term debt
is extremely safe until it suddenly becomes risky.14

4.2

The degree of re‡exivity varies over time

As noted above, our model captures the idea that investors’ biased beliefs can impact reality
because re…nancing terms are a …rst-order determinant of …rm creditworthiness. While the
feedback loop between biased beliefs and credit market outcomes is always present, there are
times when this re‡exive feedback loop is particularly strong. Speci…cally, we say that the

However, the partially forward-looking nature of investor beliefs also contributes to the bimodal distribution
of R
t . Speci…cally, when < 1, the model admits multiple equilibria and the smallest stable equilibrium will often
discretely jump from R
0 to R
1 as the economy approaches the default boundary. This e¤ect is diminished

when we increase , so the distribution of R

In summary, highly re‡exive states are likely to arise near the end of a long credit boom
where investors are still bullish, but default is not yet imminent. In this case, a credit crisis can
suddently become far more likely if investors become slightly more bearish on credit (i.e., if

B
t

rises slightly). Highly re‡exive states can also arise in the wake of a credit bust where investors
are still bearish. Here the likelihood that the credit crisis persists can drop dramatically if
investors become slightly more bullish on credit (i.e., if

falls slightly).

The “calm before the storm” phenomenon

An elevated level of credit market sentiment— here in the sense of a lower level of

B
t —

slows down

the accumulation of debt in the face of deteriorating cash ‡ows fundamentals, thereby delaying
or even preventing future defaults altogether. We term this phenomenon the “calm before the
storm.”Below we provide a formal result regarding this phenomenon.
Proposition 1 Calm before the storm. Assume that
outstanding Ft
B
t

> 0. For any initial level of debt

and cash ‡ow xt , lowering the initial extrapolative component of investor beliefs

weakly delays the next default path by path— i.e., for any given time series of future cash ‡ow

and sentiment shocks— and strictly delays the next default in expectation.
To illustrate the “calm before the storm”phenomenon, Panel A of Figure 6 depicts a sample
path of the model using our baseline set of parameters where

= 0:5. The cash ‡ow fundamental

xt is initially set to x0 = 1:5 < 2 = c and debt is set to F0 = 3:5. We assume that all of the
subsequent shocks are zero ("t = ! t = 0). Figure 6 plots cash ‡ow xt , debt outstanding Ft ,
the default indicator Dt , bond prices pt , rational beliefs

B

(Low).

Consistent with Proposition 1, more optimistic initial beliefs have the potential to delay default
in the face of poor fundamental cash ‡ows.
Naturally, this e¤ect becomes stronger for higher values of — i.e., as beliefs become more
backward-looking. For example, Panel B of Figure 6 shows that, if we instead set
20

= 1, then

the …rm defaults at t = 3 when

B

(Low),

narrowly averting default altogether. This happens because, in this case, bond prices stay high
for long enough that the …rm is able to re…nance its debt until fundamentals rise back above c.
This “calm before the storm”behavior is consistent with the evidence in Krishnamurthy and
Muir (2018) who examine the behavior of credit spreads around a large sample of …nancial crises
in developed countries. Speci…cally, in our model, credit spreads are typically low in the run-up
to a default and but jump up on the eve of a default, just as Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018) …nd
in the data. We can draw the link to Krishnamurthy and Muir’s (2018) results more formally by
tracing out the model-implied expected path of credit spreads conditional on a …nancial crisis
at time

= 0. Speci…cally, we take simulated data from the model and estimate regression

speci…cations of the form:

pt is the analog to the credit spread in our model. We then plot the

b regression coe¢ cients versus event time

for this regression in Figure 7, e¤ectively tracing

out the model-implied expected path of credit spreads in event time conditional on a …nancial
crisis at time

= 0. For purposes of comparison, we repeat the exercise separately for the

rational, forward-looking component of spreads, (1

However,

we see that credit spreads are typically “too narrow”

prior to …nancial crises as argued in Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018). On the other hand, Figure
7 also shows that credit spreads are usually “too wide”in the aftermath of crises.
The calm before the storm phenomenon also helps make sense of what Gennaioli and Shleifer
(2018) have dubbed the “quiet period”of the 2008 global …nancial crisis— the period between the
initial disruptions in housing and credit markets in the summer of 2007 and onset of a full-blown
…nancial crisis in the fall of 2008. Indeed, as Gennaioli and Shleifer (2018) argue, if investors were
fully forward-looking ( = 0), one might have expected a more rapid deterioration of …nancial
conditions in late 2007 rather than the slow slide into crisis that was witnessed.

4.4

The “default spiral” phenomenon

Once the storm hits the credit market, default extrapolation can generate a “default spiral”:
extrapolative, backward-looking beliefs lead to a form of default persistence that is absent when
beliefs are fully rational and forward-looking. Speci…cally, investor beliefs typically become more
pessimistic following a default according to equation (11). This pushes down bond prices, raising
21

debt outstanding, and increasing the likelihood of future defaults.
Persistent default spirals can arise even when fundamental cash ‡ows are strong (xt > c) if
(i)

is su¢ ciently large, (ii) the increment

beliefs (1

is large relative to the decay rate of extrapolative

), (iii) the initial debt level is su¢ ciently high, and (iv) the initial backward-looking

component of beliefs is su¢ ciently pessimistic. We formalize this observation in the following
proposition.
Proposition 2 Default spirals. Assume that (i) Ft 1 +c xt
(Dt = 1); (ii)

> (1

F , so there is a default at time t

) and ! t = 0, so extrapolative beliefs necessarily become more pessimistic

following this default; (iii) extrapolative beliefs are initially relatively pessimistic (
and (iv) xt = xt

1

= x > c. Let pt ( ), Ft ( ), and

R
t

B
t 1

R
t 1 );

( ) denote the time t price, amount of

outstanding debt, and true probability of default when a fraction

of beliefs is backward-looking.

Although default leads to a reduction in debt— i.e., Ft ( ) < Ft

for any — pt ( ) is decreasing

in . And Ft ( ) and

R
t

1

( ) are increasing in . Thus, a larger extrapolative component of

beliefs lowers prices and slows the process of debt discharge in the event of default, increasing the
likelihood of a future default.
Proposition 2 says that, even when current fundamentals are strong (xt > c), a large accumulated debt balance can lead to a string of multiple defaults due to the negative feedback loop
induced by default extrapolation. Speci…cally, if investor beliefs are highly backward-looking
(i.e., if

is high), then default extrapolation keeps bond prices low and the debt level high for

many periods. As a result, there is a lengthy sequence of defaults, especially when investors are
initially highly pessimistic (i.e., when

B
t

is initially elevated). By contrast, if investor beliefs are

largely rational and forward-looking (i.e., when

is low), the debt writedown that occurs upon

default leads to an immediate decrease in the rationally-expected default rate

R
t .

As a result,

bond prices quickly recover following the default and the …rm rapidly repays its debts.
This default spiral dynamic highlights the potential disconnect between the endogenous credit
cycle and the underlying business cycle that is at the heart of our model. In particular, the
extrapolative nature of investor beliefs can make the …nancial recovery from a crises slower and
more protracted than in a world with fully forward-looking investors. This dynamic means
that a moderate improvement in cash ‡ows can be insu¢ cient to “rescue” credit markets from
a depressed state. Moreover, the likely timing of the recovery is in‡uenced by the extent of
backward-looking extrapolation ( ) and the initial pessimism of investor beliefs (
a large improvement in cash ‡ows to ensure a recovery when both

are high. The crucial

role that investor beliefs play in driving default spirals suggests that a favorable sentiment shock
(i.e., a large negative draw of ! t ) coming from a policy intervention may also be an e¤ective way
to help credit markets recover.

Bond return predictability

Bond returns are predictable in our model whenever

> 0— i.e., whenever beliefs are partially

extrapolative and backward-looking. To see this, note that an investor who buy bonds for a price
of pt = p(

R
t )

expected return on bonds from time t to t + 1— i.e., EC

nario where investors are over-estimating the likelihood of future defaults because they have just
witnessed a default,

R

and ER
t [rt+1 ] > 0.

The fact bond returns are predictable is not surprising given our assumption that investor
beliefs are not fully rational. However, the comparative statics of expected bond returns ER

are informative and are consistent with much recent research on credit cycles. First, using
equation (18) we can ask how a small change in

as an inverse measure of issuing …rms’ creditworthiness, then equation (19)

is consistent with the …ndings in Greenwood and Hanson (2013) who …nd that a deterioration
the credit quality of issuing …rms negatively predicts future debt returns in a univariate sense.
Going further, and assuming we are not at the default boundary, Lemma 1 implies that, all else
equal, a small increase in Ft

t [rt+1 ] and a small increase in xt leads to an

increase in ER

What is more interesting is that changes in investor sentiment— i.e., movements in

have

an ambiguous impact on expected bond returns due to the re‡exive nature of credit markets.
Holding …xed expected future debt repayments, more bearish investor beliefs (higher values
of

lowers bond prices, thereby raising expected bond returns. This is the intuition we

have from standard settings where beliefs do not impact security payo¤s. However, there is
a competing e¤ect that arises in our model because investor beliefs about future defaults are
partially self-ful…lling. Speci…cally, more bearish investor sentiment makes it more di¢ cult for
…rms to re…nance maturing debt, raising the true probability of default and lowering expected
future debt repayments. And, in highly re‡exive states where investor beliefs have a large

Another question we can address is whether rapid credit growth negatively forecasts the

indeed, we con…rm this in simulations below.

Forecasting returns and defaults in model simulations. To further explore the model’s
implications for return and default predictability, we …rst simulate the model for 100,000 periods
using the baseline parameters introduced above; each period represents one year. We then
examine the return and default forecasting regressions using current variables such as credit
growth and sentiment.
Table 3 shows that the model is able to match a number of facts that researchers have
documented about the credit cycle. First, consistent with Proposition 3, a higher level of …rm
cash ‡ow (xt ) and a lower level of …rm debt each positively forecast future bond returns. And,
a lower level of cash ‡ow (xt ) and a higher debt both positively forecast future defaults.
Second, consistent with the …ndings in Greenwood and Hanson (2013) and Barron and Xiong
(2017), recent credit growth negatively forecasts future bond returns: regressing returns over the
next year (rt+1 ) on the debt growth over the prior four years (Ft

Ft 4 ) yields a coe¢ cient of

0:04 with an R-squared of 33%. Furthermore, high recent credit growth also positively forecasts
defaults.
Third, credit spreads forecast future bond returns and defaults. Somewhat surprisingly, in
simulations using our baseline parameters, high credit spreads (credit-spreadt = 1 pt ) negatively
forecast future bond returns in a univariate regression— i.e., high bond prices predict high future
26

returns. However, this is not a robust implication of our model. Indeed, if we increase
2
!,

or

thereby raising the extrapolative component of beliefs or the volatility of sentiment shocks,

this raises the coe¢ cient on credit-spreadt , enabling the model to match the positive univariate
forecasting relationship between credit credits and bond returns that we see in the data.16

Model-implied impulse-response functions

To further explore the dynamic behavior implied by the model, we report impulse-response
functions which trace out the dynamic impact of shocks to underlying cash ‡ow fundamentals
and investor sentiment. Let zt = (xt ; Ft 1 ;

B
t )

denote the model’s state vector and consider

some model-implied quantity yt . The response of yt+j following an impulse "t = s" to cash ‡ow
fundamentals xt at time t is:
y

(j; zt 1 ; "t = s" ) = ER [yt+j jzt 1 ; "t = s" ]

ER [yt+j jzt 1 ; "t = 0].

Similarly, the response of yt+j following an impulse ! t = s! to investor sentiment

B
t

at time t

is:
y

(j; zt 1 ; ! t = s! ) = ER [yt+j jzt 1 ; ! t = s! ]

ER [yt+j jzt 1 ; ! t = 0]:

Due to the nonlinear nature of the model, these impulse response functions (IRFs) can be asymmetric in the sense that, for example,

y

(j; zt 1 ; ! t =

are also state-contingent in the sense that both

region of the parameter space: …rm leverage is low and cash ‡ows are strong, so changes in

the impulse-responses in Figure 9 are highly asymmetric. Starting from this initial condition,

true probability of default. First, consider an impulse to cash ‡ows xt at time 1. Compared to
the responses in Figure 9, the same impulse to fundamentals now has a far larger impact on other
model-implied quantities in Figure 10. In this way, our model naturally captures the fact that the
build up of debt creates fragility as emphasized by Krishnamurthy and Muir (2018). In Figure
10, a positive shock to fundamentals at time 1 often helps avert what would otherwise be a likely
default at time 2. Next, consider a shock to investor beliefs at time 1. In this highly re‡exive
region, a shock to investor beliefs has far larger impact on debt accumulation and defaults than
in the less re‡exive region shown in Figure 9. (Note the di¤erence in the y-axis scales in Figures
9 and 10.)

Model Extensions

In this section, we brie‡y consider two extensions of the baseline model. The …rst model extension
allows for opportunistic debt issuance by …rms to exploit the mispricing of debt. Under this
extension, credit booms can naturally sow the seeds of their own destruction. The second model
extension features multiple …rms who face idiosyncratic cash ‡ow shocks. This extension delivers
more empirically realistic dynamics of the aggregate default rate.

5.1

Opportunistic debt issuance

The …rst model extension allows for opportunistic debt issuance by …rms to exploit the mispricing
of debt. This extension addresses a …rst limitation of our baseline model: there is no sense in
which a credit boom that is triggered by elevated levels of credit market sentiment naturally sows
the seeds of its own destruction. Instead, all else equal, high levels of credit sentiment— i.e., lower
levels of

B
t —

always lead to a slower accumulation of debt, reducing the likelihood of a future

crisis.20 However, the boom-bust narratives in Kindleberger (1978) and Minsky (1986) suggest
that one might instead think a large over-valuation of risky debt (i.e., a large gap between
and

B
t )

R
t

could lead to an opportunistic increase in bond supply from …rms— with extrapolative

investors underreacting to the resulting increase in …rm leverage, thereby raising the risk of a
future credit crisis.21
As explained in the Appendix, this Minskian dynamic does not occur in our baseline model because both the demand and supply of bonds are downward-sloping: the non-standard downwardsloping supply curve arises because the supply of bonds is determined by …rms’binding sourcesand-used constraint. Of course, it is precisely the fact that both demand and supply slope

cannot be upward-sloping precludes the kind of opportunistic supply response that might allow
a credit boom to sow the seeds of its own destruction.

increasing future default probabilities.

are similar in Figures 9 and 11. However, in Figure 11, …rms’ opportunistic supply response
means that— in contrast to the baseline IRFs shown in Figure 9— a downward shock to

triggers an increase in outstanding debt Ft and a rise in the likelihood of a future default crisis.
In summary, …rms’opportunistic response to credit market sentiment means that credit booms
have the potential to sow the seeds of their own destruction.

5.2

Multiple …rms

The second model extension features multiple …rms who face idiosyncratic cash ‡ow shocks. This
extension addresses a limitation of baseline model which is that, with a single representative …rm,
defaults are necessarily binary events. Allowing for multiple …rms naturally yields a continuous
default rate for the economy and leads to more realistic model-implied dynamics.
We assume that there are N …rms, i = 1; 2; : : : ; N . The exogenous cash ‡ow of …rm i, xit ,
consists of two components:
xit = xt + zit ,

(23)

where the systematic component xt evolves according to equation (3) and the mean-zero, …rmspeci…c component zit follows
zit = zit
where

it

N (0;

2

1

+

it ,

(24)

) is i:i:d. over time, independent across …rms, and independent of the sys-

tematic cash ‡ow shock ("t ) and the aggregate sentiment shock (! t ).
We need to make an assumption about how investors price …rms’bonds. For simplicity, we
assume that all …rms’ bonds are priced identically even though …rms have heterogeneous cash
‡ows and debt levels. This assumption can be seen as a short-hand for the idea that investors
cannot perfectly observe each …rm’s cash ‡ow xit and leverage Fit

1

and treat some class of …rms

as a homogeneous category. The rule for …rm default is similar to that in the baseline model: if
at any time t, Fit

xit rises above F , then …rm i defaults at time t. Thus, the law of motion

for each …rm’s outstanding bonds Fit is similar to the baseline model. Speci…cally, we have

the rationally-expected economy-wide default rate at at time t+1—

Dt+1 .

We make three observations regarding the setup with multiple …rms. First, just as in the
baseline model, equations (25) and (28) imply that the right hand side of (28) can be viewed as a
continuous function of

R
t

that maps the unit interval into itself. Therefore, by Brouwer’s …xedB
t ,

point theorem, a solution exists. But, in addition to xt and
and fzit gN
i=1 now impact

R
t .

Nonetheless, the behavior of

R
t

the distributions of fFit 1 gN
i=1

with multiple …rms is qualitatively

similar to that described in Lemma 2 for a single representative …rm. Second, equations (27)
and (28) imply that there is belief contagion: the past defaults and likely future defaults of each
…rm a¤ect the bond price that applies to all …rms. Third, one consequence of having …rms with
di¤erent cash ‡ow and debt levels is that, at each point in time, only a fraction of …rms is close
to default. This makes it more di¢ cult for the multiple equilibria described in Section 3 to arise.
The model with multiple …rms yields similar qualitative implications to the baseline model
featuring a single representative …rm, albeit with more realistic time-series dynamics. For instance, the model with multiple …rms still features the “calm before the storm” and “default
spiral” phenomena. Similarly, since the realized return on an equal-weighted portfolio of risky
bonds from time t to t + 1 is
rt+1 =
and, since ER
t D t+1 =
ER
t [r t+1 ] =

R
t ,

we have

just as in the baseline model. Thus, the model with multiple heterogeneous …rms has similar
qualitative implications for bond return predictability as the baseline model with a representative
…rm.
Quantitatively, however, the model with multiple heterogeneous …rms leads to more realistic
32

time-series dynamics. To illustrate, Panel A of Figure 12 reports a sample path of the model
with N = 100 …rms. As a comparison, Panel B of Figure 12 plots the sample path using the
same aggregate cash ‡ow shocks and sentiment shocks but with a single representative …rm.
As can be seen, the dynamics of the economy-wide aggregates from the model with multiple
heterogeneous …rms are more empirically realistic than their counterparts from the model with
a single representative …rms.
In the example shown in Panel A of Figure 12, after staying above the long-run mean x for
many periods, cash ‡ow fundamentals xt begin to deteriorate in period 32. The actual default
rate stays lows for one more period— a “calm before the storm” period— and then starts to
rise in period 34. Furthermore, there is a clear lead-lag structure between the rational and the
R
t

behavioral components of investor beliefs:
in period 34 while

B
t

responds to deteriorating market fundamentals

only responds several periods later. Similarly,

market fundamentals in period 41 while

B
t

R
t

responds to improving

stays high for several more periods. Overall, the

presence of multiple …rms makes the rational and the behavioral components of investor beliefs
more synchronized: in this example, the time-series correlation between

R
t

and

B
t

increases

from 30% in the single …rm case (Panel B) to 69% in the multiple …rm case (Panel A).

Conclusion

We present a model of credit market cycles in which investors extrapolate past defaults. Our key
contribution is to model re‡exivity in credit markets, an endogenous two-way feedback between
biased investor beliefs and credit market outcomes. This feedback mechanism is particularly
germane in credit markets, because …rms must return to the market to re…nance maturing debts,
and the terms on which debt is re…nanced will impact the likelihood of future default.
As we have shown, the combination of extrapolative beliefs and re‡exive dynamics can lead to
large short-run disconnects between cash ‡ow fundamentals and credit market outcomes, including “calm before the storm” and “default spiral” episodes. Extrapolative beliefs also naturally
lead to bond return predictability. But what is most striking here is that changes in investor
sentiment can have an ambiguous impact on expected bond returns due to the re‡exive nature of
credit markets. When investors become more bullish, in the short run this can predict positive
returns, even if at longer horizons expected returns become more negative.
Our analysis leaves open at least two areas for further analysis. First, we have not allowed
conditions in credit markets to explicitly a¤ect the underlying cash ‡ow fundamentals of the
economy. Speci…cally, as demonstrated by a growing macro-…nance literature, the inability to
access credit on reasonable terms following a credit market bust may exacerbate an incipient
economic downturn. Relatedly, according to Austrian accounts of the credit cycles, as the credit
boom grows, increasing amounts of capital are devoted to poor quality projects to the detriment
33

of future macroeconomic fundamentals. Indeed, López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017) and
Mian, Su…, and Verner (2017) show that periods of credit market overheating forecast low economic growth. Incorporating these features into our model would likely further strengthen the
feedback loop between investor sentiment and credit market outcomes.
Second, we have been silent on issues of welfare and optimal policy, even though our model
suggests a potential role for policy. During credit booms, high sentiment can prevent defaults
from occurring in the near future, which can be welfare-improving if fundamentals recover soon
enough. Nonetheless, self-ful…lling beliefs during default spirals can be welfare-reducing, both
because these deteriorating beliefs accelerate future default realizations and because they lead to
a slow recovery in the presence of improving fundamentals. Accepting this at face value suggests
a role for policy in moderating investor beliefs.

Proofs

Proof of Lemma 1: Since < 1, B
t weakly declines if there is no default at time t and the
B
decline is strict if t 1 > 0.
How do extrapolative beliefs typically react to a default at time t— i.e., if Dt = 1 and ! t = 0?
B
> 0. If
(1
), B
In this case, B
t weakly increases following a default

t = min 1;
B

and the increase is strict if t 1 < 1: Speci…cally, if t < 1, then B

for all t 1 2 [0; 1) since

B

following

[0;
1).
Thus,
if
(1
),
extrapolative
beliefs
will
converge
to
for all B
t
t 1
a long sequence of defaults.
By contrast, if < (1
), extrapolative beliefs will not always become more pessimistic

t 1 as

B
) < 1 following a a long
= (1
) and extrapolative beliefs will converge to t = = (1
sequence of defaults.
Proof of Lemma 2: First, assume that the economy is not near the default boundary
Ft 1 + c xt = F , so small changes in Ft 1 and xt do not a¤ect whether there is a default
or the …rm pays dividends at time t. Suppose that we are at an equilibrium continuity point
R
B
where the smallest solution to R
t = g( t jFt 1 ; t ; xt ) is a continuous and di¤erentiable function
R
B
of Ft 1 ; B
t ; xt . (g( t jFt 1 ; t ; xt ) is continuous, but not di¤erentiable in Ft 1 at the dividend
payout boundary F = Ft 1 + c xt .) At such a continuity point, for any zt 2 Ft 1 ; B
t ; xt , we
R
R
have t =@zt = [@g( )=@zt ]=[1 @g( )=@ t ]. At a stable equilibrium we have @g( )=@ R
t < 1, so
R
B
this has the same sign as @g( )=@zt . This argument shows that @ R
=@F
>
0,
@
=@
t 1
t
t
t > 0,
R
and @ t =@xt < 0. There are also equilibrium discontinuity points where the number of solutions
to the …xed-point problem changes and the smallest solution discretely jumps. Although R
t is
B
not a continuous function of Ft 1 , t , xt at these equilibrium discontinuity points, the signs
of discrete jumps in R
t at these points will have the same signs as the partial derivatives at
equilibrium continuity points. For instance, an small increase in xt shifts the g( R
t j ) function
R
down for all t . At an equilibrium continuity point where the relevant partial derivative is wellde…ned, this results in a small decline in R
t . At an equilibrium discontinuity point where the
relevant partial derivative is not well-de…ned, this results in a discrete downward jump in R
t .
Second, assume that we are near the default boundary. At the default boundary the derivatives with respect to Ft 1 and xt are unde…ned. Near the default boundary, a small increase in
Ft 1 can trigger a default at time t, resulting in a discrete downward jump in R
t . Similarly, a
small increase in xt can avert a default at time t, resulting in a discrete upward jump in R
t .
Proof of Proposition 1 (Calm Before the Storm): We compare two sample paths,
B
denoted L and H, that di¤er only in their initial levels of B
t . Speci…cally, suppose that t (L) <
B
t (H). Because shocks to cash ‡ows and sentiment are exogenous, we have xt+j (L) = xt+j (H)
B
and ! t+j (L) = ! t+j (H) for all j 0. Because R
t and Ft are always increasing in t , we have
R
R
t (L) < t (H) and Ft (L) < Ft (H). Since Ft (L) < Ft (H), if there is a default at time t + 1
in the L path, then there is also a default at time t + 1 in the H path. However, we can have
default in the H path, but not in the L path at time t + 1.
Assume that there is no default at time t + 1 along either the L or H paths. Then we have
B
R
B
B
t+1 (L)
t+1 (H) by equation (11) and the equality is strict so long as 0 < t+1 (H). Since t+1
R
R
and Ft+1 are increasing in B
t+1 and Ft , it also follows that t+1 (L)
t+1 (H) and Ft+1 (L)
39

Ft+1 (H), if the
Ft+1 (H) and these inequalities are strict when 0 < B
t+1 (H). Since Ft+1 (L)
…rst default occurs at time t + 2 in the L path, then …rst default also occurs at time t + 2 in the
H path. However, we can have default in the H path, but not in the L path at t + 2.
Proceeding inductively in this fashion, we see that, so long as there is no default along either
B
Ft+j (H) and these inequalities
path by time t + j, we have B
t+j (H) and Ft+j (L)
t+j (L)
B
B
are strict when t+j (H) > 0. Thus, lowering the default rate t weakly delays the next future
default stochastic path by stochastic path. And, averaging across these paths, lowering the
default rate B
t strictly delays the next default in expectation.
Proof of Proposition 2 (Default Spiral): Since pt
, if there is a default at time t (i.e.,
Dt = 1) we have Ft = (Ft 1 + c xt ) =pt Ft 1 + c xt . Thus, if Dt = 1 and xt > c, we always
have Ft < Ft 1 . By contrast, if Dt = 1 and xt < c, we have Ft > Ft 1 if (c xt )= (pt =
1) > Ft 1
and Ft < Ft 1 if (c xt )= (pt =
1) < Ft 1 .

In other words, both the rational component and the combined belief become more pessimistic
as the fraction of backward-looking beliefs rises.
Since @ C
t ( ) =@ > 0, it then follows that @pt ( ) =@ < 0 and @Ft ( ) =@ > 0. Thus, a larger
extrapolative component of beliefs lowers prices and slows the process of debt discharge in the
event of default, increasing the chances of subsequent defaults. Indeed, for any > 0, we have
R
R
t ( ) > t (0) .

Model with opportunistic supply response: Assuming the …rm does not default or pay
dividends at time t, one can think of the baseline model as re‡ecting the interplay between the
demand and supply for risk bonds:

,

where Ft is the quantity of risky bonds issued at time t. We have @pD
t =@Ft < 0, so the demand for
bonds is downward sloping as is standard. (Here this works through a change in fundamentals:
the default probability increases as debt outstanding rises.) However, we also have @pSt =@Ft < 0:
supply is also downward sloping, which is non-standard. This is because the supply of bonds
is determined by …rms’binding sources-and-used constraint. Of course, it is the fact that both
demand and supply slope downwards that makes investor beliefs potentially self-ful…lling. However, the fact that supply cannot be upward-sloping precludes the kind of opportunistic supply
response that might might allow a credit boom to sow the seeds of its own destruction.
Once we introduce a opportunistic debt supply response, the equilibrium value of R
t must
solve the following …xed-point problem:
R

increasing in R

Figure 8. Impact of backward-looking beliefs on the true default probability and expected returns.
This figure plots the true default probability λ tR (blue) and rationally-expected returns  tR [ rt +1 ] (red)
against backward-looking beliefs λ tB in a highly reflexive region of the state spacei.e., a region
where ∂λ tR /∂λ tB is large so changes in beliefs have a large impact on future defaults. Specifically, we
set xt = 1.6 < 2 = c and Ft−1= 3.4. The other model parameters are the same as those in Figure 4:
x = 2.4, ρ = 0.8, σε = 0.5, c = 2, F = 1.5, F = 5, η = 0.5, β = 0.8, α = 0.2, σω = 0.05, and θ = 0.5.

for multiple firms (N = 100). Panel B shows the analogous simulation for a representative firm
using the exact same time series of aggregate cash flow shocks and sentiment shocks as those in
Panel A. For Panel A, the initial state of the economy is λ 0B = 0.2, x0 = 2, z0 = 0, and Fi0 = 4 for all
i. For Panel B, the initial state of the economy is λ 0B = 0.2, x0 = 2, and F0 = 4. In both panels, the

= 0.05, and θ = 0.5. In the Panel A, we also assume that ψ = 0.8 and σξ = 0.25.

rxtHY
a + b ⋅ Overheatingt + et →t + k ,
→t + k =
where Overheatingt is a proxy for credit market overheating in year t. The data begins in 1983
and ends in 2014. The dependent variable is the cumulative k = 2- or 3-year excess return on
high-yield bonds over like-maturity Treasuries. HYSt is the fraction of nonfinancial corporate bond
issuance with a high-yield rating from Moody’s, as defined in Greenwood and Hanson (2013).
Credit Growtht is the percentage change in outstanding corporate credit and is computed using
Table L103 from the Flow of Funds. Easy Creditt is the three-year average of the percentage of
bank loan officers reporting a loosening of commercial lending standards from the Federal
Reserve’s Senior Loan Office Opinion Survey. −1 × EBPt is negative one times the excess bond
premium from Gilchrist and Zakrajšek (2012). t-statistics for k-period forecasting regressions (in
brackets) are based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors, allowing for serial correlation up to
k-lags.
