ABSTRACT
Economic theory assigns a central role to risk preferences. This paper develops a measure of relative
risk tolerance using responses to hypothetical income gambles in the Health and Retirement Study.
In contrast to most survey measures that produce an ordinal metric, this paper shows how to construct
a cardinal proxy for the risk tolerance of each survey respondent. The paper also shows how to account
for measurement error in estimating this proxy and how to obtain consistent regression estimates despite
the measurement error. The risk tolerance proxy is shown to explain differences in asset allocation
across households.

INTRODUCTION

Choices with uncertain outcomes, such as financial investments, career paths, and health
practices, are numerous and important to welfare. Empirical studies of these behaviors
often suffer from a common weakness — the inability to take into account heterogeneity
in preferences. In this paper, we develop a quantitative proxy for risk tolerance based on
responses from a large-scale survey to account for this heterogeneity. We then use the proxy
to study asset allocation.
Our measurement of risk tolerance is based on individuals’ responses to questions about
hypothetical risky choices. In particular, we ask them to choose between a job with a certain
lifetime income and a job with a random, but higher mean lifetime income. We show how
to translate these ordinal responses into a cardinal proxy for risk tolerance. To construct
this proxy and use it to study behavior, we confront a number of issues. First, the survey
responses about gambles over lifetime income imply a range instead of a point value for
the unobserved cardinal preference parameter. Second, the survey responses are likely to
be subject to measurement error. We develop a statistical model addressing both issues.
Multiple responses from some individuals and refinements to the survey questions isolate
the true variation in risk preferences. With the maximum-likelihood estimates, we compute
the proxy value — the expectation of risk tolerance conditional on survey responses — for
each individual. Based on a small set of survey questions, the proxy may not fully capture
the systematic variation in risk preferences. This induces a nonstandard errors-in-variables
problem in regression estimates that use the proxy as an explanatory variable. We provide
an estimator using the proxy that is consistent despite errors in variables.
The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the survey questions on lifetime income gambles and the distribution of responses in the Health and Retirement Study.
(See http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu for information on the survey.) Section 3 shows how to
construct the cardinal proxy for risk tolerance from these survey responses and Section 4
addresses the presence of survey response error. Researchers will be able to use such a proxy

as an explanatory variable in studying a wide range of behaviors. In Section 5, we show
how to estimate consistently the effect of the preference parameter on behavior. Section 6
applies these procedures to study the asset allocation decision. Our results show that our
improved measure of risk preference significantly alters the estimated effects of risk tolerance
and other observable characteristics on asset allocation. The final section offers conclusions.

SURVEYING RISK PREFERENCES

The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a large-scale, biennial survey, which began in
1992 with a representative sample of individuals between ages 51 to 61 and their spouses. In
addition to detailed financial and demographic information, the study elicits risk preferences
using a battery of questions developed by Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997).
The Panel Study of Income Dynamics, National Longitudinal Study, Surveys of Consumers,
Dutch CentERpanel, and Chilean Social Security Survey have also fielded these gambles over
lifetime income. In hypothetical scenarios, respondents choose between a certain job and
a risky job. With equal chances, the risky job will double lifetime income or cut lifetime
income by a specific fraction (or downside risk). Varying the downside risk on the new job
in subsequent questions refines the measure of risk preferences.
Specifically, in 1992 the HRS poses the following scenario:
Suppose that you are the only income earner in the family, and you have a good
job guaranteed to give you your current (family) income every year for life. You
are given the opportunity to take a new and equally good job, with a 50-50
chance it will double your (family) income and a 50-50 chance that it will cut
your (family) income by a third. Would you take the new job?
Individuals accepting this new, risky job then consider one with a higher downside risk:
Suppose the chances were 50-50 that it would double your (family) income, and
50-50 that it would cut it in half. Would you still take the new job?
Those initially declining the new job consider one with a lower downside risk:
2

Suppose the chances were 50-50 that it would double your (family) income and
50-50 that it would cut it by 20 percent. Would you then take the new job?
These two responses order individuals in four categories: unwilling to risk a one-fifth income
cut, willing to risk at most a one-third cut, willing to risk a one-third to a one-half cut, and
willing to risk at least a one-half cut. In 1994 a randomly selected sub-sample answered the
questions again. In 1994 and later implementations, there were additional questions about
the willingness to accept one-tenth and three-quarter cuts. With these additional gambles,
there are six distinct response categories. The first two columns of Table 1 relate these
response categories to the downside risks of the new jobs. In Section 3, we will discuss the
last two columns of Table 1 that relate the response categories to the preference parameter.
In general, the gambles over lifetime income reveal a low tolerance for risk. As reported
in Table 2, almost two-thirds of the respondents in 1992 are in the least risk tolerant category
1-2. The remaining one-third of respondents divide almost equally among the other three
categories. The distribution of risk categories in 1994 follows a similar pattern. Over 60%
of respondents fall in categories 1 or 2 with most choosing the least risk tolerant category 1.
Repeated observations from some individuals will be central to our statistical strategy for
separating signal from noise in the survey responses. Among the 693 respondents who answer
in the gambles in both the HRS 1992 and 1994, the correlation of the response categories
across the two waves is 0.27 and almost half switch response categories. Altogether, the
survey responses suggest substantial and persistent differences in risk preferences across
individuals, but also large changes in responses within individuals across surveys.
The 1998 HRS introduced a new situational frame for the income gambles to remove
the potential for status-quo bias. In the original question, individuals choose between their
current certain job and a new risky job. An unwillingness to switch jobs may reflect their
aversion to the risky income at the new job or their desire to maintain the status quo. Status
quo bias appears to be a common feature in many settings (Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988).
In the presence of status quo bias, estimates from the original question would understate
3

individuals’ true risk tolerance. Using a pilot study of undergraduates, Barsky et al. (1997)
estimate average risk tolerance to be 24% lower with responses to the original question than
with responses to an alternate question free of status quo bias. In 1998, 2000, and 2002, the
HRS fielded a status-quo-bias-free question, in which individuals choose between two new
jobs. The question wording is
Suppose that you are the only income earner in the family. Your doctor recommends that you move because of allergies, and you have to choose between two
possible jobs.
The first would guarantee your current total family income for life. The second
is possibly better paying, but the income is also less certain. There is a 50-50
chance the second job would double your total lifetime income and a 50-50 chance
that it would cut it by a third. Which job would you take — the first job or the
second job?
As in the original version, follow-up questions vary the downside risk of the second job
and responses assign individuals to one of six categories. Starting in 2000, the job-related
gambles are targeted to individuals less than age 65. The final three columns of Table
2 shows the responses to the status-quo-bias-free question. In this paper, we restrict the
sample to original respondents of the HRS who answered the gambles in 1992 or 1994. The
respondents in 1998 to the new question do appear more risk tolerant with only 56.9% in
category 1-2 compared to 64.6% in 1992 and 61.5% in 1994. This difference disappears in the
last two survey waves. Nonetheless, variation in the question wording allows us to estimate
the status-quo bias and question-specific responses errors.
This approach to measuring risk preference from hypothetical gambles in the HRS differs
fundamentally from earlier survey measurement of attitudes toward risk. Other surveys
commonly use categorical responses with vague quantifiers to probe risk preferences. For
example, beginning in 1983, the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) asks respondents:
Which of the statements comes closest to the amount of financial risk that you
and your (spouse/partner) are willing to take when you save or make investments?
4

1. take substantial financial risks expecting to earn substantial returns
2. take above average financial risks expecting to earn above average returns
3. take average financial risks expecting to earn average returns
4. not willing to take any financial risks
While intended to order respondents by their risk tolerance, the subjective wording may
generate uninterpretable variation. Since individuals must define “substantial,” “above average,” and “average” financial risks and returns, we cannot quantify differences across responses. In contrast, the income gambles on the HRS supply objective boundaries between
risk categories. In the next section, we use economic theory to map survey responses to a
cardinal proxy for risk tolerance.
Using the cardinal proxy has several advantages. First, it provides a unidimensional,
quantitative measure of risk tolerance that allows meaningful interpersonal comparisons.
Second, in many settings, such as the demand for risky assets that we study in Section
6, economic theory makes predictions that link risk preference parameters quantitatively
to economic decisions. Third, by having a quantitative measure we can correct for the
measurement error inevitable with proxies based on survey responses.
3.

CONSTRUCTING A CARDINAL PROXY

Expected utility theory provides a cardinal metric for risk preference — the coefficient of
relative risk tolerance. Denote an individual’s concave utility function over original lifetime
income as U (W ). Faced with 50-50 gambles of doubling lifetime income or cutting it by
various fractions π, an individual should accept the risky job when its expected utility
exceeds the utility from the certain job — that is, if

0.5U (2W ) + 0.5U ((1 − π)W ) ≥ U (W ).

(1)

The greater the curvature of U , the smaller the downside risk π an individual will accept. Associating gamble responses more tightly with underlying risk tolerance requires a parametric
5

utility function.
We assume that constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) well approximates individuals’
utility over lifetime income

U (W ) =

W 1−1/θ
1 − 1/θ

(2)

where the coefficient of relative risk tolerance θ may differ across individuals. This form
implies that relative risk tolerance, θ = −U ′ /W U ′′ (Pratt 1964), is constant across all values
of lifetime income for a given individual. Analysis of the gamble responses with household
income and wealth supports this utility specification (Sahm 2007). We focus on relative risk
tolerance θ rather than relative risk aversion 1/θ because relative risk tolerance is linearly
related to demand for risky financial assets (Breeden 1979). While the survey does not
directly measure risk tolerance, the responses to the income gambles with this utility function
establish boundaries on the underlying preference parameter.
To illustrate how to bound risk tolerance, consider individuals in response category 3. By
accepting the risky job when the downside risk is one-fifth, but declining when the downside
risk is one-third, these individuals reveal risk tolerance between 0.27 and 0.50. Each bound
for this category equates the expected utility of a new risky job and the current certain job:

0.5
0.5

21−1/θ3
(4/5)1−1/θ3
11−1/θ3
+ 0.5
=
→ θ3 = 0.27
1 − 1/θ3
1 − 1/θ3
1 − 1/θ3

(2/3)1−1/θ3
11−1/θ3
21−1/θ3
+ 0.5
=
→ θ3 = 0.50.
1 − 1/θ3
1 − 1/θ3
1 − 1/θ3

(3)
(4)

Substituting the largest downside risk accepted and smallest risk rejected from Table 1,
we similarly determine the lower and upper bounds for the other categories. The last two
columns of Table 1 report the bounds for each response category. The categories exhaust
the possible range of risk tolerance.
In the next section, we consider a more general model that accounts for measurement
6

error and other features of the question. To illustrate how we map the discrete responses into
a continuous distribution, assume that true risk tolerance follows a log-normal distribution,

log θ ≡ x ∼ N (µ, σx2 ).

(5)

The lognormal functional form has several advantages. First, it imposes the restriction
that relative risk tolerance is nonnegative. Second, it is parsimonious and computationally
simple. Third, we are able to use the moment generating function of the normal to calculate
analytically the unconditional and conditional expectations of θ = exp(x). Finally, the
lognormal appears to fit the data well. It can capture the fact that the modal value of
relative risk tolerance is close to zero but that a substantial fraction of individuals have
higher risk tolerance.
We use standard maximum likelihood methods to estimate the mean µ and variance σx2
of log risk tolerance in the population. Consider first a case in which we observe one response
category c for each individual. The probability of being in category j is






P(c = j) = P(log θj < x < log θj ) = Φ (log θj − µ)/σx − Φ (log θj − µ)/σx



(6)

where Φ(·) is the cumulative normal distribution function. Maximizing the sample loglikelihood of the individuals’ first gamble response, yields a mean log risk tolerance of −1.98
and a standard deviation of 1.76 as reported in the first column of Table 3. These parameters
are precisely estimated: both have an asymptotic standard error of 0.03. For the maximumlikelihood estimation, we use the modified method of scoring where the sample average of
the outer product of the score function approximates the information matrix.
For many applications, it is valuable to assign a numerical risk tolerance proxy for each
individual conditional on his or her survey responses. Using the estimated population parameters, we can impute log risk tolerance conditional on a survey response in category j

function we can impute risk tolerance as

Given the parameter estimates, the proxy, h = E(θ|c), has four values, 0.083, 0.367, 0.706,
and 3.687 for individuals in response categories 1-2, 3, 4, and 5-6. Unlike ordinal rankings,
this proxy quantifies the average difference in log risk tolerance across the risk categories.

ADDRESSING SURVEY RESPONSE ERROR

Responses to hypothetical income gambles likely provide a noisy signal of true risk tolerance.
Thus the risk tolerance proxy from the previous section is also error-prone. Statistical
procedures that use the risk tolerance proxy will be subject to errors-in-variables problems. In
particular, using the proxy as an explanatory variable in a regression will lead to attenuation
biases and inconsistent coefficient estimates. Since a key aim of including the risk questions
on large-scale surveys is to provide researchers with a means to control for heterogeneity in
preferences, it is critical to address and correct for the consequences of survey response error.
That some individuals give multiple responses to the risk tolerance questions provides
a lever for quantifying survey response error. By making the structural assumption that
preferences are immutable, we attribute the common component in an individual’s answers
to true preference and the changes to response error. Recall that x = log(θ) is the individual’s
true preference parameter. With two versions of the gamble question, we also incorporate a
question-specific persistent response error. The survey response error in wave w to question

8

type q is a normal disturbance ǫqw added to x that leads the individual to choose the gamble
response category corresponding to the sum ξqw . The error ǫqw can be interpreted either as
an individual’s misperception of his or her risk tolerance or an error the individual makes in
calculating the bounds (θj , θj ) that map preferences into the gambles. Hence

ξqw = x + ǫqw = x + bq + κq + eqw

(9)

where bq is a common bias across individuals of question type q, κq is the individual’s
persistent response error for question type q, and eqw is the individual’s transitory response
error for a particular wave w and question type q. The components are distributed as
2
2
2
2
ξqw ∼ N (µ + bq , σq2 ), κq ∼ N (0, σκq
), and eqw ∼ N (0, σeq
) with σq2 = σx2 + σκq
+ σeq
. The

covariance in responses across waves for different question types depends only on the variance
of true risk tolerance. For the same question type, the variance of the persistent error
also affects the covariance across waves. We assume that the survey response error is a
purely random — or “classical” — measurement error. Specifically, the response error ǫqw is
independent of an individual’s true risk tolerance and any other attributes.
We analyze the two question types, the original question o and the status-quo-bias-free
question f , so q ∈ {o, f }. In each wave, only one question type is asked. We assume that
the new version is not subject to status quo bias on average, so bf = 0 and ξf w ∼ N (µ, σf2 ).
Identification of the parameters requires that at least some individuals answer the gambles
more than once and some of the multiple responders answer the same question type more
than once. Of the 11,616 individuals in our sample, all answer the original question at least
once and 4,244 individuals answer a status-quo-bias-free question. There are 693 individuals
who answer the original question twice. For the bias-free question, 471 individuals answer
in two surveys and 278 in three surveys.
In Section 3, we discuss how an individual with true log risk tolerance x will be assigned
to a category by responses to the survey questions. Survey response error can move the

9

individual into a different category from wave to wave and affects assignment to response
categories even for those who answer only in one wave. For individuals who respond in only
one wave, the likelihood of category j is


P (cw = j) = Φ

log θj − µ − bq
σq





−Φ



log θj − µ − bq
.
σq

(10)

This likelihood depends on the variance of error-prone risk tolerance, σq2 , not that of true
risk tolerance, σx2 . Obviously, if all individuals answered in only one wave to one question
type, the problem is under-identified.
For those answering the income gambles in both waves, the probability of observing
category j in wave w and category k in wave w′ is

P (cw = j, cw′ = k) =

→
−
→
−
Φ (N jq , N kq′ , ρ) + Φ (N jq , N kq′ , ρ)
→
−
→
−
− Φ (N jq , N kq′ , ρ) − Φ (N jq , N kq′ , ρ)

(11)

→
−
where Φ (·) is the bivariate normal cumulative distribution function, N jq = (log θj − µ −
bq )/σq , N kq′ = (log θk −µ−b′q )/σq′ , N jq = (log θj −µ−bq )/σq , and N kq′ = (log θk −µ−b′q )/σq′ .
When the question type is the same, that is, q = q ′ , the correlation, ρ, between the variables
2
ξqw and ξqw′ is the fraction (σx2 + σkq
)/σq2 of the total variance of the error-prone variable due

to true log relative risk tolerance plus the question-specific persistent response error. When
the question types differ, that is, q 6= q ′ , the correlation is σx2 /σq σq′ where the covariance
depends only on the variation in true log relative risk tolerance. Unlike the typical multiple
indicator solution to the errors-in-variables problem, identification here does not require
repeat observations from all individuals in the sample.
Maximizing the sample log-likelihood with respect to µ, σx , σκo , σκf , σeo , and σef yields
consistent estimates of the parameters. The second column of Table 3 reports the estimates.
The estimated mean of log risk tolerance −1.84 is somewhat higher in this model with
10

multiple gamble responses and question-specific response errors. The original question type is
associated with an 11% lower reported risk tolerance. While this status quo bias is relatively
modest, it is statistically different from zero. A more substantial shift occurs in the estimated
variation of true log risk tolerance, as the estimate of the standard deviation falls to 0.73
from 1.76. Most of this decline is from modeling transitory response error using multiple
gamble responses of some individuals. The modeling of question-specific persistent response
error also lowers the estimated heterogeneity in true preferences somewhat. Together this
implies a much lower estimate of mean risk tolerance in the population: 0.21 instead of
0.65. The variability from response error greatly exceeds that from true risk tolerance. This
finding highlights the limited test-retest reliability of the gambles and the need for multiple
responses from some individuals. Nonetheless, the income gambles still convey much useful
information on preferences as the application in Section 6 validates.
Ignoring survey response error overstates the heterogeneity in risk preferences. As noted,
this causes an upward bias in estimated average risk tolerance. This effect is not dependent
on the lognormal specification. Given the nonnegativity of risk tolerance, noise will in
general shift the mean of the distribution of exp(ξ) to the right. Figure 1 illustrates the
effects of response error. The solid line is the empirical distribution of the discrete responses
in 1992 from Table 2 using the bounds (θj , θj ) in Table 1. The solid curve is the fitted
lognormal distribution of true risk tolerance θ = exp(x). The dashed curve is the fitted
lognormal distribution of the true parameter plus noise, exp(x + ǫ). The figure shows how
the distribution of the true parameter moves mass away from the extremes relative to the
distribution that includes noise from response errors.
Table 4 summarizes additional features of the estimated distribution of true risk preferences based on the parameter estimates in the second column of Table 3. The first column
shows the distribution of log risk tolerance. The second column shows the distribution of the
level of risk tolerance. The estimated mode of 0.094 indicates that the bulk of respondents
have very low risk tolerance. Yet, there are enough respondents with relatively high risk
11

tolerance to pull the mean substantially above the mode. About 25% of respondents are
estimated to have risk tolerance greater than or equal to 0.259, and about 10% have risk
tolerance greater than 0.402. Yet, virtually no respondents have risk tolerance as high as
one (logarithmic utility).
For many applications — notably demand for risky assets — relative risk tolerance θ
is the relevant preference parameter (Breeden 1979; Barsky, Juster, Kimball and Shapiro
1997). But in other applications, such as the strength of the precautionary saving motive, its
reciprocal 1/θ, relative risk aversion, would be the parameter of interest (Carroll and Kimball
Forthcoming). When preferences are heterogeneous across individuals, the reciprocal of
average relative risk tolerance is not equal to the average of its reciprocal. The last column
of Table 4 gives the parameters and fractiles of the distribution of relative risk aversion. For
our parameter estimates, average relative risk tolerance is 0.206. The estimated average of
relative risk aversion is 8.2, which is far greater than 1/0.206 = 4.9. This difference between
the expectation of the reciprocal and the reciprocal of the expectation is a powerful example
of Jensen’s inequality. Jensen’s inequality gets its bite in this application from the substantial
heterogeneity in preferences, the concavity of the 1/θ function, and the concentrated mass
of the probability density near zero, where the function 1/θ is most curved.
Many researchers will want to impute risk tolerance for individuals. As our proxy for
individual risk preference, we calculate the expected risk tolerance conditional on an individual’s responses, using the estimated distributional parameters of our statistical model.
The formula is similar to equation (8) in Section 3 except that it now accounts for questionspecific response error and multiple responses to the gamble questions. Table 5 reports the
proxy values of risk tolerance, as well as of log risk tolerance and risk aversion, for respondents to one status-quo-bias-free question. The proxy of risk tolerance for response category
1 (reject job with one-tenth downside risk) is 0.153. The range of relative risk tolerance
corresponding to those preferences is from 0 to 0.13. (See Table 1.) Hence, the proxy value
for this response lies slightly higher than the range. For risk category 2, the proxy of 0.203
12

lies near the center of the range from 0.13 to 0.27. With the more risk tolerant response
categories, the proxy values are substantially lower than the range. For example, category 5
(accept a job with one-third downside risk but reject a job with one-half downside risk), the
proxy of 0.301 lies far below the low end of the range from 1.0 to 3.7. The proxy values of log
risk tolerance and risk aversion follow a similar pattern, as do the proxies from a response to
the original question type. Hence, correcting for response error shifts the proxy toward the
unconditional mean. Yet, substantial heterogeneity and meaningful quantitative differences
remain even after this correction.
For those answering in multiple waves, we use all their responses to sharpen the estimate of their relative risk tolerance. These additional responses greatly widen the range
of proxy values. The lowest imputed value of risk tolerance in our sample is 0.087 and
the highest value is 0.732. When individuals give different responses across waves, we
adjust the proxy values accordingly.

Table 5 contains only a small subset of the 370

unique proxy values observed in this sample. For researchers who wish to make imputations based on our parameter values for any possible response to the HRS questions,
we provide a spreadsheet of all possible values of risk tolerance and risk aversion online
(http://www.umich.edu/~shapiro/data/risk_preference).

STUDYING BEHAVIOR WITH THE PROXY

A major application of our proxy for risk tolerance is its use as a regressor to control for
heterogeneity in preferences when studying a wide range of behaviors. The proxy h = E(θ|c)
is the conditional expectation of true risk tolerance. Hence, the deviation of the proxy from
the true variable u = θ−h is not a classical measurement error. In particular, the deviation is
correlated with the true variable, not the proxy. In this section, we discuss the non-standard
errors-in-variables problem that arises from use of the proxy and present an estimator that
addresses this problem.

13

To study the effects of risk tolerance and other regressors on behavior, consider a model

y = θδθ + zδz + ν

(12)

where θ is true risk tolerance and z is a 1×K vector of observables that also affect the behavior
of interest y. To simplify later analysis, all variables are expressed as deviations from their
means. We make the assumptions that, conditional on the regressors, the population error
is mean zero, E(ν|θ, z) = 0, and that the expected outer product matrix of (θ, z) has full
rank. If we observed true risk tolerance and the other regressors, OLS would consistently
estimate the population parameters, δ = (δθ , δz′ )′ .
Now consider the use of the proxy. Substituting the proxy h = E(θ|c) in (12), we have

y = hδθ + zδz + η

(13)

η = uδθ + ν.

(14)

where

The composite error term η includes an expectation error u = θ − h and the structural
error term ν. Unlike a classical measurement error, the deviation u of the proxy from the
true variable is uncorrelated with the proxy h and correlated with the true variable θ. This
implies that in a univariate linear regression of a dependent variable y on only the proxy h,
there is no attenuation bias and the OLS coefficient is consistent.
In a multivariate setting, the OLS estimator using the proxy is unlikely to provide consistent estimates of the population parameters, δ = (δθ , δz′ )′ . The proxy of risk tolerance
h = E(θ|c) only conditions on an individual’s gamble response categories, so regressors z
that are correlated with true risk tolerance θ would also correlate with the expectation error u. For example, men may be more risk tolerant than women. Then gender would be
correlated with the expectation error. Using the proxy with a standard set of demographic

14

regressors, the OLS coefficient estimate for men would mix the direct effects of gender with
the indirect effects of risk tolerance. A more general statement of the problem is that

E(z′ h) 6= E(z′ θ) .

(15)

The lack of equality in (15) arises because of the correlation between the proxy’s expectation
error u and the regressors z, which also implies that OLS is inconsistent.
We have enough structure on the problem to derive moment conditions that will allow for
a consistent estimator using the proxy. The assumption of purely random response error and
the properties of conditional expectations imply that the proxy is uncorrelated with both
the structural error term ν and the expectation error u. This yields the following moment
condition for the proxy:

E(hη) = E(hu)δθ + E(hν) = 0 .

(16)

To formulate a moment condition for the other observables, we assume that the conditional
expectation of each observable zk in the vector z is linear in risk tolerance, such that

zk = θβk + ζ

(17)

where E(ζ|θ) = 0 and βk = E(θ2 )−1 E(θzk ). The linear specification serves as a good
approximation and could be extended to a risk tolerance vector that includes higher order
terms. With purely random response error, ζ is independent of the response error ǫ, which
together with θ determines the proxy h. This implies that E(hζ) = 0. By definition, the
proxy h is also uncorrelated with the expectation error u = θ − h. Substituting the proxy in
(17), we have

zk = hβk + uβk + ζ
15

(18)

so the regression of zk on the proxy h consistently estimates βk , that is, βk = E(θ2 )−1 E(θzk ) =
E(h2 )−1 E(hzk ). We define the true-to-proxy variance ratio as
λ = E(θ2 )/E(h2 ).

(19)

It follows that

E(θzk ) = βk E(θ2 ) = βk λE(h2 ) = λE(hzk )

for all zk ∈ z

(20)

where the first equality uses the population estimate of βk in terms of θ, the second equality
uses the definition of λ, and the third equality uses the population estimate of βk in terms
of h. We restate the model in (12) with the proxy h adjusted by λ as

y = λhδθ + zδz + ω

(21)

ω = (θ − λh)δθ + ν.

(22)

where

With (16) and (20), we have two sets of orthogonality conditions which identify the
model:

E(hη) = E[h(y − hδθ − zδz )] = 0

(23)

E(z′ ω) = E[z′ (y − λhδθ − zδz )] = 0.

(24)

The second orthogonality condition effectively multiples the covariance of z with the proxy
h by the variance ratio λ to get the implied covariance of z with θ.
The estimator of δ will be based on the sample estimates of the proxy h and the true-toproxy variance ratio λ. We can implement this GMM estimator because we have an estimate
of λ from the maximum-likelihood estimation. This situation contrasts with standard errors16

in-variables setting where the true-to-proxy variance ratio is unidentified. Substituting the
sample analogs into the moment conditions and solving for the estimates gives

Under the conditions specified, these will be consistent estimates of δ and have a limiting
normal distribution. Note the ratio λ in the lower left block of the inverted matrix. There
are three cases in which this estimator is identical to the OLS estimator: first, when there
are no regressors other than risk tolerance; second, when none of the other regressors are
correlated with true risk tolerance; and third, when there is no expectation error for the
proxy, i.e., θ = h, so λ = 1. Taking into account that the proxy variance is attenuated with
respect to the true preference parameter is important in multivariate models with strong
correlations between the other regressors and risk tolerance.

Using the standard R2 from a regression with the proxy would understate the explanatory
17

power of the model, since the variability of the proxy understates the true variability of
risk tolerance. Table 6 shows that this understatement is substantial. The ratio λ of the
variance of the true risk tolerance to the proxy is 6.32. When the other regressors are
strongly correlated with risk tolerance, the GMM estimator in (25) and the implied R2 in
(28) will more accurately characterize the effects of risk tolerance on behavior than standard
estimators. Even in a univariate regression on risk tolerance alone, equation (28) is needed
to calculate the implied R2 .

APPLICATION TO ASSET ALLOCATION

In this section, we apply the methods discussed above to study asset allocation. Faced with
uncertain asset returns, risk preferences should be central in allocating financial wealth between high risk and low risk assets. Individuals with greater risk tolerance should be willing
to hold a larger fraction of their wealth in risky assets, such as stocks. Under complete
markets, only risk tolerance and the distribution of risky asset returns affect allocations
(Samuelson 1969; Merton 1969). Many individuals also anticipate labor income, which they
cannot fully capitalize due to their ability to sort across contracts by their risk type (adverse
selection) and to alter their post-contract behavior (moral hazard). With market incompleteness, models of asset allocation also identify a role for the determinants of future labor
income, such as age and the distribution of income shocks (Heaton and Lucas 1997). Empirical studies often document substantial differences in asset allocation by gender, education,
and race. Nonetheless, much of the heterogeneity in asset allocation remains unexplained.
In contrast with other empirical studies of asset allocation, our risk tolerance proxy allows
us to control quantitatively for the effects of risk preference cross-sectionally. In this section,
using data from the HRS, we present estimates of how the share of financial wealth held
in stocks increases with risk tolerance. We also consider other regressors such as gender,
education, age, race, household income and wealth. While households typically own assets
jointly, many of these attributes are person-specific. We treat the respondent who is most

18

knowledgeable about household finances as the primary decision-maker and control for his
or her attributes. We limit our analysis to households with positive financial wealth and
income. Since the HRS is a sample of older households who have often accumulated some
wealth, this selection eliminates fewer observations than it would in an age-representative
sample. Nonetheless, it does exclude approximately 20% of households. The average share of
financial wealth in stocks (excluding individual retirement accounts) is 0.16 and a significant
portion of households do not own stocks. The standard deviation of the share in stocks is
0.29, so there is considerable dispersion in stock allocations.
To demonstrate the usefulness of our risk tolerance proxy h and the true-to-proxy variance
ratio λ, we contrast our GMM estimates with the OLS estimates that use the risk tolerance
variable without taking into account response error. While focusing on the effects of risk
tolerance, we also discuss the effects of gender and education. We use the estimated effects
from these regressors to demonstrate the misleading inferences from failing to take into
account risk tolerance heterogeneity and also failing to correct for the consequences of survey
response error in the risk tolerance proxy.
As a baseline, we estimate the stock allocation model without any control for risk tolerance. This corresponds to the approach in most empirical studies. As reported in Table
7, the gender, education, and race of the financial respondent as well as the household’s log
income and log financial assets account for 17.0% of the variation in stock allocations. In this
specification, households with men responsible for the finances have 2.4 percentage points
more in stocks on average. Post-college education raises the share by 3.4 percentage points.
Both are statistically significant and represent 15% and 22% of the average stock allocation.
If any of these characteristics correlate with risk tolerance, then their estimated coefficients also include the indirect effects of risk tolerance. One way to try to sort out the
direct effects of risk tolerance on stock holding and to study the confounding effect of gender, education and other regressors is to estimate a model of asset allocation controlling
for the categorical survey responses to the income gambles. Based on their first response
19

in the HRS, we assign individuals to four risk tolerance categories. This regression with
categorical controls explains 17.2% of the variation in stock allocations. Households in the
most risk tolerant category hold 2.5 percentage points more of their wealth in stocks than
those in the least risk tolerant category. But the relationship is nonlinear as households in
the second lowest risk tolerant category hold 2.6 percentage points less in stocks than those
in the least risk tolerant category. Adding the categorical controls diminishes the effect of a
male financial respondent to 2.3 percentage points and post-college education to 3.2. These
results are consistent with the Barsky et al. (1997) finding that men and the most educated
are more risk tolerant. Even partially controlling for risk preferences begins to lower the
estimated effect of these attributes on asset allocation.
The last four columns of estimates in Table 7 use different versions of the cardinal proxy
for risk tolerance and different estimators. In the third column, we use the proxy from Section
3, which ignores survey response error. All else equal, the most risk tolerant households based
on one observation (risk tolerance of 3.687) average 2.9 percentage points more in stocks than
the least risk tolerant households (risk tolerance of 0.049).
The fourth column of Table 7 uses the proxy from Section 4 that accounts for the measurement error in the gamble responses but does not address the potential correlation between
the proxy’s expectation error and the other regressors discussed in Section 5. These results
show that ignoring survey response error greatly understates the marginal effect of risk tolerance on stock allocations. When we use the proxy values from Section 4, the coefficient
estimate for the proxy increases over ten-fold. This increase shows how attenuation bias
affects the estimates in the previous two columns that do not account for response error.
Of course, this correction mainly scales up the coefficient estimate and does not affect the
R2 . The larger estimated effect of risk tolerance means that when risk tolerance is measured
more precisely with multiple responses that the predicted differences in behavior can be substantial. The most risk tolerant households based on multiple observations (risk tolerance
of 0.732) average 9.4 percentage points more wealth in stocks than the least risk tolerant
20

(risk tolerance of 0.087). This difference represents 60% of the average stock share. Thus
correcting for measurement error has a substantial impact on the estimated responsiveness
of behavior to risk tolerance.
The fifth column of Table 7 uses the same proxy for risk tolerance as in the fourth column
but replaces the OLS estimator with the GMM estimator derived in Section 5. The GMM
estimates show the importance of accounting for the correlation between the expectation
error of the proxy and the other regressors. Using formula (28) for the implied R2 , the
explained variation in stock allocations rises to 17.8% from 17.1%. The point estimate for the
effect of risk tolerance rises 11% to 0.162. The average difference in stock allocations of the
most and least risk tolerant households with multiple responses increases over one percentage
point to 10.5. The GMM estimator has a more pronounced effect on the coefficient estimates
for other regressors. As stressed in Section 5, the main issue is that in the OLS estimate the
other regressors will spuriously account for variation in the dependent variable to the extent
that they are correlated with risk tolerance. Having a male financial respondent now raises
stock allocations by only 1.4 percentage points and the effect of a post-college education
falls to 1.2 percentage points. These coefficient estimates are 42% and 65% lower than in
the regression with no measure of risk tolerance and are no longer statistically different from
zero at the 5% level.
As a check on the accuracy of the GMM estimator, the last column of Table 7 looks
at an alternative estimator. Instead of basing the proxy just on the gamble response categories, we also condition on the regressors in this application. Specifically, in the first-step
maximum-likelihood, we model the mean of log risk tolerance µ as a linear function of the
observables z. The estimated unconditional mean and variance of log risk tolerance from this
alternative first-step maximum-likelihood model are reported in the last column of Table 3.
The estimated distribution does not differ substantially from the model that conditions on
only the gamble responses. This is a direct approach to eliminate the correlation between
the proxy’s expectation error and the observables. Condition (15) now holds with equal21

ity and the OLS estimator with this new proxy consistently estimates the model with true
risk tolerance. The last two columns of Table 7 are very similar. This finding implies that
the GMM approach, which does not rely on re-estimating the proxy conditional on all the
covariates in the regressions, works well.
The results in Table 7 demonstrate the importance of carefully controlling for the heterogeneity in preferences. Beyond using the proxy to control for heterogeneity in risk tolerance,
we show how the effect of other regressors can be overstated if no correction is made for
the fact that the proxy is imperfectly measured and the other regressors are correlated with
preferences. For researchers who want to include an individual measure of risk tolerance in
their studies of other behaviors, our maximum-likelihood estimates provide a valid proxy.
To the extent that this proxy’s expectation error is correlated with other explanatory variables of interest, the OLS estimates can be misleading. This problem can be addressed with
the GMM estimator that we derive in Section 5 or can be avoided by conditioning on the
other variables in the first-step maximum-likelihood. While the second alternative might
be the best approach, the Health and Retirement Study is currently the only data set with
a sufficient panel to correct for the survey response error in the gamble responses. When
the first-step maximum-likelihood is not possible (for example, because of having only one
response per individual), the proxy values we provide that condition only on the gamble
responses should be used with the GMM estimator to obtain consistent estimates.
7.

CONCLUSION

We demonstrate the importance of carefully controlling for risk preferences when examining
asset allocation. In particular, our procedures address many issues in using survey-based
measures of risk tolerance — translation of categorical responses to a cardinal metric, survey
response error, and expectation error for the proxy. Our methods for constructing the
proxy and estimating the effects of risk tolerance on behavior have a wide range of potential
applications. A growing number of surveys including the Panel Study of Income Dynamics

22

in the United States, the CentERpanel in the Netherlands, and the Social Security Survey in
Chile have fielded lifetime income gambles like those in the HRS. Our statistical procedures
for constructing the risk tolerance proxy can be applied with minimal adjustment to these
other surveys.
In studies of asset allocation (Vissing-Jorgensen 2002) and intergenerational wealth correlations (Charles and Hurst 2003), researchers have used indicator variables from income
gamble responses. This approach does not fully capture the effect of heterogeneous risk
preferences. According to our empirical analysis, even if the direct effects of risk tolerance
are not central to the study, such indicator variables are unlikely to adequately control for
risk tolerance. In other words, these partial controls are not sufficient either in theory or
practice for consistent estimates of the direct effects of other variables of interest. With
survey questions and statistical techniques motivated by economic theory, we expand the
options for studying the effects of risk preferences on behavior. Using the quantitative proxy
for risk tolerance, we find a strong effect of risk tolerance on stock holding. Moreover, after
accounting for how errors in measured risk tolerance are correlated with other variables, the
estimated effects of gender and education on asset allocation are substantially reduced.

APPENDIX 1: BOOTSTRAP
Both the OLS and GMM estimates in Table 7 use the risk tolerance proxy h, which is a
generated regressor from the first-step maximum-likelihood procedure. The variance ratio λ
is another generated regressor in the GMM estimator. While the coefficient estimates from
these second-step estimators are asymptotically consistent, the estimated standard errors do
not reflect the sampling variation in the proxy and the variance ratio. We use a bootstrap
to show this sampling variation does not qualitatively alter our inferences in Section 6.
Using a Monte Carlo experiment, we draw 199 random samples from the data and repeat
the two steps of estimation in Section 4 and Section 6. Sampling with replacement, we
maintain the distribution of respondents to the original and status-quo-bias-free questions.
We use a symmetric t-test to construct the 95% bootstrap confidence on the proxy coefficient
estimate in the asset allocation model. The OLS estimate in the fourth column of Table 7 of
0.146 has a confidence interval of 0.042 to 0.249. The GMM estimate of in the fifth column
of Table 7 0.162 has a confidence interval of 0.042 to 0.283. The OLS estimate in the sixth
column of Table 7 of 0.152 has a confidence interval of 0.044 to 0.260. In all three cases, the
estimated effect of risk tolerance on asset allocation remains statistically significant at the
5% level. As expected, sampling variation in the generated regressors has little effect on the
inference of the other controls. The moderate impact of the generated regressors reflects the
precision of the first-step maximum likelihood procedure.

NOTE: Respondents choose between a job with a certain income and a job with risky
income. With equal chances, the risky job will double lifetime income or cut it by the
specific fraction shown in the columns labelled downside risk. The largest risk accepted
and smallest risk rejected across gambles define a response category. In 1992 there are four
categories 1-2, 3, 4, and 5-6. In 1994 and later surveys, there are six response categories.
The last two columns show the bounds on relative risk tolerance consistent with these
response categories in the absence of response error.

NOTE: Regressions include 5,818 households with positive financial wealth and total
income in 1992. Individual attributes are from the household’s financial respondent. Share
of wealth in stocks has a mean of 0.158 and a standard deviation of 0.286. Asymptotic
standard errors are in parentheses. In the second to last column the GMM estimates are
based on the formula in (25) and the R2 in the last two columns is based on the formula in
(28). For the application sub-sample, the true-to-proxy variance ratio λ is 6.40. In the last
column, the proxy is constructed from a model of log risk tolerance that conditions on the
application covariates as well as the gamble responses.

Relative Risk Tolerance

NOTE: The solid line shows the empirical distribution of the survey responses. The solid
curve shows the fitted distribution of the true level of risk tolerance: θ = exp(x) using the
model from Section 4. The dashed curved shows the fitted empirical distribution:
exp(ξ) = exp(x + ǫ).
