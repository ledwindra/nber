    "abstract": "\n\nWe analyze a financial collapse, such as the one which occurred during the Great Depression, from the perspective of a monetary model with multiple equilibria.  The economy we consider contains financial fragility due to increasing returns to scale in the intermediation process.  Intermediaries provide the link between savers and firms who require working capital for production.  Fluctuations in the intermediation process are driven by variations in the confidence agents place in the financial system.  Our model matches quite closely the qualitative movements in some financial and real variables (the currency/deposit ratio, ex-post real interest rates, the level of intermediated activity, deflation, employment and production) during the Great Depression period.\n\n",
