Causal Relationships between Inf ant Mortality and
Fertility in Developed and Less Developed Countries

Tadashi Yamada*
I. INTRODUCTION

"Fertility reduction seems to be a nearly universal feature of
the development of modern secular societies,.. ,•l,2 The lagged
response of fertility to reductions in mortality (manifested in the
lack of coordinated fertility control programs) have historically

resulted in high growth rates of population in the less developed
countries, e.g., Latin American countries (Arriaga 1970)

3

Over the past two decades, the causal relationships between

infant mortality and fertility have been a controversial issue
(Beer 1983 and Scrimshaw 1978)

Since the direction of this

causality is not established on empirical grounds, many existing
estimates of fertility demand functions and infant survival
production and demand functions are marred by simultaneous equa-

tion bias. The purpose of this study is to examine the dynamic
relationships between infant mortality and fertility by applying
time series techniques to the annual data on these variables for
economically developed countries and for economically less developed countries.

First, I examine causal relationships within a two—variable
model--infant mortality and fertility rates-—for asainpie of
economically developed countries, including the Western European
countries of Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, and the united Kingdom (the U.K.), and the United States

—2—

(U.S.A.). The tine periods studied are: 1939—7k for most of the
European countries, 1942—75 and 1944-75 for the U.K., and 1923—
77 for U.S.A.4

Second, I examine dynamic responses within a larger—scale
dynamic system that includes per capita real income, total morta—
lity rate, infant mortality rate, and birth rate, for three Latin

American countries, Uruguay, Chile, and Costa Rica.5 Each of
these three countries experienced some economic development before

World War II. While Uruguay has now, essentially, passed through
its demographic transition, Chile is still in the midst of its

era of transition having entered it in the early 1960s. Costa
Rica, on the other hand, has just begun its era of fertility dec-

line (Oechsli and Kirk 1975). In addition, Uruguay and Chile
have been heavily affected by European migration. These similar
rities and differences should be useful in illuminating the nature
of the dynamic relationship between infant mortality and fertility.

According to the theory of demographic transition, mortality
decline occurs along with an increase in industrialization and
urbanization, a diffusion of medical technology, and rises in
literacy and living standards (Davis 1945 and Pitchford 1974).
With some time lag, the reduction in mortality triggers a subse-

quent fall in fertility. The positive association between the
length of post-partum amenorrhea and the duration of breast feeding are the biological and physiological causal effects of a
decline in infant mortality that reduces fertility (Chen et al.

—3—
1974, Ginneken 1974, and Potter 1963).6 The prolonged lacta-

tion due to the reduction in infant mortality has an important
ferti—
fertility reducing effect. For the behavioral responses of
Pakistan
lity behavior, Chowdhury et al. (1976) in their study for
the
and Bangladesh as well as May and Heer (1968) for India support
Olsen (1980) finds the child rep—

child survival hypothesisi while

lacement effect for Colombia.

Heer (1983) argues that the magnifertility behavior will depend

tude of the responses of couples!

on their preference for

the lost child's sex and the surviving

children's sexes and number as well as the perceived monetary and
Sun (1978)
psychic costs of birth controls. For example, Coombsañd

and Heer and Wu (1975) find that in Taiwan, births that follow
the
previous child deaths are higher when the losses are male and
surviving children are female, because of the strong preference
for sons.

On the other hand, in the

Maithusian theory, a rise in real

marriwages above a subsistence level reduces the average age of
to cause
age and increases the fertility rate, which is expected
high
an increase in mortality rates with some lag. In general,
births
fertility rates are responsible for high risk births, e.g.,

to young mothers and old mothers, fourth and higher-order births,

illegitimate births, and low birth-weight births (Omran and
standley 1976 and Woodbury 1925).

In some areas of Germany where

posibreast feeding was uncommon in the 19th century, the strong
tive correlation between marital fertility and infant mortality
l968).8
is attributed to the short intervals of births (Knodel

—'4—

Finally, the modern economic theory of population emphasizes an interdependency between inf ant mortality and fertility.

Parents devote their time and provide medical care and nutriti-

ous food for their infant. The parents' decision on the allocation of resources will consequently determine the outcome of the
infant's health. Therefore, the child quality, e.g., inf ant health
status, and the number of children are jointly determined-by
the parents (Becker and Lewis 1973 and Willis 1973)

These three contrasting views of the causal relationships
between infant mortality and fertility do not provide researchers
an a priori notion of whether they should treat infant mortality
and fertility rates purely exogenously or endogenously in their

models. To establish the dynamic relationships between the two,
it is worthwhile and natural to apply time series techniques
developed by Granger (1969) and Sims (1980) to the data on infant
mortality and fertility rates.
The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows:

Section II describes briefly the time series techniques used to
observe causal and dynamic relationships between variables-in a

system. Section III reports the empirical results. Finally,
section IV gives a summary of this study.

—5—
II. STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF CAUSALITY TEST
The Granger—Causality is defined as follows: A stationary stocha-

stic tine series, X, causes another stationary

stochastic time

series, 1, within a set of information in the universe, if the
current value of Y is more accurately predicted by using the information that includes at least the own—tiast series of Y and the past

series of x than by using the information that excludes the past
series of X (Granger 1969).
To carry out the Granger—causality test. the vector autoregressive (VAR) model is estimated, e.g., in a simple two—variable
model, as follows:

+

Eb(s)INF(t—s)

+

e(t)

(1)

INF(t) c0 + Ec(s)FE(t—5) +

Ed(s)INF(t—s)

+

e*(t)

(2)

FE(t) = a0 +

Ea(s)FE(t—s)

where FEC') and INF(') are stationary stochastic time series of
fertility and infant mortality rates, respectively; and eC') and

e*() are white—noise error terms, which are called the innovations in fertility and infant mortality rates in the VAR model,
respectively.

In order to test the Granger—causality from INF to FE in
the VAR model. the null hypothesis is that the set of parameters
b(s), s=l,2,... ,m, should be zero if there is no Granger—caUsa—

lity from the causal variable INF to FE. By the same manner,

—6—
for the test of the Granger—causality from FE to INF in the model,
the set of parameters c(s), =l,21...,m, should be zero if there

is no Granger—causality from FE to INF.9
After estimating the above VAR model with appropriate lag
distributions, the model is inverted to a linear combination of
the innovations in FE and INF in order to compute the responses of
FE (or INF) to typical random shocks in the innovations.

The moving

average (MAR) model is defined as follows:

Z(t) =

EG(S)E(t-s),

(3)

where Z() is a vector of FE and INF; and E() is a vector of the

innovations

-'

in FE and INF, defined as E(t)=Z(t)—.z(t) where Z(t)

represents the best linear forecast of Z(t) based on its past

series Z(t—s), s>o.'° A particular i-th equation of Zft), e.g.,
FE equation in the form of MAR representation, is expressed as
follows:
2

FE(t) =

k

E Eg.(s)e?(t-s)

(4)

j=l s=O

where e"() are the innovations in FE and INF. The sum of ga(s)

from s0 to sk, e.g., the j—th component of e" the innovation
in INF, represents the cumulative resonses of FE in the k+l step—
ahead to random shocks in the innovation in INF.

Concerning the issue of the Granger—causality between infant
mortality (INF) and fertility (FE) in Table 1, the F—statistics

under infant mortality indicate that most of the results of the
Granger—causality from INF to FE are statistically significant. For
the results of Finland and the U.K., we find that there are signif i—
cant improvements in the F—statistics from the three to five lag

distributions. The F—statistics under fertility show that the
Granger—causality from FE to INF for the results of Finland, France,
Norway, Switzerland, the U.K., and U.S.A. are statistically signifi-

cant. We note from the above results that infant mortality and
fertility are not independent but causally related with each other.
In particular, both are jointly determined in Finland, Norway,
Switzerland, the U.K., and U.S.A.13
In Table 2, the cumulative responses of infant mortality rate
(INF) to per capita real income (INC) are negative in Chile,

—8—
Costa Rica, and Uruguay for all time

horizons shown, i.e.? 4, 6,

and 8 years ahead. That is, an increase in per capita real income
will unambiguously lead to a fall in inf ant mortality rate for

these countries. The fall in the infant

mortality rate (INF) conse-

quently triggers a subsequent fall in the birth rate (BIR). The
above dynamic associations show the nexus between changes in infant

mortality and fertility that lies at the heart of the so—called
"demographic transition."

SUMMARY

The aim of this study is twofold: first, it is to answer empirically the question whether infant mortality is historically one
of the significant factors that influenced fertility and vice
versa; and the other is to observe the dynamic responses of fertility to infant mortality.

By using the time series techniques developed by Granger
(1969) and Sims (1980), I have shown that infant mortality and

fertility are not independend but jointly determined. Also, I
have shown that a decline •in infant mortality that is due to

an increase in per capIta real income triggers a subsequent decline

in fertility. This dynamic nexus between changes in infant mortality and fertility lies at the heart of so—called "demographic
transition."

p.208.

2Coale (1967) points out the circumstances associated with
the fertility reduction, e.g., the decline in mortality, the rising costs and diminished economic advantages of children, higher
status of women, religious changes and differences, and the development of a secular, rational attitude (p.208) . Similar arguments can be found in Heer (1968)
3

Researchers such as Frederiksen (1966) , Freedman (1965)
and Freedman et a!. (1974) emphasize the importance of effective

family planning programs for the fertility reduction. This point
is clearly made in the addresses by A. W. Clausen, President of
the World Bank, to the National Leaders' Seminar on Population and
Development in Nairobi, Kenya on July 11, 1984, and the International Population Conference in Mexico City, Mexico on August 7,
1984 (World Bank 1984).
4The data on infant mortality and. fertility rates are annual
time series. The definitions and source are listed in the appendix.
The choice of the countries and the time periods were decided on
the grounds of expediency. More recent data for the European
countries studied were unavailable at the tine when this paper was
under revision.

5The data on the demographic and economic variables are
annual time series. The appendix lists the definitions and source.
6Lactation is not purely biological since its duration is
behaviorally determined (Taylor et al. 1976)
7when infant mortality is treated exogenously in a simple
microeconomic model, the model predicts that the parents will reduce
their desired number of births in response to a fall in infant mortality, if the demand for surviving children is price inelastic
(Schultz l976a and l976b).

F-2

8Knodel and van de Walle (1967) and Wolfers and Scrimshaw
(1975) also support the idea that birth or pregnancy intervals
influence child survival.
9The Granger—causality test might be sensitive to misspecj—
fication, e.g., omitted variables or lag structure in the system.
It is, however, very costly in tens of degrees of freedom to include more variables and/or more lags in the system when only a
small number of time series observations are available to test the
Granger—causality.
101f the components of E are contemporaneously correlated,
it is not possible to partition the variance of Z into pieces
accounted for by each innovation. An orthogonalization for F is,
therefore, made after a triangularization of the system. See
Gordon and King (1982), Litterman (1979), and Sims (1980) in detail.
11

To estimate the system for each country, the VAR model is
estimated in a logarithmic specification with three (or five) lag
distributions. Each equation in the model includes a constant term,
a linear time trend, and two dummy variables such as Dl=l for 1936—
45 and Dl=0 otherwise and D2=l for 1946—50 and D2=0 otherwise.
In the case of the United States, D2=1 for 1923—26 and 1946—55 and
D2=O otherwise, while Dl is similarly defined as above.
12The VAR model is estimated in a logarithmic specification
with three lag distributions, including a constant term and a
linear time trend in each equation of the model. These simulations
are made based on the VAR model for the sample periods of 1951—78
for Uruguay and 1951—79 for Chile and costa Rica.
13

Eckstein et al. (1981) finds a similar result for the
Swedish data during the period 1870—1955.
