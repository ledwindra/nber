ABSTRACT
We propose a tractable and coherent framework that captures both conventional and
unconventional monetary policies with the shadow fed funds rate. Empirically, we document the
shadow rate's resemblance to an overall financial conditions index, various private interest rates,
the Fed's balance sheet, and the Taylor rule. Theoretically, we demonstrate the impact of
unconventional policies, such as QE and lending facilities, on the economy is identical to that of a
negative shadow rate, making the latter a useful summary statistic for these policies. Our model
generates the data-consistent result: a negative supply shock is always contractionary. It also
salvages the New Keynesian model from the zero lower bound induced structural break.

Introduction

The zero lower bound (ZLB) poses a major issue for advanced economies and consequently
economic research. It invalidates the traditional monetary policy tool because central banks
are unable to further lower policy rates. Subsequently, central banks around the world have
introduced unconventional policy tools such as large-scale asset purchases (or QE). How
economic models accommodate the ZLB and unconventional monetary policy has become
the new challenge for economic research. This paper proposes a novel New Keynesian (NK)
model with the shadow rate to address this issue.
Policy makers and economists have documented empirically that the conventional and
unconventional monetary policies work in a similar fashion. Powell (2013) assesses their
cross-border effects, whereas Blanchard (2016) focuses on transmission mechanisms. Wu
and Xia (2016) and Mouabbi and Sahuc (2017) emphasize their impact on domestic financial
conditions and the real economy. Belongia and Ireland (2017) establish a similar link between
nominal GDP and monetary aggregates with or without the ZLB.
The goal of this paper is to echo the empirical findings and propose a coherent and
tractable framework to summarize both the conventional and unconventional policies in the
NK model. One prominent tool that empirical studies and policy analyses have widely
adopted is the shadow rate of Wu and Xia (2016).1 The shadow rate is the federal funds
rate when the ZLB is not binding; otherwise, it is negative to account for unconventional
policy tools. However, the question is how a negative interest rate can be mapped into an
equilibrium concept. We warrant such a choice by (1) microfounding the negative shadow
rate with unconventional policy tools: in a microfounded model, the central bank implements
a conventional Taylor rule during normal times, and some major unconventional monetary
policy when the ZLB binds. We then show unconventional monetary policy has identical

effects on economic quantities as if the policy were implemented through a negative interest
rate. Therefore, a negative shadow rate is not an actual policy instrument, but rather, it can
be perceived as a summary statistic for unconventional monetary policy mapped into the
interest rate domain. (2) We present new evidence to demonstrate the empirical relevance
of the shadow rate, and (3) show that our model produces intuitive and sensible economic
implications.
Our new shadow rate New Keynesian model (SRNKM) proposes the shadow rate as a
tractable summary for all monetary policy tools, conventional or unconventional, allowing the
model to remain linear without a ZLB-induced structural break. The shadow rate replaces
the policy rate entering the IS curve. The ZLB on the Taylor rule is removed, which becomes
a shadow rate Taylor rule. The Phillips curve stays the same. During normal times, this
model is the same as the standard New Keynesian model. However, monetary policy remains
active in our model when the ZLB prevails, which is not the case in the standard model.
We investigate new empirical evidence to establish the relevance of the shadow rate and
validate our new model. First, at the ZLB, the shadow rate comoves almost perfectly with
an overall financial conditions index and various private interest rates. They are the relevant
indicators that drive agents’ behavior and are the channel through which unconventional
monetary policy propagates into the overall economy. Second, the shadow rate is highly
correlated with the Fed’s balance sheet, widely accepted as one summary for unconventional
monetary policy, with the correlation being -0.94 throughout the QE phase. Third, the
shadow rate follows the same Taylor rule as the fed funds rate did prior to the ZLB.
The standard NK model is associated with some distinctive modeling implications at
the ZLB, some of which are counterfactual or puzzling. First, in such a model, a negative
supply shock stimulates the economy at the ZLB. In contrast to this model implication,
empirical evidence from Wieland (2015) and Garı́n et al. (2016) demonstrate the sign of
output response is the same as the sign of the shock during normal times and at the ZLB. This
conterfactual implication of the standard model is due to the lack of policy interventions at

3

the ZLB. Our model restores the data-consistent implication by introducing unconventional
monetary policy through the shadow rate. A related issue is the size of the governmentspending multiplier. In a standard model without unconventional monetary policy, this
multiplier is much larger at the ZLB. This larger multiplier also disappears in our model.
We then formalize the SRNKM with agents’ optimization problems: at the ZLB, a negative shadow interest rate is not the actual borrowing or lending rate firms and households
face, nor does the Fed set the shadow rate directly. But rather, the Fed monitors and targets
the shadow rate, which is determined by the shadow rate Taylor rule, and achieves the target
through some major unconventional policy.
The first example implements the negative shadow rate through QE programs. The
central bank purchases bonds to lower their yields without changing the policy rate, which
works by reducing the risk premium, motivated by the empirical research; see, for example,
Hamilton and Wu (2012) and Gagnon et al. (2011). We demonstrate the QE purchases can be
summarized equivalently by the shadow rate in our model, providing one microfoundation for
the shadow rate IS curve. To achieve this equivalence, the model requires a linear relationship
between log bond holdings by the Fed and the shadow rate. We verify this relationship in
the data, with the correlation between these two variables being -0.92.
Second, we map lending facilities, which inject liquidity into the economy, into the shadow
rate framework. The primary example of this policy is the Federal Reserve’s Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility. We model lending facilities by allowing the government
to extend extra credit directly to the private sector; that is, the government can vary the
loan-to-value ratio the borrowers face as a policy tool. The lending facilities are coupled
with a tax policy on interest rate payments, which, according to Waller (2016) of the St.
Louis Fed, is the nature of the recent negative interest rate policy in Europe and Japan. We
then establish an equivalence between the shadow rate and the lending facilities – tax policy
channel, which constitutes another microfoundation for the shadow rate IS curve.
Although much of the models are presented in the linearized form, the usefulness of the

4

shadow rate goes beyond linearity. We demonstrate this point with the lending facilities – tax
policy channel, where the equivalence is also established without linearization. Whether or
not the model is linearized, the common theme is that the shadow rate serves as a summary
statistic for various unconventional policy tools and does not introduce a structural break
at the ZLB.
The shadow rate also salvages the NK model from issues arising from the structural break
introduced by the ZLB, which imposes one of the biggest challenges for solving and estimating these models. Methods proposed in the literature to address this issue either produce
economically uncompelling implications or are extremely computationally demanding. This
challenge does not go away after the economy lifts off from the ZLB because research relies
on historical data. Our SRNKM proposes a compelling solution to this challenge. It does
not incur a structural break at the ZLB whether we work with a linear or non-linear model.
Therefore, it restores the traditional solution and estimation methods’ validity.
The rest of the paper after a brief literature review proceeds as follows. Section 2 proposes
a three-equation linear SRNKM. Subsequently, Sections 3 and 4 map QE and lending facilities into this model theoretically. Section 5 discusses quantitative analyses, and Section 6
concludes.

Related literature: Our paper contributes to the DSGE literature on unconventional
monetary policy. Cúrdia and Woodford (2011), Chen et al. (2012), and Gertler and Karadi
(2013) study asset purchases, that is, QE. Gertler and Karadi (2011), Williamson (2012),
and Del Negro et al. (2016) evaluate central banks’ liquidity provision, along the lines of
lending facilities. McKay et al. (2014), Del Negro et al. (2015), and Kulish et al. (2016)
focus on forward guidance. We model QE and lending facilities directly. Our paper also
speaks to forward guidance in the sense that the shadow rate reflects changes in medium- or
long-term yields due to forward guidance. A direct mapping between the two is in Wu and
Xia (2016).

5

Our paper differs from the existing literature in the follow respects. First, we use the
shadow rate to provide one coherent framework for the ZLB period as well as for normal
times, whereas models in the literature are specifically targeted for the ZLB. Consequently,
our framework provides a natural extension to models researchers developed prior to the ZLB,
because the shadow rate is the same as the fed funds rate when the ZLB is not binding.
Second, rather than focus on a specific policy tool, we use the shadow rate as a summary
for all unconventional monetary policy measures. Third, the shadow rate is not subject to a
structural break at the ZLB, which makes the model tractable and alleviates numerical and
computational issues.

2

A shadow rate New Keynesian model (SRNKM)

In this and the next two sections, we propose a novel SRNKM, which captures both the
conventional interest rate rule and unconventional policy tools in a coherent and tractable
way. This section presents the three-equation linear version of the model, and Sections 3 4 then microfound this model with two major unconventional policy tools: QE and lending
facilities. Subsection 2.1 sets up the standard New Keynesian model and demonstrates
its lack of unconventional monetary policy. Subsection 2.2 introduces a linear SRNKM
to address the issue with the standard model. Subsections 2.3 - 2.4 illustrate the shadow
rate’s empirical relevance. We then discuss our model’s economic implications in 2.5, and
computational advantages in 2.6.

6

2.1

Standard NK model and its lack of unconventional monetary
policy

The standard linear NK model (e.g., see Galı́ (2008)) consists of
1
yt = − (rt − Et πt+1 − r) + Et yt+1 ,
σ

(2.1)

πt = βEt πt+1 + κ(yt − ytn ),

(2.2)

st = φs st−1 + (1 − φs ) [φy (yt − ytn ) + φπ πt + s] ,

(2.3)

rt = max(0, st ),

(2.4)

where E is the expectation operator, lowercase letters are logs, letters without t subscripts
are either coefficients or steady-state values, and all the coefficients are positive. yt is output,
and ytn is potential output or equilibrium output under flexible prices. πt is inflation, and rt is
the policy rate. Equation (2.1) is the NK IS curve describing demand as a decreasing function
of the real interest rate rt − Et πt+1 , where σ is the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution. Equation (2.2) is the NK Phillips curve, characterizing the aggregate supply,
where β is the discount factor, and κ depends on the degree of nominal rigidity and other
preference parameters. The shadow fed funds rate st follows a Taylor (1993) rule in (2.3).
The policy rate equals the shadow rate during normal times, and it is 0 when the shadow
rate is negative.
In this framework, unconventional monetary policy plays no role at the ZLB. Once the
ZLB hits, st < 0, the policy rate rt = 0, and monetary policy is completely inactive in the
system; see (2.1).
Unconventional policy tools, such as QE, target interest rates at longer maturities, and
potentially with default and liquidity risks. This link has been confirmed by empirical
research; for example, see Hamilton and Wu (2012), Bauer and Rudebusch (2014), and
Swanson (2017). To fix ideas, it is useful to iterate the IS curve (2.1) forward to see an
example of how other interest rates can affect agents’ behavior when the policy rate is at its
7

ZLB:

yt = −

n
1X
Et (rt+i−1 − πt+i − r) + Et yt+n
σ i=1

n
1
1X
= − nrt,t+n −
Et (−πt+i − r) + Et yt+n .
σ
σ i=1

(2.5)

Under the expectations hypothesis, rt,t+n is the long term interest rate from t to t + n. In
this framework, agents make decisions based on the long-term real interest rate. Even if
the short-term interest rate is constrained, the central bank can still stimulate the economy
by moving the long-term interest rate. However, this is not the case in the standard NK
model: the central bank cannot act now or in the near future, because of the ZLB constraint.
Moreover, in the future when the ZLB is no longer an issue, agents do not expect the central
bank to react in retrospect to a shock that happened at time t, because the Taylor rule (2.3)
prescribes the central bank to respond only to concurrent shocks.

2.2

Linear SRNKM

In this section, we propose a novel NK model with the shadow fed funds rate to address the
standard NK model’s lack of unconventional monetary policy. The shadow rate extends the
fed funds rate’s role as the stance of monetary policy to the ZLB. When the ZLB constrains
the risk-free rate rt , unconventional monetary policy targets other interest rates, for example,
rt,t+n in (2.5)’s terminology. The shadow rate can captures this policy intervention, because
it is extracted from the entire yield curve.
The three-equation linear SRNKM is defined as follows:
Definition 1 The shadow rate New Keynesian model consists of the shadow rate IS curve
1
yt = − (st − Et πt+1 − s) + Et yt+1 ,
σ
New Keynesian Phillips curve (2.2), and the shadow rate Taylor rule (2.3).
8

(2.6)

The benefit of using the shadow rate rather than introducing an additional monetary
instrument just for the ZLB, such as a second interest rate or volume of money or assets,
is that our model extends the standard NK model to incorporate unconventional monetary
policy without introducing a structural break. During normal times when st > 0, the model
is the same as the standard model. The difference is that monetary policy is still active at
the ZLB, capturing central banks’ efforts through unconventional policy tools.
To further support the model, in Subsection 2.3, we document evidence that the shadow
rate resembles the dynamics of overall financial conditions, various private interest rates, and
the Fed’s balance sheet. We formalize this link between the shadow rate and unconventional
monetary policy theoretically in Sections 3 - 4 by microfounding (2.6) with two examples of
unconventional policy tools. Note in our microfounded models, a negative shadow interest
rate is not the actual borrowing or lending rate firms and households face. Rather, we
propose to use it as a summary statistic for all the measures of the Fed’s conventional and
unconventional policies.

2.3

Shadow rate: a summary for unconventional monetary policy

The new IS curve in (2.6) uses the shadow rate to summarize the effect of unconventional
monetary policy on the economy. This section assesses the empirical validity of this assumption. Economic agents care about interest rates they face when they borrow or lend,
or more broadly, the overall financial conditions, through which unconventional monetary
policy transmits into the real economy. We investigate the comovement between the shadow
rate and some key indicators. In Figure 1, the black line is Wu and Xia’s (2016) shadow rate,
and the red dashed line is the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index (GSFCI) for the
United States, which tracks broad financial markets including equity prices, the US dollar,
Treasury yields, and credit spreads. The GSFCI and shadow rate have similar U-shaped
dynamics, and their correlation is 0.8.
Moreover, various interest rates that private agents face also comove with the shadow

the BBB effective yield, and the green dotted line is the AAA effective yield. None of these
corporate borrowing rates, whether investment grade or high yield, face the ZLB: they are at
least 1.5% and display meaningful variation. They also track the U-shaped dynamics of the
shadow rate, and their correlations with the shadow rate are 0.8, 0.8, and 0.6, respectively.
Swanson and Williams (2014) and Gertler and Karadi (2015) recommend using the 2year Treasury yield as a proxy for monetary policy during the ZLB period. The shadow
rate and the 2-year yield have a correlation of 0.6 at the ZLB, capturing similar information.
The shadow rate has some advantages over the 2-year yield. First, after the QE2 was
implemented, the 2-year yield was essentially zero for about two years, consequently, its
correlations with private rates and GSFCI are lower than our shadow rate in general. Another

advantage the shadow rate has over the 2-year rate is that the shadow rate moves in the
same scale as these private rates, whereas the 2-year yield is moving in a smaller scale.
Next, we compare the shadow rate with unconventional monetary policy directly, for
which a popular measure is the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet; see Figure 2. The Fed’s
assets (in red) grow from about $2 trillion in 2009 to about $4.5 trillion by the end of
2014. The net expansion over this period reflects primarily QE. Meanwhile, the shadow rate
drops from 0.6% to -3%. These two series are highly correlated with a correlation of -0.94
throughout the QE phase. The subsequent rise of the shadow rate is driven primarily by
forward guidance, which is not reflected in the Fed’s balance sheet.
Overall, the resemblance between the shadow rate and the Fed’s balance sheet validates
its role as a summary for unconventional monetary policy. Its high correlations with the
GSFCI and various interest rates support that the shadow rate IS curve in (2.6) describes
how the private economy factors in the additional stimulus from unconventional policy tools.

11

2.4

Shadow rate Taylor rule

We have established the shadow rate as a tractable summary for unconventional monetary
policy. Next, we assess whether the Taylor rule is a good description of the shadow rate
dynamics by estimating (2.3) empirically via regressing the shadow rate on the output gap
and inflation. For the shadow rate, we take Wu and Xia’s (2016) spliced series of the fed
funds rate during normal times and shadow rate at the ZLB. The output gap is the difference
between the log of GDP and the log of potential GDP, measured in 2009 chained dollars.
Inflation is the log difference of the GDP Deflator, and the data are quarterly.
We run two regressions with different sample periods popular in the literature: the first
regression uses the full sample from 1954Q1 to 2017Q1, and its results are in the top row
of Figure 3. The second regression uses a subsample from 1985Q1 to 2017Q1, shown in the
bottom row of Figure 3. The coefficient on inflation is 1.2 for the full sample and 1.4 for the
subsample, consistent with the Taylor (1993) principle.
In the left column of Figure 3, we plot together the implemented monetary policy in blue
and what the Taylor rule prescribes in red. The Taylor rule seems to be a good description of
what actually happens, including the ZLB period. We also plot the regression residual, which
can be interpreted as the monetary policy shock, in the right column. Most prominently,
in the top right panel, the size of the monetary policy shock was much larger during the
1980s when interest rates were high. On the contrary, the shock during the ZLB period had
a similar size to the rest of the sample, regardless of which sample we use for the regression.
To see more formally whether a structural break exists, we test jointly whether the
slope coefficients in the estimated Taylor rule have significantly changed at the ZLB: the F
statistics for the full sample (post-85 sample) is 0.48 (1.42), which is smaller than the 5%
critical value, 2.64 (2.68). Therefore, we fail to reject the null of no structural break. This
result is consistent with Wu and Xia’s (2016) findings.

2.5

Economic implications

The standard NK model is associated with some counterfactual or puzzling modeling implications at the ZLB, because it does not allow any role for unconventional monetary policy.
We focus on two such implications that are often discussed in the literature. First, a negative
supply shock stimulates the economy, which is considered to be counterfactual.2 Second, the
government-spending multiplier is much larger than usual, and this finding is still under
2

Christiano et al. (2015) point out this implication depends on whether the shock is temporary or permanent. We refer to models in the literature with a transitory shock as the “standard” model.

13

debate. We demonstrate qualitative implications in this section, and leave the discussion of
quantitative implications to Section 5.
Both a transitory negative shock on productivity and a positive government-spending
shock cause higher inflation. During normal times, in response to higher inflation, the
interest rate increases more than one-for-one, implying a higher real interest rate, which in
turn suppresses demand. This mechanism implies lower output in response to the negative
supply shock, and a government multiplier less than 1.
The standard NK model suggests the opposite implications for both scenarios at the ZLB
due to the lack of policy interventions. A constant policy rate in the standard NK model
implies a lower real interest rate instead, which then stimulates private consumption, investment, and hence the overall economy. Therefore, the standard model implies a stimulative
negative supply shock and larger government-spending multiplier.
In contrast to the implication of the standard NK model, empirical evidence from Wieland
(2015) and Garı́n et al. (2016) demonstrate a similar response of output to a supply shock
during normal times and at the ZLB. Our model with the shadow rate capturing unconventional monetary policy is able to generate this data-consistent implication. The shadow
rate reacts positively to higher inflation through unconventional monetary policy, which is
similar to how the conventional monetary policy works during normal times. Such a reaction
increases the real rate private agents face, and implies a lower output in the model, which
is consistent with the data. Moreover, the same model suggests the fiscal multiplier is the
same as usual, contributing to the ongoing debate. This model implication is consistent with
Braun et al. (2012), Mertens and Ravn (2014), Swanson and Williams (2014), and Wieland
(2015).

2.6

Computational advantages

Besides the benefit of sensible economic implications, the SRNKM also salvages the NK
model from the structural break introduced by the occasionally binding ZLB on the policy
14

rate, which imposes one of the biggest challenges for solving and estimating these models.
One strand of research linearizes the equilibrium conditions without considering the ZLB,
and then assumes the ZLB is driven by some exogenous shocks. This assumption greatly simplifies the solution, but it has several undesirable implications; for example, see FernándezVillaverde et al. (2015) and Aruoba et al. (2016). Another strand of literature uses global
projection methods to approximate agents’ decision rules, such as Gust et al. (forthcoming),
Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2015), and Aruoba et al. (2016). The non-linearity dramatically
increases computing time and demands for more computing power.
This challenge does not go away after the economy lifts off from the ZLB. Instead, it
becomes even more problematic as time goes on, because when the ZLB period is no longer
at the end of the sample, researchers can not simply discard it. The central tension is how
we treat the seven-year period of the ZLB.
Our shadow rate model proposes a compelling solution to this challenge. Our model does
not incur a structural break at the ZLB as the standard model does; therefore, it restores
traditional solution and estimation methods’ validity.

Mapping QE into SRNKM

We have shown the relationship between the shadow rate and unconventional monetary
policy empirically in Subsection 2.3. Next, we formalize this link. We microfound the
SRNKM introduced in Section 2 using two major programs: QE in this section and lending
facilities in Section 4.

3.1

Model of QE

The first policy tool is large-scale asset purchases (QE). QE programs target interest rates
at longer maturities and/or with default and liquidity risks. When the ZLB binds for the fed
funds rate, these interest rates are not constrained. We simply refer to the wedge between

15

such an interest rate and the fed funds rate as the risk premium without taking a stance
on whether it is a term premium or corporate spread. The central bank purchases these
bonds to lower their interest rates by reducing the risk premium, which is motivated by the
empirical literature; see, for example, Gagnon et al. (2011) and Hamilton and Wu (2012). To
keep the model simple, we set it up with government bonds in this section to demonstrate
the equivalence between QE and the shadow rate. The same equivalence holds when bonds
are issued by firms as well; see Appendix A.1.

where the policy rate rt follows the Taylor rule during normal times as in (2.3) and (2.4).
We refer to the wedge between the two rates rpt as the risk premium. Krishnamurthy and
Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and Del Negro et al. (2017) label a similar term as the convenience
yield. Empirical research, for example, Gagnon et al. (2011), Krishnamurthy and VissingJorgensen (2011), and Hamilton and Wu (2012), finds a larger amount of bonds the central
bank holds through QE operations are associated with a lower risk premium, which suggests

rpt is a decreasing function of the total purchase of bonds by the central bank bCB
t :

rp0t (bCB
t ) < 0.

(3.6)

This negative relationship, without additional assumptions about functional forms, then
suggests the following in the linear model:

CB
rpt (bCB
− bCB ),
t ) = rp − ς(bt

(3.7)

where ς > 0.
During normal times, bCB
= bCB , and rpt (bCB ) = rp. The assumption of a constant risk
t
premium can be relaxed to allow some stochastic shocks, and this extension does not change
our results. An implementation with the shock specified similar to Smets and Wouters (2007)
3

The international economics literature also establishes a similar relationship between bond quantity
and risk premium; see Uribe and Yue (2006) and Nason and Rogers (2006), for example, with the former
motivating it by some cost associated with financial intermediaries who facilitate bond tractions. The risk
premium is a well-established empirical fact in the term structure literature; see Wright (2011), Bauer et al.
(2012), Bauer et al. (2014), and Creal and Wu (forthcoming).

bank implements QE to increase its bond holdings bCB
in order to provide further stimulus.

The total supply of bonds is held by households and the central bank: Bt = BtH + BtCB ,
where Bt can be time-varying and subject to exogenous shocks.
The linearized QE model consists of the new IS curve (3.4) and the risk premium channel
of bond purchase (3.5) and (3.7), and together with the usual Phillips curve (2.2) and policy
rule (2.3) and (2.4).

then

policy rate rt with a time-varying wedge, the difference between the return on the bond in
(3.10) and st is a constant. This leads to the following proposition.

curve (2.6), New Keynesian Phillips curve (2.2), and shadow rate Taylor rule (2.3) is equivalent to a model where monetary policy is implemented by the conventional Taylor rule during

Proof: See Appendix B.
Proposition 1 establishes QE as one microfoundation for (2.6). Note that at the ZLB, a
negative shadow interest rate is not the actual borrowing or lending rate firms and households
face. The Fed monitors and targets the shadow rate, which is determined by the shadow rate
Taylor rule. The Fed does not set the shadow rate directly, but rather, it achieves the target
through purchasing and selling bonds according to Proposition 1. An analogy during normal
times is that the Fed reaches the federal funds rate target through open market operations.
An extension from government bonds to corporate bonds is in Appendix A.1. The equivalence holds regardless of who issues bonds, as long as the relationships between the risk
premium, bond holdings, and the shadow rate in Proposition 1 hold.

3.3

Quantifying the assumption in Proposition 1

Proposition 1 assumes a linear relationship between bCB
and st with a negative correlation
t
at the ZLB in (3.9). Figure 4 verifies this relationship in the data, where the shadow rate
is in black and the negative of the log of the Fed’s asset holdings through QE purchases is
in red, including Treasury securities, Federal agency debt securities, and mortgage-backed
securities. They comove with a high correlation of 0.92 from QE1 to QE3.
The data also inform us about the coefficient ς and the effects of QE programs on the
shadow rate. We regress the shadow rate st on log asset holdings of the Fed bCB
t , and the
slope coefficient is −1.83, which means when the Fed increases its bond holdings by 1%, the

shadow rate decreases by 0.0183%. QE1 increases the Fed’s holdings on Treasuries, Federal
agency debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities from 490 billion to 2 trillion, mapping
into about a 2.5% decrease in the shadow rate. This number is larger than the actual change
in the shadow rate, and the difference can be explained by unwinding lending facilities. QE3
is another larger operation, changing the Fed’s asset holdings from 2.6 trillion to 4.2 trillion.
Although QE3 is as big an operation as QE1 in the dollar amount, the percentage change of
QE3 is much smaller. Our model implies a 0.9% decrease in the shadow rate. The difference
between this number and the actual change can be explained by the expansionary forward
guidance at the time.

Mapping lending facilities into SRNKM

In this section, we map lending facilities into the SRNKM introduced in Section 2. These
facilities inject liquidity into the economy by extending loans to the private sector. One

20

prominent example is the Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility,
which has been assessed by, for example, Ashcraft et al. (2010) and Del Negro et al. (2016).
Similar policies implemented by other central banks include the Eurosystem’s valuation
haircuts and UK’s credit controls.

4.1

Model of lending facilities

We extend the standard model characterized by (2.1) - (2.4) in the following respects. First,
we replace the standard wholesale firms with entrepreneurs, who produce intermediate goods
using capital and labor and then sell them in a competitive market to the retailers. Entrepreneurs maximize their lifetime utility. They have a lower discount factor and are less
patient than households. As a result, they borrow from households using capital as collateral
up to a constant loan-to-value ratio allowed by the households. Second, we allow the government to have two additional policy tools at the ZLB. It can loosen entrepreneurs’ borrowing
constraint by directly lending to them through lending facilities, effectively making the loanto-value ratio higher and time varying. Another policy the government employs at the ZLB
is a tax on the interest rate income of households and a subsidy to entrepreneurs. Taxing
interest rate income can be motivated by the recent phenomenon of negative interest rates
in Europe and Japan, according to Waller (2016) of the St. Louis Fed. The pre-tax/subsidy
private interest rate imposes a constant markup over the policy rate RtB = Rt RP , which is
a simplified version of the setup in Section 3.
Entrepreneurs (denoted by a superscript E) produce intermediate goods YtE according
to a Cobb-Douglas function,
α
YtE = AKt−1
(Lt )1−α ,

(4.1)

where A is technology, Kt−1 is physical capital used at period t and determined at t − 1,
and α is capital share of production. Capital accumulates following the law of motion:
Kt = It + (1 − δ)Kt−1 , where δ is the depreciation rate and It is investment. Entrepreneurs

21

sell intermediate goods to retailers at the price PtE , and retailers then mark up the price by
Xt ≡ Pt /PtE .
Entrepreneurs choose consumption CtE , investment on capital stock It , and labor input
Lt to maximize their utility

During normal times, B̃t = B̃tH and Mt = M . At the ZLB, the central bank can provide extra
credit B̃tCB to firms through lending facilities allowing Mt > M . The total credit firms obtain
equals households’ bond holdings plus the central bank’s bond holdings B̃t = B̃tH + B̃tCB .
The monopolistically competitive final goods producers, who face Calvo-stickiness, behave the same as in the benchmark model. The government still implements the Taylor rule
during normal times. The goods market clears if

Yt = Ct + CtE + It .

4.2

(4.11)

Shadow rate equivalence for lending facilities

To boost the economy, the central bank can implement either conventional or unconventional
monetary policy. During normal times, it lowers Rt . At the ZLB, it implements unconventional policy tools by increasing Mt and increasing tax/transfer Tt . Unconventional policy
tools stimulate the economy through the following channels. First, a higher loan-to-value
ratio allows entrepreneurs to secure more loans. Second, the tax benefit for entrepreneurs’
interest rate payment effectively lowers their borrowing cost, encouraging them to borrow,
consume, invest, and produce more. All together, these channels boost the aggregate demand, and help the economy eventually escape the “liquidity trap”.
Not only do conventional and unconventional monetary policies work through similar
channels, but they are also observationally equivalent in our model, because they always
appear in pairs in equilibrium conditions. In households’ consumption Euler equation (4.8)
23

and households’ and entrepreneurs’ budget constraints (4.7) and (4.4), government policy
appears in the form Rt /Tt . In the entrepreneurs’ borrowing constraint (4.3) and first-order
condition (4.6), it appears in the form Rt /Mt . Hence, lowering Rt or increasing Mt and Tt
can reduce Rt /Tt and Rt /Mt . Moreover, Mt /Tt enters entrepreneurs’ Euler equation (4.6),
and moving both proportionally keeps this ratio constant.
The following proposition formalizes the equivalence between conventional and unconventional policies, both of which can be captured by the shadow rate.
Proposition 2 If



Rt = St , Tt = 1, Mt = M

for St ≥ 1



Rt = 1, Tt = Mt /M = 1/St

for St < 1,

then the shadow rate St is the sufficient statistic for all conventional and unconventional
policies.
Proof: See Appendix B.
Note the equivalence in Proposition 2 is achieved without linearization, which extends the
usefulness of the shadow rate beyond linearized models. Whether the model is linearized
or not, the shadow rate is a summary for all policy instruments and does not introduce a
structural break at the ZLB.
The equivalence can also be extended to the linear model, which describes the equilibrium

microfoundation for (2.6), because (4.20) is (2.6) without imposing the market-clearing condition.

Quantitative analyses

The mechanism for how the SRNKM works has been demonstrated qualitatively in Section 2.
In this section, we study the quantitative implications of this model. We first explain the
26

quantitative model and solution method. Next, we discuss the consequence of an inflation
shock at the ZLB and relate it to the supply shock and government-spending shock discussed
in Subsection 2.5.

5.1

Model and methodology

Shadow rate vs. standard model We analyze contrasts between our shadow rate model
and the standard model. We term any model that does not have unconventional monetary
policy the standard model. Although the standard model we introduce in this section has
many more ingredients than the standard three-equation NK model, they share similar
qualitative implications that are discussed in Subsection 2.5. In a standard model, rt = 0
enters the Euler equation, budget constraint, borrowing constraint, and so on at the ZLB.
By contrast, the shadow model has unconventional monetary policy. It replaces rt with the
negative shadow rate st at the ZLB.
Extended model Many components are from Iacoviello’s (2005) full model, including
five sectors, of which two are households. Both types of households work, consume, and
hold housing stocks. They differ in their discount factors. Patient households have a higher
discount factor and save. Impatient households have a lower discount factor and borrow
from patient households using their existing housing as collateral. Entrepreneurs also have a
lower discount factor than patient households, and hence borrow from them with collateral as
well. Entrepreneurs consume, invest, and hold houses. They use housing, capital, and labor
as inputs to produce identical intermediate goods and sell them in a competitive market to
retailers. Retailers are monopolistically competitive. They differentiate intermediate goods
into final goods, and set prices with Calvo-type stickiness. The central bank implements a
Taylor rule.
We have shown in Sections 3 and 4 how the negative shadow rate can be implemented
through various unconventional policy tools. These unconventional tools set our model

27

apart from Iacoviello’s (2005). First, we use a time-varying risk premium to capture QE
discussed in Section 3. Second, we allow the loan-to-value ratio to be time-varying to model
lending facilities. Additionally, lenders’ (borrowers’) bond returns (payments) are subject to
a time-varying tax (subsidy) at the ZLB. These two policies together constitute the channel
discussed in Section 4. We also differ from his model by allowing the government to adjust the
aggregate demand through changing its expenditure, so that we can study the governmentspending multiplier. The detailed model setup is in Appendix C.1. Many parameter values
are taken from Iacoviello (2005) and Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2015), and more calibration
details are in Appendix C.2,

Solution method For our shadow rate model capturing unconventional monetary policy,
we work with a linear model where only the shadow rate enters the model representing
all possible channels for monetary policy. In this case, the constraint of the ZLB for the
policy rate does not impose any non-linearity in our model. Full details of the linear model
are in Appendix C.4.1. After we solve the model, we use the results from Propositions
1 - 3 to demonstrate how the negative shadow rate can be implemented with underlying
unconventional policy tools discussed in Sections 3 and 4. The details are in Appendix
C.4.2 - Appendix C.4.3. As a comparison, we also analyze the standard model with the
ZLB constraint (see details in Appendix C.4.4) with the method of Guerrieri and Iacoviello
(2015).

ZLB environment To create a ZLB environment, we follow Christiano et al. (2011),
Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2015), and many other to impose a series of positive preference
shocks on the economy.4 The shocks last from period 1 to 15. The total shock size is 4%
implying a size of 4/15% per period. They cause people to save more, push the nominal
policy rate rt to zero at period 8, and keep it there until about period 20. The impulse
4

Schorfheide et al. (2014) and Creal and Wu (2016) introduce preference shocks to study risk premium.

28

responses to this sequence of shocks are in Appendix D.5

5.2

Negative inflation shock at the ZLB

One of the major concerns about the ZLB is deflation. Once the economy encounters a
deflationary spiral, the problem will exacerbate: a decrease in price leads to lower production,
which in turn contributes to a lower wage and demand. Lower demand further decreases the
price. In this section, we investigate the effect of unconventional monetary policy in fighting
deflation at the ZLB through the lens of our SRNKM.
In addition to the positive preference shocks to create the ZLB environment, we introduce
a negative inflation shock of the size 0.2% at period 10. To investigate its marginal impact
on the economy, we plot in Figure 5 the difference between the total effects of both shocks
and the effects of only preference shocks. The red lines capture the standard model without
unconventional monetary policy, while the blue lines represent the shadow rate model when
unconventional monetary policy is present.
Inflation and hence inflation expectation decrease less in the shadow rate model (in
blue) compared to the standard model (in red); that is, the responsiveness of unconventional
monetary policy alleviates some of the deflationary concern. The policy rate does not respond
in either case when the ZLB is binding. However, the access to unconventional monetary
policy allows the shadow rate to further drop by 0.4% at the maximum. The post-tax
nominal return on bonds rtB − τt (in plot 3) defined in Section 3 or 4 moves one-for-one with
the shadow rate.
A lower shadow rate can be implemented either through a QE channel in Section 3 (blue
line in plot 6) or a lending facility – fiscal policy in Section 4 (blue lines in plots 7 and 8).
For example, the 0.4% drop in the shadow rate can be obtained by the same amount of
change in the risk premium through bond purchases. The amount of purchases, however, is
state-dependent, and it amounts to 130, 530, 660, or 1080 billion dollars if the pre-purchase
5

Our results in Sections 5.2 - 5.4 are robust to alternative shocks to create the ZLB environment, for
example, inflation shocks.

Notes: We hit the economy with two types of shocks. First, a series of positive preference shocks occurs
in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size is 4%. Second, a negative inflation shock happens in period 10
with a size of 0.2%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks, and only plot the additional effect of
the inflation shock. The red lines represent the case in which, when the policy rate is bounded by zero, no
unconventional monetary policy is implemented. The blue lines represent the case in which unconventional
monetary policy is implemented through a negative shadow rate. Plots 1-7 are in percentage, among which
plots 1-6 are annualized. Plots 8-12 are measured in percentage deviation from the steady state. The
shadow rate in plot 1 is an overall measure of monetary policy. In normal times, it is implemented through
the policy rate in plot 2. At the ZLB, it can be implemented through QE in plot 6 (per Section 3) or the

Translating these numbers into the annual rate, 0.1% × 4 = 0.4%, can explain the same
amount of change in the shadow rate.
With unconventional monetary policy, a lower nominal rate and higher inflation expectation imply a less and more transitory increase in the real rate rrt ≡ rtB − τt − Et πt+1 , which
30

incentivise firms to invest and households to consume more. For example, output increases
by 0.6% in the shadow rate model, whereas it decreases by 0.2% in the standard model.
The differences in responses to the inflation shock provide the basic mechanism to explain
the economic implications discussed in Subsection 2.5, which we will turn to next.

5.3

Negative supply shock at the ZLB

In this section, we quantify the effects of a negative supply shock discussed in Subsection 2.5.
We add a -1% TFP innovation at period 10 and plot in Figure 6 its marginal contributions.
The standard model shows a negative supply shock increases output at the ZLB (red
line in plot 9), which contradicts the empirical findings; for example, see Wieland (2015)
and Garı́n et al. (2016). By contrast, our shadow rate model (blue line) produces a negative
impact of such a shock. This result is data-consistent. The same contrast can be further
extended to other real variables: consumption and investment. More specifically, with the
presence of unconventional monetary policy, output decreases by 0.4%, consumption by 0.6%,
and investment by 0.2%.
The differences in impulse responses reflect whether monetary policy is active. This
works through the same mechanism as explained in Subsection 5.2. The differences are the
directions and magnitudes. In the case with active unconventional monetary policy, the
shadow rate increases by 0.8%, which can be implemented by selling 180, 750, 940, or 1530
billion dollars of bonds if the pre-sale holdings were at the pre-QE1, pre-QE2, pre-QE3, or
post-QE3 level, respectively. Alternatively, the government can decrease the loan-to-value
ratio and tax rate by 0.2%.

5.4

Government-spending multiplier at the ZLB

This section quantifies the government-spending multiplier discussed in Subsection 2.5. We
introduce a sequence of government spending shocks from period 8 to 15 with a total (perperiod) size of 5% (0.625%), and plot their impact in Figure 7.

Notes: We hit the economy with two types of shocks. First, a series of positive preference shocks occurs in
periods 1-15, and the total shock size is 4%. Second, a negative TFP shock happens in period 10 with a
size of 1%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks and only plot the additional effect of the TFP
shock. The red lines represent the case in which, when the policy rate is bounded by zero, no unconventional
monetary policy is implemented. The blue lines represent the case in which unconventional monetary policy
is implemented through a negative shadow rate. Plots 1-7 are in percentage, among which plots 1-6 are
annualized. Plots 8-12 are measured in percentage deviation from the steady state. The shadow rate in plot
1 is an overall measure of monetary policy. In normal times, it is implemented through the policy rate in
plot 2. At the ZLB, it can be implemented through QE in plot 6 (per Section 3) or the lending facilities
(LF) in plots 7 and 8 (per Section 4). The shaded area marks periods 8-18.

The government-spending multiplier in the standard model (red line in plot 12) is mostly
above 1 and peaks at 3.2 when the policy rate is bounded at zero and the central bank takes
no additional measures to smooth the economy. By contrast, the number is less than 0.7 in
the shadow rate model (in blue) when the central bank monitors and adjusts the shadow
rate through implementing unconventional monetary policy.
Positive government shocks push up the aggregate demand, which leads to a rising pres32

Notes: We hit the economy with two types of shocks. First, a series of positive preference shocks occurs
in periods 1 - 15, and the total shock size is 4%. Second, government-spending shocks occur from periods
8-15 with a total size of 5%. We difference out the effect of preference shocks, and only plot the additional

sure on inflation. This again lands itself as another application of the mechanism explained
in Subsection 5.2. Higher inflation without policy intervention boosts the private economy,
yielding a multiplier greater than 1.
By contrast, in our shadow rate model, the shadow rate increases by 0.4% in response to
such a shock, crowding out private consumption by 0.2% and investment by 0.1%. Although

33

output still increases by 0.4%, its change is less than the shocks themselves, producing
a smaller multiplier. The change in the shadow rate in our model can be implemented
through increasing the risk premium by 0.4%, which requires to sell 100, 390, 490, or 800
billion dollars of bonds if the pre-sale holdings were at the pre-QE1, pre-QE2, pre-QE3, or
post-QE3 level, respectively. An alternative policy is to reduce the loan-to-value ratio and
tax rate by 0.1%.

Conclusion

We have built a New Keynesian model with the shadow rate, which coherently captures
the conventional interest rate rule in normal times, and unconventional monetary policy at
the ZLB. The model is the same as the standard New Keynesian model when the policy
rate is above zero. When the policy rate is binding at zero, however, unlike the standard
model with an inactive monetary policy, the central bank in our model continues to monitor
and adjust the shadow rate following the shadow rate Taylor rule. A negative shadow rate
prescribed by this Taylor rule can be implemented, for example, by QE and/or lending
facilities. Our model restores the data-consistent result that a negative supply shock is
always contractionary. Relatedly, the unusually large government-spending multiplier in the
standard New Keynesian model at the ZLB also disappears. In addition to incorporating
unconventional policy tools in a sensible and tractable way, our model does not incur a
structural break at the ZLB whether we work with a linear or non-linear model. Hence, it
restores existing solution and estimation methods’ validity.

Corollary 2 The shadow rate New Keynesian model represented by the shadow rate IS curve (A.20), New
Keynesian Phillips curve (2.2), and shadow rate Taylor rule (2.3) is equivalent to a model where monetary
policy is implemented by the conventional Taylor rule during normal times and QE at the ZLB that changes

Proof of Propositions

Proof for Proposition 1 To prove the equivalence, the key is to show the QE IS curve in (3.4) is
the same as the shadow rate IS curve (2.6).
During normal times bCB
= bCB , rtB = rt + rp, rt = st , the QE Euler equation (3.4) becomes

rt + rp − Et πt+1 − rB + Et yt+1

yt = −

(B.2)

Therefore, in both cases, we have shown (3.4) and (2.6) are equivalent. 

Proof for Proposition 2 During normal times, Rt = St , Tt = 1, and Mt = M imply
Rt /Tt = St , Rt /Mt = St /M, Mt /Tt = M.
At the ZLB, Tt = Mt /M = 1/St , and Rt = 1 imply
Rt /Tt = St , Rt /Mt = St /M, Mt /Tt = M.
Therefore, government policies, whether conventional or conventional, can be summarized by the single
variable St . 

Proof for Proposition 3 rt − τt enters (4.12) and (4.13), and Proposition 2 have shown rt − τt =
log(Rt /Tt ) = st . rt − mt enters (4.14) and (4.15), and Proposition 2 have shown rt − mt = log(Rt /Mt ) =
st − m. τt − mt enters (4.15), and Proposition 2 have shown mt − τt = log(Mt /Tt ) = m. Therefore, equations
(4.12) - (4.15) can be expressed equivalently with the shadow rate as in (4.20) - (4.23). 

Retailers

A continuum of retailers of mass 1, indexed by z, buy intermediate goods YtE from entrepreneurs at PtE in
a competitive market, differentiate one unit of goods at no cost into one unit of retail goods Yt (z), and sell
it at the price Pt (z). Final goods Yt are from a CES aggregation of the differentiated goods produced by

demand curve is Y (z) = PtP(z)
Yt , where  is the elasticity of substitution for the CES aggregation.

They face Calvo-stickiness: the sales price can be updated every period with a probability of 1 − θ.
When retailers can optimize the price, they reset it at Pt∗ (z); otherwise, the price is partially indexed to the

Calibration

Table C.1 presents the calibrated parameters. Many of them are from Iacoviello (2005), Fernández-Villaverde
et al. (2015), and Smets and Wouters (2007). For other parameters, we match the following empirical
moments. The steady-state gross inflation is set to 1.005, which implies a 2% annual inflation rate. The
steady-state central bank’s bond holdings ratio matches the average ratio of Fed’ total assets and all sectors’
debt securities and loans in the U.S. during 2003 -2007, which is 2%. The steady-state tax on the gross
interest rate income is set to 1 to imply zero tax on net interest rate income during normal times. The net
quarterly risk premium is set to 0.9% to match the 3.6% average historical annual risk premium.

QE

During normal times, the central bank varies Rt , whereas at the ZLB, it lowers RPt through purchasing
bonds from impatient households and entrepreneurs to decrease the bond supply to patient households. In
this case, we keep the following policy variables constant: MtI = M I , MtE = M E , and Tt = T .
Proposition 1 suggests the following implementation of monetary policy through rbt and rp
b t to obtain

for st < 0.

Lending facilities

In this case, we keep the risk premium constant RtB = Rt RP . At the ZLB, the government can increase the
loan-to-value ratio so that impatient households and entrepreneurs can borrow more money for consumption and production, whereas the patient households still lend according to the borrowing constraints with
constant loan-to-value ratios. Moreover, a tax is placed on interest rate income, which is then transferred to
the borrowers.

No unconventional monetary policy

For the standard model without unconventional monetary policy, replace sbt with rbt in (C.42) - (C.54), and
augment the monetary policy in (C.55) with (2.4).

Notes: We hit the economy with a series of positive preference shocks, which occurs in periods 1 - 15, and the
total shock size is 4%. The red lines represent the case in which, when the policy rate is bounded by zero, no
unconventional monetary policy is implemented. The blue lines represent the case in which unconventional
monetary policy is implemented through a negative shadow rate. Plots 1-7 are levels in percentage, among
which plots 1-6 are annualized. Plots 8-12 are measured in percentage deviation from the steady state. The
shadow rate in plot 1 is an overall measure of monetary policy. In normal times, it is implemented through
the policy rate in plot 2. At the ZLB, it can be implemented through QE in plot 6 (per Section 3) or the
lending facilities (LF) in plots 7 and 8 (per Section 4). The shaded area marks the ZLB period from 8-20.
