The analysis shows that if a rational inflationary bubble exists, then it must have started on the date of initial issuance of the fiat money.  Moreover, the existence of a rational inflationary bubble would imply that, prior to the initial issuance of the fiat money, agents who anticipated its introduction expected a rational inflationary bubble to occur. The analysis also shows that once a rational inflationary bubble bursts it cannot restart. The analysis, however, does not preclude the existence of a rational inflationary bubble that shrinks periodically, but never bursts. The limitations on the inception and existence of rational inflationary bubbles also apply to rational exchange-rate bubbles.\n\n",
