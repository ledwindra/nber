The Visible Hand, The Invisible Hand and Efficiency

NBER Working Paper No. 7587

JEL No. D21, G30
ABSTRACT
When a firm forms a market closes. Resources that were previously allocated via the price
system are allocated by managerial authority within the firm.

We explore this choice of

organizational form using a model of price formation in which agents negotiate prices on behalf of
their principals when there is trade in a market. Principals motivate agents to make efforts and form
prices by writing contracts contingent on the prices that the agents themselves negotiate. Admitting
agency issues into price formation introduces a need for a principal to have the authority to
coordinate economic activity. This can be achieved by closing a market and forming a firm, thereby
contracting directly with both agents, and centrally directing trade. Closing a market, however,
results in a loss of information from market prices, information that can be used to reduce the cost
of contracting. This information cannot be replicated by internally generated “transfer prices.”
Hence, when the market is internalized within the firm, information from market prices is lost.
Choice of organizational form, a market or a firm, is then determined by the relative value of central
authority over agents (the “visible” hand) versus information from market prices (the “invisible”
hand).

“In many sectors of the economy the visible hand of management replaced what Adam Smith referred to
as the invisible hand of market forces. The market remained the generator of demand for goods and
services, but modern business enterprises took over the function of coordinating flows of goods…’’

Introduction
A basic tenet of modern economics is the proposition that prices allocate resources efficiently.

The invisible hand is a system of prices that contain information, without each market participant having
to bear the full cost of producing that information. But, when a firm forms, a market closes; resources
that were previously allocated via the invisible hand of the price system are now allocated by the visible
hand of managerial authority within the firm. Such “centrally planned” internal firm economies can be
very large. Table 1 shows that General Motors has an internal economy roughly the size of a small,
developed, capitalist country. The existence of these planned economies poses the question: What
advantages do firm managers have over markets in allocating resources?
Providing a satisfactory answer to this question requires explaining the essential features of the
modern corporation. Since it is managers, not owners, who allocate resources inside corporations, we
must have a model in which there is a separation of ownership and control, first discussed by Berle and
Means (1932) and later by Jensen and Meckling (1976). But who are the owners? Managers, in fact,
contract with “the corporation.” So, another defining characteristic is the fact that the modern corporation
is a separate entity from its shareholders. It has the power to contract and own property in the corporate
name and, therefore, the shareholders have limited liability. Finally, as a separate legal entity, the
corporation owns the assets.
To be clear, it is difficult to envision General Motors as corresponding to a large number of
entrepreneurs who have banded together to form a “firm.” Of course, such “firms” exist, as partnerships.
But, for a firm to have an internal economy the size of a large company like General Motors requires that
there be agents of the “firm” who are directed by someone who may be the owner, or an agent of the
owner, and who, in any case, has the authority or right to direct how resources (e.g., agents’ efforts) are to
be allocated. Then again we are led to ask: What is “authority”? What is the source of this demand for
authority? Why doesn’t the market work?
We address these questions by exploring a principal-agent model with multiple principals and
agents in which agents negotiate prices on behalf of their principals when there is trade between firms.
Principals motivate agents to make efforts and form prices by writing contracts contingent on the prices
that the agents negotiate. These prices are potentially informative with regard to the effort choice of the
agents, thus enhancing allocative efficiency. But, admitting agency issues into price formation introduces
a coordination problem for the principals. Each principal can only write the contract with his own agent

1

and therefore cannot control the effort choice of the other firm's agent.1 This externality can be
internalized if a single principal has the authority to coordinate economic activity by closing the market
and forming a firm, thereby contracting directly with both agents. Closing the intermediate market
however, results in a loss of the information revealed by those market prices and leads to a moral hazard
in teams problem.2 Choice of organizational form, a market or a firm, is then determined by comparing
the relative value of having managerial authority over agents versus having information from market
prices.
The model economy is one in which intermediate goods are produced to be inputs into the
production of final goods. While the production technology is owned by the principal(s), the production
of each type of good, intermediate and final, requires labor inputs from agents. Each agent makes a nonverifiable effort choice, which contributes to the quality of the output good and hence to its final price.
One way of organizing production consists of two firms and a market for inputs. In this case one
principal hires the agent that produces the intermediate good while the other principal hires the agent that
produces the final good. In order for the final good to be produced the upstream firm has to buy the
intermediate input good from the downstream firm. Having made efforts the two agents meet and form a
price at which ownership of the input good is transferred. Compensation for the agents is based on the
prices that they, themselves, negotiate in the input market, as well as the final output price. Alternatively,
production may be organized within a single firm in which case one principal hires both agents and there
is no input market. Rather, the intermediate input good is transferred from one agent to another inside the
firm.
When one principal hires both agents we ask why production is organized this way when there is
the alternative of producing in separate firms. With separate firms, trade of inputs involves prices that,
presumably, are valuable in the allocation of resources (here, agents’ efforts). If production is organized
in a single firm, losing the information from the price (information that cannot be replicated internally, as
we show) and creating a moral hazard in teams problem, what is the countervailing benefit? We answer
this by developing a notion of managerial authority.
A theory of the firm is equivalently a theory of frictions in the price formation process.
Complicated inputs are not sold in Walrasian auctions. How then are such prices formed? We address
this by extending the standard principal-agent model to include an expanded role for the agent. In the
standard principal-agent model an agent makes an unobservable effort choice that, together with a random
realization of nature, results in a “price” for the output. The problem is that the agent can shirk because
he can credibly claim that a low price is the result of a high effort by him and a bad realization of the state

As will be seen, below, this is one of the characteristics that defines the boundary of the firm.

variable. But this story is not complete. In fact, the output of the agent is sold to someone at a price.
Who is this counterparty and how is the price formed? In our model, when there are two firms, the input
good produced by the first agent is sold to the second agent. The two agents meet, form prices, and trade.
The randomness of nature is replaced by the endogenous effort choice of the ‘other agent.’ Extending the
principal-agent model in this way allows us to ask how information, valuable to the principals for
contracting and inducing effort from agents, comes to be in the price.
The trade-off determining the organizational form depends on these agency issues. Each agent is
motivated by the compensation contract that his principal designs. When there are two firms, this
contract, however, is partly based on the prices that the agents negotiate. Since principals cannot
coordinate their contract choices for their agents ex-ante, we say that each principal lacks the authority to
contract with the other principal's agent. Such authority is the benefit of organizing production in a single
firm. The cost of a single firm is the potential loss of information from input prices. This information is
valuable to the principals since it allows them to write less expensive contracts with their agents. But it is
not in the interests of the agents to produce this information. Thus, while these prices give principals an
additional source of information (regarding the investment choice of effort made by their agent), because
of the agency problem in price formation, the principals must sometimes bear a cost if they want prices to
be informative. The cost is one of enforcing constraints that induce agents to form prices that maximize
the profits of their principals. Prices are only valuable for principals if they can obtain some of the
information for free. This is the essence of a price system.3 In the context of our paper, getting some
information for free means that each principal need not enforce some constraints on his agent’s
compensation contracts all of the time.
We develop the price formation process in a series of steps to clarify how principals may obtain
some information that they do not pay for from the price. We start with a simple benchmark model in
which agents are symmetrically informed about each other's effort choices when they meet. We show
that, in this case, the input price contains no additional informational value relative to the final output
price. Thus, the input price is of no incremental value in allocating effort resources and, consequently, a
(single) firm is the optimal organizational form. We then introduce asymmetric information by assuming
that (without loss of generality) one of the agents may be uninformed about the effort choice of the other
agent. We find that input prices have an informational role (beyond that of output prices) but, depending
on the bargaining game played by the agents when they form prices, principals may or may not benefit
from this information because of possible strategic behavior by the agents. Finally, we focus on the most
2

This terminology, “moral hazard in teams,” is due to Holmstrom (1982). Holmstrom assumed that the firm could
not be split up into separate firms that then trade with each other.

The classic paper on this subject is by Hayek (1945). Also related is Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) who address the
issue of how there can be information in prices if information is costly to produce.

interesting case in which input prices provide principals some information for free. In this scenario, the
trade-off between the two organizational forms becomes nontrivial. There is a benefit to having the
market, namely there is some “free,” but valuable, information in prices, but there is a cost to having the
market as well, namely, principals are unable to coordinate their contract choices. They lack authority
over each other’s agent.
We then explore which organizational form is socially efficient and which is privately efficient
from the viewpoint of the agents and from the viewpoint of the principals. In our model principals may
be thought of as the outside shareholders of a firm (or their representatives, e.g., the board of directors).
Agents may be viewed as CEOs/managers. Perhaps surprisingly we find that agents always make the
socially efficient organizational choice, but principals do not. The reason is this. When forming prices
each agent can extract rents from his principal due to the externality provided by the other principal’s
agent. In the single firm, the lack of a market price allows agents to extract some rents because of the
moral hazard in teams problem. In either organizational form rents are highest when contracts are
consistent with both agents making high effort choices (this is when the incentive compatibility
constraints bind). Consequently, agents choose the organizational form where principals will give them
contracts that induce high effort choices. From the point of view of the principals, however, a different
organizational form may be privately optimal. If agents can extract too much from principals when they
both make high efforts, principals might prefer an organizational form where low effort is made. Since in
our model high effort is socially efficient, the result follows.
Finally, we ask why is it not possible to replicate the information in market prices through
internally generated “transfer” prices? The answer is related to property rights and limited liability. In
the market, a necessary condition for there to be a transfer of ownership of the input good from one firm
to the other is that both agents agree on a price. If agents disagree on a price, there is no trade, the
principals earn no money and therefore, cannot pay their agents (due to limited liability of principals). In
fact, the principals have formed a “corporation,” and it is this entity that (implicitly) has contracted with
the agents. Agents understand this and must therefore agree on a price in order to transfer property rights
to the good. In this way, competition between principal-agent pairs in the market induces informative
prices.
On the other hand, internal “trade” involves no transfer of property rights. When there is one
principal/corporation who hires both agents, that principal may instruct her agents to send her signals so
as to replicate market prices. But such signals are not informative (equivalently, no signals will be sent)
since the principal’s threat of withholding compensation if no signals are reported is not a credible one.
The principal’s limited liability constraint does not bind. Internally, a trade between divisions of a firm
can take place without there being an agreement on a transfer price. Since no transfer of property rights is

4

involved the principal, faced with uninformative signals, will always choose to continue with production
and get positive profits. Thus, while she gains the authority to contract with both agents, she loses
information.
The notion that the principal has limited liability is critical to our argument about transfer prices;
it means that the principal cannot be forced to pay agents if the “firm” has not sold any output. In other
words, the principal is not a person but a “corporation.” That is, there exists a legal notion,
“incorporation,” which allows the firm to be distinct from the individual person who is the principal.
Incorporation means that the entity, the “firm,” has limited liability. Though the legal notion of a limited
liability corporation is a rather recent invention (see Hunt (1936)), the ability to incorporate effectively
allowed for limited liability.4 In our analysis the existence of firms, in the sense of legal corporations—
the entities that Berle and Means studied—depends on this legal concept. The existence of partnerships
or entrepreneurial firms does not require this legal notion and, indeed, these are the only ‘firms” that
existed prior to the development of the idea of the “corporation.” In this sense there is a close link
between law and finance in our analysis, somewhat akin to recent ideas of La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes,
Shleifer and Vishny (1997, 1998). At the end of the paper we briefly discuss further the role of the legal
notion of a corporation.
This paper is related to the vast literature on the theory of the firm. See Holmstrom and Tirole
(1989) and Hart (1989) for surveys. Earlier work on the theory of the firm includes Coase (1937, 1988),
Alchian and Demsetz (1972), Williamson (1970, 1975, 1979, 1985, 1988), and Jensen and Meckling
(1976). Coase was the first to draw attention to the idea that firms and markets allocate resources
differently. He identified the role of the firm as coordinating economic activity in situations where the
market fails to do so. Alchian and Demsetz, as well as Williamson, argue that firms form when the cost
of transacting via the market is too high. They identify features of market transactions that are costly,
including asset specificity, the duration of the relationship between the transacting parties, and the ability
to identify the marginal productivity of inputs. Recent theories of the firm include Grossman and Hart
(GH) (1986), and Hart and Moore (HM) (1990).5

Limited liability per se is not the issue as this concept was essentially an after-thought to the legal notion of the
“corporation.” In English common law an express concept of limited liability was not needed because the idea that
the corporation was a separate person allowed for the contractual construction of limited liability. Henn and
Alexander (1983) write that: “Limited liability of the shareholder with respect to claims of creditors of the
corporation is illusory because the corporation usually … had the power to make leviations (calls and assessments)
on its shareholders for money to pay its liabilities and its creditors could derivatively assert such corporate power
directly against the shareholders by a process resembling subrogation. By legal ingenuity, the corporation’s power
to make levies on its shareholders was expressly excluded or limited—thus achieving limited liability” (p. 19).

5

More recent work, extending the GH and HM ideas, include Rajan and Zingales (1998) and de Meza and
Lockwood (1998).

5

In many ways, this literature provides an entrepreneurial theory of the firm (or a theory of the
entrepreneurial firm). In criticizing some of the earlier work, Fama (1980) writes that: “…this literature
fails to explain the large modern corporation in which control of the firm is in the hands of managers who
are more or less separate from the firm’s security holders” (p.289). Our work is distinct from the previous
work in several important ways. First, we focus on explaining the important attributes of the modern
corporation. The modern corporation is a separate entity from its shareholders and has the power to
contract and own property in the corporate name; there is a separation of ownership and control; there is
limited liability.6 Thus, we do not focus on an owner/manager; it is not an entrepreneurial theory of the
firm. Thus, as opposed to GH and HM, we start with principal-agent relationships as already given, and
do not explain why they have arisen. Our model formalizes some of the ideas in Holmstrom (1999)
critical of GH and HM and follows up on the discussion of Bolton and Scharfstein (1998) that a theory of
the firm should incorporate the separation of ownership and control. Finally, as briefly explained above,
the notion of the corporation and limited liability is important in our theory; it is not simply a legal fiction
serving as a “nexus of contracts,” as in Jensen and Meckling (1976).
A second focus of ours is on the idea of authority. Alchian and Demsetz (1972) object to the
notion of “authority,” arguing that contracts are voluntary. In our model, agents voluntarily enter into
contracts, but there is still a role for “authority.” We seek to explore the meaning of authority, first
discussed in this context by Coase, by presenting a model in which the idea arises naturally. Our notion
of authority is similar to that of a "coordination effect" introduced in Stole and Zwiebel (1999).
To summarize, we propose a theory of the corporation, as opposed to a theory of the firm.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section II we describe the model economy. Section III
develops the benchmark case of symmetric information and Nash bargaining. Section IV introduces
asymmetric information and a simple reduced-form model of bargaining. Section V solves the full model
with take-it-or-leave-it offers when there is asymmetric information. In Section VI we analyze the
relative social and private efficiency of the two forms of organization. Section VII addresses the issue of
why internal transfer prices cannot replicate market prices. Finally, Section VIII concludes. Proofs are in
an Appendix.
II.

The Model Economy
We consider an economy in which both intermediate goods and final goods are produced.

Intermediate goods are used as inputs for the production of final goods. Production of both goods
requires labor inputs from agents. Principal(s) own the production technologies and hire agents (to
6

Other attributes include centralization of management in the board of directors and ready transferability of shares.

supply effort) in a labor market. We consider two ways of organizing the production of the final good. In
one case, hereafter called Non-Integration, production takes place in two firms. Firm one produces the
intermediate input good and then sells it to the second firm in a market. The second firm then uses this
input to produce the final output good. When production takes place in two separate firms, there are two
principals, one (implicitly) owning the technology that produces the intermediate good and the other
(implicitly) owning the technology that produces the final good. Each principal hires an agent who
supplies the effort for production and the skills to trade with the other firm. In order for the final good to
be produced the upstream firm has to buy the intermediate input good from the downstream firm. The
agents from each firm meet and bargain to determine a price at which the input good is traded.
In the second case, which we refer to as Integration, all the production takes place in one firm. A
single principal owns both technologies and hires both agents so that there is no market for the
intermediate input good. “Trade” then occurs inside the firm. There is no “price” associated with the
transfer of the good inside the firm. Below, we make clear what this means. In that regard, however,
note that in the first case, Non-Integration, property rights to the input good change hands in the market
transaction, while in the second case, Integration, there is no transfer of property rights.
Production works as follows. Each agent makes a nonverifiable discrete effort choice, e , with

e ∈ {eH , eL } and eH > eL . An agent, called A1, makes an effort choice that determines the quality of the
intermediate input good. A second agent, called A2, combines his effort choice with the intermediate
input good to make the final good. Because effort choices are discrete there are four possible quality
states for the final output: HH, HL, LH, and LL, where the first letter represents the effort choice of A1
and the second letter represents the effort choice of A2. The state HL, for example, represents the
outcome where A1 made a high effort and A2 made a low effort. The quality of the final output, and
hence its price, depend upon the quality of both the input good (i.e., the effort choice of A1) and the effort
choice of A2. Thus, while the quality of the input good only depends on A1’s effort choice, e H or e L ,
the quality of the final output depends on A2’s effort choice as well as A1’s. Agents have a disutility of
effort denoted by Φ ( ei ) ≡ Φ i with Φ H > Φ L . Finally, similar to previous work, we focus on the ex
ante effort choices made by A1 and A2. Namely, we focus on the effort choices made by the two agents
before they meet.
The price of the final product is given by Pij where the first subscript refers to the effort choice of
A1 and the second subscript refers to the effort choice of A2, so i, j ∈ {H , L} . These prices are taken to
be exogenous, satisfying the following assumptions:

7

Assumption 1: PHH > PHL = PLH > PLL and PHH − PHL < PLH − PLL .
The second property is the usual neoclassical assumption reflecting the concavity of the production
function with respect to investment (of effort). The first property allows us to capture two basic ideas in
the simplest way possible. One is that the more effort expended the higher is the value of the final
product. The other is that prices are noisy in the sense that principals cannot fully disentangle the state of
nature from observing the final good price.7 Namely, the price of the final good does not allow principals
to differentiate between the states HL and LH. Without loss of generality we make the following
additional assumption:
Assumption 2: PHH − 2Φ H > PHL − Φ H − Φ L > PLL − 2Φ L .
Assumption 2 says that the socially efficient investment is for both agents to make a high effort. This will
serve as a benchmark to which we can compare other equilibria. Whenever the equilibrium does not
entail high effort from both agents we say that the First Best has not been achieved. (Satisfying
Assumptions 1 and 2) we will express the final price as:

Pij = A + Φ i + Φ j + I (i , j )
where A>0 ,




for (i, j ) = ( H , H )

and 0 < ε < 1 . In Figure 1 we plot this production function. From the figure it is clear that the marginal
profit is always greater than the marginal cost of effort and that this difference is decreasing (i.e., the
production function is concave).
We also assume:

8

Assumption 3: Both principals and agents are risk neutral in final wealth and both have limited liability.
For agents limited liability means that the contract offered to an agent has to, at the very least, compensate
him for his cost of effort. 8 For the principals limited liability means that if the final output is not
produced and no profits are made, they cannot be forced to honor the contracts signed with their agents.
While limited liability can be justified for principals on the same grounds that it can be justified for
agents, we can also think of limited liability for the principals as corresponding to the notion that equity
holders of a firm cannot be made to invest more than their initial equity.
Our economy is one of incomplete contracting. The incompleteness of contracts results from
effort not being a verifiable quantity. Principals, however, can write (verifiable) contracts contingent on
prices. In general this means that contracts can be written on both the price of the final product as well as
the price of the intermediate product (if this price exists). Both principals observe both prices.
In the final goods market prices are not fully revealing (Assumption 1). Our focus is on how the
input good price is formed and how information from that market helps resolve the informational
problems of the output market. An important difference between the intermediate input market and the
final good market in our setting is that the market for the final output is (implicitly) a market in which
there are many agents, some informed, bidding for the final good. The market for the intermediate input
good is a bilateral market in which there is not necessarily information aggregation. The intermediate
input good price will depend on whether A1 and A2 are informed and how they bargain.
When production takes place in two firms, the agents, having been hired and having made their
effort choices, search for trading partners at a cost. We assume that the cost of searching is sufficiently
high so as to guarantee that the principals prefer that the agents negotiate a price and trade with each other
rather than go and search for another partner. Alternatively, one can look at the situation where the two
agents make relationship specific investments and hence are better off trading with each other in this
bilateral monopoly.9 Finally, while it is possible to assume that agents either bargain over their own
surplus or over the surplus of their firm we make the following assumption:
7

This is the standard assumption made in agency models where the contracts can be written on noisy signals of the
true effort choice.
8
We interpret limited liability as an ex-ante constraint on the contracts offered to the agents. Contracts that may
result in losses to agents are therefore forbidden. For a more elaborate discussion of limited liability see
Sappington (1983).
9

The notion that the two parties are locked into the relationship and must therefore reach an agreement is a common
assumption among papers that deal with the theory of the firm. (See for example GH (1986), HM (1990)). An
alternative interpretation is of an investment-specific relationship. Once the investment has been made there is
additional value when staying with your partner compared to searching for a new one. In the words of Williamson

9

Assumption 4: When agents negotiate a price in the intermediate input market, they seek to maximize
their firm’s total surplus.
This assumption is made for simplicity. Although agents choose prices so as to maximize their
companies’ surpluses they are still concerned with their own utility levels. An agent will make an effort
choice to maximize his compensation based on the wages offered to him under the contract with the
principal. Moreover, these wage contracts have to be such that it will be in the interests of the agents to
agree to transact with each other at the specified prices. The basic issue concerns how an agent behaves
when he negotiates a price on behalf of his principal. A strong form of agency problems would assume
that agents bargain for prices that maximize their individual utility levels. We adopt a weaker view,
namely, that while agents make unverifiable effort choices they do seek to maximize their firm’s surplus
when they bargain. Implicitly, this view is a reduced form for noncontractual institutions and influences
that enforce this objective function.
III.

The Benchmark Case: Organizational Choice With Fully Informed Agents
We begin the analysis with a benchmark case in which the agents are fully informed about the

quality of the intermediate input good being traded in the market. This means that A2 is costlessly
informed about the effort choice of A1 and A1 is costlessly informed about the effort choice of A2. Thus,
the quality state of both the input and the output goods are known to the agents when they meet, though
effort is not verifiable. In this benchmark setting, we examine the optimal organizational choice and
show that Integration into a single firm weakly dominates Non-Integration.
The analysis proceeds by first examining the case of Non-Integration and then considering the
case of Integration. The solution to the Integration case of this section will be the same throughout the
remaining models of price formation that come later in the paper.
A. Non-Integration With Fully Informed Agents
The sequence of events is as follows:
1. Principals hire agents in the labor market, signing compensation contracts.
2. A1 and A2 make effort choices.
(1979): “The transactions that I wish to emphasize here, however, are exchanges of the recurring kind. Although
large-numbers competition is frequently feasible at the initial award stage for recurring contracts of all kinds,
idiosyncratic transactions are ones for which the relationship between buyer and supplier is quickly thereafter
transformed into one of bilateral monopoly-on account of the transaction-specific costs…”(p. 241).

10

3. A1 and A2 search for trading partners, meet, and bargain. As a result of the bargaining game
a price is formed.
4. Trade of the input good takes place at the negotiated price.
5. A2 sells the final product in the output market and agents receive their compensation.
As was assumed in Assumption 4, agents Nash bargain over the total surplus of their companies.
In this case then the prices in the market for the input good will correspond to the “quality” states, as
follows:

State
HH

Price
PH

LH

PM

HL

PM

LL

PL

Using the Nash bargaining solution, and assuming both agents have an outside option of zero, we have
that PH , for example, is the solution to max ( PHH − p )α ( p − 0)1−α where for the rest of the paper we
P

take the case of symmetric bargaining power, α = 0.5 . Notice that the assumption of Nash bargaining
means that the prices of the intermediate input good have the same informational content as do the prices
of the final output. In other words there is a one-to-one correspondence between the input price and the
final output price. This observation is enough to tell us that the allocative role of prices in the input
market is not particularly important.
A.1 Optimal Contracts: The Input Producer
We first solve for the optimal contract that P1 offers A1. The optimal contract can either induce a
high effort from A1 or a low effort. Contracts will be contingent on observed input and final good
prices.10 An important feature of the optimization problem facing P1 is the dependence of her firm’s
profits on the decision made by the second firm (i.e., A2’s effort choice). In order to specify P1’s
problem we need to define her belief regarding the effort choice of the agent outside of her authority, A2.
Let q be the probability assessment of P1 that A2 will make a high effort choice. Of course A2’s effort
choice depends on his contract with P2. Given the belief q, limited liability, and the price formation
10

While one can imagine P1 only being able to write a contract contingent on the price of the intermediate good, we
focus on the case where P1 can contract on both the intermediate good price and the final output price. In Appendix
C we consider the case where P1 cannot contract on the final output price. There we show that the main difference
in the equilibrium is that the equilibrium with less information given to P1 is actually more efficient.

mechanism, P1 has to compare her profits from inducing a high effort to her profits from inducing a low
effort from A1. We derive the optimal contract under each alternative and obtain a condition on q under
which the optimal contract induces high effort.
Let WIJK be the wage paid to A1 by P1 when prices PIJ and PK are reported. PIJ is the final
output price while PK is the intermediate input price. When inducing a high effort from A1 the
maximization problem for P1 is to choose wages to:

way for her to prove that PM corresponds to the state LH and not to the state HL. Thus, P1 must still offer

A.2 Optimal Contracts: The Output Producer
Now consider P2. Like P1, P2 can write contracts contingent on both the price of the
intermediate input good and the price of the final output. Let b denote the probability assessment of P2
that A1 will produce a high quality input good. When deciding to induce a high effort from A2, P2
chooses the compensation contract to solve:

Proof: Obvious.
An equilibrium is: (1) a set of contracts designed by the principals to maximize their respective
expected utilities; (2) effort choices by each agent such that their expected utilities are maximized given
the contracts; and (3) correct beliefs, held by each player, regarding the choices of the other players.
Combining the above conditions results in a Nash equilibrium. While we do not need to solve for the
actual equilibrium b and q for the analysis of this section we give the proposition describing the
equilibrium, Proposition B1, and its proof in Appendix B.
B. Integration
In the case of Integration, all production takes place within a single firm in which a single
principal owns both technologies and hires both agents. One principal then has the authority to write the
contracts of both agents. However, the input market does not exist and so agents do not need to agree on
an input price in order for property rights to the input good to be transferred from one division (agent) to
another. The single principal though may ask the agents to report signals of quality. We call such signals
“transfer prices” and analyze them in Section VII where we will show that these transfer prices cannot
replicate the information in market prices.
To solve for the equilibrium we need to find the optimal contracts written by the principal and the
effort choices made by the two agents. Since the compensation of each agent depends on the effort made
by the other agent too, each agent has to have a belief about what the other agent will do. As before we
let q denote the probability assessment that A1 has regarding the chance that A2 will make a high effort
choice. Similarly, let b denote the probability assessment that A2 has regarding the chance that A1 will

14

make a high effort choice. Note that the single principal has the authority to optimally choose both
contracts, which in equilibrium implies that she chooses both of these probabilities. This is so because in
equilibrium the principal’s contract choices and the beliefs, b and q, must be consistent with the actions
taken by the agents. Given the beliefs b and q, the principal solves:

Max {Wij } {qb( PHH − 2WHH ) + [q(1 − b) + b(1 − q)]( PHL − 2WHL ) + (1 − q )(1 − b)( PLL − 2WLL )}
Subject to:

WHH ≥ Φ H
WHL ≥ Φ H
WLL ≥ Φ L
b(WHH − Φ H ) + (1 − b)(WHL − Φ H ) ≥ b(WHL − Φ L ) + (1 − b)(WLL − Φ L )
q(WHH − Φ H ) + (1 − q)(WHL − Φ H ) ≥ q(WHL − Φ L ) + (1 − q )(WLL − Φ L )
The objective function is simply the expected value of the principal’s profits. The first three constraints
are limited liability constraints while the last two are incentive compatibility constraints for A1 and A2.
Lemma 5: The optimal contracts are given by:
i. For {q, b} ≠ 0 : WHH = Φ H + ∆Φ ; WHL = Φ H ; WLL = Φ L .
ii. Else:

WHH = Φ H ; WHL = Φ H ; WLL = Φ L .

Proof: See Appendix A.
This leads to the following equilibrium:
Proposition 1: The equilibrium consists of the contracts specified in Lemma 5 and the following beliefs
q* and b* that depend on the marginal cost of effort ∆Φ ≡ Φ H − Φ L as follows:
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε :

q * = b* = 1 .

ii. For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 : q * = 0 , b * = 1 ; q * = 1 , b * = 0 .
iii. For 1 < ∆Φ :

q * = b* = 0 .

Proof: To find the equilibrium we need to solve for the optimal q * and b * . Given the optimal
contracts, the principal’s objective function is:

15

qb( PHH − 2Φ H − 2 ∆Φ ) + [q(1 − b) + b(1 − q )]( PHL − 2Φ H ) + (1 − q )(1 − b) A .
The principal will choose q* and b* depending on the relation between PHH − 2Φ H − 2 ∆Φ (both agents
make a high effort), PHL − 2Φ H (one agent makes a high effort), and A (both agents make a low effort).
These are equivalent to, A + 1 + ε − 2 ∆Φ , A + 1 − ∆Φ , and A respectively. Then depending on ∆Φ ,
the principal will choose either q*=b*=1, q*=b*=0, or q*=1 and b*=0.
Recall our assumption that the First Best solution is to make a high effort, i.e., that

PHH − 2Φ H > PHL − Φ H − Φ L > PLL − 2Φ L .
In comparison, from the equilibrium conditions stated in Proposition 1, both agents make a high effort if
and only if:

PHH − 4Φ H + 2Φ L > PHL − 2Φ H ,

(1)

while one agent makes a high effort if and only if:
PHL − 2Φ H > PLL − 2Φ L .

(2)

Given our definition of the price function Pij , (1) and (2) are equivalent to:

A + (1 − ∆Φ ) + (ε − ∆Φ ) > A + (1 − ∆Φ )

(1`)

A + (1 − ∆Φ ) > A .

(2`)

and

If (2`) holds then the principal will induce only one agent to make a high effort choice. If (1`) holds too,
then the principal will induce both agents to make a high effort choice.
Recall that ∆Φ is the marginal cost of effort to the agents. The marginal product of the first high
effort made is 1 + ∆Φ , while ε + ∆Φ is the marginal product of the second high effort made.
Depending on the relation between ∆Φ , 1 and ε the principal either induces high effort from both
agents, from one agent, or decides not to induce any effort from either agent. Notice that this equilibrium
does not always result in First Best efficiency. Unlike an unconstrained social planner, the principal does
not necessarily induce both agents to make high effort choices even though she can control the actions of
both (through the contracts she writes). The reason for this deviation from the efficient outcome is that
limited liability and the ability of agents to hide behind each other allows them to extract some of the
surplus from the principal.11

11

This problem is the “moral hazard in teams” problem analyzed in Holmstrom (1982).

16

C. Which Hand: Visible or Invisible?
Having solved for the optimal contracts for each organizational form we can now prove that the
principals prefer Integration over Non-Integration.
Proposition 2: When input prices are formed by fully informed agents based on Nash bargaining,
principals always (weakly) prefer to integrate into a single firm.
Proof: While the proposition can be shown by direct calculation of the total profits under each
organizational form, it is also clear through inspection of the contracts. Looking at the optimal contracts
above in the case of Integration, note that for any b and q chosen in the equilibrium, the contracts are the
same as those in the case of Non-Integration. Thus, the combined profit of the principals can only be
higher in the case of Non-Integration if they are able to choose a better combination of q and b. But, in
the case of Integration one principal has the authority to write both contracts, choosing both b and q,
while in the Non-Integration case P1 chooses b and P2 chooses q. It is clear then that Integration will
provide the principal with a weakly dominating profit.
The result in Proposition 2 should not be surprising. Intuitively, separating production into two
firms has two affects. The first is the introduction of a coordination problem for the two principals who
now compete with each other. The second is the introduction of the input price, which may potentially
provide information to each principal regarding the effort choice of her agent. Since, in this case, the
informational content of the input price is the same as that of the final output price, the separation into
two firms only creates a coordination problem for the principals (the choices of q and b are now done
separately) without giving them any countervailing informational benefits regarding whether the true state
is HL or LH. In other words the intermediate input price is redundant in terms of the information it
provides to principals. Thus, the intermediate input price is serving no allocational role.
IV.

Costly Information Production by Both Principals and Agents
The above benchmark case assumed that agents were costlessly informed about the quality of the

intermediate input when it was sold in the market. We saw that, in equilibrium, there was no
informational content to the input prices beyond that already conveyed in the output prices. In this
section we take a first step towards a different scenario in which the input markets prices will eventually
have an informational role. Realistically, the quality of complicated input goods is not easily determined
and so, in this section, we assume costly information production by agents, in addition to principals.

17

Specifically, we assume that A2's ability to detect the quality of the input good depends on his
effort choice. In other words, it is costly for A2, the input buyer, to determine whether A1 has made a
high effort. This means that if A2 makes a low effort (and hence does not produce information) he is
uninformed when he buys the input and this adversely affects the quality of the final output. On the other
hand, if A2 makes a high effort, then he is informed about the quality of the input, which has a positive
affect on the quality of the final output. Thus, effort affects the quality of the final output, but also
determines whether A2 can judge the quality of the input good.12
A. Input Market
Our assumption regarding information production is:
Assumption 5: A2 is informed about A1’s effort choice (and hence about the quality of the input good)
only when he makes a high effort. If he makes a low effort choice, he is uninformed.
The interpretation is this: When A2 makes a high effort we assume he develops the skills and knowledge
to identify the quality of the intermediate good which then allows him to adjust production so as to
maximize the quality of the final output good. However, when A2 makes a low effort he remains
uninformed regarding the quality of the input good and that results in a final output of lower quality.
If A2 makes a high effort choice, then when A1 and A2 meet, there is full information so that
they form the price as before, that is, according to Nash bargaining. However, when A1 and A2 meet and
A2 has made a low effort, A2 is uninformed and so there is asymmetric information between the two
parties. Hence they cannot Nash bargain. In this section, we do not completely specify a bargaining game
for price determination when A2 is uninformed. Rather, we adopt the minimalist assumption that:
Assumption 6: When A2 is uninformed the agents agree on a single price P , where P < PM < PH .
The assumption specifies a price that a rational A2 will demand. The logic is this. When A2 makes a low
effort, the best case scenario for him is that the final output is worth PHL (which corresponds to him paying

PM ), thus he will not be willing to pay more than this upper bound as this will reveal that he did not make
a high effort. How much below PM the price P is, we do not say, as this would depend on relative
bargaining power. Under Assumption 6, the input price/quality schedule takes the form:
12

While it is also possible to think of A1, as well as A2, as being either informed or uninformed, we analyze the
simpler case in which A1 is always informed about the potential use of his product.

Note that observing the input price together with the output price allows one to fully separate the states
HL and LH. Taken together, the input price and the output price are now fully informative. Recall that
when observing the output price alone principals cannot distinguish between the states HL and LH. Now
having the input price too allows them to separate between these two states since in the state HL the input
price is P while in the state LH it is PM .
The input price and the final output price, together, will reveal the true (quality) state. But, that is
only true if the agents, who have to agree on the input price when they bargain, actually do behave
according to the above price/quality schedule. If agents behave strategically to maximize their
compensation, then this may not be true.
Given the quality state of the input good, prices are chosen to maximize the firm's surplus.
However, in order for agents to agree on these prices at the corresponding states it must be the case that
their contracts give them the incentives to do so. In particular, agents may offer their counterparty a
different price in some of the states if this price results in higher compensation to them and higher profits
for the counterparty. That is, agents may find it mutually beneficial to manipulate the input price, by
choosing a price that is inconsistent with the true quality state. For this reason, although the prices
specified above will provide additional information, it will come at a cost to each of the principals.
Namely, principals will have to pay their agents in order for them to transact at those given prices in the
given states. We will show that, as a result of this cost, principals will still prefer to organize into a single
firm, Integration. Forming prices in this way results in input market prices that do not provide principals
with any ‘free information’.
B. Optimal Contracts: The Input Producer
As before we first solve for the optimal contract that P1 offers A1. However, since agents care
about their wages rather than their company's profits, managers need to offer contracts that are increasing
in the firms’ profits so that managers will choose the prices that maximize the firms’ profits. This will
require additional constraints on the contracts.
When inducing a high effort from A1 the maximization problem for P1 is to choose wages to:

19

. Since the principal cares about her
constraint. The interesting constraint is the fifth one, WLH

profits, she is better off receiving the higher price PM rather than the price of P since PM > P . Her
agent, however, does not care about his principal's profits, but rather about his own salary. Since
receiving a price of PM reveals that he has made a low effort and since the other agent will always agree
to pay a lower price than is specified in the mechanism, the agent will only sell the input for the higher
price if his salary provides him with sufficient compensation. Thus, it is costly to enforce this constraint.
In this sense the prices, although informative, do not provide the principal with any free information.
Henceforth, we will call this constraint the ‘non-manipulation’ constraint.

having to pay her agent the same amount she would have paid him had she not known the true state. To
reiterate, it is in this sense that prices are informative, but at a cost.

Note the non-manipulation constraint: WHL

. While prices are fully revealing, because of the

agency problem and the fact that the agent cares only about his compensation, he is better off buying the
input at the higher price, which reflects that he made a high effort. Since the first firm’s (P1’s) agent will

21

obviously be willing to accept a higher price, the principal, P2, has to offer her agent a set of contracts
that assures her that her agent will buy the input at the lowest price possible. With the non-manipulation
constraint, prices, although fully revealing, do not save the principal any money.

As before, an equilibrium is: (1) a set of contracts designed by the principals to maximize their
respective expected utilities; (2) effort choices by each agent such that their expected utilities are
maximized given the contracts; and (3) correct beliefs, held by each player, regarding the choices of the
other players. Combining the above conditions results in equilibrium. This is a set of conditions on the
exogenous parameters that lead to different outcomes for b and q. For the analysis in this section we do
not need to derive the equilibrium q * and b * . For that reason we leave the calculation of the equilibrium
to Proposition B2 in Appendix B.
D. Which Hand: Visible or Invisible?
Having solved for the optimal contracts we can now prove that the principals will always prefer
to organize production in a single firm.

22

Proposition 3: When agents choose a single price P whenever A2 makes a low effort, and is therefore
uninformed about the quality of the input good, then the principals always (weakly) prefer to integrate
into a single firm.
Proof: As was the case before, this result can be directly checked by calculation the profits for each case.
But, one can easily verify that the contracts given to agents are the same in the case of Integration and
Non-Integration. But, the integrated organization has the advantage of coordination. Namely, in the case
of Integration one principal chooses both q * and b * while in the case of Non-Integration P1 chooses b *
while P2 chooses q * , non-cooperatively.

Interestingly, there is no benefit from the information in input prices. The reason is that while this
information allows the principals to relax the limited liability constraints and hence reduce the cost of
contracting, there are additional non-manipulation constraints that must be satisfied. So, although prices
allow the principals to identify the state in which their agent made a low effort the non-manipulation
constraints force them to pay fully for that information.
To summarize, with costly information production by A2, agents must still form a price when A2
is uninformed. When there is a single price that the agents agree to in this situation, principals must take
account of the strategic behavior of agents. But, this is costly for principals. Producing information, by
paying for non-manipulation by the agents, does not allow principals to gain any ‘free’ information from
prices. The market has no advantage over the firm.
V.

Costly Information Production and the Take-It–Or-Leave-It Game
In this section we maintain the above assumptions about costly information production and

specify a simple bargaining game to be played when A2 is uninformed, by virtue of having made a low
effort. The bargaining game dramatically alters the role of the input price. Specifically, it will allow for
prices that give principals some information for which they do not have to pay.
A. Overview
The previous section simply specified that when A2 was uninformed trade occurred at one price,

P . In this section we will be more specific about the price formation process. Instead of Assumption 6,
we now assume:

23

Assumption 7: When the buyer, A2, is uninformed, the two agents’ bargain by playing a take-it-or-leaveit game where each agent gets to make the offer with equal probability.13
When the game is take-it-or-leave-it we assume that each agent will suggest a price that extracts the entire
surplus from the other firm (subject to the constraint that the other firm will have sufficient funds to pay
its agent).14 The price/quality schedule takes the following form:15

State

Price

HH

PH

LH

PM

 A1 offers P w.p. 0.5
HL & LL
 A2 offers P w.p. 0.5
P is the maximum price A2 is willing to pay A1 subject to the condition that his firm’s profits be
sufficient to pay him his wage. Since A2 cannot distinguish between the states HL and LL, P is paid in
both states. Thus, we get that: P = PLL − Φ L . When observing P , P2 understands that A2 made a low
effort and hence need only pay him his disutility of effort Φ L . The above price then assures that if the
state is LL, P2 gets zero net profits. Similarly, P is the lowest price that gives P1 zero profits after
paying A1 his promised compensation. Thus, P = Φ H .16 We naturally assume that: P ≤ PM and

PH ≤ P .
Are the input prices providing valuable information to the principals? Recall that the only
information the principals need, in order to eliminate the agency costs (of not being able to contract
directly on the agents’ investment decision), is whether the state is HL or LH. Observing the input price
allows principals to separate the two states since different input prices are negotiated in each state. Thus,
input prices help reduce the principals’ cost of inducing effort. However, unlike the previous case we will
show that the principals can get some of this information for free due to the competition between the two
agents and the form of the bargaining game.

13

There is some literature on bargaining under asymmetric information, which gives support to this choice of
specification. For example, Samuelson (1984) shows that when there is asymmetric information, similar to ours,
between a buyer and a seller the optimal mechanism is for each to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
14
The results remain the same if we assume that the take-it-or-leave-it price extracts the entire surplus.
15
We will show that in equilibrium agents will trade and it will be in their interest to do so.

Proof: Obvious.
Note that the agent still gets some rents when he makes a low effort choice and A2 makes a high
effort choice. Again, the reason is that the non-manipulation constraint binds. From Lemma 11 we see
that the principal’s profit is:

Although these four prices are the only ones that will appear in equilibrium we have to specify the compensation
for any reported price. Clearly, A1 is indifferent between reporting the appropriate specified price if for any other

Proposition 4: Let ∆P ≡ PH − PM . The principal, P1, writes a contract that induces high effort from his
agent, A1, if and only if: q ≥

∆Φ
.
∆P

Proof: Compare the profits in (3) and (4) above.
Proposition 4 demonstrates the externality that arises for P1 due to the price formation in the

input market and the inability to contract with A2. The condition says that P1 will induce a high effort
from A1 only if she believes that the chance, q, that P2 will induce a high effort from A2 is sufficiently
high. If, on the other hand, she believes that A2 will make a low effort, then she is better off inducing a
low effort from her agent too. Why is this true? From the point of view of P1, if P2 induces a high effort
from A2, then P1’s marginal benefit from inducing a high effort from A1 (gross of wages) is PH − PM .
If, however, P2 does not induce A2 to make a high effort, then the marginal benefit to P1 from inducing a
high effort from A1 is zero. This is simply because when A2 makes a low effort the price is formed via
take-it-or-leave-it offers and, hence, does not reflect A1’s effort choice. Since P1 also considers the
additional contracting cost of inducing high effort, she will only do so if she believes that the probability
that A2 made a high effort is sufficiently high. As will be seen in the next section this intuition does not
hold for P2.
C. Optimal Contracts: The Output Producer
Now consider P2. Like P1, P2 can write contracts contingent on both the price of the
intermediate input good and the price of the final output. Let b denote the probability assessment of P2
that A1 will produce a high quality input good. When deciding to induce a high effort from A2, P2
chooses the compensation contract to solve:

Subject to:

price X, P1 specifies a payment of W ( PLL , X ) = Φ L and W ( PHH , X ) = W ( PHL , X ) = Φ H . Also, if negotiations
breakdown, principals’ limited liability binds and agents get nothing.

As before, in addition to the standard incentive compatibility constraint and the limited liability
constraints we have the non-manipulation constraint that assures P2 that A2 will offer to pay the lower
price P rather than PM when he gets to make the take-it-or-leave-it offer.

Proof: Compare the profits of the principal from (5) and (6).
Proposition 5 shows the externality faced by P2 due to A1’s independent effort choice decision.
In this case, P2 chooses to induce high effort from her agent only if she believes that the probability, b, of
A1 making a high effort is sufficiently low. P2 does not find it optimal to induce A2 to make a high
effort if A1 is making a high effort too. Intuitively, since the profits to P1 are a cost to P2 it is clear that if
P1 gets higher profits when both A1 and A2 make high efforts (see Proposition 4) then P2 will have
higher costs in that case. To complete the argument one must demonstrate that these higher marginal
costs outweigh the marginal profit to P2 from the final price net of the marginal contracting cost of
inducing high effort from A2. While this is done formally in the proof of Proposition 5 the logic behind it
is that the input price gives P1 “too much” of the surplus from the added effort of A2.

29

D. Equilibrium
With Propositions 4 and 5 in hand we are ready to find the Nash equilibrium of the economy.
Recall that an equilibrium is: (1) a set of contracts designed by the principals to maximize their respective
expected utilities; (2) effort choices by each agent such that their expected utilities are maximized given
the contracts; and (3) correct beliefs, held by each player, regarding the choices of the other players.
Intuitively, Proposition 4 says that P1 will only induce a high effort if the chance that P2 induces a high
effort is sufficiently high. Similarly, Proposition 5 says that P2 will induce a high effort from her agent as
long as the probability that P1 will also do so is low. For this reason we get the following mixed strategy
equilibrium.
Proposition 6: The Nash Equilibrium is given by the contracts specified in Propositions 4 and 5 and by
the following beliefs, q* and b* :
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε q * =

∆Φ
1
and b * =
.
∆P
2 − ε + ∆Φ

ii. For ∆Φ > ε q * = 1 and b * = 0 .
Proof: To find an equilibrium we first need to demonstrate that it is optimal for agents to agree on a price
and trade. Then we need to find the optimal contracts written by principals to maximize their profits, the
optimal effort choices made by the agents to maximize their utility and, finally, beliefs that are consistent
with the actual actions taken. We first show that it is indeed optimal for agents to agree on a price and
trade the input good. Assume, by contradiction, that the agents bargain as specified by the mechanism,
but that one agent decides to break off negotiations. Since it is too costly for each agent to search for a
different counterparty, each agent goes back to his principal, reports that the negotiations broke down, and
asks for his compensation. Since each principal has limited liability, the only way she can pay her agent
is if trade takes place. Thus, the limited liability of the principals binds and the agents get nothing.
Knowing that the principals can credibly claim they have limited liability when no trade occurs, agents
will never find it in their interest to permanently disagree on a price at which to trade. Thus, in the
market, agents always agree on a price according to the specified mechanism. The rest of the proof is left
to Appendix A.
Integration is not the dominant organizational form, as in the previous cases. Now, the input
price is serving an important allocative role because it supplies some ‘free’ information to principals.

30

Recall that the only information the principals need, in order to eliminate the agency costs (of not being
able to contract directly on the agents’ investment decision), is whether the state is HL or LH. The takeit-or-leave-it offer game means that the non-manipulation constraints only need to be enforced by each
principal half of the time. The other half of the time, the other principal is enforcing the nonmanipulation constraint. Each principal is, thus, supplying some information to his counterpart at no cost.
To see this recall that P is the price that A2 is willing to pay A1 when A2 is uninformed and A1
gets to make the take-it-or-leave-it offer. Since A2 cannot distinguish between the states HL and LL, P
is paid in both states. The price P is the observed price because P2 enforces the non-manipulation
constraint imposed on A2. But, this benefits P1. Observing P , P1 learns that A2 made a low effort and
this information, combined with the final price allows him to distinguish HL from LL and hence learn the
effort choice of A1. P1 did not pay for this information. Similarly, P is the price that A1 offers A2
when A2 is uninformed and A1 gets to make the take-it-or-leave it offer. This price is paid because P1
enforces the non-manipulation constraint imposed on A1. Again, observing P , P2 knows that A2 did not
make a high effort. P2 learns this information because P1 paid to enforce the non-manipulation constraint
on A1.
The introduction of the take-it-or-leave-it offer game allows the two principals to coordinate to
share the burden of producing information and, consequently, to reduce the cost of information
production. The price now contains information that is not paid for completely by each party. This is the
source of its value.
While the intermediate input price is valuable, there is a cost to organizing production in two
firms. Notice from Proposition 6 that, while the equilibrium q* and b* depend on exogenous parameter
values, for all parameter values the equilibrium does not result in First Best effort levels. Under our
assumptions, an unconstrained social planner would choose q* = b* = 1 , i.e., high effort levels would
always be induced. The equilibrium, however, is not First Best for two interrelated reasons. First, there
is a coordination failure in that P1 and P2 cannot meet and commit to induce high effort levels from their
agents. We say that P1 does not have the authority to write A2’s compensation contract because A2 has
been hired by P2. The coordination failure matters because, second, when A1 makes a high effort choice,
P2 does not want to induce high effort from A2. This is a result of the price formation mechanism.
The input price is a valuable signal because it supplies information useful for contracting, but the
market does not allow principals to coordinate since each principal only has the authority to contract with
his own agent. Thus, the trade-off determining organizational form is between the value of information

31

from prices when there is a market versus the authority to coordinate when the market is closed via
Integration.
VI.

The Efficiency of the Visible versus the Invisible Hand
Having identified the trade-off between the two organizational forms, we now consider the choice

of organizational form: Integration versus Non-Integration. We analyze which form is socially efficient,
which form the principals privately prefer and, finally, which form is privately preferred by the agents.
The choice of whether to vertically integrate will depend on balancing the informational gains resulting
from having the market for the intermediate good against the costs of principals not having the authority
to coordinate contracts in this case.
We consider constrained social efficiency, that is, the socially efficient organizational form
chosen by a social planner. This corresponds to the organizational choice that results in the largest total
surplus. Namely, we look for the organizational form that maximizes the combined surplus of both the
two agents and the two principals. The following proposition gives a summary of the socially efficient
structure for the different parameter values of the model.
Proposition 7 (Constrained Social Efficiency): The constrained socially efficient organizational form
is:
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε :

The efficient organizational form is Integration.

ii. For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 : Both Integration and Non-Integration have the same level of efficiency.
iii. For 1 < ∆Φ :

The efficient organizational form is Non-Integration.

Proof: See Appendix A.
To understand the proposition recall that in the Non-Integration case, the first-best outcome is never
achieved, i.e., q* and b* are never both equal to one (see Proposition 6). However, with two firms it is
also the case that q* and b* are never both equal to zero. P1 wants to induce a high effort choice only if
she believes that the chance of P2 making a high effort is sufficiently high. But, if P2 believes that there
is a good chance that P1 will induce a high effort from A1, then P2 does not want to induce a high effort
from A2. This is the logic of the mixed strategy equilibrium discussed above. The integrated
organizational form is different in that both q* and b* may be equal to one, or both may be zero, because
a single principal chooses both contracts. Therefore, since the equilibrium q* and b* determine social
efficiency, the socially efficient outcome depends on whether, in the case of Integration, the principal
chooses contracts resulting in q*=b*=1 or q*=b*=0.

32

From Lemma 5 it is clear that, in the case of Integration, the marginal cost of inducing an
additional agent to make a high effort is 2 ∆Φ . The marginal benefit is PHL − PLL = 1 + ∆Φ for the first
agent and PHH − PHL = ε + ∆Φ for the second agent. Since the principal is the one who makes the
choice of contracts, she simply compares the marginal costs and benefits. Therefore, when ∆Φ is greater
than 1 she chooses to induce low efforts from both agents, which results in the lowest efficiency level.
Hence Non-Integration is more efficient. When ∆Φ is less than ε she chooses to induce high effort
from both agents, which is first best. Hence Integration is more efficient. Finally, when ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1
neither organizational form achieves first best. In the case of Integration the principal chooses to induce
high effort from only one agent. With Non-Integration, q*=1 while b*=0 so the result is the same,
namely, only one agent makes a high effort choice. Clearly, the social efficiency of the two forms is then
the same.
Privately, principals and agents view the trade-off between the informational properties of the
market for the intermediate good against the authority to coordinate differently than the social planner.
Thus, the choice of organization is not necessarily the same.
Proposition 8 (Principals): When principals choose the optimal organizational form their choices are
given by:
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε : ∃ε * such that for ∆Φ ≤ ε * principals choose Integration and for ∆Φ > ε * they
choose Non-Integration.
ii.For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 : Principals are indifferent between Integration and Non-Integration.
iii.For 1 < ∆Φ : Principals choose Integration.
Proof: See Appendix A.
Figure 2 illustrates the benefits of each organizational form to the principals. The figure plots the
profits to the principals as a function of the marginal cost of effort for each of the two organizational
forms of production. In the Figure we assume that A = 5 and that ε =0.8 . With Integration the principal
gets control over the contracts of both agents but she loses the information revealed in the intermediate
input price. Authority over the contracts is most valuable in the two extreme cases when the marginal
cost of inducing effort, ∆Φ , is very high or very low. When ∆Φ is very low the principal uses her
authority to induce both agents to make a high effort. On the other hand when ∆Φ is very high she uses
her authority to induce low effort from both since this is optimal for her. In the intermediate case, when

33

∆Φ is not too high and not too low, the cost of losing the intermediate input price dominates that of
having authority.
Agents’ organizational choices are given by:
Proposition 9 (Agents): When agents choose the optimal organizational form their choices are given by:
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε :

Agents choose Integration.

ii. For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 : Agents are indifferent between Integration and Non-Integration.
iii. For 1 < ∆Φ :

Agents choose Non-Integration.

Proof: See Appendix A.
Proposition 9 says that agents always make the socially efficient organizational choice while, from
Proposition 8, we saw that principals do not always make the socially efficient decision. In particular,
when the principal controlling the single firm chooses not to induce either agent to make a high effort,
agents are clearly better off with Non-Integration. With two firms, agents can use the contract externality
to extract some surplus from principals, so they are better off. The social planner prefers this
organizational form because some high effort is induced in the mixed strategy equilibrium.
Propositions 7, 8, and 9 raise the issue of whether it is principals or agents who make the
organizational form decision. Depending on who has that decision-making power, there may be mergers
that increase shareholder value (when principal/shareholders get the power to make the decision) or
mergers that decrease shareholders value but increase efficiency (when agent/managers have control).
For example, in the case where ε * ≤ ∆Φ ≤ ε , agents choose Integration whereas principals choose NonIntegration. Note that while a merger here will lead to a loss to shareholders, it still increases efficiency.
The notion of efficiency we have in mind is not that of shareholder wealth but rather of the combined
wealth of shareholders and the agent. The agent can be thought of as all the employees of the company.
VII.

Transfer Prices, Market Prices, and Property Rights
When there is a single firm, Integration, the first agent, A1, transfers the intermediate input good

to the second agent, A2, inside the firm. There is no “market” or associated “price” because there is no
transfer of ownership. Nevertheless, there could be a number(s) called a ‘transfer price(s)” that is
associated with transfer of the good from A1 to A2 inside the firm.18 In other words, the principal could
ask the agents to send signals or reports to her about the quality of the input good. So far, we have not
considered the possibility that such “transfer prices” could replicate the information content of the

34

intermediate market prices. To understand the difference between the organizational forms, it is
important to ask what is special about information produced in the market as compared to information
produced internally.
The information that the principal wants to obtain regards whether the true state is HL or LH.
Since the principal would use this information to reduce the cost of contracting, agents will not want to
replicate this information. Consequently, the principal will have to `force' agents to report these states by
enforcing constraints. The main issue concerns whether the principal can credibly force agents to
replicate the market price internally without paying them to do so. A transfer price can replicate the
market input price only if the principal does not have to pay for all of the information about the states HL
and LH.
The principal sees the final price, but this price does not differentiate between states HL and LH.
She needs more information. Imagine the following mechanism. Suppose the single principal controlling
the firm requires agents to “agree on a price” before A1 gives the input good to A2. Each agent has to
report one of the four input prices corresponding to the four quality states (the exact numbers do not
matter as long they are distinct and it is understood how they correspond to the quality states). We
assume that:
Assumption 8: Agents cannot make side payments to each other when they work in the same firm.
Assumption 8 simply guarantees that agents do not make side deals to manipulate prices (which would
simply increase the cost of obtaining information from them) or agree to report some new numbers that
are not in the schedule.
Compensation for each agent is based on the following contract. If the principal gets two
different reports then she does not want trade to occur and each agent gets nothing (here the limited
liability of the principal binds because there is no production). If, however, agents report the same price
then their compensation will be according to the reported efforts. With these price reports, there are two
ways that the principal can obtain information from the agents. First, she can threaten the agents with low
compensation payments if they report different signals. Or, secondly, she can offer them high
compensation if their signals coincide and hence are informative (since they cannot make side deals to
manipulate the signal).
Consider the first possibility of threatening low compensation for contradictory price reports.
Since agents have limited liability it is infeasible to threaten them with low pay unless it is the case that
18

There is a large literature on transfer prices. See, for example, Abdel-khalik, and Lusk (1974), Eccles (1985),
Eccles and White (1988), Gould (1964), Hass (1968), Hirshleifer (1956), and Holmstrom and Tirole (1991).

35

the principal's limited liability constraint binds too (namely, if she too has no money). The principal will,
in fact, have no money if production does not place. But, a contract under which the principal instructs
agents to cease production if their price reports differ is not re-negotiation-proof. If agents disagree on a
price and report this to the principal it is never in her interest to follow up on the threat that they should
not trade. In this case the principal, who owns both the input good and the final output, has two options.
She can either go along with the original contract specifying no trade, in which case she gets nothing or,
alternatively, she can renege on the agents’ contract and instruct the agents to proceed to produce the final
good, thereby getting a strictly positive profit. Clearly, she will prefer that the agents “trade” and
complete production. Knowing this, agents will never agree to report an informative signal since this will
reduce their expected compensation.
Now, consider the second possibility, that of offering agents bonuses to induce them to report the
true state. This means that each agent i‘s contract has to be such that Wi ( PFinal , K ) ≥ Wi ( PFinal ) , where
K is the reported true state (input price). But, then the contracting cost to the principal cannot be reduced
by having agents report an input price so that transfer prices within the firm do not reduce the cost of
inducing effort and cannot replicate the input market price.
Thus, we have shown:
Proposition 10: When the input market is internalized into a single firm by one principal hiring both
agents and owning all the assets used for production, the principal cannot increase her profits by
inducing the agents to report an informative signal (namely, the true state).
The logic of the proposition relies heavily on the notion of limited liability for the principal or,
equivalently (as discussed in the Introduction) on the idea of “incorporation.” And this, in turn, is linked
to whether property rights are being transferred in conjunction with reporting a signal or negotiating a
price. In the input market, there is competition between the two principals: P1 wants a high input price
while P2 wants a low input price. Transfer of property rights to the input only occurs when a bargain is
struck and a price is reported. Agents behave strategically, and form a price, because if they do not they
are not compensated because principals are incorporated as “firms” (with limited liability). Thus, agents
are somewhat schizophrenic. On the one hand, principal-agent pairs are competing, that is, the agents
want to strike a bargain with their counterpart. But, on the other hand, each agent is also competing with
his own principal because each agent would also like the bargain with the other agent to extract as much
as possible from his respective principal.
Inside the firm, while agents cannot explicitly coordinate (by Assumption 8), it is never in their
interests to report an informative price because it then allows the principal to lower the cost of

36

contracting. Agents understand this clearly and there is no countervailing force since principal-agent
pairs are not competing. Why is there no countervailing force? The answer is that property rights to the
input good are not being transferred inside the firm so the limited liability constraint of the principal is not
credible in forcing agents to compete with each other. Since agents understand that inside the firm
property rights to the input do not get transferred, they know that not agreeing on a transfer price will not
affect production. Hence they do not report a transfer price. In the market, because of the competition
between the two firms, agents have to agree on a price even though it reveals information about their
marginal efforts. They understand that agreeing on a price is necessary for transferring property rights.
VIII.

Discussion
To explain General Motors, a theory of the firm should incorporate (so to speak) the essential

features of the modern corporation. These features include: (1) limited liability, that is, the corporation is
a separate legal entity; (2) the separation of ownership and control, that is, those running the firm are
distinct from those who own residual cash flow and control rights; and (3), asset ownership, that is, the
owners (principals) have residual rights of control over the firm’s assets. In this paper we develop a
theory in which all three features play critical roles. The theory shows that a defining feature of the
corporation is the substitution of authority for informative market prices. The visible hand is sometimes
more valuable than the invisible hand.
We start from an agency relationship in which a principal hires an agent. In our model this means
that the principal controls the contract of the agent, has ownership rights to the output produced by the
agent, and also that the principal has limited liability and hence that this “firm” is a separate legal entity.
Given this basic building block we ask the question that is at the heart of any theory of the firm: What is
the basic tradeoff between organizing economic activity via external markets and organizing the activity
internally, within the boundaries of the firm? We show that the combination of the principals having
limited liability and having ownership rights results in internal transfer prices that are uninformative and
external prices that are informative to shareholders. We find that the authority the principal has over the
agents’ contracts also has economic value. Thus, based on the three characteristics of the modern
corporation identified above, a natural tension arises between the value of having authority to coordinate
activity within a firm and the value of having informative market prices outside the firm.
How then is the corporation distinguishable from the market? In other words, why can’t the
information in market prices be replicated internally with transfer prices? The answer we provide is
intuitive. In order to facilitate production, agents need to trade with each other. However, trading at a
negotiated price reveals information to their respective principals regarding their marginal efforts and
hence reduces their agency rents. Why then do they go ahead and agree on a price when they are in

37

separate firms, but they do not agree when they are in the same firm? When production is organized in
separate firms, agents understand that they will not be compensated unless there is profit. Profit requires
trade and trade requires them to agree on a price. Hence, they are forced to reveal some information.
Limited liability plays a key role. Since principals have limited liability they cannot be forced to
compensate agents when there is no trade.

can solve the maximization problem assuming that λ1 = 0 and then show that at the optimum the

Further, from the second equation we see that this leads to λ 2 = q . For q = 0 clearly the contracts we

then follows.
Proof of Lemma 3: The proof of this Lemma is exactly the same as the proof of Lemma 1. For that
reason we omit it.
Proof of Lemma 5: At the optimum WLL = Φ L . We next prove that both of the incentive compatibility
constraints (IC) must bind. Assume to the contrary that they do not; say that the IC constraint for A1 does
not bind, then substituting WLL = Φ L into IC we have: bWHH + (1 − 2b)WHL > Φ H − bΦ L with a strict
inequality. By limited liability WHH and WHL must be at least Φ H . The inequality can then be true only
if both WHH = Φ H and WHL = Φ H . Otherwise we can reduce one of the payments without violating any
of the constraints and thereby increase the objective function. But if this is the case then the left-hand
side must equal (1 − b)Φ H which is less than Φ H − bΦ L . This violates the IC. A similar argument can
be made to show that the second IC constraint binds. Thus both the IC constraints have to bind. Given
that the IC constraints bind we will prove that WHL = Φ H . Assume, to the contrary, that WHL = Φ H + δ

39

where δ > 0 . The objective function is then: − qb(

2b − 1
δ ) + ( q + b − 2qb)( −δ ) = −bδ < 0 . Since
b

this is negative we get that at the optimum WHL = Φ H . The equilibrium contracts are then

WHH = Φ H + ∆Φ and WHL = Φ H .
Proof of Lemma 6: First it is easy to see that WLLP = Φ L . Second, as is well known in these type of
H
problems, we can solve assuming the first constraint WHH
≥ Φ H does not bind and then show that the

solution satisfies this assumption. Denoting the LaGrange multipliers by λi for constraint i = 2...6 we
get the following first order conditions:

Φ H + q∆Φ those contracts will be optimal. It is easy to verify that the contracts specified in Lemma 10
satisfy this condition.

. When ∆Φ > ε , the condition on q is never

satisfied (i.e., q>1) so that P1 always induces low effort. This means that b* = 0 . This in turn means
that the condition for P2 to induce high effort is always satisfied which means that q * = 1 .
Proof of Proposition 7: In the case of Non-Integration the total expected surplus is given by:

q * b * ( PHH − 2Φ H ) + [q * (1 − b*) + b * (1 − q*)]( PHL − Φ H − Φ L ) + (1 − q*)(1 − b*)( PLL − 2Φ L ) . For
∆Φ ≤ ε , q* and b* are less than 1 and their values are given in Proposition 6. For ∆Φ > ε , q*=1 and
b*=0. Comparing this to the surplus in the case of Integration we see that for ∆Φ ≤ ε , Integration
achieves first best, i.e., q*=b*=1 and a surplus of PHH − 2Φ H , so this is the efficient structure. For

ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 , with Non-Integration, the expected surplus is A+1, which is equal to the output in the case

41

of Integration ( PHL − Φ H − Φ L = A + 1 ). Thus the efficiency of both economies is the same. Finally, for

∆Φ > 1 with Integration the principal induces low effort from both agents, which results in a surplus of
PLL − 2Φ L = A . This is less than A + 1 so here Non-Integration dominates.
Proof of Proposition 8: With Integration the principal gets:
i.

A when ∆Φ ≥ 1 .

ii.

A + (1 − ∆Φ ) when ε ≤ ∆Φ < 1 .

iii.

A + (1 − ∆Φ ) + (ε − ∆Φ ) when ∆Φ ≤ ε .

With Non-Integration the expected surplus of P1 and P2 can be calculated by subtracting the agents’
compensation from the total expected output. This yields an expected surplus of:
3Φ H + Φ L
3
q *b * ( PHH − 2Φ H − ∆Φ ) + (1 − q * )b * ( PHL −

2
2
For ∆Φ ≤ ε , q * =

∆Φ
1
and b* =
while for ∆Φ > ε , q*=1 and b*=0. Calculating the
∆Ρ
2 + ∆Φ − ε

profits and comparing them to the principals’ profits under Integration gives the following:
For ∆Φ > 1 , Integration is better since PHL − 2Φ H = A + 1 − ∆Φ is less than A. Here the ability of the
principal to choose q*=b*=0 dominates. For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 , under both economies the principals get a
surplus of A + (1 − ∆Φ ) so they are indifferent. Finally, when ∆Φ ≤ ε , the principal gets

A + (1 − ∆Φ ) + (ε − ∆Φ ) in Integration by inducing both agents to make a high effort. This needs be
compared to (A2) above. Substituting in the values of q* and b* we get that (A2) equals

− 4∆Φ 3 + (−5 + 4ε )∆Φ 2 + (6 − ε )∆Φ + 2ε
. The condition for choosing Non-Integration over
2(ε + ∆Φ)(2 − ε + ∆Φ)
Integration then translates into:

− 4∆Φ 3 + (−5 + 4ε )∆Φ 2 + (6 − ε )∆Φ + 2ε
− (1 + ε ) + 2∆Φ ≥ 0 .
2(ε + ∆Φ)(2 − ε + ∆Φ)

One can see that as ∆Φ ⇓ 0 the expression becomes negative which means that Integration is preferred.
However as ∆Φ ⇑ ε the expression becomes positive which means that Non-Integration is better for the
principals.

Proof of Proposition 9: The agents’ expected compensation net of their cost of effort under the NonIntegration structure is:

for ∆Φ ≤ ε (which simplifies to: ∆Φ ( q + ) ) and ∆Φ for ∆Φ > ε . Under Integration agents get a

net expected value of: 2 ∆Φ for ∆Φ ≤ ε , ∆Φ for ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 and 0 for 1 ≤ ∆Φ . These values are
derived by subtracting the private cost of effort from the optimal contracts. Using the above we compare
the two organizational forms (from the agents’ perspective) to get the proposition.

Appendix B
Proposition B1 The equilibrium q * and b * are given by,
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε :

q * = b* = 1 .

ii. For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 : q * = b * =
iii. For 1 < ∆Φ :

1 − ∆Φ *
; q = 0, b * = 1 ; q * = 1, b * = 0.
1− ε

q * = b* = 0 .

Proof of Proposition B1: We first calculate the profits to P1 and P2 from inducing their agents to make a
high effort and then calculate their profits from inducing a low effort from their agents (both under the
optimal contracts found in Lemmas 1-4). These calculations lead to the following two conditions:
(1) P1 will induce her agent to make a high effort if and only if q ≤

1 − ∆Φ
.
1− ε

(2) P2 will induce her agent to make a high effort if and only if b ≤

1 − ∆Φ
.
1− ε

Consequently, the Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies is:
i. For ∆Φ ≤ ε :

q * = b* = 1 .
1 − ∆Φ *
ii. For ε < ∆Φ ≤ 1 : q * = b * =
; q = 0, b * = 1 ; q * = 1, b * = 0. .
1− ε
q* = b* = 0 .
iii. For 1 < ∆Φ :
Proposition B2: To calculate the equilibrium q and b we first need to find the profit for each principal
(P1 and P2) from inducing their agent to make a high effort and a low effort. Since Lemma's 6-9 give us
the optimal contracts in these cases it is a simple algebraic exercise to derive the following conditions for
when P1 and P2 will induce their respective agents to make a high effort choice:

q(ε + ∆Φ − 2 z ) ≥ ∆Φ − z

b≤

(b1)

2z − 2
ε − ∆Φ − 2

(b2)

where z ≡ PM − P .
Given these two conditions for P1 (b1) and P2 (b2), depending on the relation between the parameters

z , ε , and ∆Φ , the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium q * and b * can be found.

Appendix C
When P1 can only write contracts on the intermediate input price we have the following:
Proposition C1: P1 writes a contract that induces high effort if and only if:

For ∆Φ ≤ ε q * =

ii.

For ∆Φ > ε q * = 1 and b* = 0 .

The proofs of these propositions are similar to the proofs of the propositions in the main text and are
therefore omitted. From the above three propositions one can verify that:

q* =

∆Φ
∆Φ 2 ∆Φ

so that this equilibrium is (weakly) more efficient than the one studied in the main text where the contract
of A1 was also contingent on the final output price.
