Does Mandating Social Insurance Affect Entrepreneurial Activity?

ABSTRACT
This paper estimates the effect of relaxing the social insurance mandate on entrepreneurial
activity. We use a unique discontinuity in Finland that allows certain entrepreneurs not to pay
social insurance contributions on their income. Using rich administrative data, we find that
relaxing the social insurance mandate leads entrepreneurs to significantly reduce their
contributions, which they channel instead into their firms. While young firms use this windfall to
increase business activity, older ones use it to improve their net lending position by purchasing
stocks. Our results imply that the social insurance mandate is binding and its efficiency cost is
heterogeneous.

Introduction

Dubbed “the engine of growth”, entrepreneurship plays a central role in modern economies. In the US, for example, new businesses account for 20% of
total gross job creation.1 While entrepreneurs can be very successful and
accumulate massive amounts of wealth, entrepreneurship remains one of the
most economically risky lines of activity and can result in large wealth losses.2
For this reason, mandating social insurance for this population can prove to
be a first-order welfare improvement: without insurance, entrepreneurs face
substantial old-age, disability and sickness risk. However, the marginal value
of resources for entrepreneurs can be substantial, given how cash-constrained
they often are. Therefore, mandating social insurance, while reducing risks,
could significantly affect entrepreneurial activity.
In this paper, we offer novel causal evidence on the effects of relaxing the
social insurance mandate on entrepreneurs and their business activity.3 We
exploit quasi-experimental variation in the amount of social insurance contributions and rich firm- and individual-level administrative data on the full
population of Finnish entrepreneurs to address this question. While social
insurance contribution rates are the same across all entrepreneurs in Finland,
the base over which the rate applies is not. Once entrepreneurs own more
than a certain share of their firm, 30% currently and 50% in earlier years,
they have a lot more discretion over how much social insurance contributions
to pay, irrespective of their compensation.4 In contrast, below this ownership
share threshold, entrepreneurs cannot choose their contribution rates, as their
contributions are directly based on their earned income.

See, for example, Decker et al. [2014].
This argument is articulated, for example, in Hall and Woodward [2010].
3
Hereafter we use the term “entrepreneur” to refer to the owners of privately held corporations, which are the focus of this paper. We use this definition as the social insurance
system only applies to entrepreneurs who actively work for their firm. Therefore, we believe
that entrepreneur is a suitable term to describe the group of business owners that we are
studying.

In the US, owners of S corporations can reduce their social security contributions by
reducing their compensation and opting for dividends instead.

We use a standard differences-in-differences strategy and exploit a reform
in 2011 that changed the ownership share rule from 50% to 30% to assess
how relaxing the social insurance mandate affects entrepreneurial activity. We
compare firm owners with 30 to 50% pre-reform ownership shares (treatment)
to firm owners with 51 to 70% pre-reform ownership shares (control). Importantly, our empirical analysis shows that entrepreneurs have not manipulated
their ownership shares as a response to the reform, which would otherwise
invalidate our research design.
Overall, we find that social insurance contributions are reduced by an average of 19% for the treatment group, which has more discretion over insurance
contributions after the reform. This reduction represents a large cash windfall, equivalent to, on average, a 5 percentage-point reduction in corporate
taxes. This variation is substantial, approximately five times larger than the
average corporate tax rate changes used by Fuest et al. [2018] to estimate the
incidence of corporate taxes, and three times larger than the variation used
in Chetty et al. [2014] to estimate the crowd-out effect of subsidized pension
plans. When we consider all firms together, we estimate that the effects of
relaxing the social insurance mandate on business activity are limited, as we
observe no significant responses in the main firm outcomes, such as turnover,
investments or input costs.
However, this average analysis masks important heterogeneity by firm age.
Following the entrepreneurship definition of Decker et al. [2014], who define
entrepreneurs as firms that are younger than 5 years of age, we break down
our sample of firms into young and older firms. As the social insurance mandate is relaxed, we observe a larger than average decrease in social insurance
contributions by the owners of younger firms. The cash saved from the lower
contributions is channeled into their firms, as we observe an increase in both
employee compensations and other input costs, and an increase in turnover after the reform. We also observe that owners of older firms reduce their social
insurance contributions, albeit by a significantly smaller amount, and channel
the additional cash into their firms. However, instead of using this cash windfall to boost business activity, as young firms do, they use it to increase the net
2

lending position of the firm by increasing long-term investments in the form of
stock holdings. As a consequence, the social insurance mandate has no effect
on the business activity of older firms: we observe no changes in turnover or
input use in response to the decrease in contributions for older firms. This
differential response for the owners of young versus older firms suggests that
entrepreneurs in younger firms are more liquidity-constrained and have access
to better growth opportunities than more mature firms.
These findings imply that the efficiency cost of mandating social insurance
for firm owners is very different for young versus older firms since the social
insurance mandate affects them very differently. While virtually all countries
in the OECD mandate that wage earners contribute to some form of oldage, disability and sickness insurance program, there is wide variation in the
treatment of non-wage earners, including entrepreneurs. The OECD countries address the issue of insuring non-wage earners in three different ways:
(1) 73% of countries do not differentiate between wage and non-wage earners, and mandate the participation of non-wage earners to the regular social
insurance program. The remaining 27% either (2) mandate that non-wage
earners participate in a special social insurance program specifically designed
for them (15%) or (3) allow non-wage earners to opt into the regular social
insurance program, with no specific mandate (12%).5 This variation in the
coverage of non-wage earners begs the question of which approach is better
suited to insuring non-wage earners. While fully addressing the question of
the optimal design of social insurance for entrepreneurs is beyond the scope
of this paper, as it also requires estimating the benefit of social insurance, we
make progress on this question by focusing on the efficiency cost of mandating
social insurance on the business activity of entrepreneurs.
There is limited evidence of the effects of mandating social insurance on
entrepreneurship, and we believe that this is the first paper to shed light on this
question. However, our paper is also tangentially related to the following three
literatures. The first literature estimates the crowd-out effect of subsidized
5

Association.

pension contributions on savings. Chetty et al. [2014] show, using a compelling
quasi-experimental setting in Denmark, that pension contributions tend not
to crowd out other savings for wage earners when individuals are defaulted
into increasing their savings.6 Our paper complements the analysis of Chetty
et al. [2014] by focusing on a population of active savers, i.e. individuals who
actively decide their level of contributions, and provides an answer to what
outcomes are crowded out by subsidized pension savings for entrepreneurs.
Second, our paper is related to a literature that estimates the effect of
regulation on entrepreneurial activity. This literature has mostly focused on
the role of entry regulation on entrepreneurship. For example, Djankov et al.
[2002] and Klapper et al. [2006] show that entry regulations are likely to reduce
firm entry. More recently, Harju et al. [2019], Tazhitdinova [2016] and Aghion
et al. [2017] estimate the effect of the hassle costs of complying with the tax
code on entrepreneurs and incorporation. We focus on a different type of
regulation – the social insurance mandate – and its effect on the intensive
entrepreneurial margin.
Third, this paper is related to corporate finance and public finance literatures that estimate the effect of taxes on entrepreneurial activity. This is a
central question as it matters for both tax policy and economic growth.7 For
example, Cullen and Gordon [2007] use time series variation in tax rates to
estimate the effect of taxes on risk-taking by entrepreneurs, and Gentry and
Hubbard [2000] use a discrete-choice model to estimate the effect of tax progressivity on entrepreneurial entry. The remaining research has mostly focused
on cross-country comparisons of the level of taxes and entrepreneurial activity
and found negative correlations between these two variables.8
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutions and
the data we use. Section 3 presents our estimation strategy and the descriptive

Institutional Background and Data

2.1

The Finnish Social Insurance System

The Finnish social insurance system is funded by government-mandated contributions. The system includes pension contributions paid by both employees
and employers, and health and unemployment insurance contributions paid by
wage earners based on their earnings and predetermined contribution rates. In
addition to earnings-related insurance benefits, there are regulated minimum
guarantee pensions and sickness and unemployment allowances for those with
no or very small earnings and short work histories. Overall, the mandatory insurance system covers the vast majority of pension, health and unemployment
benefits in Finland, as there is only limited private provision of insurance.

2.2

Social Insurance Contributions of Entrepreneurs

Finland has a special social insurance scheme for entrepreneurs, called the
Self-employed Persons’ Pension Act, referred to as YEL.9 The YEL insurance
scheme applies to all self-employed individuals and excludes wage earners. In
addition, to qualify for YEL, self-employed individuals must meet the following
conditions: they have to be 18 to 67 years old, their firm must be at least four
months old, and the income they derive from the firm has to be at least 7,557
euros per year (in 2016).10
The YEL insurance scheme also applies to all partners of partnership firms
and to owners of privately held corporations who own, alone or together with
family members, at least 50% of their firm. In addition, owners who hold a
leading position in a privately held corporation (such as CEO or chairman
9

YEL stands for “Yrittäjän eläkelaki” in Finnish.
The Self-employed Persons’ Pension Act (HE 1272/2006) is available online here (in
Finnish): https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2006/20061272. More information in English can be found here: https://www.ilmarinen.fi/en/self-employed-person/self-employedpersons-pension-insurance/yel-contributions.

of the board) and own over 30% of the company’s shares are considered to
be YEL entrepreneurs. The above conditions are binding, and entrepreneurs
cannot opt out of the YEL insurance scheme.
If the above conditions are not met, entrepreneurs are automatically subject to the TyEL insurance scheme, which is the same insurance program as
for wage earners. Hereafter, we refer to all entrepreneurs to which YEL rules
are applied as Y owners, and all other entrepreneurs who do not fulfill these
requirements as T owners.
The main difference between Y and T owners is that T owners pay a set contribution rate on the income they earn from their firm, with no discretion over
contribution levels, while Y owners can freely set the base over which the social
insurance contribution rate applies as long as it falls between two bounds. In
2016, these bounds were 7,557 and 171,625 euros, respectively. Therefore, Y
owners have significantly more discretion over their level of mandatory social
insurance contributions. The contributions of T owners, on the other hand, are
set automatically via a formula defined by a function of their earned income
and the contribution rate.11
Future benefit entitlements are tied to contribution levels, and therefore,
by reducing their contributions, Y owners are entitled to lower benefits. Note
also that social insurance benefits are subsidized in Finland, implying that
contributions are more than actuarially fair.12 In addition, insurance contributions can be deducted from income taxes. Otherwise, the insurance status
of an entrepreneur does not affect income taxation in any way, i.e. there is no
difference in income taxation between Y and T owners.
11

Both the YEL and TyEL contribution rates, and the minimum and maximum YEL
income levels vary slightly over time and are usually determined annually. The contribution
rates also vary by age, and are higher for older individuals. In 2016, the TyEL rate is 25.2%
for persons aged 53 or older, and the YEL contribution rate is 25.1% for persons aged 53 to
62. In addition, the contribution rates are lower for starting businesses of Y owners: 19.6%
for persons aged 53 to 62, and 18.4% for others.
12
In addition to pensions, the level of insurance contributions directly affects other social
insurance benefits provided by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland in a similar way.
These mainly include sickness and parental allowances, and unemployment benefits.

6

Ownership share threshold and the 2011 reform. In this paper, we
focus on the owners of privately held corporations. The reason for this restriction is that these entrepreneurs faced an exogenous change in insurance
contribution rules which we use in our empirical analysis. Before 2011, the
owners of privately held corporations with an active role in their firm and
owning over 50% of the company shares were treated as Y owners, i.e., they
had more freedom to choose their level of insurance contributions. In 2011,
this threshold was decreased to the current level of 30%. This meant that from
2011 onwards, owners with a 31-50% ownership share could now more freely
determine their level of social insurance contributions. We use this variation,
along with a difference-in-difference strategy discussed in Section 3 below, to
uncover the effects of mandating social insurance on the economic activity
of entrepreneurs.13 Note that, in principle, T owners with ownership shares
above 30% after the reform could opt out of switching to Y owners for 3 years.
However, empirically, we observe that all of the switches from T to Y status
occur at the time of the reform. Apart from this reform, there were no other
notable changes to the social insurance program during the time period we
analyze.

2.3

Data

We use two data sets: (1) data from the two largest Finnish pension companies managing the mandatory social insurance contributions of entrepreneurs,
and (2) corporate tax and individual tax return data covering both firm and
individual-level outcomes and characteristics. We use unique identifiers to link
these data sets together. We describe the data in more detail below.
Insurance Contribution Data. Contribution levels for T owners can be
calculated using our dataset, since they have no discretion over how much
to contribute (the contribution level depends directly on their earned income
and the contribution rate). Since contributions are not directly observable in

tax data, and since Y owners have discretion over their level of contributions,
the only available source of contribution data for these entrepreneurs is the
pension companies that manage the public insurance system in Finland. We
were able to access individual-level contribution data from the two largest
Finnish pension companies, which cover 70% of all entrepreneurs. This data
is available from 2006 to 2014.
Tax Return Data. We use tax return data covering the full population of
individuals and firms, extracted from the Finnish Tax Administration database.
The data include information on the financial statements and tax records of
all Finnish businesses and their main owners. Since we only focus on Y and
T owners of privately-held corporations, we exclude all other businesses from
the sample. The data contain information on key measures of economic activity such as turnover, profits, intermediate inputs and employee costs. In
addition, the data contain detailed balance sheet information, including, for
example, various investment categories. In this paper, we mainly focus on the
impact of social insurance contributions on these measures of firm-level economic activity. The owner-level data contain a substantial amount of income
information, including, for example, wages and dividends received from different firms, taxable income and detailed information on capital income from
different sources (for example, dividends from listed firms, investment fund
shares and voluntary pension savings).

Empirical approach

Estimation. In order to estimate the effect of mandating social insurance
on entrepreneurs and their business activity, we use a difference-in-difference
approach where we take advantage of the fact that the ownership share threshold changed due to the 2011 reform. Prior to 2011, entrepreneurs who owned
less than 50% of their firm were considered T owners, and they had no direct
control over their level of mandatory social insurance contributions. In contrast, entrepreneurs who owned more than 50% of their firm were considered
8

Y owners, and they had more freedom to decide their level of social insurance
contributions. In 2011, the threshold changed from 50% to 30%, such that
now only entrepreneurs with ownership shares below 30% were considered T
owners. In other words, the social insurance mandate was significantly relaxed
for entrepreneurs who owned 30% to 50% of their firms. We compare these
entrepreneurs to those who owned 51% to 70% of their firm, thus being subject
to the Y ownership status both before and after the 2011 reform.14
Formally, we estimate the following specification:
Yi,t = α0 + α1 T reati + α2 P ostt + α3 (T reati ∗ P ostt ) + α4 Xi + λt + εi,t (1)
where Y is the outcome variable of interest (in logs), i is a given entrepreneur, and t is time. T reat is a dummy variable equal to 1 for the treated
entrepreneurs, and equal to 0 for the control group. P ost refers to the period
after the reform (from 2011 onward). X includes a set of owner- and firmlevel control variables. The owner-level controls are age, age squared, gender
and ownership share of the firm. The firm-level controls include the number
of employees, municipality dummies for the location of a firm and one-digit
industry dummies. λt are year fixed effects and ε represents the error term.15
Identification. The identifying assumption for the difference-in-difference
design is not random assignment to the treatment and control groups, but
that the treatment (31-50% ownership share) and control (51-70% ownership
share) groups would have behaved similarly in the absence of the 2011 reform.
This is commonly referred to as the parallel trends assumption. We test this
assumption by comparing the evolution of our main outcome variables for the
treatment and control groups prior to the reform. This assumption holds for
all the main outcomes we consider, as shown below in Section 4. The fact that
14

The results are not sensitive to the choice of the 70% upper bound. In Appendix Table
3, we also use an alternative definition for the control group with ownership shares between
51% to 80% prior to the reform. The results are quantitatively and statistically very similar.
15
We also run specification (1) not controlling for firm- and owner-level characteristics.
Whether or not including controls does not have a significant effect on the estimates, see
Appendix Table 4.

9

the outcome variables follow parallel trends prior to the reform and that the
summary statistics are very similar for the treatment and control groups prior
to 2011 (as shown in Table 1) validates our empirical approach and mitigates
the potential concern that the two groups would not be comparable.
Furthermore, a potential threat to identification is that ownership shares
can, in principle, respond to the 2011 reform. Entrepreneurs could manipulate
their ownership shares in order to self select into the Y or T insurance status.
However, we find no empirical evidence supporting this threat. Appendix
Figure 4 shows the changes in ownership shares for owners with more than 50%
ownership shares to less than 50% (first panel), less than 50% ownership shares
to more than 50% (second panel) and less than 30% ownership shares to more
than 30% (third panel) in 2006-2016. Overall, there are no significant changes
across these thresholds over time nor around the 2011 reform. This alleviates
the concern that owners might intentionally manipulate their ownership shares
as a response to the 2011 reform.
Note that, in principle, we could also use a regression discontinuity design
(RDD) instead of a difference-in-differences strategy. However, the following
two reasons make such a design challenging: (1) RDD is very data intensive,
and the number of entrepreneurs just around the ownership share threshold
is not large enough to provide very accurate results, particularly when analyzing responses separately for young and old firms; (2) firms are unevenly
distributed across the ownership share distribution, as there is a large number
of entrepreneurs with certain ownership shares (e.g. 33% and 50% for firms
with three or two owners), posing a challenge in defining the bandwidths in
the RDD approach. Overall, as the treatment and control groups have parallel trends prior to the reform and have very similar pre-reform characteristics,
we believe that the difference-in-differences design provides more robust and
accurate results on the impact of the 2011 reform.
Descriptive Statistics. Table 1 shows the pre-reform descriptive statistics
separately for the treatment and control groups for all firm owners, and separately for younger and older firms. Following the entrepreneurship definition
10

of Decker et al. [2014], who define entrepreneurs as firms that are younger than
5 years of age, we break down our sample of firms into young and older firms
based on this five-year threshold.
Both owner and firm-level characteristics, including e.g. wages, dividends,
firm-level turnover, assets and inputs are very similar across the control and
treatment groups prior to the reform. The only variable that differs across
the control and treatment groups is the level of mandatory pension contributions, which are significantly lower in the control group prior to 2011. This is
consistent with the fact that, for the treated firms, these contributions were
mandatory prior to the 2011 reform, while they were voluntary in the control
group, providing prima facie evidence that the social insurance mandate has
an effect on the level of insurance contributions, which we show causally below.

Results

Social Insurance Contributions. Figure 1 plots the average annual change
in public insurance contributions from 2006 to 2014 for all firms in the upper
panel, and for younger firms in the bottom-left panel and older firms in the
bottom-right panel. First, the pre-reform period clearly supports the parallel
trends assumption, as insurance contributions in both the treatment and control groups evolve very similarly in all three panels prior to 2011. In contrast,
at the time of the 2011 reform, there is a discontinuous decrease in the level
of social insurance contributions in the treatment group. The trends are also
parallel after 2011, suggesting that most of the response to the policy change
occurs in the year of the reform. The corresponding regression estimates, using
specification (1), are reported in column (1) of Table 2. We estimate that, on
average, pension contributions are reduced by 18.9% after the reform (see the
bottom panel of Table 2). The reduction in social insurance contributions is
larger among younger firms, 23.3%, and smaller among older firms, 17.3%.
Overall, the reduction in social insurance contributions results in a large
cash windfall to the entrepreneur, equivalent to a 5 percentage point cut in

11

their corporate tax rate.16 This decrease in contributions is substantial, and
is approximately five times larger than the average corporate tax rate changes
used by Fuest et al. [2018] to estimate the incidence of corporate taxes, and
three times larger than the variation used in Chetty et al. [2014] to estimate
the crowd-out effect of subsidized pension plans. Given the magnitude of this
windfall, one could expect it to affect firm-level outcomes.
Business Activity Outcomes. Figure 2 shows the effect of the 2011 reform
on business activity for young firms that are equal to or younger than five years
old. The figure shows a positive effect on firm turnover, and an increase in
wage costs. However, we find no increase in investments and stock holdings for
these young firms. The corresponding regression estimates are reported in the
first panel of Table 2. These results are consistent with the graphical evidence:
we estimate a 9.9% increase in turnover and a 6% increase in employee wage
costs. Overall, these results imply that firms use the saved cash to pay for
additional intermediate inputs and labor in order to increase turnover, and
suggests that these firms might be facing liquidity constraints.
Figure 3 shows the effects of the reform on the business activity of firms
that are older than five years old. Old firms respond to the reform very differently compared to young firms: turnover, wage costs and investments do not
increase due to the reform, but firm-level stock holdings increase instead. This
suggests that the owners of these firms accumulate firm-level stock holdings
as a response to the decrease in social security contributions. Therefore, the
money saved is used instead to increase the net lending position of the firm
by buying more stocks. The second panel of Table 2 shows the regression estimates which confirm the graphical evidence discussed above: the only variable
that responds to the reform is firm-level stock holdings, which increased by
14.2% as a response to the reform. This implies that the additional windfall
is reinvested by the owners of mature firms, not to increase business activity,
but instead to increase the net lending position of their firm.
16

The corporate tax rate is currently 20% in Finland, but the rate has been reduced
several times in recent years, from 26% to 24.5% in 2012 and from 24.5% to 20% in 2014.

12

When pooling young and old firms together in the bottom panel of Table 2,
we find no effects on business activity measures but do observe an increase in
stock holdings.17 These results reflect more those of older firms because they
cover nearly three quarters of the overall sample. Consequently, the average
responses mask important heterogeneity by firm age.
Overall, our findings imply that the social insurance mandate is binding
for both young and mature firms. However, its efficiency cost varies by the
age of the firm. While it crowds out business activity for young firms, it tends
to depress stock holdings for more mature ones.

Conclusions

This paper estimates the effects of relaxing the social insurance mandate on entrepreneurs. Using quasi-experimental variation and a difference-in-differences
design, we find that entrepreneurs substantially reduce their contributions to
the social insurance program when these contributions are not mandatory, implying that the social insurance mandate is binding for entrepreneurs. The
money saved is channeled into firms differently depending on the age of the
firm. Younger firms tend to use the money to increase their business activity, while more mature firms use it to improve their net lending position by
purchasing stocks. Overall, this implies that the social insurance mandate for
entrepreneurs has heterogeneous efficiency costs.
Efficiency gains could be achieved by designing social insurance schemes
that set lower social insurance contributions for younger firms. These schemes
exist, for example, in France where new small firms are exempted from paying
social insurance contributions for as long as 12 months after their creation.
However, estimating the benefit of social insurance for entrepreneurs is an
additional key factor needed in order to fully assess the optimality of such firm
age-dependent social insurance schemes, which we leave for future research to
investigate.

Figure 1: Social Insurance Contributions Over Time: Treatment and Control Groups.

16
Notes: This Figure plots public pension insurance contributions (in logs) over time for the treatment and control groups for all firms
(top panel), young firms (second panel) and old firms (third panel). We define young firms as firms that are younger than 5 years of
age, and old firms as firms that are older than 5 years of age.

Figure 2: Effect on Firm-Level Outcomes for Young Firms

17
Notes: This Figure plots the response of firm-level outcomes to the 2011 reform for the treatment and control groups for young firms,
which we define as firms that are younger than 5 years of age. Turnover, wage costs, investments in machines and equipment and
stock holdings (in logs) are plotted in the first, second, third and fourth panels, respectively.

Figure 3: Effect on Firm-Level Outcomes for Old Firms

18
Notes: This Figure plots the response of firm-level outcomes to the 2011 reform for the treatment and control groups for old firms,
which we define as firms that are older than 5 years of age. Turnover, wage costs, investments in machines and equipment and stock
holdings (in logs) are plotted in the first, second, third and fourth panels, respectively.

Notes: This Table shows descriptive statistics for the control and treatment groups. The samples include firms belonging to the
treatment or control group for the time period 2006-2010. We define young firms as firms that are younger than 5 years of age,
otherwise they are defined as old. The treatment group is defined as firms with ownership shares of 31 to 50% prior to 2011 and the
control group as firms with ownership shares of 51 to 70% prior to 2011. Monetary variables are presented in current euros.

APPENDIX: FOR ONLINE PUBLICATION
Figure 4: Changes in Ownership Shares over Time

Notes: This Figure plots changes in ownership shares over time in 2006-2016. The first panel
shows the changes in ownership shares for owners with more than 50% ownership shares to
less than 50%. The second panel shows the changes in ownership shares for owners with
less than 50% ownership shares to more than 50%. The third panel shows the changes
in ownership shares for owners with less than 30% ownership shares to more than 30%.
Overall, there are no significant changes across these thresholds over time or around the
2011 reform.
