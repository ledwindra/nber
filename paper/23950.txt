ABSTRACT
Economic integration has brought about not only benefits and opportunities but also required adjustment,
especially for the youth entering the labour force. The lower growth rates characterizing the post Global
Financial Crisis era and the concerns about income inequality put to the fore the degree that better
targeted investment in human capital may ameliorate the challenges facing the working poor. Using
cross-country data, we find the association between the income shares of the working poor, dependence
on manufacturing sector, and the availability of vocational education. Conditioning on tertiary educational
attainment, improved access to better vocational education will probably contribute more than large
increase in regular college attainment. Comparing the US to Germany suggests that pushing more
students to BA granting colleges may no longer be the most efficient way to deal with the challenges
caused by the decline in manufacturing employment affecting in particular lower-income households.
We also note that a tracking of technical training and educational budget, shown in the case of Vietnam
in comparison to Thailand, as well as government subsidies for reskilling of labour fource throughout
their career in Singapore, is a potential explanation for their relative manufacturing competitiveness.

Introduction

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the resultant growth deceleration eventually focused
attention on increasing inequality, and specifically on the declining real incomes of the working
poor. The evidence of the increasing inequality is meticulously documented, most notably by
Piketty’s (2014) now famous Capital in the 21st Century.
At the same time, the role of education and acquired skills in upward mobility and in generating
growth has also been well appreciated (e.g., ILO, 2014. Behar, 2016). The potential for jobrelated training as a means to achieve growth in incomes and reductions in inequality has been
noted, as well (e.g., Attanasio et al., 2017). However, lingering questions remain about the
types of educational programs associated with the most effective improvement in incomes at
the lower end of the income distribution; and what factors shape the effectiveness of these
programs.
This generated a significant debate and disagreement in the recent US elections. “Free college”
was an effective rallying cry for Clinton's primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. At the
Democratic Convention, Sanders gave a speech endorsing Clinton, in which he said: "We have
come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will
guarantee that the children of any family [in] this country with an annual income of $125,000
a year or less…will be able to go to a public college or university tuition-free." Clinton herself
also backed universal free community college. Both these two proposed programs taken
together are estimated to cost half a trillion dollars if phased in over four years (CRFB, 2016).
Obviously, these plans will not be implemented soon given the election results, but the public
debate about the cost of higher education in the United States has certainly not been resolved.
In this paper we question this focus on higher education as a solution to the declining low
incomes and increasing inequality problems. With limited resources, what should be the focus
of subsided education? Is (nearly) free college education the key for a solution to these
problems? Will it likely address the problems of the working poor? In order to answer these
questions, we examine the data.
Looking at the OECD countries, an observed pattern and a tentative answer is that improved
access to better vocational education can probably contribute more than large increases in
college attainment. Using the OECD data, we confirm an observed quantifiable association
between the income shares of the working poor and the availability and take-up of vocational
2

education. Contrasting the United States and Germany suggests that pushing more students to
degree-granting colleges may not be an efficient way to deal with the declining real incomes
of the working poor. Such policy may induce private and public overinvestment in higher
(degree) education by some segments of the population, with little observed economic returns.
Before we turn to the evidence (in section 2 and 3), we add a few more observations from the
literature that has examined the efficacy of vocational training programs in specific countries.
Previous empirical research on vocational training, from LaLonde (1986) onward, has largely
focussed on specific training programs training the under- or un-employed, and more recently
usually within the context of randomized control trials methodology for treatment
identification. Recent examples include Attanasio et al. (2017) which provides a long-term
analysis of such a program in Colombia, Blattman et al. (2014) which focus on a training
program in Uganda, and Card et al. (2011) on youth vocational training in the Dominican
Republic. The findings from this literature are mixed, with, not surprisingly, differing levels of
efficacy associated with different programs.
More similar to our interest, another strand of the literature has posed the question whether
public policy should prefer more generally investment in vocational or academic training, but
this literature is generally older and also focuses on specific country experiences—e.g., Yang
(1998) on China. Moenjak and Worswick (2003), for example, examine individual data from
Thailand and the choice between general and vocational education, and finds a financial benefit
associated with vocational training. El-Hamidi (2006) examines this choice in Egypt, and
arrives at the opposite preference, arguing that general education coupled with on-the-job
training provides the highest benefit. Chen (2009) and Newhouse and Suryadarma (2011) using
detailed data from the Indonesia household panel survey, find more nuanced differences in the
employment outcomes of those who received academic vs. vocational education at the uppersecondary level; heterogeneities appear to depend on the gender, the cohort, and the socioeconomic background of the students examined. 1
There are other important factors affecting the mode of education and patterns of inequality.
We do not intend to capture all of them in this paper. Students may choose to take up vocational

Malamod and Pop-Eleches (2010), examining evidence from Romania, conclude that identified
differences between those who pursue the academic vs. the vocational track are largely driven by selfselection into these two options, rather than by any impact of the tracks themselves. Meer (2007) finds
evidence from US data that accounting for self-selection overturns previous conclusions in favour of
vocational tracking.

training rather than pursue their passion in university degree of choice because of financial
reasons. This can represent a form of inequality in educational access. It is also not clear that
denying educational desire at the personal level (e.g. giving up a BA in English to pursue
vocational training in healthcare because of the latter’s financial advantage) will lead to an
improved wellbeing, even if increased incomes materialise.
In the next section, we describe the previously unexamined cross-country evidence which
forms the backbone of our analysis, while we discuss some comparative case studies
contrasting the US with Germany and Thailand with Vietnam in Section 3. We end with some
concluding remarks in Section 4.

Cross-Country Evidence

2.1.

Data

We combine data from several sources. We use the World Wealth and Income Database (Top
10% Income Share) and OECD data (S80S20, P90P10, GINI) 2 for measurements of inequality.
For manufacturing and exports, we use data series from the World Development Indicators:
Manufacturing value added as share of GDP, manufacturing exports as share of merchandise
exports, high-technology exports as share of manufactured exports, and trade as percentage of
GDP. For access to vocational education, we use OECD data on the share of vocational
programmes as percentage of upper secondary education, UNESCO data on the share of youth
(15-24 years old) enrolled in secondary education, Eurostat data for the number of enterprises
providing continuing vocational training (CVT) as share of all enterprises, percentage of
employees from all enterprises participating in CVT courses, and cost of CVT courses as
percentage of total labour cost. The estimation sample includes at most 21 countries, depending
on the variables used in estimation, covering the years 2003-2013. Table 1 provides a country
list and summary statistics; the vocational training data is only available for 10 countries, so
these constitute our most restricted sample.
For inequality, we see in the data in Table 1 a wide variation across measures and countries.
The top 10% income share ranges from 14.6% in Mauritius to 61.0% in South Africa, with a
standard deviation of 9.0% for the full 21-countries sample. Our sample drops to 13 OECD

countries when we examine the S80S20, and gini data. These three measures are very highly
correlated with the 13 countries for which we have data, so it is of little importance which of
the three is used in the regressions described below. 3 According to all three inequality measures
for this very limited subset of countries, the most unequal countries are Portugal, Spain and the
United Kingdom, while the most equal ones are the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands,
and Germany (the United States is not included because of the lack of vocational training data).
On the size of the manufacturing sector, China has the largest in our sample (31.6% of GDP),
while Norway has the smallest (8.9%). According to Deloitte (2010, 2013, 2016), four of the
biggest five manufacturing countries are in our sample: China, Germany, Japan, and the UK.
We also include measures of exports, and the variability in this measure is very high: Some
countries hardly export any manufacturing, while others export almost exclusively
manufacturing; there is similar variability in the amount of high-tech exports, and the total
trade to GDP ratio.
On the share of vocational education, Netherlands has the highest indicator (68.3%), while
South Africa has the lowest (8.9%). As we noted previously, South Africa has the highest top
10% income share, and the lowest share of vocational education, while the Netherlands has
almost the opposite. Across countries, the correlation between a measure of inequality (top
10% income share) and measures of vocational education is always negative. It is about -0.3
for the share of vocational education, -0.5 for the share of continuing vocational training (CVT)
enterprises, -0.4 for the share of CVT employees, and -0.4 for the CVT costs.

3. Empirical Specification
Most of our regressions are limited to the 10 countries for which there is CVT data, so we
choose to exploit the time dimension of the available data for countries for which the CVT is
available. We estimate a panel model, and use a fixed-effects estimation:
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿(𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 + 𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

(1)

where 𝛼𝛼, 𝛽𝛽, 𝛾𝛾, 𝛿𝛿 denote parameters for estimation; 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 is the country fixed-effects, t is the linear
time trend and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the vector of regression residuals (assumed iid).

The correlation coefficient between the first two measures in 0.97, while between the second two
measures the correlation is 0.92.
5

3

Table 2 reports coefficient estimates for equation (1). In column (1), we find that both the
relative size of the manufacturing sector and the share of vocational education are positively
associated with the top 10% income share. In a standard trade model, both terms-of-trade
adjustment and technological bias for skilled labor can give rise to the increasing inequality.
Interestingly, we find that an interaction of the relative size of the manufacturing sector and the
share of vocational education is negatively associated with the top 10% income share. As
manufacturing sector becomes more important in a country’s income, relatively unskilled
labors benefit from access to vocational education, thereby narrowing the income gap with
skilled labor. Alternative specifications using manufacturing/GDP and high-tech exports/total
exports provide the same qualitative results.
Table 3 provides coefficient estimates using alternative measures of inequality and educational
access to vocational training.

As we have previously observed that these measures of

inequality are highly correlated in our sample, these robustness checks are largely supportive
of the baseline estimates. There is less variation in other measures of inequality relative to the
top 10% income share (as shown in the summary statistics), but the effects of manufacturing
sector and share of vocational education remain statistically significant also for S80S20, and
GINI.
Figure 1 illustrates the marginal effects of vocational share on inequality for three different
levels of manufacturing’s contribution in two baseline and two robust models (low, medium
and high corresponds to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of manufacturing). Specifically, at
low level of manufacturing contribution, increasing vocational share is correlated with either
an increase or only a small reduction in inequality, ceteris paribus. However, as manufacturing
increase its relative share in the economy, incremental improvement in vocational education’s
access for students is associated with significantly larger decline in inequality. This
phenomenon might be explained by the supply and demand in the market for skilled labour.
Unless improving acess to vocational education is accompanied by simultaneous increase in
manufacturing jobs, the potential reduction in inequality might be missed.
Most importantly, the alternative measures of educational access to vocational training—share
of vocational education in upper education, the cost of vocational training, share of youth (15-

6

24 years old) enrolled in secondary education —all yield consistent results with our main
findings. 4
In order to examine the relative importance of tertiary versus vocational education in tackling
inequality, we include the ratio of labour force with tertiary qualification and its interaction
with manufacturing to our baseline model. 5 The regression results as well as the comparison
of two interaction effects are reported in Table 4 and Figure 2, respectively. Even though both
vocational and tertiary share are positively correlated with rising inequality, the interaction
effects are negative and significant. Moreover, the interaction of vocational share is much
higher in absolute term, which suggest that as manufacturing contributes more and more to the
economy, vocational education appears to be a better complementary policy that can reduce
inequality.

4. Case Studies
4.1. Germany versus USA
The post GFC dynamics in the US put to the fore the decline in manufacturing employment
there. A narrative gaining political momentum (and the presidency) has been that US
manufacturing employment decline is the outcome of globalization. Accordingly, NAFTA, the
WTO, and other trade agreements, and the sizable current account deficits of the US were the
key drivers for the decrease in manufacturing employment. In contrast, according to this
narrative, China and Germany are prime examples of countries benefiting from globalization.
This section reflects on these arguments, focusing on the contrast between Germany and the
USA.
To put these claims in the longer-term perspective, Figure 3 reports the manufacturing
employment shares, 1970-2012, vividly showing that the trend decline in manufacturing
employment is common to both Germany and the US. While Germany’s level of manufacturing
employment remains well above that of the US—higher by 13% in 1970 and about 10% in
2012—both countries experienced continuing employment declines, at annual rate of loss of

These results are consistent with micro-econometric case studies dealing with emerging markets—
e.g., Moenjak and Worswick (2003) for Thailand, and Attanasio et al. (2011 and 2017) for Colombia.

0.47% in Germany, and 0.38% in the US. Indeed, similar trends apply across other OECD
countries, and even beyond the high-income countries to many emerging markets. 6
Figure 4 provides pertinent information on the main driving factor, reporting the manufacturing
value added/GDP for Germany and the US during 1997-2015. Remarkably, despite the decline
in manufacturing employment share in Germany, the manufacturing GDP value added share
in Germany has been stable, at about 23%, recovering fully after a V shape adjustment during
and after the GFC. In contrast, during that past two decades, the US experienced a drop of
about 5% in the manufacturing value added, at the same time that manufacturing employment
share dropped by 6%.
These trends are in line with the view that technological changes were the key drivers affecting
both the US and Germany, though German overall increases in labor productivity generated
these differing outcomes. Figure 5 reports the index of real Unit Labor Costs in the
Manufacturing Sector, 1992-2016. The chart is consistent with the superior performance of
manufacturing in Germany relative to the US: the real unit labor cost in the US dropped by
about 10% in the US relative to Germany, at times that the manufacturing value added declined
significantly in the US, while it was constant in Germany.
The differential manufacturing performance of these two countries may be the outcome of
structural factors, as well as policies. While we cannot pin down a causal interpretation, we
note several structural differences between these countries that we think are important. The
educational attainment aggregate numbers of the two countries differ sharply. The labor force
in Germany is relatively more replete with workers with upper-secondary education, and the
labor force in the US with those who have tertiary education credentials. The share of workers
with upper secondary in Germany exceeds that of the US by about 15% points, and share of
workers with tertiary education in the US exceeds that of Germany by about 17% points (see
Table 5). On its face, therefore, the US labor force is more educated or more highly skilled.
Other noteworthy difference are the design of public policies more generally and specifically
the patterns of inequality and redistribution. The safety net in Germany is deeper and wider
than in the US, covering more people and with more resources, and the income inequality in
the US is substantially higher than that in Germany (see Table 5). Given the relative success
Globalization, thus, does not appear to be a zero sum game of winners and losers in the
struggle for trade. It hard to see how globalization can explain the almost universal declines in
manufacturing employment.

of German manufacturing value added in recent decades, it is likely that Germany’s education
system fits better the needs of modern manufacturing. It is likely, as had been hypothesised
before, that modern manufacturing requires more upper-secondary and vocationally trained
labor rather than more workers with tertiary academic education.
The public policy concern about over-investment in four-year colleges in the US largely
concentrates on the newer for-profit and online sectors (e.g., Deming, Goldin, and Katz, 2012).
Yet, the rise in the cost of college education at rates that are out of line with the expected
employability and the financial return associated with college education are found in all the
different components of the tertiary education system—from two-year public institutions that
are the cheapest, to the four-year private for-profits that are generally the most expensive and
show the lowest return on investment. The very large system of tertiary education in the US is
very heterogeneous, but it puts the main emphasis on the four-year college system (both private
and public, and for- and non-profit). This overinvestment is found in all parts of the system,
and is partly driven by a lack of information about the distribution of the college premium in
all types of institutions. 7
Other concerns, beyond escalating costs and overinvestment, are the limited information
available to students regarding the alternatives available to them. There are also concerns about
the information regarding co-funding with federally subsidized loans, which allows many
colleges to survive despite delivering a low-quality education with clearly negative financial
returns. These funding models saddle the working poor with high debt burden that appears
unjustified by the low return on their investment.
The total outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. is US$ 1.2 trillion, the second-highest level
of consumer debt behind only mortgages. 8 These facts are consistent with the mismatch
hypothesis -- there are too many four-year colleges serving too many students, and too few

7 The college premium is the return to college education in terms of additional lifetime income. We
know very little about the distribution of these premiums at the lower end of the income distribution.
8
Marketwatch (2016) reported that about 40 million Americans hold student loans and about 70% of
bachelor’s degree recipients graduate with debt. One in four student loan borrowers are either in
delinquency or default on their student loans, according the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

institutions with greater focus on vocational education and training. This mismatch is sustained
by the skewed assistance scheme that is facilitated by the federal government. 9
While manufacturing employment share has declined substantially in both countries, the
shallower safety net in the US may explain why this issue has generated greater social impact
in the US than in Germany. The first-ever decline in life expectancy in some parts of the US,
and the growing despair of the displaced less educated workers in the US, identified by Case
and Deaton (2015 and 2017), probably reflects these shallower safety net. It may resemble
more the dynamics in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its own deindustrialization, rather than the dynamics observed in Germany. 10
The vocational employment training (VET) in Germany is much more developed. The CESifo
database on Institutional Comparisons in Europe (DICE) includes a lot of institutional detail
about the VET found in many European countries (and where the data is available, also the
US). 11 For example, Germany starts identifying students who are struggling in the ‘academic’
track in middle school (7th grade), and has various mechanisms in place to assist these students
to succeed in VET programs, while in the US, any assistance that is available, is only for
students once they drop out of a ‘normal’ high-school, and can get assistance to receive a GED
(a certificate that is considered equivalent to completing high-school). Vocational training even
after that (post-secondary) is still rare, and is almost only found if it is organised privately for
specific professions.
Rebalancing the post-secondary education system in the US with more vocational training may
not be a panacea. 12 Yet, overlooking the need to align the education system with the demands
A Brookings study, Looney and Yannelis (2015), found that a large share of the growth in the
number of students struggling to pay off their student loans is from students borrowing to attend forprofit schools. These public policy concerns are magnified by the fact that student debt in the US is
not erased if one declares bankruptcy, unlike credit card debt. Mortgage debt is even easier to walk
away from. Hence, student debt is especially pernicious and damaging as it is more long-lasting.
10
Germany had its fair share of socially costly dislocation associated with the unification of East and
West Germany. The contrasting dynamics between the US and Germany validate Rodrik (2011)’s
conjecture that deeper safety is conducive towards smoother globalization and the adjustment to new
technologies.

12
Notably, Hanushek et al. (2017) concluded that vocational education is harmful in the later phases
of work careers - vocationally qualified workers are the first to be laid off after the age of 50 because
their specific skills are likely to be outdated. Yet, Forster et al. (2016) noted that, while it may be true
that people with vocational qualifications are less likely to be employed later in their career, this
pattern may be unrelated to the way that vocational education is organized. Specifically, they argue
that the warning of Hanushek et al. (2017) to the proponents of a German style vocational training
system should imply that the late career disadvantage of vocational degrees would be more
10

of the real economy comes with growing personal and social costs. We close this case study
by noting that the US mortgage debt crisis of 2008-2010, and the education debt overhang in
the US may both be indicative of structural differences that led to over-investment in both real
estate and in college education in the US relative to Germany. 13
3.2 Thailand versus Vietnam
Thailand and Vietnam are middle-income countries striving for export-led manufacturing
success in global markets. 14 In the Global Manufacturing Competitiveness (GMC) report
(Deloitte, 2016) they are, together with Indonesia, Malaysia and India, have been considered
as the “Mighty Five” or the potential substitutes for China in terms of new manufacturing hubs.
For the past three decades, cheap labour, favorable demographics characteristics, and proximity
to Japan, Korea, and China have contributed to their performance in manufacturing exports.
The past decade, however, saw even cheaper labour, from other middle-income countries,
eroding the comparative advantage of both Thailand and Vietnam, while the learning-by-doing
increasing returns dynamics that are sometimes associated with participation in global supply
chains has proved to be rather elusive for these two emerging economies. 15
Figures 6 illustrates the structure of the educational system in Thailand and Vietnam. With
regards to the technical and vocational training, an earlier start of tracking and differentiation
in Vietnam (lower secondary) than in Thailand (upper secondary) is a notable difference. For
Thailand, the vocational programmes are under the Ministry of Education, while Vietnam
legislated its two institutions (Ministry of Education and Training, and Ministry of LabourInvalids and Social Affairs) to oversee the technical training. 16 In both countries, there is a

pronounced in countries with a large dual system (i.e., work and school based). Looking at the data,
they did not find evidence of that difference. On the contrary, German-like education systems with a
strong emphasis on dual tracks are characterized by less disadvantage late in the careers of
vocationally qualified workers. The negative effect of vocational training at the end of the career are
observable statistically only in countries that do not have dual-track systems, like the United States
and Canada.
13
This over-investment may reflect structural factors such as the differential use in leverage in
funding housing and education services in the two countries, the differential tax system, and the
greater role of private and for-profits education in the US (see Aizenman and Noy, 2012).
14
According to the World Bank’s Development Indicators, in 2015, GDP per capita in Thailand was
almost USD 6000, while in Vietnam it was about USD 2100.
15
At least partially, this difficulty is surly rooted in the political challenges Thailand and Vietnam are
facing. The former is currently ruled by the military, following a coup in 2014, the latter is under the
absolute rule of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
16
In fact, since January 2017, vocational education’s management has been fully transferred to the
Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs in Vietnam.
11

lack of micro-level evidence on the effectiveness of vocational training. The preference for
university education in both countries also stigmatizes the acquisition of vocational
certification and reduces the desirability of vocational degrees. This, of course, implies that
those who self-select into the vocational track may do so not out of a preference but because
the academic track is closed for them. Consequently, if academic performance might be
considered as positively correlated with ability and earning potential, these vocational
graduates would end up with lower income and therefore even worsen public perceptions on
vocational education. On the other hand, in both countries, low quality of training and lack of
harmonized skill accreditation system also prevented vocational qualifications from being
sufficiently recognized by employers (Huang, 2012). Together with poor public perception,
these inadequate recognitions have contributed to relatively low enrolment rate of vocational
education at all levels in both countries.
The contrasts between Thailand and Vietnam are noticeable in the budget allocation for
education. Both countries spent close to 5% of GDP on education, similar to more advanced
economies such as Germany and the United States. Yet, as shown in Figures 7.a and 7.b,
Vietnam allocated almost 20% of the education budget on upper-secondary education
(vocational training included), while Thailand expensed only 10% for the upper-secondary
level. 17
In terms of institutional framework, only Vietnam has issued the Law of Vocational Training
(2006), which has been continuosly reviewed and revised. Since its adoption, the law has
substantially improved the management of vocational education and its quality in Vietnam
(Hilal, 2013). Perhaps its investment in vocational training and institutional difference help
explain the forecast that Vietnam is about to overtake Thailand for its global manufacturing
competitiveness 18.
Figures 8.b and 8.b provide the level of manufacturing competitiveness together with some
underlying factors. Based on the survey of CEOs by Deloitte (2010, 2013, 2016), by the next

According to Vietnam Vocational Training Report 2013-2014, on average, expenditure on
vocational education & training accounts for approximately 7.9% of Vietnam’s total government
expenditure during this period (around 40% of total education budget.)
18 Younger labour force as well as more competitive unit labour cost in manufacturing might also
partially contribute to this forecast. Latest Labour Force survey in both countries reveal that youth
(age 15-24) account for 10.6% and 15% of the total labour force in Thailand and Vietnam,
respectively. In addition, Thailand’s unit labor cost in manufacturing is approximately 40% higher
than in Vietnam (GMC report, 2016)
12
17

decade Vietnam is expected to rise to be the 12th among the top manufacturing exporters
globally, while Thailand will remain at the 14th place.
Currently, not enough data is available to determine if indeed Vietnam’s additional investment
in technical and vocational training, and its add-on effects to the manufacturing sector, would
eventually translate into lower income inequality in Vietnam (and to a lesser extent in
Thailand). Currently, the richest 20% have more than 40% of national income in both
countries. Shown in Figures 9.a and 9.b, the gap between the top 20% and the bottom 20% has
been fairly constant for the past three decades. Access to vocational training may be an
important component of a possible strategy for reducing this inequality.

5.

Conclusions

Labour saving technological innovations probably account for the decline in manufacturing
employment share more than international trade. The declining employment share in
manufacturing resembles the earlier collapse of employment share in agriculture, though the
speed of the adjustment has accelerated substantially. As information technology and more
recently artificial intelligence impact more sectors, there is as yet no evidence that the new
disruptive technologies will open up new lines of employment at a rate that will be sufficient
to compensate for the disappearance of employment in old industries (Acemoglu and Restrepo,
2017). Furthermore, it is not clear that the skills required for these new jobs will be matched
with those workers whose jobs disappeared. This renewed need for better matching of skills
between workers and new jobs will most definitely be affected, to a certain extent, by the
quantity and quality of vocational training available in each country. It is this vocational
training that we see as playing a central role in determining the outcomes for the low-skilled,
low-wage, workers that populate the lower part of the income distribution. It is thus this
vocational training that can have a large impact on income inequality.
The quantitative evidence on the role of vocational training is imperfect, but both the
limited cross-country evidence analysed here, and the comparisons we made convinced us that
well-resourced and well-targeted vocational training can prove to be a better long-term
investment in skill acquisition and can assist in ameliorating the difficulties faced by those
workers whose jobs are currently disappearing and whose prospects look, in many cases, to be
quite bleak.
13

A key challenge for the countries on the technological frontier will therefore be to
provide this vocational training and re-training that will hopefully prevent the jobless future
whose consequences we do not yet quite understand. Failing to do this, countries will either
have to rapidly upgrade their safety net to avoid increasing destitution, or to face the
consequences of the greater political instability and the social costs associated with the
hollowing-out of the middle class—political instability that is most likely associated with such
anomalies as the Brexit vote, the US election of 2016, and other recent electoral surprises.
An example of government playing very active role in vocational education is
Singapore. Since 2016, the government has subsidised any training courses (currently about
9,000) from educational providers, including universities and online learning, for SGD500 to
Singaporean workers above the age of 25, and up to 90% for workers above the age of 40 (The
Economist, January 12, 2017). While Singapore is known for its entrepot and manufacturing
economy, this type of government program has a potential to help reskill and protect workers
from adverse trade effects and adjustment in the global competitive market landscape.
In the future, we hope to work on extensions that will examine: (i) the importance of
vocational training in the service sectorss (manufacturing is the declining sector in the OECD
and in some emerging countries), (ii) more detailed accounting of the quality of vocational and
college education, and (iii) the impact of vocational training on poverty (i.e., the income share
of the working poor).

Note: The marginal effects of vocational share on predicted inequality are constructed by holding manufacturing variable
constant at the 25th – 50th – 75th percentile, which correspond to Low – Medium - High level of manufacturing’s contribution
to the economy. Manufacturing contribution is measured by manufacturing share in GDP (% value added) or manufacturing
share in total merchanise export. Each graph corresponds corresponds to one specification in Table 2 and Table 3.
