Legality and Reality: Some Evidence on Criminal Procedure*

William M. Landes
University of Chicago and National Bureau of Economic Research

There is widespread concern that the criminal justice system,
particularly in large urban areas, is breaking down under the strain of

an increasing demand for its services and inadequate resources. At the
center of the system, located between the police and the prisons, are

the criminal courts. Allegedly, the courts no longer serve the interest
of law-abiding citizens or the constitutional rights of persons accused

of crimes. Defendants are treated capriciously with the guilty and
dangerous recycled through the courts and set free within hours of their
arrest, while the innocent languish in jail for lack of bail funds.

Statistics on rising crime rates, recidivism, arbitrary sentencing practices,
court delay, and prison riots are taken as further evidence that the courts

are failing. What has been notably scarcer is systematic empirical

2.

research on the criminal court system--research that can contribute to
our understanding of the actual workings of the system and enable us to

develop policies for improvement. The purpose of this study is to begin
to remedy this deficiency by applying the quantitative techniques of
economics to an analysis of some important issues in criminal court procedure.

The theoretical framework for the study is based on my two recent
papers on the courts and on the bail system.

In these papers, I

advanced hypotheses on the determination of bail, and the effects of
pretrial status and other variables on plea bargaining, sentencing and

other methods of disposition. In this study, I attempt to test these
hypotheses using a rich source of data: a random sample of 858 defendants
in criminal court in New York City in 1971 containing detailed information
on the defendant's prior criminal record and socio-economic characteristics,
the criminal charges against the defendant, the various court proceedings
involving the defendant, and the outcome of the case.

The paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the sample
and defines the variables used inthe study. Section II contains an empirical
analysis of the determinants of pretrial status where we analyze the factors
determining the terms on which a defendant may obtain his pretrial liberty.
Section III, the main section of the paper, tests whether the factors
determining pretrial liberty are also significant predictors of the

amount of harm a defendant will do if released on bail. This enables us
to distinguish between the two dominant hypotheses on the social function

of bail. The first asserts that the primary function of a bail system
is to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial; the second emphasizes
the desirability of using the bail process as a means of preventing future

3.

crimes by defendants.

Our empirical analysis reveals that the

second hypothesis is more consistent with actual behavior: the factors
that lead to the setting of higher bail bonds (which, in turn, are
shown to reduce the likelihood of pretrial liberty) are significant
predictors of the likelihood of coninitting crimes during the period of

pretrial liberty but have little predictive power in explaining the high
disappearance rate (around 30 per cent) of persons released on bail.
This finding, which is the main contribution of the study, provides a
powerful rationale (that is, the prevention of future crimes during the
period of pretrial liberty) for the operation of the current bail system-though a rationale that some would argue is inadequate when weighed against

the restrictions imposed on the rights of the accused. Section IV focuses
on the disposition of cases where we examine the role of pretrial deten-

tion, delay and other variables on the outcome of cases. Section V summarizes
our findings and presents concluding remarks.

I. The Data
The data for our study is a random sample of 858 defendants in
New York County who were represented by the Legal Aid Society during the
The sample was limited to defendants whose arraignment took

place in the first half of 1971, and whose cases were in the Society's

closed files as of December 15, 1971. Cases were placed in the closed
files if there were no further proceedings involving the defendant.
Thus, our sample consists of completed cases which allows us to trace each
defendant through the courts from his arraignment to the final disposition
of his case.

offenders

The sample excludes females, juveniles, and youthful

(roughly, males under 21 years of age), defendants who replaced

4.

Legal Aid counsel with private counsel, and defendants whose cases

were disposed of at the time of their arraignment. A defendant's
arraignment takes place within 24 hours of his arrest, and a substantial

proportion (roughly 37 per cent of cases in the Society's closed files)

are completed at this time. Frequently, the charges against the defendant
are dismissed at the arraignment because the complaining witness does

not appear. Since the procedural questions we seek to investigate do
not come into play until after the arraignment, the exclusion of these
cases is consistent with our overall interest.

There are other limitations to the data that should be noted. Legal
Aid is restricted to low income defendants. However,the majority of
criminal defendants in New York City have low incomes as evidenced by the
fact that the Legal Aid Society serves as counsel to about 70 per cent
of all defendants in New York.

The similarity between our sample of

Legal Aid defendants and all criminal defendants in New York City is
apparent from the data presented in Table 1 on the method of disposition
of cases, the proportion of defendants not appearing, and the proportion
of Supreme Court cases.

One must also be cautious about deriving infer-

ences on the operation of the criminal justice system in the U.S. from data

limited to low income defendants in New York, particularly in view of the
belief that New York's judicial system is more overburdened and closer to

collapse than that of other large cities. Finally, it would be incorrect
to treat the sample as representative of the population of criminal offenders

in New York or elsewhere. Defendants are persons arrested and charged with
a crime and their characteristics may be very different than a sample that
also included offenders who were not apprehended.

Table 2 presents a portrait of defendants in the sample classified

by the type of offense and the severity of the charge. The sample is
widely distributed among offense types with the largest proportion of
defendants (29 per cent) accused of drug offenses (including both possession

and sale with the former being the less severe offense). ' With respect

to the severity of the charge, the majority of defendants in the sample

are accused of felonies (61 per cent). Since defendants are typically
charged with multiple offenses, the severity and offense class are deter-

mined by the most severe charge against the defendant. The second part of
Table 2 indicates the New York Penal Code penalties (in years) for the
various felony and misdemeanor charges. These penalties in turn are the
basis for a rough index of the severity of the charge against the defendants
(see Table 3).

For convenience we present in Table 3 a list of the variables used

in the empirical analysis. The definitions of the variables given in the
table are brief and where necessary they are supplemented in the text.

For further reference we also include in Table 3 the means and standard
deviations of the variables.

II. Pretrial Status
The pretrial status of a person arrested and charged with a crime is
affected by the court's decision regarding the terms on which the defendant
may obtain his pretrial release, and the defendant's demand for release

or his ability and willingness to meet the terms set by the court. The
first part of this section investigates the former question.

the factors determining the size of the bail bond, and the related
question of whether the defendant is offered the option of a cash
alternative (that is, depositing a relatively small amount of cash as

an alternative to posting a bail bond). The second part of this section
analyses the empirical determinants of the defendant's demand for pretrial release with particular reference to the effects of the "price"
charged for release and the defendant's socio-economic characteristics.

The Determination of Bond
Multiple regression equations were estimated on the dependent variable,

the dollar value of the bond set by the court. The specification of the
regression equation is as follows:
BOND1=

+

+

+

+

+ u.

(1)

where X, Y, Z and D are vectors of severity of offense variables, criminal
record variables, socio-economic variables and dummy offense variables
respectively, u is the residual, and the subscript i denotes the particular

defendant. (See Table 3 for the definition of variables included in these
classes.)

The purpose of including in equation (1) variables measuring the
severity of the offense (the X vector) and the defendant's prior record
(the Y vector) is based on two hypotheses:

Hypothesis I. The size of the bond is a position function of the
harm the defendant is expected to do if released where harm
includes either or both (a) the likelihood the defendant will

interfere with the proceedings against him (primarily by fleeing
or not appearing), and (b) the potential dangerousness of the

defendant in terms of crimes comitted during the period of
pretrial liberty.

12.

Hypothesis II. The severity of offense variables (except for
possibly the confession variable) and the prior record variables
are positively related to the amount of harm a defendant will do
if released on bail.

In other words, these variables provide

information on harm (Hypothesis II), and this information is then
utilized by judges (Hypothesis I) in setting bond.

We will assume provisionally that the second hypothesis is in fact true,
and test the first hypothesis by examining whether the severity of the
offense and prior record variables are positively related to the size of
bond in equation (1).

The variables included in the severity of offense category require

further explanation. The severity of the formal charge (the ASC variable)
is a direct estimate of the severity of the offense that allegedly took
place.

According to Hypotheses I and II this variable should have a

positive and significant effect on the size of the bail bond. The
inclusion of other variables in the severity of offense category is based

on the possible inaccuracy of the ASC variable alone. For example, the
more serious the injury to a complaining witness (

i.e.,

the victim),

holding the formal charge constant, the greater the actual severity of the
crime and hence (according to hypotheses I and II) the greater the size
of bond.

Or defendants resisting arrest or having weapons in their

possession at the time of their arrest, holding the formal charge constant,
may be considered to have committed a more dangerous offense and hence
will have higher bail bonds.

The final variable included (somewhat

arbitrarily) in the severity of offense category is whether the defendant

confessed prior to setting the bond (the CON variable). We are uncertain
about the expected effect of this variable on bond.

24. F.

55 continued
rate of disappearance by setting more difficult terms for pretrial

release may still be a goal of the bail system but according to our
well

empirical results this goal would be equally/served by setting bond

randomly among defendants. One rationale of setting bond on the
basis of the severity and extent of one's prior record is to prevent
defendants with greater probabilities of committing crimes from

obtaining pretrial liberty. Note that one can never totally reject
the hypothesis that judges are attempting to forecast the probability
of disappearance in setting bond since it is conceivable that they
are attempting to do so but are unsuccessful in their efforts.

56.

It must be noted that our empirical findings are not intended as either

an indictment or defense of the existing bail system. We have quantified certain statistical relationships between bail setting and pretrial harm, but have not attempted to measure the social costs of
operating the bail system in comparison to the gains from preventing

pretrial crimes. For example, although the factors used in setting
bond also predict pretrial crime, they may be subject to considerable

error. Thus, detained defendants may have higher probabilities of
committing crimes during pretrial liberty than those not released,

and yet a majority of those detained may not commit any crime had they

been released. Moreover, if the aim of public policy were exclusively
the prevention of pretrial crime, the ideal solution would be to jail
every defendant.

16.

1. The Severity of Offense Variables. Overall, our findings
strongly support our predictions. The major indicator of severity, the
ASC variable, is positive and the most significant variable in all

equations in Table 4. Each additional unit (year) of severity adds on
average about $135 to the defendant's bond ;

for

example, a Class B

felony compared to a Class E felony is an increase in severity from 2 1/2

to 16 2/3 years, which in turn adds about $1900 to the size of bond. The
most significant of the other severity variables is an injury to the
complaining witness (INJ) where a severe injury adds between $400 and

$775 to the defendant's bond, other things constant. The resist arrest
variable (RES) has the predicted positive sign in all regressions but is

only marginally significant. The remaining severity of offense variables
(WPN and CON) have no significant effects on the size of bond.

2. Criminal Record Variables. The criminal record variables behave
in a manner that is highly consistent with Hypotheses I and II. Both
past felonies (FEL) and past misdemeanors (MIS) have positive and significant effects in all regression equations in Table 4, while past violations

(VIOL) have positive but insignificant effects. Of equal importance is
the relative rankings of these variables in the estimated regression

equations. In particular, a past felony arrest is statistically more
significant and has nearly four times the impact on the defendant's bond
than a past misdemeanor (for example, a past felony adds about $100 to
the bond while a past misdemeanor adds about $25, other things constant).

Since Hypothesis II combines both the severity of the offense and the
defendant's criminal record in forecasting the amount of harm from pretrial release, the empirical finding that past felonies have larger

17.

quantitative effects and are substantially more significant than past

misdemeanors and violations is understandable. Felonies are more severe
offenses, and hence a record or past felony arrests would indicate that
the defendant is expected to do greater harm if released that a defendant
with a past record of misdemeanors and viOlations.

We emphasize some

caution in interpreting the FEL, MIS and VIOL variables because they
indicate arrests not convictions (though based on the high rate of convictions in the current sample, arrests are probably highly correlated with

convictions). The parole or probation variables (PAR) is, however, a
measure of a prior conviction and one that may have resulted in a jail

sentence. This variable is highly significant and has a strong positive
impact on the size of bond in all regressions. A defendant on parole or
probation (holding constant prior arrests, the severity of the current charge
and other variables) has, on average, to post approximately a $600 higher
bond to obtain pretrial liberty than a defendant not on parole or probation.
The outstanding detainer variable (DEl) has a positive but non-signifi-

cant effect on the defendant's bond in all regressions in Table 4. An
outstanding detainer is a request to hold the defendant for a variety of
reasons such as a parole violation, a bail violation on a pending charge,
or a warrant for his arrest in another jurisdiction.

Since increasing

the size of bond is the principle means of detaining a person, one would
expect a positive relationship between bond and the presence of a detainer.
Part of the effect on bond of a detainer is picked up by the parole and
pending variables, but some additional effect remains though it is not
significant.

The final indicator of a defendant's criminal record is the pending

18.

variable (PEND). A defendant who has a pending charge has in the past
been arrested and charged with a crime, released on bail, and then
rearrested and charged with committing a new offense (that is, the current
charge) during the period of pretrial liberty.

One would expect the

pending variable to be an important deterninant of the bond. Since we
are arguing that prior information is a useful predictor of future behavior
(Hypothesis II) one predictor of this harm is the fact that the defendant

has recently comitted a crime during the period of pretrial release. .ii

The results contained in Table 4 are consistent with this hypothesis. The
regression coefficients on the pending variable are positive and significant
in all regressions, and indicate that a pending charge is associated with
about a $500 increase in the size of the bond holding constant the other
variables.

3. Socio-Economic Variables. Employment in legal activities (the
EMP variable) and the amount of earnings from legal employment (the EARN
variable) have significant negative effects on the size of the defendant's

bond in equations 4.3-4.5. Forty-seven per cent of the sample are currently
employed at the time of their arrest, and their average earnings is $106

per week. As weekly earnings rise due to both greater labor force
participation and higher hourly wages, the results in Table 4 indicate that
the size of bond falls.

This is consistent with the view that legal

earnings or employment are taken as crude measures of the defendant's
"ties" to the conmunity and as indicators of the likelihood that he will

appear for subsequent court appearances if released on bail. Whether this
variable in fact has any predictive power in forecasting nonappearances by

defendants will be tested later. The other socio-economic variables (AGE,
NYC, PREM and INC) have no significant effects on the size of bond. Except

19.

for NYC, the standard errors of these variables are all larger than their
respective regression coefficients.

4. The Dumy Offense Variables. Equation 4.5 differs from 4.4 in
that eight dumy variables indicating the specific crime category of the
defendant's offense have been added to 4.5. The dummy variables are
robbery (e.g.,

1 if the defendant is accused of robbery and 0 if he

is not), assault, burglary, stolen property, larceny, forgery, possession
of a dangerous weapon and "other" offenses--with the excluded category being
drug offenses. We include the durrmy variables to answer the following

question: Is there anything significant about the particular offense that
results in the setting of a lower or higher bail bond once we hold constant
the severity of the offense, the defendant's criminal record and his socio-

economic characteristics? The answer for the group of offenses taken
together is "no". An F-test performed on the eight dummy variables leads
us to accept the null hypothesis that the eight make no significant contribution to the reduction in the residual variance of the equation.
Cash Alternatives to Bond
Up to this point, the empirical analysis has focused on the deter-

minants of the size of the bail bond. However, posting a bond to obtain
pretrial release may not be the only option available to the defendant.
Some defendants are given the choicebetween posting a bond or depositing
with the court an amount of cash that is typically a small fraction of

the bond. The option of a cash alternative will generally reduce the difficulty of making bail since it eliminates the necessity of having access
to large sums of cash (for example, cash equal to the amount of the bond)

or assets that can be used as collateral for one's bond. Therefore, the

20.

possibility of cash alternatives means that an analysis of differences
in bond amounts alone may not accurately reflect differences in the

terms on which defendants may obtain their pretrial release. For example,
if one observed that a large proportion of defendants were given the option
of a cash alternative and that the proportion increased as the amount of
the bond increased, then this would seriously undermine the conclusion
that factors such as the severity of the offense, criminal record, etc.

are significant determinants of the terms of pretrial release. We can
investigate this and related questions using the data presented in Table 5
on the frequency of cash alternatives and their dollar amounts cross-classified by the size of bond.

The results of Table 5 indicate that: (1) the number of defendants
with cash alternativez are concentrated in the $500 bond category (i.e.,
82 per cent of defendants given cash alternatives were in this group); (2)
the proportion of defendants given the cash option rapidly declines with
the size of bond (except between the $2000-$3000 and $3500-$5000 classes

though the difference between 36 and 4.4 per cent is not statistically
significant); and (3) the amount of cash alternative tends to rise with the
size of bond (except for the sharp decline for the two defendants with

cash alternatives in the $3500—$5000 bond class). Overall, increases in
the size of bond generally understate the difficulty of being released on
bail. Hence, our finding based on the bond regressions that the severity
of the offense, criminal record, etc., are important determinants of the
terms on which the defendant may obtain pretrial liberty is strengthened
by the greater likelihood of a cash alternative for a defendant with
relatively low bond.

22.

The Probability of Pretrial Release
In theory, monetary requirements should have a significant negative
effect on ths probability of pretrail release since the greater the "price"
the defendant is required to pay to obtain pretrial release, the more likely
it will exceed the maximum he is willing to pay, and the less likely he

will be released. The maximum amount the defendant is willing to pay (given
the length of time of pretrial detention and the probability of reapprehension if released) will be positively related to the opportunity

cost of

his time, his wealth, the value he places on the non-pecuniary aspects of
pretrial liberty net of consumption provided him in prison, and any reductions in the expected future values of these variables resulting from pretrial detention (for example, lower expected future earnings if pretrial
detention raises the probability of conviction).

Table 6 presents data on the proportion of defendants released cross-

classified

by the size of bond and the option of a cash alternative. At

one extreme--the distinction between defendants not required to post any
bond and those required to pay something--monetary factors have a signifi-

cant effect on reducing the probability of pretrial release. Of the 333
defendants released prior to the dispositionof their cases, 253 were
released on their own recognizance ( i.e.,
$0 bond) while only 13.2 per cent (i.e.,

100 per cent of those with a
80 defendants) of defendants

required to post bond or pay a cash alternative were released.

This

result is not surprising since our sample consists of Legal Aid defendants;
i.e.,

persons in the lower tail of the income distribution where a

relatively small financial requirement is likely to exceed the maximum

amount they are able to pay. We also observe that at each level of bond
(greater than zero) the proportion released is substantially greater for

defendants given a cash alternative, and that for defendants without
a cash alternative the proportion released sharply declines as the size
of bond increases. It is apparent from Table 6 that monetary requirements
set by the court have a strong bearing on the pretrial status of defendants.

In order to measure the relative importance of variations in bond and
cash alternatives and the effects of other variables (for example, socio—
economic factors) on pretrial status, multivariate analysis is required.
However, the presence of a dichotomous dependent variable (

i.e.,

the

defendant is either released or not released) creates a problem in the
choice of the appropriate statistical method.

One approach is to treat a dichotomous dependent variable as if it were
a continuous variable, and estimate by ordinary least-squares (OLS) a
linear probability function of the form
=

+

ctV. + u .

(2)

where r is the probability of pretrial liberty for the i- defendant
-I

(which takes the value 1 if the defendant is released and 0 if he is not)
and

and V. are vectors of regression coefficients and independent

variables respectively. Several problems arise from the use of OLS in
the case of a dichotomous dependent variable. These include the sensitivity of the estimated regression coefficients to the location of the
explanatory variables (particularly, to extreme values), the inapplicability
of the usual tests of significance of the estimated coefficients, the
possibility that predicted values of some observations may be negative

or greater than one, and the heteroskedasticity of the residuals. To
avoid these difficulties we chose a maximum likelihood method of estimating
a logit model where the logit specification of the probability function

25.

is the following:
1

—

_(o + 1V.

+

The maximum likelihood method handles individual observations, restricts
the predicted values of the probability to between 0 and 1, and yields
asymptotic t-ratios that enable one to test the significance of the
estimated coefficients.

The coefficients in (3) are easily interpreted. For example, let
equal the coefficient on the variable Vk (where Vk denotes one of the

independent variables in (3)). We have

log (P r/(1—P r))

=

(4a)

and

krr

=

(4b)

Since Pr/(l_Pr) equals the odds of being released on bail, k equals the

proportionate change in the odds per unit change in Vk. The derivative,

Pr/Vk when evaluated at the mean probability of comitting a crime
allows us to compare directly the logit results with the regression coefficients derived from the linear probability model.

where the defendant's bond, the option of a cash alternative, and the
dollar amount of the cash alternative are denoted by BOND, CA1 and CA2
respectively, and where

is a vector of socio-economic characteristics

defined in Table 3.

One predicts that an increase in the defendant's bond will lower the
probability (or odds) of making bail, that the option of a cash alternative will raise the probability, and that an increase in the dollar amount
of the cashalternative (given this option) will lower the probability.

The interaction variable BONDCA1 is included to test the hypothesis that
increasing the amount of the bond will have no effect on the probability
of release when the defendant is given the option of a cash alternative.
The probability estimates are limited, however, by the absence of data on
variables that should affect the maximum amount the defendant is willing
to pay for release (

e.g.,

non-pecuniary aspects of detention, and

changes in future values of earnings and wealth), and by the availability

of imperfect measures of other relevant variables. In the latter category
are the socio-economic characteristics of defendants that are used to
approximate both the opportunity cost of detention and the defendant's wealth.
The logit equation in Table 7 shows that the bond and cash alternative
option variables are highly significant determinants of the probability of
pretrial release (as measured by the t-ratios on the appropriate interaction

variables). The logit estimates indicate, for example, that if the defendant
is not given a cash alternative (i.e.,

CA1 =

0),

a $100 increase in bond

leads to a reduction in the probability of release by .036 (at the mean

or by about 27 per cent. Alternatively, a $100 increase leads to a 30 per
cent reduction in the odds of pretrial release (for example, at the mean

odds this is a reduction from about .16 to .11). As predicted, increasing

the amount of bond produces no significant effect on the probability
of release when the defendant is given the option of a cash alternative
(CA1 =

1).

The impact of a cash alternative can be illustrated as follows:

a $100 cash alternative, assuming bond is set at $500, will raise the

defendant's probability of rease by .13 (at the mean probability) or by

about 100 per cent. Similarly, this $100 option increases the odds of
pretrial release by slightly more than 100 per cent. We also observe
that increasing the amount of the cash alternative by $100 reduces the
odds of pretrial liberty by about 26 per cent, though this effect is not
significant (i.e.,

the t-ratio =

1.3).

In contrast to the bond and

cash alternative variables, the socio-economic variables are not significant determinants of the probability of pretrial release.

Except for the

variable denoting residence in New York City, which has a positive and
marginally significant effect on the probability of release, the t-ratios
on the other socio-economic variables are all less than one.

Moreover, a

test on the joint significance of all five socio-economic variables

(including NYC) is consistent with the hypothesis of no effect10ne explanation of the non-significance of these variables is that they are inaccurate
estimates of a defendant's ability to finance bail because they do not
reflect regularity of employment, past earnings, savings, etc. or because
other sources of income (e.g.,

illegal sources) are negatively

related to measures of legal employment, earnings and other income.
Finally note that the OLS estimate of the probability function are quite
similar in magnitude and significance to the logit equation.

29.

III. Forecasting the Harm From Pretrial Release
We observed in the regression analysis of Table 4 a significant statistical relationship between the size of bond and variables measuring the
severity of the defendant's offense, his criminal record, and his socio-

economic characteristics. The crucial question is whether these variables
also predict the amount of harm a defendant will do if released on bail

(Hypothesis II, p. 12). If this question is answered affirmatively, then
in combination with the analysis of bond and pretrial release in general,
we will have identified an important social function of the existing bail

system and provided a rationale for its existence. The two sources of harm
we investigate are crimes comitted during the period of pretrial release,
and the disappearance of released defendants.

Crimes During the Period of Pretrial Release

The expected harm from crimes comitted during the period of pretrial

liberty can be subdivided into two components: the probability of comitting
a crime (or crimes), and the severity of the crime. We examine first the
former component. Unfortunately, the data available are not ideal and thus
our findings mustbe interpreted with some caution. We lack data on the
commission of crimes during the period of pretrial liberty by defendants
released on bail on their current charge.

Nevertheless, information

can be derived on crimes committed during the period of pretrial liberty
from the 59 defendants in our sample who at the time of the arrest on

their current charge also have a pending charge. This group of defendants
had in .the recent past been arrested and charged with a crime (i.e.,

their pending charge), released on bail, and then rearrested and charged

30.

with committing a new crime during the period of pretrial liberty
(i0e.,

their current charge).

One may object to treating all

defendants with a pending charge as if they were identical to persons

committing a crime during the period of pretrial release. Forty of the
59 defendants with a pending charge were in fact convicted on their cur-

rent charge, 10 had their cases dismissed and 9 disappeared. On the
other hand, to treat only the 40 convicted defendants as the group committing crimes during the period of pretrial release would eliminate some

who actually committed crimes but were not convicted. Some "guilty
defendants may have had their charges dismissed because of a technicality,
and there is no reason to presume that all defendants who disappeared did

not comit crimes. In view of our ignorance regarding which group is most
representative of defendants committing crimes, we present results for both
all pending defendants (59 defendants) and pending defendants who are

convicted (40 defendants). The former probably include some who did not
commit crimes during the period of pretrial release while the latter group

probably exclude some who did. (Hereafter, we refer to both groups as
the "Pending Group", and when necessary distinguish between the two by
the

terms All Pending" and "Convicted Pending".)
We can now compare the two Pending Groups with the group of defendants

released on bail who have no pending charges (hereafter, the "Non-Pending
Group".) The purpose of this comparison is to test whether there are
significant differences in the characteristics of the Pending and Non-Pending
groups (which would then be characteristics that forecast pretrial harm),
and whether these characteristics are related to the factors that determine

the size of bond. To illustrate, suppose we find that the Pending Group

31.

has a longer criminal record (at the time of their arrest on the pending

charge) than the Non-Pending Group. This would indicate that prior
criminal record provides information on the likelihood of comitting a
crime during the period of pretrial liberty. And one could infer that
the reason prior record is used in setting bond is because of the information it conveys on pretrial harm.

Table 8 contains for the Pending and Non-Pending groups the means
and standard deviations of independent variables used in the bond regres-

sions. Clearly, for the Pending group we desire variables recorded at
the time of the pending offense since it is these values that are available
to judges setting bond on the pending offense, and these values that are
relevant to predicting the conunission of an offense during the period of
pretrial liberty (

i.e.,

the current offense for persons with a pending

charge). Data are available on the severity and type of pending charge.
Unfortunately, there were no data relating to the pending offense for
several variables entered in the bond regressions.

Furthermore,

several variables included in Table 8 for the Pending Group should be used
with caution because they were recorded at the time of the arrest on the
current charge and hence may have changed since the time of the pending

charge. Specifically, data on employment, earnings, other income and residence
in Table 8 were recorded at the time of the current arrest. Data on the
type of offense (i.e.,

the eight dumy variables in the bond regression)

are also excluded from Table 8 since a comparison of means is clearly

inappropriate. (We pursue these variables with other statistical tests
later on.)

There are 59 defendants with a pending charge at the time of their arrest on the
current charge and 40 of these were convicted on their current charge. 328 defendants
are in the Non-Pending Group (defined as defendants relased on bail on the current
charge who had no pending charge at the time of their arrest on the current charge).
Note that the Non-Pending Group of defendants released on bail excludes 5 defendants
with a pending charge who were released on bail on their current charge.

ASC is the severity of the pending charge for the Pending Group and the severity of the
current charge for the Non-Pending Group. EEL, MIS, and VIOL are prior record variables
for the Pending Group at the time of their arrest on the pending charge, and hence the
pending charge is not counted as a prior arrest. The remaining variables are all
recorded at the time of the current arrest and, therefore, may be subject to error as
estimates of their values at the time of the pending charge for the Pending Group.

The data in Table 8 present a striking picture of the differences

between the two groups of defendants. The Pending group were accused
prior to their release on bail with having committed a more severe crime
(the ASC variable), had a record of more prior felony and misdemeanor
arrests, had a greater proportion of persons on parole or probation,
and had a lower average earnings than the Non-Pending group.

On the

other hand, there appear to be no statistically significant differences
between the Pending and Non-Pending group in their age, residence, previous

and current employment, and legitimate income (exclusive of earnings). Overall, these results have an important bearing on understanding the operation

of the bail system. They suggest that the variables that are statistically
significant determinants of the defendant's bond (

e.g.,

severity of

the charge and criminal record) also provide information on the likelihood

that a defendant will be charged with comitting an offense during the
period of pretrial liberty, and that the variables that are not sfgnificant
determinants of bond (

e.g.,

age, residence, other income, previous

employment) do not provide such information. One can infer, therefore, that
the reason judges use the severity of the defendant's charge and his prior
criminal record (and not the defendant's age, residence, previous employment
and other income) as a guide in setting bond is because the first set of
variables provides some information as to the likelihood that the defendant
will commit a crime during the period of pretrial liberty.

Although the data in Table 8 provide insights into identifying the
factors that predict crimes committed during the period of pretrial liberty,
the analysis of one factor at a time does not allow us to estimate the net
amount of information yielded by any one factor when all other factors are

34.

held constant. To do this we have estimated a probability function for
pretrial crimes using the maximum likelihood method previously described.
The logit specification of the probability function is the following

is the probability of committing a crime during the period of
1

th

pretrial liberty for the i— defendant (which takes the value 1 if the
defendant is in the Pending group and 0 if he is in the Non-pending group).

X, Y, Z and 0 are sets of variables defined in Table 3, although the variables included in each set (except for D) are limited to those contained in
Table 8.

Estimates of the probability function of crimes committed during the

period of pretrial liberty are presented in Table 9. Equations 9.1-9.3
are maximum likelihood Logit results where all defendants with a pending
charge are included in the Pending group; equations 9.4-9.6 are also Logit
results but the Pending group only includes defendants convicted on their
current charge; and equations 9.7-9.8 are OLS results that can be compared
to 9.3 and 9.6 respectively.

The findings in Table 9 are generally consistent with the results

in Table 8 and the bond regressions in Table 4. Both the severity of the
charge against the defendant and his criminal record (past felonies, past
misdemeanors, parole but not past violations) have significant positive
effects on the probability of committing crimes during the period of
pretrial liberty.

These findings are largely unaffected by which

defendants are included in the Pending group, and by whether Logit or OLS

techniques are used. The magnitude of the coefficients can be illustrated

in

the following examples. A defendant charged with a class C felony,

compared to one charged with a class A misdemeanor, which adds 9.4 years
to the ASC variable, has approximately a .09 greater probability of being
charged with a new crime during pretrial liberty, other things constant.

Since the mean probability of being charged is between .10 and .15, a person
accused of a class C felony has about a 60 to 90 per cent higher probability
of being arrested and charged with committing a crime during pretrial

liberty than a person initially charged with a class A misdemeanor. Alternatively, each unit increase in the severity of the initial offense raises
the odds of being charged with committing a crime during pretrial liberty

by between 7 and 11 per cent. A unit increase in past felonies raises the
probability of a pretrial crime on average by about .01 or roughly 7 to 10

per cent, or raises the odds by about 10 to 12 per cent. More strikingly,
for a defendant on parole the probability of being charged with committing
a crime during pretrial liberty rises by between .13 and .18 or more than
100 per cent and the odds increase by approximately 150 per cent.

In

sum, the results on severity of the offense and prior criminal record
strongly support the hypothesis that these variables are positively related
to the probability of committing crime during the period of pretrial liberty.
Since it has previously been shown that judges set bail according to these
same variables, we now have a powerful rationale for such procedure; namely,
that severity of the initial charge and prior record provide judges with
information on the likelihood of a defendant doing harm when released on

bail. The remaining variables in the equations are generally not significant
predictors (except for age, which is significant in 9.1 and marginally
significant in 9.2 and 9.4) of the likelihood of committing a crime during

pretrial liberty. For the residence (NYC), previous employment (PREM),

39.

other income (INC), and the type of offense variables (0), these findings
are in accord with the earlier bond regressions (that is, these variables
do not predict crimes during pretrial liberty and are not used in setting

bond). On the other hand, employment or earnings, which had negative and
significant effects on the size of bond in Table 4, have negative (as
expected) but insignificant or marginally significant effects on the
probability of committing a crime during pretrial liberty.

We emphasize,

however, that predictions about the likelihood of comitting a crime need
not be the sole criterion for setting bond. Forecasts on the severity of
the crime and the likelihood that the defendant will not appear for future
legal proceedings are also relevant.

Severity of Crime
We explore the question of severity using multiple regression analysis
in which the dependent variable is the severity of the current charge (ASC).
The sample is restricted to defendants with a pending charge (i.e.,

the

Pending Group) since we are interested in the ability to forecast the severity
of the crime committed during the period of pretrial liberty, given that a

crime has been committed. The independent variables include the same
variables used to forecast the probability of committing a crime during the

period of pretrial release. The regression equations are presented in
Table 10 where equation 10.1 includes all pending defendants and equation 10.2

includes pending defendants convicted on their current charge. The results
of the two regression equations are quite similar except for the NYC variable, which is marginally significant in 10.1 but insignificant in 10.2.
Of particular interest is the prior felony variable which is a highly signi-

ficant predictor of the severity of the offense comitted during pretrial

liberty. This result together with the finding that prior misdemeanors
is insignificant in Table 10 suggest why we observed in Table 4 that
prior felonies had a greater impact than prior misdemeanors on the

defendant's bond. Prior felonies predict both the probability and
severity of the crime during pretrial liberty while prior misdemeanors

only predict the probability. Of the two other criminal record variables,
parole is insignificant while prior violations is significant. However,
the more violations, other things the same, the less severe the crime

during pretrial liberty. This appears to run counter to the hypothesis
that the longer one's criminal record, the greater the harm from pretrial

liberty. One possible explanation is the presence of serial correlation
in the severity of crimes--that is, persons with more arrests in the past
on violations, other things constant, are more likely to be arrested for
violations in the future.

However, the type of serial correlation is

complex because the severity of pending charge (ASC) had an insignificant
though positive effect on the severity of the crime during pretrial liberty.
Thus, to the extent that serial correlation of severity exists, it does not

run strongly from the imediate past charge (pending charge) to the current
one but instead must reflect a pattern over several past offenses and the
current offense.

The effects of the socio-economic variables in Table 10 should be

viewed cautiously. As noted previously, NYC, EMP, EARN, PREM and INC are
recorded at the time of the current not the pending arrest. Employment
and earnings which had significant negative effects on the defendant's bond
have no significant effect in predicting the severity of the current
charge.

Moreover, the Logit results of Table 9 indicated that

42.

employment and earnings had no significant effects on the probability of

committing crimes during pretrial liberty. The effects of age in Table 9
and Table 10 indicate that older defendants have both a lower probability

of committing crimes and comit less severe crimes during pretrial
liberty. (The former effect is marginally significant while the latter

effect is significant.) We have no explanation for the effects of age;
however, it is apparent from the bond regressions that the information
conveyed by age is not utilized in setting bond.

The power to predict the severity of crimes using prior information

need not be confined to crimes during pretrial liberty. We can examine
all defendants in our sample and ask whether prior information forecasts

the severity of their current charge. Equation 10.3 presents the results
for defendants without a pending charge, the majority of defendants in our

sample. Here the prior criminal record variables have no significant
effects on the severity of the current charge. The only significant variable in equation 10.3 is employment which shows that employed defendants

are charged with committing less severe crimes. However, an F-test on the
entire
joint effect of the/set of independent variables leads us to accept the
null hypothesis that jointly these variables have no significant power to
predict severity.

Exactly why we have better success in forecasting

severity of crimes committed during pretrial liberty remains an interesting
puzzle.

Disappearance

The second source of harm from pretrial liberty is the disappearance

of defendants released on bail. Disappearance frustrates the criminal
proceedings against the defendant, gives released defendants added time to

43.

commit illegal acts, and generally weakens the deterrent effect of criminal

sanctions. Data are available on the disappearance of defendants released
on bail on their current charge, making it possible to test directly the
determinants of the disappearance rate.

Since the dependent variable

is dichotomous (1 if the defendant disappears and 0 if he does not ),

the

estimation technique employed is 'the maximum likelihood Logit method

described earlier.

Two questions are of interest in the analsyis of disappearance.
First, are the factors that determine the size of bond also significant

predictors of the probability of disappearance? Second, does the size of
the defendant's bond and the presence of other financial requirements
provide any deterrence to disappearing?

These two questions are interrelated. One stated purpose of the
existing bail system (and many would argue the only "legal" purpose) is
to deter disappearance by setting a money payment or bond that is forfeited

if the accused does not appear in court. In theory, the higher the bond
the greater the cost to the defendant of disappearing and hence the less

likely he will disappear. This hypothesis has been widely challenged. It
is argued that the use of professional bondsmen to post bonds for the
defendant shifts the potential financial loss to the bondsman and removes

the incentive for the defendant to appear at trial. This may be countered
by arguing that the risks of disappearance are not shifted entirely because
bondsmen require collateral and defendants are liable for the amount of the

bond if it is forfeited. Further, bondsmen have incentives to protect
their investment via the policing of defendants and informal mechanisms exist
to ensure the appearance of defendants in continual trouble with the law

44.

the prospect of not finding a bondsman in the future).

(e.g.,

Although arguments can be advanced for or against the deterrent effect
the

of bond, the question of/actual effect on disappearance remains open
because of the absence of empirical analysis.

A second purpose for

investigating the latter question is that bond and other financial factors
must be held constant in order to test the hypothesis that the severity of

offense, criminal record, etc. are predictors of disappearance. Assuming
that the size of the defendant's bond deters disappearance, the failure
to hold bond constant could lead to the conclusion that the severity of
offense and criminal record have no effect on the incentive to disappear
since whatever partial effect exists is offset by a higher bond.

where X, Y, Z and D are vectors of variables denoting severity of offense,
criminal record, socio-economic characteristics, and type of offense

respectively, and BOND, CA1 and CA2 are financial variables. The specification in equation (7) of two interaction variables,

BONDCA1 and CA1CA2,

requires some explanation. The inclusion of BONDCA1 is based on the hypothesis that the deterrent effect on disappearing of increasing the defendant's
bond will be weakened or even eliminated by giving the defendant the option

of posting a cash alternative of a given amount. Thus, in equation (7) we

magnitude as f. The interaction term CA1CA2 is simply the dollar value
of the cash alternative (since if CA2 >

0, then CA1 =

1

and if CA2 =

0,

then

the coefficient on CA1•CA2, should be negative because the

45.

greater the amount of cash required for pretrial liberty the greater the
amount lost if the defendant disappears.

Table 11 presents both Logit

and OLS estimates of the probability function of disappearance for defendants
released on bail, and Table 12 evaluates the interaction variables in the
probability function.

Tables 11 and 12 indicate thatfinancial variables have some effect in

deterring the disappearance of defendants released on bail. The only significant financial variable in the logit equation (at the .05 but not the
.025 level of significance) is the size of the defendant's bond providing
he is not given a cash alternative option. --'

Here a $100 increase in

bond is associated with a .05 reduction in the probability of disappearing
(at its mean value) or alternatively, with a 25 per cent reduction in the

odds of disappearing for released defendants. More strikingly, a $500
increase in bond reduces these odds (at their mean value) from .377 to .124
(from about 4 in 10 to slightly more than 1 in 10) or by about 67 per cent.
However, if the defendant is also given the option of a cash alternative,
increases in bond have no significant effect (as predicted) in reducing the
probability of disappearing.

The logit coefficients on the remaining

combinations of financial variables presented in Table 12 are all insignifi-

cant and less than their respective standard errors. For example, giving a
cash alternative to a defendant with a $500 bond does not significantly alter

the probability of disappearing. This is not surprising because the impact
of a $100 cash alternative should be felt primarily for large values of bond.
When bond is raised to $1500, a cash alternative of $100 substantially
increases the probability of disappearing (by .323 in Table 12) but again

this effect is not significant.-' We also find that increasing the amount

of the cash alternative has a negative though insignificant effect on the

probability of disappearing. Finally, note that Logit and OLS estimation
methods yield approximately the same results for the financial variables.

The results of Table 11 indicate that the main determinants of the
defendant's bond--the severity of the charge (ASC), prior felonies (FEL) and
parole or probation status (PAR)--are not significant predictors of the

probability of disappearing. In fact, the more severe the charge, the
greater the number of prior felonies and the more likely the defendant is
on parole, the lower the estimated probability of disappearance, other things

constant. Although none of these coefficients approach significance, their
negative signs hardly support the view that these variables are positive

predictors of disappearing. Of the other variables in Table 11 only the
presence of an outstanding detainer (DET) and resisting arrest on the current
charge (RES) were positive and significant predictors of the probability of

disappearing. In addition, both of these variables had a positive but non-

significant effect on the defendant's bond (see Table 4). One should also
point out that the coefficients on the age variable (AGE) are marginally
significant in Table 11, indicating that older defendants are less likely

to disappear. Age was also negatively related to the probability of
committing crimes during pretrial liberty and to the severity of these

crimes, though these results were significant in only a few equations. This
information, however, was not utilized in setting bond where the regression

coefficient on age was always less than its standard error. Six dummy
offense variables were included in each equation in Table 11. The coefficients
on these variables were generally insignificant but jointly they had a

significant effect on the probability of disappearing.

This contrasts

49.

with the absence of any significant joint effects of offense type in the
bond regression or in the equation on the probability and severity of
crimes during pretrial liberty.

Forecasting Harm: Some Concluding Remarks
Our empirical analysis has revealed that the main factors determining

the defendant's bond are also significant predictors of crimes comitted
during the period of pretrial liberty but that these same factors have
little power in forecasting the relatively high disappearance rate (around

30 per cent) during this period. We have reproduced in Table 13 the relevant regression and logit coefficients from the earlier tables that illustrate this important finding.

All independent variables that are included in Table 13 were statistically significant in the bond regressions, and all were entered in the

equations on pretrial harm. Four of these variables--the severity of the
initial charge, prior felony arrests, prior misdemeanor arrests, and parole
or probation status--had positive and significant effects on either the
probability (odds) that the defendant coimiits a crime during pretrial liberty

or the severity of the pretrial crime given its comission. That is, variables measuring the seriousness and extent of a defendant's criminal record
provide information on the occurence of criminal acts during pretrial liberty.
Data limitations allowed only incomplete analysis in the pretrial crime
equations of several variables included in the bond regressions.

---"

However,

the tests that were carried out suggested that the insignificant variables
in both the equations on the probability and on the severity of pretrial
crimes were also insignificant in the bond regressions.

In contrast,

none of the variables in Table 13 had any significant impact on the probability

(odds) of disappearing. The only two significant predictors of disappearance (aside from the financial variables) were the outstanding
detainer and resist arrest variables, and neither had a significant
effect on the defendant's bond.

On the basis of these results, one can infer that judges are setting
bond according to estimates of expected harm during the period of pretrial

liberty, and that they are being guided in this decision by variables that
are significant predictors of one type of harm; namely, crimes committed
during the period of pretrial liberty.

Moreover, it would not be

unreasonable to conclude that the principle social function of the existing
bail system (as it operates in New York City) is to prevent defendants from
committing additional crimes not from disappearing.

This finding is in

sharp contrast to the traditional view of bail which asserts that the sole
legal purpose of money bail is to ensure the defendant's appearance at trial
and that to use bail otherwise--that is, to prevent future criminal acts--is

a violation of the Constitution. Critics of the criminal justice system are
keenly aware of this conflict between theory and practice, and have argued
at length that the actual operation of the bail system bears only a faint

resemblence to its legal purpose. Many of these critics, however, deny that
bail serves any useful purpose because they contend that judges and other
law enforcement personnel do not have the information or skills to forecast

pretrial crimes with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Our empirical
analysis casts considerable doubt on this latter assertion.

One is tempted to ask why judges behave as if they are more concerned
with preventing defendants from committing crimes than from disappearing

during pretrial liberty. Although a comprehensive answer is beyond the scope

52.

of the present study, it is useful to speculate on possible reasons.
Prima facie there appears to be an incentive for judges not to follow the
policy outlined above because this policy is widely believed to be illegaland
unconstitutional.

Numerous scholars, public officials, appellate judges,

and various organizations including the Legal Aid Society of New York and
the Vera Institute have spoken out against the use of bail for purposes of

preventing pretrial crimes. And in at least one instance a suit was brought
challenging the constitutionality of the bail system. -'-"

In so far as

judges are responsive to the criticisms of these groups or to possible sanctions (e.g.,

suspension or dismissal) from pursuing an "illegal" bail

policy, then one is unlikely to observe the setting of bond based on estimates

of future criminal activities. On the other hand, one can point to forces
that may produce a response more consistent with our empirical findings.

For example, if a defendant comits a crime during pretrial liberty and is
apprehended, it is immediately apparent which judge was responsible for the

defendant's release. In turn, the judge may receive adverse publicity
depending on the severity of the defendant's crime, and the judiciary in
general may become the target of public criticism against a legal system

that is turning loose dangerous criminals. However, if a defendant disappears
(assuming his case has not already received a great amount of notoriety), it
is difficult to identify the judge responsible unless the defendant subsequently

commits a crime and is arrested. Obviously, the relative importance of the
opposing incentives cannot be determined a priori but requires a careful
analysis of the explicit sanctions, rates of promotions, behavior of elected
versus appointed judges, non-pecuniary benefits, etc.

S

53.

A related issue but one that is more specific to New York City is to
ask what bail policy might be expected in a community where allegedly there

is a crisis in law enforcement. Consider the following possible circumstances: crime rates are high and rising; a significant fraction of persons
who are arrested and then released on bail fail to show up voluntarily for
subsequent court appearances; only a small fraction of these defendants are
reapprehended because of the limited enforcement resources and the large
number of disappearances; defendants are rarely denied requests to delay
their case and hence are able to put off for long periods the ultimate disposition of their case; and the resources of the prosecution are so strained
by the large caseload and long delays that defendants, particularly, those
free on bail, are offered trivial sentences in exchange for pleading guilty.

One response to such a system is to punish and convict persons at the only

stage that is often possible--the stage immediately after their arrest. That
is, at the time of the defendant's arraignment, bond would be fixed at rela-

tively high levels when there is a strong presumption of factual guilt. A
higher bond would increase the likelihood of the defendant's pretrial detention, which is equivalent to immediate punishment, and would also increase
the likelihood of future punishment following the disposition of his case.
In these circumstances, bond and more generally the terms set for pretrial

release serve as indicators of the judges estimate of both the defendant's

factual guilt and the appropriate punishment. One should then observe a
significant relationship between the size of bond and both the probability

of conviction and severity of punishment, other things constant. Note that
it is not necessary that using the bail system for the purpose of punishment

54.

would generate the features of bail that we have empirically observed.
The link must be that defendants with more extensive criminal records

and

currently accused or more severe crimes are not only more likely to
commit crimes if released on bail but are also more likely to be factually

guilty.

In

the next section we attempt to gain incites, into this

question by examining the relationship between bond, pretrial detention
and the disposition of cases.

IV. THE DISPOSITION OF DEFENDANTS
In this section we analyze the empirical determinants of the dis-

position of cases. We make no attempt to examine the choice among different methods of disposition, particularly the choice between a settlement
and a trial, since all but seven defendants in our sample had their cases
disposed of without a trial.

Instead we focus on the factors determining

the sentence received by the defendant, including the important question of
the effect of pretrial status on the sentence.

There are two main hypotheses regarding the relationship between

pretrial status and the disposition of the case. The first asserts that
defendants not released on bail are, as a consequence of their detention,

more likely to be convicted and more likely to receive longer prison sen-

tences than comparable defendants released on bail. One can argue that
pretrial detention reduces the productivity of the defendants inputs into
his case (both his own time and market inputs such as the services of an

attorney). This in turn increases the probability of the defendant's conviction ii a trial, which would weaken his bargaining power, and lead him
to accept worse terms in a pretrial settlement.

S

55.

The second hypothesis and one developed in the last section is
that pretrial detention is the result of a greater probability of con-

viction adjusted for the severity of the offense. This is because judges
supposedly use the setting of bond and other terms of pretrial release as

a mecnanism for punishing defendants whom they believe are more likely
to be convicted and to receive jail sentences. According to this hypothesis
a finding of a positive relationship between detention and the severity
of the sentence is expected; however, this would indicate that the sentence
and not pretrial detention was the causal factor.

One can distinguish empirically between these two hypotheses by
including as independent variables both the defendant's bond and his pre-

trial status in a regression equation on the defendant's sentence. If
the second hypothesis is correct, one should observe a positive coefficient
on the bond variable since the amount of bond incorporates information on
the probability of conviction adjusted for the severity of the offense.

If one still finds a negative effect of detention on the sentence with bond
entered in the equation, this would then support the hypothesis that pretrial
detention had an independent adverse effect on the defendant's sentence.

Stated differently, if the regression were to exclude the defendant's bond,
then the coefficient on the bail variable would be measuring both the effect
of pretrial detention and the effect of prior information on the expected
sentence (since the greater the bond, the greater the likelihood of pretrial
detention).

Formally, we have the following recursive system of equations.

56.

BOND=cL0+ct1X+c2y+ct3Z+u

SENT =

o

+ 1B0ND
+ X2BOND

+

+ u2

(8)

(9)

+ A3X + A4Y + A5Z +
u3

(10)

In equation (8) BOND is a positive function of the severity of the offense

(the X vector), prior record (the V vector) and socio-economjc characteristics

(the Z vector). We have argued and provided substantial empirical evidence
that the X and V variables affect BOND because (a) judges set bond according
to estimates of pretrial harm and (b) X and V provide such information.

We

are now hypothesizing that BOND also includes predictions about the defendant's
expected penalty. This expected penalty is in part related to the X and .V
variables; however, the residual, u1, also contains such information-—pre-

sumably the greater the value of U1, the greater the expected penalty other

things constant. In equation (9), the defendant's pretrial status, denoted
by BAIL (which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the defendant is released
and 0 if he is detained), is determined by the size of BOND (or, more generally,
the terms of pretrial release) by the socio-economic variables.

The

sentence variable in turn is affected by pretrial status, plus information
on the expected outcome (contained in the BOND variable), plus any additional

effects due to the X, V and Z vectors of variables. The failure to include
the BOND variable in equation (10) would mean that BAIL would pick up the
influence of BOND since u1 is assumed to be positively correlated with the
expected sentence and defendants released on bail are more likely to have
negative u11s.

Table 14 presents the regression estimates of equation (10). The

.

57.

dependent variable in all equations is the defendant's sentence (SENT),
which ranges from zero in the event of a dismissal or probation to 15

years (though only 18 defendants received sentences in excess of 1 year).1
The definitions of all independent variables are given in Table 3.

The most striking result in Table 14 is the positive and highly

significant effect of the defendant's bond on his sentence. The importance
of this effect is illustrated in the following examples. At the mean values
of the other independent variables, a $0 bond is associated with an average
sentence of about 21 days, a $500 bond with a sentence of 56 days, a $1500
bond with a sentence of 125 days, and a $2000 bond with a sentence of about

1 year. Since less than 3 per cent of our sample have sentences in excess
of 1 year, it follows that variations in bond (within the range in which
bond is set) can account for a large fraction of the average differences in

sentences among defendants. These findings provide strong support for the
hypothesis that at the initial stages of the criminal proceedings, judges
are setting bond, in part, according to forecasts of the defendant's sentence.

Thus, defendants likely to receive major penalties because they are accused

of severe offenses or have lengthy prior records will have relatively high
bonds and ten.! to be detained. In contrast, defendants likely to receive
minor sentences if convicted will have relatively low bonds and tend to be
released.

How does one interpret these empirical findings? We speculated

at the end of Section iii on the possible adaptation of a criminal justice
system to a situation where disappearance rates are relatively high and

resources for reapprehension are severely limited. In these circumstances
the determination of bond becomes the vehicle for effecting punishment because

if the accused is released at this time, punishment becomes a remote possibility.!5"

This interpretation is clearly consistent with our empirical evidence.
It is more difficult to generalize on the effects of pretrial

status. In equations 14.1, 14.3 and 14.4 there is no significant difference
between the sentence of released and detained defendants, holding constant
the other variables. --'

In

equation 14.2, we observe a significant positive

effect of pretrial detention on the sentence (

i.e.,

a significant negative

coefficient on BAIL) but this is due to the deletion of the bond variable.

Once the latter is entered, as in equations 14.1, 14.3 or 14.4, the signifi-

cance of pretrial status is eliminated. On the other hand, equations 14.6
and 14.7 yield a different interpretation. In these equations the dichotomous
bail variable was replaced by two pretrial status variables; DAYS-i and DAYS-2

which are defined respectively as the number of days from arrest to disposition of the case for detained and for released defendants.

(The means

of these variables are 29 and 62 days respectively.) If pretrial detention
has an adverse effect on the outcome, one might expect that the greater the
amount of detention, as measured by days detained, the greater the defendant's

sentence. Alternatively, there is no compelling reason to expect a relation
between days at liberty (DAYS-2) and the sentence (assuming a disposition

of the case). This is precisely our findings in equations 14.6 and 14.7.
Although BOND continues to be the dominating variable, DAYS-i has a positive
and highly significant effect on the sentence, indicating that the greater
the length of pretrial detention, other things constant, the more severe the
sentence.

In contrast, DAYS-2 is marginally significant and of smaller

magnitude than DAYS-i. Pretrial detention, therefore, has an independent
and adverse effect on the defendant's sentence but this is only observable
when one differentiates according to the length of detention.

61.

We can sumarize the results of the other independent variables
in Table 14.

(1) The severity of the charge (ASC), which is measured by

the statutory penalty of the offense, has a significant positive effect
on the sentence though the effect is diminished (as expected) by inc-luding

eight dumy offense variables in 14.4 and 14.7. -- The coefficients
on ASC indicate that, other things constant, each year of a statutory penalty
is associated with between 8 and 22 days of sentence, or a ratio of statutory
penalty to sentence of between 43 and 17 to 1

This understates the total

effect of statutory penalties because we have shown in Table 4 that severity
is a significant determinant of the defendant's bond which in turn affects

the sentence. The total effect of ASC must include the indirect effect
operating through the defendant's bond. 7_91 (2) Of the other variables in
the severity of offense group (CON, WPN, INJ and RES), only an injury to
a complaining witness (INJ) has a significant positive impact on the sentence,

and this effect is substantial. For example, a serious injury produces a
direct effect on average of about 114 days plus an indirecteffect via
bond of between 36 and 55 days.

(3) Since prior felonies, misdemeanors

and parole or probation status are insignificant in Table 14, they only

effect the sentence indirectly via bond. These indirect effects are weak
for prior felonies and misdemeanors; for example, an additional prior felony

arrest adds about 7 days to the sentence. The indirect effect of a defendant
on parole or probation is about 45 additional days of sentence. The pending
variable is significant and positive in equations 14.1-14.4, adding between
70 and 100 days to one's sentence, but insignificant when dismissals are

excluded in equations 14.5 to 14.7. Thus the significance of a pending charge

.

62.

in Table 14 is due to its role in reducing the likelihood of a dismissal.

The estimated indirect effect of a pending charge is about 40 days.

(4)

All socio-economic variables have standard errors that are greater than
their regression coefficients in Table 14 and hence are insignificant

direct determinants of the sentence. Emplyment or legal earnings, however,
will affect the defendants sentence via their influence in reducing bond.
(5) The dummy offense variables, entered in 14.4 and 14.7, are jointly insignificant, indicating that the type of offense (given information on bond,

severity of offense, etc.) is not a statistically significant factor in
determining the defendant's sentence.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
At the outset we remarked on the widely held belief that the current
operation of the criminal justice system is capricious and nearly random.
According to this position, for example, the determination of bail and the
disposition of cases would largely be the product of the whim of judges and
others, and would not be systematically related to the nature and circum-

stances of the defendant's offense or his prior criminal record. This view
is at variance with our analysis. The two major empirical findings of this
study may be summarized as follows.

1. The defendant's bond and more generally the terms of his pretrial
release were strongly influenced by various measures of the severity of the

defendant's offense and his prior criminal record. Thus, the more severe
the defendant's offense and the more extensive his criminal record, the
greater the size of his bond and the lower the probability of his pretrial

release. Severity and prior record were, in turn, significant predictors

63.

of crimes committed during the period of pretrial liberty but had little
power in forecasting the relatively high disappearance rate (around 30

per cent) of released defendants. On the basis of these results it is
not unreasonable to infer that the rationale for utilizing severity and
prior record variables in setting bond is that these variables provide
information on the expected harm from pretrial liberty where harm is
measured by additional crimes.

2. The major determinant of the defendant's sentence was the size
of his bond. Our explanation for this finding is that at the time bond is
set judges are forecasting the likelihood of the defendant's conviction

and the appropriate punishment. The forecast is then incorporated into the
bail setting process by setting bond at relatively higher values for
persons expected to receive more severe sentences, and setting bond
at relatively lower values for persons likely to receive negligible

sentences. We also observed that pretrial detention, as measured by days
of detention, had an independent adverse effect on the sentence, though
the dominating factor on the sentence was always the defendant's bond.

Are the above findings incompatible? On the one hand, bond incorporates
information on the probability of pretrial crimes, and on the other, bond

provides an estimate of the defendant's sentence. However, in a criminal
justice system where disappearance rates are relatively high for released
defendants and where limited resources inhibit the reapprehension of
defendants who disappear, punishment is only possible at the time of the
arraignmen; when bond is being set and the defendant is in the custody of

the state. In these circumstances, setting bond according to the severity

.

64.

of the offense and prior record allows one to "kill two birds with one

stone." A high bond serves the joint purpose of preventing pretrial
crimes by detaining persons with higher probabilities of conilnitting

these crimes and of incarcerating persons most likely to receive jail
sentences on their current offense.

The use of the phrase "Legality and Reality" in the title of this

paper should by now be apparent. The observed manner in which the bail
setting process operates in New York City conflicts with the overwhelming

view of the legal purpose of bail. To argue further that the bail setting
process is capricious and serves no social purpose, however, is contrary
to the evidence presented in this study.

The sample was developed by the Society not for the purposes of

The Society filed a brief [Brief for Appellee, Bellamy v. Abruczo
(N.Y. Sup. Ct., March 1972)1 challenging the constitutionality of
New York's bail system, and supported their challenge with extensive statistical analysis based on the sample.

There is one important exception. If a defendant disappeared and
had not been reapprehended by the end of 1971, he was also placed
in the closed files. This case is "completedt' in the sense that the

defendant has disappeared. We should point out that 133 defendants
disappeared but only 95 disappeared who were released on bail. One
might wonder how a defendant can disappear if he is not released on

bail. Legal Aid attorneys have indicated to me that this is not so
puzzling. Correction records are manually kept, records get misplaced, several defendants my have the same name (real or aliases),
etc. The net effect is that a jailed defendant may not be located
at the time of a scheduled court appearance. If he is not found
shortly, he will be coded as having disappeared. Eventually, one
hopes he will be found (that is, "reapprehended" by the Correction

Department). The following quote from the N.Y. Times (October 5,
1973 on p. 35 under "Metropolitan Briefs") is illustrative: "Justice
Leff declared a mistrial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, blaming
the Correction Department for failing to deliver one of three defendants
in a robbery trial.

Leff said, 'I haven't the vaguest

which represents 78 per cent of the cases filed in N.Y. C. Criminal
Court. This figure overstates the number of completed cases by the
Society since in some cases private counsel replaces Legal Aid counsel.

(Based on a random sample of 423 cases of the Society's closed files,
private counsel replaced Legal Aid in 12 per cent of the cases.)

Assuming a 12 per cent replacement rate would reduce the per cent of
cases handled by Legal Aid to 69 per cent.

6.

The major discrepency between the sample and all New York defendants
is that the former has a higher rate of guilty pleas and a lower rate

of dismissals than the latter. This is probably explained by the fact
that the N.Y. County and City data also include cases disposed of at
the arraignment which tend to have a high rate of dismissals because
of early decisions to drop prosecution when complaining witnesses do

not show up or when the initial evidence appears inadequate. As indicated, the Legal Aid data exclude cases disposed at the arraignment.
One should also note the slightly higher rate of disappearances in N.Y.

County compared to our sample (23 compared to 19 per cent). This is
expected since disappearances in N.Y. County are estimated by warrants

issued after a defendant fails to appear. Since some of these defendants
may subsequently reappear after the warrant is issued, the actual

number of disappearances will be lower. A defendant is not counted as
having disappeared in the Legal Aid sample if he reappears (before the
end of 1971) after a warrant is issued on his initial disappearance.

4. F

6. continued
Finally, note that the counties of New York City are not entirely

homogeneous. For example, the disappearance rate in New York City
is 31 per cent compared to 23 per cent for Manhattan. This is due
to a 46 per cent disappearance rate in Brooklyn (

7.

i.e.,

Kings County).

The classification of offenses is generally based on the classification

given in the N.Y. Penal Code. To limit the number of classes and
to limit the number of defendants placed in the "other" category, we
classified whenever possible a defendant into one of the eight categories.

For example, the assault class includes defendants accused of menacing

and reckless endangerment, and the burglary class includes persor
arrested for possession of burglary tools and criminal trespass. The
category ot other offenses in Table 3 is a catch-all that includes

among others: disorderly conduct, loitering, bribery, homicide (one
defendant) and certain motor vehicle offenses such as unlicensed
operation of vehicles and leaving the scene of an accident.

8.

This hypothesis is derivable from an optimal bail system--one in
which the number of defendants released is determined according to the

criterion of maximizing a net benefit function from re1eae (see Landes,
"The Bail System: An Economic Approach," p.. cit., particularly pp.
88-89). An increase in expected harm increases the marginal costs of
release which in turn leads to a higher equilibrium price for release

and a reduction in the probability of release. Harm may be broadly
defined to include predictions about crimes committed by a defendant

5. F

8. continued

during the period of pretrial liberty and the likelihood the
defendant will disappear and thus frustrate the criminal proceedings

against him. There is much disagreement over whether it is a violation of the Constitution for the first of these factors, predictions
about future crimes, to enter the bail setting process. However, the

sub rosa practice of setting high bail as a means of detaining defendants believed to be dangerous is widely acknowledged.

9.

Any index of severity is bound to be somewhat arbitrary because of

the selection of weights. For this reason we experimented with another
index--felony A equaled 8, felony B equaled 7 and so forth. The use
of the latter as an index of severity instead of the one based on
statutory penalties (the ASC variable) did not alter the results of

our empirical analysis. A further difficulty with using ASC as an
estimate of the offense is that some discretion is given to the authori-

ties in determining the formal charge. For example, suppose two defendants commit identical offenses but the evidence against the first is

stronger than against the second. If expectations about convictions
are taken into account in fixing the formal charge, the first defendant
may be charged with a more serious offense than the second.

10. Of course, the greater the injury to the victim, the more probable the
formal charge will be adjusted upward. However, a given offense in the
penal code need not specify the exact degree of injury and hence a
range of injuries is consistent with a given formal charge.

6. F

11.

The resist arrest variable has a more obvious direct relation to

expected harm and hence the size of bond. Assuming a positive correlation between current and future behavior, a defendant who resists
arrest today will have greater expected costs of reapprehension if

released on bail. And an optimal bail model predicts that the higher
the costs of release, the greater the bond.

12.

It can be argued that the promise of a low bond and hence a greater
likelihood of release is used as a method of inducing the defendant

to confess. If this were the case, a negative relationship between
CON and BOND would be observed in the regression equation. Alternatively, it can be argued that a positive relationship would be observed
because a confession indicates that the defendant's guilt has for all

practical purposes been established and hence there is no reason to

release him prior to the formal adjudication of his case. It is in
the latter sense (i.e.,

confession indicates the defendant actually

committed the offense) that the confession variable belongs in the
severity of offense category.

13.

If the Z variables are in fact negatively related to the probability
of disappearing and hence the expected costs of reapprehension, then
Z and BOND would be inversely related in an optimal bail system

7. F

14.

95 defendants had to be deleted from the sample when all variables
were entered because no information was available on one or more of

these variables for each of the 95 defendants. The variable that
resulted in the deletion of the most defenddnts was the employment

or earnings variable which was missing for 77 observations. (Note
that if employment was known earnings were generally reported; however, when a person was employed but earnings were not reported, we

assigned the mean value to earnings for that observation.) To test
if the deletion of 95 observations with missing values systematically
altered the regression results we reestimated equation 4.1 using the

smaller set of observations. This is equation 4.2 in Table 4. A comparison between 4.1 and 4.2 reveals no significant differences. We
should also point out that 254 out of 860 defendants had a zero bond
(that is, these defendants were released on their own recognizance).

When a sizable fraction of the sample has a zero valued dependent vari-

able, the regression coefficients may be biased toward zero. However,
a comparison of regressions where the zero bond defendants were deleted
(these regressions are not included in the tables of the text) with
regressions that included this group showed no important differences.

15.

The differences in the regression coefficients on the felony and misdemeanor
variables are statistically significant in the equations in Table 4.
The t-statistics on these differences are in the range of 5.0.

8. F

16.

Data were also available on the number of felony arrests within 12
months of the current arrest, and the number that occurred more than

12 months before the current arrest. (FEL variable is the sum of the
two numbers.) Similarly, misdemeanors and violations can be broken
down in this manner. One can then test the hypothesis that greater
importance is attached to more immediate arrests. This was done by
defining 4 criminal record variables (FEL1=felony arrests within the
last 12 months, EEL2 =

misdemeanors

felony

arrests more than 12 months ago, M-V1 =

plus violations within the last 12 months, M-V2 =

mis-

demeanors plus violations more than 12 months ago), and then reestimating equation 4.4 using these four variables instead of FEL, MIS, and

VIOL. The regression coefficients and t-values (in parentheses) were
as follows:
FEL1

FEL2

3.37 (2.8)
.84 (3.6)

M—V1

M—V2

.41 (.82)
.26 (1.8)

(We do not present the regression coefficients and t-values of the

remaining variables in equation 4.4 since they were unaffected by this

substitution.) These results suggest that not only are prior arrests,
particularly felony arrests, important determinants of bond but that
greater weight is given to more recent arrests in forecasting harm from

pretrial liberty. The difference between the regression coefficients
on FEL1 and EEL2 is substantial (that is, a recent felony arrest adds
$337 to the defendant's bond while a past felony arrest adds $84) and

statistically significant. The difference between M-V1 and M-V2 though
positive is not statistically significant.

9. F

17.

One can get a rough notion of the source of the outstanding detainer

.

by examining the proportion of defendants with detainers who are on

parole and who have pending cases, and compare these proportions with

the respective categories for all other defendants. The results below
indicate that defendants with detainers are heavily represented in the

parole and pending groups. For example, 23 per cent of defendants with
detainers also have a pending charge whereas only 4 per cent of defendants
without detainers have a pending charge, and 14 per cent with detainers
are on parole while only 4 per cent without detainers are on parole.

In our sample, the current charge is never bail jumping for defendants
with a pending charge.

19.

A difficulty with statistically testing the effect of a pending charge

on bond is the result of a se1tctivity bias in our sample. Certain
characteristics of defendants on which data are not available (for example,
the defendant's physical appearance, attitude, race, etc.) may result

in the setting of a lower bond, raising the likelihood of the defendant's

release. The fact that a defendant was released on bail on the earlier
pending charge indicates that he probably possessed some of these favor-

able characteristics. If he still possesses them, this would operate
to reduce the bond on the current charge (adjusting for the increase

in his prior record). Hence, the pending variable could have an offsetting negative impact on bond.

.

10. F

20.

Although we find statistically significant effects on bond of the
severity of offense and prior record variables, one might take the
view that our analysis is deficient because we have only explained
about 25 per cent of the variance (see the R2's, in Table 4) in bond.
However, it is not obvious that an R2 of 25 per cent is not "high"

given the nature of the dependent variable. Although bond in principle
is a continuous variable, it tends in practice to be fixed at intervals

of $500. In our sample (see Table 5) we observe that 253 defendants
had bond set at $0, 20 had bond between $20 and *300, 257 had bond of
$500, 131 had bond of $1,000,

56 had bond of $1,500, and so forth.

With this distribution, in which the authorities do not make continuous
and fine adjustments in the size of bond, we will tend to find sizeable

residuals of predicted around actual values. This is reinforced by
the use of a large numLer of independent variables in our regression
equations which make it more likely that we will predict a continuous
distribution of bond values.

21

When both the earnings and employment variables are entered in the
same equation, neither is significant though both have a negative

sign. The correlation coefficient between earnings and employed is .47.

22.

The F-ratio is 1.33 (with 8 and 739 degrees of freedom) which does not

approach a conventional definition of significance. This nonsignificance
is due in part to the fact that the everity of the charge variable
(ASC) already incorporates information on the offense category. For
example, robbery is eitherclass B, C or D felony with 52 per cent of

11. F

22 continued

robbery defendants accused of a class B felony. Larceny defendants
are about equally divided between a misdemeanor A and a felony E.

Hence, a defendant accused of robbery will have a greater value for
the ASC variable than a defendant accused of larceny. The association
between the offense classes and the ASC variable can be tested by
estimating an auxiliary regression of ASC on the eight dummy variables.

This is presented below where D1 =
D4 =

robbery,

D8 =

other,

D5 =

stolen

assault,

burglary,

D3 =

larceny,

property, D6 = dangerous weapon, D7 =

forgery,

and the left out variable (

D2 =

i.e.,

the constant in the

regression) is drugs.

The above regression indicates that 43 per cent of the variation in ASC

is explained by the offense category of the defendant. A comparison
of the regression equations 4.4 and 4.5 show that the main effect of
introducing the eight offense variables is (as expected) to reduce the
t-value of the ASC variable by about 30 per cent.

liberty and the amount he is willing to pay for pretrial liberty see

Defendants are generally released on bail within a few days of their

arrest. In our sample, 321 defendants were released within two days
of their arrest and the remaining 12 were released within seven days
of the arrest.

See M. Nerlove and S. J. Press, "Notes on the Log-Linear or Logistic
Model for the Analysis of Qualitative Socio-Economic Data," mimeographed
August 23, 1972, for a systematic presentation of the logit model and
an analysis of the problems associated with ordinary least squares

estimation of a dumy dependent variable. Basically, the m4ximim
likelihood method of estimating the logit model is as follows. Arrange
the defendants so that the first n' defendants are released and the
last n-n' defendants are detained, and then write the logarithmic likelihood function as
n

where r is specified as in (3). The log likelihood function is then

maximized with respect to

and l This yields a system of non-linear

equations from which estimates of

and the vector l can be obtained

by iterative procedures.

26.

Defendants with a $0 bond have a probability of release equal to 1,
and are,therefore, excluded from the estimation of the probability
function.

Note that the dollar value of the cash alternative enters as the interaction term CA1.CA2.

That is, log(PI(l_P))/ BOND or Pr/aBOND given that CA1 =

not be significantly different than zero. The specification in (6)

defmes alog(P/(l_P))/3BOND as equal to 1+f33CA1, and 3Pr/BOND

as equal to (i+3CAl)(Pr(l_Pr))

13. F

29.

The socio-economjc variables (EMP, EARN, INC, and PREM in Table 3)

do not fully measure opportunity cost and wealth because among other

things, they exclude earnings and wealth from illegal sources. The
defendant's age (AGE) and residence (NYC) are also included as
explanatory variables because both may indirectly reflect the defendant's access to assets for financing release and the willingness of

bondsmen to post bond. For example, if it is less costly for bondsmen
to supervise defendants living in New York City than those outside the
City, posting bond for the former compared to the latter should lower

the bondsman's risk of forfeiture of the bail bond. The predicted

effect of age on making bail is uncertain. Although younger persons
generally have fewer assets, they may have greater access to assets
of parents.

.
30

The x2 statistic (with 5 d.f.) on the joint effect of the socio-

economic variables is 2.72. Note that earnings was also insignificant
when it was entered !n the logit equation in place of the employment
van able.

31.

This explanation is still consistent with using earnings or employment
in setting bond (as was observed in Table 4) because judges may view
only legal sources o1 income as indicators of one's attachment to the
community.

.

14. F
32.

If this data were available, we could directly test whether the
charact2ristics of persons with respect to prior criminal record
(i.e.,

prior to current charge), severity of current offense, etc.

differed between defendants who were and were not subsequently con-

victed of crimes comitted during the period of pretrial liberty.
Even this data would be flawed because some offenders would not be
caught and some convicted offenders may not have committed the alleged

offense. Another possible and more subtle difficulty with such data,
if it were available, is the following. Assume that prior criminal
record and certain unmeasured (in our empirical analysis) characteristics of defendants are .ignificant predictors ot the likelihood

of committing crimes during the period of pretrial release. Let
judges be aware of these facts and let them set bond according to the

defendant's record and these unmeasured characteristics. Defendants
with both an extensive criminal record and adverse characteristics
will have a high bond set and hence few or none of them will be released.
Defendants with a similar criminal record but favorable characteristics

will have a low or zero bond set and will be released. Hence, a sample

of r&eased defendants will contain some defendants with a long
criminal record and some with no or an insignificant criminal record.

However, the former group will contain primarily those with favorable
unmeasured characteristics (since those with unfavorable characteristics
will tend to be detained) while the latter group will have both defen-

dants with favorable and unfavorable unmeasured characteristics. Consequently, we may observe no significant difference in the propensity

to comit crimes during pretrial liberty between the two groups because
we are not holding constant an important variable (i.e.,

the unmea-

sured characteristics). Note that if we still found a significant effect

15. F

32 continued
of prior record on crimes committed during the period of pretrial

release, then we would have found an even stronger effect if the
unmeasured characteristics were held constant.

33.

None of these defendants were rearrested solely on the basis of a
bail violation (for example, 'jumping bail") on their pending charge.

A bail violation may have been one of the charges against the defendant

but it was not the most severe charge. The latter charge for all
defendants in the sample involved a new criminal offense.

34.

Comparisons between the Pending and Non-Pending groups will tend to
understate the power of variables to forecast crimes during the period

of pretrial liberty for two reasons. (1) We are assuming (incorrectly)
that the Non-Pending group is equivalent to the group of released

defendants who do not commit crimes during their period of pretrial

liberty. Undoubtedly, the Non-Pending group includes some defendants
who will in fact commit crimes during the period of pretrial release.
This means that if defendants in the Pending group have on average
significantly longer criminal records than those in the Non-Pending
group, then we also expect the likelihood of committing crimes during
the period of pretrial liberty among defendants within the Non-Pending

group to bc greater the longer their criminal record. Hence, the
observed difference in the average criminal record between the Pending
and Non-Pending group should be smaller than the difference between the
Pending ind a subset of the Non-Pending group, namely, those who do not

commit crimes while released on bail. (2) Defendants released on bail

16. F
34 continued

with long criminal records will tend to have other unmeasured characteristics that are favorable to low bond (otherwise it is unlikely
they would be released) and these characteristics may be correlated
with a low probability of committing crimes during pretrial liberty.
(See footnote 32 for a more complete explanation of this point.)
One can roughly estimate the per cent of defendants in the Non-

Pending group who will in fact be subsequently rearrested and charged

wiLh committing a crime during the period of pretrial liberty. This
can be illustrated by the following hypothetical figures. Suppose in
period 1, 1000 persons are arrested and 400 are released on bail, and
further assume that it takes one period to dispose of a case through

the legal system. In period 2, 1000 persons are also arrested of whom
100 have pending charges against them, and again 400 are released on

bail (though no one with a pending charge is released). Let these
same figures persist in the future--1000 arrested, 400 released and

100 with pending charges. Since all cases are disposed of within one
period, there are at most 400 persons at any moment in time who could

commit an offense n bail. The number arrested and accused of committing
an offense while released is 100, or 25 per cent of those reieased
(which is equal to the ratio of pending to released in any one period).

The use of the latter ratio as an estimate of the proportion of those
released who commit a crime during the period of release would be less
accurate if there were changes over time in some of the variables assumed

constant. In our sample there are 328 defendants without a pending
charge who are released on bail (

i.e.,

the Non-Pending group) and

59 defendants with a pending charge. Thus, 18 per cent is a crude estimate

of the proportion released who will be charged with comitting a crime
during the period of pretrial

liberty.

17. F

35.

There were no data for the pending offense on the following variables:

bond, confession prior to setting bond; possession of a dangerous
weapon; injury to complaining witness; whether the defendant forcibly
resisted arrest; and whether there existed an outstanding detainer.

Note that it would be highly misleading to use the detainer variable
at the time of the current charge because it may have been issued

precisely because the defendant had a pending charge and committed
a bail violation (e.g.,

jumping bail) during the period of

pretrial liberty.

36.

The parole and probation variable should be treated with caution since
it is possible that some defendants with a pending charge may have been
recorded on parole or probation (at the time of the current charge)
precisely because they had a pending charge.

37.

As noted earlier, the earnings and employment variables, which were
recorded at the time of the current arrest, may have changed for the
Pending group between the time of their pending and current charges.

Moreover, the change need not be random since employment and earnings

may be adversely affected by the presence of a pending charge. Thus,
the statistically significant difference between the Pending and NonPending groups for earnings and the marginal significance for employment may be spurious in the sense that they do not accurately reflect
differences in these variables between the Pending group at the time
the pending charge occurred and the Non-Pending group.

.

18. F

38.

Equation 9.1 differs from 9.2 and 9.3 because 30 observations had to
be eliminated from the latter two equations to add the parole and

the socio-economic variables. For an identical reason, equations
9.5 and 9.6 contain 27 fewer observations than 9.4.

39.

The coefficient on past felonies is significant at the .05 level
in equation 9.1 but its significance diminishes to .10 (in a one-tail

test) in the remaining Logit equations. Moreover, the magnitude of the
coefficients on past felonies are less than on past misdemeanors which
suggests (surprisingly) that the latter has a bigger impact than the
former on the probability of committing a crime during the period of

pretrial liberty. One should not conclude, however, that greater weight
should be attached to past misdemeanors than past felonies in setting
bond since we have not yet examined the relationship between these

criminal record variables and the severity of the offense committed
during the period of pretrial liberty and the probability of disappearance.

40.

This result should be interpreted with caution as indicated earlier
in footnote 36.

41.

The equations with earnings substituted for employment are not repro-

duced in Table 9. The coefficients and t-ratios (in parentheses) on
earnings using the specification of equation 9.3 was -.003 (.81) and

using the specification of equation 9.6 was -.006 (1.44). The remaining
coefficients in these equations were virtually unchanged.

19. F

42.

This argument would also be applicable to our finding that past
misdemeanors have an insignificant effect on the severity of the
current charge.

43.

The regression results on earnings (EARN) are not presented in

Table 10. When EARN was substituted for EMP in 10.1 and 10.3, it
was

insignificant.

44.

The F-statistic is .90 with 9 and 706 degrees of freedom.

45.

This was not possible in the analysis of crimes during the period
of pretrial liberty because data were unavailable on which defendants

released on bail on their current offense comitted crimes.

46.

If judges anticipate higher probabilities of disappearance and set

bond accordingly, the empirical analysis is further complicated because
the deterrent effect of bond may not be observable in a single equation

model. That is, a higher propensity to disappear for a released defendant will be associated with a higher bond which in turn will offset

the higher propensity. Therefore, one might observe identical probabilities of disappearance across defendants with different size bonds.
We attempt to deal with this problem by holding constant variables
likely to be associated with higher propensities to disappear
(e.g.,

severity of offense and criminal record variables) when

estimating the effect of bond and other financial variables on the
probability of disappearance.

20. F

47.

There is an additional complication in estimating the partial effect
of criminal record, etc. on disappearance that has already been discussed in connection with the commission of crimes during pretrial

liberty (see footnote 32). For example, a defendant with a longer
criminal record, holding constant bond and the remaining measured
variables, would tend to have other (nonmeasured) characteristics that
lead to the setting of a lower bond compared to a defendant with a

shorter record. Assuming that the characteristics that reduce bond
are favorable to appearing for court hearings, etc., then we may
observe no significant positive effect of criminal record on disappearance
(because of our failure to hold nonmeasurable characteristics constant)

even though the true effect is positive. This means our empirical
analysis will be biased against finding a significant positive effect
of the criminal record variables, etc.on disappearance even though bond is

held constant. Put differently, if the bail system is operating efficiently in the sense that judges are utilizing available information on
the likelihood of disappearance to set bond, then defendants with long
prior records who are released will primarily be those with other
characteristics (that we cannot measure) that reduce the likelihood of

disappearance. On the other hand, if judges are making "mistakes",
then we should be able to pick out a positive effect of criminal record
in the empirical analysis once bond is held constant because a longer
criminal record will not be associated with favorable characteristics

but rather with a "mistake" in setting bond. Indirect support for the
latter interpretation comes from our findings on pretrial crimes. If

21. F

47 continued
released persons with extensive prior records, etc. had some unmeasured
favorable characteristics that reduce the probability of disappearing,
we might also expect these characteristics to be associated with the

absence of pretrial crimes. The latter hypothesis, however is not
consistent with our empirical findings. In order to still advance
the favorable characteristics hypothesis, one would then have to

argue that these characteristics provide asymetrical information (i.e.,
they are associated with less disappearances but not with less

pretrial crimes). Without further evidence on the content of these
unmeasured characteristics, this would be a highly tenuous argument.

A couparison of disappearance rates in relation to bond shows disappearance rates of 12.5 per cent (10/80) for defendants with a
positive bond or cash alternative and 33.5 per cent (85/253) for

defendants with a zero bond. Thus the ROR group (that is, released
on their own recognizance) had nearly 3 times the rate of disappearances

as the non-ROR group. Note that this comparison is for all 333
released defendants while the equations in Table 11 exclude 26 of
these persons because of missing information on one or more independent
variables.

22. F

50.

That is, one accepts the null hypothesis that

+

in

equation (7).

51.

Part of the reason for an insignificant effect of a cash alternative

option is that the computation of the standard error of Pd/CAl (or
3log(Pd(l_Pd)/CAl) involves the standard error of

in equation (7)

weighted by bond-squared. Although the bond values used in Table 12
are moderate, they are still far greater than the mean bond in the
sample of released defendants (about $140) because about 75 per cent
of the latter are released on their own recognizance (that is, a $0

bond). Hence, the reliability of estimates of Pd/3CAl tend to be weak
for values of bond that greatly exceed the mean value in the sample.
Alternatively, if we were to use a lower value for bond in our computation, then the operational distinction between a bond and cash
alternative would be destroyed, and in this instance aPd/3CA1 would
also be insignificant.

52.

At the .05 level of significance (in a two-tail test) only the "other"

offense class was significant in equations 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3. In
both equations 11.1 and 11.2 the

statistic on the joint effect of

the dumy offense variables was significant at the .01 level.

In

equation 11.3 the F-ratio on the offense variables was significant
at the .05 but not the .01 level.

23. F

53.

The following variables were not included in the probability of
pretrial crimes or severity equations because of the absence of

data: confession, possession of a dangerous weapon, resist arrest,
injury to a complaining witness, outstanding detainer and the amount

of bond on the pending charge. Note that the injury variable was
significant in the bond regressions. Further, the parole, residence,
employment, earnings, other income and age variables are subject to
inaccuracies because they were recorded at the time of the current
and not the pending arrest.. Finally, the pending charge variable,

which was an important determinant of bond, cannot be included in the

probability or severity equations because a crime comitted during
pretrial liberty is measured by the presence of a pending charge.

54.

Two exceptions should be noted. First, as indicated, employment and
earnings are significant variables in the bond regression but were
not related to either crimes during pretrial liberty or disappearing.
Thus, the purpose of setting a lower bond in response to legal employ-

ment and earnings remains unclear. Secondly, age was inversely related
to all measures of harm (though in most cases the relationship was
marginally significant) but was not used in setting bond.

55.

Although we have shown that increasing the size of bond and withholding
the option of a cash alternative has some deterrent effect on the
probability of disappearing for a defendant released on bail, the
important point is that judges are setting bond based on variables that

forecast crimes and not disappearance. Put differently, reducing the

55 continued
rate of disappearance by setting more difficult terms for pretrial

release may still be a goal of the bail system but according to our
well

empirical results this goal would be equally/served by setting bond

randomly among defendants. One rationale of setting bond on the
basis of the severity and extent of one's prior record is to prevent
defendants with greater probabilities of committing crimes from

obtaining pretrial liberty. Note that one can never totally reject
the hypothesis that judges are attempting to forecast the probability
of disappearance in setting bond since it is conceivable that they
are attempting to do so but are unsuccessful in their efforts.

56.

It must be noted that our empirical findings are not intended as either

an indictment or defense of the existing bail system. We have quantified certain statistical relationships between bail setting and pretrial harm, but have not attempted to measure the social costs of
operating the bail system in comparison to the gains from preventing

pretrial crimes. For example, although the factors used in setting
bond also predict pretrial crime, they may be subject to considerable

error. Thus, detained defendants may have higher probabilities of
committing crimes during pretrial liberty than those not released,

and yet a majority of those detained may not commit any crime had they

been released. Moreover, if the aim of public policy were exclusively
the prevention of pretrial crime, the ideal solution would be to jail
every defendant.

The Legal Aid Society of New York brought a suit in 1972 (see
Bellamy v. Abruczo, N.Y. Sup. Ct., March 1972) challenging the

New York bail system. However, their major argument was that the
use of money bail, which made it unlikely that low income defendants

woud obtain pretrial liberty, was in violation of constitutional
guarantees of equal protection of the laws and due process of law.

58.

One may also argue that the systematic features of the setting of
bond in New York City are not representative of the operation of all

bail systems. Instead, these features are most app1icble to a
criminal justice system where large numbers of defendants disappear
and hence where the imposition of criminal sanctions almost requires
pretrial detention.

59.

Of the remaining 851 defendants, 133 disappeared, 218 were dismissed,
and 500 entered guilty pleas.

argument that pretrial detention reduces

the productivity of the defendant's inputs together with some quantitative estimates of these effects

using data across counties in the U.S.

in 1962. It is also claimed that
favorable sentences if they are

released defendants receive more
or

employed/regularly participate in a

counselling program. Since these options are conditional on liberty,
this would further widen the observed difference in sentences between
detained and released defendants.

26. F

61.

Obviously the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. That
is, persons with higher expected sentences may be more likely to
be detained and detention may increase the expected sentence.

62.

Estimation of equation (9) was by the maximum-likelihood logit
method (see Table 7) where the dependent variable was the odds of

pretrial liberty and not BAIL. Observations with a $0 BOND were
excluded from this estimation (weakening the negative effect of BOND
on pretrial liberty) and several cash alternative variables were

added to the estimated equations. Since the purpose here is not
to reestimate (9) but to illustrate the recursive nature of our system,

the linear specification without the cash alternative is sufficient.

63.

Several problems arise in the estimation of the sentence equations.

(1) No data are available on convictions resulting in fines. Hence
some defendants would be included in the zero sentence class if they

received only a fine. If the sentence included the option of a jail
sentence or a fine, then the defendant's jail sentence would be the
sentence variable in our sample.(2) There is some uncertainty as to
a

the proper classification of/defendant who disappeared and hence
where there is no formal disposition. Since disappearances are
concentrated in the released group, their inclusion (by assigning a
zero sentence to persons who disappear) in the regression would tend
to bias upward the effect of pretrial detention on the sentence.

Alternatively, disappearing is one way to avoid penalties (providing
one is not reapprehended) and thus does reflect a real difference in

27. F
63 continued

outcome between released and detained persons. The estimates in
Table 14 exclude defendants who disappear. In a later footnote
we indicate the sensitivity of the results to the inclusion of

the disappearance group. (3) There are 388 defendants in our sample
who received jail sentences. Thus only 54 per cent of our observations have a non-zero dependent variable (when defendants who dis-

appeared are excluded from the analysis). Under these circumstances
it is questionable whether ordinary least squares is the most
appropriate estimation technique.

64.

An alternative hypothesis that might appear consistent with the
findings in Table 14 is that a high bond drains the defendant's
resources and hence raises his conviction probability and sentence.

This would imply, however, that variations in bond for detained
defendants alone would have no impact on the outcome, other things

constant. This can be tested by reestimating equation 14.1 for the
subset of detained defendants. The regression coefficient on BOND
continues to be positive and highly significant (= .017 with a t-value

of 7.80) and of the same order of magnitude as the coefficient on
BOND in 14.1.

65.

13 per cent of released defendants received a jail sentence in

comparison to 66 per cent of detained defendants. Since a large
number of released defendants voluntarily appear for their court
hearings, the probability of receiving a jail sentence •is probably

substantially smaller than .13 for defendants who disappear.

28. F

66.

Both this result and the result on the bond variable do not depend
on the exclusion of defendants who disappear from the regression

analysis. When these defendants are included, the reestimation
of 14.1 which 858 defendants yields coefficients and (t-values) on

BOND and BAIL respectively of .018 (11.135) and .031 (.580), and
the reestimation of 14.4 with 764 defendants yields .019 (10.656)
and .045 (.738) for BOND and BAIL respectively.

67.

DAYS-i and DAYS-2 are not available for persons who disappeared or

whose cases were dismissed. Thus, regressions using the days variables contain at most 504 defendants or the subset of defendants that

entered quilty pleas and went to trial. The deletion of dismissals
means that 221 defendants who had a zero value for the sentence

are dropped from the empirical analysis. Since dismissals are relatively concentrated in the released group (55 per cent of dismissals
were released on bail compared to 23 per cent in the non-dismissed
group) and in the lower bond values ($775 average bond compared to
$1284 for those not dismissed), one might expect the results on BOND

and BAIL in 14.5-14.7 to be weaker. This may be offset by the large
number of zero values for the dependent variable when dismissals are

included which biases the regression coefficients towards zero. A
comparison between 14.1 and 14.5,where 14.5 excludes dismissals,
reveals that the elimination of dismissals does not alter our results

on BOND and BAIL nor does it alter substantially the coefficients
of the other independent variables. The similarity between 14.1 and
14.5 further suggests that inferences on the effects of the days

variables in 14.6 and 14.7 are likely to hold up had data allowed all
defendants to be included in the regression estimates.

29. F

68.

One reason for the observed effect of DAYS-i may be that the
sentence variable does not reflect the fact that a defendant
receives credit towards his sentence for the amount of pretrial

detention. Consider the following situation: a defendant detained
for 60 days receives a sentence of 60 days and is released immedi-

ately after his guilty plea is formally entered, and another
defendant detained for 30 days receives a 30 day sentence and is

also released. Although in both cases the actual sentence is zero
and hence there is no effect of pretrial detention, our empirical
analysis would show a positive effect of detention on the sentence.

To test for this we reestimated equations 14.6 and 14.7, substracting

from the sentence the amount of pretrial detention. Thus, if the
latter exceeded or equalled the sentence measure in Table 14, we

set the actual sentence equal to zero. The regression coefficients
and (t-values) on BOND, DAYS-i and DAYS-2 after this adjustment
are given below.

Although the effect of DAYS-i is reduced (as expected) it is still

positive and statistically significant. BOND remains highly significant and the dominating variable. Note that it is not obvious
that the above adjustment is desirable. If the sentence (prior to
our adjustment) has already been reduced for days detained, then
our additional adjustment is clearly incorrect.

where A3 is the regression coefficient on ASC. Since B0ND/ASC

is approximately 1.4 (from Table 4) and A2 in Table 14 is nearly
.02, the intirect effect of one year of ASC is about .028 or about

10 days. Hence the total effect of one year of a statutory penalty
is between 18 and 32 days of sentence. Indirect effects of other
variables in equations (8) and (10) are calculated in an identical
manner.

INJ was the only variable in the severity of offense group (aside
from ASC) that was significant in the bond regressions in Table 4.
Note that the total estimated effect of a non-serious injury to
a complaining witness is half the effect of a serious one.
