Differences in the U.S. Trends in the Prevalence of Obesity Based on Body Mass Index and
Skinfold Thickness

ABSTRACT
There are several ways to measure fatness and obesity, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
The primary measure for tracking the prevalence of obesity has historically been body mass index
(BMI). This paper compares long-run trends in the prevalence of obesity when obesity is defined
using skinfold thickness instead of body mass index (BMI), using data from the full series of U.S.
National Health Examination Surveys. The results indicate that when one uses skinfold thicknesses
rather than BMI to define obesity, the rise in the prevalence of obesity is detectable ten to twenty years
earlier. This underscores the importance of examining multiple measures of fatness when monitoring
or otherwise studying obesity.

BACKGROUND
According to the U.S. Surgeon General, obesity has reached “nationwide epidemic
proportions” in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001). The
rise in obesity is troubling because it is associated with elevated risks of morbidity (Reither et al.
2009; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001), functional limitations (Himes
2000) and mortality (Flegal et al. 2007; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2001).
In addition, the obese tend to suffer social stigma (Puhl and Heuer 2009) and have a lower
probability of marriage (Averett and Korenman 1999).
There is considerable interest in better understanding the reasons that obesity began to
rise (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2002; Anderson et al. 2003; Lakdawalla et al. 2005; Cutler et al.
2003; Lakdawalla and Philipson 2002; Philipson and Posner 1999; Gruber and Frakes 2006;
Chou et al. 2004), which requires accurately dating the beginning of its increase.
There are many ways to measure fatness and therefore obesity, each with its own
strengths and weaknesses (Burkhauser and Cawley 2008). A practical consideration is that few
measures of fatness have been consistently collected over time. One measure of fatness that has
been consistently collected in nationally representative health surveys is body mass index (BMI),
which is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. The vast
majority of previous studies that have dated the beginning of the rise in obesity have defined
obesity using BMI and concluded that obesity was relatively constant from roughly 1960 to
roughly 1980, after which obesity rose considerably (Flegal et al. 1998, 2002).
However, there is one additional measure of fatness that has been consistently collected
in nationally representative health surveys: skinfold thickness. The purpose of this paper is to
date the beginning of the rise in obesity when obesity is defined using skinfold thickness, and to

3

determine whether it differs when one uses skinfold thickness rather than BMI to define obesity.
In its interest in thinking broadly in order to enrich understanding of the rise in obesity, this
paper complements a previous study that considered alternate measures of overweight and
obesity using BMI (Joliffe 2004).
The findings of this paper result in new and different interpretations of the rise on obesity
over the last 50 years in the U.S. Specifically, the rise in obesity defined using skinfolds is
apparent ten to twenty years earlier than the rise in obesity defined using BMI. This implies that
the rise in obesity may be due to more gradual and longer running influences than was previously
appreciated. It also indicates that if obesity surveillance had monitored multiple measures of
fatness, the rise in obesity might have been detected, and public health campaigns could have
begun, two decades earlier. In general, because each measure of fatness has its own strengths
and weaknesses, research on obesity is enriched by greater consideration of multiple such
measures.

DATA AND METHODS
Surveys
This study utilizes the series of nationally representative, cross-sectional health surveys
sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The National Health Examination Survey, Cycle I (NHES I) was conducted on a
sample of persons aged 18-79 years during 1959-1962. The NHES Cycle 3 (NHES III) was
conducted on a sample of youths aged 12-17 years during 1966-1970. The National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) program began with NHANES I, which was
conducted 1971-1975, and was followed by NHANES II (1976-1980), NHANES III (1988-

4

1994), and NHANES Continuous (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006) (5-9). In
each of these surveys, a nationally representative sample of the US civilian non-institutionalized
population was selected using a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling
design.
For adults, there is variation in the upper end of the age range sampled in the various
NHES and NHANES surveys. Excluding NHES III, which was devoted solely to youths, data
are always collected for those up to age 74, so for the sake of consistency we limit each adult
sample to those aged 20-74 years. Categories of race and ethnicity were not consistent across the
surveys so all races and ethnicities were pooled. Final sample sizes for youths aged 12-17 are
listed in Table 1 and those for adults are listed in Table 3.

BMI, Skinfolds, and Obesity
Each NHES and NHANES survey included physical examinations conducted in a
specially-designed and equipped mobile examination center. A survey team including a
physician and medical and health technicians measured tricep and subscapular skinfold
thicknesses, weight, and height in every survey. Other measures of fatness were also recorded in
certain surveys, but the only fatness measures consistently collected from NHES until NHANES
2005-2006 are the two skinfold measures and weight and height. The maximum weight that
could be measured was not binding in NHES, and was 400 pounds (182 kg) in NHANES I and
II. In NHANES III it was again not binding and in NHANES Continuous it was 440 kg (968
pounds). The top-coding of weight does not affect our classification of individuals, as everyone
with the maximum weight is clinically obese.

5

Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared. Adult obesity was defined in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
and the World Health Organization as a BMI of 30 or higher (NHLBI Expert Panel 1998; World
Health Organization Consultation on Obesity 2000). Youth obesity was defined using smoothed
age-and-gender-specific 85th percentile thresholds for BMI from the NHANES I distribution
(Must et al. 1991).
Skinfolds were assessed using calipers at the tricep and subscapular region (below the
shoulder blade). In NHES and NHANES I and II, skinfold thicknesses were measured by Lange
calipers manufactured by Cambridge Scientific Instruments that have a maximum value of 65
mm. For the examinations associated with NHANES III, a Holtain T/W caliper with a 50 mm
maximum was used. For NHANES Continuous, the medical examinations used a Holtain-brand
caliper with a 45 mm maximum. In general variability in compression can affect the reliability
of skinfold measurements, but the Lange and Holtain calipers used in NHES and NHANES exert
a constant pressure (Heymsfield et al. 2004). The NHES and NHANES medical technicians
were trained in taking skinfold thicknesses to ensure accuracy and reliability (National Center for
Health Statistics 2000).
The NHANES III and NHANES Continuous noted when a skinfold exceeded the
capacity of the calipers. The percentage of the examined adult sample with tricep skinfolds
larger than the maximum caliper size was as follows: 1.9% in NHANES III and from 3.6% to
5.8% in each of the three surveys in NHANES Continuous. The percentage of the examined
adult sample with subscapular skinfolds larger than the maximum caliper size was as follows:
2.4% in NHANES III, 4.5% in NHANES 1999-2000, 1.9% in NHANES 2001-2002, 1.6% in
NHANES 2003-2004, and 2.1% in NHANES 2005-06. We do not make use of the subscapular

6

skinfolds for our analysis of youth obesity. For youths, the percentage of the examined sample
with tricep skinfolds larger than the maximum caliper size was as follows: 1.4% in NHANES III,
1.5% in NHANES 1999-2000, 1.2% in NHANES 2001-2002, 1.4% in NHANES 2003-2004, and
0.9% in NHANES 2005-06. For all respondents whose skinfold exceeds the maximum caliper
size we recode their skinfold thickness to be equal to the maximum caliper size. This top-coding
of skinfold thickness does not affect our estimates of the prevalence of obesity because such
individuals are obese whether their skinfold is set equal to the maximum caliper size or an even
larger number.
In addition to recording whether the skinfold exceeded the maximum caliper size, the
NHANES Continuous indicated if the examiner could not obtain a measurement (presumably for
reasons other than the skinfold exceeding the maximum caliper size). For adults, the percentage
of the examined sample for whom tricep skinfold thickness could not be obtained was 2.8% in
NHANES 1999-2000, 5.6% in NHANES 2001-2002, 7.1% in NHANES 2003-2004, and 10.2%
in NHANES 2005-06. The percentage of the examined adult sample for which subscapular
skinfold thickness could not be obtained was 15.3% in NHANES 1999-2000, 21.4% in
NHANES 2001-2002, 20.8% in NHANES 2003-2004, and 27.0% in NHANES 2005-06. For
youths, the percentage of the examined sample for whom tricep skinfold thickness could not be
obtained was 3.2% in NHANES III, 1.2% in NHANES 1999-2000, 1.9% in NHANES 20012002, 3.2% in NHANES 2003-2004, and 3.9% in NHANES 2005-06. When the skinfold could
not be obtained, we impute it using the other skinfold thickness, measured BMI, age, age
squared, and race and ethnicity; this prediction equation is based on respondents with complete
information. These regression models explain 91.2% to 96.4% of the variance in skinfolds,
implying that the imputation procedure accurately predicts the missing skinfolds.

7

The definition of obesity based on skinfold thicknesses differs for youth and adults.
Following the literature, we define youth obesity using tricep (but not subscapular) skinfold
thickness; specifically, a youth is classified as obese if the tricep skinfold thickness exceeds the
smoothed age-and-gender-specific 85th percentile thresholds from the NHANES I distribution
(Gortmaker and Dietz 1990; Must et al. 1991).
Adults were classified as obese or non-obese using the following steps. First, body
density was predicted using tricep and subscapular skinfold thicknesses (Durnin and Womersley
1974). Second, percent body fat was computed using body density (Durnin and Womersley
1974; Siri 1956). (Use of an alternate equation for converting body density to percent body fat
(Brozek et al. 1963) yielded similar trends.) Finally, men were classified as obese if their
percent body fat exceeded 25%, and women were classified as obese if their percent body fat
exceeded 30% (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Accessed
2007).

Methods
Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS for Windows software (SAS for
Windows, Version 9.1.3 Service Pack 3). All analyses excluded pregnant females. The
prevalence of obesity was calculated for each age group and in each survey. To avoid having
changes in the age distribution of the population affect trends in obesity, the obesity rates in each
survey are age- and sex-adjusted based on population counts in the 2000 Census. Specifically,
estimates were age-standardized to Census 2000 counts of age groups 12-17 years, 20 to 39
years, 40 to 59 years, and 60-74 years. (We use the age group 12-17 years because that was the
age range of NHES III, and we use the adult age groups that are the convention in recent studies

8

of the prevalence of obesity (e.g. Flegal et al. 2002). Adhering to previously-used age ranges
facilitates comparisons with the previous literature but has the unfortunate consequence of
omitting youths aged 18-19.) For all surveys, estimates are based on the sampling weights
associated with the sample that underwent medical examinations. Estimates also take into
account the complex survey design, including unequal probabilities of selection, non-response,
and deliberate over-sampling of certain groups. Tests of the hypothesis of equality of obesity
prevalence over time were conducted, using a significance level of .05.

RESULTS
Youths Aged 12-17 Years
Figure 1 presents the trend between NHES III (1966-70) and NHANES 2005-06 in
obesity defined using BMI (denoted with diamond symbols) and obesity defined using skinfold
thickness (denoted with square symbols) for youths aged 12-17. The specific estimates by
survey, sex, and definition of obesity are provided in Table 1. Table 2 documents the
percentage-point changes in obesity between NHES III (1966-70) and NHANES II (1976-80),
NHANES II (1976-80) and NHANES Continuous (1999-2005), and the overall change between
NHES I (1966-70) and NHANES Continuous (1999-2005); it also lists p values associated with a
test of the hypothesis that each trend is equal to zero.
Earlier studies that examined changes in the prevalence of youth obesity defined using
BMI concluded that obesity was relatively constant from NHES III to NHANES II (Flegal et al.
1990). Limiting our attention to this range, Figure 1 confirms that obesity defined using BMI
experienced little net increase between NHES III and NHANES II because it first rose between
NHES III and NHANES I and then fell between NHANES I and NHANES II. In contrast,

9

obesity defined using skinfolds rose monotonically from the first to the second to the third
survey. Table 1 provides the exact statistics; for both genders pooled BMI-defined obesity first
rose from 14.6 to 18.4 percent, then fell to 16.6 percent, while skinfold-defined obesity rose from
10.1 to 14.5 to 15.2 percent.
Table 2 reports the changes in prevalence from survey to survey in percentage points and
also indicates whether the change was statistically significant. Table 2 confirms that the 5.1
percentage point change between NHES III and NHANES II in skinfold-defined obesity was
statistically significant (P<.001), and that the overall change of 2.1 percentage points over the
same period in BMI-defined obesity was also statistically significant at the 1 percent level
(P=0.01). When the changes are examined separately by sex, the point estimates of the change
from NHES III to NHANES II remain positive for both measures of obesity, but they are only
statistically significant for obesity defined using skinfolds.
Next turning to the latest five surveys, Figure 1 confirms that the trend in both measures
of obesity is generally (though not monotonically) upward. Table 2 reports the change from
NHANES II to NHANES 2005-06. An 11 percentage point rise in skinfold-defined obesity and a
15.6 percentage point rise in BMI-defined obesity are both statistically significant at the 1
percent level.
Looking over the entire range of data, the long-term trend from NHES III to NHANES
2005-06 is a rise of 16.1 percentage points in skinfold-defined obesity and a rise of 17.7
percentage points in BMI-defined obesity. Both values are statistically significant (P<.001).
Adults Aged 20-74 Years
The prevalence of adult obesity defined using BMI and skinfold thicknesses are presented
in Table 3. Table 4 documents the percentage-point changes in obesity between NHES I and

10

NHANES II, NHANES II and NHANES Continuous, and the overall change between NHES I
and NHANES Continuous; it also lists p values associated with a test of the hypothesis that each
trend is equal to zero. Earlier studies that examined changes in the prevalence of adult obesity
defined using BMI have concluded that obesity was relatively constant from NHES I to
NHANES II (Flegal et al. 1998, 2002). Tables 3 and 4 confirm that finding; obesity defined
using BMI rose from 14.4% to 14.7% between NHES I and NHANES II (P=.34) before rising to
31.8% in NHANES 2005-2006 (P<.001). However, when skinfold thicknesses are used to
define obesity, the rise in obesity is apparent beginning with the earliest data; it rises from 26.5%
to 34.7% between NHES I and NHANES II (P<.001) and continues to 43.4% in NHANES 20052006 (P<.001). Figure 2 illustrates that the rise in obesity defined using skinfold thickness
(denoted with square symbols) began before the rise in obesity defined using BMI (denoted with
diamond symbols).
Table 3 also shows the prevalence of obesity by gender and age group in each survey.
For each gender, with all ages 20-74 pooled, the rise in skinfold-defined obesity is apparent
between NHES I and NHANES II, while the rise in BMI-defined obesity is only apparent
between NHANES II and NHANES III. For men aged 20-74, the prevalence of skinfold-defined
obesity rises from 13.5% to 18.5% between NHES I and NHANES II (P<.001), whereas the
prevalence of BMI-defined obesity only rises from 11.7% to 12.4% over the same period
(P=.24). For women aged 20-74, the prevalence of skinfold-defined obesity increases from
39.1% to 50.4% between NHES I and NHANES II (P<.001), whereas BMI-defined obesity dips
slightly from 17.0% to 16.9% over the same period (P=.45).

11

Looking within age groups by gender, the same pattern is present for men 40-59 and 6074 and women 20-39 and 40-59. Among men 20-39 and women 60-74 there is little increase in
skinfold-defined obesity and a decline in BMI-defined obesity.

DISCUSSION
Previous research that used BMI to define obesity dated the beginning of the rise in U.S.
obesity, among both youths and adults, from NHANES II (1976-80) to NHANES III (1988-94).
This article finds that when skinfold thickness is used to define obesity, the rise in obesity is
apparent starting from the earliest surveys, which for adults is NHES I (1959-62), and which for
youths is NHES III (1966-70).
This implies that the rise in obesity may be due to more gradual and longer running
influences than was previously appreciated. Previous research has investigated the extent to
which the rise in BMI-defined obesity was due to specific causes, such as falling food prices
(Lakdawalla and Philipson 2002), increasing maternal employment (Anderson et al. 2003),
technological innovation in food preparation and preservation (Cutler et al. 2003), school
finances (Anderson and Butcher 2006), and reduced smoking (Chou et al. 2004; Gruber and
Frakes 2006), but this literature, guided by the findings based on BMI, may be focusing too
narrowly on recent events and missing the earlier influences that contributed to the rise in
skinfold-defined obesity ten to twenty years earlier.
These findings relate to a twenty-year-old controversy over the use of skinfold
thicknesses and BMI to define adolescent obesity. A study published in 1987 (Gortmaker et al.
1987) found a rise between NHES III and NHANES II (i.e. from 1966-1980) in the prevalence of
adolescent obesity defined using skinfold thickness. A study published the next year (Harlan et

12

al. 1988) opposed the use of skinfolds to measure trends between NHES and NHANES, arguing:
“The main point at issue is how to interpret the observation that, for adolescents, body mass
index does not show a trend across surveys but skinfold measurements do show a trend. One
possibility is that from 1967 to 1980 the adolescent population got fatter at a constant body mass
index…Another possibility is that the small differences in skinfold measurements across surveys
are an artifact of measurement error. Neither of these possibilities can be ruled out with the
available data.” (Flegal et al. 1990).
This paper sheds light on that debate. Figures 1 and 2 include twenty-five years of data
from five surveys that were not available during the original exchange. With the benefit of
hindsight, one can see from Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2 that, among both youths and
adults, skinfold-defined obesity began rising one to two surveys earlier than BMI-defined
obesity, and that this was a long-term trend. Relative to the limited information available at the
time of the original exchange, the 25 years of additional data lend credibility to the claim that
skinfold-defined obesity was rising at a time that BMI-defined obesity was not. In other words,
the rise in skinfold-defined obesity did not occur in the complete absence of a rise in BMIdefined obesity; it simply preceded it. A rise in obesity defined using skinfolds may be what
forecasters call a “leading indicator” of a rise in obesity defined using BMI.
It is possible for obesity to be rising by one measure but not by another because various
indices of fatness measure different things and the threshold for obesity is drawn at different
points in their distributions (NHLBI Expert Panel 1998; World Health Organization 2000;
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Accessed 2007). For
example, obesity defined using skinfolds classifies more people as obese (i.e. it is a lower
threshold) than obesity defined using BMI, so it is possible that people in the healthy weight and

13

overweight categories of BMI gained enough fat to make them obese by skinfold thickness but
not enough fat to make them obese by BMI. In other words, the rise in obesity defined using
skinfolds reflected increases in fatness among people who remained pre-obese according to BMI.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we calculate that the prevalence of skinfold-defined obesity
among adults rose 20.6% among those with BMI less than 30 and rose only 9.7% among those
with BMI greater than or equal to 30, between NHES and NHANES I. Further evidence that
fatness measures can move independently of each other appears in a recent study (Elobeid et al.
2007) that finds that waist circumference rose faster between 1959 and 2004 than one would
expect given changes in BMI over the same period.
In 2001, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a “call to action” on obesity (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services 2001) and the World Health Organization has stated that the need
for public health action is “urgent” (World Health Organization 2004). In recent years, states
have increasingly taken legislative action to prevent or reduce obesity (Cawley and Liu 2008). If
more previous research had used skinfolds to monitor obesity, the rise in obesity might have
been detected a decade or two sooner. If that had happened, public health and public policy
responses might have been implemented, and progress in preventing obesity could have begun,
earlier.
BMI and skinfold thickness are both widely accepted indices for measuring fatness and
defining obesity (World Health Organization 1995; Mei et al. 2002). For example, both are
frequently-used endpoints to evaluate anti-obesity interventions (Flodmark et al. 2006; Doak et
al. 2006). A comparison of the two measures using NHANES I data concluded that BMI and
skinfold thickness are “interchangeable for many epidemiologic research applications” (Must et
al. 1991). Studies of NHANES III data to validate BMI as a predictor of body fat have used

14

skinfold thickness as the gold standard for subcutaneous fat (Mei et al. 2002). Studies have used
both BMI and skinfold thickness to track short-term trends in obesity, although studies using
skinfold thickness are far less common (Freedman et al. 1997; Kromeyer-Hauschild and Jaeger
1998; Moreno et al. 2001; Dollman and Pilgrim 2005), and the series of NHES and NHANES
surveys remained unexploited for the present purpose.
BMI and skinfold thickness each have their strengths and weaknesses as measures of
fatness and obesity. BMI is widely used because it is easy to calculate, but it is a noisy measure
of fatness because it does not distinguish fat from muscle, bone, and other lean body mass
(Yusuf et al. 2005; Kragelund and Omland 2005; Gallagher et al. 1996; Smalley et al. 1990;
Garn et al. 1986). As a result, BMI overestimates fatness among those who are muscular (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services 2001; Prentice and Jebb 2001).
A strength of skinfold thickness is that it distinguishes fat from muscle. Because between
70-90% of all adipose tissue is subcutaneous, skinfold thicknesses accurately measure total body
fat (Heymsfield et al. 2004). In addition, the tricep and subscapular sites are preferred because
of accessibility, ease of measurement, and high correlation with total body fat (Heymsfield et al.
2004). However, a limitation of skinfold thickness is that tricep and subscapular skinfolds do not
measure central adiposity, which has been shown to be associated with a greater risk of
morbidity and mortality (National Institutes of Health 1998). Skinfolds are less accurate in the
very lean and very obese (Deurenburg and Deurenburg-Yap 2004), but that is less of a problem
for this analysis, which focuses on obesity status rather than variation in fatness within clinical
weight classifications. Another limitation is that interviewers were more likely to be unable to
obtain skinfold measurements than weight in pounds or kilograms. Also, using skinfolds to
define obesity for adults involves the use of two conversion equations (from skinfold thickness to

15

body density, and body density to percent body fat). Consequently, the body fat percentage
calculated from skinfolds reflects the cumulative error from the application of two models. A
limitation of both BMI and skinfolds is that they may ignore differences across ethnic groups in
body fat or its distribution (Burkhauser and Cawley 2008; Deurenburg and Deurenburg-Yap
2004).
This paper emphatically does not take the position that skinfold thickness is superior to
BMI as a measure of fatness. This paper’s position is: given the enormous attention devoted to
trends in obesity based on BMI, an examination of trends in obesity based on the only alternative
measure of fatness that is consistently available -- skinfold thickness -- is worthwhile.
There are multiple valid measures of fatness and yet they yield different trends in obesity.
This suggests that one should monitor multiple measures of fatness to increase the probability of
detecting trends early. Even more generally, research on obesity can be enriched by greater
consideration of alternative measures of fatness and body composition.

Notes:
1) Data points are located at mid-point of surveys NHES cycle 3 (1966-70), NHANES I
(1971-75), NHANES II (1976-80), and NHANES III (1988-94). For the following
NHANES Continuous surveys, data points are placed at the first of the two years of the
surveys: NHANES 1999-2000, NHANES 2001-02, NHANES 2003-04, NHANES 200506.
2) Obesity rates are age- and sex-adjusted based on population counts in the 2000 Census.
