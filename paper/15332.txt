New Evidence on the First Financial Bubble

ABSTRACT
The first global financial bubble in stock prices occurred 1720 in Paris, London and the Netherlands.
Explanations for these linked bubbles primarily focus on the irrationality of investor speculation and
the corresponding stock price behavior of two large firms: the South Sea Company in Great Britain
and the Mississippi Company in France. In this paper we examine a broad crosssection of security
price data to evaluate the causes of the bubbles. Using newly collected stock prices for British and
Dutch firms in 1720, we find evidence against indiscriminate irrational exuberance and evidence in
favor of speculation about two factors: the Atlantic trade and the incorporation of insurance companies.
We study the role of innovation in the insurance market by examining market betas and volatilities
of new insurance company shares, like (Pastor & Veronesi, Technological Revolutions and Stock Prices,
2009). We find strong evidence for a revolution in the insurance business in 1720. Our findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that financial bubbles require a plausible story to justify investor optimism.

Introduction

Asset bubbles are important puzzles in financial economics – important because of
their extraordinarily potential for disruption; puzzles because they defy standard
notions of rationality. Recent research in the wake of the NASDAQ bubble and the
global housing bubble has highlighted the role of uncertainty and technological
innovation in the development of asset bubbles. In particular, Pastor and Veronesi
(2005, 2006) argue that technological innovation and investor uncertainty can
explain high security valuations and the rapid rise and fall of stocks related to
potentially transformative technological innovations. Their papers make cross‐
sectional empirical predictions about securities during periods of technological
change. They show that imputed growth rates in innovative industries can appear
irrationally high ex post and that industries in which bubbles occur will be
characterized by high return volatility, high uncertainty and rapid adoption of the
new technology. They test these predictions on 19th century railroad securities
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In this paper we revisit one of the most famous events in financial history: the South
Sea Bubble of 1720. Along with the earlier Dutch Tulipmania, of the 17th century, the
South Sea Bubble is often regarded as an example par excellence of investor
irrationality. However, unlike Tulipmania, which was confined to the futures market
in tulip bulbs, the South Sea Bubble involved many stocks traded in three different
countries. Although 1720 is not generally viewed as a period of technological
novelty, we argue in this paper that there were at least three critical innovations
that took place in a very short span of time; two of which were financial innovations,
the other was a major potential shift in the configuration of global trade.
The first innovation was financial engineering at a national scale. The Mississippi
Company and the South Sea Company issued equity shares in exchange for
government debt; in effect converting the national debt into corporate stock. This
novelty appeared to be a new model for government finance: a heavily politically‐

1

influenced corporation that also had exclusive rights and patents to pursue other
ventures. The second innovation was an incipient shift in global trade. Both of the
companies were set up to exploit trade in the Americas. The Mississippi Company
owned the Louisiana territory and the South Sea Company owned the exclusive
right to export African slaves to Spanish America. Spanish domination of the
Atlantic trade was weakened as a result of the War of the Spanish Succession [1701‐
1714] , and the War of the Quadruple Alliance [1718‐1720], opening the door to
increased competition from Britain, France and the Netherlands. These geopolitical
conditions offered great possibilities, but also great uncertainty.
The third innovation was also financial. The first publicly traded insurance
corporations were chartered in Great Britain 1720, as a result of the famous Bubble
Act. As such, they represented a new model of capital formation and risk‐sharing for
maritime insurance firms – in a nation built on maritime trade. This innovation was
rapidly imitated in the Netherlands, despite past Dutch dominance of maritime
insurance. The innovation in insurance form also stirred great debate and
uncertainty about its effects.
Ex post, two of these three innovations had a transformative effect on the global
economy. Although government debt for equity swaps did not survive the financial
crisis when the South Sea bubble burst, the Atlantic trade did. The triangle trade
between Europe, Africa and the Caribbean eventually became the dominant
international trade system of the 18th and early 19th centuries. Finally, the
emergence of publicly financed, limited liability insurance companies ultimately
transformed risk sharing. The publicly traded insurance companies founded in 1720
survived and flourished and became models for the insurance trade in both the old
and the new worlds. The public insurance corporation is now the dominant
institutional form.
In this paper we examine to extent to which the bubble of 1720 might be explained
by current models of technological innovation and share price dynamics. To do so,
we collect cross‐sectional security price information for a number of stocks traded

2

in London and the Netherlands. Some of the security price data is brand new to
scholarship. We use these new data to measure cross‐sectional differences in the
timing, steepness and magnitude of share price increases in 1720.
We find strong evidence that the dynamics of the South Sea Bubble differed by
industry. We next document the extent to which these industry effects extended
across national boundaries. Our results suggest that speculation about the Atlantic
trade with the Americas was an important factor in investor expectations. We also
find evidence that market prices and new issues in Britain and the Netherlands were
driven in part by investor expectations about the financial innovations in the
insurance trade. On the other hand, we find little evidence that the debt‐conversion
function of the Mississippi and South Sea companies was an important factor.
Finally, we find some qualified support for the hypothesis that investors were
simply enthusiastic about stocks in general. Most shares rose in the British and
Dutch bubbles, but the growth in those not associated with the Atlantic trade or
with the insurance trade was significantly less.

Background
Most early writers treat the bubbles of 1720 as evidence of investor irrationality. 1
Dale, Johnson, & Tang (2005) explicitly test this theory using violations of the law of
one price. 2 Others have argued that the bubbles were not necessarily evidence of
irrational expectations on the part of investors, but rather the result of plausible
expectations of future returns, 3 or a reasonable response to such financial
innovations as the liquidity of shares and the potential of companies to exploit new
capital markets and investment opportunities. 4 Garber (1990) shows how the high
price for the South Sea Company might have been justified by plausible expected
1

Cf. Charles Mackay (1852), Vissering (1863) van Rijn (1899), Kindleberger (1978).
In response, Shea (2007) argues that the Dale et al. (2005) test of the law of one price using share
subscriptions is infeasible.

returns on invested capital. On the other hand, Velde (2009) comes to opposite
conclusions for the Mississippi Company, arguing that in the short‐term it was
financially over‐extended.
An important challenge for financial historians is to understand how investor
expectations at the time could have driven stock prices up by many multiples in the
space of a few months. What could have made investors suddenly willing to pay so
much for shares in these companies? In this paper we do not seek to test the
rationality of investors but rather to provide more information about what factors
may have influenced their beliefs.
For example, if the bubbles in the South Sea Company and the Mississippi Company
were driven by expectations about the future profitability of Atlantic trade – in
which both firms held patents – then other firms engaged in Atlantic trade should
also have experienced high price run‐ups in 1720, and conversely, prices of firms
not engaged in the trade should not have grown as much. If the speculation was
about the debt‐conversion operations of the companies then other financial firms
should have experienced comparable price run‐ups. Thus, the cross‐sectional
variation in stock returns of the 1720s may reveal the factor‐specific basis for
investor aspirations that created the bubble – whether rational or not. The contrary
hypothesis is that irrational exuberance in 1720 might simply have been
indiscriminate, affecting all stocks.

In this case we would not expect to find

systematic differences across industries.
The barrier to examining the 1720 bubble in cross‐section has always been one of
data. Up to this point, the prices for some very important companies such as the
Dutch East Indies and Dutch West Indies companies have not been available to
researchers. Scholars have also not had access to prices for the considerable number
of initial public offerings from the London and Dutch markets that were floated in
1720. While excellent British price data for several companies has been collected

4

and studied 5 no one has yet made a comparative study of the prices for British
insurance companies for that period, despite the fact that they were the focus of the
main Parliamentary legislation regulating financial markets in 1720, commonly
known as the Bubble Act.
In this paper we collect share prices for Dutch and English companies from a Dutch
newspaper published in 1720, the Leydse Courant. We also collect price data for
Royal Exchange Assurance and the London Assurance from the leading London
financial periodical of the time, The Course of the Exchange. Together with the
British data from Neal (1990) We are able to track the course of 26 Dutch company
stocks through the entirety 1720, including the Dutch East and West Indies
Companies and a broad sample of British firms over the same interval. We also use
Dutch company archives to provide institutional details about mechanisms of share
speculation.
We find evidence against indiscriminate irrational exuberance and evidence in favor
of speculation about two factors: the Atlantic trade and the incorporation of
insurance companies. The fundamentals of both sectors may have led to high
expectations of future growth. The Atlantic trade was the focus of considerable
political and economic activity around 1720 and the insurance business was
undergoing a transition towards the corporate form. Other sectors, such as the
financial industry and firms engaged in the Asian trade evidently did not inspire the
same scale or investor enthusiasm. The South Sea and Mississippi bubbles were
clearly not limited to major firms operating to refund government debt.
The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a cross‐sectional analysis
of share prices in 1720 in order to test competing theories about investor
expectations in the first great crash of the world’s stock markets. It also introduces
a hitherto unstudied source of Dutch company prices that documents the scale and

timing of the crash in the Netherlands. This dataset allows us to study an early and
important example of the international propagation of a financial crisis.
Data
We collected prices reported for Dutch and British companies from the Leydse
Courant (preserved in the National Library of the Netherlands in the Hague) over
the period November 1719 to December 1720. 6 These include London transactions
of British companies, as well as occasional prices for the same firms on exchanges in
the Netherlands. We added these prices to those collected by Larry Neal and used in
Neal (1990) to study capital market integration in the 18th century. 7 We augmented
the Neal data with daily quotation series’ from the The Course of the Exchange for
the two major British insurance companies.
Evidently no previous scholarship had looked at a complete sequence of the Leydse
Courant, and no study so far has used regular Dutch price information for the period
1720 to 1723, although scholars had been able to gather occasional references to
prices. 8 British stock prices are available for the late 17th and early 18th century in
Castaing’s The Course of the Exchange and two other sources, but Dutch data in
general has been lacking for this turbulent period. The British insurance company
prices in 1720 have been used to construct market indices, 9 but not studied
separately.
Leydse Courant prices were not quoted in currency but as percentages of par value
net of paid‐in capital. Share issues at the time were offered as subscriptions that
required an initial payment that secured the subscription rights. In effect, issuing

8 See Gelderblom & Jonker (2008). In a sebsequent revision (2009), concurrent with the first draft of
own work, they report Dutch prices for the second half of 1720. Neal (1988) mentions the Leydse
Courant, but notes that only a few issues are extant for the period. In fact, he implores scholars to
search Dutch libraries for a complete run of them.

companies financed the purchase of their shares with a loan, using the shares as
collateral. 10 The initial payment was typically a small fraction (1% to 10%) of the
par value of the share and came with obligations to make future payments to the
company over a period of time – sometimes on a monthly basis, but other times at
irregular intervals. This convention made comparisons across companies
straightforward, since it had the effect of normalizing the prices. We were able to
verify this reporting convention by matching share loan transactions in the books of
one of the Dutch firms founded in 1720, Maatschappij van Assurantie, Discontering en
Belening der Stad Rotterdam [hereafter Stad Rotterdam, its modern name], with
share quotes in the Leydse Courant. Appendix 3 discusses this interpretation in some
detail. 11
By similar means we were also able to verify the assertion by Shea (2007) that, at
least in Holland, subscribers in shares were not obligated to pay the firm if they
chose to forego the shares. Shareholder subscription obligations were closed out
when shares were returned to the company in lieu of payment.
Prices in the Leydse Courant were often quoted as a daily range. In these cases, we
took the average of the range as the daily price. Prices for companies were also
quoted in more than one city. In these cases we used the prices for the market with
the most liquidity, defined as the market with the largest number of quotes during
the period of study. 12 Prices for the major British companies: The Bank of England,
the South Sea Company, the East India Company, the Royal Exchange Assurance
Company, the London Assurance Company, the York Building Society and a few
others were also quoted, suggesting that Dutch investors followed – and likely
traded in – British shares. This is consistent with the hypothesis in Neal (1990) that

Dale, Johnson, & Tang (2005) and Shea (2007) disagree on the question of whether South Sea
Company investors were obligated to continue loan payments when shares dropped in value.
11
Although the convention is useful for interpretation of the economic scale of the events of 1720 in
the Netherlands, it does not significantly affect the estimates of the bubble in share prices, since these
are calculated as percentages normalized either to previous prices or previous quotes.
12 Our database preserves the range and prices for multiple markets, allowing future research
analysis of such things as intra‐day volatility and information diffusion and investor bias among
cities, however these topics are not the focus of the current study.

Dutch investment capital flowed into Great Britain in 1720, pursuing equity
investment opportunities. News of the finances of France was also regularly
reported in the paper, and prices for the shares and related financial claims on the
Compagnie des Indes were quoted frequently. This suggests that Dutch investors
were interested in the daily fluctuations of the French firm and may have been
actively investing, at least in the year 1720. We are lacking the price information
before November 1719, so it is not possible to trace earlier Dutch investor interest
through this periodical.
The Leydse Courant also contains extensive interest rate and exchange rate
information on the same frequency. It quoted the agio (discount rate between
currency and money of account) for the Bank of Amsterdam, and exchange rates
between Amsterdam and a number of other cities, including London, Paris, Lisbon
and Hamburg. These are useful for future research as well.

Cross­sectional Differences in the South Sea Bubble
Figure 1 shows the stock price growth of the eight major London companies
regularly quoted in The Course of the Exchange and the other major price list, Freke’s
Price of Stocks Etc. over the period from November, 1719 through December, 1720.
The scale is logged to represent percentage changes and indexed to 1 at the
beginning of the available quotations for each series. 13 There are three striking
features of the graph. First, during the year 1720 all firms experienced, at a
minimum, a doubling of their share price. However, for three companies the prices
at the end of the year were at or below their beginning of year levels. 14 For these
firms the increase in share price during the first part of 1720 was a purely
temporary phenomenon, while for the others the run‐up had a permanent
component. Secondly, there is considerable cross‐sectional variation in the degree

of price run‐up. Although the events of 1720 are associated with the South Sea
Company, a few firms “bubbled” more dramatically than the South Sea Company,
when measured by price growth. In particular, the two marine insurance companies,
Royal Exchange Assurance and London Assurance rose to much higher multiples of
their original price during 1720. The Royal Africa Company (which, like the South
Sea Company, was engaged in the Atlantic slave trade) rose as high as the South Sea
Company in percentage terms as well. By contrast, the two banks, Bank of England
and Million Bank, as well as the East India Company (engaged in the South Asia
trade) rose much less than the other four. Our limited price data for the York
Building Company, a scheme that involved the development of waterworks in
London, the purchase of confiscated estates in Scotland and the sale of life insurance
and annuities, we cannot measure the increase over the first part of the year,
although we know from other evidence that the extent of its rise from its initial
offering price was similar to that of the marine insurance companies.

Figure 1

A final feature of interest in Figure 1 is the timing differences in the bubbles. The
two marine insurance companies and the York Building Company reached their
peak simultaneously in mid‐August of 1720 and then dropped sharply at least two
weeks before the crash spread to other major British firms.
The differences in scale and timing suggest multiple influences on investor
enthusiasm during 1720. Clearly not all company shares benefitted equally from
speculative demand. While it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from a small
sample of firms, it is natural to attribute the difference between the high growth of
the South Sea Company and Royal Africa on the one hand, and the modest growth of
the East India Company on the other, to the expectations about the Atlantic trade as
opposed to the South Asian trade. The new Dutch price data give us an opportunity
to test this. If there were different causes of the price run‐ups in Figure 1, reflecting
differential expectations of investors about the relative fortunes of companies
trading with the East versus the West, then these differences are likely to show up in
the Dutch market as well. On the other hand, if the price run‐ups of share prices in
London were largely idiosyncratic, it is unlikely to find a similar pattern overseas.

Figure 2 shows the rise and fall of investment in the Dutch East Indies Company and
the West Indies Company over the period of November, 1719 through December,
1720. The data are reported three times per week, so unlike the daily London
prices, they are discontinuous, and represented by markers in the figure rather than
by lines. The similarities between the Dutch and London markets are striking. First,
the run‐up in the Dutch market was much larger for the West Indies Company than
the East Indies Company. Second, the relative top‐to‐bottom variance of prices is
strikingly similar in both markets. The Dutch West Indies Company clearly bubbled
on the same scale as the South Sea Company and the Royal African Company, rising
by a factor of 7 over a very short interval. By comparison, the price of the Dutch
East Indies Company did not double and, like its British counterpart it fell below its
beginning of year value by the end of 1720.

11

The four major firms in Northern Europe engaged in Atlantic trade; the Mississippi
Company, the Royal Africa Company, the South Sea Company and the Dutch West
Indies Company all rose by factors of 7 to 10 in the global bubble. The two major
firms engaged in Asian trade, the Dutch and British East India companies, rose by
much less. This is evidence in favor of the hypothesis that investor sentiment
differed with respect to Atlantic vs. Asian trading companies, supporting the theory
that the South Sea Bubble may have been partly a function of expectations about
future Atlantic trade.
There is some supporting historical evidence for this hypothesis. The triangle trade
that brought manufactured goods to Africa, Africans as slaves to the New World and
plantation‐produced commodities to Europe was one of the most important
international economic institutions in the early modern era. It was just getting
underway in 1720 and thus future profits were a long way off at the time of the
bubble. Nevertheless, like the modern tech bubble, perhaps this future promise
sparked current investor enthusiasm.
Other international events at the time might have directed investor attention to the
Atlantic trade and encouraged broader commercial aspirations in the New World.
The short‐lived War of the Quadruple Alliance [1718‐1720] pitted Spain against
Britain, France, Austria and the Netherlands over control of Italy. The New World
territories from Texas to Florida were an important secondary theater of the
conflict. France fought to extend control over Spanish lands in Texas and New
Mexico from her settlement at the mouth of the Mississippi; the British in Carolina
threatened Spanish Florida. While a treaty in February, 1720 concluded the
hostilities in favor of the alliance, there was no major realignment of control in the
Americas. 15 Never‐the‐less, Spanish dominance in the New World was explicitly

15

In fact the concluded peace likely heightened the prospects for South Sea Company and Royal
African Company profitability, as the South Sea company expected to have the Spanish Asiento
reinstated following the war – the document granting rights to supply African slaves to Spanish
America. The South Sea Company had previously sourced slaves from the Royal African Company.

12

challenged, potentially raising interests and expectations among French, British and
Dutch investors about future New World inroads. 16
The commonality in the patterns of price run‐ups in Amsterdam and London
suggest a high degree of financial integration between these markets. 17 However, as
noted above the West Indies Company rose later than the South Sea Company or the
Royal Africa Company. Part of the difference can simply be attributed to time
keeping: there was an eleven‐day difference between the older Julian calendar used
in London and the newer Gregorian calendar used on the continent. But even
accounting for this time lag, there remains at least a month difference in the
beginning of a bubble trend. This suggests that any spill‐over of irrational (or
rational) exuberance ran from Britain to the Continent, not vice‐versa.
International Stock Market Crash
As we have seen, share prices in several companies rose dramatically in 1720, but
the timing of their take‐off differed. In this section we examine the timing of the
crash. Figure 3 shows the Dutch West Indies Company, Stad Rotterdam, the South
Sea Company and the two British insurance companies. The trading dates for the
British companies have been adjusted to the Gregorian calendar. Hereafter a G will
indicate a Gregorian date, and J a Julian date.

Figure 3
The prices are indexed to one at the start of each series, and the vertical axis is
logarithmic to allow comparison of the scale of the price changes on a percentage
basis. The two British insurance companies reached their peak on the same day –
August 26th [G], and began their drop on the 27th [G]. They both fell significantly
over the following four trading sessions. The Dutch West Indies Company reached
its peak on August 28th [G] and began its drop on the following trading day, August
31st. It, too, continued to fall significantly over the flowing several trading sessions.
Together, these three firms – aside from the Mississippi Company in France – were
the first major companies to crash in price in 1720. The crash in Royal African
Company shares began three weeks later on September 14th [G] and the crash in
South Sea Company shares began on September 19[G]. Since late August seems to
have been the important turning part in the London and Dutch stock markets, a
natural question to ask is what happened around August 27th [G], or August 16th [J]?

14

The Leydse Courant reported news about both the British insurance companies in its
edition of August 28th [G] noting that, on the 23rd of August [G] the Royal Assurance
Company was planning a new issue of shares for the following week, presumably to
raise the 50,000 pounds payment to the Exchequer promised by September 11 [G].
This payment was a condition of their charter granted as a result of the Bubble
Act. 18 The London Assurance Company was also required to deliver the same sum
on that date. The news also noted cryptically that the London Assurance Company
“kept silent and sought to learn the secrets of the other firm” presumably alluding to
some scandal. 19 This suggested that there was some asymmetric information of
potential importance to investors.
Not reported in the Courant, but known from the London Gazette of August 23rd [J] is
that the Attorney General issued a writ of scire facias on August 29th [G] against four
firms (including the York Building Company) seeking to expand their business
beyond their charter. This writ represented a serious risk to firms seeking broad
latitude. Although they were not named in the writ, it likely fed negative speculation
about the potential constraints to the aspirations two marine insurance firms to
expand into fire and life insurance. Although the write was ultimately annulled, the
reprieve came after the market crash.
Non‐legal factors may also have come into play around this time. The Leydse Courant
of September 2 [G] reported news from London dated August 30th [G] that a fleet of
twelve ships from Jamaica had been lost and they were insured by the London
Assurance Company for 72,000 pounds. 20 It noted the burglary of the home of one
of the directors of the company. 21 The insurance claim from the fleet and possibly
the burglary would have raised concerns about the capability of the firm to meet its
September payment deadline.

Thus, over the course of four days in late August, 1720, adverse news about the York
Building Company and the two major insurance companies hit the market and quite
likely triggered their rapid decline in price. Over the course of a week, all three
British firms declined roughly 30%. This decline is large enough to have caused
financial distress to speculators on margin. In this way it may have led to a broader
financial crisis sparked by caused by borrowers liquidating securities to cover
obligations.
Because they are reported in the Leydse Courant, we can track the dates on which
these same news items reached the Netherlands. The lag of three to four days
between the crash in London insurance companies and the Dutch West Indies
Company is not surprising. Koudijs (2009) calculates that the average 18th century
travel time of packet boats between London and Amsterdam was about three or
four days. Likewise, the lag of three to four days is confirmed by evident the Leydse
Courant’s dated bylines vs. publishing dates for London news. We might expect,
however, that some reports reached the Dutch capital markets through other
channels.
Thus, through public information sources, Dutch investors in the British bubble
companies as well as the Dutch West Indies Company would have known by August
29th about the financial plans and troubles of the British insurance firms. Also they
may also have known through private information sources that the Jamaica fleet
was wrecked. 22
It is not clear whether these reports were good news or bad for Dutch investors.
The West Indies Company was not engaged in the insurance trade, and the only
value‐relevant news about the new world (apart from the shipwrecks) might have
been the August 30 [G] report in London of the discovery of gold in Jamaica,
reported in the September 2 [G] Leydse Courant. The only source of propagation of
the crash is through the channel of financial distress. Investors in the West Indies
22

The Amsterdam insurance market would have had the same capabilities of learning about
Caribbean shipwrecks in a timely manner as the London market, since these affected underwriting
decisions regardless of who insured the ships.

16

Company who held British insurance shares on margin might have had to raise cash
by selling their Dutch assets. The Leydse Courant reported the prices of Royal
Exchange Assurance and the London Assurance intermittently for the trading days
July 6 [G] to August 24th [G], and for the York Building Company from July 19th [G]
to August 17th [G]. It seems reasonable to interpret this demand for news about
these firms as evidence of speculative interest in these securities among Dutch
investors. Interestingly enough, shares in Stad Rotterdam jumped by 15% from
August 28th to August 31st. Since the firm was created to compete with the British
insurance companies, the problems of a rival might have been viewed as an
opportunity. Stad Rotterdam did not crash until the end of September.
The coincidence of the price peaks for three British firms and the West Indies
Company seems best explained by the onset of a liquidity crisis in the international
stock markets – a crisis that overwhelmed the capital markets in the following two
months. The coincidence of the scire facias writ limiting British companies to their
charters seems to be the leading culprit in the events that sparked the crash,
although negative news about one of the British insurance firms also likely played a
role.
Beyond the micro‐question about what sparked the global financial crash, the one
thing we can determine from the time‐series of various stock prices is that, while
British and Dutch firms rose at different times over the course of the first eight
months of 1720, September and October were terrible months for all stocks. The
crash overwhelmed all stocks regardless of whether investor expectations were
based on prospects of Atlantic trade, maritime insurance or real estate deals.
One thing the rise in Dutch share prices reveals is that government re‐funding could
not have been the sole basis for the British bubble. No Dutch firm was launched to
imitate the financial operations of the Mississippi Company or the South Sea
Company. The fact other types of firms bubbled – including the West Indies
Company – suggests that the Mississippi and South Sea bubbles were not primarily
due to speculation about the debt‐equity swap as a financial innovation.

17

Cross­sectional Evidence from New Company Issues
The price bubbles in 1720 were accompanied in Britain and the Netherlands by a
wave of new company issues. The Leydse Courant provides price information for
many of the new firms launched in the Netherlands, however regular price
quotations for the new companies in London have not survived. There is, however,
some information to allow us to further examine the cross‐sectional differences in
the degree of exposure to investor enthusiasm. A satirical British print made in
1721, shortly following the crash, The Bubbler’s Mirror, lists a number of the well‐
known London issues along with the par value of the shares and the maximum
percentage over par achieved during the bubble. 23 This information is sufficient for
us to further quantify the cross‐sectional differences noted for the larger firms and
to determine the extent to which differences observed across industries – i.e.
Atlantic trade, insurance and banking carry through more generally. The data from
The Bubbler’s Mirror is reported in Appendix 1.
Table 1 shows the average growth by industry. The first column includes the large
firms previously studied. In the second column, we removed the Bank of England,
the Million Bank, the South Sea Company, the Royal Africa Company, the Royal
Exchange Assurance Company and the London Assurance Company from the
calculations. The one exception is the inclusion in both columns of the East India
Company as a basis for comparison.

In order to test the hypothesis that the British firms associated with the Atlantic
trade reached higher premia over par values, we performed a t‐test on the log
growth rates of the Atlantic trade firms and tested the null that the growth rate for
the East India Company was drawn from the same distribution. Despite the few
degrees of freedom, we were able to reject the null with greater than 85%
confidence for both specifications. 24 When the South Sea and Royal African
Companies were removed, the t‐test returned a probability value of 10.6%. This is
not surprising since the test in this specification has the minimum feasible degrees
of freedom.
The Table shows that insurance industry was the highest growth industry, although
it also had the highest cross sectional variation in rates: Four of the top seven firms
ranked by growth were insurance companies, and two of the last seven were
insurance companies. Column two shows that excluding the two top marine
insurance companies, Royal Exchange and London Assurance reduced the scale of
the bubble in insurance firms, but did not change its top rank. This is due to the fact
two firms (General Insurance and British Insurance) bubbled on a comparable scale
to their more widely traded cousins. A t‐test of the difference in mean growth rates

24

The test was performed for two specifications: simple growth rates and logged growth rates. In
growth rates, the t‐value was 4.25 on 3 df. For log growth the t‐value was 6.15 on 3 df. Both are
significant at traditional confidence levels. The important caveat is that the small sample and its
unknown distributional properties potentially limits the interpretation of parametric tests.

19

between insurance companies and all other firms in the sample yielded mixed
results. 25
The evidence strongly suggests that the exuberance of London investors was driven
by certain industries. While the Atlantic trade is the obvious candidate given the
fame of the South Sea Company, the data suggest that there was a major bubble –
perhaps even a larger bubble – in insurance.

The prominent position of the

insurance companies in the bubble was noted by contemporary observers; most
famously, John Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer who took a bribe of 20,000
pounds of South Sea stock in return for his political support of the firm. In his
unsuccessful defense before the House of Lords, Aislabie exclaimed of the two
insurance firms: “these two projects were founded in greater iniquity and
contributed more to the publick calamity than anything else.” 26
An interesting feature of the Bubble Act of June 9, 1720 which asserted
governmental control over chartering companies for limited purposes is that it did
not directly concern the South Sea Company. Rather, it chartered the London
Assurance and the Royal Exchange Assurance companies and explicitly limited the
chartering of competitors. It thus makes sense to look at the bubble in 1720 through
the lens of financial innovation in the insurance sector as much as from the
perspective of an event driven by massive government debt conversion, or
indiscriminant speculation in company shares. 27

25

A t‐test assuming differences in unknown variance between the samples yielded a probability
value of 22% for logged growth rates and .3% for raw growth rates.

Scott (1910,1912) p. 405.

The IPO Wave in the Netherlands
In the Netherlands, a number of new firms were capitalized in 1720, beginning in
July with the creation of Stad Rotterdam and extending through October of that
year. We collected data from the Leydse Courant for many of these new firms.

Figure 4

Figure 4 shows the major Dutch price series’ as well as a number of the additional
issues over the last six months of 1720. As noted previously, the East India Company
[OIC] rose only a little through the year and then dropped below its June level by the
end of 1720. The West Indies Company rose quite dramatically and raised additional
capital in two subscriptions in 1720 as its stock price rose. The most striking feature
22

of the figure is that, with the exception of Middelburg, which floated both an
insurance company and a commercial company, all the Dutch projects were
singularly associated with its own city. Gelderblom and Jonker (2009) point out
that this reflects the history of Dutch corporate development. The East India
Company resulted from a consolidation of trading companies in different cities.
Gelderblom and Jonker hypothesize that Dutch cities may have anticipated a similar
consolidation of the insurance trade, and thus the first move of Rotterdam might
have stimulated a rush to create similar projects that would result in a share of the
consolidated firm. If this were so, it would suggest that the Dutch viewed the
publicly traded corporate insurance company as an important and potentially
transformative financial innovation that had the power to become a dominant
organization. No city wished to be left out of the potential future gains to the
consolidation of the Rotterdam company into a huge national enterprise. This is
consistent with our hypothesis that speculation about the new insurance company
form was a major driver of the international bubble in share prices in 1720.
If the expectation of consolidation motivated the flurry of Dutch public offerings,
such a consolidation never materialized. The shares of Stad Rotterdam began
trading in mid‐July, after the peak of the South Sea Company, but a month before the
peak of the London and Royal Exchange Assurance companies. The firm made a
secondary offering a month later, and by that time many other companies had been
launched. Gouda, Delft and Schiedam were next, and they all followed a trajectory in
August and September. After a drop following their initial offerings their shares rose
sharply – increasing from the pre‐September lows by as much as 100% to 300%.
These brief spikes may not have been comparable in scale and duration to the
bubble in West India Company shares, but they were evidently perceived by some
market participants as such. The Dutch bubble was memorialized in late 1720 by a
famous satirical book of prints, plays and financial ephemera entitled Het Groote
Tafereel der Dwaasheid – The Great Mirror of Folly.
Following the entry of Gouda, Delft and Schiedam came a flood of new issues at the
end of September and the beginning of October; just as the global crisis hit London
23

and the Netherlands. Note the density of initial public offerings and transactions in
the Netherlands in September in this brief interval. The Dutch new issues market
lasted a brief two months. All shares traded down in November and towards the
close of the month trading dried up. Share quotations are virtually lacking in
December. The Leydse Courant stopped quoting share prices in January, 1721.
The financial bubble in Holland began later than the bubbles in France or Britain,
and it came to a conclusion with the crash in Britain with nearly precise correlation
to the fall in British insurance company shares. Except for the dramatic run up in
West Indies Company shares, the scale of the Dutch bubble was also somewhat
smaller. Appendix 2 reports the maximum trough to peak percentage gain for the
full sample of Dutch firms. The average was 127%; much lower than the average
maximum percentage gain in the London bubble. This is consistent with the claim of
Jonker and Gelderblom (2009) that the Dutch bubble was smaller in scale than the
British and French bubbles.
Assessing the economic significance of the bubble in the Netherlands based upon
the peak to trough range of prices may be misleading, however. The new Dutch data
support the relative importance of speculation about insurance. In Appendix 2 we
report the stated intent of the new Dutch firms launched in 1720, gathered from
their founding documents. Unlike the new British firms, which varied considerably
in their industrial classifications, most of the Dutch companies were established to
conduct commerce and trade. However, a majority of the companies included
insurance as one of their proposed lines of business. It is telling that the charter of
Stad Rotterdam mentions the competitive challenge of the new British insurance
companies in motivating the need to launch the firm. 28
The crash in the equity markets was a significant setback to this new financial
technology. The success of the public insurance corporation depended on the
external demand for shares and the availability of public investment capital. These
dried up with the global contraction of securities markets following the crash in
28

Anonymous, 1720, Het Groote Tafereel de Dwaasheid, p. 25.

24

Great Britain. Had the global crash not occurred, public investment in marine
insurance underwriting might have continued. After 1720, many of the new Dutch
firms closed and returned shareholder capital (or issued financial substitutes such
as life annuities). A few firms survived and prospered. The Middelburg commerce
company became a major player in the Atlantic economy – including the slave trade
– in the late 18th century. Stad Rotterdam also fulfilled the promise of the potential
of a publicly capitalized insurance corporation. It survived and prospered to become
one of the largest insurance companies in continental Europe, recently merging with
the financial giant Fortis.
The survival of Stad Rotterdam, London Assurance and Royal Exchange Assurance
into the modern era proved the long‐term viability of incorporated insurance
companies. Given that the average peak to trough price increase for most of the
Dutch companies was comparatively modest, it is difficult to view investors of the
time wild speculators. The underlying rationale for investing at the time – i.e. an
innovation in the financing of marine insurance underwriting, does not appear to
have been unreasonable.
Conclusion
The cross‐sectional evidence from British and Dutch firms in 1720 does not directly
allow a test of whether investment in shares at the time was economically rational.
Instead, it provides more information about the nature and timing of investor
expectations.
The data for major British companies suggests that expectations (rational or not)
about the Atlantic trade may have been an important factor. The differential
between the South Sea Company and the East India Company in the British market
is matched by the differential between the Dutch East and West Indies Companies.
This hypothesis is supported by a test of the size of the bubble using another data
set of “bubbles.” The bubble in other Atlantic‐trade firms, excluding the Royal Africa
Company and the South Sea Company, also exceeded the maximum growth in East
Indies Company shares in 1720.
25

We have price records for nine major firms over the year 1720; two from the
Netherlands and seven from Britain. Of these, the share prices for the three firms
engaged in the Atlantic trade: the South Sea company, the Royal African Company
and the Dutch West Indies Company were higher at the end of 1720 than at the
beginning. 29 Although their prices increased by multiples in the middle of the year
and the dropped considerably from their highs in 1720, as a group, they experienced
a permanent price improvement. Firms engaged in other industries had mixed
results. This cross‐sectional evidence suggests that the “bubble” may have been
based upon some fundamental common factor that justified a value increase. While
investor irrationality may have carried prices to many multiples of their post‐crash
value, the bubble speculation may have anticipated some long‐term permanent
effect.
The cross‐sectional data also show that speculation in insurance companies was
another important factor in the bubble. The chartering and incorporation of
insurance companies in the early 18th century was a financial innovation. It
extended the potentially valuable feature of limited liability to firms that dealt in
risk. Before this transition, insurance was provided by underwriters operating alone
or in syndicates that pooled capital. With the transition to corporations came
broader access to public capital. The new, liquid stock markets gave the public
insurance firms the capacity to increase their capital base and to diversify their
risks. These may have been perceived as valuable financial innovations at the time.
In summary, a view of the stock prices of more than thirty traded companies, and
the price gains in 1720 of another forty additional firms provides a useful
perspective on the bubbles in South Sea Company and Mississippi Company shares.
While the actions and price dynamics of these two major companies have
dominated the historical study of the period because of their major scale, a cross‐
sectional perspective suggests that the basis for speculative enthusiasm at the time

29

South Seas = 45% gain, Royal Africa = 91% gain and West Indies Company 51% gain.

26

may have been connected to long‐term prospects for Atlantic commerce, and the
recent innovation in the organizational form of insurance companies.

Appendix III
The interpretation of price quotes
One of the problems in the analysis of the price data from Holland in 1720 is the
question of how the price quotations should be interpreted. Share or subscription
prices were not quoted in currency, but in a percentage in excess of some value.
Scholars to date have disagreed on the interpretation of this value. We address this
basic question through examination of the language used in the price lists in 1720,
and by matching share loan transactions in the books of one company to the
documented market quotations. The benefit of matching price quotes to company
transactions in their shares is that the books were kept in units of currency.
Price quotes in the Leydse Courant typically were given in sentences such as:
”Rotterdam: Today the shares of our company were traded for prices ranging from
52 to 56 percent avans”. Intervals like this are not uncommon due to the high daily
volatility; especially in the rise of the bubble the morning prices differed
substantially from evening quotes. A key question posed by these quotes is of
course, what is meant by “avans”? What amount in the quotation in excess of? This
question is more challenging than it appears. Shares were issued through
subscriptions that required capital calls. Thus, the relevant multiplicand might be
interpreted as the capital paid in to the company up to that date [the paid in capital]
or it might be interpreted as the face value of the share after all the shareholder
installments are paid ‐‐ something we now often refer to as the par value or nominal
share value.
It is therefore not surprising that previous authors have debated the interpretation
of these quotes. For example:
Van Rijn (1899) presumed that the avans referred to the nominal (or fully paid in)
value of the share, and that additional paid‐in capital represented a fraction that
incremented the quoted price. 31
There is logical because newspaper percentages could not practically be based on
the amounts paid‐in. The paid‐in capital increased over time and the exact amount
paid‐in was therefore uncertain until the books were closed and the paid‐in
amounts computed. If newspaper percentages were based on the amount paid‐in,
31

”The furnishment up till 80% of the shares of the first subscription is also foolish and absurd, since
the amount furnished in these shares exceeds the market value of the original shares, i.e. 15% has
been paid in on the subscription shares, to demand an additional 65% would be highly unfair ... The
shares of the first subscription have already been traded at 38%, together with the paid‐in amount of
15% this makes 53 percent, if an additional 65% were to be paid in then these shares would be
worth 118%, this would be unreasonable …If … on the old shares 75% had been paid in, these would
now be worth 3750 guilders, so a share of 1000 guilders would be worth 750 guilders.”

31

the newspaper percentages would have to drop after the payment of an installment;
if the market share price does not change and more capital is paid‐in, the percentage
decreases by construction.
Smith (1919) concurs with this interpretation: ”The share price was recorded in
percentages “avans”, i.e. it indicated the percentages to be paid in excess of par
value, calculated based on the amount which, with respect to the nominal amount
traded by the company as installment was demanded.” 32 Likewise, Slechte (1982):
“In the first two months the prices fluctuated between 100 and 80%, but dropped in
September and October to 60%. The Rotterdam shares … were therefore on average
priced at 4000 guilders in this period.”
Despite their general agreement, none of the earlier authors offered empirical
evidence supporting their interpretations. Thus, we sought to reject or verify their
calculations of monetary share prices by matching transactions in the Leydse
Courant with company records.
After the burst of the bubble at the end of September 1720, the directors of Stad
Rotterdam made non‐recourse loans to directors using their shares as collateral. If
share prices fell during the maturity of the loan, the company incurred the loss. This
arrangement could be interpreted as beneficial to shareholders because it was a
means to reduce the “float” of shares by keeping directors from dumping into a
falling market. It could also be interpreted as pure self‐dealing by directors. In either
case, these transactions allow us to link the market quotes to currency‐valued
transactions.
On pages 37 and 142 of the general ledger of Stad Rotterdam, some of these share
loans are recorded in prices that match quotations reported in the Leydse Courant
for the same day. 33 Since the ledger accounts are recorded in guilders, we can
ascertain that the newspaper prices are reported in percentages of the nominal
share value (5000 guilders for the Rotterdam company). The losses incurred in
these loan transactions also appear on the profit and loss account of the Rotterdam
company (page 9 of the general ledger account).
A simple example of our interpretation is useful. Suppose that Rotterdam shares
[with 5,000 guilders nominal value] are trading for 2,500 guilders on a certain date
and that up until that date 1% had been paid in. Then the Leydse Courant would
quote of 49% avans would imply the following: ‘Rotterdam is trading today at 50%
(2,500/5000 * 100%) or 49% of the par value of the share above the paid‐in capital
((2,500‐1%*5,000)/5,000)*100%= 49%’.

32

Original Dutch text:”De koers werd genoteerd in procenten “avans”, dus men gaf aan hoeveel
procenten boven pari betaald moest worden, te berekenen over de geldsom, die, met betrekking tot
het verhandelde nominaal bedrag, door de compagnie als storting was geëischt.”

This convention was convenient during weeks of installment payments. It allowed
investors to distinguish between shares on which the installment has been paid and
shares on which the installment still needed to be paid.
