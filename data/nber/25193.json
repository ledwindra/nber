    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper evaluates the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most recent data collection efforts to classify business entities that engage in an extreme form of production fragmentation called \u201cfactoryless\u201d goods production. \u201cFactoryless\u201d goods-producing entities outsource physical transformation activities while retaining ownership of the intellectual property and control of sales to customers. Responses to a special inquiry on the incidence of purchases of contract manufacturing services in combination with data on production inputs and outputs, intellectual property, and international trade is used to identify and document characteristics of \u201cfactoryless\u201d firms in the U.S. economy.\n\n",
