Signaling Credibility – Choosing Optimal Debt and International Reserves

NBER Working Paper No. 12407

JEL No. F31, F34, F36
ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the challenges facing developing countries when there is uncertainty about the
policy maker type. We consider a country characterized by volatile output, inelastic demand for
fiscal outlays, high tax collection costs, and sovereign risk, where future output depends on the type
of policymaker in place today. There are two policymakers -- type T chooses debt and international
reserves to smooth tax collection costs; type S has higher discount factor, aiming at obtaining current
resources for narrow interest groups, and preferring not to undertake costly reforms that may enhance
future output. Financial markets do not know the type of policymaker in place and try to infer its type
by looking at its financial choices. We show that various adverse shocks (lower output, higher real
interest rate, etc.) can induce a switch from an equilibrium where each policy maker chooses its
preferred policy to another where T distorts its policies in order to separate itself from S in the least
costly way. This is accomplished by type T reducing both international reserves and external debt.
Further decline in output would induce type T to lower debt, and reserves would fall at a higher rate
than otherwise expected.

Lula's leap; Popular, but no populist
…The victory of a worker born dirt-poor in Brazil's poverty-stricken north-east was celebrated as a victory for
poor people everywhere. Yet Lula did not turn out to be a populist like Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Instead of
spending recklessly, reigniting inflation and perhaps defaulting on debt as Argentina has done, Lula clamped
down on inflation and saved extra money to pay the debt… Spurred by a devaluation in 1999 and buoyant
demand for commodities, exports have boomed, turning a current-account deficit into surplus. Mr Palocci has
used the inflow of dollars to pay off foreign creditors, including the IMF. Soon, Brazil will no longer have to
worry about a falling real driving up its debt burden. The risk premium has fallen to a record low of two
percentage points.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the history of sovereign debt, there have been numerous episodes in which countries
have rapidly accumulated large debts in short periods, which have led to debt servicing problems
later on. A case in point is the experience of many Latin American countries in the late nineteen
seventies. Consistent with this pattern, several models have explored the consequences of
having governments with high discount factors trying to get as much resources as possible while
they are in office. If countries with governments that maximize current resources have weaker
growth prospects –for this very reason- than those with governments that have more long-term
objectives in mind, then financial markets will treat these different types of countries in different
ways. Given the widespread prevalence of short-sighted governments, prudent governments
who take the long view may find it difficult to convince investors that they are not of the shortsighted type.
The recent history of Argentina and Brazil provides an intriguing case study. Both
countries were challenged by similar macroeconomic maladies in the 1980s – high inflation and
fiscal deficiencies. Both had weak federal systems, plagued with common pool problems, where
provincial states had the incentive to over borrow, necessitating federal government bail-outs,
frequently through excessive monetization. The regime changes of the early 1990s led to rapid
disinflation in both countries. Nevertheless, they adopted sharply different exchange rate
systems. Argentina chose a currency board, rigidly pegging the peso to the US dollar. In
contrast, Brazil put greater emphasis on reducing the bargaining power of provincial states, and
on managed flexibility of the exchange rate. These policies, and the external shocks of the
1990s, put them in sharply different positions during the last five years. Argentina ended up
defaulting on its internal and external debt and its leaders may be writing another chapter in the

2
populist annals of Latin America [LATAM]. Brazil has managed to steer away from default, a
remarkable task considering Lula’s political background. As the lead quotation reveals, Lula’s
task has been complicated by the need to earn credibility during a time of reemerging populism
in LATAM.1
In this paper, we develop a model in which a government, using debt and reserves to
smooth tax collection costs, has to be cautious about not being mistaken for one seeking to
maximize current resources. Our results can shed light on the new situation that, although not as
common as over-borrowing in LATAM, has certainly occurred: the case of a rapidly declining
debt, partially financed by recently accumulated international reserves. Our model does not
address the fundamental reasons why political leaders may differ in their objectives. Specifically,
we don’t attempt to explain their effective discount rates nor their attitudes towards present
consumption versus investment in enduring but painful reforms. Taking these things as given,
we identify situations that may lead to contrasting choices, akin to the ones observed recently in
LATAM.
We consider a developing country characterized by volatile output, inelastic demand for
fiscal outlays, high tax collection costs and sovereign risk. There are two types of policymakers,
differing in their preferences. One, dubbed tough (T), chooses its debt and international reserves
to smooth tax collection costs, maximizing the representative agent expected utility.
International Reserves can extend smoothing to bad states of nature where default is likely –
provided they are beyond the reach of creditors. Thus, both debt and international reserves play
a role in optimally smoothing tax collection costs.
The second type of policymaker, soft (S), is interested in obtaining resources for special
interest groups while it is in office and acts with a high effective discount rate. Its choice of debt
and international reserves is thus tilted towards obtaining current resources for these groups. We
assume that the differential discount factors of the two policy makers have repercussions for
future output. Since the soft policymaker has a higher discount rate, it will not undertake reforms
or investment to the extent that the tough policymaker will. Hence, the future expected output
would be lower under the soft policy maker.

See Miller et. al. (2003) for an early assessment of the challenges facing the Lula’s
administration due to market fears of an untried Left-wing candidate. See Aizenman (2005) for an
overview of the divergent paths of Argentina and Brazil in the last fifteen years.

3
When investors have full information about the policy maker type, the soft policy maker
ends up with higher debt and lower international reserves, as in Aizenman and Marion (2004).
The focus of our paper is on the case where market participants do not know the type of
policymaker in place, but try to infer its type by looking at its financial choices. 2 We identify
conditions under which the equilibrium outcome entails two distinct policy regimes. In the first,
each policy maker makes the same choices they would when markets have full information,
thereby revealing their type to financial markets. We refer to this equilibrium as the undistorted
policy regime. In the second policy regime, the soft policy maker has the incentive to mimic the
tough, inducing the tough to distort its policies so as to differentiate itself in the least expensive
way. The result is that the tough policy maker opts for lower debt and international reserves
while the soft policy maker chooses its undistorted policy choices (i.e. the same choices it would
make if investors knew its type). We call this the distorted policy regime and the equilibrium
that results is the Least Costly Separating (LCS) Equilibrium.
Adverse shocks, like high international risk free interest rates, or low current output
induce the switch from the undistorted regime to the distorted regime. Below a threshold level
of current output, further decline in output induces lower debt instead of higher – as would be
expected – and reserves fall at a higher rate than otherwise expected. This adjustment may be
viewed as a ‘test of fire’ imposed on the tough policy maker in bad times. We also show that the
cost of sovereign default is an important determinant of the range of the distorted policy regime.
A low enough default penalty induces a switch from the undistorted policy regime to the
distorted policy regime for a given level of output. Similarly, a drop in the expected future
output that a soft policy maker can achieve induces a shift from the undistorted to the distorted
policy regime for certain parameter values.
These results imply that political uncertainty is a key variable impacting the association
between output shocks and the patterns of debt and international reserves.

See Acharya and Diwan (1993) and Fernandez-Ruiz (2000) for models in which countries’ financial choices –
especially debt buybacks – act as signals in the context of the debt relief packages (mainly the Brady deals) offered
to debt-ridden economies in the early nineties.

4
2. THE MODEL
We consider an extension of Aizenman and Marion (2004). The model has three basic
ingredients.

i) There are two types of policymakers. The tough (T) – or responsible one – chooses its debt
and international reserves to smooth tax collection costs in a setting with volatile output, inelastic
demand for fiscal outlays, high tax collection costs and sovereign risk. Debt can accomplish this
smoothing only when the country has access to international capital markets -in good states of
nature. International Reserves can extend smoothing to bad states of nature –provided they are
beyond the reach of creditors. Thus, both debt and international reserves play a role in optimally
smoothing tax collection costs.
The soft (S) policymaker is interested in obtaining resources for special interest groups with high
discount rates. Its choice of debt and international reserves is thus tilted towards obtaining
current resources.

ii) We consider the particular case in which current policy choices impact future output. We can
envision a simple setting in which this occurs. There are reforms that require a sacrifice today in
exchange for higher future output. Since the soft policymaker has higher discount rates, it will
not undertake these reforms to the extent that the tough policymaker will. Thus, future output
will depend on the type of policymaker in place today.

iii) Financial markets do not know the type of policymaker in place, but try to infer its type by
looking at its financial choices.

We consider the two-state case in which second-period output can take only two values:
Y2 ∈ {Yl , Yh } , with Yl = 1 − δ , Yh = 1 + δ , and δ > 0. The tough policymaker induces a
distribution for the second-period output in which Y2 = Yh with probability ½, while the soft
policymaker induces a distribution with Pr ( Y2 = Yh ) = p < ½. (This can be thought of as the
result of a choice of whether or not to exert some costly effort in the first period).

5
Although financial markets do not know the type of policymaker in place, they assign a prior
probability of φ to the policymaker being soft. This implies that they assign a prior probability
of p M ≡ φp + (1 − φ )(1 / 2) to the country obtaining a high second-period output.

The Credit Market
The country can borrow internationally an amount B in period 1 at a contractual interest rate r, so
that it owes (1 + r) B in period 2. In the second period, the country repays the amount owed,
(1 + r) B, if this is less costly than the default penalty, αY .
So, actual repayment in period 2 equals:
S 2 = min{(1 + r ) B, αY2 }

(1)

Since maximum repayment cannot exceed αYh , let us restrict attention to debt values B with
(1+r) B ≤ αYh .
We assume international competitive markets, so that creditors will demand an expected
repayment equivalent to the risk-free interest rate r f :

E ( S 2 ) = (1 + r f ) B ; which can be written as:
[1 − Pr(Y2 = Yh )]αYl + Pr(Y2 = Yh )(1 + r ) B = (1 + r f ) B
r = rf

if B >
if B ≤

αYl
(1 + r f )

αYl

.

(2)

(1 + r f )

This equation implicitly defines the supply of credit. Clearly, this supply depends on the
probability that financial markets assign to the country obtaining a high second period-output,
Pr(Y2 = Yh ) . Since Pr(Y2 = Yh ) is different depending on the type of policymaker, the supply of
credit will also be different depending on the type of policymaker that financial markets believe
they are facing.
Let r t be the (implicitly) defined value of r satisfying (2) when Pr(Y2 = Yh ) =1/2. Thus, r t is the
interest rate charged to a policymaker believed to be tough.
Similarly, Let r s be value of r satisfying (2) when Pr(Y2 = Yh ) = p <1/2: it is the interest rate
charged to a policymaker believed to be soft.

6
Finally, let us define for future reference r M as the interest rate charged to a policymaker
believed to be soft with the prior probability φ . r M satisfies (2) when Pr(Y2 = Yh ) = p M .
Since p s < p M < 1 / 2 , we will have that, for any given B,
rt < rM < rs

if B >

r t = r M = r s = rf

if B ≤

αYl
(1 + r f )

αYl
(1 + r f )

When debt is risky, a policymaker perceived to be tough will be charged an interest rate lower
than that charged to a policymaker perceived to be soft, while a policymaker whose type is
unknown will receive an offer that is a weighted average of the two, determined by the prior: φ .
The following figure illustrates this point. It also illustrates the fact that the maximum debt that a
country can obtain in period 1 increases with Pr(Y2 = Yh ) . Thus, the soft policymaker can obtain
fewer resources than one with unknown type who, in turn, can obtain less than the tough type.

Complete Information

Consider first a setting with complete information: each type of policymaker chooses its
preferred policy under the assumption that financial markets know which type it is. Government
revenue in the first period is obtained by a combination of taxes, T, and borrowing B. The
revenue is financing government expenditure, G, and hoarding international reserves, R. The
second period government expenditure, G, and debt repayment is financed by tax revenue and
international reserves. Collecting taxes is associated with deadweight loss, which reduces net
output at a rate Γ. This rate depends positively on government net expenditure/GDP ratio,
denoted by ξ. Under these assumptions, the representative agent’s consumption can be reduced
to Y (1 − ξ − Γ(ξ )) .3
We assume that financial decisions (sovereign debt and reserves) are made before fiscal
decisions. Hence, the creditors lending decisions take place prior to setting the tax rate and the
actual fiscal expenditure on fiscal consumption, G. The tough policymaker will choose debt (B)
and reserves (R) to maximize:

The deadweight loss may be viewed as tax enforcement and collection costs. In these circumstances, a tax rate t
paid by the representative consumer yields tax revenue net of collection costs of Y [t − Γ] , where

Γ = Γ(t ); Γ ' ≥ 0, Γ " ≥ 0. The fiscal budget constraint linking consumer’s tax rate, t, with the fiscal revenue
needs net of tax collection and enforcement costs defines a tax Laffer curve, t − Γ (t ) = ξ , implicitly defining the
consumer tax rate as a function of the net fiscal revenue needs, t = t (ξ ) . Consequently, consumption C is a
function of the net fiscal needs, C = Y (1 − t ) = Y [1 − ξ − Γ(t (ξ )] . See Aizenman and Marion (2004) for further
details.

8
r t is the interest rate charged to a policymaker believed to be tough, defined by equation (2)
when Pr(Y2 = Yh ) =1/2 .
We assume that the deadweight cost of taxes, Γ(ξ (t )) = 0.5λt 2 , is quadratic in the tax rate.
Debt and reserves allow the government to smooth both consumption and tax collection
costs. We will for simplicity consider the case of risk-neutrality, so that the smoothing of tax
collection costs will be the only underlying motive behind the use of debt and reserves.
Let ( B t , R t ) be the solution to this problem. It is the full information benchmark policy for the
tough type. In the next section, when markets are unsure about the type of the policy maker, this
benchmark policy is chosen in what will be called the undistorted policy regime.
The soft policymaker is interested in maximizing a different objective function. It will
choose B and R to maximize the present value of the resources it obtains from capital markets to
distribute among special interest groups, using a discount rate ρ s > ρ :
Max V s ( B, R, r s ) =
[Tm (Y1 ) + B − R] +

1
{ p[Tm (Yh ) + R(1 + r f ) − (1 + r s ) B] + (1 − p )[Tm (Yl ) + R(1 + r f ) − αYl ]} ,

where r s is the interest rate charge to a policymaker believed to be soft ( Pr(Y2 = Yh ) = p <1/2),
and Tm (Y ) denotes the maximum net tax revenue attainable.5
Let ( B s , R s ) be the solution to this problem. It is the full information benchmark policy for the
soft type. The fact that r f < ρ s implies that:

Rs = 0 , Bs =

α [(1 − p)Yl + pYh ]
1 + rf

.

Under complete information, the soft policymaker holds no reserves and contracts as much debt
as possible, to obtain an utility equal to

9

Incomplete Information

We now turn our attention to the case in which the policymaker is privately informed about its
type. Financial markets hold a prior probability of φ that this type is soft. The policymaker
chooses a financial policy (B, R) and, upon observing this choice, creditors update the prior
probability φ , and charge an interest rate according to this updated probability.
When financial markets do not know the type of policymaker, a main concern for the tough
policymaker is that it may be mistaken for a soft policymaker. We now address this concern,
which will be at the heart of our analysis.
We first compute for future reference the utility the soft policymaker obtains when it mimics the
tough policymaker and is treated as such by financial markets. In such a situation the soft
policymaker will obtain utility of
V s (Bt , R t , r t ) =
[Tm (Y1 ) + B t − R t ] +

1
{ p[Tm (Yh ) + R t (1 + r f ) − (1 + r t ) B t ] + (1 − p )[Tm (Yl ) + R t (1 + r f ) − αYl ]} .
s
1+ ρ

By mimicking the financial choice of the tough policymaker, the soft policymaker obtains an
interest rate, r t , lower than r s . This comes at the cost of distorting its otherwise optimal
financial policy.

Notice also that the tough policymaker will never want to imitate the soft policymaker:
V t ( B s , R s , r s ) < V t ( B t , R t , r t ) . This follows from the fact that:
i) given the interest rate r t , shifting to the soft policy maker’s benchmark

policies ( B s , R s ) decreases its welfare. By construction, ( B t , R t ) is welfare maximizing for that
interest rate, V t ( B s , R s , r t ) < V t ( B t , R t , r t ) .
ii) Given ( B s , R s ) , an increase in the interest rate from r t to r s cannot increase

welfare, V t ( B s , R s , r s ) ≤ V t ( B s , R s , r t ) .
Let TSE be the utility the soft type obtains by following benchmark policy, less the utility it
obtains by imitating the tough type and receiving the interest rate r t :

10
TSE ≡ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) - V s ( B t , R t , r t ) .

We have now two different scenarios.
i) If TSE > 0, the soft policymaker is better-off sticking to its undistorted

benchmark policy rather than picking the tough type’s benchmark policy. In that case,
each policymaker will choose its benchmark policy and financial markets will learn
from these choices the type of policymaker they are facing. We will call this the
undistorted policy regime.
ii) If TSE < 0, then the soft policymaker is better-off imitating the tough

policymaker. In this case, a choice of ( B t , R t ) would no longer convince the markets
that a tough policymaker made such a choice. Thus, the above undistorted choice will
no longer be a separating equilibrium. As we will show, the tough policy maker will
then distort its choice of debt and reserves to separate itself from the soft policy
maker. We will call this the distorted policy regime.
Substituting V s ( B s , R s , r s ) and V s ( B t , R t , r t ) we have that

(

TSE =

pα (1 + δ ) + (1 − p)α (1 − δ ) pα (1 + δ ) + (1 − p)α (1 − δ )

1+ ρ s

.

− Bt + Rt −
{(1 + rf ) Rt − 2 p(1 + rf ) Bt − α (1 − δ )(1 − 2 p)}
1+ ρ s

It is instructive to see how different variables affect the value of TSE and thus, which of the
two equilibria will prevail. By differentiating TSE we find that:
i) A reduction in the probability that the soft type obtains a high future output (a lower p) or a

reduction in current output ( Y1 ) will reduce TSE and induce a shift to the distorted policy regime
for certain parameter values (See Figure 2):
∂TSE
> 0,
∂p

∂TSE
>0 .
∂Y1

(3)

To gain some insight, let us first examine a reduction in p, the probability that the soft
government obtains a high output. This reduction leaves ( B t , R t ) unchanged. But it affects TSE
through two different channels: i) it reduces the utility the soft government obtains by following

11
its complete information policy ( B s , R s ) , because it reduces the amount of resources it can
borrow, and ii) it increases the cross-subsidization it obtains if it mimics the tough policymaker
policy ( B t , R t ) . Both effects make it more tempting for the soft government to mimic the tough
one.
Let us now examine a reduction in Y1 . It affects TSE only through its effect on ( B t , R t ) . By
increasing B t and reducing R t , it increases the utility a soft government obtains from imitating a
tough one.
Figure 2 illustrates the equilibrium zone we will be in as p and Y1 change. In the top panel, it
shows that either a reduction in p for a given Y1 , or a reduction in Y1 for a given p, can moves us
away from the undistorted policy regime. It also shows in its bottom panel the optimal
undistorted policy for the tough government, which explains the effect of Y1 . As Y1 decreases,
the tough type would like to increase debt and reduces reserves. Both movements make it more
tempting for the soft government to imitate the tough one.

ii) We now analyze changes in the risk-free interest rate ( r f ) and the penalty creditors can

inflict ( α ). These variables have two different effects on TSE: i) They influence TSE for a given
value of ( B t , R t ) , and ii) they have an indirect effect in TSE through its impact on ( B t , R t ) . We
have that, for a range of parameters where the first (direct) effect is higher than the second
(indirect) effect, an increase in the risk-free interest rate ( r f ) or a decrease in the penalty
creditors can inflict ( α ) increases the likelihood that the tough policymaker abandons its
undistorted benchmark policy:

An increase in the risk-free interest rate, r f , or a reduction in the amount of output creditors
can recover for sure, α , both reduce the amount of resources an opportunistic government can
get when not trying to imitate the tough policy maker. This reduces TSE. However, an increase
in r f also produces a mitigating effect by decreasing B t and increasing R t . This effect is usually
outweighed by the former effect.

Figure 3 shows in the (r f , p ) space whether or not we will have an undistorted policy
equilibrium. It shows in its bottom panel that an increase in r f induces a tough policymaker to
reduce debt and increase reserves, actions that the soft type dislikes. This gives the soft type less
incentive to imitate the tough type. The top panel in figure 3 shows that this (indirect) effect is
outweighed by the reduction in the amount a soft government can get when pursuing its
benchmark policy. Thus, for a range of values for p, we abandon the undistorted policy
equilibrium as r f increases.

Equilibrium policies when the benchmark policies are abandoned.

We now search for the equilibrium behavior when the benchmark policies do not form an
equilibrium (TSE < 0). It turns out that, under certain conditions, we will have a separating
equilibrium in which
i) The soft policy maker chooses its full information policy,

(B s , R s ) = (

α [(1 − p)Yl + pYh ]
1 + rf

,0) , and

ii) The tough policymaker does not choose its full information benchmark policy. Instead, it

chooses the policy ( B tc , R tc ) that allows it to separate itself from the soft policy maker in the
least costly way. It is the Least Costly Separating (LCS) policy.
More formally, ( B tc , R tc ) is the solution to the problem:

We claim that, under certain conditions,
i) The above strategies do provide an equilibrium.
ii) It is the most reasonable equilibrium, and
iii) There are no pooling equilibria.

Before explaining why this is so, let us first comment that the LCS equilibrium differs from
the full information benchmark policies only in the policy chosen by the tough type. Here the
tough type will choose the LCS policy ( B tc , R tc ) instead of the full information policy ( B t , R t ) .
Under certain regularity conditions, it turns out that the tough type reduces both debt and
reserves to separate itself from the soft type, B tc < B t and R tc < R t . Figure 5 illustrates this
point by plotting the equilibrium value of debt (top panel) and reserves (bottom panel) as a
function of r f both under the undistorted and the LCS policies.

16
To gain some insight on why this is so, consider the problem from which the LCS policy
( B tc , R tc ) arises:
Max V t ( B, R, r t )
s.t. V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) (IC).
This problem is equal to the problem giving rise to the complete information policy ( B t , R t ) ,
except for (IC), the incentive compatibility constraint. This constraint tells us that the tough
policymaker has to choose a policy that the soft policymaker does not find attractive to imitate.
Notice how debt and reserves affect this constraint:
i) A decrease in debt relaxes the constraint for two reasons. First, since the soft policymaker

has a high discount rate, it prefers to borrow more debt, even if this is done at interest rates that
reflect its true probability distribution (p) over future output. Second, the soft policymaker
receives a cross-subsidization when it is treated as a tough policymaker. This cross-subsidization
is higher as debt increases.
ii) An increase in reserves relaxes the constraint. This, again, is because the soft policymaker

has a high discount rate, and increasing reserves translate valuable current resources to the future
(without increasing cross-subsidization).

So, reductions in debt and increases in reserves can be used to meet the (IC) constraint. One
would expect the tough policymaker to optimally resort to both. This is not so because of two
facts:
i) A debt reduction has a more powerful effect on the constraint than an increase in reserves.

By reducing debt, a soft policymaker not only loses the chance to spend current resources (which
also happens by increasing reserves), but also by the mis-pricing implicit in the crosssubsidization (this effect is not present when reserves are varied).
ii) Debt and Reserves are complements in the tough policymaker problem. So, as Debt is

reduced, it is also less attractive to hold Reserves. This effect is powerful enough so that, in
equilibrium (under certain regularity conditions), the tough policymaker reduces both Debt and
Reserves to separate himself from the soft policymaker.

17
We can interpret Figure 5 as showing a situation in which doubts appear about the type of
policymaker in place. These doubts force him to prove that he is tough, moving him to the
distorted policy curves. In this figure the parameter values selected are such that we are in the
distorted equilibrium zone for the whole range of values considered for r f . But, as we have seen
above, changes in r f or in other parameters can be the cause of moving from one type of
equilibrium to another.
Figure 6 shows this fact. There, we can see that as r f increases we move from the
undistorted policy regime to the distorted regime. This implies that beyond a certain point,
further increases in r f are met with a sharp decrease in debt coupled with a reduction (instead of
an increase) in reserves.

Figure 7 performs a similar exercise for current output. It is constructed for parameter values
such that the cutoff point between the two zones is precisely a value for current output Y1 = 1 : for
Y1 < 1 we will be in the distorted equilibrium zone. This implies that, as output falls below Y1 = 1 ,

debt will decrease instead of grow –as would be predicted by the benchmark curve- and reserves
will fall at a higher rate than otherwise expected. The intuition for this result is similar to the
previous ones: as output falls below Y1 = 1 , the (IC) constraint becomes tighter, and the optimal
response is to reduce both debt and reserves.

Figure 8 shows a similar pattern for α , which captures how much foreign borrowers can be
sure of being repaid. Again, as α decrease we abandon the undistorted policy regime, which
implies a reduction in both debt and reserves higher than predicted by the full information policy.

Let us now go back to the question of whether this is really an equilibrium. Before proving
that this is indeed the case, let us mention first that the crucial point is to be sure that the tough

19
policymaker (weakly) prefers to avoid being perceived as the soft type even though this requires
distorting its benchmark policy.

Figure 8

Consider the tough policymaker’s alternative of being perceived as soft:
Max V t ( B, R, r s )
With (1 − p )αYl + p (1 + r s ) B = (1 + r f ) B if B > αYl /(1 + r f ) ; r s = r f otherwise.
It turns out that the optimal choice for B, B ts , decreases as the probability of obtaining a high
output, p, decreases, because this implies an increase in the interest rate charged for any
B > αYl /(1 + r f ) . Our assumption regarding the solution to this problem will be a sufficient (not
necessary) condition for the tough policymaker to prefer not to be treated as soft.

20
We will assume that there exists p* >0 such that B ts (p*) = αYl /(1 + r f ) (a condition satisfied

in all the simulations performed above). A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for this to
occur is that the tax collection marginal cost function Γ' (ξ ) is bounded.
To see this, notice that, after replacing (1 + r s ) from the supply curve into the objective
function, the derivative with respect to B for B > αYl /(1 + r f ) will be equal to
(1 + r f )
dV t ( B, R, r s ( B))
= {1 + Γ' (ζ 1 )} −
{1 + Γ' (ζ h )} .
2 p (1 + ρ )
dB

This expression will eventually turn negative as we reduce p, provided that Γ' (ζ 1 ) is bounded.
Assume now that p < p M ≡ φp + (1 − φ )(1 / 2) < p*.
When this is the case, we can show the equilibrium results previously announced:

Result 1: If p < p* then:

It is an equilibrium for the tough type to choose ( B tc , R tc ) and for the soft type to choose
(B s , R s ) = (

α [(1 − p )Yl + pYh ]
1 + rf

, 0) .

Proof:

Consider the following out-of-equilibrium beliefs:
A policymaker is perceived as being tough if it chooses a pair ( B, R ) such that
V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) , and is perceived as soft otherwise.
i) The soft policymaker has no incentives to deviate to any pair ( B, R) with

V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) because even under the most favorable beliefs –leading to an

interest rate r t - its welfare would decrease. It will never deviate to any pair ( B, R ) with
V s ( B, R, r t ) > V s ( B s , R s , r s ) either because, given the out-of-equilibrium beliefs stated above, it

would lead to the belief that it is soft, and ( B s , R s ) is the optimal policy choice among the pairs
leading to that belief.
ii) Let us now turn our attention to the tough policymaker. It will not deviate to any pair

( B, R) with V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) because the equilibrium pair ( B tc , R tc ) maximizes its

21
welfare precisely among the pairs ( B, R) that satisfy such a condition when the interest rate r t
is charged.
Consider now a deviation in which V s ( B, R, r t ) > V s ( B s , R s , r s ) . Given the out-ofequilibrium beliefs specified above, it will be perceived as soft. Then, it cannot obtain more than
( B ts , R ts ) , which is the solution to the problem
Max V t ( B, R, r s )
with (1 − p )αYl + p (1 + r s ) B = (1 + r f ) B if B > αYl /(1 + r f ) , r s = r f otherwise.
Our assumption of p < p* implies that B ts = αYl /(1 + r f ) . Thus:
ii.a) V s ( B ts , R ts , r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) because

V s ( B ts , R ts , r t ) = V s ( B ts , R ts , r s ) < V s ( B s , R s , r s ) ; where the equality follows from the fact that

when B ts =

αYl
1 + rf

there is sure repayment and thus r s = r t = r f , and the inequality follows from

the fact that
( B s , R s ) is the optimal choice for the soft type when the interest rate r s is applied.
ii.b) V t ( B ts , R ts , r t ) ≤ V t ( B tc , R tc , r t ) since, by ii.a), the policy choice ( B ts , R ts ) is feasible in

the problem defining ( B tc , R tc ) .
ii.c) V t ( B ts , R ts , r s ) = V t ( B ts , R ts , r t ) , because, again, there is sure repayment for this debt

level: r s = r t = r f when B ≤ αYl /(1 + r f )
ii.d) from (ii.b) and (ii.d), it follows that V t ( B ts , R ts , r s ) ≤ V t ( B tc , R tc , r t ) , and the deviation

is not profitable.
Result 2: If p M ≡ φp + (1 − φ )(1 / 2) < p*, then there is no pooling equilibrium.

Proof:
i) When p M < p*, the solution to the following problem

Max V t ( B, R, r M )
with (1 − p M )αYl + p M (1 + r M ) B = (1 + r f ) B if B > αYl /(1 + r f ) ; r M = r f otherwise,

22
is given by B M = αYl /(1 + r f ) . That is, for a low enough value of p M , the tough policymaker
utility is maximized by choosing a debt level low enough to eliminate all cross-subsidization.
ii) Suppose that there is a pooling equilibrium ( B p , R p ) with B p > αYl /(1 + r f ) . Notice that

the interest rate charged in this equilibrium must be r M as defined above. Then,
V t ( B p , R p , r M ) < V t ( B M , R M , r M ) by revealed preference: ( B p , R p ) ≠ ( B M , R M ) , where

( B M , R M ) is the optimal choice for the tough policymaker when it faces the interest rate when
markets perceive a probability p M of obtaining a high output .
But, given the choice of B M = αYl /(1 + r f ) , the loan will be repaid for sure and the interest
rate charged will be r f , no matter how the policymaker is perceived. We will thus have
V t (B M , R M , r M ) = V t (B M , R M , r s )

Thus, the tough policymaker will find it profitable to deviate to ( B M , R M ) irrespective of the
markets beliefs. So, there are no beliefs that can sustain the supposed equilibrium.
iii) Suppose that there is a pooling equilibrium ( B p , R p ) with B p ≤ αYl /(1 + r f ) . Now the

soft policymaker will find it profitable to deviate. This is because
V s (B p , R p , r M ) = V s (B p , R p , r s ) < V s (B s , R s , r s ) ,

where the equality comes from the fact that when the debt level B p ≤ αYl /(1 + r f ) is
chosen, r M = r s = r f , and the inequality comes from ( B s , R s ) (which is different from
( B p , R p ) ) being the optimal choice for the soft policymaker when facing r s .
By deviating from the debt level B p ≤ αYl /(1 + r f ) to ( B s , R s ) , the soft policymaker goes
back to its choice of maximum debt and zero reserves while renouncing to no cross-subsidization
at all.

Result: 3 The least costly separating equilibrium, in which the soft policymaker chooses

( B s , R s ) and the tough policymaker chooses ( B tc , R tc ) , satisfies the intuitive criterion of Cho
and Kreps. There are no other separating equilibria satisfying such criterion.

i) In any separating equilibrium the soft policymaker chooses ( B s , R s ) .

23
To see why, suppose to the contrary that there is a separating equilibrium in which the soft
policymaker chooses ( B s1 , R s1 ) ≠ ( B s , R s ) . By adhering to this equilibrium policy, the soft
policymaker will be charged the interest rate r s , since in any separating equilibrium the true type
of each policymaker is revealed. If it instead deviates to its full information policy, it will be
charged no more than r s and obtain no less than V s ( B s , R s , r s ) . Since ( B s , R s ) maximizes the
soft policymaker’s welfare when facing r s , V s ( B s1 , R s1 , r s ) < V s ( B s , R s , r s ) , and it will prefer
to defect to its full information policy. This contradicts the assumption.
ii) Consider a separating equilibrium in which the soft policymaker chooses ( B s , R s ) and the

tough policymaker chooses ( B t1 , R t1 ) ≠ ( B tc , R tc ) .
ii.a) Consider first the case in which V s ( B t1 , R t1 , r t ) > V s ( B s , R s , r s ) . Then the soft

policymaker will deviate to the policy ( B t1 , R t1 ) .
ii.b) Consider now the case in which V s ( B t1 , R t1 , r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) .

Suppose now that the tough policymaker deviates to ( B tc , R tc ) . We can rule out that the
defection was caused by the soft policymaker since ( B tc , R tc ) satisfies
V s ( B tc , R tc , r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) by construction. But, we cannot rule out that the defection was

caused by the tough type, since V t ( B t1 , R t1 , r t ) < V t ( B tc , R tc , r t ) . To see this, notice that
( B tc , R tc ) maximizes the tough policymaker’s welfare when it faces the interest rate r t among
the choices ( B, R ) satisfying V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) , a condition which we are now
assuming ( B t1 , R t1 ) satisfies. Thus, according to the intuitive criterion, we should set to one the
probability that the defector is the tough policymaker, which implies that the interest rate r t will
be charged and the defection will indeed take place.
iii) Let us finally see that the least costly separating equilibrium, in which the soft

policymaker chooses ( B s , R s ) and the tough policymaker chooses ( B tc , R tc ) , does survive the
Cho-Kreps refinement.
iii.a) Any deviation ( B, R ) satisfying V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) will not increase the

welfare of any type of policymaker, no matter what the markets believe about the defector. This
is clear in the case of the soft policymaker. To see that it does not increase the welfare of the

24
tough type, simply notice that ( B tc , R tc ) maximizes the tough policymaker’s welfare when the
lowest interest rate is charge among the choices satisfying precisely the
condition V s ( B, R, r t ) ≤ V s ( B s , R s , r s ) .
iii.b) Consider now a deviation ( B, R ) satisfying V s ( B, R, r t ) > V s ( B s , R s , r s ) . Since there

exists a posterior probability that makes the soft type gain by deviating to ( B, R ) , the intuitive
criterion allows us to set at one the probability that the defector is the soft type. This guarantees
that the tough type will not deviate, since, when charged an interest rate r s , we have seen above
that it can do no better than when choosing ( B tc , R tc ) and being charged the interest rate r t .

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our study implies that political uncertainty is a key variable impacting the association
between output shocks and the patterns of debt and international reserves. Our approach can be
extended to allow for output trends, where output shocks would have the interpretation of shocks
to the growth rate of the economy. In these circumstances, disappointing economic growth may
trigger the regime switch to the separating equilibrium. Our modeling strategy focused on
explaining circumstances where the tough regime would distort its policies in order to separate
itself from the soft, populist regime. Our model does not attempt to explain how tough and soft
regimes come into office nor why their preferences may differ. Better understanding why
populism arises in Latin America and other regions remains a challenge.6

Interestingly, shortly after the IMF debt repayment by Brazil described by the lead citation,
Argentina following with its own version. While the Brazilian policy led to improvement in
Brazil’s credit rating, the opposite applies to Argentina. The Economist put it concisely, eluding
to the replacement of the IMF by Chávez as the largest Argentina’s creditor. The Economist,
Dec 20th 2005, put it succinctly:
“ The immediate effect (of Brazil debt repayment) was to rush Néstor Kirchner, Argentina's president,
into an identical declaration just two days later. He said his government would repay $9.8 billion to the
Fund, before the end of this month. In both cases, the motivations were similar. More telling was the
difference in market reaction and policy implications… Brazil's repayment exploits the robust balance of
its international payments: reserves stand at some $67 billion. …Argentina's recent experience with the
IMF has been far less happy… But the benefits to Argentina from its declaration of financial
independence are hardly clear-cut. The government was paying an interest rate of 4.2% on its loans from
the Fund. It will repay the central bank partly by issuing new debt, which is likely to pay a coupon rate of
around 9%... Thanks to the strength of its recovery, Argentina can just about afford to repay the Fund.
Since 2002, exports have increased by around 50% and the central bank's reserves almost tripled, to $27
billion. Even so, markets reacted unfavorably, with both the peso and bond prices falling. That reaction
probably had less to do with concerns about lower currency reserves than with the uncertainties Mr
Kirchner has now introduced into Argentine economic policy by casting off Mr Lavagna and the IMF in
short order… In place of the IMF, one of Argentina's largest creditors is now Hugo Chávez, Venezuela's
socialist president.”
