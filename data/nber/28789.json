    "abstract": "\n\nAfrican-American motorists may adjust their driving in response to increased scrutiny by police. In daylight, when their race is more easily observable, minority motorists are the only group less likely to have fatal motor vehicle accidents. In Massachusetts and Tennessee, we find that African-Americans are the only group of stopped motorists with slower speeds in daylight. Consistent with an illustrative model, these speed shifts are concentrated at higher percentiles of the distribution. Calibration of this model indicates this behavior creates substantial bias in conventional tests of discrimination that rely on changes in the odds a stopped motorist is a minority.\n\n",

We are also grateful for the help of Bill Dedman who provided us with the Massachusetts traffic stop data from his 2003 Boston Globe article with Francie Latour and Sharad Goel and the Stanford Open Policing Project for providing the Tennessee Highway Patrol stop data, as well as Ken Barone and James Fazzalaro for their invaluable perspective on policing. All remaining errors are our own. This research has not been directly funded by any outside agency. However, J. Kalinowski and M. Ross acknowledge prior support from the State of Connecticut and the State of Rhode Island to analyze and conduct research on racial bias in traffic stops. All data used in this study is administrative in nature and publicly available, and so not subject to IRB review.
