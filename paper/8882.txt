The Non-Optimality of Proposed Monetary Policy Rules Under
Timeless-Perspective Commitment

ABSTRACT
Several recent papers have usefully emphasized the inefficiency that arises from discretionary
monetary policymaking, relative to optimal policy from a “timeless perspective,” in macroeconomic
models with forward-looking private behavior. The inefficiency in question is in terms of average
outcomes of the conditional expectation of a policy objective that reflects the discounted present value
of current and future period losses (which involve squared deviations of inflation and output from
specified target levels). In the literature, most of the analysis has been conducted in an optimizing model
that features a Calvo-Rotemberg price adjustment equation that includes a “cost-push” shock term. This
literature suggests that policy, which keeps inflation equal to a negative multiple of the change in the
output gap, is optimal with respect to the criterion mentioned above—the unconditional expectation of
the policymaker’s objective function. Results reported here show, however, that this is not the case—that
an alternative policy rule, suggested by the approach of “policy design” rather than by “optimal control,”
delivers superior results.

Several recent papers, some quite prominent,1 have usefully emphasized the
inefficiency that arises from discretionary monetary policymaking, relative to optimal policy
from a “timeless perspective,” in macroeconomic models with forward-looking private
behavior. The inefficiency in question is in terms of average outcomes of the conditional
expectation of a policy objective that reflects the discounted present value of current and
future period losses (which involve squared deviations of inflation and output from specified
target levels). “Forward-looking” in the statement above means that expectations of future
variables (e.g., inflation) appear in structural relations representing private behavior. In the
literature in question, most of the analysis has been conducted in an optimizing model that
includes a price adjustment equation of the Calvo-Rotemberg type, often referred to as a New
Keynesian Phillips Curve, that includes a “cost-push” shock term.
Policy from a timeless perspective reflects a type of commitment, on the part of the
optimizing monetary policymaker, that avoids influences from the conditions that happen to
prevail at the date at which the posited type of policy behavior begins. It is therefore arguably
more credible than policy behavior that has the central bank planning to behave differently in
the policy’s initial period than in those to follow (as with ordinary commitment choices). It
has the feature of being time-consistent from its own perspective, although not from the
viewpoint of Kydland and Prescott (1977).2 The literature seems to suggest that policy
satisfying stated conditions—exemplified by (5) below—is optimal with respect to the
criterion mentioned above, the unconditional expectation of the policymaker’s objective
function. It has recently been shown by Jensen (2001a), however, that this is not the case—

that an alternative policy rule, suggested by the approach of “policy design” rather than by
“optimal control,” delivers superior results.3 The magnitude of improvement is not large, for
realistic parameter values, but is distinctly non-zero. The purpose of the present note is to
provide a compact description and demonstration of this particular result of Jensen’s (2001a).
Following Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (CGG, 1999), H. Jensen (1999), Woodford
(1999a, 1999b), and others, suppose that price adjustment behavior is given by
(1)

πt = βEtπt+1 + αyt + ut,

α > 0, 0 < β < 1,

where πt is inflation, yt is the output gap, and ut is a stochastic shock term that is assumed to
be autoregressive of order one with AR parameter ρ and innovation variance σ2. By the
output gap we mean the fractional difference between realized output and the flexible-price
or natural-rate level of output.
The policymaker’s objective at an arbitrary time t = 1 is to minimize

(2)

∑

βt-1 (πt2 + ω yt2),

t =1

where ω ≥ 0 reflects the relative importance of output-gap variability in policymaker
preferences.4 The macroeconomic model that we have in mind also includes an optimizing
IS-type relationship of the form
(3)

yt = Etyt+1 + b(Rt − Etπt+1) + vt,

b < 0,

where Rt is the central bank’s interest rate instrument and vt is a shock that pertains to
preferences, government spending, and the exogenous natural-rate value of output. But we
shall suppose, as in much of the literature under discussion, that the central bank (CB) can

See Woodford (1999b, pp. 293-4) for further details on the timeless perspective.
Policy design is the term used by Prescott (1977) for a procedure that involves search for optimal policy-rule
parameters after solving the model with a policy rule that includes all relevant state variables. The procedure
has been used by Taylor (1979), Rotemberg and Woodford (1999), and others.

directly control πt as an instrument—an assumption that is innocuous for the purposes of this
note (though not for all issues). Then relation (3) becomes irrelevant, and the policy problem
is to minimize (2) subject to the constraint in (1) for the current and all future periods.
The optimality conditions proposed by CGG (1999, p. 1703) and Woodford (1999a,
p. 24; 1999b, pp. 305-6), followed by McCallum and Nelson (2000), may be written as
follows:5
(4a)

2 ω yt + α λ t = 0

t = 1, 2, …

(4b)

2 πt − λt + λt-1 = 0

t = 2, 3, …

(4c)

2 πt − λt = 0

t = 1.

Here it is arbitrarily assumed that the policy is being initiated (started up) in period t = 1. But
to adopt the timeless perspective, the CB ignores (4c) and applies (4b) in period 1 as well as
in 2, 3, …. Substituting out the Lagrangian multiplier yields
(5)

πt = −(ω/α)(yt − yt-1).

Thus the behavior of πt and yt is governed, under the proposed timeless perspective
commitment policy, by relations (1) and (5) for periods t = 1, 2, ….
The minimum-state-variable (MSV) solution6 for this system is of the form
(6)

πt = φ11yt-1 + φ12 ut

(7)

yt = φ21yt-1 + φ22 ut,

and the coefficients can straightforwardly be found to equal φ11 = (ω/α)(1−δ), φ12 = (γ−βδ)-1,
φ21 = δ, and φ22 = −(α/ω)(γ−βδ)-1, where δ = [γ−(γ2 − 4β)0.5]/2β with γ = 1 + β + (α2/ω).7

For notational simplicity, we assume zero to be the target values of inflation and the output gap.
Here λt denotes the Lagrangian multiplier attached to constraint (1) for period t.

This solution agrees with those of CGG (1999) and Woodford (1999b, pp. 295, 307), and is
dynamically stable (so Eπt = 0 and Eyt =0).
To summarize policy performance, CGG (1999), Woodford (1999a, 1999b), and
McCallum and Nelson (2000) report average values of the loss function (2), i.e., values of the
unconditional expectation of (2). Because of the law of iterated expectations, that expression
equals (2) with E replacing E1. Then taking E inside the summation operator, we find that
the result equals (1 − β)-1 times the unconditional expectation of the single-period loss,
E(πt2 + ω yt2). That equality is used here only for evaluation purposes, however; it is not
utilized in the derivation (which is not discussed here) of the proposed conditions (4). In the
cited papers, the values of the average loss criterion just described is reported for outcomes
with policy rule (5) and compared with values resulting when (5) is replaced with the optimal
discretionary policy condition, which is
(8)

πt = −(ω/α) yt ,

as shown by CGG (1999), Woodford (1999a, 1999b), or McCallum and Nelson (2000). In
all of their reported cases, the average loss with (5), henceforth denoted L(5), is smaller than
that obtained with rule (8).
What Jensen (2001a) demonstrates, however, is that (5) does not yield the smallest
average loss, even if attention is restricted to rules (i.e., conditions for πt) including the same
variables as (5). Specifically, if policy is conducted according to
(9)

πt = −(ω/α)(yt − β yt-1),

then average values of (2) are smaller.8 Table 1 below reports some representative results for
L(5) and (analogously-defined) L(9) for various values of the parameters ω, β, and ρ, given
8

Since writing this note, we have learned that a very recent paper by Blake (2001) also reports this result.

α = 0.02 and E(ut2) = (1−ρ2)-1σ2 = (0.005)2.9 Since our calibration implicitly assumes
quarter-year time periods, and outcomes are reported in fractional units, the value of 0.0625
for ω represents equal weights on πt2 and yt2 in the objective function. It is clear from the
numbers in Table 1 that policy rule (9) provides smaller losses than does (5) over a wide
range of parameter magnitudes. The difference is greater when β is smaller, of course, and
when ρ is large.
A few words are needed concerning optimization conditional upon initial conditions.
It is widely recognized that condition (5) fails to minimize (2), given y0 and u1, if applied in t
= 1 as well as t = 2, 3, ….10 Jensen (2001a) points out that, in addition, (5) is not generally
optimal within the class of rules—conditions applied in all periods 1, 2, …—of the same
form. With specified values of y0 and u1, for example, one can find a rule including the same
variables as (5) that yields a lower value of (2) than does (5), with optimal coefficient values
that depend on the initial conditions. As an example, suppose that y0 = 0.03 and u1 = −0.01
with ω = 0.0625, ρ = 0.5 and β = 0.99. Then (5) yields a loss value for (2) of 0.008878
whereas the use of
(10)

πt = -2.617 yt +2.502 yt-1

results in a loss of 0.008658. 11 This example illustrates that (5) does not minimize (2) when
the same condition must be used in all periods, at least not in general. 12 13

This last magnitude is of no importance; changing it would scale all the values in Table 1 up or down
proportionately.
10
See, among others, Woodford (1999b), Svensson and Woodford (1999), King and Wolman (1999), and
Dennis (2001).
11
Calculation of these values is discussed by Jensen (2001b). All reported results use the MSV solution.
12
Condition (5) is optimal in this case if y0 = 0, but not otherwise.
13
No table is provided since it would require extensive computation and a single example suffices to make the
point at issue.

Overall, our point is not that there is anything conceptually wrong with the timeless
perspective type of policy making, in which the initial period policy reaction function is
constrained to be the same as in all succeeding periods, but that (5) is not the optimal
condition from this perspective, even if conditions (4) minimize (2). Jensen (2001a) argues
that the fashion in which optimality conditions (4) of the unconstrained problem are modified
to produce (5) does not give the optimality conditions for the constrained problem. Here our
objective is not to put forth any explanation, however, but merely to demonstrate the
superiority of rule (9) over the previously-utilized (5) from the perspective of the average
value of the loss function (2). We also point out the non-optimality of (5) with respect to
objective (2) on a conditional basis, when credible commitment requires that the same policy
rule be used in all periods including the one in which the policy regime is introduced.
