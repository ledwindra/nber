Lighting Up and Slimming Down: The Effects of Body Weight and Cigarette Prices on
Adolescent Smoking Initiation
John Cawley, Sara Markowitz, and John Tauras
NBER Working Paper No. 9561
March 2003
JEL No. I0
ABSTRACT
This paper examines the influence of body weight, body image, and cigarette prices in determining
adolescent smoking initiation. Adolescents who desire to lose weight may initiate smoking as a
method of appetite control. Such behavior may undermine the goals of tobacco control policies that
seek to prevent smoking initiation. Using a nationally representative panel of adolescents, we show
that smoking initiation is more likely among females who are overweight, who report trying to lose
weight, or who describe themselves as overweight. In contrast, neither objective nor subjective
measures of weight predict smoking initiation by males. Higher cigarette prices decrease the
probability of smoking initiation among males but have no impact on female smoking initiation.
These gender-specific differences may help explain the mixed and inconclusive evidence of the
impact of price on smoking initiation found in previous literature.

INTRODUCTION
Smoking and obesity are the two leading causes of preventable deaths in the United

States. It is estimated that over 400,000 deaths per year are attributable to smoking (CDC 1993),
and 280,000 to 350,000 deaths per year are attributable to obesity (Allison et al. 1999). In
December 2001, Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher warned that obesity may soon overtake
tobacco as the chief cause of preventable death (Associated Press 2001).
Body weight and smoking status are closely interrelated. There is a broad literature
showing that adult smokers weigh less than non-smokers (Nemery et al. 1983; Fehily et al. 1984;
USDHHS 1988; Klesges et al. 1989). Furthermore, research on the effect of smoking cessation
on weight consistently shows that smoking cessation by adults results in an average weight gain
of 2-3 kilograms (Gordon et al. 1975; USDHHS 1990; Klesges et al. 1989; Pinkowish 1999).
The vast majority of smokers begin smoking during adolescence (USDHHS 1994). This
may also be the stage of life when people, especially girls, are most sensitive to their body
weight. The perception that smoking controls weight is common among youths, especially
among teenage girls (Camp et al. 1993, Brooks 1998). As a result, teenagers who want to lose
weight may begin to smoke based on the belief that smoking will facilitate weight loss.
From a policy perspective, it is important to know the role of body weight and body
image in determining smoking initiation. Previous research has shown that tobacco control
policies, such as higher taxes on cigarettes, can deter smoking. However, as the prevalence of
obesity increases among children and the dangers associated with being overweight become
well-known, smoking rates may rise if personal goals of weight loss overshadow the deterrent
effects of anti-smoking public policies.
This paper examines the dual roles of body weight and tobacco control policies in

1

predicting smoking initiation by adolescents. In particular, the impact of perceived body weight,
actual body weight, cigarette prices, and socioeconomic factors on smoking initiation are
examined for males and females. The results indicate that females who report trying to lose
weight and those who describe themselves as overweight are more likely to initiate smoking. In
contrast, neither objective nor subjective measures of weight predict smoking initiation for
males. Higher cigarette prices deter smoking initiation by males, but have no impact on smoking
by females.

II.

RELEVANT LITERATURE
A few previous studies have examined the effects of a demonstrated concern about

weight on smoking status in youths. Tomeo et al. (1999), Wiseman et al. (1998), and French et
al. (1994) find that concern about weight is correlated with current smoking or smoking initiation
for female adolescents. Voorhees et al. (2002) show that girls are more likely to be daily
smokers at ages 18-19 if they tried to lose weight when younger or are currently trying to lose
weight. Tucker (1983) is the only study to look at effect of actually being overweight (as
opposed to perceptions of overweight or desire to lose weight) as a predictor of smoking
initiation and finds that obese boys have stronger intentions of smoking than lighter boys. Girls
are not examined.
Most of the existing studies on smoking and weight suffer from the fact that their samples
are drawn from restrictive geographic areas or use samples otherwise not representative of the
population of American teenagers. Moreover, French et al. (1994) is the only study to examining
the probability of transition from non-smoker to smoker in a panel of respondents. Our study
adds to this literature by examining the transition from non-smoker to smoker in a large,

2

nationally representative sample of youth, and by focusing on both weight concerns and actual
body weight.
Another drawback to the existing research is that these studies all fail to include tobacco
control policies, such as cigarette prices or taxes, which are potentially important predictors of
smoking initiation. The omission of these economic variables will not bias the coefficient on
weight concerns unless the two are correlated; however, we believe that controlling for both is
important because it yields information on the relative importance of the two factors in the
smoking initiation decision.
Economic studies of smoking behaviors have focused on the impact of price and other
regulatory variables, while ignoring the role of body weight. To date, only five econometric
studies have attempted to examine the impact of cigarette prices or taxes on smoking initiation,
the results of which vary considerably. In the earliest studies, Douglas and Hariharan (1994) and
Douglas (1998) find that cigarette prices are uncorrelated with the decision to initiate smoking.
However, the results of these first studies should be interpreted with caution given that duration
analysis is applied to cross sectional data and retrospective information on smoking initiation.
Incorrect recall by participants on smoking initiation, along with errors from matching price with
past residence will influence the results. As Douglas (1998) notes, the panel data requirements
needed to use duration modeling are not met. In another study using retrospective data, Forster
and Jones (1999) find that higher taxes will prolong the amount of time before an eventual
smoker actually begins, although the magnitude of the impact is small.
The results from initiation studies that use longitudinal data are mixed. Tauras et al.
(2001) conclude that cigarette prices are strongly negatively correlated with the probability of
transition to daily smoking. However, the effect of price on the probability of transition to

3

smoking any quantity of cigarettes is not statistically significant. DeCicca et al. (2002) find
cigarette taxes and youth smoking initiation to be inversely related in some model specifications.
However, when they control for state fixed effects, the effect of cigarette excise taxes is not
statistically significant. None of these studies analyze the smoking decision separately by
gender. As we will show, there are large and important differences in the determinants of
smoking initiation for males and females. Weight concerns influence the initiation decisions of
females while the price of cigarettes plays a much stronger role for males.

III.

METHODS

Analytical Framework
This section develops a model of smoking initiation using standard economic models
developed by Becker (1965) and Grossman (1972). The utility function for adolescents is a
function of smoking (S), health (H), and other goods (X), all of which are subject to tastes (u):
1) U=f(S, H(S, W(E, S, G)), X; u).
A production function for health is embedded in equation 1, in which smoking and excessive
weight are each negative inputs into the production of good health. Weight also has a production
function and can be lowered by dieting or exercise (E) and smoking. Weight is also partly
determined by genetics (G).
The budget constraint faced by adolescents is represented by equation 2 where total
earned and unearned income (I), is equated to the sum of EPe, expenditures on weight loss (e.g.
dieting and exercise); expenditures on smoking (SPs); and expenditures on all other goods
(XPx):
2) I=EPe + SPs + XPx.

4

Maximizing utility subject to the budget constraint yields the following first order condition for
smoking:
3) US + UH HW WS = λPs - UH HS,
where subscripts denote marginal effects. This first order condition shows that the benefits of
smoking, which include the direct effect of smoking on utility (US) plus the health benefits of
losing weight (UH HW WS), equals the utility forgone because money was spent on smoking
(λPs) and the utility loss from the health consequences of smoking (UH HS). In any time period,
if the benefits to smoking outweigh the costs, the individual will initiate or continue smoking. If
the costs outweigh the benefits, the individual will abstain from smoking.
The first order condition for smoking implies the following quasi-structural equation that
will serve as the basis for empirical estimation:
4) S=f(Ps, W, I, u),
where S=1 if the respondent is a current smoker and S=0 otherwise. Smoking status is
determined by the full price of smoking, body weight, income, and tastes. The quasi-structural
equation is estimated instead of a reduced form demand equation since we are interested in the
impact that weight concerns have on the decision to smoke. The model predicts that an increase
in the price of cigarettes will decrease the probability of being a smoker, but an increase in the
weight loss effects of smoking (WS) will increase the probability of smoking. This latter effect
might be offset by the negative effects of smoking on health (HS).
This framework and the empirical estimation thereof can be used to help measure the
effectiveness of tobacco control policies. For example, assume that every teen has the same
belief about the detrimental health effects of smoking (UHHS is the same for everyone), and that
smoking provides the same utility (US) for everyone. Further assume that smoking causes the

5

same amount of weight loss for every individual (WS is the same for everyone). Each individual
will then compare the price of smoking (λPs) to the utility benefits of weight loss (UH HW). For
individuals who place a low value on weight loss, changes in the price of cigarettes will more
heavily influence smoking status because the benefits of smoking will be less. For people who
place a high value on weight loss, price changes may have less impact. Existing literature
provides some clues as to which may be more important for certain groups. For example, girls
tend to be much more sensitive to their weight and are more likely to try radical weight loss
strategies (Tomeo et al. 1999; Camp et al. 1993). This would imply that tax increases on
cigarettes may be less effective for girls than for boys.

Empirical Estimation
The empirical model is derived from the structural equation above:
5) ST = α1PsT + α2WT-1 + α3IT + α4uT.
In each period, if the benefits derived from smoking outweigh the costs, the adolescent will
smoke (either initiate or continue). The determinants of that decision include the full price of
smoking (Ps), weight (W), income (I), and other observed and unobserved social and
interpersonal factors that enter the decision to smoke (u). Equation 5 is estimated separately by
gender. The measures of weight are lagged to the previous time period to ensure that weight is
measured before the anorectic effects of smoking begin. Additional potential sources of
endogeneity of the weight measures are discussed further below.
Equation 5 is estimated using a discrete time duration method, which is an appropriate
statistical technique for examining the structural determinants of the decision to make a
transition from one state to another. The discrete time methodology uses a probit specification to

6

estimate the hazard rate (Allison, 1984). In the current period, individuals who are not at risk of
making a transition (current smokers) are removed from the sample, and a binary dependent
variable is created which equals one if a transition is made from non-smoker to smoker in the
subsequent wave. Smokers who quit and then relapse are not included in the analysis since these
respondents are removed from the sample after the first transition.

IV.

DATA
The data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (NLSY97).

The NLSY97 is a nationally representative sample of 9,022 youths aged 12-16 as of Dec. 31
1996. The first wave was conducted in 1997, with follow-ups currently available for 1998, 1999
and 2000. Thus, the age range of this panel (ages 12-21) covers the ages at which the vast
majority of eventual smokers initiate.
Two measures of smoking initiation are constructed. The first represents the transition
from non-smoker to smoking any positive quantity of cigarettes; this is termed “less stringent
initiation”. The second, “more stringent initiation”, reflects the transition from non-smoker to a
frequent smoker, as measured by having smoked at least 15 days in the past 30. Light smokers
(those smoking less than 15 days but more than zero) are omitted from this measure. These
transitions are examined three times—between 1997 and 1998, between 1998 and 1999, and
between 1999 and 2000. For example, in 1998, a respondent is considered an initiator if in 1997
the respondent had never smoked a cigarette but a positive quantity was reported in 1998. This
process results in up to three observations for each individual. Respondents reporting smoking
in 1997 are omitted from the estimation sample.
Table 1 shows that 10.3 percent of the males and 8.5 percent of females initiate smoking

7

of any level at some point during the sample period. About 4 percent of males and 2.5 percent of
females initiate heavy smoking during the sample period.
The questions regarding weight that were asked of NLSY97 respondents include
objective and subjective measures: weight in pounds and height in inches, the respondent’s
description of his or her weight, and a question asking what the respondent is currently doing
about his or her weight. These questions are asked in every interview, thus, the weight variables
are known prior to smoking initiation for most respondents.
Weight and height are used to calculate a body mass index (BMI), which is then
classified into weight categories as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Children are
classified as normal weight if their BMI lies between historic 5th and 85th percentiles as
calculated by the CDC. Children are classified as at risk of being overweight if their BMI is
greater than the 85th percentile and are considered overweight if their BMI is greater than the 95th
percentile; to reiterate, these percentiles are as defined by the CDC using historic data and are
not the percentiles of the NLSY 1997 sample. The values of BMI in each percentile vary by
gender and age. For example, a 16-year-old girl with a BMI greater than 28.8 is considered
overweight, while a boy of the same age is considered overweight when the BMI exceeds 27.5.
Seventeen-year-olds must have a BMI greater than 29.6 and 28.2, for girls and boys respectively,
to be considered overweight.
One objective measure and two subjective measures of weight are used in the analysis.
The objective measure is a dichotomous indicator that equals one if the respondent’s BMI
exceeds the 85th percentile, which includes respondents who are overweight or at risk of being
overweight. Table 1 shows that 32 percent of males and approximately 25 percent of females fall
into this category. The first subjective measure is a dichotomous indicator for whether or not the

8

respondent is trying to lose weight. Twenty-five percent of males and 45 percent of females
report trying to lose weight in this sample. The second subjective measure is a pair of indicator
variables created from a question of how the respondent describes his or her weight.
Respondents’ self-perceived weight is categorized as overweight if they describe themselves as
very overweight or overweight (21 percent of males and 32 percent of females). Those
describing themselves as very underweight or slightly underweight are categorized as
underweight (18 percent of males and 12 percent of females). The omitted reference group
consists of respondents who reported being “about the right weight”.
The characteristics of the youth and family included as regressors are: age, race, gender,
education level (enrolled in high school, high school drop-out, high school diploma or in
college), marital status (single versus married, separated, or divorced), youth income (which
includes earned income and allowances from parents), household size, family structure (child
lives with both parents, child lives with no parents, child lives with a step parent or one parent),
an indicator that equals one if the child does not identify with a religion, and work status. Table
1 shows means and standard deviations for these variables.
The price of cigarettes is included in all models and comes from the Tobacco Institute’s
annual Tax Burden on Tobacco. The state price is a weighted average of a pack of 20 cigarettes
based on the prices of single packs, cartons, and vending machine sales where the weights are the
national proportions of each type of sale. These prices are inclusive of state level sales taxes
applied to cigarettes. Cigarette prices are merged in based on the state of residence or the
location of the respondent’s college, when applicable.
To partially control for unobserved state sentiment towards smoking that may affect
cigarette prices and smoking initiation, all models include a dichotomous indicator for whether

9

or not the respondent resided in a tobacco producing state when the surveys were conducted.
This indicator takes on a value of 1 if the individual resides in Kentucky, North Carolina,
Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, or Virginia, and zero otherwise.

V.

ESTIMATION AND RESULTS
Estimates from the duration analysis are presented in Tables 2-4. Table 2 contains results

for models that include the indicator for BMI greater than the 85th percentile. Table 3 contains
results for models that include an indicator for attempting to lose weight. Table 4 contains
results for models that include indicator variables for self-perceived overweight and
underweight.
The first three models of Tables 2-4 employ the less stringent measure of initiation,
which represents the transition from nonsmoking to smoking any positive quantity of cigarettes.
Model 1 contains estimates for both genders combined. Models 2 and 3 contain estimates for
males and females, respectively. Models 4, 5, and 6 of Tables 2-4 are identical to models 1, 2,
and 3, except that they employ the more stringent initiation measure (transition from nonsmoking
to smoking on at least 15 of the past 30 days).
Given the panel nature of the data, the standard errors of the estimates are cluster
corrected at the individual level using a robust method of calculating the variance covariance
matrix developed by Huber (1967). The cluster correction relaxes the assumption of
independence of observations so that observations only have to be independent across
individuals but not among observations of the same individual.

10

Unobserved Smoking Sentiment
It is possible that unobserved state sentiment toward smoking may affect both youth
smoking initiation and cigarette prices (through the enactment of cigarette excise taxes). To
control for this possibility several strategies were pursued. First, state fixed effects were
included in the models. Unfortunately, the inclusion of state fixed effects in conjunction with the
time fixed effects eliminated virtually all the independent variation in cigarette prices. An
ordinary least squares regression of cigarette prices regressed on state and time effects alone
yielded a coefficient of determination of 0.99. These results implied that there is not enough
variation in cigarette prices within states to include state fixed effects in the model.
Second, the smoking initiation equations were estimated on a subsample of the
respondents who did not reside in tobacco producing states during the time that the survey was
being conducted. That is, individuals who resided in Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, South
Carolina, Tennessee, or Virginia when the surveys were conducted were eliminated from the
regressions. The results from this specification are very similar to those presented in the paper.
No significant differences with respect to cigarette prices or body weight are observed. Results
are available upon request.
Finally, the models presented in this paper are conducted on the full sample of
respondents and include a dichotomous indicator for whether or not the respondent resided in
one of the tobacco producing states. In general, the results suggest that, all else equal,
individuals who reside in tobacco producing states are more likely to initiate smoking; these
coefficients, however, fail to reach the 5 percent significance levels in all models.

11

Results for Price of Cigarettes
The real price of cigarettes has a negative and statistically significant impact on smoking
initiation among males in all the models that were estimated for both measures of smoking
initiation. However, cigarette prices are found to be insignificant determinants of female
smoking initiation. Given this, this section will focus on the impact of price on smoking
initiation decisions of males.
Since the probit model is nonlinear in nature, the estimated parameters do not directly
provide meaningful information for understanding the exact relationship between cigarette prices
and smoking initiation. Predicted probabilities and elasticities provide a more substantively
meaningful method of interpreting the results. Table 5 provides the predicted probabilities of
male smoking initiation when cigarette price is set at its minimum, maximum, and mean values
holding all other independent variables at their mean. Table 5 also provides the estimated price
elasticities of smoking initiation holding all independent variables, including price, at their mean.
The models estimated in Table 2 imply that varying the real price of cigarettes (base
years of price deflation = 1982-1984) from its minimum of $1.12 per pack to its maximum of
$2.57 per pack decreases the predicted probability of less stringent male smoking initiation from
0.126 to 0.067, a decrease of 5.9 percentage points. Similarly, the models estimated in Table 2
imply that varying the real price of cigarettes from its minimum to its maximum value decreases
the predicted probability of more stringent male smoking initiation from 0.055 to 0.016, a
decrease of 3.9 percentage points. The predicted probabilities of male smoking initiation derived
from the models estimated in Tables 3 and 4 are virtually identical to those estimated in Table 2.
The average price elasticities of less stringent smoking initiation and more stringent
smoking initiation across all models estimated on males in Tables 2-4 are -0.93 and -1.59,

12

respectively. These results indicate that a 10% increase in cigarette prices will decrease less
stringent smoking initiation by approximately 9.3% and decrease more stringent smoking
initiation by 15.9%. These finding clearly indicate that increases in cigarette prices will prevent
many young males from initiating cigarette smoking.

Results for Overweight
We find that both objective and subjective measures of weight have important impacts on
the smoking initiation decisions of female adolescents. However, we find no significant impact
of any weight measure on smoking initiation by males. Therefore, this section focuses solely on
the impact of body weight on the smoking initiation decisions of females.
Table 2 shows that females whose BMI the previous year was greater than the 85th
percentile were significantly more likely to initiate smoking. In addition, Table 3 shows that
females who are attempting to lose weight are also significantly more likely to initiate smoking.
Table 4 shows that females who perceive themselves as being overweight are more likely to
initiate smoking than are females who perceive themselves as being of normal weight. However,
the perception of being overweight is not significant at conventional levels when the more
stringent measure of initiation is employed.
Table 6 provides the predicted probabilities of female smoking initiation holding all other
independent variables at their mean values. Since all the weight measures are discrete, the
minimum predicted probability corresponds to the predicted probability that the dichotomous
indicator takes on a value of zero, whereas, the maximum predicted probability corresponds to
the dichotomous indicator taking on a value of one.

13

The models estimated in Table 2 imply that females who have a BMI at or above the 85th
percentile have a 0.016 greater probability of less stringent smoking initiation and a 0.007 greater
probability of more stringent smoking initiation. While small in magnitude, these numbers
represent large percent increases in the probability of smoking initiation; specifically, a 21.1
percent increase in the probability of less stringent initiation, and a 43.8 percent increase in
probability of more stringent initiation.
With respect to the subjective measures of body weight, females who are trying to lose
weight have a 0.025 (36.2 percent) greater probability of less stringent smoking initiation and a
0.007 (50 percent) greater probability of more stringent smoking initiation. Finally, females who
perceive themselves as overweight have a 0.024 (33.3 percent) greater probability of less
stringent smoking initiation and a 0.005 (33.3 percent) greater probability of more stringent
smoking initiation.

VI.

ENDOGENEITY
In the empirical estimation of equation 5, it is important to consider two potential sources

of endogeneity that may bias our results. First, there may exist a positive association between
weight concerns and smoking for reasons other than weight loss. This might occur if there exist
unobserved factors that affect both weight and smoking. For example, adolescents suffering
from depression may both overeat and smoke to lift their spirits. Adolescents who place little
value on the future may assign little importance to the future health consequences of both
smoking and obesity. Second, reverse causality may bias the results; that is, in addition to body
weight affecting smoking decisions, smoking decisions may affect body weight. This second
source of endogeneity is likely to be small or non-existent due to the use of lagged measures of

14

weight on the right-hand side of equation 5, which is estimated only for those who were nonsmokers at the time weight was recorded.
Two methods are used to test and potentially correct for the possible endogeneity of body
weight and weight perceptions due to unobserved third factors. The first is the method of
instrumental variables (IV), which identifies the causal effect using variables that are strongly
correlated with objective weight and uncorrelated with the error term in the smoking equation.
IV is used when the measure of weight is objective. In the first stage of IV estimation, the
indicator for female BMI ≥ 85th percentile is predicted using an indicator of obesity for the
respondent’s biological mother (defined as BMI greater than or equal to 30) observed at one
point in time. Our identifying assumption has two parts. The first is that mother’s obesity status
is highly correlated with the respondent’s obesity status through genetics. This is supported by
research in behavioral genetics, which finds that genes explain roughly half of the variance in
weight across people (Allison et al., 1996), and that children are expected to share half of their
genes with their biological mothers. Due to shared genes, there is a strong correlation between
the weights of mothers and children. Most estimates from U.S. data of the correlation between
the adult BMI of a mother, and the childhood or adolescent BMI of her child are in the range
0.21-0.36 and the correlation does not differ by the gender of the child (Maes et al. 1997). The
second part of the identifying assumption is that mother’s obesity status is uncorrelated with the
residual in the smoking equation.
Table 7 compares estimates from linear probability (LP) regressions to those of a two
stage least squares regression in which overweight status is instrumented for using mother’s
obesity status.1 The positive and highly significant t-statistic (which is greater than 15) on

1

Heckman and MaCurdy (1985) and Angrist (2001) show the validity of using linear probability models for
estimating simultaneous equations with dichotomous endogenous variables.

15

mother’s obesity status in the first stage of two-stage least squares indicates that it is a powerful
instrument for a teenager’s weight status. However, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman chi-square test
(Durbin, 1954; Wu, 1973; Hausman, 1978) indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis
that the LP coefficient is consistent and asymptotically efficient. Thus, there is little evidence to
suggest that this measure of weight is endogenous in the female smoking initiation equations.
Similarly, there is no evidence that weight is endogenous for the sample of males, however, both
the LP and two stage estimates are not statistically significant (results are not shown, but are
available upon request).
The second approach to address the endogeneity issue is to control for other factors that
have the potential to affect both smoking and weight. This approach is most useful for the
models using weight perceptions, for which no valid instruments are available. We add to the set
of regressors a measure of depression and a measure of behavioral problems, both of which were
elicited in the first wave of the NLSY97 from a subsample of respondents who were born in
1982, 1983, and 1984. The responses to these two questions were assigned to all waves of each
individual’s data. Regarding depression, these youth were asked how well the statement, “you
are unhappy, sad, or depressed” described them over the past six months. Possible answers are:
not true, somewhat or sometimes true, or often true. A behavioral and emotional problems scale
was also calculated for each of these respondents based on a series of questions regarding
attitudes about self; higher scores indicate more behavior problems. The drawbacks to the
inclusion of these questions are: first, we are forced to limit our sample to the subset of NLSY97
respondents who were asked these questions; and second, these measures were only taken at a
single point in time and therefore cannot measure the effect of changes in attitudes or behaviors
over time.

16

Table 8 compares estimates from models for females that include measures of depression
or behavioral problems to models that exclude these determinants that were estimated using the
same sample. The estimates from Table 8 suggest that females who suffer from depression and
exhibit behavioral problems are more likely to start smoking than are individuals who are not
afflicted with these problems. However, only the coefficients on behavioral problems are
significant at the 5 percent levels in all models, while the coefficients on depression are only
significant at the 10 percent level in the model using the less stringent measure of smoking
initiation. More importantly, the inclusion of these measures does not alter the finding that
weight concerns are correlated with smoking initiation. While the magnitudes of the weight
coefficients fall slightly, there are no noteworthy differences between the models that include the
measures of depression/behavioral problems and those that exclude these determinants. In the
corresponding models for the sample of males (available upon request), the subjective measures
of weight remain statistically insignificant across all models.

SUMMARY
This paper examines the influence of body weight, body image, and cigarette prices on
the smoking initiation decision of adolescents. Discrete time duration models are estimated
using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort, for two definitions of
smoking initiation: one representing the transition from non-smoker to smoking any quantity,
and the second representing the transition from non-smoker to frequent smoker.
We present a model of smoking initiation in which an individual weighs the full costs and
benefits of smoking. The costs include the detrimental effects of smoking on health and the
monetary price of purchasing cigarettes, while the benefits include any weight loss resulting

17

from smoking and the direct pleasure derived from smoking. For females who place a high
value on the benefits of weight loss, price considerations may play only a minor role in the
initiation decision. For males who tend not to value weight loss as strongly as females, the
monetary price may have greater influence on the decision to smoke.
We find that females who have a high body mass index, who report that they are trying to
lose weight, and who describe themselves as overweight are more likely to initiate smoking than
other females. Cigarette prices have an insignificant impact on female smoking initiation. In
contrast, we find that cigarette price is a strong determinant of initiation for males, while neither
actual body weight nor measures of perceived body image predict their smoking initiation.
Results from the previous literature on cigarette prices and smoking initiation have been
mixed and inconclusive. In contrast, we find consistently strong price effects for males, and
insignificant effects for females. For males, the estimated price elasticity is –0.9 for initiation
into any quantity and is –1.6 for initiation into frequent smoking. When calculated using a
pooled sample of males and females, these elasticities fall to –0.4 and –0.6, respectively, and the
estimates are often not statistically different from zero. Such elasticities calculated for a pooled
sample paint a misleading picture of the impact of price since they represent a weighted average
of the diverse gender-specific effects. As a result, caution should be exercised when drawing
conclusions from the previous literature that has not considered gender differences in the
decision to smoke.
