    "abstract": "\n\n\u2018CEOs\u2019 of public schools in many countries have authority and responsibilities that can greatly affect the quality of schooling. This paper estimates the impact of education CEOs on student outcomes in Israeli elementary schools. We estimate CEO quality in two ways\u2014once using schools that don't switch CEOs and once using schools that do. We show that switches are exogenous and are not correlated with potential outcomes. CEOs' quality positively affects students\u2019 test scores and behavioural outcomes, with pronounced effects for disadvantaged schools. Potential mechanisms show that high-quality CEOs lead to improvements in school priorities, working procedures, and violence reduction.\n\n",
