The Myth of the Drinker’s Bonus

NBER Working Paper No. 11902
December 2005
JEL No. I112, J24
ABSTRACT
Drinkers earn more than non-drinkers, even after controlling for human capital and local labor
market conditions. Several mechanisms by which drinking could increase productivity have been
proposed but are unconfirmed; the more obvious mechanisms predict the opposite, that drinking can
impair productivity. In this paper we reproduce the positive association between drinking and
earnings, using data for adults age 27-34 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979).
Since drinking is endogenous in this relationship, we then estimate a reduced-form equation, with
alcohol prices (proxied by a new index of excise taxes) replacing the drinking variables. We find
strong evidence that the prevalence of full-time work increases with alcohol prices – suggesting that
a reduction in drinking increases the labor supply. We also demonstrate some evidence of a positive
association between alcohol prices and the earnings of full-time workers. We conclude that most
likely the positive association between drinking and earnings is the result of the fact that ethanol is
a normal commodity, the consumption of which increases with income, rather than an elixer that
enhances productivity.

1. Introduction
Common sense, backed by a good deal of evidence, suggests that drinking could impair
productivity. In fact, estimates of alcohol-related social costs are typically dominated by the
value of lost productivity (Harwood, Fountain & Livermore 1998). Historically the concern with
the quality and quantity of work provided by the labor force was a major factor in Nineteenth
Century temperance movements in the United States and Europe (Roberts 1984; Rumbarger
1989). Clark Warburton (1932) stated the argument concisely:
Prohibition, if it actually resulted in the cessation of use of alcoholic beverages, might be
expected to affect the efficiency of industry in several ways. The principal effect of
alcohol is on the central nervous system, and experiments show that a decrease in the
consumption of alcohol during, or immediately preceding, working hours is accompanied
by greater skill at work. The finer co-ordination made possible by the absence of alcohol
tends to reduce the accident rate. The elimination of drinking bouts should tend to
eliminate absenteeism, especially on Monday, and irregularity in reporting at work. The
impossibility of drinking to excess should result in less sickness and absence on account
thereof, and in a longer average working life (195-196).
In recent times a majority of large corporations in the United States have established
occupational alcoholism programs or employee-assistance programs to improve productivity
(Walsh 1982).
Curiously, however, the link between drinking and reduced productivity (as measured by
earnings) does not receive unambiguous support from the econometric work on this subject. In
fact, drinkers as a group earn more than those who abstain, and that “drinker’s bonus” is not
necessarily limited to the moderate drinkers (Berger & Leigh 1988; Cook 1991; French & Zarkin
4

1995; Heien 1996; Hamilton & Hamilton 1997; Zarkin, et al. 1998; MacDonald & Shields 2001;
van Ours 2004). These findings are intriguing, and have generated speculation about possible
mechanisms. Perhaps drinking confers health benefits, or enhances “networking.” But such
speculations presume that the statistical association is the result, at least in part, of a causal
process flowing from drinking to earnings. A more obvious interpretation is just the reverse –
that earnings influence whether and how much someone drinks. Indeed, there is good evidence
that ethanol is a normal commodity, with consumption increasing with income (Ruhm 1995;
Cook & Tauchen 1982).
A number of analysts have considered the possibility of two-way causation, typically
using instrumental variables (IV) methods to remove any influence of earnings on drinking and
isolate the putative effect of drinking on earnings. Those studies, reviewed below, have had
mixed results, in part because of the questionable specifications used in some of them.
In this paper we estimate a series of earnings equations for youthful (age 21-35) workers
based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 cohort). As have other
analysts, we are able to document the existence of the drinker’s bonus in these data, both with
and without a long list of controls for personal and labor-market characteristics. We then report
the results of a reduced-form analysis using a new index of alcohol-excise taxes, demonstrating
that the prevalence of full-time work increases with the state tax level. We conclude that at least
for this population (adults prior to middle age) drinking does not improve the quality of labor
supply, and may well reduce the quantity. The drinker’s bonus is most likely an artifact resulting
from the reverse causal process; quite simply, drinking is a normal activity, the likelihood of
5

which increases with earnings.
Also of possible interest are our ancillary findings concerning individual characteristics -personality, body mass, and height – and local labor market conditions, as measured by our local
wage index.
Here is a brief roadmap of the paper. The next section reviews the literature, with special
attention to analyses that attempted to correct for the endogeneity of drinking in the earnings
equation. Section 3 then describes the data set and develops our estimation strategy. Here we
introduce a new index of local (MSA level) wages, and a new index of alcohol excise taxes.
Section 4 documents the drinker’s bonus using the NLSY data, finding that it is quite robust to
alternative specifications. The following section reports the results of reduced-form estimates.
The final section concludes.

2. Evidence that drinking affects productivity
An early effort to estimate the productivity costs of drinking is due to Yale economist
Irving Fisher (1926). His view was that drinking slowed down the "human machine" (p. 118),
and he noted that "All of us know that industrial efficiency was one of the chief reasons for
Prohibition (p. 158)." He supported his claim of impaired productivity by citing experiments
which showed that drinking reduces proficiency or speed at some task. In particular, he noted an
experiment in which four typesetters were studied over a four-day period; two of them were
given drinks, and the other two were used as a control group. The conclusion was that drinking
three glasses of beer in a day reduced typesetting output by about 10 percent. Fisher made a
6

heroic extrapolation from this result, projecting a 5 percent increase in national productivity as a
result of reduced drinking caused by Prohibition.
There have been surprisingly few modern-day experiments on how drinking affects work,
perhaps because it seems obvious. Several laboratory studies have been conducted on the effects
of hangovers on job performance in industrial settings (Mangione, et al. 1999). Subjects drank
till intoxicated, slept it off, and then the next morning performed tasks in simulated work
situations (Wolkenberg, Gold & Tichauer 1975). Even as much as 18 hours after the drinking
bout, experimenters observed residual effects of the drinking bout on reaction time, motor skills,
perception, and other performance attributes.
One of the largest observational studies, the Worksite Alcohol Project, found that
problematic drinking (but not drinking per se) was associated with work-related problems.
(Mangione, et al. 1999). Sixteen work sites belonging to seven different corporations, spanning
the gamut from professional office to factory, were included, with over 9,000 individual survey
respondents interviewed in the early 1990s. The respondents were asked about job-related
problems during the previous year, including having missed work; done poor quality work;
arrived late or left early; done less work than expected; had an argument with a co-worker; or
been hurt on the job. The combined frequency of these work performance problems was
regressed on self-reported measures of drinking and alcohol-related problems, controlling for
demographic characteristics, life circumstances and job characteristics. Three drinking measures
had a significantly positive effect: drinking on the job, sometimes drinking to get drunk, and

7

dependence on alcohol. Given these other measures the weekly quantity of alcohol consumed
had no discernible effect on problem frequency.1
Finally, several surveys have asked respondents whether their drinking has caused them
any problems (Room, Bondy & Ferris 1995). For example, in a national survey conducted in the
United States in 1984, 2.9 percent of men stated that their drinking had harmed their employment
opportunities, and 0.8 percent reported they had lost or nearly lost a job as a result of their
drinking (Hilton & Clark 1987). The corresponding percentages for women were about half
those of the men. These percentages seem remarkably small relative to the prevalence of alcohol
abuse.
The possibility that drinking is actually rewarded in the labor market was first suggested
by economists Mark Berger and Paul Leigh (1988). They compared the hourly wages of drinkers
and nondrinkers,2 finding that for males the drinkers earned 10% more, while for females the
drinkers earned 35% more. After controlling for experience, education, occupation, race and
marital status, the differences shrank somewhat but remained large.
This finding that abstainers earn less than drinkers, or at least moderate drinkers, has been
replicated using a variety of data sets for the United States (Kenkel & Ribar 1994; Heien 1996;
1

Several other studies have analyzed the effect of drinking on absenteeism. Manning et al.
(1991) report results from two data sets, the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) and the
National Health Interview Study for 1983. In neither do they find a relationship between quantity
consumed by current drinkers and absenteeism. (Using the HIE they find that "former drinkers"
have 38 percent higher absentee rates than others.) On the other hand, French and Zarkin (1995),
using survey data for workers at four large work sites, find that both overall drinking and
frequency of drunkenness are positively related to absenteeism.
2

They defined “drinker” as someone who reported drinking at least once or twice per week.
8

Zarkin, et al. 1998; French & Zarkin 1995), Canada (Hamilton & Hamilton 1997), England
(MacDonald & Shields 2001), and the Netherlands (van Ours 2004).
How should these results be interpreted? Economists equate earnings (hourly or annual)
with productivity, albeit with a number of qualifications (Bowles, Gintis & Osborne 2001;
Kenkel & Wang 1999; Mullahy 1993). Accepting that view, the question becomes “why should
workers who drink be more productive on average than those who don’t?” One answer, of
course, is that drinking itself actually enhances productivity; that some people tend to perform
better on the job if they are drinkers than abstainers. Several authors have suggested that the
beneficial mechanism may be via the health benefits of moderate drinking (Heien 1996;
Hamilton & Hamilton 1997). But since those benefits are primarily through heart-disease
prevention in middle age, the “health” mechanism does not account for the drinker’s bonus
among workers in their 20s and 30s. Another possibility is that drinking facilitates social
networking, which in turn generates improved job options; most people find their jobs through
word-of-mouth, and having a wide network of friends and acquaintances is an important aspect
of ones “social capital.”3 In an environment where drinking is a routine aspect of socializing,
drinkers may be more productive because they find better jobs on average.
But the “drinker’s bonus” may not be “real,” in the sense of reflecting the causal effect of
drinking on earnings and productivity. The usual problems in analyzing non-experimental data

Those who drank less often were lumped in with the abstainers.
This interpretation is developed by MacDonald and Shields (2001) and others. The importance
of a social network in job finding is documented by Granovetter (1975 (2nd ed., 1995)). The
economic interpretation of social capital is developed by Glaeser, Laibson, and Sacerdote (2002)
and by Durlauf and Fafchamps (2004).

arise, including omitted-variables bias. Drinkers and abstainers may differ in hard-to-measure
ways that are relevant to labor-market success, such as the ability to get along well with other
people, or personal priorities between home life and career. The literature includes heroic efforts
to deal with this omitted-variables problem, but the possibility of bias remains (Kenkel & Ribar
1994). In addition to genuine confounders are problems that may arise as artifacts of the
measurement process. For example, self-reported drinking may be affected by how trusting the
respondent is of the survey interview process. A spurious correlation between drinking and
earnings will arise if more trusting respondents are more likely to admit their drinking in the
NLSY interviews and also tend to earn more (or be willing to report a higher percentage of their
income).
Alcohol dependence and abuse. In addition to the effect of current drinking on
productivity, if any, there may also be an effect of past drinking as mediated by the acquisition of
human capital and by health status (mental and physical) (Bray 2003; Grossman 1972; Grossman
2000). Several studies have explored this linkage using data on two alcohol-related conditions
termed "alcohol dependence" and "alcohol abuse" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association. "Alcohol dependence" is defined by
symptoms indicating psychological and physical dependence on alcohol and neglect of
responsibilities at work or home. "Alcohol abuse" is defined by continued drinking despite
alcohol-related problems and risky behavior associated with bouts of heavy drinking.
John Mullahy and Jody Sindelar (1993) utilize data from the Epidemiological Catchment
Area survey of the New Haven area, which includes diagnostic questions on mental illness.
10

Twenty percent of their primary sample (males age 30-59) had at some point in their lives
experienced the symptoms defining alcohol dependence or abuse. This group of problem
drinkers had a substantially lower employment rate and lower earnings -- results that held up
after controlling for other characteristics. (Strangely, alcoholic males in their 20s and 60s
actually had higher earnings than non-alcoholics.) In another analysis, Mullahy and Sindelar
used Epidemiological Catchment Area survey data for four cities, finding that for both genders,
nonalcoholics had higher educational attainment, and were more likely to be working, more
likely to have white-collar jobs, and had higher incomes. Alcoholic women were more likely
than alcoholic men to never marry, have fewer children, and have more psychiatric disorders
(Mullahy & Sindelar 1991).
The problems of causal inference are the same with alcohol dependence as with
determining the influence of current drinking status on productivity. While problematic drinking
probably affects labor force participation, productivity, and earnings (Mangione, et al. 1999)
isolating this effect is not easy from non-experimental data. Mullahy and Sindelar note that
“Other factors may cause both employment and alcohol problems; such factors could include
psychiatric problems, congenital or chronic health problems, injuries, physical pain, lack of
ability to cope, problems with friends or family, frustration of various forms, or an unstable
upbringing (Mullahy & Sindelar 1996, p. 413}.”
Depending on the data source, it may be possible to use multivariate methods to control
for aspects of nature and nurture that lead to drinking problems and have an influence on
schooling, acquisition of other forms of human capital, and work. But usually the available
11

measures in population surveys are inadequate or unreliable.
The statistical challenge is further compounded by the fact that alcohol problems develop
over a number of years, influencing life-course outcomes in a variety of ways. There is strong
evidence that problem drinking in youth affects school completion (Mullahy & Sindelar 1989;
Mullahy & Sindelar 1991; Cook & Moore 1993b; Koch & Kerry Anne McGeary forthcoming)
and family formation (Kenkel & Ribar 1994). Hence the contemporaneous effect of problematic
drinking on work – controlling for education and family circumstances – may miss much of the
long-term effects. Kenkel and Ribar report a series of multivariate-regression results that help
make the point: they find that alcohol-dependent women (age 24-34) earned 11percent more than
those who were not dependent while alcohol-dependent men earned 10 percent less. But when
they add controls for marital status and children, earnings for both males and females are
unaffected by alcohol dependence. The apparent reason: alcohol dependence reduces the
likelihood of getting married, and marriage has opposite effects on work outcomes for men and
women – men work and earn more, women less.
Reverse causation. The drinker’s bonus may be in whole or part an artifact of the reverse
causal process. When their earnings increase, some drinkers increase their alcohol consumption,
and some people who usually abstain become regular drinkers.4 That possibility is supported by
other evidence – we know, for example, that aggregate alcohol sales increase with per capita
income.
4

An alternative possibility for reverse causation is that higher earnings cause drinking initiation
because more lucrative jobs tend to have greater stress associated with them, or have other
attributes that induce drinking (Trice & Sonnenstuhl 1988).
12

Summary. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram that summarizes the causal pathways
under discussion (Cook & Moore 2000). In this diagram, "Current drinking" patterns (both on
and off the job) affect productivity, which in turn determines individual earnings. The diagram
also depicts an indirect effect via the influence of drinking history on the accumulation of human
and health capital (Grossman 1972; Grossman 2000). The final link represents "reverse
causation," in which current consumption is affected by earnings.
Fig. 1 here
Figure 1 identifies several mechanisms by which current drinking and earnings could be
correlated. To isolate the effect of drinking on earnings, a number of analysts have used
instrumental-variable estimation techniques, which also may reduce bias due to errors in the
measurement of drinking (Kenkel & Ribar 1994). The challenge is to find good instruments,
which is to say, variables that satisfy two conditions: (1) they have a strong statistical association
with individual drinking; and (2) they are orthogonal to the error process in the earnings
equation. A long list of instruments have been utilized by economists working on this problem,
as summarized in Table 1. State-level measures of alcohol availability and use, such as excise
taxes or per capita sales, are plausible candidates to satisfy the requirements of a good
instrument, although in some data sets they may not have enough variation to generate the
needed statistical power. Some analysts have used certain individual characteristics as
instruments, including whether the individual suffers from any of several chronic diseases,
characterizations of religious practice, attitudes toward the risk of alcohol and drugs, parents’

13

smoking, and whether the respondent reports having close relatives who are alcoholic. While all
of these variables are correlated with drinking, it is quite likely in each case that they also have a
direct effect on work and earnings. For example, people who attend church frequently drink less
than others, but their religion may also influence their career choices and performance on the job,
and hence earnings. Therefore using some quantitative characterization of religious practice as
an instrument does not identify the effect of drinking per se on earnings.

3. Data and Estimation Strategy
The primary data source for this study is the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(NLSY). The NLSY is managed by the Human Resource Research Center at Ohio State
University, with sponsorship from the US Department of Labor and other federal agencies. The
initial sample included 12,686 youths between the ages of 14 and 21 in 1979, the first year of the
survey. The sampling procedure was designed to include a disproportionate number of racial
minorities and youths in poor households. Sample members were interviewed annually until
1994, and bi-annually since then.
The NLSY includes extensive information on work and earnings, together with data on
family background, schooling, family formation, and a variety of other matters. We utilize the
geocoded version of NLSY data set, which allows us to merge additional variables characterizing
the respondent’s state, metropolitan area, and county of residence. Questions on drinking were
included in 1982-1985 and again in 1988, 1989, 1992 and 1994. Data on work hours and
earnings were obtained by questions concerning the previous calendar year that are included in
14

every wave of the survey; therefore hours and earnings information are available for every year
through 1993, and every other year thereafter. As a result, the 1994 wave could not be used – we
have drinking items that apply to that year, but not earnings and hours.
There are several items that characterize current drinking. In what follows we use a
binary indicator of whether the individual reports having at least one drink in the preceding
month, and the number of times the individual reports having 6 or more drinks on a single
occasion in the preceding month (available in every wave that includes drinking items except
1992). The key employment-related outcome variables are whether the individual reported
working full time in the preceding calendar year, and if so, his or her earnings. We defined “full
time” as at least 1,500 hours with earnings of at least $1,000 (1983 dollars). Full-time work and
earnings are modeled as outcomes of drinking, personal characteristics, and conditions in the
local labor market. Both “short form” and “long form” specifications are used, the difference
being which personal characteristics are included. The short form includes only characteristics
that are exogenous to drinking decisions by the individual, such as demographics, characteristics
of the birth family, aptitude, and so forth. The long form specification expands on this list to
include variables that reflect choices made over the life course which may well be influenced by
prior drinking, including years of schooling, marital status, health, and work experience.
Thus we have
(1)

p(FTitc) = F (Dit, Xit, wtc, utc, eitc)

(2)

Eitc = E(Dit, Xit, wtc, utc, eitc)

where for an individual i in year t and jurisdiction c, the variables are
15

D = a vector of variables describing whether and how much the individual drinks
X = a vector of personal characteristics (either short or long)
w = local wage level
u = local unemployment rate
e = a scalar capturing unmeasured characteristics of individual i

The first pass at estimating these equations treats all right-hand-side variables, including the
drinking variables, as exogenous. In a subsequent section we treat drinking as endogenous and
develop reduced-form estimates. Details of the estimation procedure are given in subsequent
sections.
Table 2 lists the key variables used in these estimates together with mean values for male
and female respondents over all of the years of interest in which they respond. Of particular note
are the two variables that we developed and merged with the NLSY data: the local wage index
and the alcohol-tax index.
We computed the wage index for each Metropolitan Statistical Area from 1990 Census
data from the one-percent sample IPUMS data. A simple earnings equation was estimated for all
respondents age 25-59 who reported full time work in 1989 (and at least $1,000 in earnings): we
regressed the natural log of earnings on indicators of age, race, and education, for males and
females separately. We then computed the difference between the actual annual earnings
number, and the fitted value (both logged), for each of the full-time workers in the sample. The
index for an MSA is simply the average of these differences for respondents from that MSA.
16

This index was merged with NLSY respondents for all years in the working sample, on the
assumption that the geographic structure of wages persists over time. NLSY respondents whose
residence was not in an MSA were assigned to the nearest MSA.
We also constructed an alcohol-tax index to use as an instrument. It is the average excise
tax per ounce of ethanol sold in the respondent’s state, adjusted for inflation. One complication
is that 18 states monopolize the wholesale distribution of liquor rather than simply impose an
excise tax on it; for those states, we imputed the effective tax based on price comparisons with
other states. Details are provided in the appendix.

4. The drinker’s bonus confirmed: regression estimates
Table 3 compares drinkers and non-drinkers for a number of demographic groups with
respect to the fraction who are working full time. In every group, defined here by sex and either
age, race, or AFQT score, the drinkers are more likely to work full time than the abstainers.
Table 4 presents the OLS regression results, short and long form, for males and females,
with and without binge variables. Note that the regressions are computed on the basis of up to
seven years of data on each respondent. The standard errors are robust, corrected for clusters.
The results confirm the existence of the drinker’s bonus. For females it amounts to about
6 percent in the short form and 4 % in the long form (which controls for the respondent’s
education, health, weight, and family circumstances). Females who not only drink but also
binge occasionally still have higher earnings unless they binge 4 or more times per month. For
males the bonus is positive but somewhat smaller than for females, and declines if the individual
17

binge drinks. For males who binge 6 or more times per month, the net effect of drinking is
significantly negative in the short form.
The other results in the earnings equation are also of interest. Not surprisingly, earnings
increase strongly with aptitude (measured by the Air Force Qualification Test), an effect that is
somewhat diminished when we control for acquired human and health capital in the long form.
Perhaps more surprising, earnings increase strongly with height, about 1.0% per inch for females
and 1.8 % per inch for males in the short form. Personality, as represented by self-reported
shyness, has little effect. The local labor market, measured by the county unemployment rate and
the wage index for the local MSA, has a powerful effect on earnings in the expected direction.5
In the long form we confirm the expected patterns with respect to education, marriage
(positive for males), and children at home (negative for females, positive for males). We find a
strong positive effect of accumulated experience since age 21 and experience in the preceding
year. The pattern with respect to the body mass index is surprising. Female earnings are highest
for those who are underweight by the normal standard (less than 18.5). Women of normal weight
earn 5% less, those who are overweight or obese earn 10% less, and those who are highly obese
still less. For males, on the other hand, those in the normal range are paid more than those who
are underweight, and earnings actually peak in the overweight range. Only for those who are in
the highest obesity category is there some decline.
Table 5 presents the logit regression results for full-time work using the same
5

If the wage structure were uniform across geographic markets up to a proportional inflation
factor, and the wage index were successful in measuring that factor without error, then the
estimated coefficient on the wage index should be 1.0. In fact it is about .68 for females and .66
18

specifications as for earnings. For this outcome the estimated effect of being a drinker are large
indeed. In the short form, the odds of a female working full time are about 60 percent higher if
she drinks than abstains, and still higher if she binges occasionally.6 That effect is cut in half in
the long form, but is still large. For males, the odds are about 40 percent higher for drinkers than
nondrinkers in the short form, and about half that in the long form. Bingeing has little effect.
The other results in the full-time logit regressions are generally similar to the patterns
observed for the earnings equations. Aptitude has a particularly strong effect on the odds of a
woman working full time, as does height. The county unemployment rate tends to depress the
odds of full time work, while there are mixed results with respect to the wage index for the local
MSA.
In the long form we confirm the expected patterns with respect to education, marriage
(negative for females, positive for males), and children at home (negative for females, positive
for males). We find a strong positive effect of accumulated experience since age 21 and
experience in the preceding year. But the pattern with respect to the body mass index is quite
different for the odds of full time work than it is for earnings. Respondents who are underweight
are the least likely to work full time, perhaps because this group includes some who are anorexic
or otherwise unwell. Otherwise there is little relationship between weight and working for
females except for those who are severely obese (who are most likely to work). For males there
is a monotonic relationship between BMI and the odds of working.

for males in the long form.
This percentage is computed as the anti-log of the coefficient estimate.

5. The drinker’s bonus denied: IV and reduced-form estimates
The estimated effects of drinking on both earnings and full time work are positive, strong
in a statistical sense, consistent with the literature, and entirely implausible given all the evidence
that among the drinkers are a large subgroup who are drinking in ways that are likely to reduce
productivity (due to hangover or impairment on the job). The estimated coefficients could be
biased for several reasons discussed above, including errors in the measurement of the key
variable (drinking status), omitted variables, and reverse causation. Of those three, reverse
causation strikes us as the most plausible explanation. To remedy this possibility, we reestimated the earnings and full-time equations using instrumental-variables (IV) regression. As
instruments we use an index of alcohol-excise taxes (defined in detail in the appendix), the
excise tax on cigarettes, and the per capita sales of alcoholic beverages measured in terms of
ethanol content per capita. All three of these measures vary at the level of the state and year. In
this choice of instruments we follow Mullahy and Sindelar (Mullahy & Sindelar 1996), with two
exceptions. First, they used the beer tax instead of our more comprehensive index of excise taxes
for beer, wine, and liquor. And second, they included an indicator of whether the respondent
reported growing up with alcoholic relatives, a variable that we believe cannot be plausibly
omitted from the earnings equation given the evidence that parents’ alcoholism may have a
variety of negative effects on the children (and not just cause them to drink).7

7

It is also true that the measure of parental alcoholism may be endogenous. In the NLSY, the
youthful respondents were asked in the 1988 wave whether each of a list of relatives were
alcoholics. Arkes and Cook (2005) reports that in households with more than one NLSY

20

We estimated both short- and long-form 2SLS models, for both the likelihood of fulltime work and for earnings of those who do work full time. Furthermore, we experimented with
either the inclusion of two endogenous variables – both a drinking indicator and an indicator of
abuse. However, regression diagnostics indicate that the results are not to be trusted. The Fstatistic for significance of the excluded instrumental variables is less than 10 in all cases except
the female binary drink variable, indicating that our instruments are rather weak. The secondstage results provide some evidence that drinking and bingeing have a negative effect on labormarket outcomes, but the results are often implausible.
Hence we follow the lead of Dave and Kaestner (2002) and others (Cook & Moore
1993b)in adopting a reduced-form estimation strategy. Our tax index, described in the appendix,
is the key variable in these estimates. The great advantage in the reduced form approach is that
there is no need to characterize drinking patterns directly, thus bypassing the problems of
measurement error and of finding an adequate one- or two-variable description of how much and
in what pattern an individual drinks. Further, the tax variable is of interest because it is under
direct control of policymakers.
Table 6 reports the results of the reduced-form estimates. The estimated coefficients are
positive in all eight cases: male and female, earnings and full time, short form and long form.
All coefficients in the logit equations (full time work) are statistically significant at the usual
level. We take these results as evidence that reduced alcohol consumption, as engendered by
respondent where one reports that their father is an alcoholic a sibling disagrees. Furthermore, in
cases of disagreement there is a strong pattern to the responses, with respondents who report
either abstaining or having problems with alcohol themselves being substantially more likely
21

higher taxes, increases the quantity and perhaps also the quality of work effort.
The magnitude of the estimated effect on the odds of full time work is not small. The
coefficient estimates are around .03, which implies that each additional penny tax (1983 prices)
per ounce of ethanol results in a 3 percent increase in the odds of someone working full time. A
sample calculation is useful. Suppose that 60 percent of some identified population group works
full time, which is then exposed to an alcohol tax increase of 1 cent (1983 prices). Translating
this to current (2006) prices and assuming a 50% markup on the beer excise tax, that would
imply something on the order of a 2% increase in the price of a cheap 6-pack of beer (containing
3 ounces of ethanol). The 3% increase in the odds of full-time work means for this group an
increase in the odds from 1.50 (60/40) to 1.545, which is equivalent to a full-time participation
rate of 60.71%. The price elasticity of full-time participation is thus something less than 1.0 in
this example.
6. Discussion
There is no question that drinkers earn more than non-drinkers and are more likely to
work full time, even after controlling for human capital and local labor market conditions. The
proper interpretation of this finding has been contested in the literature. While some have argued
in favor of a direct causal interpretation, the mechanism is far from obvious. Further, there is
every reason to believe that drinking impairs the productivity of some workers. In this paper we
find evidence in support of the “impairment” hypothesis, namely that higher alcohol prices are
associated with increased participation in full-time work among those in our sample (young

than their siblings to report that their father is an alcoholic.

22

adults in their 20s or early 30s); there is some evidence of increased earnings for full-time
workers as well. A natural reconciliation between these results and the positive association
between drinking and earnings is through the reverse causal process: most income for this age
group is in the form of earnings, and ethanol is a normal commodity in consumption, so that the
main causal mechanism here could be that increased income (in the form of earnings) causes
higher alcohol consumption. Of course we cannot claim that that is the only relevant
mechanism; for example, it is plausible that work away from home provides opportunities to
drink socially that are not so common otherwise, or that work creates stress that is conducive to
drinking. In any event, the notion that alcohol is an elixer that enhances productivity seems very
unlikely.

Appendix

Calculation of Tax Rates and Prices per Oz. of Ethanol
Tax Rates
The original data set had tax rates in $/gallon in real $ (the year’s tax rates divided by the
year’s CPI/100 (1982-84=1)). The tax rates were in every case the sum of state and federal
excises. The real tax rates were then changed to per oz. of ethanol first by multiplying the
gallon figure by 100 (to change the rate to cents per gallon) and then dividing by the number
of ounces of ethanol in each gallon of beer, wine, or liquor. The number of ounces of ethanol
in turn was derived from taking the proportion of ethanol in each gallon of beer, wine, or
liquor and multiplying it by 128. Thus for beer, the percentage of ethanol is 4.5% or, for a
128 oz. gallon, 5.76 oz. of ethanol, therefore the tax rate per gallon of beer was divided by
5.76. For wine the alcohol percentage was 8.34, or 15.35 oz. of ethanol, so the per gallon tax
rate was divided by 15.35. For liquor, a 100-proof gallon was assumed which is 50% ethanol
by content, therefore each gallon tax rate was divided by 64.
Prices
A similar calculation was made for determining the price of each beverage per oz. of
ethanol. The ACCRA price figures were first sorted by state and the mean value for all cities
in each state for each year (1982-2000) was derived. (The number of cities varied per state
from 1 to 32.) The prices were then put in real dollars by dividing each price by the year’s
CPI/100 (1982-84=1). All prices were then multiplied by 100 to derive prices in cents

26

instead of dollars.
The price per ounce of ethanol in liquor was computed by dividing the price per .75 liter
bottle of 86-proof scotch by 10.7 (the number of ounces of ethanol given ethanol content of
43%).
Calculating the Tax Index
For tax rates a weighted average index measure was calculated from the separate beer,
wine and liquor tax rates. Each state tax rate was multiplied by its percentage of ethanol
consumed for that product by each state averaged of the period consumption data was
available (1970-2000). The three rates were then summed to produce the index. An example
of a tax index calculation for one state (Massachusetts) for the year 2000 is below.

The tax index variable could only be calculated where there were beer, wine and liquor
tax rates available, namely the 32 license states and the District of Columbia. To create an index
value for the control states an imputed liquor tax rate was needed. First the net price, price minus
tax, was calculated for 1988 for each license state except Alaska and Hawaii. These net prices
were averaged and the average subtracted from the ACCRA price for each of the monopoly states
for each year. The result was then adjusted to ounce of alcohol to produce an imputed liquor tax
27

for each state for every year.
This imputed tax was then placed in the previously missing liquor tax observations for
all the control states in the regression data set. The weighted tax index variable was then
calculated as before and described in detail above. The imputed spirits tax, the actual beer tax,
and the actual wine tax, weighted by the state-specific fraction of ethanol, were summed to
produce a tax index figure. The only states now missing an alcohol tax index number were New
Hampshire and Utah that also control wine sales and have no wine tax rates available.

Notes: Observations for the years 1982-85, 1988-89, and 1992. “Full time workers” defined as respondents who
reported working at least 1,500 hours in the previous year and had earnings of at least $1000. Standard errors are
Huber-White cluster-corrected for repeated observations on the same individual. All regressions include the
following covariates in addition to those shown: Individual-year indicators for age, from age 22 to age 37; indicators
for each of the 8 years; indicators for father’s and mother’s education; indicators for number of siblings (one, 2-3,
4+); indicators for religious faith in which respondent was raised; indicators of whether the respondent lives in
central city, other SMSA, or outside SMSA; and missing-data indicators for father’s and mother’s education, AFQT,
religious faith, number of siblings, height, personality indicators, unemployment rate, and SMSA region. In the long
form, missing-data indicators are also included for marital status, children at home, experience, hours worked,
schooling, and BMI info. The long form also contains information on whether or not the respondent had an
alcoholic relative. All observations weighted by NLSY sampling weights.
