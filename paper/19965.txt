Household Demand for Low Carbon Public Policies: Evidence from California
Matthew J. Holian and Matthew E. Kahn
NBER Working Paper No. 19965
March 2014
JEL No. Q54,R41
ABSTRACT
In recent years, Californians have voted on two key pieces of low carbon regulation. The resulting
voting patterns provide an opportunity to examine the demand for carbon mitigation efforts. Household
voting patterns are found to mirror the voting patterns by the U.S Congress on national carbon legislation.
Political liberals and more educated voters favor such regulations while suburbanites tend to oppose
such initiatives. Survey responses at the individual level are shown to predict the spatial variation
in actual voting patterns and hence convergent validity for results obtained with stated preference data
on voting markets.

Introduction

Climate change mitigation represents the ultimate collective action problem as
individuals and nations have strong incentives to free ride and wait for others to reduce their
carbon emissions. Even nations that have previously shown a willingness to reduce their
emissions have retreated from ambitious carbon mitigation targets. In April 2013, the European
Parliament rejected tightening their carbon emissions caps.2 This governing body worried that
tighter caps would further slow Europe’s economic growth.
California has enacted low carbon regulation and invested in public infrastructure seeking
to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Two recent examples of these efforts are the California
Global Warming Solutions Act (AB32)3 and the California High Speed Rail (HSR) project.
Passed in 2006, AB32 represents one of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s major legislative
successes. AB32 bundles a suite of policies, including a carbon cap and trade market, as it seeks
to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 1990’s level by the year 2020 and
to 80% below the 1990 baseline by the year 2050. HSR is a statewide project to build a train
that will travel from San Diego to San Francisco and is projected to reduce reliance on air travel
and private vehicles for travelling in the state. This is a long run project that requires billions of
state and federal dollars.
From a research perspective, a novel feature of both of these ambitious pieces of low
carbon policy is that California voters had the opportunity to express their preferences over them.
California has long been known as a center of direct democracy (Matsusaka 2005). In fall 2010,
California voters rejected Proposition 23 that sought to void the AB32 regulation. This

Proposition garnered 38% of the total vote in 2010. In 2008, 52.7% of voters approved of
issuing nearly $10 billion in bonds to finance the development of a high-speed rail project.
This paper studies voting on these low carbon initiatives using precinct and census block
group level data. We also use micro survey data to test hypotheses concerning the support for
low carbon policies. We document that stated preferences based on micro data are highly
informative about predicting local aggregate voting patterns (Luttmer 2001).
Our central focus is documenting the role that political ideology and economic geography
plays in determining voting patterns on low carbon policies. We posit that political liberals are
more likely to support such legislation. In addition, we explore the role that suburban living
plays in determining voter support. As we discuss below, suburbanites face higher costs for
complying with low carbon regulation’s requirements and are located physically further from
new rail transit infrastructure. These “price effects” should, all else equal, reduce suburban
support for such policies.
The Two California Low Carbon Ballot Initiatives
Proposition 23 sought to place a moratorium on the rollout of California’s ambitious
climate change mitigation efforts (known as Assembly Bill 32 (AB32)). It was signed into law in
2006 by Governor Schwarzenegger, and is a landmark piece of environmental regulation. Prop
23 would have suspended AB32, until the unemployment rate fell to 5.5% for one full year.
Thus, a vote for Proposition 23 is a vote against California’s unilateral efforts to reduce its
greenhouse gas emissions.
The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also known as AB32, is a California state
law that requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from all sources throughout the state to 1990 levels by 2020. This represents
3

emissions reductions of about 25% with much more stringent emissions reductions required by
the year 2050 (Hanemann 2008). The penalties for missing these targets are not known.
AB32 represents a bundle of several types of regulations and market mechanisms
targeting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The largest policy in CARB’s toolbox is the cap and
trade system, which in 2013 went into effect for electric utilities and large industrial facilities,
and in 2015 is scheduled to go into effect for distributors of transportation, natural gas and other
fuels. In addition to the cap and trade system, CARB is responsible for overseeing numerous
regulations, including a first-in-the-country GHG emissions standards for light duty vehicles,
subsequently adopted by other states and the federal government. Other regulations include an
aggressive renewable portfolio standard for the electric utilities so that 33% of the state’s power
is to be generated by low carbon wind and solar power by the year 2020.4 An open debate
continues on the likely impact of such regulation on electricity prices. Some industry consulting
studies have claimed that these costs are very high.5
The second political issue we study is voter support for California’s high speed rail. In
2008, voters approved Prop 1A. The Voter Information pamphlet for that election described
Prop 1A (the “Safe, reliable high-speed passenger train bond act.”) as:

To provide Californians a safe, convenient, affordable, and reliable alternative to driving
and high gas prices; to provide good-paying jobs and improve California's economy
while reducing air pollution, global warming greenhouse gases, and our dependence on
foreign oil, shall $9.95 billion in bonds be issued to establish a clean, efficient high-speed
train service linking Southern California, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Valley, and the
San Francisco Bay Area, with at least 90 percent of bond funds spent for specific
projects, with private and public matching funds required, including, but not limited to,
federal funds, funds from revenue bonds, and local funds, and all bond funds subject to
independent audits? Fiscal Impact: State costs of $19.4 billion, assuming 30 years to pay
both principal and interest costs of the bonds. Payments would average about $647

million per year. When constructed, unknown operation and maintenance costs, probably
over $1 billion annually; at least partially, and potentially fully, offset by passenger
fares.6
Figure 1 displays a map of California and shows the HSR’s station stops. This figure
highlights that this place-based multi-billion dollar investment will have differential effects
across California. Previous research has examined how Europe’s high-speed rail has impacted
economic activity (Brakman, Garretse and Schramm 2000). Information provided to ballot
voters in 2008 stated that the train would reach top speeds of 220 MPH and allow for a travel
time from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about 2½ hours for about $50 per person.7
High-speed rail is explicitly described as a low carbon form of transportation. The
California Air Resources Board subsequently approved a California HSR Authority report that
documents the level of greenhouse gas reductions resulting from the bullet train project.8
Figures 2 and 3 display the cross-county spatial distribution in the share of voters who
voted in favor of each of these initiatives. Recall that a vote in favor of Prop 23 is an “anticarbon vote” (because it would freeze the implementation of AB32). The figures clearly show
that coastal California is more pro-transit and pro-environment than the rest of the state, as is the
northern portion, at least along the coast.

The Determinants of Low Carbon Voting
AB32 represents a bundle of different efforts to reduce every sector’s carbon emissions.
One major piece of this effort is the nation’s first carbon cap and trade market. This new market
will raise the price of both gasoline and electricity.
In comparing the private benefits and costs of supporting a piece of carbon mitigation
regulation, it is intuitive that environmentalists will gain greater benefits from enacting such
regulation. There is a subset of the population who loses utility from polluting and this creates a
personal incentive for these individuals to engage in voluntary restraint even when they face no
Pigouvian incentive not to pollute (Kotchen and Moore 2008).
In this section, we present a rational choice model of voting in favor of low carbon
legislation. Each person gains utility from private consumption, , housing, , and loses utility
from its emissions of carbon. For simplicity, we assume that the population has the same
preferences over consumption and housing and that carbon enters the utility function in an
additively separable component. The population differs with respect to its disutility from
producing pollution. For people who are free riders,

equals zero in equation (1), while a larger

indicates a greater willingness to engage in voluntary restraint.9
,

(1)

In addition to differing with respect to , households also differ with respect to their hourly
wage, measured in dollars and defined as

. In equation (1), carbon is a choice variable that

will be a function of household transportation and housing choices.10

9

Each household views themselves as small in the market economy and thus aggregate carbon emissions are
unaffected by each household’s contribution to the total stock of the pollutant. We could augment the utility
function to include the aggregate stock of carbon emissions. Those with a larger “B” for private carbon emissions
would derive more disutility from the growing aggregate GHG stock.
10
In our model, we do not explicitly incorporate other features of geography such as summer temperature. In
California, areas closer to the water are both more expensive and feature cooler summers. Inland residents will

6

Each household must commute to the city center by car or by bus. To simplify the
problem, we assume that commuters rent access to the bus or car. The car is more expensive
and emits more carbon per mile than the bus (because of economies of scale for public transit)
but the car is faster. The car’s rental price is

and the bus’s daily rental price (i.e. its fare) is

.
In addition to choosing a commuting mode, each household must also choose the distance
from the city center at which it lives, and the quantity of housing it will consume. These choices
in turn also determine the household’s carbon production. The hedonic pricing gradient
determines the price of housing at each distance from the city center. Homes closer to the city
center will be more expensive (because a shorter commute is a desirable attribute) and at any
distance from the city center, the price of a home will be an increasing function of its size. Call

Equation (2) presents the budget constraint for a person who chooses to commute by car.
The left side of the equation represents the total income this person earns. Note that total income
recognize that they will consume more electricity during the summer to cool their homes. In our empirical results
below, we will include county fixed effects.

is a decreasing function of his commute distance (holding speed of the car constant). His total
income is greater if the speed of the car is faster because he has more time to work. This car
commuter’s expenditure is presented on the right side of the budget constraint where he can buy
private consumption, housing and one car rental. This car driver must pay the market price for
a gallon of gasoline,

, where the number of gallons required depends on commute distance
. Equation (3) presents the budget

and vehicle fuel efficiency (miles per gallon,)

constraint for the bus rider. Bus riders do not pay for gasoline and the bus speed is slower and
the bus ticket is cheaper than renting a car.
Finally, equations (4) and (5) distinguish this model from classic monocentric city
models with a transport modal choice (Leroy and Sonstelie 1983, Glaeser, Kahn and Rapapport
2008). These equations represent the carbon production functions for bus commuters and car
commuters, respectively. The household’s carbon production is an increasing function of his
commute’s total gasoline consumption and thus is weighted by the carbon emissions factor

if

he commutes by car. If he commutes by bus, we must incorporate that the bus is a club good. In
this case we take the total gasoline consumption to move the bus an extra mile and divide by the
parameter

, which the household treats as the historical average occupancy of the

bus, to calculate each person’s share of total bus gasoline consumption. Multiplying this amount
by

yields the amount of carbon generated by the average bus rider, per mile from the city

center. Finally, the term

reflects that for any house of size , electricity consumption

scales with the size of the home. Those who live in larger suburban homes will consume more
electricity. Given that over 80% of U.S power is generated using coal and natural gas, this will
increase carbon emissions. In this case,

factor. This term would drop out if the utility generated its power with zero carbon wind and
solar.11
Solving this maximization problem as a function of
comparative statics.

Fixing the wage

and

yields the following

, a person who has a slightly higher

will live in a

smaller house, closer to the city center and be more likely to commute by public transit. Holding
constant, a higher wage household will be more likely to live closer to the city center, in a
bigger home, and to commute by car.

Households with a very low , and households with

moderate wages would be the most likely to locate far from the city center. There, they could
enjoy a large home and commute by car to reduce their commute time. Such low B suburban
households would lose little direct utility due to the carbon they create.
In this economy, household carbon production will be an increasing function of distance
to the city center. Further from the city center, the homes are bigger, the commute is longer, and
people are more likely to commute by the high carbon private car mode. To provide a sample of
the magnitude of the extra operating costs imposed by AB32, suppose that in the near future that
the cap and trade provisions raise the price of gasoline by 50 cents a gallon in California. A
center city resident with easy access to public transit will face a lower cost imposed by this
regulation than a suburban home owner who drives 15,000 miles per year in an SUV that
achieves 20 miles per gallon. Under these assumptions, this suburban household will face a
marginal increase in transportation cost of $375 per year due to the carbon regulation. This
example highlights how locational choice and past durables choices together determine the price
of complying with carbon regulation.

11

Note that we are assuming that private consumption generates zero carbon. It would be simple to relax this
assumption or we could augment the model to have multiple types of consumption that differ with respect to their
carbon content.

9

In this model, those eager to engage in voluntary restraint choose to live close to the city
center and choose a commuting mode (the bus) such that the costs they face from AB32 are
lower than those who live in the suburbs in a large home, and who commute by private car. In
this sense, personal ideology determines the economic price that voters face for complying with
new regulation.
This point distinguishes carbon voting from other pieces of environmental regulation. In
past work, Peltzman (1984) and Kahn and Matsusaka (1997) have argued that economic factors
(rather than ideology) are the dominant determinant of voting on environmental referenda. For
example, Kahn and Matsusaka document that counties featuring a larger share of agricultural
interests are more likely to vote against environmental regulation that potentially lowers this
sector’s profitability.
In the case of carbon voting, a household’s locational choice is jointly determined by its
ideology and its economics circumstances. As highlighted by our model, the interplay of the
parameters B and W determine the cost of voting in favor of carbon mitigation. We could
further enrich our model by incorporating the fact that households have “locked in” to a set of
durables and a residential community where they have formed their social networks and have
local knowledge over shopping opportunities.12 Those who have chosen the suburbs will
recognize that it is more costly for them to comply with low carbon regulation mandates. If
homes and cars are durable owned assets, rather than rented assets, then the suburbanites who
own fuel inefficient vehicles will suffer an asset loss from the introduction of carbon pricing.
Standard reasoning from urban economics predicts increased costs of transportation will be
12

We recognize that our model is static. In a more realistic dynamic model, households would purchase durables
such as their home and their car. It is reasonable to assume that AB32’s introduction represented a surprise for
California’s voters who had purchased such durables years before. Future research should study how the
expectation of rising energy prices in California affects durables demand relative to durables demand by
observationally identical households who live in states that are not expected to enact cap and trade legislation.

10

capitalized into lower prices for suburban real estate—and higher prices of urban land (Blake
2012, Sexton, Wu and Zilberman 2012).
This model has implications for voting on Proposition 23. Consumers make decisions
knowing their own private disutility from polluting, their . It is reasonable to assume that those
people with a high

also derive higher private benefits from enacting AB32’s goals of reducing

California’s greenhouse gas emissions and serving as a guinea pig for the rest of the world. This
suggests that

is positively correlated with the private benefits of voting for AB32. As we

discussed above, all else equal, consumers with a higher

will face a lower cost of voting

against Prop 23 because their carbon production is lower as they live closer to the city center in
small homes and commute using public transit.
Distance to the city center should also have implications for voting on high-speed rail.
Given that the station stops will be in the center cities, those who live downtown will have better
access than those who live in suburbs of the metropolitan areas along the route. Our residential
sorting model also suggests that those with a taste for voluntary restraint will be more likely to
live closer to the city center. Under the assumption that people with a taste for voluntary
restraint (i.e a high

in equation (1)), care about reducing California’s total stock of GHG

emissions, then these same individuals should be more likely to support HSR.

The Empirical Framework

To study the determinants of support for low carbon legislation in California, we study
two types of data. The first will be household level surveys of support for the two propositions

11

and the second set will be actual voting at the census block group level. Following the earlier
literature on environmental voting, we will include standard demographic controls such as age,
ethnicity, education and income.13 In terms of the socioeconomic variables, we expected that
more educated, richer voters will support carbon mitigation.
We are especially interested in the role of political ideology in the household or in the
neighborhood where the household lives, and the role of urban form where urban form will be
measured by distance to the center city and the population density in the household’s local
geographic area.
In studying California voter behavior, when using survey data we estimate the following
model:

12

the coefficient vector on these terms. We will estimate equation (7) using ordinary least squares
(OLS), while weighting the observations by the total number of votes in precinct to mitigate
heteroskedasticity concerns.14 For conceptual clarity, we use the same notation on the right-hand
side of equations (6) and (7). This is a slight abuse of notation as the measures in the

, and

vectors, though capturing identical concepts, are made of up variables taken from survey
responses in equation (6), whereas the measures in equation (7) are block group level aggregates.
The urban form variables are meant to capture the forces we discussed in the previous
section’s model. All else equal, we predict that households who live closer to a metropolitan
area’s city center will be more likely to vote against Prop 23. In previous research, we have
documented that households who live closer to the city center drive less (Holian and Kahn 2014).
Suburban residents also spend more on electricity than observationally identical center city
residents (see Glaeser and Kahn 2010).
In the economic model presented earlier, we simultaneously modeled the choice of
residential location, commute mode and housing demand. All else equal, high “B” households
will choose to live closer to the city center and will configure their lives to have a minimal
environmental externality impact. Such households will face a low cost of voting for low carbon
regulation. This “B” parameter is known by the households but cannot be observed by the
econometrician. One way to proxy for this is to use political party registration data. We are
implicitly assuming that Democrats have a high “B”. Costa and Kahn (2013) document that
political liberals consume less electricity than observationally identical households and consume

14

Technically, the unit of analysis in our study of the voting data is the block group. We merge voting data to block
groups. However, it is less intuitive to describe “the percent of the block group voting for X”, because most readers
know that in the U.S. voting takes place in precincts whose boundaries rarely coincide perfectly with block groups.

13

even less on hot summer months. Kahn (2007) document that political liberals are more likely
to own hybrid vehicles and to install solar panels.
Figure 4 documents where Democrats and Republicans live within California’s
metropolitan areas. More than 50% of residents who live within five miles of a city center are
Democrats. This share shrinks monotonically with distance from the city center. In contrast,
roughly 25% of residents who live within five miles of a city center are Republicans and this
share rises monotonically with distance from the city center. Note the fractions of Democrats and
Republicans do not sum to one in the figure as there are a number of independent voters and
those who register within one of several minor parties.
Our reduced form estimates of the voting propensities represents a conditional analysis.
Given where households have chosen to live, we study their voting patterns. We acknowledge
that we do not explicitly model the residential locational choice decision. 15 In the absence of
random assignment of households to different distances from the city center, we cannot recover
the causal effect of suburbanization on opposing low carbon policy efforts.
While we acknowledge this point, it is important to note that households also choose their
locations based on many idiosyncratic factors that are unlikely to be correlated with their
propensities to vote on environmental legislation. People differ with respect to their place of
work with some working downtown and others working in the suburbs (Glaeser and Kahn 2001).
People differ with respect to whether they have school-aged children and whether they are
willing to use the center city public schools. Some households may have a strong taste for the
downtown culture and retail opportunities and the city center’s consumer city (Glaeser, Kolko
and Saiz 2001). Households may seek to live near a family member who can help with
babysitting or near an elderly parent who requires their assistance. These examples highlight
15

We know of no empirical studies that jointly examine where households choose to live and how they vote.

14

that households are sorting within metropolitan areas for many reasons that may be independent
of the unobserved determinants of voting on low carbon legislation. We must rely on the fact
that we have included a detailed set of explanatory variables in our attempt to isolate the
association between geographic location and support for low carbon policies.

Data
We obtained our data from a variety of sources. The Statewide Database (SWDB) at UC
Berkeley distributes statement of vote files matched to Census blocks for elections between 1992
and present. The two survey data sets we analyze were both collected by the Public Policy
Institute of California (PPIC).
For our analysis of voting data, we merge additional variables to the data supplied by
SWDB, namely the 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) Five-Year Estimates
(which replaced the decennial Census as the primary source for important socioeconomic
variables, including income and education at the block-group level.)
The survey data was collected in July 2010 and in March of 2012. The 2010 survey
asked about opinions towards global warming in general and AB32 in particular, although it did
not specifically name Proposition 23. One important characteristic of this survey for our
purposes is the availability of zip code identifiers for respondents, thus allowing us to calculate
measures of distance from zip code centroids to downtown, as well as neighborhood population
density.16 The 2010 PPIC survey also asked the following question,
Next, to address global warming, do you favor or oppose the state law that requires

Though not as refined as our measure of these variables calculated using block group centroids in the voting data.

15

California to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2020?
While the 2012 PPIC survey asked:
Do you favor or oppose building a high-speed rail system in California? (favor, oppose)
We coded “favor” answers to these questions as one, “oppose” answers as zero, and we
dropped the few dozen respondents who either refused to answer or were unsure.
To proxy for environmental ideology, we include voting indicators. To study voting on
both propositions, we use the fraction of the block group voting for George Bush in the 2004
election as a control for ideology. Snyder (1996) documents that political party registration data
is an important correlate of voting on California referenda. For the survey data, we drop all
unregistered voters, and generate an indicator variable equal to one if the respondent is a
registered Republican.
The variable lnDISTANCE was created by merging geocodes to the ACS block group
and the PPIC zip code level data, and then using the 2006 definitions of metropolitan areas, we
calculated the distance from each block group to the center of the MSA in which the block group
or zip code is in. For block groups and zip codes that are not in an MSA, we set their distance
equal to 80 kilometers, which is the location we have arbitrarily chosen as the urban fringe.
Given the presence of some zero and very low distances and densities, we take the natural log of
one plus the distance in kilometers. Similarly, the lnDENSITY variable is the natural log of one
plus population density at the block group level, measured as population by land area, measured
in square miles.
Our study’s variable definitions and summary statistics are reported in Tables 1 through
4. Comparing the variable descriptions in Tables 1 and 2 clarifies the differences between the
component variables of the

, and

vectors in equations (6) and (7). For example, lnINC is

16

the natural log of (one plus) block group average household income in the aggregate data, and
the natural log of (one plus) the respondent’s self-reported income in the survey data. Tables 3
and 4 provide summary statistics for the three datasets. Across the two surveys most averages
are quite similar; one exception is that the average value of BLACK was 19% in the 2010 survey
but 7% in the 2012 survey. In comparison, the average value of BLACK was 6% in the
aggregate data. As a general statement, the survey data appear to slightly oversample older,
richer, more educated and more liberal voters.

Results
Table 5 reports four regressions to investigate the correlates of support for AB32. The
first two columns report estimates of equation (7) using the block group level data while the last
two columns report estimates of equation (6) using the survey data. It is important to note that in
columns (1) and (2) the dependent variable is the share of the block group who voted “no” on
Prop 23 so this is indicative of support for AB32. We transform the dependent variable so we
can directly compare the precinct level regressions with the survey regressions. County fixed
effects are included in each regression.
Table 5 highlights the similarities and the differences in the results between the precinct
regressions and the survey regressions. To streamline this discussion, we focus on the results
reported in columns (2) and (4) where we include the political variables. Across the
specifications, we consistently find that Republicans oppose AB32. A ten percentage point
increase in the share of registered Republicans reduces the probability of voting “No” on Prop 23
by 5.5 percentage points. To compare with the survey data, we consider a 100 percentage point
increase, which reduces the probability of voting no on Prop 23 by 55 percentage points. This

17

compares with the 37 percentage point reduction associated with the results from the survey data
in column (4). Both results suggest ideology has a very large effect on support for carbon
mitigation regulation.
A second finding is that those who live at higher population density and closer to the city
center are more likely to favor AB32. While the urban form variables are statistically
significant and of the expected signs, they do not explain as much as ideology.17
One new finding is that controlling for education, richer people are not more likely to
support AB32. The standard J-curve logic is that richer people and nations are more likely to
support environmental regulation. The income effect’s magnitude shrinks when we control for
the community’s political party voting. As shown in Tables 5 and 6, both homeowners and
homeowner communities consistently vote against low carbon regulation.
Several of the demographic variables do not yield similar findings in the survey micro
regressions and the precinct level regressions. While more educated people support AB32, this
variable is statistically insignificant in the survey regressions. Relatively few demographic
variables are statistically significant in the survey regressions.18

17

In unreported results, we estimated restricted models with county fixed effects and ideology only, and also
models with urban form and fixed effects only, and the R-squared in the former restricted model is much higher. As
a robustness check, we also estimated a specification using the voting data that included the fraction of voters
registered with the Green Party. The coefficient on this variable had the theoretically expected sign, was statistically
significant, and was larger in magnitude in the Prop 23 model than the Prop 1A model. The R-squared increased
only very slightly when we included this additional measure of ideology, and the coefficients on the other variables,
specifically the urban form variables (lnDISTANCE and lnDENSITY) also changed only very slightly. These
results are available upon request.
18

We carried out several joint F-tests. We reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on all of the demographic
variables are jointly zero (p<0.01), and we reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the race and ethnicity
variables are jointly zero (p<0.01). However, we do not reject the hypothesis that lnINC and COLLEGE are jointly
zero (p<0.14) in the survey data results for AB32.

Table 6 reports the high-speed rail results.

Richer people oppose it while more

educated people support it. Similar to the voting on AB32, people who live further from the city
at lower population density oppose it and Republicans are less likely to support it.
Homeownership is found to reduce support for HSR on average. At first glance, this is a
surprising result. In the case of high-speed rail, voters should recognize that there will be a
direct real estate capitalization effect for those who live closer to the planned station stops.
Recent evidence from China’s bullet trains (see Zheng and Kahn 2013) documents positive
capitalization effect of distance to the rail stop.
HSR represents a complex treatment because of its implications for existing land use
patterns. In the major cities, suburban NIMBY’s and in agricultural areas, farmers, have used
their voice to vote against Prop 1A and also to challenge its legality. At the same time, a
majority of voters did support Prop 1A in Central Valley areas like Bakersfield and Fresno,
which are historically conservative areas but which will effectively become suburbs of Los
Angeles and San Francisco once HSR is built. However Prop 1A did not receive the support of a
majority of voters, even in some Central Valley communities where the train will stop.19
Fischel (2001) describes the powerful incentives faced by homeowners to vote, and more
generally behave, in ways consistent with improving but especially preserving the value of their
homes.20

19

In Fresno, Kern, Merced and San Joaquin a majority of voters approved Prop 1A, while in Stanislaus, Sacramento,
Kings, Madera and Tulare a minority approved. The three largest city in these counties are Fresno (461,116),
Sacramento (456,441 ) and Bakersfield (295,536, which is in Kern County.) Population as of 2005. For an
overview of these issues see: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/20/calif-high-speedrail/3090811/
20
We visited Fresno in spring of 2013 and attended a realtor conference. One of the speakers, a realtor specializing
in agricultural land, provided anecdotal evidence that agricultural land values in the area were indeed on the rise,
and moreover that out of town buyers from places like San Francisco were increasingly involved in transactions.
Although he attributed this to a rise in almond prices rather than speculation fueled by HSR, this is suggestive and
future research should disentangle these various effects of HSR on property values.

Self Reported Low Carbon Preferences and Aggregate Voting Outcomes

In this section, we follow Luttmer (2001) and use the survey regression results to test
whether the marginal effects generated from survey data are informative in predicting aggregate
voting outcomes. We use the results from equation (6) and take the regression coefficient vector
and multiply this by community level demographics and predict each census tract’s average
likelihood of supporting low carbon regulation. We then correlate this predicted index with the
actual aggregate voting data. If the survey results are truthfully reported then the regression
estimates should have some predictive power of actual voting behavior. Table 7 reports the
results. We find a strong positive correlation between these two measures of preferences for low
carbon regulation.
The scatterplot presented in Figure 5 shows the actual block group vote share on the yaxis and the predicted vote share (calculated without fixed effects, given our survey sample did
not contain respondent data from the majority of counties) on the x-axis. In his study of welfare
preferences, Luttmer found the adjusted R-squared in this simple regression to be 0.407. Fitting
a straight line to the points in our scatter plot, the adjusted R-squared is 0.685.
Discussion
In recent years, more and more people are living further from city centers. Table 8
presents data for the U.S metropolitan population for each decade from 1970 to 2010 on the
share of residents who live within different distance bands of the city center. In each row, the
entries sum to one. In 1970, 31.6% of the metropolitan population lived within five miles of the
city center while by the year 2010, this percentage had shrunk to 16.9%. In 1970, the share
living within ten miles of the city center was 57.2% and this had shrunk to 35.7% by 2010. In
20

Tables 5 and 6, we documented a negative correlation between living further from the city center
and favoring low carbon policies. If this correlation represents a causal effect, then this
suburbanization trend has implications for the political economy of low carbon voting.
The link between suburbanization and carbon production, as highlighted by our model,
can be attenuated by the introduction of more fuel-efficient vehicles and electricity generated by
zero carbon renewable power. If these products exist, then a suburbanite’s GHG emissions
would be roughly equal to his center city counterpart. In this case, the cost of voting for low
carbon regulation would fall significantly for suburbanites.

Conclusion
In recent years, California’s voters have had the opportunity to repeal the low carbon
AB32 regulation and to choose whether to go forward with investing in costly High-Speed Rail.
In both cases, the voters chose the low carbon choice but there was significant spatial variation in
the support for these measures. Controlling for standard demographics such as ethnicity,
education and income, we have focused on the role of political affiliation and geography as
correlates of low carbon voting. We find that political liberals consistently support low carbon
initiatives.
All else equal, those who live further from the city center are more likely to oppose low
carbon policies. The U.S is a suburban nation with the median metropolitan area resident living
9.9 miles from the city center and 25% of the population living at least 17.1 miles away from the
city center in the year 2000. Relative to nations with more urbanized populations, people in the
U.S drive more, live in larger homes and consume more electricity. This fossil fuel driven
lifestyle raises the short run price of voting in favor of carbon mitigation regulation.

21

Our findings mirror nationwide findings concerning the correlates of Congressional
voting on low carbon legislation such as the 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act
concludes that Representatives whose districts are rich, liberal and low carbon are much more
likely to vote in favor of carbon mitigation (Cragg et. al. 2013).
Together these results highlight that even within a well known “Blue State” such as
California that there is both an ideological divide and a city versus suburb divide on carbon
mitigation policy efforts. While economists have stressed the insurance benefits from avoiding
“known unknown” fat tail risks (Weitzman 2009, Pindyck 2011), subsets of voters are rejecting
this vision.
Past political economy studies have stressed that voters will oppose environmental
regulations that threaten their jobs (Kahn and Matsusaka 1997). This paper has presented new
evidence on the role that residential lifestyle choices and ideology play in determining low
carbon voting patterns. Given existing technologies, our results suggest that the
suburbanization of the median voter poses a challenge for policy makers who seek to have the
United States lead in international efforts to sign a global carbon treaty.
