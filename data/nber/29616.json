    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper develops a method to infer causal effects of treatments on choices, by exploiting relationships between choices and hypothetical evaluations. Under specified conditions, it can recover treatment effects even if the treatment does not vary across observations in the sample. Additional advantages include more comprehensive recovery of heterogeneous treatment effects and potential improvements in precision. These advantages can also be attained in some environments where treatment is assigned endogenously. We provide proof of concept by using the approach to estimate the price responsiveness of the demand for snack foods in the laboratory, and the response of contributions to the availability of matching funds on a microfinance website.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nThank you to multiple seminar and conference participants for helpful comments. Detailed suggestions from Richard Carson and Laura Taylor were especially helpful. This paper is related to a previous working paper, \u201cNon-Choice Evaluations Predict Behavioral Responses to Changes in Economic Conditions,\u201d by Bernheim, Bj\u00f6rkegren, Naecker, and Antonio Rangel; it uses data from the same lab experiment, but most of the methodological analysis is new, as is the field application. We are especially grateful to Antonio Rangel for his contributions to the earlier project. We are also grateful to Irina Weisbrott for assistance with collecting the laboratory data. Bernheim acknowledges financial support from the National Science Foundation through grant SES-1156263. Bj\u00f6rkegren thanks the W. Glenn Campbell and Rita Ricardo-Campbell National Fellowship at Stanford University, and Microsoft Research for support. Pollmann was supported generously by the B.F. Haley and E.S. Shaw Fellowship for Economics through a grant to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. The components of this study were overseen by the IRBs of Stanford University or Brown University. The field experiment in this study was pre-registered with the AEA RCT Registry (AEARCTR-0004885); the lab experiment was conducted prior to the establishment of the registry.
