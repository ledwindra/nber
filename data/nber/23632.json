    "abstract": "\n\nWe provide the \ufb01rst general empirical test of tax invariance (TIV). When a 25 per-cent tax remitted by manufacturers was eliminated in Washington state and the retail cannabis excise tax was simultaneously increased from 25 to 37 percent\u2014a shift in-tended to be revenue-neutral\u2014TIV did not hold. Manufacturers kept two-thirds of their tax savings instead of passing all their savings through to retail \ufb01rms via lower prices as predicted by TIV. One-third of the retail tax increase was passed on to consumers via higher retail prices \u2013 TIV would have predicted constant or even declining tax-inclusive retail prices.\n\n",
