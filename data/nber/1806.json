This \"Aggregate Information Hypothesis\" explains the effect without reference to Federal Reserve intervention in the funds market. In this paper I provide a formal model of the Aggregate Information Hypothesis under lagged reserve accounting.The model relies on imperfect information in the funds market, and on imperfect bank arbitrage of reserve demand between days of the week. Some stylized facts are presented about funds rate behavior in the period 1980-1983.\n\n",
