JEL No. E4,F3,F40
ABSTRACT
We estimate an empirical model of exchange rates with transitory and permanent monetary
shocks. Using monthly post-Bretton-Woods data from the United States, the United Kingdom,
and Japan, we report four main findings: First, there is no exchange rate overshooting in response
to either temporary or permanent monetary shocks. Second, a transitory increase in the nominal
interest rate causes appreciation, whereas a permanent increase in the interest rate causes shortrun depreciation. Third, transitory increases in the interest rate cause short-run deviations from
uncovered interest-rate parity in favor of domestic assets, whereas permanent increases cause
deviations against domestic assets. Fourth, permanent monetary shocks explain the majority of
short-run movements in nominal exchange rates.

Introduction

How do monetary disturbances affect exchange rates and cross-country return differentials?
A defining characteristic of the vast existing literature devoted to elucidating this question
is the assumption that monetary shocks come in only one type. The contribution of the
present paper is to distinguish between temporary and permanent monetary shocks. Doing
so reveals that the effects of these two types of shock on exchange rates and cross-country
asset return differentials are diametrically opposed.
Much of the academic interest in the question posed above originated in the mid 1970s,
when the developed world abandoned an existing fixed-exchange-rate agreement, known as
the Bretton Woods system, in favor of floating rates and independent monetary policy. A
seminal theoretical contribution by Dornbusch (1976) derived what came to be known as
the exchange-rate overshooting effect, whereby an expansionary monetary shock causes a
depreciation of the domestic currency that is larger in the short run than in the long run.
Dornbusch’s overshooting result is based on three assumptions: a liquidity effect of monetary
policy, uncovered interest rate parity, and long-run purchasing power parity.
In the past decades, a number of empirical studies, starting with the seminal contribution
by Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), have tested the validity of Dornbusch’s assumptions and
results. Two main conclusions emerge from this body of work. First, the empirical evidence
is consistent with the exchange-rate overshooting result. Some papers find that overshooting
occurs on impact, as suggested by Dornbusch’s model (Kim and Roubini, 2000; Faust and
Rogers, 2003; Kim, Moon, and Velasco, 2017), while others find that it takes place in a
delayed fashion (Eichenbaum and Evans, 1995; Scholl and Uhlig, 2008). Second, contrary to
one of Dornbusch’s key assumptions, the available empirical studies find that a contractionary
monetary shock causes a persistent deviation from uncovered interest rate parity in favor of
domestic interest-bearing assets.
This paper contributes to the existing empirical literature by allowing for the existence of
two types of monetary policy shocks, permanent and transitory ones. Permanent monetary
1

shocks are ones that cause long-run changes in the nominal interest rate. By contrast, transitory monetary shocks cause no changes in the nominal interest rate in the long run. The
empirical model extends the closed economy model with permanent and transitory monetary shocks developed by Uribe (2018) to allow for a foreign block that includes the nominal
exchange rate and the foreign nominal interest rate. As in Uribe’s model, we assume that
the domestic nonstationary monetary shock is cointegrated with domestic inflation and the
domestic interest rate. Also in line with that study, we identify the domestic transitory
monetary shock by assuming that transitory increases in the policy rate cause a nonpositive
impact effect on domestic inflation and output. In addition to domestic transitory and permanent monetary shocks, the present formulation introduces a foreign permanent monetary
shock with the property of being cointegrated with the foreign nominal interest rate. Finally,
the empirical model assumes that the depreciation rate is cointegrated with the cross-country
inflation differential, which implies that the real depreciation rate is stationary.
We estimate the model on monthly data covering the period 1974:1 to 2018:3. The
domestic economy is taken to be the United States and the foreign economy either the
United Kingdom or Japan. The focus of the analysis is on the effect of permanent and
transitory monetary disturbances in the United States on the dollar exchange rate and on
the excess return on U.S. assets.
When transitory and permanent monetary shocks are modeled separately, the main results of the existing empirical literature change in significant ways. Transitory increases in
the nominal interest rate cause a persistent appreciation of the domestic currency and permanent increases cause a persistent depreciation. Importantly, in both cases, the short-run
effect on the exchange rate is weaker than at any point in the future, implying the absence
of an overshooting effect. We interpret this finding as suggesting that the overshooting result present in models featuring a single monetary shock could be the result of confounding
monetary impulses.
The distinction between transitory and permanent monetary shocks also has important

2

consequences for the dynamics of interest rate differentials. We find that, as in the related
empirical literature, a transitory increase in the nominal interest rate causes a short-run
departure from uncovered interest rate parity in favor of domestic assets. By contrast, a
permanent increase in the nominal interest rate causes a departure from uncovered interest
rate parity against domestic assets. This result suggests that carry-trade speculation conditional on monetary shocks might involve more risk than is implied by estimates that do not
distinguish permanent from transitory shocks.
The effects of permanent monetary shocks would be of little economic importance if such
disturbances were found to account for a small fraction of exchange rate movements. But
we find that this is not the case. The estimated empirical model predicts that domestic and
foreign permanent monetary shocks jointly explain the majority of the forecast error variance
of the nominal exchange rate at horizons 12 to 48 months. On the other hand, transitory
monetary shocks are found to play an insignificant role. Finally, we find that real exchange
rates are driven primarily by real permanent disturbances with a negligible contribution of
monetary shocks.
This paper is related to a large literature on the dynamic effects of monetary shocks on
exchange rates. As mentioned above the main theoretical contribution in this area of research
is Dornbusch (1976), which uncovered the now well-known overshooting result. Eichenbaum
and Evans (1995) represent the first attempt to empirically test the overshooting hypothesis.
That paper produced three main findings. First, it is the first study to document what is
now known as delayed overshooting. Second, it found that uncovered interest rate parity
conditional on a monetary policy shock, which is a key assumption of the Dornbusch model,
is not borne out in the data. Third, it presents evidence that monetary disturbances account
for a large share of movements in exchange rates.
Kim and Roubini (2000) adopt a structural approach to the identification of monetary
policy shocks (as opposed to the recursive approach employed in Eichenbaum and Evans)
and find immediate exchange rate overshooting and no significant deviations from uncovered

3

interest rate parity. Faust and Rogers (2003) quarrel with the identification schemes of
Eichenbaum and Evans and Kim and Roubini, namely, the assumption that the foreign
interest rate fails to respond within the month to a U.S. monetary policy shock. Using
plausible alternative identification assumptions, including impact sign restrictions on the
impulse responses of inflation and the interest rate, Faust and Rogers cast doubt on the
robustness of the delayed nature of the exchange rate overshooting result as well as on the
importance of monetary shocks for exchange rate movements. They confirm, however, the
conditional breakdown of uncovered interest rate parity reported in Eichenbaum and Evans.
Scholl and Uhlig (2008) adopt an identification scheme based on multi-period sign restrictions (as opposed to impact sign restrictions as in Faust and Rogers). Specifically, they
assume that in response to a monetary tightening inflation cannot increase and the policy
rate cannot fall for an entire year. They find that under these identification assumptions a
tightening causes delayed overshooting, thus restoring the original results of Eichenbaum and
Evans. Kim, Moon, and Velasco (2017), using a sign restriction identification strategy like
the one adopted in Scholl and Uhlig, report that the delayed overshooting result is sensitive
to the choice of sample period. Specifically, their results suggest that, although overshooting
is robust to sub-sampling, delayed overshooting is limited to the Volcker era.
There also exist papers that study the behavior of exchange rates in response to monetary
policy shocks identified using the Romer and Romer narrative approach (see Eichenbaum
and Evans (1995, especially figure IV) and Hettig, Müller, and Wolf (2018) ). The latter
study emphasizes that the exchange rate overshooting result, immediate or delayed, is not
robust to this type of identification scheme. The present paper departs from the literature
surveyed in this and the previous paragraphs in that it distinguishes between temporary
and permanent monetary disturbances. To the best of our knowledge it represents the first
attempt to implement this distinction in the context of an international empirical model and
to document that it has significant consequences for the dynamics of exchange rates and
excess returns.

4

More broadly, the present paper is also related to Engel (2016), who estimates a vector
error correction system in the nominal exchange rate, the cross country price-level differential,
and the nominal interest-rate differential and extracts the permanent component of the
nominal exchange rate. Our empirical analysis differs from Engel’s both in its formulation
and focus. First, Engel’s analysis focuses on the unconditional correlation of foreign-exchange
risk premia and real interest-rate differentials, whereas the present study is concerned with
the effects of temporary and permanent monetary shocks on exchange rates and uncovered
interest differentials. Second, the error-correction model of Engel’s imposes stationarity in
the level of the real exchange rate and the nominal interest rate differential, whereas the
formulation in the present paper allows for the possibility that both of these variables have
a permanent component.
The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical model
and the identification scheme. Section 3 explains the estimation procedure. Section 4 describes the data used for estimation and their sources. Section 5 presents the main finding
of the paper, namely, the responses of exchange rates and interest rate differentials to permanent and transitory monetary shocks. Section 6 documents the importance of permanent
monetary shocks as drivers of nominal exchange rates. Section 7 estimates a variant of the
model in which monetary policy in the United States and the United Kingdom are assumed
to share a common permanent component. Section 8 shows that the main results of the
paper are robust to restricting the sample to the Volcker era. Section 9 concludes.

The Empirical Model

The empirical model adapts the closed-economy model of temporary and permanent monetary shocks developed in Uribe (2018) to allow for a foreign block. The model is cast in
five variables: the logarithm of real domestic output, denoted yt , domestic inflation, denoted
πt, the domestic nominal interest rate, denoted it, the foreign interest rate, denoted i∗t , and

5

the depreciation rate of the domestic currency, denoted t ≡ ln(St /St−1 ), where St denotes
the spot nominal exchange rate, defined as the price of one unit of foreign currency in terms
of units of domestic currency in period t. The variables πt, it , i∗t , and t are expressed in
percent per year. The domestic economy is meant to be the United States, and the foreign
economy is meant to be either the United Kingdom or Japan.
All five variables are assumed to be nonstationary. We assume that output is cointegrated
with an exogenous variable Xt , which can be interpreted as a stochastic output trend. In
addition, we assume that the domestic and foreign nominal interest rates are cointegrated,
respectively, with exogenous variables Xtm and Xtm∗ , which we interpret as permanent domestic and foreign monetary shocks. Finally, we assume that the variable t + πt∗ − πt, which
captures the change in the bilateral real exchange rate, is stationary. We then define the
following vector of stationary variables

where νti ∼ i.i.d. N (0, 1) for i = 1, . . . , 5 and ρ and ψ are 5 × 5 diagonal matrices of

In sum, the vector of stationary endogenous variables ŷt, π̂t , ît, ˆt , and î∗t follows an
autoregressive process driven by innovations in the growth rate of the domestic output trend,
∆Xt , innovations in changes in the permanent components of domestic and foreign monetary
policy, ∆Xtm and ∆Xtm∗ , stationary domestic monetary shocks, ztm , and other stationary
shocks, zt .
The system (1)-(2) is unobservable, because neither the detrended endogenous variables
nor the driving forces are observed. Thus, we think of that system as describing the evolution
of state variables in a state-space representation. To be able to estimate the model, we add
equations linking the unobservable variables to variables with an empirical counterpart.
Specifically, we include as observable variables the growth rate of real output, ∆yt , the
domestic interest-rate inflation differential, rt ≡ it − πt , the changes in the domestic and
foreign nominal interest rates, ∆it and ∆i∗t , and the change in the nominal depreciation
rate, ∆t. These variables are linked to the unobservable states as follows:

∆yt = ŷt − ŷt−1 + ∆Xt

7

rt = ît − π̂t
∆it = ît − ît−1 + ∆Xtm
∆t = ˆt − ˆt−1 + ∆Xtm − ∆Xtm∗
and
∆i∗t = î∗t − î∗t−1 + ∆Xtm∗ .
We assume that the variables on the left-hand sides of these expressions are observed with
measurement error. Specifically, we assume that the econometrician observes the vector ot
defined as

where µt is a 5 × 1 vector of measurement errors distributed i.i.d. N (∅, R), and R is a 5 × 5

2.1

Identification

We have already introduced model restrictions that allow for the identification of the permanent sources of uncertainty. Specifically, the assumptions that yt is cointegrated with Xt ,
that it , and πt are cointegrated with Xtm , that i∗t is cointegrated with Xtm∗ , and that t is
cointegrated with Xtm − Xtm∗ , allow for the identification of the three permanent shocks. In
addition, we introduce restrictions that allow us to identify the transitory domestic monetary
shock. In the spirit of the sign restriction approach pioneered by Uhlig (2005), we assume
that increases in the domestic nominal interest rate caused by temporary innovations in
domestic monetary policy have nonpositive impact effects on inflation or output. Formally,

8

we impose the following sign restrictions on the coefficients of the matrix C in equation (1):

C12 ≤ 0

and

C22 ≤ 0.

These assumptions are less restrictive than the ones often imposed in models in which the
monetary shock is identified recursively. For example, Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) impose the restriction that output and inflation
cannot respond contemporaneously to a monetary policy shock, which in the context of the
present formulation is equivalent to imposing C12 = C22 = 0.
Without loss of generality, we normalize the impact effect of a unit innovation in the
transitory monetary shock, ztm , on the domestic nominal interest rate to unity. Similarly,
we normalize the impact effect of a unit innovation in the transitory shock, zt, on domestic
output to unity. Thus, we set
C32 = C14 = 1.
In line with the discussion in Faust and Rogers (2003), we leave unconstrained the contemporaneous response of the foreign interest rate to U.S. monetary policy, C51 and C52,
thus allowing the foreign monetary authority to respond within the month to U.S. monetary
policy shocks. Similarly, we leave unconstrained the contemporaneous response of the U.S.
interest rate to foreign monetary shocks, C35 .

Then we can write the system (1)-(3) as

ot = H 0 ξt + µt ,

(5)

and

where the matrices F , P , and H are known functions of the matrices Bi for i = 1, . . . , L, C, ρ,
and ψ and are shown in appendix A. This representation is of particular use for calculating
the likelihood of the data {o1 o2 . . . oT }, where T is the number of observations, via the
Kalman filter.
We estimate the model at a monthly frequency using Bayesian techniques. The specification includes 6 lags in equation (1), L = 6. In assigning priors to the estimated parameters,
we follow Uribe (2018). Table 1 describes the assumed prior distributions of the estimated
parameters. We impose normal prior distributions to all elements of Bi , for i = 1, . . . , L. We

assume a prior parameterization in which at the mean of the prior parameter distribution
the elements of Ŷt follow univariate autoregressive processes. So when evaluated at their
prior mean, only the main diagonal of B1 takes nonzero values and all other elements of Bi
for i = 1, . . . , L are nil. We impose an autoregressive coefficient of 0.95 in all equations,
so that all elements along the main diagonal of B1 take a prior mean of 0.95. We assign a
prior standard deviation of 0.5 to the diagonal elements of B1 , which implies a coefficient
of variation close to one half (0.5/0.95). We impose lower prior standard deviations on all
other elements of the matrices Bi for i = 1, . . . , L, and set them to 0.25.
All elements of the matrix C are assumed to have normal prior distributions with mean
zero and unit standard deviation, with the following exceptions: First, as mentioned earlier,
C32 and C14 are normalized to one, and are therefore not estimated. Second, elements C21
and C31, which govern the responses of π̂t ≡ πt − Xtm and ît ≡ it − Xtm , respectively, to an
innovation in ∆Xtm , are assumed to have a prior mean of -1. This means that a shock that
increases the U.S. nominal rate in the long run by 1 percentage point, under the prior, has
a zero impact effect on inflation and the nominal rate. Third, we assume that C55 has a
prior mean of -1. This implies that a shock that increases the foreign nominal interest rate
11

in the long run by 1 percentage point has a prior mean impact effect on the foreign nominal
interest rate of zero. Fourth, we assume that the prior distributions of −C12 and −C22
have a positive support. This guarantees, in accordance with our identification assumptions,
that transitory increases in the nominal interest rate are limited to have nonpositive impact
effects on inflation and output. We assume Gamma distributions with mean and standard
deviation equal to 1 for both of these parameters. Thus, as in Uribe (2018), identification of
the domestic transitory monetary shock is achieved via restrictions on prior distributions.
The parameters ψii , for i = 1, . . . , 5, representing the standard deviations of the five
exogenous innovations in the AR(1) process (2) are all assigned Gamma prior distributions
with mean and standard deviation equal to one. We impose nonnegative serial correlations
on the exogenous shocks (ρii ∈ (0, 1) for i = 1, . . . , 5), and adopt Beta prior distributions for
these parameters. We assume relatively small means of 0.3 for the prior serial correlations
of the three monetary shocks (ztm , ∆Xtm , and ∆Xtm∗ ) and the nonmonetary nonstationary
shock (∆Xt ) and a relatively high mean of 0.7 for the stationary nonmonetary shock (zt).
The prior distributions of all serial correlations are assumed to have a standard deviation
of 0.2. The variances of all measurement errors, Rii , are assumed to have a uniform prior
distribution with lower bound 0 and upper bound of 10 percent of the sample variance of the
corresponding observable indicator. Although not explicitly discussed thus far, the estimated
model includes constants. These constants appear in the observation equation (5), for details
see Appendix A. The unconditional means of the five observables are assumed to have normal
prior distributions with means equal to their sample means and standard deviations equal
to their sample standard deviations divided by the square root of the length of the sample
period.
To draw from the posterior distribution of the estimated parameters, we apply the
Metropolis-Hastings sampler. We construct a Monte-Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) of two
million draws and burn the initial one million draws. Posterior means and error bands around
the impulse responses shown in later sections are constructed from a random subsample of

12

the MCMC chain of length 100 thousand with replacement.

The Data

The estimation uses monthly data from 1974:1 to 2018:3. The domestic country is meant
to be the United States and the foreign country the United Kingdom or Japan. We proxy
real domestic output, yt , by the log of an index of industrial production for the United
States. The source is OECD MEI database Production of Total Industry, seasonally adjusted,
index 2010=100, downloaded from stats.oecd.org on June 1, 2018. Domestic inflation, πt,
is proxied by the growth rate of the U.S. consumer price index. The source is OECD MEI
dataset Consumer Price Index, all items, index 2010=100, downloaded from stats.oecd.org
on June 1, 2018. The domestic nominal interest rate, it , is proxied by the U.S. federal
funds rate (monthly averages of daily rates). The source is the file frb H15.xls available at
www.federalreserve.gov, downloaded on June 2, 2018.
When the foreign economy is taken to be the United Kingdom the data used for estimation
are as follows: The devaluation rate, t , is measured by the growth rate of the dollar-pound
nominal exchange rate (dollar price of one British pound). The source is fred.stlouisfed.org
series EXUSUK, downloaded on June 1, 2018. The foreign nominal interest rate, i∗t , is
measured as the Official Bank Rate of the Bank of England obtained as follows. From
January 1975 to March 2018, the source is www.bankofengland.co.uk, and the series name
is IUMABEDR, downloaded on June 1, 2018. For the period January 1974 to December
1974, the source is fred.stlouisfed.org, and the series name is BOERUKM, retrieved on June
1, 2018. The estimation of the model that replaces the nominal exchange rate with the real
exchange rate uses the bilateral dollar-pound real exchange rate, defined as et ≡ Pt∗ St /Pt ,
where Pt∗ denotes the UK consumer price index in period t, Pt denotes the U.S. consumer
price index in period t, and St denotes the dollar-pound nominal exchange rate. The measure
for Pt∗ is Consumer Prices, All Items, index 2010=100, from the OECD Consumer Prices

13

(MEI) dataset, downloaded from stats.oecd.org on June 1, 2018.
When the foreign country is assumed to be Japan, the foreign nominal interest rate, i∗t ,
is proxied by the call rate, series IR01MADR1M. The source is www.stat-search.boj.or.jp
and the data were downloaded on June 4, 2018. The dollar-yen nominal exchange has the
same source and download date, and is given by the series FM08FXERM07. The foreign
price level, Pt∗ is proxied by the series Consumer Prices, All Items, index 2010=100, from the
OECD Consumer Prices (MEI) dataset, downloaded from stats.oecd.org on June 1, 2018.

Results

Figure 1 displays the impulse responses to temporary and permanent U.S. monetary shocks
when the foreign economy is taken to be the United Kingdom. The variables included in the
figure are the nominal U.S. interest rate, it, the nominal exchange rate (dollar price of one
British pound), ln St, the real dollar-pound exchange rate, ln et , and the uncovered interest
rate differential, it − i∗t − t+1. The left column of the figure displays impulse responses to a
permanent U.S. monetary shock (Xtm ) that increases the federal funds rate by 1 percentage
point in the long run. The right column displays impulse responses to a transitory U.S. monetary shock (ztm ) that increases the federal funds rate by 1 percentage point on impact. The
figure includes 95-percent confidence bands computed using the Sims-Zha (1999) method.
The main message conveyed by figure 1 is that the responses of the exchange rate and the
uncovered interest-rate differential are quite different depending on whether the monetary
shock is permanent or transitory.
A permanent increase in the nominal interest rate produces an immediate depreciation of
the nominal exchange rate, whereas a transitory increase in the nominal interest rate causes
a persistent appreciation.2 Importantly, the temporary monetary shock does not produce
overshooting of the exchange rate, as its response is weaker in the short run than at any point
2
By construction, the nominal exchange rate depreciates without bounds in the long run in response to
the permanent monetary shock. Thus, the noteworthy feature of the impulse response of ln St to a positive
innovation in Xtm is the predicted depreciation in the short run.

in the future. This finding is in contrast with the existing body of empirical studies that
have shown the existence of overshooting either immediately (Kim and Roubini, 2000; Faust
and Rogers, 2003; Kim, Moon, and Velasco, 2017), or in a delayed fashion (Eichenbaum and
Evans, 1995; Scholl and Uhlig, 2008). One possible interpretation of the difference between
the findings presented here and those just cited is that the overshooting effect found in models
that include a single monetary shock are the result of confounding impulses stemming from
transitory and permanent sources.
The results obtained for the nominal exchange rate extend to the real exchange rate, as
shown in the third row of figure 1. To compute these impulse responses we replace in equation (1) the stationary version of the nominal devaluation rate, b
t, by the real devaluation

rate, rt ≡ ln(et/et−1 ), thus imposing, in accordance with our maintained assumption, that

the real devaluation rate is stationary. The estimation is performed replacing ∆t by rt in
the vector of observables, which is justified by the assumption that the latter is stationary in
levels. As in the case of nominal exchange rates, the dollar-pound real exchange rate depreciates in response to a permanent increase in the U.S. nominal interest rate, but appreciates
in response to a transitory monetary tightening. Neither shock causes overshooting in the
sense that the initial response of the real exchange rate is larger than its long-run response.
Quantitatively the responses of the real and nominal exchange rates are similar when the
monetary shock is transitory but different when the shock is permanent. Specifically, when
the shock is permanent, the depreciation of the real exchange rate is much smaller than
that of the nominal exchange rate even in the short run (which is the relevant horizon for
this comparison). This suggests that, conditional on monetary shocks, the Mussa (1986)
Puzzle—the argument that nominal and real exchange rates move in tandem in the short
run—applies to transitory monetary shocks but not significantly to permanent monetary
shocks.
Consider now the response of the uncovered interest-rate differential, shown in the last
row of figure 1. In line with results documented extensively in the related empirical litera-

ture (see, for instance, the papers cited above), the bottom right panel of the figure shows
that a temporary increase in the nominal interest rate causes a deviation from uncovered
interest-rate parity (UIP) in favor of domestic assets. The novel result is that, contrary to
what happens under a temporary shock, a permanent increase in the nominal interest rate
causes a deviation from UIP against domestic assets. This finding suggests that deviations
from uncovered interest rate parity caused by monetary shocks might carry more risk than
previously thought, unless investors have the ability to tell apart permanent from transitory
monetary shocks as they take place.
Figure 2 displays the responses of domestic (that is, U.S.) inflation and output to the

17

U.S. monetary shocks, Xtm and ztm . Consistent with the vast existing literature on the effects
of transitory monetary policy shocks, see, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005), we find that a temporary tightening causes a contraction in aggregate activity and a
fall in inflation. In addition, in line with Uribe (2018), the left panels of figure 2 show that a
permanent increase in the nominal interest rate causes an immediate increase in inflation and
an expansion in aggregate activity. Thus, the neo-Fisher effect, whereby a monetary policy
shock that raises the nominal interest rate in the long run causes an increase in inflation
already in the short run, appears to be present not only at a quarterly frequency as in the
work of Uribe (2018) but also at a monthly frequency.
It is of interest to ascertain the behavior of the permanent component of U.S. monetary
policy as viewed through the lens of the empirical model. Figure 3 displays with a solid
line the estimate of the permanent U.S. monetary shock, Xtm , and with a broken line the
actual U.S. inflation rate, πt . A constant was added to the former to ensure that its sample
mean is equal to that of πt. Because the data is monthly the path of πt is quite jaggy.
Nonetheless it is discernible from the figure that the permanent monetary component, Xtm ,
tracks well low frequency movements in inflation. In particular, Xtm increases during the
high inflation years of the late 1970s and falls gradually during the Volcker disinflation of
the early 1980s. Also as reported in Uribe (2018) the estimation suggests the presence of a
significant permanent component in both the low inflation following the great contraction of
2008 and the increase in inflation that started when the Fed decided to embark on a gradual
normalization of interest rates in late 2015.
The results obtained when the foreign country is taken to be the United Kingdom continue
to hold when the foreign country is assumed to be Japan. This is shown in Figure 4. In
particular, a permanent increase in the U.S. policy rate causes a depreciation of the dollar
vis-á-vis the Japanese yen already in the short run and a deviation from UIP in favor of
Japanese assets, whereas the opposite results obtain when the monetary tightening in the
United States is temporary. Importantly, neither the nominal nor the real exchange rate

output are also broadly in line with the results reported when the model is estimated on U.S.
and U.K. data, that is, a temporary monetary tightening has the conventional contractionary
effect on real activity and prices, whereas a permanent tightening is associated with neo
Fisherian dynamics.

The Importance of Permanent Monetary Shocks for
Exchange Rates: Variance Decompositions

Thus far, we have argued that permanent monetary shocks are important for explaining
movements in the exchange rate on the basis that this variable responds quite differently
depending on whether the monetary disturbance is permanent or transitory. This argument
would be of limited relevance if permanent shocks had a minor role in driving exchange
rates at business-cycle frequencies. To shed light on this issue, table 2 reports forecasterror variance decompositions of the nominal and real dollar-pound and dollar-yen exchange
rates, the uncovered interest-rate differential, U.S. output growth, U.S. inflation, and the
U.S., U.K., and Japanese policy rates at horizon 36 months. The choice of horizon follows
Eichenbaum and Evans (1995).
The picture that emerges from the table is that permanent monetary shocks are the main
drivers of the nominal exchange rate. Jointly, the domestic and foreign permanent monetary

22

shocks, Xtm and Xtm∗ , explain 95 and 62 percent of the forecast-error variance of the dollarpound and dollar-yen nominal exchange rates, respectively. The domestic (U.S.) permanent
monetary shock plays a significant role, explaining 37 and 50 percent of this variance for the
dollar-pound and dollar-yen nominal exchange rates, respectively.
Further, independently of whether the foreign block is taken to be the United Kingdom
or Japan, the domestic permanent monetary shock is estimated to be an important driver
of domestic nominal variables. It accounts for the majority of the forecast-error variance of
U.S. inflation, 82 to 84 percent, and for a significant fraction of the variance of the federal
funds rate, 35 to 57 percent. The domestic permanent monetary shock also explains a
nonnegligible fraction of the forecast-error variance of domestic real output growth, 10 to
26 percent. These last three findings are similar to those obtained by Uribe (2018) in the
context of closed-economy empirical and optimizing models estimated on U.S. and Japanese
quarterly data.
By contrast, the domestic monetary shock, ztm , plays a negligible role in accounting
for short-run movements in the nominal exchange rate. Table 2 shows that ztm explains
no more than one percent of the forecast-error variance of the dollar-pound or dollar-yen
nominal exchange rate. This share is much smaller than the one reported in other studies.
For example, Eichenbaum and Evans (1995) estimate that their identified monetary shock
explains, respectively, 19 and 22 percent of the forecast-error variance of the dollar-pound
and dollar-yen nominal exchange rates at horizons 31 to 36 months.3 One possible source
of discrepancy could be that their estimation does not distinguish between temporary and
permanent monetary disturbances.
Unlike the nominal exchange rate, the real exchange rate is estimated to be driven primarily by real shocks. Table 2 shows that taken together, the three monetary shocks explain
less than 10 percent of movements in ln et . Of the two real shocks, the permanent one, Xt ,
accounts for the lion share of movements in the real exchange rate, with a share of 71 per3

These point estimates, however, are reported to be statistically insignificant at a 10-percent confidence
level (see their table Ib).

23

cent in the United Kingdom and 98 percent in Japan. The modest role of monetary shocks
in accounting for movements in the real exchange rate is consistent with that reported in
Clarida and Galı́ (1994). For the United Kingdom, these authors find that monetary shocks
explain 0.4 percent of the forecast-error variance of the level of the real exchange rate at a
horizon of 12 quarters. For Japan at the same forecasting horizon, they estimate a larger
contribution of 15 percent, but with a standard error of 13 percent, reflecting significant
sampling uncertainty.
The main result of this section, namely, that permanent monetary shocks play an important role in explaining the variance of forecast errors of the nominal exchange rate, continues
to hold at other horizons relevant for business-cycle analysis. Tables B.1 and B.2 of appendix
B show results for horizons 12 to 48 months for the United Kingdom and Japan, respectively.
As expected, permanent monetary shocks continue to be important at horizons longer than
36 months. The noteworthy result is that even at a horizon as short as 12 months, permanent monetary shocks explain 49 and 46 percent of the forecast-error variance of the nominal
exchange rate in the United Kingdom and Japan, respectively.
In sum, this section documents that permanent monetary shocks represent an important
source of short-run variation in nominal exchange rates. At the same time, permanent real
shocks emerge as the main driver of movements in the real exchange rate.

Cointegrated Monetary Policies

Arguably, monetary policy could be coordinated across countries. For example, it is conceivable that an economy smaller than but similar in degree of development and institutional
structure and related through trade in goods and financial assets to the United States might
follow an interest rate policy with a permanent component that keeps pace with that of its
larger partner. Figure 6 displays the nominal interest rate in the United States, the United
Kingdom, and Japan over the sample period 1974:1 to 2018:3. It is apparent from the fig-

ure that the changes in the deviations of the U.K. bank rate from the federal funds rate
are quite transitory, suggesting that the two policy rates might share a common permanent
component. Such relationship is less apparent in the case of Japan, especially since 1995
when the Bank of Japan embarked in a zero-rate policy from which it has not yet emerged.
The conjecture that the U.S. and U.K. policy rates share a common permanent component,
but the U.S. and Japanese pair does not, is supported by standard unit-root tests performed
on the interest-rate differential it − i∗t .4
Accordingly, we now formulate a variant of the empirical model that assumes that it and
i∗t are cointegrated but can exhibit short-run deviations from each other, and then estimate
the new model on the dollar-pound dataset. In the new model, equation (1) is unchanged.
In equation (2), the fifth row now features the variable Xtm − Xtm∗ in lieu of ∆Xtm∗ , to yield

Figure 7 displays impulse responses to permanent and transitory monetary shocks in the
model with cointegrated policies. By construction, the response of the level of the nominal
exchange rate to a permanent U.S. tightening is now bounded, since the devaluation rate
is stationary. By and large, the results obtained under the baseline model carry over to
the new specification. In particular, (a) the nominal exchange rate depreciates in response
to a permanent tightening and appreciates in response to transitory tightening. The same

The Volcker Era and Exchange Rate Overshooting

An open question in the existing empirical literature on the effect of monetary policy on
exchange rates is whether in response to an interest-rate tightening the nominal exchange
rate exhibits a delayed or an immediate overshooting effect. Kim, Moon, and Velasco (2017)

29

argue that the delayed overshooting effect is a feature of the Volcker era. In this paper,
we argue that once one allows for both transitory and permanent monetary shocks, the
overshooting effect, either immediate or delayed, disappears altogether. In this section, we
show that this result is robust to truncating the sample in December of 1987, the last year
of Volcker’s chairmanship.
Figure 8 displays the responses of the dollar-pound and dollar-yen nominal exchange
rates to permanent and transitory increases in the federal funds rate when the model is
estimated on the shorter sample. Naturally, due to the reduced estimation period, the
impulse responses are estimated with significant sampling uncertainty, which is reflected in
wide error bands. Nonetheless, the main result conveyed by the figure is the absence of the
overshooting effect whether of a delayed or instantaneous type. A potential explanation of
this finding is that overshooting could be the consequence of not explicitly distinguishing
between temporary and permanent monetary disturbances.

Conclusion

Existing empirical studies have documented that a monetary shock that increases the domestic interest rate causes an appreciation of the domestic currency with an overshooting
effect, that is, an appreciation of the domestic currency that is larger in the short run than
in the long run and a persistent deviation from uncovered interest parity in favor of domestic
assets.
In this paper, we estimate an empirical model of exchange rates that allows for permanent and transitory monetary shocks. Using monthly data from the United States, the
United Kingdom, and Japan for the post Bretton-Woods period, we report three main findings. First, permanent monetary shocks explain the majority of short-run movements in the
nominal exchange rate, while transitory monetary shocks play a minor role. Real exchange
rates are driven primarily by permanent real shocks, with a negligible role for monetary

30

disturbances. Second, once permanent and transitory monetary shocks are modeled separately, the overshooting effect disappears: Transitory increases in the nominal interest rate
cause persistent appreciations of the domestic currency, whereas permanent increases cause
persistent depreciations. This finding suggests that the existing overshooting results may be
the consequence of confounding impulses. Third, both transitory and permanent increases in
the domestic nominal interest rate cause persistent deviations from uncovered interest-rate
parity, but of opposite signs, the former in favor of domestic assets and the latter against.
A pending issue in this line of investigation is to capture the effects of monetary policy
shocks on exchange rates documented in this paper in the context of an equilibrium optimizing model of nominal and real exchange rate determination. Certainly, a challenge that
such a theoretical endeavor will have to confront is to generate short-run deviations from
uncovered interest rate parity that are of opposite sign depending on whether the monetary
shock is transitory or permanent. This aspect of the propagation mechanism will most likely
prove crucial for explaining observed exchange rate dynamics. We leave these tasks for future
research.

The vector Ybt evolves over time according to
Ybt =

i=1

Bi Ybt−i + Cut

and the vector ut according to
ut = ρut−1 + ψνt.
Then to obtain a first-order state space representation let the vector ξt be given by

ξt ≡

With these definitions and notation in hand the empirical model becomes

ξt+1 = F ξt + P νt+1

and the observation equations can be written as

ot = A0 + H 0 ξt + µt .

The relationship between the matrices Bi for i = 1, . . . , L, C, ρ, and ψ and the matrices
A, F, P , and H is as follows. Let V denote the number of variables included in the vector Ybt

and S the number of shocks in the vector νt . In the empirical implementation of the model

V = 5 and S = 5. Further, let
B ≡ [B1 · · · BL ],
and let Ij denote an identity matrix of order j, ∅j denote a square matrix of order j with all
entries equal to zero, and ∅i,j denote a matrix of order i by j with all entries equal to zero.
Then, for L ≥ 2 we have
