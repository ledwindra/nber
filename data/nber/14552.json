    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper is an attempt to assess the existence and magnitude of local research spillovers in France. We rely on the model of an extended production function (Cobb-Douglas and Translog) with both local and neighborhood R&D capital stocks. We estimate this model on 312 employment areas as of 1999, first for the whole economy, then separately for five large manufacturing industries. The estimated elasticities of productivity with respect to R&D capital are significant and plausible, both within own-area and across neighboring areas as well as within own-industry, but they are weaker across different industries.\n\n",
    "acknowledgement": "\nWe have benefited from useful comments by participants to the ADRES conference on Network of Innovation and Spatial Analysis of Knowledge Diffusion (Saint Etienne, CREUSET, September 2006) and to various seminars where preliminary versions of this work have been presented. We are particularly grateful to Corinne Autant-Bernard and Nadine Massard for their patient encouragement.
