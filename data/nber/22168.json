    "abstract": "\n\nLittle is known about the relationship between family income and children\u2019s non-cognitive (or socio-emotional) skill formation.  This is an important gap, as these skills have been hypothesized to be a critical link between early outcomes and adult socioeconomic status.  This paper presents new evidence of the importance of family income in the formation and evolution of children\u2019s non-cognitive skills using a recent US panel dataset that tracks children between grades K-5.  Findings suggest an important divergence in non-cognitive skills based on family income that accumulates over time and does not seem to be explained by children\u2019s health status differences.\n\n",
