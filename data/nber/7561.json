    "abstract": "\n\nA rapidly growing literature examines the impact of immigrants on the labor market outcomes of native-born Americans.  However, the impact of immigration on natives in self-employment has not been examined, despite the over-representation of immigrants in that sector.   We first present a new general equilibrium model of self-employment and wage/salary work.  For a range of plausible parameter values, the model predicts small negative effects of immigration on native self-employment rates and earnings.  Using 1980 and 1990 Census microdata, we then examine the relationship between changes in immigration and native self-employment rates and earnings across 132 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States.  We find evidence supporting the hypothesis that self-employed immigrants displace self-employed natives.  The effects are much larger than those predicted by simulations of the theoretical model.  Immigrants, however, do not have a negative effect on native self-employment earnings.  Our findings are similar if we weight immigration rates by the propensity of immigrant groups to be self-employed or if we try alternative estimation techniques and specifications.\n\n",
