Vertical Networks and U.S. Auto Parts Exports: Is Japan Different?

ABSTRACT
This paper develops a model in which upstream network “insiders” conduct relationship specific
investment that induces the downstream firm to transact within networks. The scale of destinationcountry production and part-specific measures of the importance of network relationships and
engineering costs are used to explain the pattern of U.S. auto parts exports. Our results support the
prediction that large scale promotes relationship-specific investment and reduces imports. Also, while
Japan is a large parts importer, the composition of its imports is shifted away from parts where
vertical keiretsu are prominent. Nations hosting U.S.-owned automakers import more U.S. parts.

1 Introduction
Despite decades of tariff reductions and infrequent use of contingent protection, many observers continue to regard the Japanese market as “closed” to foreigners. In support of this
claim, they point to persistent trade surpluses and a relatively low import to GDP ratio (7%
in 1999). Since formal trade barriers seem too small to explain the alleged lack of market access, commentators point instead to special business practices. As noted by the World Trade
Organization’s 1998 Trade Policy Review, “Concern remains about the effects on foreign access
to Japan of horizontally and vertically integrated groups (kigyo-shudan and keiretsu).”
Keiretsu are well-known and controversial but not the only business networks with the
potential to influence international trade. Rauch’s (2001) recent survey discusses the tradecreating activities of networks comprising members of ethnic groups and affiliates of multinational corporations. Rauch describes how such networks promote trade by disseminating
information on market opportunities and the trustworthiness of potential trade partners.
An additional role seems relevant for vertical networks: the facilitation of investment by
upstream firms that generates benefits for downstream firms.
This paper investigates the role of business networks in trade by examining the pattern of U.S. auto parts exports to 26 countries from 1989 to 1994. We develop the model
of Spencer and Qiu (2001) that identifies vertical networks as arising from the decision of
suppliers to conduct relationship-specific investment. The theory contains implications for
trade by identifying the parts likely to be produced within the network and those likely to
be procured at arms-length from “outsiders.” We find evidence consistent with the model’s
proposition that a lager scale of local production reduces imports by encouraging local insiders to conduct relationship-specific investment. Our results indicate that Japan’s imports of
1

a part tend to be lower for parts where vertical keiretsu are prominent. On average, though,
Japan imports more parts from the U.S. than one would expect from its observed economic
characteristics. We also find higher imports by countries with a larger amount of production
by U.S. automobile affiliates—especially for parts with high engineering costs.
Our study contributes to the debate on whether Japan’s imports are “too low” and whether
vertical keiretsu are exclusionary. Lawrence (1993) cites studies showing that Japanese manufacturing imports are lower than the levels predicted by trade models. Moreover, Lawrence
(1991) finds that import penetration decreases in Japan with increases in the share of both
horizontal and vertical keiretsu sales across industries. Fung (1991) reports a negative relationship between U.S. exports to Japan and the combined share of horizontal and vertical
keiretsu sales. Saxonhouse (1993) identifies problems in the papers supporting the Lawrence
position and presents his own evidence showing that Japan’s distinctive trade structure can
be explained by its pattern of factor endowments.
Saxonhouse also points out that any import-reducing effects of keiretsu may to be due to
efficiency rather than collusion. The Spencer and Qiu (2001) model provides a theoretical
basis for networks as a vehicle for increasing efficiency. They argue that U.S. firms find
it difficult to sell intermediate goods in Japan because keiretsu suppliers make efficiencyenhancing investments in parts that strongly benefit from relationship-specific investment.
Miwa and Ramseyer (2000) review the theoretical and empirical work on the economic
role of relationship-specific investment and keiretsu in the automobile industry. Countering views to the contrary expressed by Asanuma (1989) and Aoki (1988), they argue that
relationship-specific investment and extra-contractual governance mechanisms do not appear to play important interrelated roles in Japan’s automobile industry. Further argu-

2

ments downplaying the role of relationship-specific investment are provided by CasadesusMasanell and Spulber (2000) who find that General Motor’s acquisition of Fisher Body was
not an effort to avoid opportunism in the presence of asset specific investment. However,
other research provides empirical evidence showing that U.S. automakers tend to internalize
the production of parts for which relationship-specific investment is important. Monteverde
and Teece (1982), the source of some of the data used in this study, find that the likelihood
that General Motors and Ford produce a part in-house is positively associated with the engineering costs of part development and a measure of model-specificity. Klier (1994) and Masten, Meehan, and Snyder (1989) also conclude that concerns about opportunism influence
the vertical integration decisions of U.S. automakers. We extend this literature by testing the
implications of our model linking the decision to conduct relationship-specific investment
to international trade.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 models how ex-post bargaining with an assembler affects the incentive of a parts supplier to make relationship-specific investments.
It predicts that network firms will only produce parts for which the marginal product of
relationship-specific investment exceeds a critical level with “outsiders” supplying the remaining parts. Section 3 describes our data set on U.S. exports of 53 different vehicle parts
to 26 importing countries over the period 1989 to 1994. We present and interpret the econometric results in section 4. Finally, section 5 summarizes the implications of these results for
our understanding business networks.

2 A Model of Vertical Networks
The model is an adaptation of Spencer and Qiu (2001).1 An automaker chooses between
purchasing parts from a member of its “network” or from independent firms. We will refer
to the former as “insiders” and the latter as “outsiders.”
Insider suppliers have an advantage because, based on long-term relationships, they can
make relationship-specific investments, referred to as RSI, so as to reduce the cost of assembly for the maker. This cost reduction applies only to the maker for which the part is
designed and not for other makers. Membership of the network is necessary for these investments because of the need for a very high level of information concerning not only the
design of the part itself, but also with the way the part can be modified to better fit with
other connecting parts in the assembly process.2 In addition to insiders, there are a large
number of potential outsider suppliers that can not undertake RSI for the maker and hence
are able to supply “generic” parts at competitive prices based on their cost of production
plus transport costs. Despite the advantage of RSI conducted by insiders, the maker may
nevertheless select outsiders because of their potentially lower cost of production.
For simplicity, we present the analysis for a representative maker with an exogenously
set output of cars, denoted . This will allow us to focus on the cost minimization problem associated with sourcing components without fully specifying the downstream product
market.3
A large number,  , of parts is required to produce an auto, with parts and labour com1

Qiu and Spencer (2002) also extend this model to examine the effects of trade policy aimed at opening the
Japanese market.

Branstetter (2000) finds strong empirical evidence for the importance of the flow of technological information within vertical keiretsu in enhancing efficiency.

Spencer and Qiu’s (2001) specification of the product market for cars as a Cournot duopoly with segmented
markets reveals that the main insights of the model are robust to relaxing the single assembler assumption.

bined in fixed proportion in final assembly. Each assembled auto requires  units of part .
For each part , there is a single insider supplier also referred to with subscript  that potentially makes a relationship-specific investment, denoted  . This investment creates a rent
for the maker in the form of a reduction in the assembly cost for each auto produced using
  

the part from supplier . Different parts have different potential for RSI. Letting 

denote a measure of the efficacy of RSI for part , we assume that the relationship between
the rent, denoted  , created per part used and the level of  is given by



 



(1)

This functional form implies that higher levels of RSI create more rent for the maker, but at
a decreasing rate.
We exploit the fact that  is large by ordering the parts on a continuum 

   , with

the parts varying from low to high values of RSI efficacy,  . We assume that  is strictly
increasing in  and hence   
¼

 for all 

   .

The magnitude of  —but not the

ranking of parts—may vary internationally so as to capture country-specific differences in
the efficacy of RSI. For example, if the nature of institutions and culture in Japan would
better facilitate the kind of information transfer that enhances RSI, then  would be larger
there.
Let

represent the constant unit cost of production of part  for insiders. Outsiders

supply a homogeneous version of the part in a competitive spot market at price
and

£

£

. Both

include all relevant transport costs to the maker’s facility (as well as tariffs if the part

5

is imported). We define Æ as the cost advantage of sourcing from an outsider:



Æ

£



Note that this cost advantage does not include the rent generated by RSI. We assume for
simplicity that Æ is constant across parts.4
Although parts can be produced more cheaply by outsiders, the maker can gain from
the local purchase of part  from an insider supplier due to the effect of RSI in reducing
assembly costs. Supposing that part  is purchased at a price,



, the rent,  , created

  . Consequently, it is possible that  

by RSI reduces the maker’s net cost to

£

,

reflecting an overall cost advantage to the maker from the use of insider-made parts. Since
represents the demand for each part ( units of each part are required per auto), the



resulting profit for insider supplier  is given by:



 



(2)

An important aspect of RSI is that the supplier cannot be guaranteed a return based on a
contract that is conditional on the amount,  , of investment. This is due to the difficulty of
actually observing  , which would include non-observable costs (or at least non-verifiable
by courts), such as the costs of obtaining the information and coordination with other suppliers. Consequently, we assume that the investment,  , is sunk prior to bargaining between
each supplier and the maker as to the price,

. The resulting price,

, can be based on  ,

but not on  .

Spencer and Qiu (2001) show that the theory can accommodate Æ ¼ ´ µ ¼ and small values of Æ ¼ ´
empirical specification could also accommodate Æ that varies across parts in the part fixed effects.

The

The order of moves is as follows: At stage 1, each supplier  commits to its investment


 , and simultaneously the maker specifies its output,

. Since each firm sets its choice

variable to maximize own profit taking the other choice variables as given, this gives rise
to a Nash equilibrium in  and . In making these decisions, the maker and its suppliers
correctly anticipate the outcome of the stage 2 bargaining process determining the prices, ,
for parts. We assume the maker will at least break even, but suppliers have to consider the
possibility that, if the agreed upon price is too low, RSI at stage 1 could result in a loss. At
stage 2, the maker engages in Nash bargaining over the price,

, simultaneously with each

remaining supplier. If an agreement is reached with the supplier of part , the maker orders
the 

parts needed to produce output . Otherwise, the maker buys the same quantity of

part  from an outsider firm.
The maker’s marginal cost due to part  is given by



if it reaches an agreement

in its bargaining with supplier . It has a ‘threat point’ of buying the part from outsiders
at a price of

£

if bargaining breaks down. Thus, the maker’s net payoff from reaching

agreement is given by 

£

    

, i.e. the difference between the price of outsiders and

the net cost of parts procured from insiders multiplied by the quantity of parts produced.
Correspondingly, since investment,  , is sunk by stage 2, supplier ’s surplus from reaching
an agreement is its variable profit, 

insider’s profit would be
bargaining power, i.e. 

And, since suppliers

would not do RSI without an expected profit, it is actually beneficial to the maker to have
less than complete bargaining power.
At stage 1, supplier  determines the optimal value of  in the event that it would produce the part by maximizing

as in (3), taking

Figure 1: The determination of which parts are sourced from insiders
Figure 1 illustrates the model. Parts 

    are ordered along the X-axis in terms of

increasing  . The upward sloping dashed curve representing  corresponds to the hypo9

thetical reduction in assembler costs if the supplier chose  according to equation (4). The
possible profit (or loss) of supplier  if it chooses to produce is shown by the solid line, denoted . For 

 Æ, profit is given by equation (3) which is increasing in . For 

Æ , the

supplier anticipates that bargaining will break down and it will suffer a loss equal to the
amount of RSI ( ). Since the lines denoting  and Æ (the horizontal dashed line) cross at


, the maker would prefer insiders for all parts 

the return for parts 

 . However, supplier ’s share of

    is not sufficient to cover the cost of RSI, with the outcome that

these parts are sourced from outsiders. Profit is zero (the

line cuts the X-axis) at part 

,

which is the lowest value of RSI importance at which insiders can expect to break even. Each
supplier  will commit to its RSI and choose to produce for 
inactive for 

  , but will set 

 and be

.

The implications of this model for trade depend on the locations of insiders and outsiders. The basic hypothesis used to develop the empirical specification is that insiders
include local parts suppliers producing in the same country as the automaker. In particular,
members of vertical keiretsu in Japan are viewed as insiders with respect to the production
of auto parts for makers in Japan, but there may also be local vertical networks in other
countries. This insider categorization is based on the logic that the information needed to
design a part for a particular car model requires geographic proximity between upstream
and downstream firms. However, we also consider the possibility that the coordination required for RSI can occur over longer distances if mediated by a multinational enterprise.
Thus a supplier in the U.S. might be an insider when it transacts with a U.S. multinational
firm operating a foreign market. Taking into account these two possibilities, the U.S. parts
producers that export to non-U.S. car makers located abroad would be outsiders in these

10

transactions. The empirical section will provide a test of the validity of these views of the
boundaries of networks.
Since, as currently specified, the model predicts either zero sourcing of part  from outsiders or exactly 

units, for the empirical specification, we adapt the model to reflect the

greater continuity in export levels that we observe in the trade data. This involves relaxing
our assumption of a representative maker so as to introduce heterogeneity across makers
within each country as to whether to use a local insider or an outsider as a source for each
part. Thus due to differences in characteristics, one maker might be using local insiders
for a given part , while another uses outsiders for the same part. Consequently each part
will have a probability of being sourced from a local insider, leading to non-zero import
probabilities for all parts.
We introduce this heterogeneity by assuming that the cost advantage for outsiders, Æ


£

£

, varies randomly across the makers in each country. Since , the costs of insiders, and

, the delivered price charged by outsiders, are both likely to vary across countries, we add

 subscripts to identify the location of production. To determine the effect of variation in
Æ on the value of parts imported by country  , we first derive the probability, denoted

that a maker in country  sources part  from a local insider. From our model,
probability that Æ is small enough to set



 . Using the expression for

and   now have  subscripts to reflect cross-country variation in output per maker

and the efficacy of RSI.
The next step is to assume that Æ is drawn from the Pareto distribution with scale pa11

rameter  and shape parameter   . Thus, the expected value of Æ , given by  

 ,

varies across countries but not across parts. The cumulative density function for a Pareto
random variable is given by  

   , where  is the minimum value. The use of


the Pareto distribution allows us to express the probability of selecting a local insider in the
following multiplicative form:

As can be seen from (9), the probability of using a local insider is a continuous function of
the parameters, .
Since our data involves the value of U.S. exports of auto parts, we let



represent the

probability that a maker in country  imports part  from the United States conditional on
not purchasing the part from a local insider. The overall probability that country  imports

3 Data
Grouping the data into four categories—exports, car production, measures of the efficacy
of relationship-specific investment and finally, concordance and description of parts,—we
document the sources and measurement of the variables used in this study.

3.1 Export Data
We downloaded highly disaggregated U.S. export data from the Center for International
Data maintained by Robert Feenstra at the University of California Davis. These data measure the fob value of parts exports, cover the 1989 to 1994 period, and are classified according
to the Harmonized System (HS). We searched the HS descriptions to locate every ten-digit
HS commodity category that involves automobile parts to obtain as complete a sample of exports as possible. Whenever possible, we confined the sample to parts specifically intended
for passenger cars. In some cases even the most disaggregated HS codes do not distinguish
between types of motor vehicles. A complete list of the HS codes that comprise our sample
13

and their descriptions is available from the authors.

3.2 Car Production
Letting  denote the number of makers in country j, our model requires passenger car
production,  , and output per maker,



   , by country. We estimate 






based on a

measure of the number of equal-sized makers as generated by the inverse of a Herfindahl
index for each country. The Herfindahl index for country j, denoted  , is derived from
output data for each maker in country  . Since we consider the possibility that U.S. parts
exporters may be insiders in business relations with the foreign affiliates of U.S. makers, we
also require the share of passenger car production by country accounted for by subsidiaries
of the big three U.S.-based makers at that time (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler). We refer
to this measure as BIG 3. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States
provides annual car production data for 26 countries. We restrict our sample to that set of
export markets. The same publication also provides the annual number of cars produced by
each maker in each country, including production by the overseas subsidiaries of General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
Table 1 lists the 26 countries with passenger car production together with an isocode
used to identify each country. Column (1) shows the average number of individual parts
imported by each of these countries across the six years of our sample. This average has an
upper bound of the number of parts, which is 53. In the data, the average ranges from 7.8
to 52.5 with more than half of the countries importing on average at least 40 different parts
each year. Column (2) lists each country’s share of U.S. exports (to the 26 countries) and
column (3) then provides each country’s share of world car production outside the United

Share of Non−US Car Production

Figure 2: Car Production Shares and Shares of US Parts Exports
States. Column (4) reports

BIG 3.

As the column shows, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler

produce cars in ten of the countries according to our data. Column (5) shows the number
of makers, given by 

  . Our measure of local scale (in 1000s of cars per maker),




,

appears in column (6).
The relationship between each country’s share of car parts exports from the U.S. and its
share of non-U.S. car production (from columns (2) and (3) respectively of Table 1) is shown
in Figure 2. If each country imported U.S. parts in the same fixed proportion to output then
the points would line up on the 45-degree line. We code each country into three categories of
BIG 3,

namely “No Big 3 Production”, “Minority Big 3” (less that 50% of output produced by

Ford, GM, and Chrysler affiliates) and “Majority Big 3.” Canada and Mexico are well above
the 45-degree line, and therefore have import shares much greater than production shares.
On the other hand, the former communist nations, the C.I.S. (ru), Czech Republic (cz), China
16

(cn), Hungary (hu), and Yugoslavia (yu) import less than their car production share of U.S.
parts. Japan also lies below the 45-degree line.

3.3 Determinants of the efficacy of RSI
Our formal theory does not specify the criteria determining which parts have high efficacy
of RSI. One hypothesis is that vertical networks form to produce parts that have certain
technical characteristics associated with a greater need for RSI. This group would include
parts, such as engines, which involve costly investments in engineering and design that
are relevant mainly to a particular automaker. We implement this idea by using a rating
of the cost of engineering per part developed by Monteverde and Teece (1982) on the basis of information provided by a design engineer. This engineering cost rating, which we
refer to as

ECR,

rates the engineering cost of developing a given part for a new car model

on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 corresponding to the highest level. To the extent that these engineering costs are specific to a maker, they would represent relationship-specific investments
and hence

ECR

can serve as a proxy for the efficacy of RSI. There are no doubt other pos-

sible technical characteristics that enhance the potential for RSI for a particular part. For
example, relationship-specific investments could be important for achieving “just-in-time”
delivery, with the nature and extent of these investments varying over parts due to differing
requirements for packaging and transport. Since the Japanese auto producers were pioneers
in developing just-in time delivery, this type of RSI could be relatively more important for
Japan. We do not consider this possibility due to lack of data. Spencer and Qiu (2001) propose a further possibility (also not considered) that a higher efficacy of RSI is associated with
parts that are more important part in the sense that they represent a greater share of the cost

17

of an auto.
A second hypothesis of particular relevance for our analysis of keiretsu in Japan is that
a greater strength of network involvement in the production of a part may itself raise the
efficacy of RSI for that part. Two features of vertical networks could be significant here.
First, as detailed in our model, the formation of a vertical network ameliorates the hold-up
problem and hence raises the incentives for suppliers to engage in RSI. Secondly, the effect
of vertical networks in increasing the flow of information between suppliers could suggest
new possibilities for relationship-specific investments and generally improve the efficiency
with which these investments are made. For any particular part, we hypothesize that the
strength of these effects will vary with the strength of network involvement as measured by
the degree to which producers of that part participate in the network. Taking this approach,
we can include the possibility that the group of parts produced with RSI in a vertical network may be determined by historical or cultural factors in a particular country, not just the
technical characteristics of parts. Thus, under this hypothesis, a vertical network such as
keiretsu, could potentially raise the efficacy of RSI for the parts they produce in Japan, but
these parts need not be the same as the parts produced by other vertical networks, such as in
the United States. Of course, there is also an alternative possibility, which we cannot address
with our data, namely that the vertical network is based on cronyism and does not generate
RSI. In this case, the preferential sourcing of parts from insiders would reduce rather than
raise the efficiency of production.
We develop three measures for the strength of network participation by part. Two of
these measures,

INH - U

and INH - J, measure the extent to which a part is produced in house

in the U.S. and Japan respectively and the third, KEI measures keiretsu involvement by part in

18

Japan. Monteverde and Teece (1982) provide estimates of the share of in-house sourcing for
each part by General Motors and Ford.

INH - U

is then a single measure (by part) of in-house

production shares in the U.S., generated by taking a weighted average of the Monteverde
and Teece (1982) measures in which GM has two-thirds weight so as to roughly reflect its
production volume.
Our measures,

INH - J

and

KEI,

are derived using data from The Structure of the Japanese

Auto Parts Industry, 1990, by Dodwell Marketing Consultants. This book lists the major
Japanese suppliers of individual auto parts for each automobile manufacturer in Japan.
It identifies whether the part is produced “in-house” and provides information as to the
“grouping” of each supplier. A supplier is considered to be in a particular maker’s group
based on the equity holdings of the maker, supplier reliance on the maker for 50% of its
sales, or other factors such as historical relationships or personnel ties. Following standard
terminology in the literature cited in the introduction, we refer to Dodwell’s “groupings” as
vertical keiretsu.
Defining a “link” as a unique pairing of a maker and a major supplier, we count the
respective numbers of links involving in-house production and keiretsu for a given maker
and part. Dividing by the total links for each maker, we then obtain the share of in-house
links and keiretsu links per maker. Finally, to generate INH - J and KEI as single measures per
part, we calculate the weighted average across makers of the shares of in-house links and
keiretsu respectively using car production in 1996 as the weight. Since the links that form the
basis of our measures involve only suppliers located in Japan, our measures do not depend
directly on the level of imports of each part.
Using the example of mufflers, which has a large keiretsu presence, Table 2 illustrates the

and KEI variables. The table sets out the main suppliers of mufflers

(as defined by Dodwell) for the makers (Toyota, Nissan etc) in Japan. We illustrate supply
links by in-house production with
an outsider with

.

, supply by a keiretsu member, with , and supply by

The first section lists the makers to show production in-house. For

the case of mufflers, Suzuki is the only maker to produce in-house. Since for Suzuki, there
are two other suppliers (Futaba and Sankei GK), its ratio of in-house links to total links is
1/3. Weighting by the fraction of output (8%) produced by Suzuki,

INH - J

(not shown) for

mufflers is 2.67%. The next group of suppliers, Sango to Hoei, represent firms that are part
of one of the makers’ keiretsu. However, it is interesting to note that some of these suppliers
also produce for makers outside their own keiretsu. Thus Futaba is part of the Toyota keiretsu,
but also produces for Honda, Mitsubishi and Suzuki. The final two suppliers, Comex and

20

Miyoshi, are outsiders that supply only Mazda. As can be seen from the table, there are only
two suppliers for Toyota (Sango and Futaba) and since they are both member of the Toyota
keiretsu, the number of keiretsu links relative to total links is 2/2 = 1. Weighting this fraction
by the share of output across the makers listed in the table (covering 92% of auto output),
we obtain KEI = 68.67/0.92 = 74.6%.5
We employ four proxies for the efficacy of relationship-specific investment. None of
these measures vary across time. Table 3 defines the variables and displays their correlations. Monteverde and Teece (1982) establish that the technical measure,

ECR,

is positively

related to GM and Ford’s decision to produce in house.6 We also observe this positive association in our correlations: the weighted sum of the Ford and GM in-house production
share, INH - U, has a significant and positive correlation with ECR. Interestingly, Japanese inhouse production as measured by

INH - J

has even stronger positive relationship with

ECR.

These correlations indicate that parts with high engineering cost ratings tend to be produced
in-house. In contrast, the table shows that our other measure of the strength of network participation, KEI, has virtually no correlation with ECR and a negative, but insignificant, correlation with INH - J and INH - U. If all four proxies are driven by the same underlying reason for
RSI, then they should all be positively correlated. Leaving aside problems of measurement,
this suggests that parts produced with high keiretsu involvement are not associated with
high costs of engineering. Keiretsu-produced parts may be associated with some other technical characteristics, such as those involved with just-in-time delivery, but it is also possible
that they mainly reflect the outcome of historical and cultural factors in Japan.
5

Accounting for links with the makers (Daihatsu, Fuji, Hino and Isuzu) not shown in the table, we obtain
= 72.4% for mufflers. For concordance with the trade data, we combine mufflers with exhaust pipes. Since
= 73.4% for exhaust pipes, we obtain KEI = 72.9% for the combined category.

3.4 Concordance and Description of Parts
The different sources have unique ways of categorizing parts. The export data is identified
according to the Harmonized System (HS), whereas the data from Dodwell (1990) and Monteverde and Teece (1982) reflect the categorization of the authors. We created a concordance
to combine the information from the difference sources. Based on an examination of the
data, we formed the 53 parts categories shown in Tables 4 and 5. These categories reflect
a level of aggregation equalling or exceeding the aggregation level in the various sources.
Thus, each of the part categories used in the different sources of data mapped to one of the
categories we devised. In cases where multiple part categories mapped to a single category
of ours, we summed the HS-level exports and averaged the RSI proxies.
Tables 4 and 5 portray some characteristics of the 53 parts. Column (1) shows the average number of countries that imported the part in the six years of our data. The column
probit regression analysis.

reveals that the majority of parts were shipped to most of the 26 countries that produce automobiles. The parts are ordered by their share of the value of U.S. parts exports, as shown
in column (2). Engines top the list at 15.4%, followed by transmissions (8.1%) then body
stampings (8.0%). Column (3) displays Japan’s share of U.S. parts exports for each part.
This column reveals high Japanese imports of catalytic converters (26.2%), tires (22.7%), and
starter motors (16.1%). In contrast, Japanese purchases account for less than 1.3% of engines,
transmissions, and body stampings exports from the United States. The last three columns
contain data on the share of in-house links in Japan (INH - J), keiretsu links in Japan (KEI) and
engineering cost ratings (ECR). Due to incomplete data for our measures of engineering cost
and network participation (indicated by blanks in the table), the regressions we estimate use
at most 50 parts categories.

into a fixed effect for each part in our regressions. If unique Japanese institutions raise the
efficacy of RSI for all parts, then ! is positive. The interaction term, ! , is positive if a greater
strength of network involvement in the production of a part is associated with an increase
in the Japanese advantage with respect to the efficacy of RSI. We interact

ECR

with

to

test whether the engineering cost rating is associated with a higher efficacy of RSI in Japan
as would be indicated by a positive value of ! . The combination of the signs of ! and !
could be of interest. In particular, if !   and !

Japanese networks independent of the technical characteristics of parts.
We now examine the elements of

trade costs associated with shipment to country  . In addition, car makers may find it easier
to meet U.S. safety and environmental standards if they obtain the relevant components
from U.S. based suppliers. Hence, we hypothesize that the propensity to import U.S. made
parts is increasing in the share of national car output exported to the U.S., as denoted by
X - US.7

We also include the possibility that U.S. parts exporters are insiders in business relations
with the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. makers. Since U.S. subsidiaries would then preferen7

A further implica-

tion of the theory is that these subsidiaries would import relatively more RSI-intensive parts.
We test this proposition by interacting

with

as well as

INH - U.

If insiders produce

RSI-intensive parts and if U.S. parts suppliers are insiders when trading with U.S. foreign
affiliates, then we expect these interaction terms to be positive. Taking all these factors into
account we obtain

gravity equations, we calculate the log of great-circle distance in miles between country  ’s
major city and the population centroid of the U.S. (Kansas City: latitude 40N, longitude
95W). We also include indicator variables for countries that are English-speaking (Australia,
Canada, and the United Kingdom), communist in 1989 (China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland, USSR/CIS, and Yugoslavia). We also add indicators for Canada and Mexico to
capture unique aspects such as trade arrangements (the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact and
maquiladora program launched by Mexico in the same year) and adjacency to the U.S. that
may explain their large volumes of imports as shown in Table 1. Finally we include the log of
per capita GDP (1989–94 World Bank data), another standard variable in gravity equations.

report the results in Table 6. All regressions include year-specific intercepts and we calculate

in column (1), this specification indicates that Japanese imports are “too low.” Column (2),
portraying results when we add local scale,



, and

BIG 3,

reveals that the negative Japan

effect is a consequence of failing to control for local scale effects which enter negatively and
significantly. Once we add scale, Japan tends to import more than the model predicts (significant at the 10% level). The & improves in this specification and the estimated distance
coefficient, perversely positive in column (1), now enters insignificantly. We also find that
a country’s imports of U.S. auto parts rises with the B IG 3 share of production. Columns
(3)–(6) in Table 6 show results when we add various interaction terms involving

BIG 3

and

JPN.

The result (from columns (2), (3), (5) and (6)) that Japan is a large importer of U.S. auto
parts does not support the hypothesis that Japanese institutions promote insider trade at the
expense of imports (from outsiders) for all parts. Japan’s larger than expected imports may
be explained by the fact that, relative to a number of the other countries which had high
tariffs and domestic content requirements, Japan has low formal trade barriers.9 Since tariffs
and other formal trade barriers are not used as controls in the model, it seems likely that
these omitted variables might help explain Japan’s high level of imports. Another possibility
is that Japan’s imports from the U.S. were unusually high due to pressure from the U.S.
government.10
Most of the coefficients of the trade cost variables are sensible and significant across the
specifications. Higher per capita income leads to higher parts imports. Per capita income
may capture differences in transportation infrastructure. English language contributes to

For example, starting in 1984, Australia introduced an 85% domestic content requirement for autos and
tariffs on autos ranged from 45% in 1988 to 30% in 1994. See Truett and Truett (1997).
10
In response to President George Bush’s trip to Japan in January 1992, Japanese automakers announced a
“voluntary” plan to double their 1990 purchases of U.S. auto parts by 1994. Actual purchases rose 30% from
1992 to 1993. See McMillan (1996).

trade, whereas communist countries import fewer parts. Once we control for local scale in
columns (2)–(6), the distance coefficient always has a positive sign but is not significantly
different from zero. In regressions without the Canada and Mexico indicator variables, the
estimated coefficient on distance is negative and significant. Exports to the U.S., X - US, are
associated with greater imports of U.S. auto parts, a result consistent with the proposition
that nations import U.S. auto parts partly in order to comply with U.S. technical regulations.
It is also the case that Canada and Mexico import significantly more than average. This
reflects a combination of geographic and trade policy factors.11
Column (3) displays results when we add

KEI JPN.

It enters negatively but is not sig-

nificant. These results indicate that Japan’s “greater than expected” level of imports may
not hold for parts with high levels of keiretsu participation. We add interactions using the
Monteverde and Teece measures of engineering cost ratings and U.S. in-house production
in column (4). None enter significantly. In column (5) we exclude the Monteverde and Teece
variables that limit our sample (they are only available for 40 of our parts categories) and
instead use

INH - J,

a variable we found to be strongly correlated with the engineering cost

rating. Again, no interactions terms are significantly different than zero.
Column (6) shows results utilizing the previous specification but estimated without the
parts category “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes”. From Table 4, “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” represents only 2% of the parts exported by the United States, but 13.9% of the parts imported by
Japan. This high level of imports may reflect the importance of U.S.-made exhaust systems
in ensuring that cars destined for the United States comply with U.S. emission standards.
Any such effect would not be fully captured by X - US, since it corrects only for the “aver11

autos and their parts due to the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact.

age” relationship between imports of parts and exports of cars to the United States. When
“Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” is excluded, we find that keiretsu participation has a negative and
significant impact on Japanese imports. The results do not indicate, however, that imports
of keiretsu-intensive parts are significantly lower in Japan than other counties. According to
Table 4, the second highest

 , multi-

plied by its value for KEI, 0.644, yields a small negative number -0.433.
The specification used in Table 6 has the advantage that information from 40-50 parts is
combined to obtain the estimates of the responsiveness of U.S. exports to import-country
characteristics. It imposes the restriction that the only differences in coefficients across parts
lie in the fixed effect and the interactions with JPN and BIG 3. This leads to efficient estimation
if the assumption holds. However, there are plausible reasons to believe that coefficients on
other variables might also vary across parts. For instance, as mentioned above, the import
sensitivity to X - US may vary across parts. In addition, differences in transportability should,
in all likelihood, lead to differences in distance and adjacency (Canada and Mexico) effects.
This could change our results of interest if there were, for instance, a correlation between
transportability and the proxies for the efficacy of RSI.
We investigate the robustness of our results by using the following two-step method that
relaxes restrictions on the estimated coefficients. In the first step, instead of stacking the
parts and estimating fixed effects, we estimate one equation per part. Thus all coefficients
(not just the intercept) are allowed to vary from part to part. Since there is no variation
in the RSI proxies for a given part, the interactions involving

JPN

and

coefficients have

different standard errors that we use as (inverse) weights to correct for heteroskedasticity in
the second step regressions.12
The intercepts of the second-step regressions correspond to the coefficients on

and

shown in Table 6 and the slope coefficients on NET and ECR correspond to coefficients

on the various interaction terms. To see this, note that the terms, % JPN 

the term inside the parentheses. The second-step regression of these estimated coefficients
on NET and ECR recovers % , % and % as the intercept and slope estimates.
We evaluate the part-specific regressions in step one by examining the mean across parts
of the estimated coefficients. In all cases, the mean value corresponds very closely to the
estimates shown in Table 6 although we observe variation across parts in the estimates.
Interestingly, we find evidence that the relationship between exports of “Mufflers+Exhaust
Pipes” and the explanatory variables differs dramatically from the rest of the sample. Specifically, the estimates for every coefficient for this part fall outside the 95% confidence interval
surrounding the mean of the estimates of the other part categories. As previously hypothesized, “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” exports are particularly sensitive to X - US.
Table 7 displays the results of second-step regressions that generate results corresponding to the five columns ((2)–(6)) of Table 6. For each column, the estimates are derived from
two second-step regressions using estimated coefficients for JPN and BIG 3 from the step-one
regressions. The summary statistics ( , & , and RMSE) for each regression appear at the

obtain the first-step standard errors.

5 Conclusion
We find evidence that networks do matter for trade and that Japan is different. Far from
being a “closed” market, Japan imports more auto parts from the U.S. than its observable
characteristics (car production, scale, distance from U.S., etc.) would predict. We find that
greater scale of host-country auto production deters parts imports, a result supporting the
model’s prediction that local scale increases the returns to relationship-specific investment.
Two results suggest that vertical networks matter for trade. First, U.S. exports to Japan
decrease as the importance of keiretsu sourcing of a part rises. Second, countries where the
Big 3 U.S. automakers account for large shares of car production tend to import more parts
from the United States.
A preference for insiders over outsiders results in our model from endogenous decisions by insiders to conduct relationship-specific investment. Insider networks may reflect
technical characteristics of parts that give rise to a high efficacy of RSI or may themselves
generate greater efficacy of RSI. In this context, rather than being exclusionary, networks
35

can be a source of greater efficiency in production. Our results are consistent with this view
of networks but further evidence would be required to reject the hypothesis that particular networks, such as keiretsu in Japan, reflect cronyism. Since vertical keiretsu links are not
correlated with engineering cost ratings, they do not appear to reflect technical efficiency,
at least as far as we can measure it. Thus, the economic basis for cross-part variation in the
prominence of keiretsu remains a puzzle that merits further investigation.
