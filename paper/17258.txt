ABSTRACT
This paper applies a probit estimation to assess the relationship between economic takeoffs during
1950-2000 and inflows of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI, controlling for country’s stock
of short-term external debt and commodity terms of trade. Average level of FDI inflows is associated
with a 23 percent higher takeoff probability relative to a zero FDI inflow benchmark, and this effect
is highest for the Latin America subsample, with a 65 rise in takeoff probability. Higher stock of short
term external debt has been associated with a substantial negative effect on the probability of a takeoff,
and the effect of the short terms debt overhang is largest for Latin American countries. Yet, virtually
all the takeoffs were associated with a rise in portfolio debt inflows. At the sample mean, inflow of
portfolio debt is associated with approximately 25 percent higher probability of a takeoff. In contrast,
a one standard deviation increase in equity outflows (inflows) is associated with a 47 percent (17 percent)
decline in the probability of a takeoff. A one standard deviation improvement in commodity terms
of trade is associated with 28 percent higher takeoff probability.

Introduction
The large swings of financial flows between the OECD and emerging countries in the 2000s, and

the growth turbulences associated with the financial crisis of 2008-9 put to the forefront the association
between growth takeoffs and the revealed patterns of financial integration. The renewed post-crisis large
inflows of hot money to emerging and developing countries focused attention on the degree to which
these flows would affect down the road the growth prospects of developing countries. For instance,
Canuto (2010) describes various dangers from asset price overshooting caused by excessive foreign
investor demand for emerging markets’ stocks, bonds, real estate, and other financial assets.
Furthermore, the heightened volatility of commodity prices renewed concerns about the greater exposure
of developing countries to adverse consequences of commodity terms of trade deterioration1, as a given
change in the relative prices of commodities tends to induce a much larger income effect in poorer
countries.
The growing global weight of emerging-market economics, and the growing gaps between nonemerging developing and the emerging market countries propagated significant literature on conditions
conducive to growth acceleration and economic takeoffs [see Hausmann, Pritchett, and Rodrik (2005) and
Aizenman and Spiegel (2010), and the references therein]. This paper focuses on narrow two key
questions related to the future growth prospects of developing countries -- the marginal association
between portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI flows patterns and subsequent economic takeoffs; the
marginal association between commodity terms of trade shocks and subsequent takeoffs. The importance
of the composition of financial flows is drawing increasing attention among economic researchers and has
been recently examined by Caballero (2010) and Joyce (2010) in the context of banking crises, by
Aizenman, Lee, and Sushko (2010) in the context exchange market pressure, and Aizenman and Sushko
(2011) in the study of growth of externally financially dependent sectors.
We apply probit estimation methodology to assess the relationship between economic takeoffs
during 1950-2000 and inflows of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI. In addition, we control for a
country’s stock of short-term external debt and commodity terms of trade, via a new improved measure.
We find rich and complex marginal association between capital flows and economic takeoffs. Average
level of FDI inflows is associated with a 23 percent higher takeoff probability relative to zero FDI inflow
benchmark, and this effect is highest for the Latin America subsample, with a 65.4 rise in takeoff
probability. Higher stock of short term external debt has been associated with a substantial negative effect
on the probability of a takeoff, and the cumulative effect of the short terms debt overhang is largest for
1

In our sample, the volatility of commodity terms of trade changes (as measured by the conditional standard
deviation) is 18 percent for Latin American and 17 percent for Asian economies compared to 5 percent for OECD
countries.
1

Latin American countries. Yet, virtually all the takeoffs were associated with a rise in portfolio debt
inflows. This effect is substantial for Latin America, while it is virtually absent in Sub-Saharan Africa
countries. An increase in annual portfolio debt inflow from 0 to 0.26 percent of GDP (mean value for the
entire sample) is associated with a 25 percent higher probability of a takeoff. The association between
financial links through portfolio equity flows and takeoffs is negative: a one standard deviation increase
in equity outflows (inflows) is associated with a 47% (17%) decline in the probability of a takeoff. We
also validate the key importance of commodity terms of trade shocks: a one standard deviation
improvement in commodity terms of trade is associated with 28% higher takeoff probability.
The analysis of the duration of takeoffs shows that higher net portfolio debt inflows increase
duration while the opposite is true of equity inflows. Also, greater improvement in a country’s commodity
terms of trade at the time of a takeoff is also associated with a higher probability that a takeoff will be
sustained. In contrast, higher net FDI inflows at the time of the takeoff are associated with lower
probability that the takeoff will be sustained. This finding parallels that of Prasad, Rajan, and
Subramanian (2007), who find that the positive association between FDI and economic growth observed
between 1970 and 2000 was no longer there for 2000 through 2004, and of Aizenman and Sushko (2011),
who find that the relationship between FDI inflows and real sector growth turns from positive to negative
following prolonged periods of steady FDI inflows into a country. One possible interpretation of this
result is that countries in which economic takeoff is driven by FDI inflows converge to a new steady state
faster, hence resulting on shorter duration of high growth rate. Alternatively, “green” FDI may compete
for financing with domestic firms crowding out incumbent firms out of the local bank lending in
emerging markets, especially if domestic financial industry is not sufficiently developed.
Evaluating the economic impact of financial capital inflows on duration, we obtain that for
countries that have entered a takeoff phase average portfolio debt inflow increases the probability that a
takeoff will last 8 years or more by approximately 16.9 percent. Similarly, average net portfolio equity
inflow of 0.08 percent of GDP leads to 12.7 percent lower probability of a sustained takeoff while the
average net FDI inflow of 1.07 percent of GDP at the time of the takeoff leads to 38.5 percent lower
probability of a sustained takeoff.

Data
2.1

Takeoff definition

We employ the methodology of Aizenman and Spiegel (2010) to identify takeoff episodes. A
takeoff is defined as the beginning of a five year consecutive growth of more than 5 percent following a
stagnation episode. A stagnation episode is defined as at least a 5 year interval where the real per capita
2

GDP growth is below 1 percent.2 The data consists of an unbalanced panel of 146 countries from 1950
through 2000. Of these, 114 countries have undergone stagnation episodes between 1960 and 1995 that
could have resulted in a takeoff. Given the takeoff definition employed [see Aizenman and Spiegel
(2010) and the background literature reviewed there], a country can experience more than one potential
takeoff episode and indeed a number of countries underwent more than one takeoff episode during the
sample period. Out of the total 241 stagnation episodes during our sample period, 131 have resulted in
takeoffs (TO=1).
2.2

Financial conditioning variables

The aim of this section is to assess the relative contribution of different types of financial flows to the
probability of a takeoff. Variable definition and sources are summarized in Table A1. We obtain data on
portfolio debt flows, portfolio equity flows, and FDI flows from the IMF International Financial Statistics
(IFS) database. We also control for a country’s stock of short-term external debt using data from the Joint
External Debt Hub (JEDH) database, joint IMF and the World Bank, which is available for countries that
subscribe to the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In order for the results not to be
affected by short-run business cycle fluctuations, in the regression analysis all financial flow and stock
variables enter as 5-year averages (% GDP). In addition, we introduce an improved commodity terms of
trade (CTOT) measure following Ricci et. al (2008). Commodity prices in six categories (food, fuels,
agricultural raw materials, metals, gold, and beverages) are weighted by the shares of each commodity in
the country’s exports and imports then deflated by the manufacturing unit value index (MUV). Since
commodity import and export shares are averaged over time, in addition to being more accurate the
movements in CTOT are invariant to changes in export and import volumes in response to price
fluctuations and thus isolate the impact of commodity prices on a county’s terms of trade (Spatafora and
Tytell (2009)).
Table A2 lists starting observation by country for the data on financial flows and the stock of
short-term external debt. The first column indicates the year(s) in which a country experienced an
economic takeoff. If observations on financial controls end prior to the year 2000, the ending year is
indicated in parentheses. Comparing the dates of economic takeoffs with first available dates on financial
flow variables, Table A2 shows that for a number of countries we are constrained by the data availability
from IFS and JEDH. For instance, the takeoff in Ghana occurred in 1960 whereas the disaggregated data
on financial flows and short-term external debt does not become available until 1985. Similarly, Algeria
underwent an economic takeoff in 1971 whereas the financial flow data does not become available for
this nation until 1975. Thus, the analysis is constrained by data availability for a large subsample of
2

See Aizenman and Spiegel (2010) for the detailed takeoffs definition employed in this paper.
3

countries that underwent a takeoff in the 1960s and 70s. However, to the extent that some of the same
nations had undergone either a period of stagnation with a potential takeoff or a realized second takeoff
episode later in the sample period they still feature in our estimation results.
Table 1 reports conditional and unconditional means and standard deviations of 5-year averages
of financial flows (% GDP), 5-year average stock of short-term external debt (% GDP), and annual
percent change in commodity terms of trade. The conditional summary statistics are calculated for the
subsample defined by countries undergoing a stagnation episode with a potential for a takeoff (TO=0) or
entering an economic takeoff (TO=1), while the unconditional statistics are based on the entire sample,
irrespective of a country’s state of economic growth. The first two columns of Table 1 report conditional
and unconditional mean and standard deviations of capital flows for all countries, while subsequent
columns report the same statistics for Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and OECD countries
separately.
Focusing on the means reported in the first two columns of Table 1, among capital flows, FDI
inflows are the most important category with unconditional average annual inflow of approximately 2
percent of GDP compared to 0.4 percent for portfolio debt and 0.2 percent for portfolio equity inflows
respectively. Both conditional and unconditional shares of FDI inflows are highest in Latin American
economies with 3.4 and 3.3 percent of GDP respectively (columns 3 and 4). In addition, average annual
portfolio equity inflows and FDI inflows are greater than outflows. In particular, FDI inflows from
abroad are an order of magnitude greater than comparable repatriations by domestic citizens (1.22
compared to 0.18 percent of GDP), and this relationship is most pronounced for Latin American
subsample with average annual FDI inflows of 3.44 percent of GDP, two orders of magnitude greater than
comparable repatriations which comprise only 0.02 percent of GDP. As expected, the relationship
between FDI inflows and outflow is more even for OECD countries (0.84 compared and 0.68 percent of
GDP respectively), indicating that foreign direct investment flows tend to originate from developed
countries dominating other types of financial inflows into developing countries during potential and
realized economic takeoff episodes.
Portfolio debt flows play the second most important role among capital flows. Similar to FDI
flows, the countries in our sample experience a net inflow of portfolio debt investment, 0.26 percent of
GDP in annual inflows compared 0.13 percent in outflows. The relationship is even starker for Asian
economies in a potential or a realized takeoff phase, with conditional average inflows more than 15 times
greater than outflows, while it is reverse for Latin American subsample, with annual portfolio debt
outflows approximately two times greater than inflows.
On the other hand, portfolio equity is the least important category of capital flows across all the
subsamples. Similarly to FDI outflows, portfolio equity outflows are negative on average, indicating that
4

domestic citizens are redeeming their overseas equity and direct investments when a country is on the
brink or entering a takeoff phase.
The conditional average stock of short-term external debt is approximately 5.68 percent of GDP
for the entire sample, with Asian and Sub-Saharan Africa countries holding slightly lower shares than the
mean at 4.49 and 4.72 percent of GDP respectively, while Latin American countries on average hold two
times greater share of short-term external debt to GDP at 9.12 percent. Finally, counties in stagnation or
on the brink of a takeoff tend to be experiencing a mild deterioration in the terms of trade at -1.18
percentage points. However, the standard errors for this series are an order of magnitude higher than the
mean for all subsamples except for OECD countries, pointing at a considerable cross-country and time
variation in the terms of trade changes even when smoothed to 5-year tolling averages.

2.3

Additional controls

The remaining controls follow Aizenman and Spiegel (2010) and proxy for a country’s
institutional features, industrial and financial development, political stability, and economic openness. We
measure de facto openness as the ratio of exports plus imports over GDP in local currency units using IFS
data. The average annual tariff rate for each country was obtained from Dollar-Kraay (2004) data. We
measure income level of log of GDP per capita and population as log of total population using Heston,
Summers, and Aten (2009) Penn World Tables 6.3. We combine these variables with regional dummies
for Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and OECD for our base specification.
The baseline specification is then augmented with additional conditioning variables. We measure
years of schooling as the average years of education in the population above the age of 25 from the Barro
and Lee (1993) dataset. The data on commodities, manufacturing, and services as share of GDP come
from the WDI data labeled Comm/GDP, Manuf/GDP, and Serv/GDP respectively. Also from WDI we
obtain measure of domestic credit, liquid liabilities, and money to GDP ratios labeled DomCredit,
Liquidity, and Money respectively. Following Hausmann, Pritchett, and Rodrik (2005), we construct a
political regime change indicator, Reg.Chng., as a three-unit change in the Marshall-Jaggers (2002) Policy
IV dataset. The variable War End takes on a value of 1 if there has been a cessation of conflict within the
previous 5 years and 0 otherwise and the variable Civil War takes on a value of 1 if there has been a civil
war within the previous 5 years and zero otherwise. Both variables come from the Singer and Small
(2003) Correlates of War database. Finally, the Leader Death political variable comes from the Jones and
Olken (2005) dataset and takes on the value of 1 if a country’s leader has died within the previous 5 years
and 0 otherwise.

Non-Parametric Analysis
Table 2 shows the differences in the means of financial flows for subsamples of countries that do

not experience a takeoff with 10 years following a stagnation episode (TO=0) and those that do (TO=1).
Countries that experience a takeoff have somewhat lower level of portfolio debt and FDI outflows on the
on hand and statistically significantly greater level of portfolio debt and FDI inflows on the other. Most
notably, the average FDI inflows are approximately 1.8% higher for countries that experience a takeoff
compared to those that do not. The results are opposite for portfolio equity flows: countries that undergo a
takeoff episode have statistically significantly larger equity outflows and marginally lower equity inflows.
The negative association between portfolio equity outflows and successful transition from economic
stagnation to a takeoff may be due to the flight of domestic savings to foreign equities, especially in Latin
American countries. We address this association in the parametric estimation results. Finally, countries
that undergo a takeoff following a stagnation phase have on average lower stock of short-term external
debt (% GDP) and an increase in commodity terms of trade (CTOT), but these differences are statistically
insignificant in this preliminary non-parametric examination.
Figures 1 through 3 illustrate the time-series relationship between selected takeoff conditioning
variables and economic growth for three countries from each of the following regions: Caribbean-Latin
America, East and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The year(s) in which a country experienced an
economic takeoff are marked with vertical bars. As Figure 1 shows, the growth rate of real GDP exhibits
a negative association with a country’s stock of short-term external debt. Taking Philippines as an
example, the rise in short-term external debt from less than 10 percent to 30 percent of GDP between
1975 and 1982 was followed by a sharp contraction in annual GDP growth rate from close to 5 to -10
percent per year over the same time period. This period of economic stagnation was finally followed by a
takeoff in 1992, which was preceded by a reduction in short-term external debt to its pre-1975 level of
approximately 10 percent of GDP.
Figure 2 focuses on the association between economic growth and FDI inflows. Consistent with
the subsample analysis of the means in Table 1, the graphical examination points at the positive comovement in the two series. Focusing on the experience of Fiji and Mexico, the 1983 and 1995 respective
takeoffs in the two countries were preceded by a rise in annual FDI inflows (from approximately 0 to 2
percent of GDP in Fiji and from 1 to 3 percent of GDP in Mexico).
Finally, Figure 3 examines the time-series behavior of GDP growth rates and change in a
country’s commodity terms of trade (CTOT). As in the case with FDI inflows, the series exhibit positive
co-movement for the majority of the selected countries. Focusing on Latin American countries, economic
growth and CTOT of Argentina, Chile, and Mexico exhibit a close relationship. Both the 1973 and 1983

6

takeoff episodes in Chile were preceded by a change in CTOT movement from deterioration (less than 0)
to an improvement (greater than 0) in the years prior.

Parametric Analysis
4.1

Methodology

Following Aizenman and Spiegel (2010) we use a probit estimation methodology. Specifically
for a country i we estimate the conditional probability of TO=1 given our set of financial flow and stock
variables and a number of country level controls:

We are most interested in the coefficient vector on xi, as well as coefficients on short-term
external debt and change in CTOT. The remaining controls have been examined by AS2010 and are
included for robustness. The estimation is conducted with robust standard errors clustered by country, as
several countries in the sample undergo more than one takeoff episode. Having obtained the coefficient
vector, we can evaluate the marginal effect of each control variable on the conditional expectation of a
takeoff:

Probit regressions allow to evaluate the marginal contribution of each conditioning variable to the
probability of TO=1, with partial effect in (2) estimated at the sample average of all controls variables.

7

We then evaluate the economic impact of each control on the probability of a takeoff in three
ways. The first method consists of multiplying the estimate of the partial effect in (2) by the variable’s
mean, which gives us an estimate of the probability change relative to the benchmark of zero for the
control of interest. For example, by multiplying the mean annual FDI inflows by their partial contribution
to the probability of a takeoff in (2) we obtain an estimate of the change in the likelihood of a takeoff
relative to the case if the country was experiencing zero FDI inflows. The second method consists of
multiplying the value in equation (2) by the variable’s standard deviation to evaluate its economic impact
on the probability of a takeoff. Both first and second method assume that the marginal contribution of
each explanatory variable to the probability of TO=1 is constant across the entire support, which is the
same as assuming a linear cumulative probability density, a highly unrealistic assumption. Therefore, the
third method consists of measuring the differences in the predicted probabilities of a takeoff between
specific countries whose values of conditional variables are approximately one standard deviation apart,
with the lower value drawn close to the sample mean.

4.2

Estimation Results

The probit regression results for baseline specification used in the standard deviation analysis
above are reported in Table 3. Specifications (1) through (6) report probit estimates for all countries, with
specifications (4) through (6) including the stock of short-term external debt (% GDP) in the control
vector. Specifications (7) and (8) exclude countries classified as “High Income” in the WDI data focusing
only on “Low & Middle Income” countries. Instead of reporting the probit coefficient vector that does not
have a ready economic interpretation, we report marginal effects of each independent variable and the
associated standard errors. The interpretation follows equation (2) and quantifies the probability change of
observing a takeoff due to a unit change in the conditioning variable. For example, focusing on
specification (2) used in the one standard deviation analysis in previous sections, the coefficient of -0.54
on Latin American dummy indicates that evaluated at sample means of the entire control vector, the
probability of TO=1 is 54 percent lower for Latin American economies.
As a way to check the goodness of fit of the mode, Figure 3 plots probit regression residuals and
well as actual versus fitted values based on regression specification (2) in Table 6. As the figure shows,
the residuals are fairly well behaved and centered around zero. The model fits the majority of takeoff
episodes fairly well, with substantial errors resulting when the model predicted a takeoff where one was
not realized in 1982 in Australia and in 1983 in Comoros.

8

As results reported in Table 3 indicate, most associations between takeoff probability and
financial capital flows are robust to alternative specifications. The marginal effect of portfolio debt
inflows on takeoff probability is positive and statistically significant in 7 out of 8 specifications. The
marginal effects of both equity inflows and outflows are negative (with the exception of outflows in
specifications (4) and (6)), while the marginal effects of links through FDI flows are positive and
statistically significant in a number of specifications.
Since economic takeoffs are primarily a feature of emerging and developing economies,
specifications (7) and (8) only include low and middle income countries in the sample. The effect of
portfolio debt outflow is negative but becomes statistically significant (-0.899*** compared to -0.043)
while the positive effect of portfolio debt inflows more than doubles in magnitude (2.026*** compared to
0.905***) in specification (7) compared to specification (1). The coefficients on portfolio equity flows
remain negative, with the effect of a 1 percentage point increase in portfolio equity outflows taking on the
value of -3.854* compared to -3.316** and the negative marginal effect of portfolio equity inflows
becoming significantly larger and statistically significant (-3.715*** compared to -0.901) in specification
(7) compared to specification (1). Focusing on the third capital flow category, the marginal effect of FDI
outflows is insignificant when high income countries are excluded from the sample, while the coefficient
on remains positive and significant with approximately the same magnitude. The marginal effect of
commodity terms of trade improvement is also positive and statistically significant. Overall, the
specifications (7) and (8) indicate that the marginal effects of most capital flows on the probability of
economic takeoff are more pronounced when only low and middle income countries are considered. The
marginal effect of portfolio debt, FDI inflows, and commodity terms of trade are positive, with the effect
of debt more than double for this subsample of countries, while the negative effects of portfolio debt
outflows and portfolio equity flows in both directions are larger in magnitude.
Focusing on the stock of “hot money,” as specifications (3) through (6) indicate the marginal
effect of stock of short-term external debt is negative, confirming the popular prior that unlike direct
investment, “hot money” is detrimental to economic takeoffs. Notably, the data on short-term external
debt is available for a smaller sample, reducing the number of observations from above 90 in
specifications (1) through (3) to 65 or less in specification (5) through (6), which can result in the
instability of coefficients on several controls variables.
Table 4 shows probit estimation results of the association between financial flows and takeoffs
with expanded set of controls following (note that controls from the baseline specification also included
in the regression but results not reported for brevity). The results indicate that the positive association
between the probability of a takeoff and foreign debt investment flows as well as between the two-way
FDI flows and takeoffs is robust to controlling for a set of political, industrial, financial, and demographic
9

country characteristics. Unlike linkages through FDI flows, linkages through equity markets exhibit a
negative association with the probability of a takeoff, with coefficients on portfolio investment equity
asset flows particularly robust. In addition, portfolio debt outflows also exhibit negative association with
the probability of a takeoff. However, the significance of the coefficients is not very robust to alternative
specifications. The association between takeoffs and short-term external debt is statistically significant
and robust given this larger set of controls. Overall, the results of Table 4 are consistent with baseline
regressions indicating that takeoff episodes are positively associated with inflows of foreign debt
investments and two-way FDI linkages and negatively associated with financial capital flows abroad and
the buildup of short-term external debt.
Table 5 reports baseline regression results interacting financial flow variables with selected
regional dummies. A conjecture being examined is that the negative association between equity flows
abroad is a feature of Latin American countries where foreign equities traditionally serve as a store of
value of a large segment of wealth population. The coefficient on the interaction term between portfolio
equity assets and Latin America dummy is negative, statistically significant, and an order of magnitude
larger indicating that this feature is characteristic of Latin American economies.

4.3

Economic Impact

Table 6 and Table 7 report the estimated economic impact of the conditioning variables on the
probability of a takeoff. Table 6 shows the estimates obtained by multiplying subsample mean value of
each variable by its marginal effect in equation (2) giving the change in the probability of TO=1 due to
the deviation in the explanatory variable from zero by its subsample mean. For example, an increase in
annual portfolio debt inflow from 0 to 0.26 percent of GDP (mean value for the entire sample (Table 1))
is associated with a 24.6 percent higher probability of a takeoff. Average level of FDI inflows is
associated with a 23.2 percent higher takeoff probability relative to zero FDI inflow benchmark and this
effect is highest for the Latin America subsample with a 65.4 rise in takeoff probability. Higher stock of
short-term external debt has a substantial negative effect on the probability of a takeoff. Given the sample
mean short-term debt holdings of 5.7 percent of GDP (see Table 1), the probability of an economic
takeoff is 25.6 percent lower relative to the zero short-term debt benchmark. The cumulative effect is
largest for Latin American countries, where, given their average short-term debt holdings, the probability
of a takeoff is reduced by 41.0 percent relative to the zero debt benchmark.
The results in Table 7 are based on standard deviations for the entire sample and the subsamples
of Latin American, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian countries. Focusing on the variables with statistically
significant coefficients (denoted by asterisks), a one standard deviation increase in the inflow of portfolio
debt is associated with 71.1 percent higher probability of a takeoff. The effect is even larger for Asia
10

(93.7 percent) suggesting that virtually all the takeoffs in these countries during our sample period were
associated with a rise in portfolio debt inflows. At 41.5 percent, the effect is also substantial for Latin
America, while it is virtually absent in Sub-Saharan Africa countries (0.1 percent).
In contrast to portfolio debt inflows, the association between portfolio equity flows and takeoffs
is negative. In particular, a one standard deviation increase in equity outflows is associated with a 47.0
percent decline in the probability of a takeoff. The effect is much smaller for geographical subsamples,
indicating that given this methodology it is driven by large standard deviation in portfolio equity outflows
of OECD countries (the standard deviation of these flows is 0.23 percent of GDP in OECD compared to
0.02 in Latin American countries).
Unlike portfolio equity flows, greater linkages through FDI flows exhibit positive association
with the probability of a successful transition from economic stagnation to a takeoff. A one standard
deviation increase in FDI outflows is associated with a 62.3 percent higher probability of an economic
takeoff. As is the case with the one standard deviation analysis for equity outflows, this high figure for the
combined sample is driven by high standard deviation of FDI outflows from OECD countries. The next
row in Table 7 shows that a one standard deviation rise in FDI inflows is associated with 75.5 percent
greater chance of an economic takeoff. The impact is 84.7 percentage points for Latin American countries
while it is lower for Sub-Saharan Africa and Asian countries at 18.7 and 29.3 percentage points
respectively.
The positive association between FDI flows and takeoff probability can be substantially offset if a
country accumulates the stock a short-term external debt. A one standard deviation rise short-term
external debt as a percentage of GDP is associated with 37.5 lower takeoff probability. The impact is
more severe in Latin American countries at -55.7 percentage points, while slightly below the full sample
average in absolute value for African and Asian economies.
Finally, a one standard deviation improvement in commodity terms of trade is associated with a
28.4 percent higher takeoff probability. At 31.0 percent, the association is marginally higher for Latin
American countries, most likely due to greater proportion of commodity exporters in this region.
As mentioned above, the marginal contribution of control variables to the probability of a takeoff
is estimated at a point on the cumulative density corresponding to the sample means of controls. Since the
relationship between the takeoff probability and the values of the conditioning variables is not necessarily
linear, the first derivative of the density function that captures the marginal effect of an incremental
increase in control to the probability of TO=1 is also subject to change. The sensitivity of the estimates
presented in Table 6 and Table 7 to the value of controls is captured in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The figures
show predicted probability of a takeoff as a function of portfolio debt inflows and portfolio equity
outflows respectively (both significant determinants of takeoff in the probit regressions). The fitted line
11

represents the best fractional polynomial fit to the predicted probabilities. Since the predicted probability
density is best fitted by a concave curve, the marginal effects are not constant along the support of each
control variable. To address this issue, we pick actual observations for each control variable that are
approximately one standard deviation apart and report the associated change in the predicted value for the
probability of TO=1. Table 8 reports the results.
Focusing on the variables with significant coefficients in the probit regressions, Table 8 shows
that a rise in 5-year average portfolio debt inflow from 0.25 (South Africa in 1991) to 1.03 percent of
GDP (Thailand in 1998) is associated with a rise in predicted probability of a takeoff of 39.3 percent. A
rise in portfolio equity outflow from -0.03 (repatriation in Korea in 1994) to 0.11 percent of GDP (Israel
in 1989) is associated with a fall in predicted takeoff probability of 60.5 percent. Also, as the previous
estimates indicated, FDI flows are positively associated with predicted takeoff probabilities. In particular,
a rise in FDI inflows from 1.24 (Mexico in 1980) to 5.71 percent of GDP (Malaysia in 1992) is associated
with a 74.0 percentage point rise in the predicted takeoff probability. On the other hand, a rise in the 5year average of the stock of short-term external debt from 5.5 (Mexico in 1980) to 14.6 percent of GDP
(Bolivia in 1986) is associated a 20 percentage point decline in the predicted probability of a takeoff. The
negative relationship between stock of short-term external debt and takeoff probability is shown in Figure
7. For a given increase in the stock of short-term external debt, the decline in the predicted probability of
a takeoff appears rapid and monotone, with correlation coefficient of -0.2081 (p-value = 0.000). Unlike
the association between financial flows, which was highly non-linear, the negative relationship between
short-term external debt and takeoff probability is fairly well approximated by a linear fit, which is
consistent with similar magnitude of economic impact for this variable reported in Tables 6 and 7. Overall,
in terms of the relative magnitudes of the predicted impact on the probability of a takeoff, the results
reported in Table 8 are broadly consistent with estimates under more restrictive assumptions reported in
Table 7.
The heightened volatility of commodity prices renewed concerns about the greater exposure of
developing countries to commodity terms of trade shocks, as a given change in the relative prices of
commodities tends to induce a much larger income effect in poorer countries. Figure 8 shows that the
association percent change in commodity terms of trade (dCTOT) and the probability of a takeoff (TO=1)
is highly dependent on country income. More precisely, the figure depicts the income effect of
commodity terms of trade shock for countries of different income levels.
The income effect is proxied by the marginal effect of a positive commodity terms of trade shock
on the on the probability of a takeoff. The left axis shows marginal effects estimated with baseline probit
specification (2) at the given income level (horizontal axis, log scale); z-statistics of estimated coefficients
in parentheses. Points of GDP per capita corresponding to subsamples averages of Sub-Saharan Africa,
12

Latin America, Asia, and OECD are labeled accordingly. Marginal effect of approximately 1.7 for a
country with GDP per capita of $4,000 (which is the subsample average for Asian countries) indicates
that a 1 percent improvement in the commodity terms of trade is associated with a 1.6 percent higher
predicted probability of economic takeoff. Note that both the magnitude and statistical significance of
marginal effects of dCTOT on Pr(TO=1) are highest for developing Latin American and Asian economies
in the middle income range, then drops off dramatically with income.
The right axis follows the one-standard deviation analysis procedure showing the product of the
marginal effect coefficient in baseline specification (2) multiplied by the subsample standard deviation of
dCTOT for each income range. For a country with income level of approximately $4,000 per capita a one
standard deviation improvement in commodity terms of trade is associated with greater than 25 percent
higher probability of a takeoff. Thus, a one standard deviation improvement in the terms of trade in Latin
American and Asian economics translates into a 25 percentage and 28 percentage points higher takeoff
probability compared to a much lower 6 percentage point improvement for OECD economies. Overall,
the marginal effects from the baseline probit regression estimated at different income levels confirm the
notion that developing economies are much more sensitive to commodity terms of trade shocks, with
estimates for these countries larger in both magnitude and in statistical significance.

Determinants of sustained takeoffs

This section examines the relationship between duration of takeoffs and the nature of financial
exposure at the time of the takeoff. Following Aizenman and Spiegel (2010), we define sustained takeoffs
as periods of high growth lasting at least 8 years. Given such second stage of conditioning, the sample is
significantly reduced. To compensate, we reduce the control vector by looking at net flows in each
financial capital category. Table 9 presents the marginal effects from probit estimation results.
Consistent with their association with an occurrence of a takeoff, higher net portfolio debt inflows
raise the probability of a sustained takeoff while net portfolio equity inflows lower the probability of a
sustained takeoff. Also consistent with the its association with an initial takeoff, greater improvement in a
country’s commodity terms of trade at the time of a takeoff is associated with a higher probability that a
takeoff will be sustained.
However, the association between net inflows of FDI at the time of the takeoff has the opposite
impact on its duration. While the preceding analysis shows that higher FDI inflows are associated with
higher probability of an economic takeoff, the negative and statistically significant marginal effect
reported in Table 9 indicates that higher net FDI inflows at the time of the takeoff are associated with
lower probability that the takeoff will be sustained. This finding parallels that of Prasad, Rajan, and
Subramanian (2007), who find that the positive association between FDI and economic growth observed
13

between 1970 and 2000 was no longer there for 2000 through 2004, and of Aizenman and Sushko (2011),
who find that the relationship between FDI inflows and real sector growth turns from positive to negative
following prolonged periods of steady FDI inflows into a country. One possible interpretation of this
result is that countries in which economic takeoff is driven by FDI inflows converge to a new steady state
faster, hence resulting on shorter duration of high growth rate. Alternatively, “green” FDI may compete
for financing with domestic firms crowding out incumbent firms out of the local bank lending in
emerging markets, especially if domestic financial industry is not sufficiently developed.
Next, we assess the economic impact of the three types of capital flows relative to the zero
benchmark using their averages conditional on country being in a takeoff phase. Multiplying the 0.47
percent of GDP average net portfolio debt inflow by the 0.36 marginal effect reported in specification (1)
of Table 9, we obtain that for countries that have entered a takeoff phase average portfolio debt inflow
increases the probability that a takeoff will last 8 years or more by approximately 16.9 percent. Similarly,
average net portfolio equity inflow of 0.08 percent of GDP leads to 12.7 percent lower probability of a
sustained takeoff while the average net FDI inflow of 1.07 percent of GDP at the time of the takeoff leads
to 38.5 percent lower probability of a sustained takeoff.
Moving to the interpretation of additional controls, country income exhibits a negative
association with takeoff duration, indicating that the probability of a sustained high rate of economic
growth is lower for economies with higher GDP per capita at the time of the takeoff. The marginal
effects of population and openness are positive, indicating that more populous open economies tend to
experience longer lasting periods of high growth following entry into a takeoff phase. Focusing on
regional dummies, in most specifications Latin American, Asian, and Sub-Saharan African countries tend
to experience shorter takeoff, which the negative marginal effect of the Sub-Saharan dummy particularly
robust. Finally, a positive marginal effect of regime change dummy indicates that the likelihood of a
sustained takeoff is higher if it was preceded by a political regime change.
The last specification in Table 9 includes the stock of short-term external debt as a control. The
marginal effect is negative, however not statistically significant at the 10 percent level. In addition,
combined with greater censoring of the dependent variable and data availability on the “hot money”
variable, the sample is greatly reduced, making inference based on this specification somewhat
problematic.

6.

Conclusion

We apply probit estimation methodology to assess the relationship between economic takeoffs
during 1950-2000 and inflows of portfolio debt, portfolio equity, and FDI. In addition, we control for a
country’s stock of short-term external debt and commodity terms of trade, via a new improved measure.
14

We find rich and complex marginal association between capital flows and economic takeoffs. Regionally,
Latin American economies exhibit the greatest sensitivity to financial linkages. The association between
financial links through portfolio equity flows and takeoffs is negative. So is the association with stock of
short term external debt, with the cumulative effect of the short terms debt overhang largest for Latin
American. Yet, virtually all the takeoffs were associated with a rise in portfolio debt inflows. This effect
is also substantial for Latin America, while it is virtually absent in Sub-Saharan Africa countries.
Average level of FDI inflows is associated with a higher takeoff probability and this effect is highest for
the Latin America subsample. We also validate the key importance of commodity terms of trade shocks: a
one standard deviation improvement in commodity terms of trade is associated with 28% higher takeoff
probability.
The analysis of the duration of takeoffs shows that higher net portfolio debt inflows increase
duration while the opposite is true of equity inflows. Also, greater improvement in a country’s commodity
terms of trade at the time of a takeoff is associated with a higher probability that a takeoff will be
sustained. In contrast, higher net FDI inflows at the time of the takeoff are associated with lower
probability that the takeoff will be sustained. Comparing the economic magnitudes of the association with
each type of private capital inflow, FDI exhibits the largest (and negative) effect, potentially offsetting the
positive effect of portfolio debt inflows in sustaining the takeoff episodes. In sum, not just the degree of
financial openness, but the nature of financial integration matters greatly for a country’s prospect of
entering and sustaining economic takeoffs. Furthermore, the complex association between FDI and
economic takeoffs – direct financing is associated with greater number of takeoffs, but not with the most
sustained ones – is in line with several recent studies that detect complex and non-linear association
between the accumulation of FDI and growth.

Notes: The last column of the table measures the difference in the predicted probability of a takeoff between specific
countries whose values of conditional variables are approximately one standard deviation apart, with the lower value
drawn close to the sample mean. This methodology is robust to the concavity in the shape of the cumulative
probability distribution function.

Figure 1: Economic growth and change in the stock of short-term external debt for selected countries.

Notes: The figure corroborates negative association between economic growth and a country’s stock of short-term external debt for selected countries (three from
Caribbean-Latin America, East and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa respectively). Takeoff episodes indicated with vertical bars.
25

Figure 2: Economic growth and FDI inflows for selected countries.

Notes: The figure corroborates positive association between economic growth and a country’s FDI inflow for selected countries (three from Caribbean-Latin
America, East and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa respectively). Takeoff episodes indicated with vertical bars.

Figure 7: Predicted probability of a takeoff based on probit regression results and short-term external debt.

Notes: The figure shows the predicted probability of a takeoff based on probit regression results and the stock of
short-term external debt with best linear fit. The correlation coefficient is negative and significant at -0.2081***
(p-value = 0.000).

Figure 8: The effect of commodity terms of trade shocks on the probability of a takeoff for different
income levels.

Notes: The figure depicts the income effect of commodity terms of trade shock for countries of different income
levels. The income effect is proxied by the marginal effect of a positive commodity terms of trade shock on the on
the probability of a takeoff. The left axis shows marginal effects estimated with baseline probit specification (2) at
the given income level (horizontal axis, log scale); z-statistics of estimated coefficients in parentheses. Points of
GDP per capita corresponding to subsamples averages of Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia, and OECD are
labeled accordingly. Marginal effect of approximately 1.7 for a country with GDP per capita of $4,000 (which is the
subsample average for Asian countries) indicates that a 1 percent improvement in the commodity terms of trade is
associated with a 1.6 percent higher predicted probability of economic takeoff. The right axis shows the product of
the marginal effect coefficient and subsample standard deviation of dCTOT for each income range. For a country
with income level of approximately $4,000 per capita a one standard deviation improvement in commodity terms of
trade is associated with greater than 25 percent higher probability of a takeoff.
