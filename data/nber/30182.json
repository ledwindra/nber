    "abstract": "\n\nWe study how individual political views shape firm behavior and labor market outcomes using new micro-data from Brazil. We first show that business owners are considerably more likely to employ copartisan workers. This phenomenon is in part driven by the overlapping of political and social networks. Multiple tests\u2014a survey, an event study, analyses of wage premia and promotions within the firm, and a field experiment\u2014further highlight how business owners\u2019 political preferences directly influence firms\u2019 employment decisions. A channel of political discrimination appears more relevant than one of political quid-pro-quo between firms and politicians.\n\n",
