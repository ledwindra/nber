MEASURING THE AVERAGE MARGINAL TAX RATE
FROM THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX

Abstract

The economic effects of taxation depend on the configuration of marginal

tax rates. We consider here the appropriate measure of a marginal tax rate
for the federal individual income tax, which has a graduated—rate structure
and allows

for numerous legal and

illegal deductions from total income •

Hence, we construct approximately weighted

of these marginal tax rates for 1916—80. When weighted by adjusted

gross income, the arithmetic average of marginal tax rates is 5% in 1920, 2%
in 1930, 6% in 1940, 20% in 1950, 23% in 1960, 24% in 1970, and 30% in 1980.

We also discuss the dispersion of marginal tax rates, as well as the behavior

of average tax rates and deductions from taxable income. One noteworthy result
concerns the fraction of adjusted gross income that accrues to families that

face a marginal tax rate of at least 35%. This fraction quadruples from 1964
to 1980.

In order to assess the economic effects of taxation, we have to know the

applicable marginal tax rates for individuals or businesses. For example,
marginal tax rates on income affect decisions to work, produce, save and in-

vest. However, the readily available data refer to totals of tax collections
in various categories, such as individual income taxes, corporate profits

and so on.

There have been some attempts—notably, Joines (1981) and Seater (1982)—.-

to use more detailed data to compute average marginal tax rates. Basically,,
for the federal individual income tax, they look across classes of adjusted
gross

income from the IRS data to see how taxes

come per

paid per return vary with in-

return. They then use the ratio of the change in taxes per return

to the change in income per return to calculate marginal tax

rates. Generally—

as Joines and Seater argue is appropriate——this concept of a marginal tax rate

substantially smaller than the explicit rate from the tax schedule. But,
as we discuss later, there are problems in interpreting their concept of a
is

marginal tax rate in terms of the underlying substitution effects on individuals'

choices. In fact,

the

concept for many purposes)

In the present paper we focus on the federal individual income tax. This
category is interesting for several reasons. First, it is large——467. of federal

and 30% of total

government revenues

in 1980. Second, the appropriate dis—

aggregated data are available. Third, because of the graduated—rate structure,
the differences between marginal and average tax rates are likely to be im-

portant. However, a full measure of marginal tax rates would incorporate other
levies, some of which are based on property or expenditures, rather than on

income. We do plan to include soon the social security tax,2 which constitutes
26% of federal and 17% of total government revenues in 1980. We may also consider other types of taxes, but even the full array of these would not be

sufficient. That's because a full concept of a marginal tax rate encompasses
also the transfers that people lose when they earn additional income. Thus
far, we have no plans to tackle this issue.

Theoretical Considerations

We set up a simple model to deal with the following question. What is
the appropriate concept of a marginal tax rate in the context of an income

tax that first, has a graduated—rate structure, and second, that allows for
numerous legal and illegal

deductions

in the calculation of taxable income?3

In particular, what is the relation among the following:
• the various substitution effects on people's choices,
• the explicit tax rates from the tax schedule,
• the marginal association between taxes and total income (which is
the Joines—Seater concept of a marginal tax rate), and
• the average tax rates?

Consider a family that receives market income, Y. This income comes partly

from working the amount L at the wage w, and partly from non—labor income, I.
Hence, total market income is

plus any excess allowances for business and moving expenses, plus the pre—

The relation of taxes to taxable income comes from the law, which specifies

who expends no effort, the quantity of deductions generated here is the

We

can also think of the function, f(X) , as

incorporating the goods—equivalent of any penalties for tax—cheating, as
well as the probability of being caught. Finally, we note that for some
occupations, such as the self—employed, the ease of concealing income and

taking excessive business expenses implies that deductions, f(X) ,

are

large for a small amount of effort.

The second term in equation (3), aC2, describes the effects of favored

consumption. We treat a as a positive fraction, since——except for some
limitations on the amounts of charitable contributions——there do not seem
to be important sources of diminishing effects of favored consumption on

deductions. (Business expenses could be entered explicitly as another source

might

enter is through the standard deduction, which depends on adjusted gross

income in some years. But, this provision turns out to be quantitatively unimportant for most purposes, because the standard deduction varies with in-

1944—63, the standard deduction is 10%

$1,000. (Currently, the standard deduction does

not depend on income.). In any case, we neglect these features of the standard
deduction in our analysis.

Another possibility is that the IRS's examination effort varies with a
family's adjusted gross income, as well, as with the claimed amounts of deduc-

tions. (It might depend also on occupation and other characteristics.) Then,

—5—

depending on the IRS's procedure, someone with more adjusted gross income
would find it either easier or harder to generate a given amount of deductions.

That is, some measure of income would appear in our function, f(X)

.

In

fact, our subsequent analysis can be used to design an optimal pattern of
enforcement by the IRS, which would include a possible dependence of the

IRS's effort on someone's income. Although it would be interesting to explore this idea, we have not yet done so..

Finally, income might matter because of some limitations on

categories

of itemized deductions. For contributions, more Income means more potential
deductions. However, for medical expenses and now for casualty losses, an
increase in income means that less deductions can be claimed. Also, there
are limitations on the amounts of interest expense that relate to"investment

purposes." Here, an increase in someone's income from capital can increase
these allowable deductions. Miller and Scholes (1978) stress this point.
In any case, our present analysis does not incorporate any direct effects

of income in the function that generates deductions. Later on, we note the
consequences of inchtding Income in this function.

where the partial derivatives are U1, U2>O and U3<O. Families maximize
utility, subject to the budget constraint from equation (4), the definition

equations (2) and (3). The resulting first-order conditions can be written

as follows

Equation (6) determines the amount of resources, X, that people put into

tax avoidance. At the margin, the gain from applying an extra unit of
resources is the extra deductions, f', multiplied by the marginal tax rate

from the schedule, T'. Hence, people go to the point where the marginal

gain, f'T', equals the marginal cost, 1. It follows that people with a
higher marginal tax rate, V--which will typically be those with higher total
incomes--go to a lower value of f'. Correspondingly, they spend more
resources, X, on avoidance, and end up with more deductions, D.
Equation (7) says that the utility rate of substitution between ordinary consumption, C1, and "leisure" equals the after-tax wage rate, where the
adjustment for taxes uses the marginal rate from the tax schedule, T'.
Therefore, although people use resources and favored consumption to reduce
their taxes, it is still the explicit marginal tax rate from the schedule

that affects the allocation between ordinary consumption and leisure. That's
because, at the margin, people have the option to work an extra unit, earn

won this amount, retain w(l-T') as additional disposable income (since X
and C2 do not shift at this margin), and spend the funds on cl.8

—7.-

On the other hand, when choosing favored consumption, C2, households

consider the marginal effect, a, on deductions. Therefore, in equation (8),
the utility rate of substitution between favored consumption and leisure

equals a different measure of the after-tax wage. The pertinent marginal tax

rate here is T'(l-a)/(l-aT'), which is below T'since O<ct<l. applies. (Viewed
alternatively, the utility rate of substitution between C' and C2 equals

1-aT', because of the preferential tax treatment for C2.)

Average Tax Rates and Deductions
For some purposes, we would like to know how taxes vary cross-sectionally

with total income, Y. We can think of the variations in Y as generated from
underlying differences in either non-labor income, I, or in the wage rate, w.

Then, we have

Therefore, the marginal relation of taxes to income, dT/dY ,

is

below the explicit

marginal tax rate, T', because of the positive relation between income and

deductions, dD/dY. This last term is positive because first, more income
means more effort spent at tax avoidance--that is, dX/dY>O--and second,

more income means more favored consumption--that is, dC2/dY>O. We also

follow unambiguously as long as 0 < dC2/dY < 1

(All of these results

holds.) Finally, we get

the last expression in equation (9) by substituting the condition, f'

l/T' ,

from equation (6).
Consider how the average tax rate, T/Y , changes with total income, Y
Since taxes are zero until total income reaches some positive amount (because

-8-

some deductions accrue with zero effort), and since the marginal tax rate, T' ,

rises

with taxable income, the average tax rate tends also to increase with

total income. In order for this possibly not to hold throughout, we need a

range of income where the term, dT/dY ,

positive effects of income on dD/dY , so that the ratio of deductions to income,
D/Y , can

increase with income over some interval. But, the diminishing returns

to tax avoidance——that is, f" < 0—works against this. If we neglect the role
of favored consumption, C2 ,

and look

only at the..response of the effort for

tax—avoidance, X , then we tend to get a diminishing effect of income on dD/dY.9
Hence, dT/dY——and, moreover, the average tax rate, T/Y——tend to increase with

total income, Y
There seem to be two main possibilities for reversing this result • First,
there may be ranges where set—up costs for tax avoidance are important, so

that the concavity of the f—function does not hold throughout. Then, there may
be

regions where D/Y rises with income, so that T/Y may decline.

footnote 10, above).

Overall, it is not easy theoretically to generate positive effects of total

But, as mentioned before, some others—for example, Joines

(1981) and Seater (1982)——attempt to calculate the expression, dT/dY

(Empirically, they measure Y by adjusted gross income, rather than by total
income, which is unobservable.) Therefore, this alternative procedure includes

the response of deductions, dD/dY ,

in

the measure of a "marginal tax rate."

Clearly, this expression understates the marginal tax rate, T' , which applies
to the substitution between ordinary goods and work. But, we may also be in-

terested in the lower marginal tax rate, T'(l —

which

applies

to the margin between favored goods, C2 , and work. Under a very special condition, the Joines—Seater construct, dT/dY , approximates an appropriate weighted

Weightizg
Suppose that we know each family's marginal income—tax rate, T ,

at

a particular date. We want to construct an aggregate index——or average mar-

ginal tax rate——T, which can be used to understand some aggregate behavior. As is usual, we cannot construct a single index that works satisfactorily in all contexts. But, there are some interesting special cases,
which suggest that it might be valuable to construct some indices.

Assume first that the logarithm of each family's total consumption

demand, C , depends linearly on the marginal tax rate, T ——that is,12
(10)

log(C) =

(We can think alternatively of the supply of goods, Y , as depending on
.)

Now, if everyone's slope coefficient, b , on T in equation (10) is

the same, then we can readily construct a useful measure of average marginal

tax rates. This average is a linear combination of the T with weights equal

to Ct/C , where

(11)

C is aggregate consumption——that is,

?' — E(c /C)T'

Here, the relation of aggregate consumption to the constructed average marginal

tax rate will reveal the coon slope coefficient. Specifically, the propor—

tional response of C to V approximates the underlying coefficient, b .

(The

result turns Out to be approximate because our measures for changes in V pick
up some effects from shifts in weights.) Empirically, we use shares of adjusted

gross income to proxy- for the weights by shares of consumption.
Alternatively, we might have that each family's consumption exhibits a constant elasticity of response to the fraction of income that they keep at the

empirically, these two types of indices for average

marginal tax rates do not differ greatly.
For some purposes——for example, when measuring employment

or

unemployment—

we count numbers of persons, rather than amounts of consumption or income.
Then, in the formulas from equations (11) or (13), we can think of the weight,
Ct/C , as reflecting the 1th family's share of total workers or persons, rather

than of consumption or income. Hence, we would be more interested in person—
weighted average marginal tax rates, rather than in income—weighted numbers.

Operationally, we can construct indices of average marginal

tax rates

where the

individual rates are weighted by numbers of returns, rather than by adjusted

gross income. The indices weighted by numbers of returns are typically much
lower than those weighted by adjusted gross income.

consistent manner over time. (This reflects either progress or shifting tastes.)
Therefore, we combine the sources as follows:

1961—77, 1979—80: There are tables classified by the highest marginal
tax rates that apply to each return. (For 1980, the tables are

in

Statistics

of Income Bulletin, December 1982.) These tables show the numbers of returns
and the adjusted gross and taxable income that apply in each class. From
these tables we can compute average marginal tax rates, using either shares

of adjusted gross income or shares of numbers of returns as weights. However,
we have to make some approximations in order to take account of the maximum tax

rate on earned income (60% in 1971, 50% for 1972—80). Basically, for those
who pay the maximum tax, we treat their marginal tax rate as 50% (60% in 1971)

about 4%

of the

aggregate of adjusted gross income applies to returns that use the 50% maximum

1954—60: There are tables classified by ranges of taxable income per
return and by filing status (married/filing jointly, single, etc.). Using the
tax schedule foz each filing status, we can compute

rate.14

the associated marginal tax

However, these tables do not provide information about adjusted gross

income. So, we calculate here only the average marginal tax rates when weighted
by numbers of returns.

-

1916—43: The tables are classified by net income, which is roughly
taxable income plus exemptions for self, spouse and other dependents. The
tax—rate schedules do not depend on marital status for these years. Within
each class of net income, we make the approximation that everyone has the

same taxable income——that is, we neglect variations in the ratio of exemp-

tions to net income. For the purposes of calculating average marginal tax
rates, this approximation is probably satisfactory. (The true dispersion in
examptions would not be too large and the marginal tax rates would be roughly

linear, within each class, in taxable income.) Then, we can calculate marginal tax rates for each class of net income. We also have the data to weight
these figures by numbers of returns and by total income, which corresponds

roughly to adjusted gross income plus business expenses of individuals. This
weighting by total income approximates that by adjusted gross income

later years.

for

the

1944—78: We have tables classified by ranges of adjusted gross income
per return and by filing status. The tables indicate for each class the amounts
of taxable income and tax liabilities. We can compute marginal tax rates if
we assume that each taxpayer in a given class has the same taxable income.

More generally, our averages will be okay if the dispersion of marginal tax

rates within a class is roughly linear in taxable income. In any event, we
use these computations only to fill in the missing years from the other tables.

These are 1944—60 and 1978 for the indices weighted by adjusted gross income,

and 1944—53 and 1978 for those weighted by numbers of returns. We fill in the
missing data based on the relation of the different series over the overlapping

years. The high correlation during the overlap suggests that this procedure is
satisfactory.

—14—

Non—Filers and Unreported Income
The IRS data that we use refer to filed returns and to amounts included

in adjusted gross income. But, conceptually, our theory aflows for gaps between
a family's total income and the reported amount of adjusted gross income. Some of these

differences are legal, such as the exclusion from adjusted gross income of
non—taxable transfer payments, fringe benefits, some contributions to pension

plans, and parts of the income from interest or capital gains. Other exclusions are illegal, reflecting especially the unreported income from the under-

ground economy. However, the various exclusions from adjusted gross income
do not disturb the conclusion that the explicit marginal tax rate from the
schedule is the substitution variable that we wish to measure for each family.
If we could, we would change the weighting pattern from shares of adjusted

gross income to shares of a broader concept of income. But, if each family
filed an income—tax return, we would not want to make an overall adjustment
to account for the gap between the aggregates of adjusted gross and total income.

On the other hand, the data pick up only filed returns. Hence, we would
like to include the non—filers as families (and incomes) that face a zero marginal. tax rate. Therefore, we need estimates for each year of the numbers of
families

(and their incomes) who do not file tax returns.

a tax return, as is suggested by the high ratio of filed returns to numbers

will be too high by roughly a constant proportion.

According

to some recent research, the size of the underground economy in-

creased dramatically

during the 1970s.

See O'Neill (1982) for a discussion

and criticism of this work. Given this background, it is noteworthy that the
ratio of numbers of returns to numbers of households changes little in recent

years. If there had been a major increase in the importance of the underground
economy, then we would have expected to see a decline in this ratio. However,
the ratio would be sensitive only to variations in the numbers of families

whose full—time market activities are in the underground sector. Most people
who participate only on a

part—time basis would presumably file a tax

return.

For the years before 1947, we have reliable data on nubers of households only at

census dates. Also, the definition of a household varies over time. But, we
do know the

adult population (persons aged 18 and

over) for each year. Further,

the data that we have before 1950 suggest that the adult population proxies

sad.sorily through the late 1940s for the number of households. In particular,
the ratio of adult' population to the number of households is 2.74 in 1920, 2.68

in 1930, 2.63 in 1940, and 2.58

shows the ratio for each year of the number of tax returns filed

to the adult population (aged 18 and above). Notice that this ratio rises
sharply during World War II, which reflects a large decrease in the level of

—16—

income at which returns must be filed. But, the ratio is reasonably stable
since the war, varying between .50 and .58. In fact, most of the tendency
for the ratio to rise since the late 1940s can be explained by the decrease

in the ratio of adult population to the number of households7
The ratio of filed returns to adult population is only .05 in 1917, but
then rises because of the tax—law changes during World War I to reach .11 in

1920. After falling to about .05 between 1925 and 1935, the ratio rises to .09
in 1939. Then, the major increases in coverage during World War II raise the
ratio dramatically to .51 in 1945 and .53 in 1946. Subsequently, there are no
sharp changes in the ratio.

For

the period,

1916—45, we calculate the gap between the actual ratio for

mean ratio, .54, which applies from 1946 to 1980. Then, we

Numbers of returns and adjusted gross income are from Statistics of

and Statistical Abstract, various years
Personal
Income is from The National Income and Priict Accounts of the U.S.,
1929—76, and Economic Report of the President,_1982. Values for

for

clear trend.

Hence, we again make no adjustments for this period.

Before 1946, we calculate the gap for each year between the ratio of adjusted gross to personal income and the mean value, .79, which applies from

1946 to 1980. Then, we assume that this gap corresponds to the income——equivalent
to adjusted gross income——for those families that do not file returns. That is,

we estimate the total of adjusted gross income for each year by multiplying

aggregate personal income by .79. Then, we use this figure when we compute the
weights in the formula for average marginal tax rates (when weighted by amounts
of adjusted gross income).

Results for Average Marginal Tax Rates
Table 2 shows our time series of average marginal tax rates for 1916—80.
We present four sets of figures, depending on whether the weights are by adjusted gross income or numbers of returns, and on whether the arithmetic or

geometric averaging applies. Notice that the last consideration makes only a

small difference. However, the average marginal tax rates are much lower—by
as much as 10 percentage points in recent years——if the weighting is by numbers

of returns, rather than by income. The series that appear in Table 2 involve
some piecing together of different types of underlying data, as mentioned before.
We provide the details in the appendix.
Fpr most purposes, the time series weighted by income, rather than by numbers

of returns, will be more interesting. Then, since it makes little quantitative
difference and because the arithmetic procedure corresponds to usual index formu—
las, we focus our discussion now on the series shown in the first column of Table 2.
This series weights by adjusted gross income and uses the arithmetic form of average.
The top graph in Figure 1 shows these values of average marginal tax rates for

1916—80. The highlights are as follows.

Note: We discuss in the text the procedure for weighting by adjusted gross income
or by numbers of returns. The arithmetic indices have the form of equation
(11), while the geometric ones correspond to equatIon (13).
We use the tables from Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns
for each year, as discussed in the text. The appendix details the procedure for obtaining the figures in the middle periods (1944—60, 1978, when
weighted by adjusted gross income, and 1944—53, 1978, when weighted by
numbers of returns).

—21—

From a value of about 1% in 1916, the average marginal tax rate rises along
with major increases in the tax—rate schedule to a peak of 5% during World War I.
Then, because of a series of rate reductions through 1929 and the declines in
income for 1930—31, the marginal, rate falls to a low point of less than 2% in

1931. Subsequently, the rate rises sharply to reach 5% by 1936. Apparently, the
tax—rate increases between 1932 and 1936 reflect the Hoover—Roosevelt program for

fighting the Depression! In particular, for 1931, the marginal tax rates in the
schedule start at i½%, then rise to a top re of 25% for taxable incomes above $100,000.

But, in 1936, the rate starts at 4%, reaches 62% for taxable incomes above $100,000,
and hits a top rate of 79% for taxable incomes above $5 million.

From a value below 6% in 1940, the average marginal tax rate climbs to a

peak of 26% during World War II. These changes reflect three main elements:
first, reductions in the levels of income at which taxes are positive, second,
increases in the regular tax rates from the schedule, and third, special levies

fowar. Following World War II, the average marginal tax rate declines to a
low point of 18% in 1948—49.
After a peak of 25% during the Korean War, the average marginal tax rate

moves from 22% in 1954 to 25% in 1963. Then, the famous Kennedy—Johnson tax
cuts reduce the rate to 21% in 1965. Subsequently, the growth in nominal incomes

and the Vietnam surcharge raise the rate to 25—26% for 1968—69. Then,

following the removal of the surcharge, the effects of bracket creep increase

the rate steadily from 24% in 1971 to 31% in 1978. For 1979, the rate falls
to 29%, apparently because of a widening in the tax brackets, although there
are no changes in the lowest and highest tax rates.

But, for 1980 the average

marginal tax rate rises to 307..

The first column of Table 3 and the lower curve in Figure 1 show a simple

measure of an average tax rate. This rate is the ratio of total federal individual
income taxes to the aggregate of personal income. Because of the graduated—rate

—22—

structure of the tax law and the excess of personal over taxable income, we
anticipate that this type of average tax rate would be below our measure of the

average marginal tax rate. Also, while many changes in the tax law and in
incomes would generate correlated movements in the two measures of tax rates,
there are others——such as changes in deductibles versus changes in statutory

tax rates—that would produce substantial divergences.
Empirically, the average tax rate is 30 to 40% of our average marginal

rate 7% for 1916—79, 41% for 1946—79, and 39% for 1970—79). But, the bulk
of the movements in the two series are parallel. For 1916—79, the correlations
between the two are .99 in levels, but only .73 in first differences. For
1946—79, the comparable figures are .87 and .89. Some notable differences
between the series show up in recent years. For example, the average tax rates
for 1974 and 1977 are nearly the same, but the average marginal rate for 1977

is about 2½ percentage points higher. Then, the average tax rate hardly
changes from 1978 to 1979, but the average marginal rate falls by about 2 per-

centage points. Overall, for 1970—79, the correlation of the average marginal
tax rate with the average tax rate is .81 in levels, but only .39 iii

first

Table 3 shows also the average marginal tax rates that Joines (1981, Table 9)
calculates

for 1929—75. (We use his series that applies to the federal income

tax on labor income.) As noted earlier, Joines attempts to measure the marginal
relation of taxes to income, dTfdY . He carries this out by seeing how the
tax

paid per return changes with the adjusted gross income per return as we move

from one class of adjusted gross
both

income to

the next) Thus, he incorporates

the effects of the marginal tax rate from the schedule, T'

,

and the posi-

tive association of deductions per return with income per return. (Here, de—
ductions refer to the difference between adjusted gross and taxable income. The
gap between adjusted gross and total income is not considered, because of lack
of data.)

—23—

Not surprisingly, Joines's values are below our measures of average mar-

ginal tax rates. For example, for 1970—75, his figures average 86% of ours,
while for 1946—75 the percentage is 81%. The correlations of Joines's values
with ours for 1946—75 are .91 in levels and .88 in first differences. (Before
1946, the adjustment for non—filers means that our series and Joines's are not
directly comparable.)

Suppose now that we compare our average marginal tax rates (column 1 of
Table 2) with the average tax rates and Joines's values, which appear in Table 3.

Clearly, in terms of the levels of the numbers, it makes a great deal of differ-

ence which series one uses. However, because of the correlation among the series,
the choice may be less important for the purpose of time—series regression analysis.

But, there are substantial differences in the behavior of all three series over

time. Until we empoy these series for other purposes——for example, in explaining the behavior of aggregate output and employment——we cannot be sure how important these differences are:

The Dispersion of Marginal Tax Rates

We look now at the cross—sectional dispersion of marginal tax rates for

the recent period, 1961—77, 1979—80. For these years, we have the tables that
classify directly by the highest marginal tax rates. Figures 2—6 show the cumu—
lative density functions for the marginal tax rates for some selected years, 1961,

1965, 1970, 1975, and 1979. In each case the upper curve applies to numbers of
returns, while the lower one refers to amounts of adjusted gross income. For
example, for 1979, Figure 6 indicates that 65% of the returns and 33% of the
adjusted gross income are subject to marginal tax rates that are less than or
equal to 22%.

Iote: The average tax rate equals the ratio of total individual income taxes
(after credits) to the aggregate of personal income. The data on taxes
are from Statistics of Income, Individual Income Tax Returns for each
year. For personal income, see the notes to Table 1. The values for
dT/dY are from Joines (1981, Table 9, the column labeled PTL).

Note: The values for the means correspond to those in Table 2. Z
35% is
the fraction of adjusted gross income or numbers of returns for which
the marginal tax rate exceeds 35%. The data come from Statistics of
Income, Individual Tax Returns for each year, using the tables that
classify by marginal tax rates.

Table

4 shows for the period, 1961—77, 1979—80, the standard deviations of

the marginal tax rates about their arithmetic means, when weighted either by

adjusted gross income or by numbers of returns. When weighted by numbers of
returns, the standard deviation rises from .084 in 1967 to .125 in 1980.
ilowever, when weighted by adjusted gross income, this pattern shows up only

since 1973, where the increase is from .110 to .129.

We get a more interesting picture of dispersion when we look at the
fraction of incomes or returns for which the marginal tax rates are "high"——
that is, if we look at the weight in the upper tail of the cumulative densities

that appear in Figures 2—6. This exercise is interesting because some types of
tax—avoiding activities—such as exotic tax shelters and the heavy use of
currency for transactions—may become worthwhile only at very high marginal tax
rates. Then, in order to study these types of phenomena, we would be more interested in the weight in the upper tail of the marginal tax rate distribution,
rather than in the mean or standard deviation,

se.

Picking 35% arbitrarily as a high marginal tax rate, we see from Table 4
that there

have been dramatic increases in

or of numbers

the

fraction of adjusted gross income

of returns for which the marginal tax rate exceeds this number.

Specifically, the fraction of adjusted gross incomes for which the marginal
tax rate exceeds 35% falls from 9% in 1961 to 8% in 1964 (because of the Kennedy—
Johnson tax cuts), but then rises to 12% in 1970, 18% in 1975, and 31% in 1980.

In other words, the fraction of income that faces a marginal tax rate of at least

35% quadruples from 1964 to 1980! With respect to numbers of returns, the
fraction falls from 1.2% in 196]. to 1.0% in 1964, but then increases to 2.2% in

1970, 4.1% in 1975 and 10.1% in 1980. Hence, the fraction of returns that faces
these high marginal tax rates rises by a factor of ten from 1964 to 1980.

—27—

Bob Hall suggests (in private conversation) that the rapid rise in $100
bills in recent years may relate to the sharp increase in the fraction of income

that faces high marginal tax rates. (Others have suggested the growth in
criminal activity as a cause.) In particular, the fraction of the value of
all currency that is in denominations of $100 or greater is highly stable—

varying only between 20% and 22%——from 1944 to l97O. But, the fraction then
increases sharply to reach 36% for July 1980 and 39% for July 1982.

The Behavior of Deductions
Figures 7—10 show the cross—sectional relation of deductions per return to
adjusted gross income per return (for all filing statuses) for the years, 1961,

1965, 1970 and 1975. Here, deductions, which refer to the differences between
adjusted gross and taxable incone, include exemptions, but exclude the various
subtractions from total income that precede the calculation of adjusted gross

income. The figures consider the range of adjusted gross income per return up
to $70,000.

The data do not suggest much tendency for the slope, dD/dY

,

to

change

with income, once adjusted gross income exceeds a fairly low amount, which

is

$5,000——$1O,000 between 1961 and 1975.21 In fact, this appearance of a roughly
linear relation between deductions and adjusted gross income holds up if we add
the upper tail of income.

(At the low end, the slope decreases with adjusted

gross income.) For the years shown in the figures, which range from 1961 to
1975, and for values of adjusted gross income that exceed $10,000, the estimated

slopes, dD/dY ,

are

in the interval between .16 and .18. That is, once ad-

justed gross income is greater than $5,000——$1O,000, deductions per return are

In

fact, for the post—World War II period,

this relation accounts for most of the difference in average levels between

Joines's estimates of dT/dY (see Table 3) and our figures on average marginal
tax rates. For 1970—75, his values average 86Z of ours, while for 1946—75, they
are 81% of ours.

Concluding Remarks
Our time series on average marginal tax rates should be useful for a variety

of research purposes. But, our own plans——and our initial motivation for constructing the series——focus on two areas. First, we plan to use the data on
average marginal tax rates in a study of the effects of government policies

on aggregate output, employment, and so on. Some previous work on this topic
stresses the influences of monetary disturbances and of various types of govern-

ment purchases. (See, for example, Barro, 1981) Now, we can add a measure of
the average marginal tax rate to assess this aspect of fiscal policy. Conceivably, we may also be able to distinguish temporary changes in marginal tax rates
from permanent ones. Then, the temporary changes involve intertemporal—substitution
effects, which do not arise for the permanent changes.

Hence, we can test for a

—29—

different

impact of temporary versus permanent shifts in marginal tax

rates on output, employment, and other macroeconomic variables.

Second, a theory of public—debt creation, outlined in Barro (1979), in-

cludes the intertemporal behavior of tax rates. Specifically, this theory
suggests that debt management smooths

tax rates over time, in spite of

fluctuations in government spending and aggregate real income. In order to
test this theory fully, we need the time—series data on average marginal tax
rates.

Finally, as mentioned before, the present series on average marginal tax
rate8 is incomplete because it refers only to the federal individual income tax.

We plan some extensions, at least to incorporate the social security tax and

some other levies. At this point, we are uncertain about how far we can go

constructing a

comprehensive measure of the average marginal tax rate.

Footnotes
1Protopapadakis (1982) also uses the Joines—Seater approach to calculate

average marginal tax rates for capital—gain income. Earlier, Wright (1969)
uses the explicit rates from the tax schedule to calculate average marginal

tax rates for interest and dividends over the period, 1913—58. Except for
his weighting by amounts of interest and dividend income, Wright's approach
seems to accord with the one that we emphasize in this paper.

2The

important considerations are first, distinguishing the self—employed

from employees; second, allowing for the tax—deductibility of employer contribu-

tions; and third, ascertaining the fraction of persons (and their incomes) whose
earnings exceed the ceiling amount. Joines (1981, p. 199) estimates the last
element from the distribution of labor income per return from the IRS data.

But, this procedure is unsatisfactory, at least for families with more than one
income earner. However, the appropriate data are available directly from the
-Social

Security Administration. A more difficult issue concerns the extra bene-

fits that people get when they "contribute" more to social security. The marginal
benefit shouid be subtracted from the payments to compute a net marginal tax

rate. But, these calculations—which depend on anticipated benefit schedules—
may be difficult.

Some other credits can effectively be combined with deductions in our subsequent

5The function,

f(X) ,

would not be concave throughout if there were

set—up costs associated with producing deductions. At the low end of incomes,
there is non—concavity because of the standard deduction, which is an effort—
free alternative to itemized deductions.

function, Y F(L , B) , where B is "business expenses," which could
include the costs of moving. These business expees then appear also in the

function that generates deductions • In this formulation the marginal product of

labor replaces the wage, w , in equations (7) and (8). We also get the optimiza—

reasons that we mentioned before). If this marginal effect on deductions is
positive (negative), then the effectiye marginal tax rate is below (above) T'

12Recall that we have abstracted from saving——hence, the effect of
in equation tl0) reflects only the substitution between market goods and leisure.
Possibly, individuals perceive their current marginal tax rates as permanent, so
that the main intertemporal—substitution effects do not arise.

13Recall that we neglect the earned—income credit, which applies since 1975

for taxpayers who have a dependent child. For 1981, the credit rises by lOZ of
earned income up to a total earned income of $5,000. Hence, the marginal tax

rate is —1OZ over this range. (People with negative taxes receive money from the
government.) Then, the credit is constant until earned income equals $6,000, but

—33—

falls by 123% of earned income up to a total of $10,000. In this range someone's

marginal tax rate is

12½Z plus the explicit rate from the tax

schedule.

(For incomes above $10,000, the credit stays at zero.) The amount of earned—
income credit depends also (negatively) on the quantity of unearned income.

14We also make an adjustment for alternative—tax computations.

15We have interesting problems for 1942 and 1943, which involve.' the

introduction of tax withholding with the legislation of January 1943. In
order to avoid the payment of two years' worth of taxes in 1943, the govern-

ment forgave roughly 75% of the tax liability for the year——either 1942 or 1943—

this provision was foreseen when people earned their incomes in 1942. In any
event, our calculations for 1942 and 1943 use the explicit tax—rate schedules,
which disregard the effects of tax forgiveness.

1980.

18Note that personal income includes only a small amount of unreported
income, which comes from estimates by the IRS. (For a discussion, see
O'Neill (1982, pp. 2, ff.).) Therefore, we cannot use the ratio of adjusted.
gross to personal income in order to infer the behavior of unreported income.

19Joines's values also weight by the estimated fraction of total labor
income

in each income class,

rather than by adjusted gross income.

the relation between itemized deductions per return and adjusted gross income per return is again roughly linear for values of adjusted gross income

Appendix

Table Al shows estimates of average marginal tax rates for 1944—78,

based on the tables that classify by ranges of adjusted gross income per

return. We indicated in the text our procedure for estimating the marginal

tax rate

within each class. Then, we weight either by adjusted gross in-

come or be numbers of returns and

use

either the arithmetic or geometric

formula to generate the figures shown in the table.
We use the values in Table Al to fill in our missing data as follows.

For the cases where we weight by adjusted gross income, we get the arithmetic
values for 1944—60 from the equation, —.021 +

l.093•(value

from Table Al).

The coefficients come from a regression of the values shown in Table 2 on

those shown in Table Al over the period, 1961—70. For the geometric form,
we use the equation, —.020 + l.07l (value from Table Al). En both cases the

a2
-

values for the regressions are nearly .99. For 1978, we get the arithmetic

value from the equation —.019 + L.l12.(value

from Table A].). These coeffi-.

dents come from a regression over the period, 1971—77. Similarly, for the
geometric value, we use the equation, —.005 +

l.045.(value

from Table Al).

En these cases the values of R2 are .98.
We use an analogous procedure for the cases where we weight by numbers of

returns. Here, we get the missing data for 1944-53 by using regression equations
that are estimated over the period, 1954—70. For the arithmetic case, the
equation is —.004 +
