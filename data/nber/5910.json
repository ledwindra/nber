    "abstract": "\n\nThis paper describes two databases dealing with world bilateral trade flows: the World Trade Database (WTDB) assembled by Statistics Canada, which contains bilateral trade flows for all countries over 1970-1992, classified according to the Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 2 (with some modification); and the Compatible Trade and Production (COMTAP) database assembled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which contains production of manufactured goods in OECD countries and bilateral trade flows between these countries and all their trading partners over 1970-1985, classified according to the International Standard Industrial Classification, Revision 2.  These databases are available to academic users on the CD-ROM.  Also contained on the CD-ROM is information on country factor endowments, tariff and non-tariff barriers for selected countries, and input-output tables for the United Kingdom and the United States.  The WTDB database is made available under a license with Statistics Canada, the terms of which are described herein, and the COMTAP database is made available by permission of the OECD. \n A revised  version of this data set is available on CD-ROM.\n\n",
