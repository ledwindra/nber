    "abstract": "\n\nWhat is the impact of male and female alumni speaker interventions in introductory microeconomics courses on student interest in economics? Using student-level transcript data, we estimate the effect of speakers on future course-taking in models which use untreated lectures as control groups, including professor and semester fixed effects and student-level covariates. Alumni speakers increase intermediate economics course take-up by 2.1 percentage points (11%). Students are more responsive to same-gender speakers, with male speakers increasing men\u2019s course take-up by 36% and female speakers increasing women\u2019s course take-up by 40%, implying that the effect of alumni speakers is strongly gendered.\n\n",
