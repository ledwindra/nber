JEL No. C81,D31,D63,J15,J31
ABSTRACT
This paper presents income shares, income inequality, and income immobility measures for all
race and ethnic groups in the United States using the universe of U.S. tax returns matched at the
individual level to U.S. Census race data for 2000–2014. Whites and Asians have a
disproportionately large share of income in top quantiles. Income for most race groups ranges
between 50–80 percent of the corresponding White income level consistently across various
percentiles in the overall income distribution—suggesting that class alone cannot explain away
overall income differences. The rate of income growth at the 90th percentile exceeds that of the
50th and 10th percentiles for all race and ethnic groups; divergence is largest for Whites,
however, in the post-Great Recession era. Income immobility is largest for the highest-income
races. Overall, these results paint a picture of a rigid income structure by race and ethnicity over
time.

Introduction

Race matters for economic and social outcomes. In the U.S., persistent di↵erences exist across racial and
ethnic groups in wages, employment, home ownership, arrests, and health outcomes. For example, the BlackWhite male earnings ratio has stagnated at 0.8 after decades of convergence (Lang, Kevin and Lehmann, Jee
and Yeon, K, 2012); Black life expectancy is approximately four years shorter than for Whites; and Black
infant mortality rates are higher relative to Whites by 140 percent (Boustan and Margo, 2012). Homicide
arrests have not dropped below a Black-White ratio of seven (LaFree et al., 2010), and Black-White home
ownership di↵ered by about 23 percentage points as recently as 2007 (Collins and Margo, 2011). Even after
controlling for compositional di↵erences such as ability, experience, or educational attainment and quality,
disparities do not completely disappear across race and ethnic groups (Altonji and Blank, 1999; Carruthers
and Wanamaker, 2017; Darity and Mason, 1998; Ritter and Taylor, 2011; Black et al., 2006; Ramraj et al.,
2016; Fryer Jr, 2011; Bayer and Charles, 2016; Juhn et al., 1991, 1993; Neal and Johnson, 1996; Bound and
Freeman, 1992).1
While there is mounting evidence that race matters in a series of important economic contexts, one
area that has received relatively little attention along race and ethnic lines is the recent rise in income
inequality in the U.S. There have been significant e↵orts in recent years to identify and explain increased
income inequality and reduction in income mobility for the general population. However, none of that work
has focused on di↵erences by individual race or ethnicity (Piketty and Saez, 2003; Chetty et al., 2014; Kopczuk
et al., 2010). When a researcher uses administrative records from the Social Security Administration or from
tax filings in isolation, he or she cannot evaluate on how inequality varies between or within race and ethnic
groups. As a result, understanding racial and ethnic income inequality and mobility continues to be one of
the more important unaddressed questions in economics.2
Correctly identifying changes in income inequality and income mobility by race matter for economic
policy and analysis. Anti-poverty policies hinge on concerns regarding the di↵erential resources of race and
1 In the relatively few cases when di↵erences are explained, the explanatory variables—such as employment opportunities,
educational opportunities, or household characteristics—are often highly correlated with race and ethnicity. In these cases, premarket conditions suggest disparities in access to or quality of educational institutions; these disparities are highly correlated
with race and ethnicity and may simply imply an explanation for disparities, predating entry into the labor market, that are
still race- or ethnicity-based.
2 Measures of income inequality are meaningful on their own and may determine other economic outcomes. For example,
inequality may drive racial residential segregation (Reardon and Bischo↵, 2011) and may reduce the incentive to invest in
higher education (Kearney and Levine, 2016). There is also some evidence that inequality may reduce the societal support for
public assistance programs (Ashok et al., 2015). Violent crimes may also be causally related to high levels of income inequality
(Kennedy et al., 1998; Fajnzylber et al., 2002). Income inequality may also a↵ect adult health outcomes with a lag (Subramanian
and Kawachi, 2004). In tight housing markets, increased income inequality may more than proportionately a↵ect the poor,
who have to pay more for housing (Matlack and Vigdor, 2008). Kawachi et al. (1997) finds that increasing income inequality
reduces investment in social capital, which then increases adult mortality. Related to this, Hout (2016) finds that higher levels
of inequality reduce happiness.

ethnic groups, yet we do not have a solid picture of these groups’ resources relative to majority Whites across
time. Data limitations mask the experiences of some of the most economically marginalized populations in
the U.S., such as American Indians and Pacific Islanders. Additionally, treating the large race and ethnic
groups as homogeneous may ignore important changes at the extreme ends of these populations and hide
emerging concerns (or successes). These have important policy consideration in terms of migration, social
welfare programs, housing, health, and education.
We are the first to conduct an analysis of income inequality and mobility by race and ethnic origin using
data that include, first, an administrative source of income for the population of U.S. tax filers (amounting to
more than 100 million observations each year); second, the race and ethnic origin of each observation; third,
a long continuous time frame (15 years) over which we can track individual income trajectories; and fourth,
income data that is not top-coded or otherwise censored. While some economists have used survey data,
such as the Survey of Consumer Finance, to examine the long-run trends in income and asset inequality for
the U.S. (Keister, 2000; Kochhar and Fry, 2014), because of small sample sizes for certain race and ethnic
groups, researchers often only focus on inequality measures for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics (Bloome and
Western, 2011; McKernan et al., 2015; DeBacker et al., 2013). Such research is limited in that it potentially
obscures di↵erent patterns of inequality for smaller racial and ethnic groups. Sociologists, to some extent,
have examined income inequality by race, but such work has been limited to only two or three large groups
due to sample size constraints or to cross-sectional analyses using U.S. Census decennial data (Bloome, 2014;
Bloome and Western, 2011; Reardon and Bischo↵, 2011; Snipp and Cheung, 2016). Additional problems
exist with survey data beyond the relatively small sample sizes for ethnic and racial minorities. There are
well-known measurement issues with income reported in survey data that can distort measures of inequality.3
Moreover, since panel data is necessary to study income mobility, few studies exist that examine di↵erence
by race beyond comparisons of White and Black di↵erences in mobility patterns (Bloome, 2014).
We overcome the usual data limitations by using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax data linked
at the person level to U.S. Census Bureau race and Hispanic origin data. Because these data cover more
than 90 percent of the universe of working-age tax filers in the U.S. in each year of our study, we are able to
report on income inequality and mobility across previously unreported groups and to measure the di↵erential
experience between and within all race and ethnic groups. We also create a panel data set at the individual
level for all tax filers over our 15-year period. In looking at our defined race and ethnic groups (White, Black,
3 First, survey respondents at the lower end of the income distribution tend to over-report their earnings while those at the
higher end tend to under-report (Pedace and Bates, 2000; Meyer and Mittag, 2015). Second, income non-response rates in
surveys are both high and not randomly distributed across respondents.

American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Other, and Hispanic4 ), we
document significant racial and ethnic income inequality in the midst of overall increasing income inequality
in the U.S.
We have three main findings. Whites tend to have a disproportionately large share of income in top
quantiles, while all other races accrue a disproportionately large share of income at the bottom 10 percent
and 1 percent of the overall income distribution. Blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics are consistently
at the low end of the total income distribution compared to Whites, Asians, and those in the Other group.
Pacific Islanders tend to fall in between the two extremes. Most race groups (with the exception of Asians)
range between 50 percent and 80 percent of the corresponding White income level consistently across various
percentiles in the income distribution. This suggests that race di↵erences persist regardless of skill attainment
and within-group income distributions, indicating that race and ethnicity “matter” beyond class distinctions.
Our second novel finding is that the rate of income growth at the 90th percentile exceeds the rate of
growth at the 50th percentile for all race and ethnic groups suggesting a divergence in income inequality in
the top half of the income distribution. At the bottom of the income distribution we find that the growth
of income at the 50th percentile matched the rate of growth at 10th percentile and there is little increase in
income inequality there over time. One exception is for Whites—we find that there is an increase in income
inequality due to a steady decrease in the level of income at the 10th percentile. These results indicate that
the top part of the income distribution is diverging away from the rest of the income quantiles and—to a
lesser extent—for many groups the middle part of the income distribution is diverging away from the bottom.
This is a general result that persists across most race and ethnic groups; however, it is the most pronounced
for Whites.We find for Blacks that there is a slight reduction in income inequality at the bottom half of the
income distribution driven primarily by an increase in income thresholds for the 10th percentile over time.
One should not take this, necessarily, as a good sign since there are still large absolute di↵erences in the
income at the 10th percentile for Blacks as compared to the 10th percentile for Whites it is only $9,061 for
Blacks but it is $13,914 for Whites.
The third finding is that income mobility decreased for all race and ethnic groups between 2000
and 2014. We observe a decrease in income mobility after the Great Recession and find that there is a
convergence in overall immobility for all race and ethnic groups. Levels of income mobility are low and of a
4 The U.S. Census Bureau adheres to the Office of Management and Budget’s 1997 race and ethnicity standards, which specify
five major race groups: White, Black or African American (“Black” here), American Indian or Alaska Native (“American Indian”
or “AIAN” here), Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (“Pacific Islander” or “NHPI” here), and define two
ethnic groups (Hispanic and non-Hispanic). For our study, we define each race group as that race alone and non-Hispanic,
except for Other, which includes non-Hispanic multiple race respondents as well as people who reported Some Other Race.

similar magnitude to those found by other researchers using historical data (Kopczuk et al., 2010). Whites
and Asians experienced less within-group mobility relative to other groups. On the other hand, an analysis
using rank correlation indicates that Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians are more immobile than other
groups when rank is calculated from the overall distribution. There are noticeable di↵erences across groups
in mobility over time. Asians and Whites exhibit higher mobility in a transition matrix analysis compared
with Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians have a higher
probability of experiencing downward mobility compared to Whites and Asians. Together, these results
paint a picture of a rigid income structure, where Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians may move within
their own income distributions but still are stuck at the bottom overall.
Overall this paper provides detailed evidence for an entrenchment in income across races and ethnicities in the US for the past two decades. Not only are disproportionately large amounts of income accruing
to the top end of the income distribution, it is also accruing disproportionately to a few race groups. Within
race groups, the di↵erence between the top and bottom incomes has been widening with a significant divergence for Whites especially in the past few years. Finally, we document that income immobility is high and
fairly consistent for all race and ethnic groups in the US. These details belie key beliefs within the U.S. that
a person can “get ahead” regardless of race and ethnic origin, and that race doesn’t matter independently
from class.
The paper proceeds as follows: The next section provides information on the data sets used in our
analysis and the process of linking these data. In section 3, we provide descriptive evidence documenting the
patterns of income inequality and income shares across racial and ethnic groups. Section 4 reports estimates
of both within-group income mobility and group-specific income mobility for the entire income distribution.
Section 5 concludes. We also provide a data appendix that includes further analysis and robustness checks on
the main data selection choices. These checks include analyses that use linked W-2 data and the population
of working-age men in the 2000 and 2010 censuses.

Data Set Description and Data Linkage

We use restricted-use data in our study. The data come from two separate sources: the U.S. Census Bureau
and the IRS. Records are linked at the U.S. Census Bureau using a process whereby individuals in each data
set were given a unique, protected identification key, called a PIK. When a Social Security Number (SSN)
is available in a data set, the identifier is assigned based on SSN. For records without an SSN, personally

5

identifiable information such as name, address, and date of birth is used in probabilistic matching to assign
PIKs.5 Personal information is then removed from each data set before they may be used for research
purposes. Only those observations that received the unique person identifier are used in the analysis.
It is important to note that the record-linkage approach we use to link the data introduces some
bias. Minorities and people with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive a record-linkage key
compared to Whites and people who have higher levels of socioeconomic status (Bond et al., 2014). Given
that our analysis focuses on income inequality and immobility, this di↵erence in likelihood would result in
downward bias of any estimates of inequality and immobility between race and ethnic groups. While we
demonstrate that we cover the vast majority of working-age tax filers in our study in tables that follow,
we do caution that our results may underestimate this population’s inequality and immobility by race and
ethnicity for the study period. It is likely that the non-matches between the IRS and the Census race and
ethnicity data are among low-income individuals and minorities.6
The Census data, referred to here as “race and ethnicity” data or information, is a multi-year data
set that combines the 2000 and 2010 decennial censuses with ACS data from 2001 to 2014. These data
were combined specifically to capture race and Hispanic origin reported by U.S. households. We selected
the reported race and Hispanic origin from the most-recent decennial census file when available for each
individual. We then selected the most recent ACS race and Hispanic origin response for individuals who did
not have a race or ethnicity response in one of the decennial censuses.
We link the race and ethnicity file to 2000 to 2014 Form 1040 data. We use Adjusted Gross Income
(AGI) for our analyses, which includes all sources of income for a tax unit and all adjustments to income.
Unlike previous inequality research that uses tax data and examines the top end of the income distribution,
we do not have separate fields for di↵erent income sources, and thus lack the ability to partition out market
income. This should matter less for looking at the entire distribution of tax filers, however, since for most
tax filers, the main source of income is wage earnings. Another way in which we di↵er from previous research
is in our unit of analysis, which is the individual rather than the tax unit. We chose to examine primary
and secondary filers separately for several reasons. First, because we wish to examine individual income
trajectories over time, we want to capture filers who may file as married in some years and unmarried in
others. Second, married filers may be of di↵erent races or ethnicities, and removing spouses from the sample
of filers may bias our estimates. This is especially true if married filers of a given race or ethnicity are more

examine those with W-2 data and all men of working age from the decennial censuses in the appendix to assess how
much bias may be induced by examining only tax filers.

likely to be the primary filer. Last, in using every primary and secondary filer, we can examine a weighted
measure of AGI that reflects the true resources accruing to each filer.
Specifically, we create a file that lists each primary and secondary Form 1040 filer separately, and
then remove any filers who are claimed as dependents on another filer’s Form 1040. Using the number of
dependents reported on the form and the number of adults reflected in the filing status, we calculate the
number of persons in the tax unit for each primary and secondary filer. Then we multiply each filer’s AGI by
an equivalency scale suggested by Citro et al. (1995), which weights income using the adults and children in
a household.7 Additionally, in line with previous research, we have restricted our universe to the working-age
population—those aged 25 to 65 in a tax year—and those with AGI greater than or equal to zero.
To assess the representativeness of our data, we separately matched the 2010 Census data for people
ages 25 to 65 to the 2010 Form 1040s. This matched data set can be considered a point-in-time assessment
of the quality of the match. It should be emphasized that PIK assignment on the Form 1040 data is based
on SSN, and thus the rate of PIK assignment is close to 100 percent. As shown in Table 1, the matched
data contain higher proportions of Whites and Asians and lower proportions of the other race and ethnic
groups in our study compared with 2010 Census (Column f). Lower match rates for certain groups in our
data are due not only to the slightly lower likelihood of receiving a PIK compared with Whites and Asians,
but also due to lower participation in the labor force and in income tax filing for these groups.8 Blacks and
American Indians, as well as Hispanics and Pacific Islanders, have lower incomes compared to Whites and
Asians (Ramakrishnan and Ahmad, 2014) and thus may be less likely to file taxes compared to these groups.
Our universe has similar proportions of people ages 25 to 44 and 45 to 65, and we match more women than
we do men (indicating both that women are more likely than men to be either a primary or secondary filer
and that women are more likely to receive a PIK).
Because race and ethnicity information is not available on the 1040s, it is impossible to know how
well we match certain lower-income groups contingent on filing a 1040. However, we are able to compare our
final number of matched tax filers to publicly available data to assess how much of the tax-filing population
we capture. These data were available from 2010 forward from the Statistics of Income (SOI) division of
the IRS. Table 2 indicates that we cover about 94 to 96 percent of the tax-filing population (Column c).
One explanation for why the numbers of observations in our linked data are lower each year than the SOI
estimates is that the SOI estimates include U.S. citizens working abroad, while our linked data represent

and K = the number of children (Citro et al., 1995).

the U.S. resident population.9 When we further restrict the data to filers with AGI greater than or equal to
zero, our capture rates decrease to between 91 and 93 percent (Column f).10
Overall, our data provide several improvements and advantages to existing data used to estimate
income inequality and immobility by race and ethnicity. Our data are large enough that we are able to
identify all of the major race and ethnic categories in the U.S. Additional problems exist with survey data
beyond the relatively small sample sizes for ethnic and racial minorities. There are well-known measurement
issues with income reported in survey data that can distort measures of inequality. First, survey respondents
at the lower end of the income distribution tend to over-report their earnings while those at the higher end
9 Estimates of Americans living and working abroad range from 2.2 to 6.8 million people (Costanzo and von Koppenfels,
2013). When we subtract 2.2 and 6.8 million people from the SOI estimates, our universe coverage rates of the SOI estimates
increase to between 95 and 100 percent compared to 94 and 96 percent.
10 Comparing 2010 1040s and W-2s matched to the 2010 Census also helps us assess the representativeness of our universe.
W-2s cover the distribution of wage earners with the exception of the self-employed. We find that 1040s cover more people ages
25 to 65 in the 2010 Census compared with W-2s. Each race group has a higher number of people in the 2010 Census-1040
matched universe relative to the 2010 Census-W-2 matched universe. While the race distributions are generally similar between
both universes, the proportion of Blacks in the matched 2010 Census-1040 universe is lower relative to W-2s, and the proportion
of Asians and Hispanics is slightly higher in the 2010 Census–1040 universe. This further supports the suitability of our data
for this analysis. Our universe contains a higher proportion of women relative to men, while the W-2 universe covers slightly
more men. This higher coverage of females in our universe is likely in part because we are capturing women who are out of the
labor force, but married to a spouse who is earning income and filing income tax. Our W-2 analysis is available upon request.
In the Appendix to this paper, we perform an analysis in which we add W-2 nonfilers to our analytic data from 2005 to 2014.

tend to under-report (Pedace and Bates, 2000; Meyer and Mittag, 2015). Second, income non-response rates
in surveys are both high and not randomly distributed across respondents. For example, annual earnings
non-response rates in the Current Population Survey (CPS) and American Community Survey (ACS) are
close to 20 percent, and non-response rates are highest for extreme high- and low-earner households (Bollinger
et al., 2014). The resulting bias understates earnings inequality (Bollinger et al., 2014, 2015).
We also have a distinct advantage with our data that we are able to create a panel data set at the
individual level to evaluate income mobility by race and ethnicity. Assessing income mobility requires having
measures of income for the same individual at multiple points in time, making it even more difficult to study
income mobility for all race and ethnic groups using survey or unlinked administrative records. To our
knowledge, no studies to date evaluate income mobility using data linked at the individual level for all race
and ethnic groups in the U.S. for the current time period.

Income Shares and Inequality Measures by Race and Ethnicity

In this section, we describe the distribution of income data by race and ethnic groups for two periods in
our time frame: for 2000 and for 2014 (in 2014 dollars). Previous research has shown that incomes are

9

increasingly concentrated in the top decile of earners, with the highest concentration occurring in the top
tenth of one percent (Piketty and Saez, 2003).11 These results mark a shift from the compression of wages
in the middle of the 20th century, which brought inequality to its lowest levels in U.S. history (Goldin and
Margo, 1992). Given the detailed nature of our data, we can provide several measures that outline the
evolution of income inequality and the concentration of income to di↵erent parts of the distribution. We
measure income at the individual level as discussed previously, using income equivalency weights to account
for household composition.

3.1

Income Distribution and Income Shares

In Figures 1 and 2, we provide the kernel density estimate of income for our seven race and ethnic groups
for 2000 and 2014 (in 2014 dollars). In order to show the main part of the distribution on a single graph, we
present income by group for those reporting between $0 and $200,000 in AGI. The White group is the most
right skewed of the densities in the figures, and the mass for this distribution is significantly to the right of
all of the other race and ethnic groups, which indicates that they had the highest average (and median and
mode) incomes. The Asian category also has a rightward skew, but not to as large a degree as do Whites.
The Asian category also has clustering at the far left of the distribution, suggesting greater inequality within
the Asian category relative to Whites.
The remaining five groups (Hispanic, Black, American Indian, Pacific Islander, and Other) all tend
to be clustered at the far left of the income distribution. The masses of those distributions are centered
below approximately $25,000. Generally, for most groups the income distribution patterns are similar in
2000 and 2014. Notably, however, we find an increase in the number of Asians in the upper end of the
income distribution between 2000 and 2014. There is also a moderate increase of the number of Hispanics
in the middle income range between 2000 to 2014.
The mean AGI for our entire universe shows similar patterns. Whites had the highest mean AGI
at $61,565 in 2000, followed by Asians at $58,444. In contrast, the mean AGI for Hispanics, Blacks, and
American Indians was in the low $30,000s. The Other group and Pacific Islanders fall in between these
high-income and low-income groups. Generally, the mean AGI across groups remained stable from 2000 to
2014, with the exception of the mean AGI for Asians, which increased to $64,369 in 2014, surpassing the
11 There are a number of studies in the literature that use administrative data to measure income inequality in the U.S.,
especially the growth of the top percentiles. Recent work by Piketty and Saez (2003) identifies the increasing share of total
income that has gone to the top income deciles in the last few decades. Feenberg and Poterba (2000) find an increase in the
fraction of income accruing to the top 0.5 percent using U.S. IRS tax data over the period 1960–1995. In the latter analysis,
the authors examine Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) measured in three di↵erent ways (including and excluding capital gains and
statutory gains). All of the recent research confirms an increase in income inequality since the 1970s.

We next decompose the total share of income accruing to the top 10 percent, 1 percent, and 0.1
percent of the income distribution, as well as the income shares going to the bottom 10 percent and 1
percent. Piketty and Saez (2003) show that the proportion of income accruing to the top percentiles of
the income distribution has been steadily increasing over the past few decades. Our analysis in this section
identifies whether those at the top and bottom segments of the income distribution were proportionate to
their group’s share in the total population.
In Table 3, we show the share of income for the di↵erent income percentiles for 2000 and 2014.12 The
share of income accruing to the top 10 percent of the population of all tax filers was about 41 percent in 2000
and 40 percent in 2014. Looking across the columns for 2000, about 90 percent of the income that accrued
to the top 10 percent of the income distribution of tax filers went to Whites, while about 2.5 percent went to
Hispanics, 2.1 percent to Blacks, 0.25 percent to American Indians, and 5.3 percent to Asians. At the bottom
of the panel, we report the proportion of the population of each of these groups for our restricted sample
of tax filers ages 25 to 65. Comparing the share of the population to the share of income accruing to each
group provides an additional measure of inequality. Whites received a strongly disproportionate share of top
income, while Asians received slightly more than their proportionate share. Meanwhile Hispanics, Blacks,
American Indians, Pacific Islanders, and Others accrued less than their proportionate share of total income
in the top 10 percent. Looking at Panel B, there are noticeable changes over time: The share accruing to
Whites decreased to about 84 percent and the share for Hispanics increased to 4 percent. However, the
proportion of Whites in the population decreased to about 70 percent, while Hispanics increased to about
13 percent. Asians realized an increase to an 8 percent share while Blacks, American Indians, and Pacific
Islanders did not realize any noticeable changes at the top 10 percent over this time period.
The next row provides a similar analysis for the top 1 percent of the income distribution of tax filers.
Compared to the preceding row, inequality is even more pronounced at this percentile of the distribution.
Examining the portion accruing to the various race and ethnic groups indicates that the share that went
to Hispanics, Blacks, American Indians, and Pacific Islanders is smaller in percent terms than for the top
10 percent. In other words, there is even more inequality across race and ethnic groups at the uppermost
ends of the income distribution. Changes over time indicate a similar pattern to the top 10 percent: Groups
besides White and Pacific Islander improved their share while also increasing their representation in the
12 Appendix Table 1 shows the population distribution and top and bottom shares for every year of our data. Patterns of
change roughly hold true when looking at every year rather than the first and last year, but interesting patterns can be observed
for before, during, and after the Great Recession; future research intends to follow up on these di↵erences.

population.
The results for the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution indicate an even larger proportion
accruing to a much smaller share of the population. Once again, Whites have the largest portion of the
income share at this income percentile compared with their share of the population. Patterns are similar to
the previous row, and changes over time exhibit the same trade-o↵ in income and population shares.
For the bottom 10 percent and bottom 1 percent of the income distribution, only about 1 percent
of the total income in the U.S. is accrued in each year. Whereas the top 10 percent received about four
times their proportionate share of total income, the bottom 10 percent received about one-tenth of their
proportionate share. The proportions of income accruing to the various race and ethnic groups indicates
that Whites received less than their proportionate share while Hispanics, Blacks, American Indians, Pacific
Islanders, and Others received more than their proportionate shares. Asians also received more than their
proportionate share of income at the bottom of the overall distribution than their share of population
would suggest. This group received more than its proportionate share at both the top and bottom income
percentiles, suggesting strong heterogeneity within this group. The next rows provide the income share
accruing to the bottom 1 percent. The share accruing to Hispanic and Black was lower than in the previous

13

panel and the share going to Whites was somewhat larger but still less than proportionate to their population
share.
In terms of overall inequality, comparing 2000 to 2014 indicates a slight decrease in income shares
at the very top (the top 1 and 0.1 percent). However, this is o↵set by a decrease in income shares at the
bottom of the distribution. For example, for the bottom 10 percent, the income share decreased from 1.20
percent to 1.00 percent; the bottom 1 percent’s share decreased from 0.02 to 0.01. This loss of resources at
the lowest end of the distribution is consistent with analyses presented in Section 3.4, which indicate a rise
in inequality over the time period.
In Figures 3 and 4 we present the same information in a slightly di↵erent manner, showing the relative
size of the shares of top and bottom income percentiles. In Figure 3 we plot the share of income that accrued
to the top 10 percent of the income distribution in 2000 (the open marker) and again in 2014 (the closed
marker) for each race and ethnic group. The red vertical line at 1 indicates parity—this would indicate that
a race or ethnic group received exactly the share of the top 10 percent that is proportionate to their share
of the overall population. For Whites, for example, the two markers are to the right of the red vertical line,
indicating that Whites receive more than their proportional share of income in the top 10 percent of the
distribution. The other race and ethnic groups tend to be below parity and, in particular, below the 0.5
ratio. One exception is the Other race group, which went from below parity in 2000 to slightly above parity
in 2014. The most striking result, however, is for Asians; this group starts above parity in 2000 and ends up
at almost double their population share by 2014.
Figure 4 provides a view of the opposite end of the income distribution. Whites are under-represented
in the bottom 10 percent of the income distribution as their proportion in the overall population would
predict. This has not changed much over the 14 years, however, relative to the other races and groups. The
remaining race and ethnic groups tend to always be above parity for the bottom of the income distribution.
In this regard, only Asian and the Other Race group is above parity at both the top and bottom 10 percent
portions of the income distribution, suggesting strong heterogeneity within these two groups.

3.2

Percentile Parity Results by Race and Year

An alternative method to present di↵erences across race and ethnic groups is to show a comparison of
the actual dollar incomes that mark the 20th, 40th, and other percentiles for each race and ethnic group
compared to Whites. In the next five figures (Figures 5–9), we plot the annual dollar threshold for selected
percentiles in the within-group income distributions for all groups, where the value is expressed as a ratio of

14

Figure 3: Ratio of Top 10 Percent Income Share to Population Share, 2000 and 2014

15

the group-specific dollar threshold divided by the White threshold. For example, in the year 2000, the dollar
amount associated with the 20th percentile of the White income distribution was $21,160 while the dollar
amount associated with the 20th percentile of the Asian distribution in 2000 was just $16,935. This is an
Asian-White ratio of approximately 0.8, which is plotted in Figures 5–9 for each year and reflected in the
line labeled “Asian.” To continue the example, at the low end of the income distribution—in this case the
20th percentile—the American Indian income level was only $11,917, which is just 56 percent of the White
value.
If a race group were at exact parity with Whites in all years, we would see a horizontal line for that
race group at the value of 1. As shown here, all of the groups with the exception of Asians had substantially
lower dollar values at their 20th percentile cuto↵ than the corresponding dollar value at the 20th percentile
for Whites.13 In this figure, Asians experienced gains relative to Whites over the time period. The remaining
race and ethnic groups tended to gain somewhat over the period compared to Whites at their respective 20th
percentiles; there is some evidence for a decline in the post-Great Recession period for Hispanics, Blacks,
and the Other category.
The next figure repeats the analysis at the 40th percentile. The dollar amount associated with the
40th percentile of the Asian income distribution was fairly close to that of the White group at their 40th
percentile. The other race and ethnic groups clustered at levels well below parity with Whites for all observed
years in our data. Once again, there was a slight downturn for these same groups relative to Whites after
the Great Recession.
The third, fourth, and fifth figures provide a similar analysis at the 60th, 80th, and 95th income
percentiles, respectively. There continues to be a divergence in the dollar amounts associated with these
income percentiles for both Asians and Whites and the rest of the race and ethnic groups in the data.
Moreover, Asians began surpassing Whites in the 60th percentile after 2007, and they were above parity
with Whites in all years in the 80th and 95th percentiles. All other race and ethnic groups continued to be
clustered at lower levels below parity with Whites for all observed years in our data.
A striking result across most of the percentiles is that Blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics had
income that is, at best, about two-thirds that of Whites and, at worst, about half the income of Whites.
13 The slight bump that occurs for most groups in 2007 is due to the tax rebates that required individuals to file a tax return
in order to receive the rebate. Therefore, the year 2007 witnessed a dramatic increase in 1040 tax filers with low or zero incomes
(those who would otherwise have not been required to file federal income taxes). The increase in the number of extremely
low-income filers necessarily drove down the threshold for the 20th percentile. The results indicate that the filing of tax returns
di↵ered by group since the results are all relative to non-Hispanic White. Note that the bump disappears in the subsequent
figures after the 40th percentile as the upper income points are less sensitive to changes associated at the bottom of the income
distribution.

The results appear to be constant whether we are examining the low, middle, or high ends of the income
distribution. This result suggests that these di↵erences are related to more than just class-based explanations

Measures of Within-Group Inequality Over Time

Figure 10 tracks the annual Gini coefficient for each race and ethnic group. There are three main findings
to be taken from this figure. The first is that within-group inequality varies by race and ethnicity. The
most unequal groups (the highest Gini coefficients) are Whites, Asians, and the Other group. The Hispanic,
Black, American Indian, and Pacific Islander groups tended to have lower levels of within-group inequality
for all years compared with the other three groups. These groups, on average, tended to be the poorest
groups as well.
The second finding is that levels of within-group inequality increased from 2000 to 2014 for all race
and ethnic groups. However, Black, American Indian, Other, and Hispanic within-group inequality increased
more over the time period relative to Asian, White, and Pacific Islander within-group inequality. Our third
finding is that within-group income inequality decreased for most groups during the recessionary periods.
Whites and Asians experienced the largest decrease in within-group inequality during the recessionary periods
relative to other groups. We note that the sharp increase in income inequality in 2007 is primarily due to the
increase in tax filers for the tax rebates for that year; everyone eligible for the rebate had to file to receive,
even if they were not legally required to file because their income was below the filing threshold. Therefore,
a large number of individuals with very low or zero income filed taxes, which increased the lower bound of

3.4

Within-Group Inequality by Income Deciles

The next set of figures display di↵erent parts of the within-group income distribution for each race and
ethnic group. We create three figures that plot the log of the ratio for two di↵erent income percentiles by
21

race. The first two figures focus on the top and bottom halves of the income distributions. For the log ratio
of the 90th percentile to the 50th percentile, we are able to examine whether inequality in the top half of the
income distribution increased or decreased. In a similar fashion, the log ratio of the 50th percentile to the
10th percentile identifies whether there were changes in income inequality at the bottom half of the income
distribution. Finally, we plot the logged ratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile for each race
or ethnic group by year. This measure indicates whether the top end of the income distribution is moving
further away from the bottom end of the income distribution over time. We standardize all of the results by
the initial ratio level in 2000 in order to show the progression of the change of the within-group inequality
relative to the starting conditions in 2000.
Figure 11 examines the corresponding results for the upper part of the income distribution. In this
figure, we plot the log of the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile for each race and ethnic group by year.
The results indicate that there was an increase in income inequality for all groups over the 15-year time
span. All groups experienced a 10 to 13 percent increase in the 90–50 ratio during this period except for
Hispanics (7 percent). These results indicate that the rich are becoming richer within each race and ethnic
group.
Figure 12 plots the log ratio of the 50th and 10th percentiles for all years in our data. On average
most race and ethnic groups in the bottom half of the income distributions experienced little change in the
level of income inequality over the period studied. In particular, Blacks appear to have realized a slight
reduction in the log ratio of the 50th to 10th income since 2000. Examining the actual income thresholds for
these percentiles indicates that this is driven primarily by a rise in the 10th percentile level of income relative
to the 50th percentile. For Whites (and the Other race to some extent), the results indicate an increase
in the level of income inequality for the bottom half of the income distribution over the 15 years studied;
the results indicate that income inequality increased by almost 15 percent between 2000 and 2014 for this
group. Examining the actual income thresholds for the 10th and 50th percentiles indicates that the increase
in inequality was driven by a distinct drop in the income threshold for the 10th percentile. In this case,
the poor are getting poorer over this time period. Note that all of these results are within-group (relative)
changes and there are large, persistent absolute di↵erences on average across all of the groups studied in
terms income.
In Figure 13, we provide the logged ratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile for each race
and ethnic group, which essentially combines the results found in the two previous figures. There is an
upward trend in this ratio for all groups over the 15-year period. Inequality within groups appears to have

22

increased at a relatively constant rate for all groups with the exception of Whites. There was approximately
a 3 percent to 7 percent increase in within-group income inequality over this period for all groups other than
Whites. In the case of Whites, income inequality increased by almost 12 percent over the 15 years studied.
The observed increase is driven by the upward movement of the 90th percentile and the downward movement
of the 10th percentile for Whites over this period. Both ends of the income distribution are moving away
from each other for this group in particular.

4

Income Immobility

Inequality is not the only component that matters in measures of economic equity: levels of income mobility
across race and ethnic groups matters as well. High levels of income immobility, coupled with the increase
in income inequality, would tend to further entrench class di↵erences across races. Previous research has
shown that, in general, mobility has been stable for much of the previous 25 years (Kopczuk et al., 2010).
Mitnik et al. (2016) finds that the increase in income inequality seen in previous decades is associated with
a decline in mobility. In this section, we present measures of income mobility (or rather immobility) by race
and ethnic origin. Specifically, we analyze three di↵erent measures of income mobility: the first measures
within-group mobility, and the other two capture mobility for all race and ethnic groups across the full
income distribution.

4.1

The Shorrocks Index

A frequently used relative measure of mobility is the Shorrocks Index. This measure allows for a comparison
between short- and long-run income inequality. In a society where there is no mobility, long-run income
inequality will simply equal short-run inequality. However, with some amount of mobility in society, shortrun income inequality will be equal to long-run societal inequality by a factor equal to the mobility measure.
Similar to Kopczuk et al. (2010), we use the following equation to describe this relationship:

Long-term income inequality = Short-term income inequality ⇤ (1

Mobility)

(1)

We use the Gini coefficient calculated over several years of income data as our long-term measure of
income inequality. In our analysis, we select three years given our 15 years of data available. We define
short-term income inequality as the average of three di↵erent Gini coefficients calculated for each year

23

independently. The following equation defines that relationship:14

G(Z) 

PK

G(Zt )
⇥ (1
K

t=1

Mobility)

(2)

The Shorrocks Index is the term in parentheses on the right had side of the equal sign. The variable
Z is the three-year aggregate of income while K = the number of time periods, equal to three in our
example. The equation tells us that for a given level of short-run inequality, higher levels of mobility (where
Mobility 2 {0, 1}) translate into a lower upper bound for long-run income inequality. In other words, more
income mobility means that we should expect less income inequality in the long run if short-run inequality
remains relatively stable. Income mobility is generally seen as an important characteristic in measuring and
predicting income inequality.
We calculate the Shorrocks Index for each group separately and plot the results in Figure 14. The
index is equal to 1

Mobility; therefore, a value close to 1 indicates very low levels of mobility. The

index is a relative ranking measure of mobility—in other words, it reflects group-specific mobility, where
an individual’s income is compared only to income from individuals in the same race or ethnic group. Our
findings suggest that, on average, there are very low levels of mobility for all race and ethnic groups in our
data. The groups with the lowest levels of within-group mobility tend to be White, Asians, and Other.
Hispanics, Blacks, American Indians, and Pacific Islanders display relatively higher levels of within-group
income mobility at all years in our data. The Black and American Indian groups in particular experienced
higher levels of mobility in the years 2006–2008 than did other groups in our data (potentially due to the
e↵ect of the contemporaneous tax rebates), but they quickly return to the same levels as Pacific Islanders
by 2009.

4.2

Two-Year Rank Correlations

While the Shorrocks Index measures within-group mobility, we also present an absolute mobility measure
using the overall income distribution. We sort individuals, regardless of group membership, by their income
in year t and then assign each person a rank in the income distribution according to their location. We then
correlate that rank number for an individual with their rank for t + 1. If a person does not move very much
in the income distribution between the first and second year, then the associated correlation coefficient will
approach 1. Alternatively, if the person is mobile in the income distribution (moving either up or down),
14 The inequality symbol is due to the convexity of the Gini function and the fact that the function is also homogeneous of
degree 0.

then this correlation will approach zero. Finally, we take the average correlation over all individuals by race
or ethnic group. We limit the sample to individuals who appear in the tax data for two consecutive years.
In Figure 15 we provide the correlation coefficients by race and ethnic group by year. There are two
points worth noting in this figure. First, there are high levels of immobility in income by race and ethnic
group. In fact, it appears that all groups increased in their immobility from 2008 onward. Second, for some
groups, immobility varied more when comparing individuals to the entire income distribution than it did
when limiting the comparison to individuals from the same group. For example, Blacks were relatively more
mobile within their own income distribution when compared with other groups, but until approximately
2010, they experienced the highest rank correlation of any group. Asians experienced the sharpest increase
in income immobility over our time period, with Whites, those in the Other group, and Pacific Islanders
following closely behind.

4.3

Transition Matrices

An additional method to examine income mobility is the use of transition matrices for individuals at two
points in time (Bloome, 2014). We restrict our sample to individuals who are present in the first year of our
data and at the final year of our data (years 2000 and 2014).15 We identify the income quintiles (a total of
five bins) in 2000 for all individuals in our selected sample. Then we identify the same person’s location in
the income quintile in 2014. We calculate the probability, by group, that a person will be in a given quintile
at the end of the period based on the starting quintile. These probabilities are shown in transition matrices
in Figures 16 Panels A-G. The first figure presents the results for Whites. The income quintiles for 2000 are
given across the five rows and the income quintiles for 2014 are given across the columns. We arrange the
quintiles in order from lowest to highest along a 1–5 ordering. The darkness of the shaded squares indicates
a higher probability of being in a particular cell. The results are calculated based on row probabilities. For
example, the first cell in Figure 16 Panel A is 44.15, which means that about 44 percent of Whites who
started out in the first (lowest) income quintile in 2000 remained in the lowest income quintile in 2014.
Along the diagonal, we observe that there is a high probability of remaining in the same income quintile over
time. Individuals who start out in the highest income quintile are the most likely to remain there: we find
that 55 percent of Whites remained in that same position in the income distribution. These results suggest
strong immobility for upper-income Whites. There is a very small likelihood of low-income Whites moving
15 We restrict our analysis in Appendix Figures A1 through A7 to the years 2005-2014 and add individuals who have W2
earnings but do not file a 1040 form. This robustness check allows us to evaluate whether there is a significant di↵erence when
these individuals are included in the analysis. There are no strong qualitative (or quantitative) di↵erences across the transition
matrices with and without the additional individuals who were identified from using the W2 forms.

26

up to the highest income quintiles by 2014 (less than 5 percent). We also observe evidence of people sliding
back—moving to lower quintiles from 2000 to 2014.
All race groups follow this general pattern, with high probabilities of immobility across quintiles,
very high immobility in the lowest and highest income quintiles, and people sliding back to lower quintiles.
However, the levels vary across race and ethnic groups. Asians exhibit the highest level of immobility at
the highest quintile, where 61.5 percent were in the fifth quintile in both 2000 and 2014. Asians experience
the greatest mobility in quintiles two through four relative to other groups. For these quintiles, while many
Asians are sliding backwards, a greater proportion of Asians moved up in comparison with other groups.
Blacks have the highest level of immobility in the bottom quintile compared to all other groups:
strikingly, 60 percent of Blacks who started in the lowest income quintile in 2000 remained in the lowest
quintile in 2014. About 33 percent of Blacks who started in the second quintile in 2000 remained in that
quintile in 2014; only Hispanics have a higher level of immobility in the second quintile at 35 percent.
Conversely, Blacks had the lowest percentage of people relative to other race and ethnic groups that remained
in the highest quintile from 2000 to 2014: 45 percent. Blacks and Hispanics were also more likely to slide
back to lower quintiles compared to Whites and Asians. Twenty-nine percent of Blacks and Hispanics who
started out in the second quintile in 2000 slid to the first quintile in 2014. Moreover, 41 percent of Blacks
who started out in the third quintile in 2000 fell to the first or second quintiles by 2014. In other words, 69
percent of Blacks who started in the third quintile in 2000 were either immobile (28 percent) or downwardly
mobile (41 percent).
Generally, all other race groups fall in between Whites and Asians on one hand, and Blacks on the
other. Immobility and downward mobility patterns for Hispanics and American Indians more closely resemble
those of Blacks and the Other group, while the pattern for Pacific Islanders more closely resembles those
of Whites and Asians. To our knowledge, the stark di↵erences in mobility patterns seen when comparing
groups to one another is a new finding in the literature.

Conclusion

Our analysis examines incomes for the universe of tax filers for the U.S. over the period 2000 to 2014 by race
and ethnic group. To our knowledge, we are the first to be able to provide in-depth analysis of relatively
smaller race and ethnic groups, overcoming the limitations of survey data or administrative records used
separately. Through the use of restricted IRS tax data and U.S. Census race and ethnicity data, we have

created a novel data set that allows for an examination of annual incomes, income inequality, income shares,
and income mobility by race and Hispanic origin.
We find, as expected, that there are large di↵erences in income shares across race and ethnic groups
over this time period. What is more startling is the persistence of disadvantage of certain minority groups
relative to Whites at every point in the income distribution. Whites and Asians tend to accrue higher income
shares at all points in time, especially towards the end of our time period. Asians occupy a unique position
and have more than their proportionate population share of income both at the top and the bottom of the
income distribution. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians tend to be clustered at the low end of the
income distribution across all years, while Pacific Islanders and our Other group are slightly higher than
these groups but still never at parity with Whites and Asians.
Within-group inequality analysis shows that for all races, individuals at the 90th percentile gained
income at a pace that far surpassed that of the 50th percentile. While there were some di↵erences across
race and ethnic groups in intensity, this pattern held for each group. Additionally, we find that that for
most groups the log 50th/10th ratio remained mostly constant except for Whites. This suggests that the
upper half of the income distribution for all race and ethnic groups is becoming less equal, and the bottom
half remains mostly unchanged. Notable di↵erences are for Whites which are experiencing an increase in
both the top and bottom half of the income distribution; the bottom change is being driven primarily by a
reduction of the threshold level of income for the 10th percentile. For Blacks we find that there is a reduction
in inequality for the bottom half of the distribution driven primarily by an increase in the threshold level of
income for the 10th percentile over time.
Using several di↵erent measures, we calculate income mobility across race and ethnic groups in the U.S.
Our findings indicate that there is a high level of immobility for all groups in general. We find di↵erences in
mobility for di↵erent groups: Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians have lower levels of overall mobility
compared with Asians. However, these same groups have the highest levels of mobility within their own
groups. This indicates that there is movement within each of the relatively poorer groups in our data, but
such movement is confined to the lower end of the overall income distribution.
By our measures, the race and ethnic groups with generally high levels of income also tend to have
the highest measures of inequality and within-group immobility. The evidence that high-income groups are
less mobile and more unequal will be useful in thinking about how to alleviate persistent poverty in certain
race and ethnic groups. Mobility by itself is not the solution when it results in movement only within the
lowest parts of the respective income distribution. Additionally, income inequality can mask changes in

29

di↵erent parts of the income distribution. Blacks have witnessed a slight increase in income inequality as
measured by a standard Gini coefficient; however, there are stark di↵erences at di↵erent points within the
income distribution. Income inequality for this group has increased in the log 90th/50th income ratio while
there has been a reduction in the log 50th/10th income ratio. The overall Gini increases obscure important
changes occurring within the upper and lower part of each group-specific income distribution.
Our results tell the following story about income inequality and mobility by race and ethnic groups.
First, Whites and Asians simply have more income than other groups at every point in the income distribution. Second, Whites, Asians, and those in the Other group experience both higher income inequality and
income immobility when looking at within-group measures. Third, while within-group measures for lowerincome groups, such as Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Pacific Islanderi ndicate lower within-group
inequality, this is more due to individuals being clustered at the low end of the overall income distribution.
Finally, when looking at this overall distribution, low-income groups start the period with high levels of
immobility; higher-income groups, however, eventually catch up in this measure. This picture that emerges
is of a rigid distribution of income, with Whites, Asians, and, to a lesser extent, those in the Other group
protected at the top and all other groups confined to the bottom. These results suggest that race and
ethnicity continue to play a central role in explaining the persistence of inequality and income immobility.

Robustness Checks using Transition Matrices

The preceding analysis employed AGI reported on the Form 1040 for the income measure, thus limiting the
analysis to tax filers. This choice of sample may bias our reported estimates due to the loss of information
on non-filers and non-earners who are working age, since race and ethnic origin are correlated with tax filing.
This bias may be especially problematic in the case of the transition matrices, where upward or downward
mobility may be impacted by individuals who have zero earnings in the first period and positive earnings
in the later period, and vice versa. If these types of transitions vary by group, transition matrices without
information on these types of transitions may lead to erroneous comparisons. We address this concern using
two further analyses: first, we add observations from W-2 data to the race and ethnicity file when these W-2
recipients do not file a 1040; and second, we look at the universe of working age men in the 2000 and 2010

decennial censuses, linking them to their 1040 information as before and setting any observation without a
1040 to zero AGI.
In the case of the W-2 data, we do not know what dependents—if any—a person might claim, nor do
we know marital status. For the earners in the W-2, we assign a 1 as the equivalency scale and the sum
of W-2 wage and salary earnings as income. W-2 data are available only from 2005 forward. For the sake
of comparison, we show transition matrices between 2005 and 2014 using both our main data and the data
including the W-2 in this appendix.
Because of the shorter time frame, individuals are more “fixed” in position in the distribution compared
with the 15-year span of data in the main results. However, patterns by group remain similar to those seen
in the main data, with only slight changes in values in comparable cells. Not surprisingly, the inclusion
of W2 data has the most impact for each group at the low end of the distribution, appearing to move the

proportion of observations who were in the lowest quintile in each year into higher quintiles (this is with the
exception of American Indian, where those in the second quintile at the start appear to also move down).
For the final set of matrices, we took decennial census data from 2000 and 2010 and selected all men
between the ages of 25 and 65 in each year. We then linked these men to 1040 data as before, but retained the
observations not found in the 1040 data and set AGI to zero. We also set AGI to zero for observations found
in the 1040 who had AGI less than zero (in the main analysis, these observations were dropped). Our choice
of men aligns this analysis more closely with traditional economic research on labor market participation
and wage inequality. The years chosen allow us to make statements based on two point-in-time populations
of working-age men (2000 and 2010). In other words, while 2014 is the final year in the main analysis, there
is no corresponding complete population from which to select the population of men—thus we use 2000.
Allowing men of working age to have zero earnings in either period may give a more complete picture
of transitions from one period to the next. Comparing these matrices to those reported in the main analysis
indicates that the stark di↵erences we find between Whites and lower-income minority groups may be
understated. Whites show a slightly greater probability of upward mobility, while Blacks show an even more
pronounced downward mobility and stagnation in the first quintile. The picture for Hispanics is slightly
better than for Blacks, but both this group and American Indians also show evidence of greater downward
mobility into lower quintiles. Pacific Islanders and those in the Other category show a greater dispersion
into both higher and lower quintiles, while Asians show slightly higher upward mobility.
The preceding results highlight the advisability of including observations with zero income, when possible, to income inequality studies. However, this opens up questions on who should be included as a potential
income earner and who should not, and from what data sources we can expect to gain insight into whom
should be included and whom excluded. We leave these questions for future research.
