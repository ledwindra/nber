    "abstract": "\n\nWe model optimal fund turnover in the presence of time-varying profit opportunities. Our model predicts a positive relation between an active fund\u2019s turnover and its subsequent benchmark-adjusted return. We find such a relation for equity mutual funds. This time-series relation between turnover and performance is stronger than the cross-sectional relation, as the model predicts. Also as predicted, the turnover-performance relation is stronger for funds trading less-liquid stocks, such as small-cap funds. Turnover has a common component that is positively correlated with proxies for stock mispricing, consistent with funds exploiting time-varying opportunities. Turnover\u2019s common component helps predict fund returns.\n\n",
