How globalization affect income-based attitudes towards globalization?  The paper addresses these issues in the framework of a small open economy which trades in goods and financial securities with the rest of the world. Income-based political cleavages analyzed are grounded on trade-related and macro-related fundamentals, familiar from a standard open-economy model. They are:  (i) The degree of trade border frictions, (ii) The degree of international finance frictions, (iii) The relative factor abundance that determines the capital intensity of the country\u2019s exports; and, (iv) The domestic savings and productivity of domestic investment, which determines whether the country is a financial capital exporter or importer.\n\n",
