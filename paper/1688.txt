August 1985

The Economics of
Reproduction-Related Health Care

ABS TRACT

This paper presents the first systematic estimates of the direct

money costs of reproduction-related health services. In 1982 Americans
spent approximately $17.7 billion for contraception, abortion, treatment

of infertility, obstetrical care, and infant care. This represented 5.5
percent of total health care spending and was equal to $327 per woman of

reproductive age (15—44). Obstetrical care accounted for almost half of
the reproduction-related expenditures and infant care accounted for more

than one—third. The paper discusses the demographic, technologic, economic,
and sociopolitical factors that determine these expenditures. It also
considers related public policy issues regarding legal status, sources of
funding, and allocation of resources.

THE ECONOMICS OF REPRODUCTION-RELATED HEALTH CARE

With increasing frequency and escalating rhetoric,
discussions of reproduction—related issues have been moving from

the sciencepage to the front page and even into the headlines.
The attempts to ban abortion, the debates about "high tech"
obstetrical methods, and the concern over the cost of neonatal
intensive care all call attention to this special sector of the
health care system. Despite the furor, however, there is little
solid information available about reproduction—related health
services, especially from an economic perspective. What fraction
of total health care spending is accounted for by this sector?
What are the primary determinants of spending for contraception,
infertility treatment, abortion, obstetrical, and infant care?
What are the most important public policy issues, and how can

economic analysis contribute to their resolution?
We do not suppose that individuals whose views about
contraception, abortion, surrogate mothers, and the like are
inalterably determined by religious convictions will find
economic considerations to be relevant. But those who believe
that the human predicament involves sacrificing some ultimate
values to others may find our approach helpful. We emphasize the
scarcity of resources relative to wants, the need to achieve a
balance between incremental benefits and incremental costs, and
the responsiveness of human behavior to changes in incentives and

1

constraints. We do not believe that economics can "solve" the
problems associated with reproduction, but we suggest that the

economic perspective can contribute to a fuller understanding of
trends and issues.
In 1982 there were 5L million American women of childbearing
age (15J4LI), of whom about 29 million used some form of

contraception, including sterilization. Approximately ten percent
had the opposite problem——difficulty in conceiving——and about one
million of them received medical advice or treatment for
infertility. In that same year, approximately six million women
learned that they were pregnant. One—fourth of the pregnancies
ended with an induced abortion and another 15 percent of these
confirmed conceptions ended in miscarriage or stillbirth. Thus,

3,681,000 babies were delivered, of whom 2,OOO died within the
first year. Nearly all of the babies received some medical care
and a small percentage received a great deal.
The paper begins with an estimate of total expenditures for
reproduction—related services in the United States. The second
section examines the factors which influence the supply of and
demand for these services, and the final section discusses
important policy issues concerning their legal status, funding,
and resource allocation.

Estimates of Expenditures

This section presents estimates of total direct money
expenditures for contraception, treatment of infertility,
abortion, obstetrical care, and health care during the first year
of life. No single source contains all the Information of
Interest; therefore data on costs and utilization are drawn from
a variety of sources ranging from national surveys to small
clinical studies. All prices and quantities are for 1982 unless
otherwise stated. Some estimates are based on data from other
years, extrapolated to 1982 with the aid of related price and
quantity series.

Contraception

Approximately 5L percent of American women ages 15—u use
some form of contraception. The cost in 1982 was about $2.1
billion, or $81 per contracepting woman and $L11 per woman of

childbearing age. Of those who are not contracepting, most are
sexually inactive, noncontraceptively sterile, pregnant, postpartum,
or seeking pregnancy. About L million women ages 15_1Lt, however, are

sexually active and not trying to conceive, but using no method of birth
control (see Table 1). Among these women who are at greatest risk of
unintended pregnancy, nearly two—thirds are not married.
The majority of contraceptors use one of the most effective
forms of birth control: male or female sterilization (33 percent),

birth control pills (28 percent), or IUDs (7 percent).
Expenditures for these methods amount to over $1.9 billion,

80 percent of the total. Another 23 percent of contraceptors use

barrier methods: diaphragm, condom, or foam. Nine percent employ
the least effective methods, mainly rhythm and withdrawal.
Contraceptive sterilization has increased sharply in popularity
during the last decade, replacing the pill as the most common
method of birth control. Over half of contraceptors ages 3OLt1L

rely on sterilization, but among younger women the pill is still
preferred [National Center for Health Statistics, 198gb].
Expenditures for the different contraceptive methods vary in
the size and timing of outlays. The one—time payment for surgical
sterilization averages $1,180 for tubal ligation and $2'Il for

vasectomy. Physician visits and the purchase of contraceptive
devices contribute to high first—year expenditures for
prescription methods——an average of $15L for pill, IUD, and
diaphragm. In subsequent years, the IUD is costless, while
expenditures for pill and diaphragm are substantially reduced,
depending mainly on the cost of supplies [Torres and Forrest,
1983]. Whereas the costs of sterilization, pill, and IUD are
fixed for all women who use these methods, the expense associated
with barrier methods depends on the frequency of intercourse.
Frequency, in turn, may be related to the cost of using the
method.

Because of the unevenness in timing of expenditures,
estimates of the annual cost of contraception vary depending on
the technique of estimation. One technique is to count outlays in
the year that they are incurred. Estimated in this manner, annual
costs reflect actual cash flow. Consequently, the annual cost of
using a method can fluctuate from year to year, and, during a

5

single year, can vary greatly among women using the same method.
Alternatively, outlays for contraception can be viewed as
payments on a long—term investment in fertility control. Although the
actual payments are uneven, the total cost can be regarded as spread
smoothly over the entire period of protection against unintended
pregnancy. Because one—time contraceptive expenses are paid at

the beginning of the investment period rather than in annual
installments, an implicit interest charge must be added to the

total.1' The yearly cost becomes the Imputed annual payment for
interest and amortization on one—time expenses, plus the costs
that are incurred year after year. When estimated in this way,
all women using the same contraceptive method will have roughly
the same yearly cost.
In Table 2, contraceptive expenditures are calculated using
the interest and amortization technique. Conceptually it makes
more sense to spread the costs of contraception evenly over the
period of protection because the benefits of fertility control
accrue throughout this period. In 1979—1980 women obtaining tubal
sterilizations were, on average, 30 years old [Centers for
Disease Control, 1983b]. Thus, the cost of sterilization is
amortized over the approximately 15 remaining years of
reproductive life. One—time costs of the pill, IUD, and diaphragm
are spread over a three—year period. This assumes that each year
one—third of these contraceptors are first—time users or are
incurring equivalent costs for checkups, replacement devices,
etc.21 A real interest rate of

percent per annum is applied to

unamortized balances of one—time costs. Recurring costs are then
added to arrive at a total annual cost.

Using this technique of calculation, the pill is the most

expensive form of birth control, costing $130 per year. Female
sterilization costs $106 per year, while condom and male
sterilization are the lowest cost alternatives at $303" and $22
respectively (see Table 2). Applying these estimates to the
distribution of women by method yields a total expenditure for
contraception of $2.LI billion in 1982.

Infertility Services

At the same time that millions of women spend almost two and
one—half billion dollars to prevent births through contraception,
many other millions of women find it difficult or impossible to
conceive, and some of them seek medical advice and treatment. The

National Survey of Family Growth (1982) reports that LL million

women (8.2 percent of women 15_1UU have impaired fecundity and LL2
million are surgically sterile for noncontraceptjve reasons. More than
half of these 8.6 million women say they would like to become
pregnant. In addition, about one—fourth of women who have been
sterilized for contraceptive reasons (or whose partners are
contraceptivej.y sterile) indicate a desire for children [National
Center for Health Statistics, 1985b; Mosher, 198'4). Thus the potential

demand for infertility treatments, surrogate mothers, and related
services is probably very large. Among ever married women 15—14k in

1982, 6.3 million had sought medical attention for infertility at some
time in the past and approximately one million reported at least one
infertility visit during the previous twelve months [National Center
for Health Statistics, 198Za].

8

The amount spent by those seeking medical assistance for
infertility varies enormously from a few dollars for a single

physician visit to thousands of dollars for repeated attempts at
in vitro fertilization. There are no published estimates of
average or total expenditures for infertility services; in our
judgment they were still quite small in 1982, but probably
growing rapidly.

About half of infertility is partly or entirely due to a
problem of the male. A low sperm count or poor sperm motility,
the most common causes of male infertility, are easily diagnosed
through semen analysis. Some of these men can be helped by
surgery or other therapy; some couples eventually conceive
without treatment. An estimated 10,000 couples per year turn to
artificial insemination by donor. Usually two or three
inseminations are performed each cycle at a cost of approximately
$75 per insemination [Merining, 1982). About 80 percent of the

women receiving artificial insemination conceive within three to
six months [Feldschuh and Feldschuh, 1982].

Diagnostic workups to detect female infertility are usually
more extensive than for males. The two most common causes of
female infertility are failure to ovulate due to hormone
deficiency and blockage of the fallopian tubes. Failure to
ovulate can be detected by charting body temperature and blood
hormone levels or by biopsy of the uterine lining. Tubal
blockages can be viewed indirectly with X—rays or directly by
inserting a fiberoptic scope through an incision in the abdomen.

With new drugs and improved surgical techniques 50—60 percent of
infertility can be successfully treated; these treatments,
9

however, are often expensive. Drugs such as Clomid and Pergonal
can Induce egg production in women who don't ovulate naturally,
but one cycle of Pergonal can cost between $250 and $750 [Glass
and Ericsson, 1982). For women with blocked tubes, tubal surgery
provides the best chance for successful pregnancy.
The birth of the world's first "test tube" baby in 1978 gave
new hope to infertile women with severely damaged or missing
fallopian tubes, but widespread use of this experimental
technique is still far in the future. In the United States in
1982 there were probably fewer than 100 births resulting from in
vitro fertilization. These births were achieved at considerable
expense. Each attempt at fertilization costs about $3,000 for
medical expenses alone and only 15 percent of couples using this
technique succeed in having a live birth.
Data on utilization and expenditures for infertility
services are almost entirely nonexistent. Presumably some couples
spend little or nothing for infertility problems; a few spend an
extraordinary amount. As a rough estimate we assume an average
expenditure of $200 per couple seeking help, yielding a total of

$200 million for 1982.'

Abortion

According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, nearly 3
percent of all women between the ages of 15 and L14 had an

abortion in 1982. We estimate the money cost of these 1.5 million
abortions at $18k million. This is approximately $307 per
abortion, or about $9 per woman of childbearing age (see Table 3).

The Centers for Disease Control's estimate of the number of
abortions is about 20 percent lower. Their figure, however, is

based on summary reports from individual states and is probably
incomplete [Centers for Disease Control, 1983a].
Approximately 82 percent of abortions are performed In
clinics and doctorst offices; the remaining 18 percent in
hospitals. About 90 percent are performed In the first trimester
and 10 percent in the second trimester [Henshaw e.t

al.,

1984].

Over one—third of second trimester procedures take place in

hospitals, while only 16 percent of earlier abortions are
hospital procedures [Henshaw, 1985].
The estimates of the cost per abortion by site and trimester
are based on samples. A 1981 survey of 240 clinics reported
charges of $190 and $358 for first— and second—trimester

abortions, respectively IHenshaw, 1982]. We inflated these
charges slightly to bring them to 1982 levels because the price
of an abortion has been rising slowly in recent years [Henshaw e..t.

al.,

1984]. Charges for in—hospital abortions are based on very

small samples and are probably less reliable. One anomaly is that
the reported cost of a second—trimester abortion is less than
that of a first—trimester abortion in hospital. Perhaps hospitals
performing many abortions have relatively low charges and are more
likely to perform second—trimester procedures.
Estimates of' government expenditures for abortion lend

support to our overall figure. During fiscal year 1982 state and
federal agencies paid $68 million for 210,000 abortions, that is,
an average of $322 per publicly funded abortion [Nestor and Gold,

12

19814]. This is similar to our estimate of an average cost of $307

for all abortions.

Obstetrical Care

A large portion of reproduction—related expenditures are
accounted for by hospital charges and professional fees for
obstetrical care, including prenatal, delivery, and postnatal
services. We estimate total charges for these services at 8.2
billion dollars, approximately $2,230 per live birth. Hospital
charges account for nearly 60 percent of the total. Another 35
percent represent fees charged by obstetricians and anesthetists,
while laboratory tests, X—rays, and ultrasound cost an additional
$600 million (see Table 14).

Of the 3.7 million babies born in 1982, 99 percent were
delivered by physicians in hospitals or other medical facilities.
These admissions accounted for 10.5 percent of all hospital
admissions in that year, but because maternity stays are
relatively short——an average of 3.14

days

compared to 7.1 days for

all admissions——only 14.6 percent of total hospital days are for

women having babies [National Center for Health Statistics,
1985a]. The average hospital charge for a normal birth with labor
and delivery rooms was $1,130 (birthing rooms were $30 less).
Caesarean births——17.6 percent of all births in 1982——cost
$1,930, 70 percent more than a normal birth [Health Insurance
Association of America, 1982]. At an average cost of $1,270 per
birth, total obstetrical hospital charges were $14.7 billion. A

rough estimate of obstetrical hospital costs based on average
hospit.al costs supports this figure. The average expense per

patient day was $380 for nonfederal short—stay hospitals in 1982
[American Hospital Association, 19811]. If maternity hospital

admissions are of average expense, then the 3.7 million
admissions with an average length of 3.14 days cost $11.8 billion.

According to the Health Insurance Association of America, the

average physician fee for complete obstetrical care was $600 for
a normal delivery and $785 for a Caesarean delivery [Health
Insurance Association of America, 1982]. We use these estimates
although they are somewhat' lower than those found in a survey of

physicians by Medical Economics. They reported a median charge
for normal obstetrical care of $700 for obstetricians, $500 for
family practitioners, and $1150 for general practitioners

[Kirchner, 1982]. If 80 percent of babies are delivered by

obstetricians [National Center for Health Statistics, 1984c] and
the remaining births are spread equally between family and
general practitioners, the average charge is $655.
The average anesthetist's fee for a normal delivery was $150
[Health Insurance Association of America, 1982] and approximately
$250 for a Caesarean delivery. If all Caesarean deliveries and
half of normal deliveries require the services of an anesthetist,
the total bill for their services is $1100 million.

In recent years the use of high technology diagnostic
techniques in obstetrical care has grown rapidly. Of wOmen having
live births in 1980, 29 percent of those ages 35 and over and 14

percent of younger mothers received amniocentesis. Thirty percent
of all mothers received at least one ultrasound examination and

13 percent received at least one medical X—ray [Kleinman

15

1983; Hamilton

al., 198'I]. These procedures and other tests

not covered by the obstetrician's basic fee accounted for 17
percent of all nonhospital costs In a 1981 study of maternity
costs at the Palo Alto Medical Clinic [Scitovsky, 198I]. They add
another $600 million to the cost of having a baby.
In addition to the cost of live births, there were
undoubtedly charges incurred for miscarriages and stillbirths. We
estimate that stillbirths occurring after 28 weeks of pregnancy
incurred charges similar to those for live births. The proportion

of these stillbirths delivered by Caesarean section is as high as
among live births and electronic fetal monitoring is used almost

as frequently [Placek

al., 198L]. For those stillbirths

occurring between 20 and 28 weeks, we estimate the average charge
at three—quarters of the cost of a live birth, and for
miscarriages prior to 20 weeks we estimate a physician's fee
equal to one—third of the fee for a normal delivery.

Pediatric Care

Babies in their first year of life used medical care costing
approximately $6.5 billion in 1982. Sixty percent of the total

was spent on newborn care. Another 30 percent was paid for
medical care for infants requiring subsequent hospitalization
during the first year. Only 10 percent was spent on well baby
care, preventive care, and medical care for problems not
requiring hospitalization (see Table 5).

The majority of infants are normal and healthy, leaving the
hospital after a routine nursery stay. Pediatric care for a

normal newborn is $6 and the average hospital charge is $100 per
16

day, or $3140 total [Health Insurance Association of America,

1982]. Approximately 5 percent of the newborns, however, require
intensive neonatal care. Many are normal weight infants born with

congenital defects; a substantial portion are low birth weight
babies——that is, born weighing 2,500 grams or less. Nearly 7

percent of all babies are low weight at birth. These births
account for over half of all infant deaths and three—fourths of

all neonatal deaths (deaths within the first 28 days).
There are no national data on the utilization of neonatal
intensive care. Expenditures must be estimated from clinical
studies, often based on atypical populations and small samples.
Total physician and hospital costs for the first year of life
averaged $8,000 per infant in one study of 1,185 infants weighing
at least 500 grams at birth. The infants were treated in the
intensive care nursery at the University of California, San
Francisco Moffitt Hospital during a 30—month period in 1976—78.
Average total cost was $19,000 for babies weighing 501—1,000

grams at birth. For infants weighing at least 2,500 grams, the
average total cost was $5,600 [Phibbs, Williams, and Phibbs,
1981]. Another study of 75 babies weighing less than 1,000 grams
reported average hospital costs (1976 $) of $114,000 for the 145

infants who died and $110,000 for the 30 survivors [Pomerance et

al., 1978].
Peter Budetti

J,,. [1981] conducted a study of the costs

and effectiveness of neonatal intensive care for the
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. The researchers
estimated that average expenditures per patient in 1978 were

18

about $8,000. Adjusting their estimate by the CPI for medical
care, the average cost per admission was $12,000 in 1982. By this

estimate, the total cost of neonatal care for the approximately
185,000 infants admitted to intensive care nurseries was $2.2
billion.

In addition to lengthy hospital stays at birth, a substantial
portion of low weight infants are rehospitalized during the first

year of life. McCormick

j. [1980] estimate that 19.0 percent

of these infants have at least one additional hospital episode,
with an average of 12.5 hospital days during the year. Normal
weight infants have a rehospitalization rate of 8.11 percent with

an average stay of 7.8 days. These figures imply that infants
used 2.9 million hospital days in 1982.
The National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics reports much higher
figures——1,702 hospital days per 1,000 infants in 1982, or a
total of 6.3 million days [National Center for Health Statistics,
198'4d]. Some possible reasons for the huge disparity are that

NHDS estimates may include neonates who are transferred to
another hospital or to an intensive care unit within the same

hospital. Since McCormick's study excluded all hospitalizations
before the infant went home for the first time, her estimate

would be lower. In addition, McCormick's estimates relied on
interviews with parents of infants alive at one year. Actual

utilization would be underestimated if the infants who died
required more hospital care or if parents forgot to report some
of the hospital days. This paper uses an average of the two
estimates.-—'L6 million hospital days. At $380 per day (the
19

average expense per day for all admissions), hospital costs are
estimated at $1.7 billion. Physician fees for these

hospitalizations add another $230 million, assuming an average
charge of $50 per day.

According to unpublished data from The Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation National Perinatal Regionalization Program, normal

weight infants have an average of 10 physician visits during the
first year [McCormick, 1985]. On the other hand, the National
Ambulatory Medical Survey (NAMS) reported only ZLI4 office visits

to pediatricians per infant per year in 1980—81. If 70 percent of
all physician office visits by babies under age 2 were to

pediatricians [National Center for Health StatIstics, 1983], the
NAMS estimate implies an average of 6.3 visits per infant per

year. We split the difference between the sources and estimate
eight visits per year. Physician charges are estimated as $25 for
an initial office visit and $20 for a follow—up visit [Kirchner,
1982; American Medical Association, 1981]. Thus physician care
during the first year amounted to $600 million. Immunizations and
other services not included in the physician's fees added another

$130 million, assuming average charges of $35 per infant.

Summary
The total medical costs of reproduction amounted to

approximately $17.7 billion in 1982, about 5.5 percent of the
total health care expenditures. Table 6 shows that reproduction—
related expenditures came to $76 per person, $327 per woman of

childbearing age and $,810 per live birth. The bulk of
20

expenditures was for obstetrical care and care of infants in the
first year of life. Hospital and physician charges for

obstetrical care cost $8.2 billion and accounted for '5 percent
of the total. Pediatric care for infants, especially those
needing intensive care or rehospitalization, amounted to $6.5
billion and made up 35 percent of the total. Infertility
treatment, contraception, and abortion cost an additional $3.1
billion.

The Determinants of Expenditures
Reproduction—related services account for about 5 percent of

the total health care bill. What determines this level of
spending? Why not 8 percent? Or 3 percent? As shown in Figure 1,
expenditures are identically equal to the quantity of services

multiplied by the price per unit of service. This Is an
accounting definition. In a behavioral sense, quantity and price
are determined by demand and supply. Thus, analysis of
expenditures must consider the factors determining the demand

for, and supply of, reproduction—related services.
The primary forces affecting supply and demand are
demographic, technologic, economic, and sociopolitical. Within

each of these categories some factors may independentJ affect
expenditures, e.g., a breakthrough in basic science that creates
new possibilities for medical diagnosis or treatment. Many
factors, however, are interdependent, e.g., the development of a
new technology increases the demand for health insurance to pay
for the new service, while the spread of insurance increases the
demand for new technologies. The distinction between independent
and interdependent factors is not always clear cut. For instance,
in the short run the number of women of childbearing age may be

regarded as Independent, but over a long time horizon this number
depends on technologic, economic, and sociopolitical factors.
The following discussion identifies a few of the most
Important factors and their interdependencies within the domain

of reproduction—related services. One other interdependency
deserves mention, but will not be discussed in detail. That is,

the interdependency between reproduction—related expenditures and
other health care spending. For example, neonatal Intensive care

may improve the health status of surviving infants, thereby
reducing their need for medical care in subsequent years.
Conversely, excellent medical care for female children and
teenagers may reduce the Incidence of high—risk pregnancies and
low weight births.

Demographic Factors
The most obvious factor affecting expenditure for
reproduction—related services is the number of women of

childbearing age. In 1982 this group represented 23.6 percent of
the total U.S. population, up sharply from 20.1 percent in 1960.
This rise reflects the post—World War II "baby boom," which
followed a period of low fertility rates during the Great
Depression and World War II. The Bureau of the Census projects
that women of childbearing age will be 23.3 percent of the
population in 1990, but will fall to 21.5 percent by the year
2000 [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 19814].
The distribution within the 15—'4'I age group also matters,

because reproduction—related expenditures tend to peak between 20
and 30 and are substantially lower at younger and older ages (see
Figure 2 and Table 7). In 1982 only 39 percent of women of child-

bearing age were in their twenties, but they accounted for two—
thirds of all births, 55 percent of abortions, and 145 percent of

current expenditures for contraception. Older women spend much
less per capita because they have few births, few abortions, and

many are already contraceptively or noncontraceptivelY sterile.
Other things equal, shifts in the distribution within the 15—P4
year age group increased expenditures by 13 percent between 1960
and 1980 as the baby boomers moved into their 20s. These shifts

will decrease expenditures by 15 percent between 1980 and 2000 as
the baby boom cohorts get older and the smaller cohorts of the
1990s enter the peak childbearing ages.
Given the number of women of childbearing age, their

fertility is the major determinant of expenditures because
obstetrical and infant care dominate the total. To be sure, the
fertility rate is not completely independent; it is affected by
technologic, economic, and sociopolitical factors. The general
fertility rate dropped by Z13 percent between 1960 and 1982, from

118.0 to 67.3 births per thousand women ages 15—1. If the 5Lt

million women in 1982 were having babies at the 1960 fertility
rate, 75 percent more babies would have been born, and
reproduction—related expenditures would have been over $28
billion. The offsets of lower expenditures for contraception and
abortion would have been small; even if desired family size rises
from two to four, a couple will have to oontracept most of the
time.

Given the fertility rate, cost is affected by the age and
marital status of the mothers. Unmarried women are twice as
likely as married women to deliver a low birth weight baby, and
teenagers are at higher risk regardless of marital status. Low
birth weight babies are more likely to be delivered by Caesarean
section [Placek et. .1., 1983], are more likely to need expensive

28

special care after birth, and are more likely to require
rehospitalization during the first year. Thus, obstetrical and
infant care expenditures per birth vary with the age of the

mother, as shown in Table 7. The cost for older women rises
because they are also at greater risk of having a low birth
weight baby and they have the highest Caesarean section rates.
The proportion of births delivered by older women is declining:
women 35 and over accounted for 11 percent of births in 1960 but
only 5 percent in 1982. The proportion delivered to unmarried
mothers (of all ages), however, increased sharply in the late
1960s and 1970s.

Technological Factors
Technologic advances have a strong effect on expenditures

because they change the set of feasible alternatives and/or
change the cost of producing existing services. In some
industries technologic advances result in lower total
expenditures, and this occasionally happens in health care as
well. For instance, the discovery of anti—infectious drugs and
vaccines resulted in lower total expenditures for treatment of
infectious diseases. Usually, however, new medical technology
adds to expenditures. For instance, advances in neonatal
intensive care allow physicians and nurses to treat and save
infants who would have died in the past. New fertility drugs and
improved surgical techniques allow many infertile couples to have
children of their own.
Increasingly in obstetrics, electronic devices and
ultrasound supplement the less expensive stethescope and clinical
29

examination when monitoring fetal status. In 1980 one—third of
expectant mothers received at least one ultrasound examination
during pregnancy, and one—half received electronic fetal

monitoring during labor [Placek

j, 19811]. Increased

monitoring has probably contributed to a rise in the proportion
of babies delivered by Caesarean section from 7 percent of' live

births in 1972 to 17 percent in 1980. The standard practice of
repeating Caesarean section delivery in all subsequent births has
also increased use of this procedure.
The pace and character of technologic change in medicine

depends in part on exogenous advances in science (e.g., the
discovery of DNA) and on the funding provided by NIH and other
sources. Innovation and diffusion of more applied technologies
are also heavily influenced by the willingness and ability of'

society to pay for medical care. Thus, during the 1960s and
1970s, open—ended, retrospective reimbursement by private and
public health insurers provided a strong stimulus to technologic
change. New methods of financing health care in the 1980s,
including Medicare's prospective payment system, health
maintenance organizations, and preferred provider organizations,
are likely to dampen the growth of' expensive new technologies and

shift the emphasis toward innovations that reduce costs.

Economic Factors

The demand for reproduction—related services, like the
demand for any good or service, depends on price, income, and the

30

prices of substitute and complementary commodities, as well as

numerous physiological, psychological, and social variables. The
basic law of demand states that, other things equal, the lower
the price the greater the quantity demanded. The validity of this
law with respect to medical care in general has been demonstrated
ENewhouse

nj., 1981; Leibowitz

nj..., 1985) and there can be

little doubt that it applies to reproduction—related services as

well. The growth of third—party payment has undoubtedly
contributed to increased expenditures. Even when the decisions

about utilization are made by the physician rather than the
patient, third—party payment, which lowers the price to the
consumer, results in greater demand if the physician acts in the
intereits of the individual patient.

Neonatal intensive care is an area where third—party payment
makes a big difference. The cost of care for some low birth
weight babies and some normal weight babies born with severe
problems is far beyond the reach of the average parent. Without
private insurance or public support, this care would not be
delivered and Infant mortality would be somewhat above Its
present level.

One aspect of reproduction that is still poorly covered by
third—party payment is the treatment of infertility. Given the
large number of Americans who might benefit from such services,

and given the high cost of some interventions such as in vitro
fertilization, expenditures in this area might increase greatly
from their present low level if such services were covered by
private or public insurance.
A change in the price of one service can affect not only the
31

demand for that service, but also the demand for related
services. For example, a drop in the price of effective
contraception could lower the demand for abortions by reducing
the number of unwanted pregnancies. Similarly, if prenatal care
can increase birthweight, a lower price for prenatal care might
reduce the demand for neonatal intensive care. These price
changes will not affect behavior unless the consumer can benefit
from a decision to use less expensive care. For example,

childbearing centers and midwives provide obstetrical care to low
risk women at only 50 to 60 percent of the cost of traditional

care. Some women may favor this alternative because of its
emphasis on low—intervention childbirth. With full insurance,

however, there is no financial incentive to choose the low cost
care.

The full price of a service includes not only its money
price but also the value of the time spent on the service. An
increase in the value of time (because of the growth of real

wages) affects the demand for reproduction—related services
directly and indirectly. All time—intensive activities such as

staying in the hospital after delivery or taking the infant to
the physician for a well—baby checkup become relatively more

expensive. An important indirect effect on demand occurs through
fertility, because, other things equal, an increase In the value
of women's time tends to lower the birth rate.

Other than price, the principal economic factor affecting
expenditures is the growth of real income per capita. As income
rises, demand for most goods and services rises, and again

32

reproduction—related services are no exception. All other things
equal, a wealthier society can better afford to treat an
infertile couple or try to keep a low birth weight baby alive.

Socio—politleal Factors

Sociopolitical considerations affect the utilization of
reproduction—related services in many ways and at many levels.
Expenditures are influenced by laws that prohibit, permit, or
encourage various behaviors. National policy toward abortion, for
instance, as established by federal legislation and Supreme Court

decisions, affects the willingness and ability of women to have
abortions. Abortion policy, in turn, affects other types of
expenditures such as obstetrical and infant care. If abortion

were illegal, the fertility rate and number of low birth weight
babies would increase. The proportion of babies needing neonatal

intensive care would also probably increase because so many of
the abortions are performed on teenagers and unmarried women.
Expenditures for reproduction—related services are

significantly influenced by prevailing norms regarding socially
acceptable behavior. For example, attitudes toward premarital and
extramarital sex clearly affect expenditures for contraception
and abortion. These attitudes may change as a result of

fundamental shifts in philosophy and religion, or in reaction to
advances in technology (e.g., female—controlled contraceptive

techniques) and changes in the economy (e.g., growing
opportunities for women in paid employment). Prenatal screening
for genetic disorders is an area with a large potential for
growth. How extensively these services are utilized will depend
33

on laws and attitudes concerning selective abortion and the care
of infants born with chromosomal abnormalities.
Public commitment to equality of health care will also
affect expenditures, but the direction of the effect can vary. In
the United States, the push for equality in the 1960s and 1970s
tended to increase total expenditures by making more care
available to the poor. By contrast, the British National Health
Service in England has attempted to equalize access to some kinds
of care by limiting available services to all.

3L

Public Policy Issues

Public policy issues concerning reproduction—related
services are as hotly debated as any in our society. This is not
surprising, given the subjects involved: sexual behavior, the
creation of life, the responsibilities of parents, and the rights
of helpless infants. We cannot hope to do full justice to the

moral, legal, and political dimensions of these issues, nor can
we discuss in detail the issues that arise in each of the five

areas of expenditures. Instead, we present a general discussion
with a few specific examples of public policy issues in three

broad categories: legal status, sources of funding, and
allocation of resources.

Legal Status

The most basic policy question that arises with respect to
several reproduction—related services is their legal status.

Should service X" be permitted or should it be banned? Currently
this debate focuses on abortion, but in the past similar battles
were waged over contraception, and in the future Infertility
services such as surrogate mothering may receive increased
scrutiny. The economic approach suggests that human welfare is

maximized when individuals are free to act in their own
interests, provided their actions do not harm others who are not
part of the decislonmaking process. Controversies arise over the
identification of the "others" and the degree of harm that they
experience.

35

Economies cannot do much to resolve these controversies, but
it can suggest how people would respond to a change in the
legality of an activity. A ban on abortion, for instance, would

have the following effects. First, there would be fewer
pregnancies because of the greater incentive to contracept or to
reduce sexual activity. Second, the number of abortions would
decrease because the total cost (including the cost of breaking
the law) would increase. Third, the birth rate would probably
increase because the decrease in abortions would likely outweigh
the decrease in pregnancies. Fourth, infant mortality and the
proportion of babies born at low birth weight would probably rise
because of the decrease in abortions [Grossman and Jacobowitz,
1981]. Fifth, the proportion of babies with congenital

abnormalities would probably rise. Sixth, the number of Illegal
and self—induced abortions would increase, with attendant
increases in mortality and morbidity.

Some effects are more difficult to predict. For instance,
the proportion of babies born to unmarried women might rise or
fall, depending on the differential responses of married and
unmarried women with respect to contraceptive behavior, sexual

activity, and illegal abortions and on changes in marital status
resulting from the ban.
The magnitude of all these behavioral responses would depend

on how vigorously the ban was enforced; weak enforcement produces
weak effects. Prostitution, for instance, Is Illegal in most
jurisdictions, but the ban is largely symbolic and only weakly
and sporadically enforced. Weak enforcement was also the norm
when several states had laws against the sale of contraceptives.
36

Two arguments in favor of a symbolic ban are that society's values
are made explicit and that the law may have some deterrent effect.
Arguments against a weakly enforced ban are that it invites corruption, leads to disrespect for the law in general, is likely to be
evaded more easily by some individuals than by others, and precludes
the possibility of regulations to protect health and safety.
Short of banning an activity, society may decide to regulate
it. through licensure laws and other means. Some activities are

regulated by requiring licenses of the users (drivers' licenses,
for example). More often, the providers of services must obtain
licenses and are subject to government regulation. Thus, many
reproduction—related services are controlled through the
licensing of health professionals and medical facilities. The
case for regulation and licensure of providers usually rests on
economies of scale in the provision of information. In the
absence of licensure, consumers presumably would have great
difficulty determining the qualifications and standards of those
offering the services. The danger lies in providers using
licensure and regulation to restrict competition.
If an activity such as abortion or surrogate mothering is to
be banned or regulated, which level of government should exercise
control? One argument In favor of federal standards is that they
would eliminate the possibility of border crossing to take
advantage of differences in laws. On the other hand, with respect
to the emotional issues related to reproduction, there may be a
case for controls at the state or local level where the values of
the local population can find expression.

37

Sources of Funding
Once legal status is determined, the most important public

policy issues usually concern sources of funding. In our society
most goods and services are paid for by individuals out of' their

own income and accumulated wealth, that is, according to their
ability to pay. This is true of some reproduction—related

services, but as with other medical care, many expenditures are
funded through private insurance or public programs.
Private insurance works best if' the probability of using a

service is known for the population as a whole, but not known for
individuals. With respect to reproduction—related services,
however, individuals frequently have much more information than
do the insurance companies about their desired family size,

attitudes toward contraception and abortion, and the like. If
companies base insurance premiums on the average cost of care for
the population as a whole, above—average users will be eager to
purchase insurance, but those with low probability of use will
not (adverse selection). The companies must then raise premiums
(making insurance even less attractive) and the private market
for insurance may not be viable. Given the high potential for
adverse selection, it is not surprising that reproduction—related
services have not been as comprehensively covered by health

insurance as other kinds of medical care. andatory insurance
coverage can alleviate the adverse selection problem, but this
approach will also increase the tendency toward overutilization.
Alternative sources of funds include philanthropy and
government subsidy. Such private and public subsidies are often

38

only available to the poor, and may be accompanied by
restrictions that are not applicable to those who can pay from
their own funds. An alternative approach is to treat the service
as a public service (such as fire and police protection) and have

the government pay for all. The choice of an appropriate funding
method requires a balancing of the desire of individuals to avoid
risk, the propensity to overutilize if a third party is paying

the bill, and social judgments concerning distributional equity.

Allocation of Resources

With legal status determined and a method (or methods) of
funding in place, a key public policy issue concerns the method
of allocating resources. The standard method in our economic
system is to allow buyers and sellers to compete and to let the
price be determined at the level where the quantity demanded
equals the quantity supplied. If the price is held below this

level (as with price controls), shortages will develop. If the
price is held above this level (as with many farm products),

surpluses will appear. Whenever there are shortages or surpluses
some additional rationing mechanism must be introduced to
apportion the resources.

Consider, for instance, the allocation of resources with

respect to neonatal intensive care. The market will not produce
an equal distribution——babies from wealthy families will receive
better treatment. But If the market is not allowed to allocate
resources, who will do so? Clearly, a policy of providing all

possible care to all infants——regardless of cost and the

likelihood of survival——is not feasible. Every society must
39

decide on a standard of appropriate care. In Britain and Sweden,
intensive treatment Is seldom given for infants weighing less
than 750 grams,1 while In the United States aggressive treatment
for infants weighing 500—750 grams is common (Young, 19814]. The

challenge is to define "appropriate" care without specifying
rigid cutoffs or formulas.

In vitro fertilization, surrogate mothering, and other
unusual ways of obtaining a baby also raise ethical questions
concerning the allocation of resources. Should access to these

services be determined in the market? If not, who will decide
which individuals receive which services? And what criteria will
be employed? Should personal characteristics such as age,
education, income, and marital status be considered? Should the

service be available only In cases of infertility, and if so, how
is infertility to be defined? What about cases where normal

pregnancy might pose a health risk for the mother or the child?
How much of a risk would justify an alternative such as surrogate

mothering? Are there other circumstances that would warrant
surrogate mothering or artificial insemination, such as Inability

to find a mate or a preference not to mate? If nonmarket
rationing is used in these areas, how will it be possible to keep
"black markets" from developing? Alternatively, will society be

willing to have different sets of eligibility criteria, depending
on whether the funding comes from government, philanthropy,
insurance, or direct payment?

As this brief discussion suggests, policy problems
concerning reproduction—related services are diverse and complex.

140

They are not. different in kind from those that are faced in many

other areas of the economy, but they concern activities that are
charged with emotion and that are undergoing rapid technologic

change. Scientific advances that Increase the ability to create
life, to sustain life, and to alter life open new possibilities
for the fulfillment of human desires; they also create

substantial dilemmas for public policy. We hope that health
professionals, philosophers, legal scholars, and social

scientists will work together toward their resolution.
