    "abstract": "\n\nModels of consumer behavior play a key role in modern empirical Industrial Organization. In this paper, I survey some of the models used in this literature. In particular, I discuss two commonly used demand systems: multi-stage budgeting approaches and discrete choice models. I motivate their use and highlight some key modeling assumptions. I next briefly discuss key issues of estimation, and conclude by summarizing some extensions.\n\n",
